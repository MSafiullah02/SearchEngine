In this study, synthetic first-generation siRNAs, designed against essential RSV genes, prevented RSV growth in cultured lung epithelial cells [3]. To translate this success to an animal model [4], we reasoned that the most logical route for delivery of these siRNAs should be the nose (intranasal). First, it is noninvasive. Second, it should involve relatively simple application procedures, such as nasal drops or aerosol inhalation. Third, the siRNA drug will follow the same route as the virus and reach the same tissues, including the lungs. Lastly, our subsequent results showed that the intranasally administered siRNA remains in the lung and does not leach into blood or other tissues, minimizing the risk of systemic side effects (data not shown). This is particularly important since, unlike cell-specific delivery reagents [5], the reagents used here (TransIT-TKO or HKP) are universally applicable, and therefore, intranasal delivery serves to have the cargo localized within the lung, providing specificity against respiratory infections. In this chapter, we have, therefore, focused on the intranasal delivery of anti-respiratory viral siRNAs.",

            "text": "We first summarize the progress made in four major respiratory viruses: RSV, parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (Flu), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4, 6, 8\u201311]. The first three viruses are clinically the most significant, claiming a large number of human lives each year throughout the world. Annual flu epidemics alone affect 10\u201320 % of the U.S. population, averaging about 114,000 hospitalizations. Currently, two strategies, vaccines and small molecule therapeutics, are utilized to control the spread of flu. However, the high mutation rate of RNA genomes in general and the reassortment of flu virus genome segments in particular are major hurdles in flu prevention and treatment. The rapid emergence of new flu strains that are resistant against the M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine) as well as the viral neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir) is a significant global concern [12]. RSV is the most significant cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and an important cause of acute respiratory illness in the elderly as well [13, 14]. In pediatric infection, PIV is second only to RSV [15]. Ribavirin and IFN, although partially effective in treating these infections, are both relatively nonspecific and toxic [14]. Regarding the molecular features, RSV and PIV are nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, belonging to different genera of the Paramyxoviridae family [6]. In contrast, flu is an Orthomyxovirus and contains segmented negative-strand RNA genome [9, 10]. Coronoviruses such as SARS-CoV contain positive-strand RNA genomes [11]. A commonality among these RNA viruses is that they encode genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to transcribe and replicate their own genomes, because the host animal cells are devoid of such activity. Many of the potent antiviral siRNAs have, therefore, targeted viral genes coding for RdRP subunits or proteins that are related to RdRP function [3, 4, 6, 9\u201311]. These early studies targeted: P (Phosphoprotein), L (Large) (see Table 1), and N (Nucleocapsid) genes of RSV; P and L genes of PIV; PA and NP genes of Flu; and the replicase gene of SARS-CoV. In all cases, siRNAs were designed against essential viral gene(s), optimized in cell culture and then used intranasally in the appropriate animal model. Antiviral activity was shown against RSV and parainfluenza virus (PIV) using the BALB/c mouse model as well [4]. In those studies, optimal results were obtained with siRNAs delivered in complex with either Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or Mirus Transit TKO reagent (see Subheading 2), although uncomplexed intranasal siRNA also showed some efficacy [4]. Intranasal siRNA, complexed with oligofectamine or polyethyleneimine (PEI), was also protective against highly pathogenic influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes in mice [9, 10]. Notwithstanding their success, the activity of these siRNAs was transient, lasting only a few days. Therefore, enhancement of the intracellular and extracellular stability of synthetic siRNAs while increasing (or without compromising) their RNAi activity is a continuing goal for therapeutic translation of RNAi.\n",

            "text": "A variety of chemical modifications, including terminal and internal ones, have been added to the first-generation siRNA sequences to improve stability and delivery, leading to what we call \u201csecond-generation\u201d siRNAs. Advantage has been taken of the free 2\u2032-OH group of the ribose moiety of RNA (in contrast to DNA that lacks this OH group), to which various substituents were added. We have pursued two promising ones, namely 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-O-Me) and 2\u2032-fluoride (2\u2032-F). The latter modification is placed on pyrimidine nucleosides (C, U), leading to 2\u2032-FC and 2\u2032-FU residues. In a number of previous studies [16\u201319], these substitutions were introduced to various extents in the antisense strand (\u201cguide\u201d strand) or both strands of the siRNA and were shown to enhance stability and potency, although intranasal application was not tested. Additionally, they tend to reduce siRNA-driven innate immune response [20, 21]. In systematic studies in cell culture, the biochemical and functional activity of the siRNA was vindicated but found to be affected by the position of the modifications in the sequence [16\u201319]. Generally speaking, those with the modified ribonucleotides at the 5\u2032-end of the antisense strand were less active relative to the 3\u2032-modified ones. Internally, while 2\u2032-F was generally well-tolerated on the antisense strand, 2\u2032-O-Me showed significant shift in activity depending on the position. In contrast, incorporation of 2\u2032-O-Me in the sense strand of siRNA did not show a strong positional preference. In a comprehensive study, however, internal 2\u2032-O-Me modifications in either or both strands actually made the siRNA less active [22]. In an animal experiment [23], all the 2\u2032-OH residues in siRNAs against hepatitis B virus were substituted with 2\u2032-F and 2\u2032-O-Me. When administered intravenously (i.v.) as lipid complexes, the 2\u2032-O-Me, 2\u2032-F siRNAs showed improved efficacy and longer half-life in plasma and liver. When these siRNAs were additionally Cy3-labeled, it revealed their accumulation in the liver and spleen, but not in the lung, explaining the success of the i.v. administration against hepatitis while suggesting that it is an ineffective route against lung infections.",

Copy and paste the target sequence in the box and initially choose AAN19TT in the \u201crecommended patterns.\u201d Usually, there is no need to change the \u201cFilter criteria\u201d below, i.e., leave them as in the default. Click on the Search button. With RSV L gene, we found many prospective ones (Table 1), but if no siRNA is obtained with your gene sequence, repeat the procedure, this time choosing NAN21.With flu, a proprietary algorithm was used and thus, the siRNA sequences (Fig. 2) are also intellectual property. In general, for a wider coverage of multiple virus strains and to minimize resistance, choose viral sequences that are most conserved.\n\nThis will lead to a table of prospective siRNA sequences that are ordered according to \u201cThermodynamic values\u201d by the default setting. The goal is to select sequences with high negative values, i.e., sequences closer to the top of the table. In addition, visually examine the central N19 part (i.e., ignore the first two and the last two nucleotides) and pick the ones that are AT-rich at the 3\u2032-end (right hand side) and GC-rich at the 5\u2032-end (left hand side). The number of sequences one can test really depends on available resources, but order at least 3 for a given target. Order the sense strand as N19dTdT and the antisense strand as (N\u2032)19dTdT, such that the N\u2032 part is complementary to the N19 sequence. Here, we provide an example of tested functional siRNA sequences based on the L polymerase gene of RSV (Table 1). Assume that you will receive the siRNA roughly a week after ordering. Purchase the smallest amount initially (to save money), generally 2 nmol of each.After receiving the lyophilized RNA (2 nmol), briefly spin the tubes to ensure that the RNA is at the bottom. Add 42 \u03bcl 1\u00d7 siRNA buffer to each RNA. Pipette the solution up and down 8\u201310 times, avoiding the introduction of bubbles.Place the solution on an orbital mixer/shaker for 30 min at room temperature for complete mixing. Briefly centrifuge the tubes containing siRNA to ensure that the solution is collected at the bottom of the tube.Combine the volumes of the complementary strands of RNA (42 + 42 = 84 \u03bcl), vortex for 10 s and centrifuge for 30 s. Add 16 \u03bcl of 6\u00d7 siRNA buffer to make 100 \u03bcl, mix.Heat the mixture at 60 \u00b0C for 45 min.Remove from heat and centrifuge briefly, 5\u201310 s.Allow solution to cool to room temperature over 30 min to allow formation of the double-stranded siRNA, which is now ready to use. The siRNA concentration of this stock solution is 20 \u03bcM (see\nNotes\n2 and 3).Aliquot the siRNA into small volumes and store at \u221220 to \u221280 \u00b0C.

Take the average of triplicate plaque assays for each sample.Select the most effective siRNA sequences (strongest antiviral effect) as candidates for 2\u2032-O-Me and 2\u2032-F modifications. For reasons mentioned in the Introduction, there is no universal consensus regarding the format. Thus, the guidelines offered here should be considered suggestions only, although the sequences shown have been tested to work (Table 1). The reader is encouraged to conduct more exhaustive modifications and test other sequences if resources permit.\nIntroduce 2\u2032-O-Me modifications in all sites in the sense strand initially, but then try less extensive modifications (at various positions), which are sometimes more effective.Introduce alternate modifications in sense and antisense strands. Start with 2\u2032-F (in available C\u2019s and U\u2019s) followed by 2\u2032-O-Me in the sense strand, and reciprocate in the antisense strand (Table 1).

We have also found them to be at least as potent as the first and second generation 19-mer siRNA in terms of intranasal anti-RSV activity without increased immune reactions. In preliminary experiments, they also lent well to 2\u2032-O-Me and 2\u2032-F modifications for intranasal antiviral activity (data not shown), but it is recommended that the exact format be optimized for each sequence. Follow the published D-siRNA design guidelines [24, 26].Although we have described the laboratory mouse model here, intranasal dosage and delivery can be easily scaled up or down for other laboratory animals.siRNA concentration: The pharmaceutical industry prefers expressing drug concentrations in wt/vol or wt/body weight (e.g., mg/kg). For the researcher, however, it is easier and more useful to express siRNA concentrations in molar units (e.g., \u03bcM or nM), since this allows direct comparison between the potency of different siRNAs even when they differ in base composition or modifications (and hence formula weight).Transfection reagent: siRNAs may respond differently to different reagents. Experiment with delivery reagent of your choice (Fig. 2).Avoid using excessive liquid because it may suffocate the animal and cause death. As a rule, keep the total instilled volume under 45 \u03bcl for BALB/c mice, but higher volumes may be tolerated by larger species.The protocol described here may be modified for aerosolized siRNA using an enclosure to house the anesthetized animal and a handheld nebulizer (the common type used as an inhaler by asthmatics). A larger amount of siRNA is needed because only a fraction of the aerosol is actually inhaled by the animal. If used routinely, consider optimizing a commercial motorized nebulizer. Check with the local pediatricians for the exact model, vendor, and usage. Modify the system by removing the facial mask at the delivery end and inserting the tube directly into the enclosure. A snug fit of the mask should reduce siRNA waste.\n",

The thermodynamic difference (\u2206\u2206G) of stability of the two termini is shown in parenthesis. Similar but more detailed considerations went into designing siRNAs against flu M2 and NP genes (not shown). All subsequent siRNAs were based on sequence #1 as shown. Bold = 2\u2032-O-Me modifications; underlined = 2\u2032-F modifications. We have confirmed the antiviral efficacy of both of these modified sequences in cell culture as well as in mice (data not shown). The dTdT part adds stability to the siRNA",

The number of flu strains showing match with the siRNA is shown on the Z-axis (vertical). The two horizontal axes represent 16 HA subtypes and 9 N subtypes. The N subunits are color-coded (N1 = brown; N2 = green, etc.), and well-known subtypes are indicated on the top (e.g., H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1). For example, the most broad-spectrum siRNAs against M2 can target 300 flu strains, including H1N1",
