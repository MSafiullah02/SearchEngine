The main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Pneumonia is much more serious. As well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. Three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. Resistance to penicillins has spread among H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The mechanism of penicillin resistance in H. influenzae is mainly by production of b-lactamases TEM-1 and ROB-1, whereas in S. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. Among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. Several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.",

In S. pneumoniae five high molecular weight PBPs are recognised: 1a, 1b, 2x, 2a and 2b. Presumably alteration of each of them could lead to increase in resistance to b-lactams [16] . Moreover, it has been shown that changes in the low molecular weight PBP3 have also been associated with resistance to b-lactams. The level of resistance is determined by how many and to what extent targets are modified [17] . Usually alterations in PBP2b are associated with an MIC\\ 0.1 mg/l and in many papers the pbp2b gene is nominated as being responsible for penicillin non-susceptibility [18] . However, several reports suggested that changes in other high-molecular weight PBPs could also increase penicillin MIC values in S. pneumoniae. The genes determining synthesis of the altered PBPs in pneumococci appeared by mutations and also were acquired from different species of streptococci, especially those of oral origen. The genes of resistant PBPs in pneumococci show specific mosaic structure, because they consist of segments of native pneumococcal DNA mixed with segments of foreign DNA [19] .",

Particular mechanisms depend on target modification or efflux [23] . The first, more common mechanism determines high level resistance and crossresistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLS(B) phenotype) [24] . Phenotype MLS(B) is conferred by the presence of the ermB (ermAM) gene, encoding an enzyme, methylase of 23s rRNA. This enzyme changes 23s rRNA of the bacterial ribosome by methylation of adenine (A2058) and makes it unsusceptible to all MLS(B) antibiotics [25] . More recently strains harbouring the ermA gene have been found with a similar phenotype to ermB [26] . In most cases production of methylase is inducible.",

Several reports suggest that H. influenzae isolates require at least one amino acid substitution both in subunits of gyrase (GyrA) and topoisomerase IV (ParC) in order to attain significant levels of resistance to quinolones [33] . H. influenzae can produce b-lactamase type TEM-1 or ROB 1. Strains producing TEM b-lactamases are more frequent. Both types of b-lactamase are sensitive to inhibitors, like clavulanic acid. b-Lactamase production as well as resistance to other antibiotics in H. influenzae has been associated with the presence of large, chromosomally integrated, conjugative plasmids [34] . In the last few years the proportion of H. influenzae strains resistant to ampicillin but not producing b-lactamase has been growing. These BLNAR (b-lactamase negative, ampicillin resistant) strains possess changes in PBPs that are responsible for the lowered affinity to ampicillin [35] . The most frequent mutation is localised in the genes ftsI encoding PBP 3A and/or PBP 3B which are involved in septal peptidoglycan synthesis. The role of mutation in the gene dacB encoding PBP 4 has not been confirmed [36] . It is possible that other, yet unknown, mechanisms of ampicillin resistance exist among BLNAR H. influenzae.",
