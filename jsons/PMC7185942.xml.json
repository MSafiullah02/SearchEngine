Although the main function of thrombin is to promote clot formation by activating platelets and by converting fibrinogen to fibrin,5 thrombin also exerts multiple cellular effects and can further augment inflammation via proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), principally PAR-1.5 Thrombin generation is tightly controlled by negative feedback loops and physiological anticoagulants, such as antithrombin III, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and the protein C system.5 During inflammation, all three of these control mechanisms can be impaired, with reduced anticoagulant concentrations due to reduced production and increasing consumption. This defective procoagulant\u2013anticoagulant balance predisposes to the development of microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure\u2014evidenced in severe COVID-19 pneumonia with raised d-dimer concentrations being a poor prognostic feature and disseminated intravascular coagulation common in non-survivors.1, 6\n",

In this context, it is therefore paramount to look at the role of PAR antagonists and other coagulation protease inhibitors. PAR-1 is the main thrombin receptor and mediates thrombin-induced platelet aggregation as well as the interplay between coagulation, inflammatory, and fibrotic responses, all of which are important aspects of the pathophysiology of fibroproliferative lung disease,5 such as seen in COVID-19. Although less likely to have an effect on venous thromboembolism, PAR-1 antagonists developed as antiplatelet drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease,8 might potentially attenuate the deleterious effects associated with activation of the coagulation cascade and thrombin formation. A clinically approved PAR-1 antagonist was shown to reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophilic lung inflammation, and alveolar leak during bacterial pneumonia and lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury in murine models.9, 10 Moreover, the role of PAR-1 in host immunity to viruses has been investigated: in one study, PAR-1 was protective against myocarditis from coxackie virus and decreased influenza A viral loads in murine lungs,11 while in another study, activation of PAR-1 following influenza A challenge was associated with deleterious inflammation and worsened survival,12 suggesting the initial PAR-1 activation is required for host control of virus load but if left unabated, PAR-1-mediated inflammation results in reduced survival. The half-life of vorapaxar, might be considered too prolonged in the context of managing acute illness, especially without a known reversal agent for its antiplatelet effect and the associated bleeding risk. However, it is important to note that in clinical trials of vorapaxar, most participants received both aspirin and a thienopyridine at enrolment,8 and PAR-1 antagonists (eg, RWJ58259), which never progressed to clinical trials, have short half-lives and could be revisited.",
