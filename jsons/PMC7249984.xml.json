It seems a bit premature to sort out all the implications and effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has on adult development. On the other hand, we are called upon as scholars, researchers, and teachers to begin reflecting on the physical, social, and psychological effects and the drain of resources such an epidemic might have on many people.",

The first issue coming to mind concerns the effect on young adults in emerging adulthood. There is great uncertainty about the future trajectory for young adults. Young adults may feel they are stopped in their tracks as they want to transition from high school to a job or to college. Others now face college-level classes online, and college graduates are wondering where to find a job, or they may be facing other unexpected developmental tasks. In his seminal work on the children of the Great Depression (Elder 1974), Glen Elder has written extensively about the effect of historical events. Likewise, Conger et al. (2004) reflected on the effect of the farm crisis in the Midwest of the United States. Some of the trajectories for young adults are going to be changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

With this relatively high fatality rate, older adults can easily be targeted and labeled as vulnerable. However, older adults belong to a very diverse group\u2014some have serious chronic health problems that would make them more susceptible to negative outcomes, but others remain healthy and active. Although the risk for older adults to contract COVID-19 is high, it must be noted that severe infections and significant mortality occur across the entire life course (Le Couteur et al. 2020). There is a possibility that during this pandemic old stereotypes reinforcing ageist perceptions are revived (Ayalon et al. 2020).",

Given stay-at-home policies, intergenerational ties are restricted, and the overall solidarity among parents, grandchildren, children, and grandchildren may be compromised. When younger adults get the impression that they are to stay at home to keep older adults safe, intergenerational resentment may ensue. Comparing active and productive younger adults to frail and vulnerable older adults does not help either generation come to terms with this crisis. Such views may underline negative images of aging among younger adults (Ayalon et al. 2020).",

As people get more frustrated over time, they may experience increased negative emotions, and these emotional experiences may be more difficult to regulate. Because of restrictions in movement, more loneliness or social isolation may occur. There is more of a risk for domestic abuse. In addition to these psychological and behavioral effects, we can also expect changes in physical health. As visiting a health practitioner is more limited and people feel more restricted at home (with heightened stress levels, limited physical exercise, less emphasis on good nutritional habits and disrupted sleep patterns), the pandemic may result in lasting effects on adult development (Schrack et al. 2020).",

Personal resilience refers to individual strength, personality, control, and the ability to use cognitive and behavioral strategies to deal with stressful situations effectively. Family resilience refers to optimal communication patterns and family cohesiveness during a time of crisis. Resilient communities develop environmental plans that allow people to feel safe when adversity hits. Studies suggest that negative perceptions are associated with loneliness and psychological distress, whereas positive self-perceptions of aging are associated with more resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak (Losada-Baltar et al. 2020).",
