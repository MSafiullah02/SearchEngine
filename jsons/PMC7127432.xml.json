A well-known example of this application is the production of the hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) in Escherichia coli, which has led to the first recombinant protein-based vaccines reaching the market using alum as adjuvant (Engerix-B\u00ae from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Recombivax HB\u00ae from Merck & Co., Inc.). Similarly, antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV), expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and Trichoplusia ni, are commercialised as Gardasil\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Cervarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), with alum and AS04\u00ae (a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)) as adjuvants, respectively. Other pathogens for which recombinant protein antigens have been identified and studied include hepatitis C and E and rotavirus (Ohtake and Arakawa, 2013).",

More importantly, protein-based vaccines may induce autoimmunity and allergic reactions, as reported, for example, in the development of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS) (Batzloff et al., 2004, Skwarczynski and Toth, 2011). For these reasons, efforts are currently focussed on the production of small peptides as antigens. These antigenic peptides can be identified through the analysis of specific antibody-inducing regions within larger proteins (epitopes), and are generally obtained through simple synthesis with high purity, in large scale, and at a lower cost (Gori et al., 2013, Purcell et al., 2007, Rosendahl Huber et al., 2014, Skwarczynski and Toth, 2011). Several peptide-based vaccine formulations have already reached the clinical development phase, as it is the case for some preventive HIV vaccines (Girard et al., 2006) as well as some therapeutic anticancer vaccines (Mohit et al., 2014, Ott et al., 2014).",

Essentially, nucleic acids such as plasmid DNA (pDNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) allow in situ production of the antigen by the cellular machinery of the host. This strategy mimics the natural infection by intracellular pathogens as it leads to the local formation of the antigenic molecule. Moreover, nucleic acids can be tailored to express antigens that are chemically or structurally different from their native form, with the intention of improving their immunogenicity (Alpar et al., 2005, Deering et al., 2014, Kramps and Probst, 2013). The main limitation of this approach is the low level of gene expression achieved upon administration, a limitation that can be overcome by designing effective viral and non-viral transfection vectors (Alpar et al., 2005, Mazid et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In the area of vaccination, nanotechnology has led to the development of nanostructures holding specific advantages for antigen delivery. First of all, as mentioned before, due to their particulate structure and nanometric size, similar to the ones of virus and bacteria, nanoparticles can mimic the natural infection process and be taken-up by the antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby leading to enhanced immune responses (Bachmann and Jennings, 2010, Reddy et al., 2006b, Storni et al., 2005, Zolnik et al., 2010). A number of authors have reported that particles in the nanometric range are particularly suitable for their interaction with the immune system (Fifis et al., 2004, Joshi et al., 2013, Reddy et al., 2007). In addition, in our lab, working with PLA\u2013PEG micro and nanoparticles, we have also observed that 200 nm-nanoparticles can enhance the transport of the antigen through the nasal mucosa more efficiently than microparticles, (either 1 or 5 \u03bcM) after intranasal administration (Vila et al., 2005). However, there is still some controversy regarding this issue, with other works supporting the idea that microparticles can elicit stronger immune responses (Gutierro et al., 2002, Kanchan and Panda, 2007). This disagreement may come from the difficulty to compare different studies, as many variables account for the total outcome of the immune response, such as the constituting biomaterials, the nature and doses of antigen, and the route of administration (Oyewumi et al., 2010). It has also been hypothesized that using nanoparticles may favour cellular immune responses through optimal interactions with CD8+ dendritic cell (DC) subsets (Bachmann and Jennings, 2010). For example, using model carboxilated polystyrene micro (2 \u03bcm) and nanoparticles (40 nm), loaded with ovalbumin (OVA) (Fifis et al., 2004), it was shown that nanoparticles were able to elicit significantly higher IgG and T-cell responses. Finally, it has been reported that a size below 100 nm is desirable if the purpose is to facilitate the transport of nanoparticles from the subcutaneous tissue up to the lymph nodes, where the antigens will be presented to mature immune cells for an adaptive immune response (Reddy et al., 2006a, Reddy et al., 2007).",

This property is mainly related to the particle size (Desai et al., 1996, Jani et al., 1990), and also to the composition, being favoured when the systems include mucoadhesive materials such as chitosan (Grabovac et al., 2005). Moreover, our group was pioneer in demonstrating that the modification of nanocarriers with polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, in different degrees, was also responsible for improved transport of those systems across the nasal mucosa (Tob\u00edo et al., 1998). Overall, the increased interaction of these systems with the mucosae boosts the antigen presentation in those areas, where the natural entrance of several pathogens usually happens, therefore mimicking the natural infection process. Mucosal antigen delivery, or needle-free vaccination, allows overcoming important limitations associated to parenteral immunization such as the high cost of preparation, the need for specific administration materials (needles and syringes) and specialized technical staff, and is also more likely to be well accepted by patients, altogether resulting in an improved vaccine coverage (Chadwick et al., 2010, Giudice and Campbell, 2006).",

Additionally, we developed a freeze-dried formulation in order to improve the preservation of the vaccine. The results observed upon a single intramuscular administration to mice indicate that the IgG levels were comparable to those obtained after vaccination with the alum-adsorbed antigen in a prime-boost scheme (weeks 0 and 4). We could also prove that these nanocapsules were adequate for the co-encapsulation of the TLR 7/8-agonist imiquimod (Vicente et al., 2013b), a formulation approach for nasal immunization, further discussed in the next section. More recently, we conducted experiments to assess the biodistribution of these nanocapsules after subcutaneous injection (Vicente et al., 2014). The results evidenced the formation of a depot, followed by a slow drainage of the nanocapsules towards the lymph nodes, where they accumulate (for illustration see Fig. 2\n).

Our results showed that after intranasal administration to mice, chitosan-based tetanus toxoid (TT) nanovaccine led to high and long-lasting IgG levels, which were comparable to those elicited by the alum-adsorbed vaccine administered intramuscularly (Vila et al., 2004). More recently, chitosan nanoparticles were studied for the association of the hemagglutinin protein of H1N1 influenza virus. After intranasal administration of hemagglutinin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles to mice, both the systemic and mucosal antibody levels (IgG and IgA) were significantly enhanced with respect to the controls (antigen in solution), and a T cell response was also reported. Importantly, after being challenged through the same route with the virus, the animals receiving the nanovaccine presented higher survival rates (Sawaengsak et al., 2014). In another study, chitosan nanoparticles were loaded with Streptococcus equi bacterial proteins and administered intranasally to mice. The results showed enhanced IgG and IgA responses as compared to those elicited by the antigen-loaded liposomes and the corresponding empty nanoparticles and liposomes (Figueiredo et al., 2012).",

The behaviour of OVA-loaded TMC nanoparticles was also compared with that of OVA-loaded PLGA and OVA-loaded TMC-coated PLGA nanoparticles, upon intranasal or intramuscular administration to healthy mice. While all formulations could enhance the immune response following intramuscular administration, only TMC nanoparticles were able to elicit an immune response after intranasal administration, a fact that was attributed to their increased interaction with the nasal mucosa (Sl\u00fctter et al., 2010a). The efficacy of these nanoparticles was also compared with that of TMC\u2013OVA conjugates, previously developed for intramuscular administration, which had shown adjuvant activity similar to that of TMC nanoparticles (Sl\u00fctter et al., 2010c). Upon intranasal administration of both TMC\u2013OVA conjugates (30 nm) and OVA-loaded TMC nanoparticles (300 nm), results have shown the conjugates' superiority in terms of the IgG and IgA levels elicited, a fact attributed to the higher uptake of these structures by the nasal epithelium (Sl\u00fctter et al., 2010b).",

The fundamental role of mannan was evidenced in view of the significantly higher IgG levels achieved, in comparison with the control formulations, i.e. non-targeted nanoparticles and the alum-adsorbed antigen. Moreover, the immune response was biased towards the Th1 pathway, as shown by an increased level of IgG2a, which is particularly important to confront tumour cells. In another study, OVA-loaded mannan-decorated PLGA nanoparticles were also found to elicit higher T-cell responses when compared with OVA-loaded non-decorated PLGA nanoparticles (Hamdy et al., 2011), after subcutaneous administration to mice. Finally, in vitro macrophage uptake studies performed using poly(2-hydroxiethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (P(HEMA-co-MAA)) nanogels, loaded with OVA, revealed a high internalization that was accompanied of a high production of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD86, CD40 and CD80 (Dur\u00e1n-Lobato et al., 2014).",

Upon oral administration of these decorated nanoparticles to mice, the immune response, in terms of IgG and IgA titres and cytokine production, was significantly higher with respect to non-functionalized nanoparticles. A novel approach recently explored comprises the modification of bilosomes (non-ionic surfactant-based nanovesicles containing bile salts) with glucomannan for oral antigen delivery (Jain et al., 2014a, Jain et al., 2014b). BSA and TT were used as model antigens and in vitro studies showed that glucomannan-modified bilosomes had an increased uptake by macrophages in comparison with the unmodified ones.
