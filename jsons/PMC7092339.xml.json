Different mechanisms have been described as facilitating obesity-induced hypertension, including increased activity of the central and peripheral renin\u2013angiotensin systems (RAS), chronic inflammation, and high levels of leptin [3\u20136]. Central effects of these factors elicit increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and arterial pressure in obesity [1, 5, 7]. In addition, obesity alone or in combination with hypertension decreases baroreflex sensitivity, impairing the control of SNA [5, 8\u201310].",

            "text": "However, the roles of specific brain cardiovascular control centers and the contributions of factors, such as the RAS and pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC) at those central nervous system (CNS) sites to obesity-induced hypertension have not been established. One of the most important brain areas involved in cardiovascular regulation is the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) [11\u201313], which is located in the dorsal hindbrain. The NTS is the first synaptic site of baroreceptor afferents in the CNS [14] and plays major roles in the impaired baroreflex function and sympathoexcitation associated with hypertension, including obesity-induced hypertension [10, 12, 15]. Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) is expressed at high levels in the NTS [12, 16] and is a significant contributor to these deleterious effects, as its activation by angiotensin II (ANG II) decreases baroreflex sensitivity [17]. Furthermore, the increase in arterial pressure and reduction in baroreflex sensitivity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) are associated with increased levels of the AT1R mRNA in the NTS [5], suggesting that central AT1R might be involved in these responses. Considering that the centrally mediated hypertensive effects of ANG II/AT1R involve the induction of neuroinflammation [1], unsurprisingly, an intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of synthesis of the PIC tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-\u03b1, or minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory effects, attenuates the HFD-induced sensitization of ANG II-elicited hypertension [18].",

Activation of AT1R in the NTS has been shown to blunt baroreflex function [17] and the overexpression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a protein that inhibits the intracellular actions of the AT1R, in the same nuclei improves baroreflex function and lowers blood pressure in SHR and rats with renal hypertension [21, 29]. Obesity-induced hypertension has been treated with different anti-hypertensive drugs, including AT1R blockers (reviewed in Kidambi and Kotchen [30]). In the present study, the blockade of AT1R in the NTS reduced the increased levels of MAP, the elevated LF of SBP and the impairment of the reflex bradycardia observed in HFD-fed rats, suggesting that the activation of AT1R in the NTS is an important mechanism underlying the cardiovascular changes produced in HFD-fed rats. The lack of an effect of losartan injections into areas adjacent to the NTS reinforces the specificity of the NTS in these responses. In addition to the increase in central RAS activity, particularly in the NTS of the HFD-fed rats, systemic RAS activity is also increased in these animals [6]. Furthermore, as the blood brain barrier becomes leaky in HFD-fed rats [31], the increased levels of peripheral ANG II in these animals might also reach the NTS and thereby activate AT1R, inducing an increase in MAP and a decrease in baroreflex function.",

            "text": "Baroreflex function has been shown to be a predictor of cardiac mortality [32, 33], and thus impaired baroreflex function should also be considered for neurogenic hypertension treatment. In this sense, AT2R overexpression improved the baroreflex function, similar to the observations in our previous study using the renovascular [12] and SHR [13] hypertension models. Furthermore, transduction of AT2R into the NTS increased the levels of Mas receptors and ACE2 expressed at this site in HFD-fed rats. Studies have demonstrated that ANG (1\u20137) in the NTS improves baroreflex function and reduces arterial pressure [34], whereas blockade of ACE2 in the NTS reduces baroreflex function [35]. Since the AT1R and AT2R expressed in the NTS are mostly localized in different neurons, with only a 7% overlap, according to a previous study [19], the data might suggest that AT1R inhibition and AT2R activation function through different mechanisms/circuits to dampen the cardiovascular system in hypertension. An open question is if the intra-NTS application of an AT2R agonist would improve the baroreflex function in HFD-fed animals. In rats with heart failure displaying a decreased level of AT2R in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the injection of an AT2R agonist in the RVLM induces a smaller decrease in MAP than in control rats [36]. As HFD-fed rats exhibit decreased expression of the AT2R mRNA in the NTS, an acute injection of an AT2R agonist in the NTS may not improve the baroreflex, but future studies are needed to address this question.",

In the present study, a slight decrease in the LF of SBP was observed in the HFD-AT2R group, but the effect was probably not sufficient to restore MAP. In addition, the LF of SPB is an indirect measurement of the SNA, and therefore has its own limitations. Thus, this slight decrease may not accurately reflect a reduction in SNA that would impact the peripheral resistance. In HFD-AT2R rats, we observed a decrease in baseline HR (~20 bpm). The baroreceptor reflex pathways provide a major excitatory drive to the cardiac vagal activity [37], thus the decrease in baseline HR might have been secondary to the improvement in the baroreflex. Interestingly, in the HFD-AT2R group, no change in the elevated levels of AT1R in the NTS was observed. Further studies are required to determine whether another mechanism activated by AT1R in the NTS of HFD is also involved under these conditions to maintain the higher levels of MAP, such as an increase in heart contractility or a humoral factor.",

Since cross-talk between the RAS and the immune system in the brain has been suggested, including during obesity [3, 18], an interplay between the RAS and PICs may also exist in the NTS and account for the change in baroreflex function in HFD-fed rats. In fact, IL-6 microinjections into the NTS attenuate baroreflex function [38], and the reduction in the IL-6 mRNA levels observed after overexpressing AT2R in the NTS might also account for the improvement in the baroreflex response observed in the HDF-fed rats. Conversely, TNF-\u03b1 injections in the NTS fail to induce any change in MAP [39], and thus the role of the increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the NTS remains to be determined. Importantly, the HFD induces different degrees of neuroinflammation in different areas of the brain [40]. In the present study, we also evaluated the expression of microglial and astrocyte markers in the XII and AP, which are adjacent to the NTS. No significant changes in either area were observed, indicating that, at least for the diet used in the present study, the inflammation occurring in the dorsal brainstem seems to be more specific to the NTS.",
