Results. After a median follow-up of 23 months, cumulative incidence of viral infections was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59-81) at 100 days and 77% (95% CI 67-87) at 1 year; 35 of 65 patients at risk had CMV reactivation (54%) and the rate of polyomavirus-virus-associated cystitis was 19% (13/70). Cumulative incidence of bacterial and fungal infections at 1 year were 63% (95% CI 51-75) and 12% (95% CI 4-19), respectively. Of note, only 1 invasive fungal infection occurred beyond 1 year after transplant (day +739). Conclusion. In conclusion, despite a high rate of viral infections in the early period, present data suggest a satisfactory infectious profile after T-cell replete haplo-HSCT using post-transplant Cy. These results may help clinicians to improve both prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial strategies in this emerging haploidentical setting.",

            "text": "One of the major limitations of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from haploidentical donor (haplo-HSCT) is the impaired immune reconstitution owing to extensive immunosuppression necessary to overcome human leukocyte antigen disparity. Despite important advances over the last decades, infections are still mostly responsible for toxicity and non-relapse mortality among transplanted patients, owing to prolonged immunosuppression related, or not, to chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1, 2) . A platform for T-cell replete haplo-HSCT using posttransplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) (3) showed a low treatment-related mortality (TRM) and a high feasibility with an acceptable safety profile. This type of haplo-HSCT seems to compare favorably with T-cell depleted methods, in terms of infectious complications (3, 4) . To further explore this topic, we report herein the incidence of infections in a single-center cohort of 70 consecutive patients receiving T-cell replete haplo-HSCT with post-transplant Cy at our center, in order to provide useful information about the post-transplant period after this type of emerging transplant platform.",

Present findings confirm that the infectious profile is better in T-cell replete vs. T-cell depleted haplo-transplantation (10); the lower incidence of infections observed after day +100 may reflect a partial and quite effective restoration of antimicrobial immunity during the post-transplant period in this type of haplo-HSCT. Importantly, the low rate of chronic GVHD seen in our cohort is likely to contribute to this phenomenon, as chronic GVHD is known to be a major risk factor of late morbidity and mortality (11) . Nevertheless, we found an unexpected 26% TRM incidence, higher than that originally reported with post-HSCT Cy (3); this may be a result of the inclusion of patients with more advanced disease in the haplo-HSCT program at our center.",

(13) found that 62% of patients presented with a viral infection in the first year. The 54% of CMV reactivations found here was comparable to the 38-50% reported in similar haploidentical settings (3, 12, 13); the slightly higher incidence that we found here may be explained by the longer follow-up in our series. The polyomavirus-associated cystitis rate of 19%, which is lower than that reported in the myeloablative setting (14) , is likely because of the different conditioning regimens in our cohort, although a role played by the different GVHD prophylaxis cannot be excluded; indeed, BK virus nephropathy was found to be more frequently associated with tacrolimus than with cyclosporine in recipients of kidney allografts (15) . Here, a quarter of the patients (18/70) received cyclosporine as GVHD prophylaxis. Interestingly, we confirm the lack of EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders, as recently reported also by Kanakry et al. (16) . We found a 12% incidence of fungal infections, none of them fatal; it is important to note that fatal episodes of fungal infections are among the major limiting toxicities associated with T-cell depletion in haplo-HSCT (17, 18) ; we cannot exclude a role played by the use of anti-mold prophylaxis during marrow aplasia, although it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions owing to the lack of a true control arm in our study, and to the low number of IFIs.

            "text": "In conclusion, the present single-center data on 70 consecutive patients receiving T-cell replete haplo-HSCT with post-transplant Cy confirm a high rate of viral infections before day +100 and a lower incidence of infections afterward, suggesting a satisfactory although non-optimal immune reconstitution after this type of transplantation. Future comparisons with other haploidentical platforms and/or other alternative stem cell sources (i.e., cord blood), as well as investigations of novel strategies of transfer of immunity are warranted. Furthermore, the present data may provide useful information in an attempt to improve control of infections by adequate prophylaxis and/or antimicrobial therapy in the early post-transplant period, after use of the emerging transplant platform of haplo-HSCT.",

Subsets are graphically presented as boxplots; (A) CD3 + /CD4 + cells; (B) CD3 + / CD8 + cells; (C) CD19 + cells; (D) CD16 + /CD56 + cells. Blood samples were collected on the planned day AE3 days according to logistical and/or clinical reasons: day +7 (n = 11), +28 (n = 12), +60 (n = 10), +100 (n = 4). Time points at days +14 and +21 are not reported in the Figure, because of close similarity to the very low values measured at day +7. Transplant Infectious Disease 2015: 17: 242-249",
