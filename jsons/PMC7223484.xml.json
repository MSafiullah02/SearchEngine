Since the early 1990s, medical and public health communities across the world have reported the growth of self-injury, the deliberate hurting of one\u2019s body by cutting, burning, self-bruising or other methods. While self-injury affects all age groups, research has consistently shown high prevalence among youth. In a systematic review of one hundred nineteen epidemiological studies across eighteen countries, the mean lifetime prevalence of self-injury (i.e., reporting at least one self-injuring episode in lifetime) was estimated to be on average 17.2% among adolescents (ten to seventeen years old) and 13.4% among young adults (eighteen to twenty-four years old), compared to 5.5% among adults (twenty-five years or older) (Swannell et al. 2014). Although the definition of self-injury has been the subject of contested debate (Chandler, Myers and Platt 2011), it is now widely accepted that most acts of self-injury represent behavioural problems distinct from suicide attempts (Nock et al. 2006) and are distinguishable from culturally sanctioned self-mutilations such as tattooing or body piercing (International Society for the Study of Self-Injury 2018).1",

            "text": "While most existing prevalence studies are done in North America (Swannell et al. 2014; Muehlenkamp et al. 2012), a handful of epidemiological studies have originated in Japan, a country in which mental illness is considered the fifth \u201cpriority disease\u201d for national medical service (Ito et al. 2013). Okada et al. (2010) reported a lifetime prevalence rate of 8.2% from a sample of Japanese junior high school students (n=2206, age range: twelve to fifteen). Similarly, in a study of 1784 junior and senior high school students (mean age: 14.5, age range twelve to seventeen), a lifetime prevalence rate of self-cutting was 9.9% (Matsumoto et al. 2008), which is slightly higher than the prevalence rate of 6.9% among 540 college students (Yamaguchi et al. 2004). According to two systematic reviews of prevalence studies across geographical regions (Swannell et al. 2014; Muehlenkamp et al. 2012), these estimates are slightly lower than those reported in North America, Europe, and other East Asian countries. Nonetheless, mounting anecdotal evidence from health professionals and educational specialists suggests that the number of youth engaging in self-injury may have been rapidly increasing in Japan, perhaps outpacing research and clinical efforts (e.g., Ishige 2006; Takahashi and Fujiu 2015; Asano 2015). According to a survey with school counselors at junior high and high school levels, over 98% of the respondents reported experiences working with students who self-injure (Matsumoto, Imamura, and Katsumata 2009).",

In their analysis of English movies, TV shows, music, and print news featuring self-injuring characters, Whitlock et al. (2009) identified a clear upward trend in the amount of media content featuring self-injury since 2000. There were twenty movies with explicit references to self-injury in the 2000-2005 period alone, whereas prior to the 1990s only two movies in the sample portrayed self-injury.",

            "text": "A corpus of research indicated that depictions of self-injury in movies and TV shows are often stereotypical and misrepresentative, as the self-injuring characters were predominantly \u201cWhite female cutters\u201d in their teens or early twenties (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009). This finding was replicated in another content analysis of forty-one English films wherein the stereotype of young women cutting themselves to mitigate acute negative emotion was readily prevalent and persistent (Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010). Feminist scholars have problematized the gendered and racially-skewed representation of the \u201cself-injurers\u201d in popular media. Brickman (2004) contends that media portrayal of self-injurers as vulnerable young girls perpetuates the \u201cdelicate cutter\u201d myth that reproduces a patriarchal assumption of female passivity. Echoing Brickman and other feminist thinkers, Bareiss (2017) also argues that representations of self-injury in popular Hollywood films, though somewhat challenging societal norms, ultimately reinforce normative expectations of young women who self-injure to be docile and submissive.",

Among many visual forms, manga2 has become one of the most influential media outlets, due to its large and lucrative market,3 entertainment value, affordability, and unique visual language representing internal thoughts and emotions of characters (Cohn 2010). Manga has been instrumental in building a shared cultural space among Japanese readers, covering virtually all topics imaginable, including sports, war, corporate life, child rearing, sex, cooking, usury, and medicine. Beyond entertainment, manga plays a wide array of roles in Japanese society \u2013 from a teaching tool, an information source, a behaviour guide, social commentary, an agent of socialization (Ito 2005), to a vehicle for government policy (Matanle, Ishiguro, and McCann 2014).",

Most manga first appear as a series in comic magazines, which are grouped by their gender-based readership, namely, magazines for men (dansei-shi) and for women (josei-shi). Each category is further divided into age-based subgenres including: sh\u014dnen manga (boy\u2019s comics targeting readers eighteen years old and younger), seinen manga (comics for young males age eighteen to thirty), seijin manga (comics for grownups), sh\u014djo manga (comics for girls eighteen years old and younger), josei manga (comics targeting young female adults age eighteen to thirty), and redicomi (\u201cLady\u2019s Comic\u201d for adult women). Sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga targeting young readers generally refrain from explicit nudity, violence and sex, while manga for adult audiences may carry R18 content.",

            "text": "Although Japanese consumers increasingly engage in cross-age, cross-gender readership, the gender-/age-based heterosexual marketing genres still firmly shape the styles and aesthetic of manga. For example, female characters in sh\u014djo manga tend to embody societal appearance norms, particularity girlish-cuteness (\u201ckawaii\u201d) culture typified by large staring eyes, frilly dresses, flowers, ribbons and hearts (Kinsella 1995). Traditional gender perceptions manifest more conspicuously in boys\u2019 and men\u2019s manga, in which female characters use a stereotypical feminine speech style more frequently than has been reported for natural speech (Unser-Schutz 2015). Working women in best-selling men\u2019s manga are typically portrayed as either excluded from careers or negatively constructed as being too masculine (Matanle, Ishiguro, and McCann 2014). Stereotypical gendering may also occur on the creator\u2019s side, as manga authors are likely to draw for audiences of their own gender. In other words, sh\u014djo manga are generally considered as comics \u201cfor girls, by girls,\u201d while sh\u014dnen manga are comics \u201cfor boys, by boys, about boys\u201d (Unser-Schutz 2015), based on a marketing assumption about readers relating to the characters of their own gender.",

It constantly reproduces dominant norms, cultural values and beliefs, including socially-embedded heteronormative gender norms and sexism, while offering readers an escape into an imaginative realm to pursue their desires and aspirations beyond the limitations set by societal norms. Indeed, what manga offers goes beyond mere escapism; via authentic depiction of a \u201cJapanese way of life\u201d (Ito 2005), it not only confirms social order but also challenges readers to reconsider the taken-for-granted worldviews, social hierarchy and norms. For Masuda (2015), manga\u2019s character-based narrative allows readers to \u201cexperience different types of the \u201cI\u201d and \u201crelate to the world by simulating the characters\u2019 thoughts and relationships\u201d (28) and invites readers to reassess their everyday life and explore alternative ways of being.",

While a few previous studies examined iry\u014d-kei manga (medical comics) featuring medical professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists) (Kishi et al. 2011; Matsuoka, Smith, and Uchimura 2011), little has been explored about how manga depicts a public health issue such as self-injury in everyday life context. Literature on the topic of self-injury in manga is virtually nonexistent. We were able to locate one brief report (written in Japanese) by Ishige (2006) that examines self-cutting portrayed in sh\u014djo manga published between 1973-2005, along with folklore and popular songs. Looking at sh\u014djo manga featuring wrist-cutting, Ishige asserts that the meaning ascribed to self-injury has been changing over time from a suicide attempt to a coping strategy. However, although Ishige\u2019s study offers a meaningful introduction to this largely under-explored topic, the author does not provide a detailed documentation of the search strategy, analytic method, and the content of manga examined. It remains unknown as to what types of characters were depicted to engage in self-injury and which set of meanings were associated with the act in each narrative. In addition, there seems to be a significant increase in the volume and variety of manga featuring self-injury since Ishige\u2019s study, especially in genres other than sh\u014djo manga.",

This study also intended to expand the scope from sh\u014djo manga to encompass other types of manga targeting different audiences in terms of gender and age. Given the gendered nature of manga, one can hypothesize that boys\u2019 manga and girls\u2019 manga may differ in portraying characters who self-injure, as well as meanings ascribed to each act. Exploring the content of manga featuring self-injury thus leads to an important realization about how this mass medium constructs a perceived reality of self-injury, and in so doing, shapes public perceptions of this phenomenon.",

To update and expand Ishige\u2019s work, we chose to analyze manga published between 2000 to 2017, and broadened the focus to include other marketing genres than sh\u014djo manga, such as sh\u014dnen manga, seinen manga, and Boy\u2019s Love, a subgenre of josei manga featuring homoerotic relationships between male characters. As we were most interested in depiction of self-injury in everyday life contexts, we limited our focus onto nichij\u014d-kei (\u201cslice-of-life\u201d) genre that features realistic depictions of everyday life, excluding science fiction, fantasy, picaresque romance and other genres that take place in imaginary worlds. Manga featuring overt suicide attempts and culturally sanctioned forms of self-mutilation (e.g. tattooing, body-piercing) were also excluded. As such, our sample did not include a distinct manga genre featuring Yakuza (Japanese mafia) and Yankee (gangster) subculture that frequently portray ritualistic self-injury including yubitsume (a ritual of finger amputation to atone for one\u2019s misdeed) or konj\u014d-yaki (a test of courage by burning skin with a cigarette). These self-mutilation rituals serve as staples of Yakuza/Yankee manga and movies as a sign of underground camaraderie among clan members, but did not meet our eligibility criteria.",

Informed by previous quantitative content analysis of movies featuring self-injury (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009; Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010), two authors first collaboratively developed a coding rubric to capture: 1) demographic data of the characters who self-injure (i.e. gender, age, occupation, sexual orientation, whether the characters are portrayed as engaging in habitual self-injury); 2) methods of self-injury depicted (e.g., cutting, burning, hitting); 3) locations of self-injury on the body (e.g. wrist, forearm, thigh); 4) presence of other characters at the scene of self-injury; and 5) mental and/or physical health intervention after self-injury. Two authors then individually read five manga each to qualitatively analyze: 6) events that triggered self-injury; 7) degree of suicidal intent (e.g., overt, implied, none); 8) consequences of self-injury; and 9) perceived functions of self-injury. In this process, perceived functions of self-injury were determined in accordance with the antecedents and consequences implicitly and explicitly portrayed in narratives. As manga contains a complex system of symbolic meaning combining multiple visual and textual subcodes, the authors paid close attention not only to plots, characters\u2019 facial expressions and dialogues but also backgrounds (e.g., tones of the scene), onomatopoeia, frames, and characters\u2019 interior monologues implying particular meanings associated with each self-injurious act. Klonsky\u2019s (2007) seven-function model also provided a guiding framework for coding of the perceived functions. The seven functions include: affect regulation, anti-dissociation, anti-suicide, interpersonal boundaries, interpersonal influence, self-punishment, and sensation seeking.",

For others with recurrent self-injury, the meaning associated with self-injury varies depending on the motivation at the time, the relationship with the others in presence, and the frame of reference drawn to interpret the act. For example, a young female protagonist of Tobira (Momochi 2002) engages in self-cutting twice through the story; the first time is to express a blood oath of friendship with her classmate who habitually self-injures, and the second time is to attempt suicide in front of her mother. The protagonist, Manatsu, flexibly interprets self-injury first as a gesture of social bonding, then as a means to communicate her suicidality to her mother.",

For example, in Piet\u00e0 (Haruno 2000), the protagonist, Rio (a female high school student), is portrayed as cutting herself after having a flashback nightmare of her vicious stepmother. She is depicted as though not noticing her self-cutting until blood is dripping on the kitchen floor.

With respect to consequences of self-injury, in twenty-nine of forty scenes examined (72.5%), self-injury does not result in any treatment or intervention. Six scenes (15%) were categorized as \u201cunspecified\u201d because these scenes depict either the character recalling a past self-injury episode, or the story stops right at the moment of self-injury then leaps to a few days/months later with no reference to whether a treatment or intervention was offered to the character. There is little direct depiction of mental health treatment provided to characters after self-injury, except for one manga (Tobira) in which the mother of the protagonist saw a psychiatrist for advice after her daughter\u2019s wrist-cutting. In terms of informal support, ten characters (55.6%) receive support from partners and friends, while parents and siblings seldom served as a source of support. The reactions of partners and close friends tended to be empathetic and contributing to the characters\u2019 recovery from self-injury, while parents, siblings and distant peers (e.g., classmates) are shown to be indifferent or react aversively to the character. In some of the manga examined, family members are portrayed as a direct trigger of self-injury. For example, in Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and Ushida 2003, 3 volumes), a high school girl, Midori, faces constant pressure from her mother to succeed in school, marry a rich man, and take the mother out of her unhappy marriage.

Results indicate that manga\u2019s depiction of self-injury are largely congruent with previous research on self-injury in English films (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009; Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010; Bareiss 2017), in which characters who self-injure are predominantly heterosexual female in their late teens, engaging in habitual self-cutting.

Most characters who self-injure are portrayed as using self-injury as a strategy to cope with negative emotions, punish themselves, or interrupt a dissociative episode rather than as an act of suicide attempt. In two of five scenes in which characters are depicted to have overt or implied suicide intent, wrist-cutting is used in combination with more lethal methods such as jumping and intoxication, implying perceived low lethality of wrist-cutting. In alignment with Ishige\u2019s (2006) observation that wrist-cutting no longer signals suicidal ideation in the post-1980 manga, this finding indicates that while the depiction of wrist-cutting may still evoke a traditional cultural reading that connects the act with suicidal intent, the interpretation of habitual wrist-cutting as a coping mechanism to endure \u201cthe pain of living\u201d (Amano and Ise 2016) may be increasingly incorporated into the Japanese popular cultural imagination. Given that research indicates habitual engagement in self-injury elevates suicide risk and provides a \u201cgateway\u201d for suicide (Whitlock et al. 2013), potential implications of this interpretation warrants caution.",

Across the forty scenes examined, self-injury is portrayed as a stigmatized behaviour that makes the characters feel ashamed, and they conceal their behaviours and scars from others. However, more than half of the characters who self-injure eventually receive emotional support from significant others who help them recover from habitual self-injury. While a similar finding was reported in a previous study in which self-injuring characters receive informal support from friends and family (Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010), in the present study the sources of support are primarily romantic partners and close friends; reaction by families, parents in particular, to the self-injuring characters tend to be unsupportive and aversive, or even triggering, like the mother in Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and Ushida 2001-2003) who desires to use her daughter to compensate for her unhappy life. In such a context, character\u2019s self-injury is portrayed as a form of resistance against repressive parental domination, similar to Bareiss\u2019s (2017) analysis of films featuring self-injuring girls. In addition, the absence of parental support for self-injury can also be explained by the prevalence of a bildungsroman theme in both sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga, in which conflict with parental figures often serve as a catalyst for self-actualization for young characters.",

As sh\u014djo manga serve young female readers as \u201ca model for reality\u201d (Masuda 2015), these manga may invite readers to walk through life struggles with the protagonists and frame self-injury as a maladaptive but understandable response to contemporary pressures placed upon young girls.

Of particular interest is the emergence of \u201cmenhera\u201d characters in two seinen manga published since 2012, in which male protagonists are attracted to menhera girls who exhibited mental instability, fear of abandonment and insecure romantic attachments. For these menhera girls, self-injury is not just an act of affect regulation but also an identity label that shapes their role in the narrative. The menhera character can be seen as a twisted variant of the damsel in distress, a classic narrative trope in literature that involves young, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by a hero. They were placed in a predicament not by a monster or a villain but by mental illness that makes them prone to risky behaviour such as self-injury or sexual promiscuity. Contrary to characters that self-injure in sh\u014djo manga, these menhera girls are clearly subjected to the male gaze that objectifies and fetishizes the female self-injured body, while attention is deflected from underlying causes of self-injury. Although it may be too na\u00efve to believe that readers take such a portrayal at face value, this fetishized gaze toward menhera girls nonetheless provides its overwhelmingly male readers with a highly gendered interpretive repertoire. An inquiry into these two contrasting views would make a valuable contribution to the understanding of public perception on mental illness in Japan.",

In their content analysis of English films, Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister (2010) report that male characters who self-injure engage in more diverse methods of self-injury than females. Exploring subculturally sanctioned body mutilations in sh\u014dnen, seinen and seijin manga targeting male readership may imply how these self-injuries have distinctive meaning in Japanese popular culture in contrast to the pathologized and highly gendered portrayal of self-injury explored in this study. In this process, applying a critical gender lens to these representations would substantially enrich future investigation. Moreover, future exploration into self-published doujinshi (indie comics) and web comics with self-injuring characters would further expand this field of inquiry. With the advancement of indie comic markets and self-publishing online tools, Japanese readers are increasingly exposed to less filtered and more direct depictions of violence and human suffering including self-injury, suicide, and other mental health issues. This line of research could analyze how this emergent subculture represents self-injury in comparison with mainstream manga, focusing particularly on the \u201cmenhera\u201d characters and on unique behavioural and affective attributes they embody.",

First, manga has been deeply embedded in contemporary Japanese society to the extent that its power to shape public understanding of mental health issues cannot be underestimated. Manga representations of self-injury examined in this study offer a complex commentary on self-injury and have likely influenced, to varying degrees, readers\u2019 perceptions of how people who self-injure could be like and should be treated. As manga is considered providing young readers \u201ctextbooks for living\u201d (Masuda 2015, 28), some readers may turn to these manga to make sense of their own engagement in self-injury. The portrayal of emotional support from partners and close friends observed in this study may induce a sense of hope among readers who self-injure, while reducing the feeling of social isolation commonly reported by youth engaging in self-injury (Whitlock et al. 2013). Meanwhile, the general absence of support from family (parents in particular) found in this study is concerning, because this tendency may perpetuate existing stigma associated with self-injury and promote the vilification of parents.",

Indeed, remarkably little has been written about the positive therapeutic potential of manga for readers with mental health issues.
