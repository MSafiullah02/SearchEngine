Analyses of measurements demonstrated that hoof pastern angle had a linear relationship with craniocaudal stance of the horse. The relationship of joint angle and stance was greater for the distal interphalangeal joint angle than the proximal interphalangeal joint angle. The distal phalanx angle did not change with craniocaudal stance variation. The proximal interphalangeal joint width, distal interphalangeal joint width, or distal phalanx height did not change with lateromedial stance variation, nor within a 15 degree dorsolateral to caudomedial and dorsomedial to caudolateral variation from the dorsopalmar axis.

Eight months after the last treatment, horses were all \u2018boosted\u2019 with 100 g of barley. Blood and saliva were collected from the horses before and 2 weeks after each treatment and tested with an ELISA for IgG antibodies to two Culicoides proteins. After the transgenic barley treatment, three of four horses showed an IgG1 response and all four horses were successfully boosted, significantly different from controls. A competitive inhibition ELISA showed that after the boost, transgenic barley\u2010treated horses\u2019 sera inhibited binding of IgE to one of the Culicoides proteins. A further competitive inhibition ELISA showed that the two proteins are not fully cross\u2010reactive. These results show that the transgenic barley is effective at inducing an allergen\u2010specific response and that antibodies produced are able to partially inhibit IgE binding to allergens from Culicoides species.

Circles induced a movement pattern similar to an inside hindlimb lameness, which was significantly associated with the circle\u2010induced greater asymmetry of dorsoventral movement of the thoracolumbar region.
