The sequence and structural features of these molecules cover a gamut of length and size in terms of nucleotides, molecular mass, cellular localization and biological functions. At one end of this spectrum lie small RNAs (~10\u2013100 nucleotides) that include heteronuclear RNAs, small nuclear/nucleolar RNAs and group-I introns, tRNA and small regulatory RNAs like miRNA, siRNA and piRNAs [1]. Further along this spectrum are long non-coding RNAs (>200 nucleotides) like HOTAIR [2] that are believed to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and ribosomal RNAs that encompass larger sequence lengths, ~1400 and ~3000 nucleotides for 23S and 30S rRNAs (prokaryotic 70S ribosome), respectively. With the surge in high-throughput sequencing technologies, numerous small and long non-coding RNAs have been identified, and several reviews comprehensively discuss the functions of these classes of RNAs [3\u20135]. Finally, at the other end of this spectrum lie many RNA viral genomes ranging in size from ~1.7 kb for hepatitis delta virus to ~30 kb for Coronaviridae.",

These structures are composed of basic building blocks formed by simple helices and loops that associate with a number of ways to generate a variety of tertiary structures. Many viral genomic RNAs are reported to assume a highly complex, extensive and dynamic structural landscape, during different stages of their life cycle as illustrated from studies on dengue virus [6]. This landscape is studded with many RNA structural modules or units that play critical roles in regulating different stages of translation from initiation to termination. The past two decades have witnessed a steady progress in the studies involved in identifying the presence of such RNA structures in viruses. While a combination of chemical-probing techniques and high-throughput sequencing have yielded the entire \u2018structuromes\u2019 of viruses like HIV-1 [7], continuous efforts employing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have shed light on various relatively well-defined, smaller RNA structures that are located in specific regions of viral genomes, for example 5\u2032/3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs), coding regions, overlapping genes, etc. [8].",

            "text": "While many viruses carry their own enzymatic machinery for autonomous genome replication, transcription, genome assembly and packaging, they completely lack the translational apparatus required for protein synthesis. Apart from the limitations posed in terms of their utter dependency on host translation machinery, viruses are also under tremendous selective pressure to optimize their coding capacity due to their small genome sizes. In order to evade the multiple immunity barriers of their host cells, viruses have evolved countermeasures of their own to disrupt the host\u2019s antiviral mechanisms. As a result, they possess highly sophisticated strategies by which they bypass the normal translation process of their host to recruit the translation apparatus in alternative ways. Furthermore, the different types of mRNAs that are synthesized in viruses exhibit various features that determine the kind of alternative translation they are involved in. For example, the presence or absence of a 5\u2032-cap or a cap-substituted structure in which, unconventional 5\u2032-moeities cap viral mRNAs instead of m7G (7-methyl Guanosine [9]), presence or absence of poly-A tails at 3\u2032-end and finally presence of a range of tertiary structures in either 5\u2032/3\u2032-UTRs, intergenic or coding regions. These alternative translation schemes fall under an umbrella term \u2018Non Canonical translation\u2019 strategies. Which is why a wide range of functions involved in controlling and commandeering the host translation apparatus are encoded by viruses [10]. These alternative or non-canonical translation strategies are often mediated by RNA structures encoded within the viral genomes.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic translation initiation requires recognition of a 5\u2032-modified nucleotide cap (m7GpppN, N = A/C/U/G) of mRNA by pre-initiation complex machinery containing 40S ribosome and some initiation factors (eIF4F, formed by three polypeptides, viz.eIF4FA, eIF4E and eIF4G). As the mRNAs of many positive sense RNA viruses do not possess this cap structure, the canonical signatures for the recruitment of 40S subunit of ribosome are absent. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element is an RNA sequence present in either 5\u2032-UTRs (example\u2014Picornaviridae family) or intergenic regions (example\u2014Virgaviridae family) of some viral mRNAs that recruit the ribosome at an \u2018internal\u2019 position for translation, in a cap-independent manner (Figure 1). These sites were first identified in poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus mRNAs, which possessed unusually long 5\u2032-UTR regions with multiple non-initiating AUG codons scattered throughout this sequence [14, 15]. These sequences were proposed to fold in order to adopt highly organized, complex RNA structures that were capable of recruiting ribosomes to initiation \u2018AUG\u2019 codons internally on mRNAs that lacked a conventional m7G 5\u2032-cap. Since their discovery, various IRES elements have been identified in the genomes of other RNA virus families, the best characterized examples belonging to Dicistroviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae [16] as well as cellular mRNAs, from both bioinformatics-based predictions and experiments [17]. Viral IRES elements are broadly divided into four groups depending on their secondary structure, involvement of eukaryotic translation factors and distance between IRES element and start codon. Group I IRES-RNA structures bind to the ribosome directly in absence of any protein factors and initiator methionyl-tRNAi [18\u201320]. Group II IRES-RNA structures bind to 40S subunit directly along with certain initiation factors like eIF2/3 and Met-tRNAi [21, 22]. Group III and IV IRES-RNA bind ribosomes in presence of additional IFs and proteins described as IRES trans-activating factors (ITAFs) [23, 24]. Most of the available structural information about known IRES-RNA structures comes from groups I and II as they directly bind to ribosomes. On the other hand, due to a gap in our understanding of the mechanism by which ITAFs interact with IRES sequence/structure motifs to recruit ribosome, not much is known about IRES belonging to groups III and IV.",

In the structure from group I IRES belonging to viruses in Dicistroviridae family, three pseudoknots I, II and III and two conserved stem\u2013loops IV and V were found to interact directly with the ribosome [26, 27]. The different stem\u2013loop segments in full-length IRES structures are often brought together by long-range tertiary interactions like pseudoknots, kink-turns and A-minor interactions (Figure 2A, B) as identified by studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus [28\u201331]. In 2013, a full-length structure of an IRES element from HCV at atomic resolution was presented [32], which combined data from small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulation for generating a model structure for HCV IRES. The study used the data from available cryo-electronmicroscopy (cryo-EM) maps of ribosome-bound IRES structures to assemble and fit the atomic resolution structures available for its constituent modular units. The study illustrated that full-length HCV IRES is composed of many extended structured regions that are connected by flexible linkers, such as four-way junctions and pseudoknots [32]. Molecular dynamics simulations have also been used for studying the conformational plasticity of individual IRES domains, dynamics involved in the folding of separate modular units of IRES element from HCV and its dependence on Mg2+/Na+ ions [33, 34].",

Such variation in the IRES elements for HCV genome has been documented in HCVIVdb [35] database, which could be used for deducing the effect of sequence variations on different structural domains. Database like IRESite [36] houses the complete list of experimentally and computationally annotated IRES sequences from a broad range of eukaryotic viral and cellular sources (Table 1). The IRES sequences have been found to be poorly conserved among different viral families, although sequences within a single family have shown similarity to a certain level [37]. The low sequence homology among different viral families poses a further bottleneck in in silico IRES prediction using BLAST searches [17]. However, the IRES elements do show similarity at the level of their secondary structure with many sequences adopting an extended structure composed of multiple stems and loops (Figure 2). The similarity found at the level of secondary structures can be used for comparative structural alignment of predicted secondary structures with known IRES elements and could provide a basis for de novo IRES prediction. This strategy is used by programs like IRSS [38] and online prediction server VIPS [39], which were developed to predict IRES, based on secondary structure prediction using minimum free energy methods [40, 41] and subsequent structure alignments using RNALFold [42] (Table 2). More recently, a new IRES prediction tool had been developed for searching these sites in eukaryotic and viral genomes based on support vector machines, called IRESPred [43], and employs ~35 classifiers including predictions of secondary structure [44] and interaction probabilities between 5\u2032-UTR sequences and proteins from the small ribosomal subunit [45] (Table 2). However, many of these programs that were developed into web servers like VIPS, IRSS and IRESPred are not maintained anymore.

            "text": "Frameshifting is a recoding mechanism, first described in Rous sarcoma alpha retrovirus where the gag-pol genes were found to be co-expressed from a single polycistronic transcript [46]. Frameshifting is widely used by retroviruses for efficient replication of their genomes and infection [47, 48]. Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) can occur when the ribosome is systematically guided to express open reading frames (ORFs) that are shifted by \u22121 (Figure 1), \u22122 [49] or +1 [50] reading register with respect to each other. It has been reported recently that organisms other than viruses also employ frameshifting to express the overlapping ORFs [51\u201353]. \u22121 PRF process per se is coordinated by three key determinants: a 7 nucleotides long \u2018slippery-site\u2019, a 5\u20139 nucleotides long spacer sequence and an RNA structure that could be either a simple stem\u2013loop or a pseudoknot. Several studies have reiterated the fact that an RNA pseudoknot is a more efficient stimulator of frameshifting than a structurally simple hairpin loop [54, 55]. According to Recode V2.0 database, a large number of viruses use an H-type pseudoknot for efficiently mediating \u22121 PRF process [56]. In single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV) [57], Luteoviridae (sugarcane yellow leaf virus) [58] and Astroviridae [59] families, \u22121 ribosomal frameshift has been found to be modulated by RNA pseudoknots. The retroviruses (HIV-1, HTLV-2) [60, 61] display involvement of both pseudoknots as well as extended hairpins in the process [62].",

Crystallographic and NMR studies have suggested that the two helical stems in these H-type pseudoknots are twisted and bent with respect to each other [63\u201365], as observed from the solution structure of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot where the two helical stems showed a bending angle of ~121\u00b0 [66] (Figure 2D). This kink/hinge arises mainly due to a single nucleotide in loop 2 that intercalates itself between the helical stems, thus preventing co-axial stacking of the two helices. The loop and stems interact through multiple non-canonical hydrogen bonds involving the sugar edge of stem nucleotides and Watson\u2013Crick face of loop bases, thus providing added mechanical strength to the structure [8, 67]. The structural features of frameshift inducing RNA pseudoknots have been discovered mainly by NMR [66, 68], crystallographic [69] and molecular dynamics studies [70, 71], which also highlight the importance of ions and ion-coordinated water molecules in holding such a compact structure together. The physical significance of the presence of a kink in frameshift inducing structures is important as it was observed that structurally simpler hairpin structures also displayed a kink between their helices [72, 73] although the helices in these hairpins were larger than the constituent helices of retroviral and luteoviral pseudoknots [72] (Figure 2C).",

            "text": "PRFdb [74] catalogs the programmed ribosomal frameshift signals filtered from Yeast Genome project and Mammalian Gene Collection [75]. As is the case with IRES elements, RNA structures (pseudoknots/hairpins) share little sequence similarity among different viral families, although within a sub-group the sequence signals do exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation, as was observed for retroviruses. The length of these structures vary from the tightly compact polerovirus and enamovirus pseudoknots (<30 nucleotides) to extended coronaviral structures (>200 nucleotides). This renders their in silico prediction extremely difficult. Recent studies have been devoted to search for existing PRF signals and develop predictive rules for identification of novel signals, not only in viruses but also across different domains of life, e.g. KnotInFrame [76] and FSFinder [77, 78]. These algorithms employ a set of rules in which a preliminary screening of putative frameshift sequences is done based on consensus slippery sequence motif (X XXY YYZ) followed by secondary structure prediction on filtered sequences using minimum free energy programs like pknotsRG [41] and RNAFold [40] (Tables 1 and 2). While some algorithms can predict stem\u2013loop frameshift structures (FSFinder), others take into account the pseudoknot stimulators in \u22121 PRF (KnotInFrame). The accuracy of the prediction of novel \u22121 frameshift signals could be further augmented by the fact that overlapping regions from different RNA viral sub-groups show high sequence similarity, a feature that could be used to increase the reliability of secondary structure prediction (Table 2). Apart from these predictive programs, databases like FSDB [78] store all the experimental and predicted frameshift hotspots, and RECODE-2 [56] houses all the information related to translation recoding events and signals involved. Programmed frameshifting is also utilized by prokaryotic and mammalian genomes for translating multiple products from same set of ORFs. FSscan [79] predicts such +1 frameshift signals in Escherichia coli. A remarkable feature that has been observed in case of \u22121 PRF inducing RNA structures is that relatively smaller structures like RNA pseudoknots from MMTV and other viruses can act as ribosomal roadblocks and induce \u22121 PRF. This extraordinary ability has been attributed to not just the thermodynamic and mechanical strength of these structures but also to their conformational plasticity, defined by their abilities to adopt alternate conformations during unfolding, as documented in recent RNA unfolding studies employing optical tweezers [80, 81].",

            "text": "Ribosome shunting is a translational mechanism that comprises features of both 5\u2032-cap-dependent translations but is partially independent of internal sequence scanning. It was first discovered in plant pararetroviruses in the family Caulimoviridae and subsequently in rice tungro bacilliform virus [RTBV, a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)-related plant pararetrovirus] [82, 83]. It was found that the mRNA (also pregenomic RNA, pgRNA) leader sequences in the members of this family were unusually long. The long leader sequences folded into a large stem\u2013loop structure and contained several small ORFs (sORFs) (Figure 1). Different chemical and enzymatic probing studies have shed light on the architecture of this structure. In CaMV, a sORF and a strong downstream hairpin constitute a minimal shunting element. In CaMV, the 40S subunit along with a complement of initiation factors assemble at 5\u2032-cap of mRNA, scan for a short 60\u201370 nucleotides downstream till an AUG codon of the proximal sORF. All the scanning ribosomes assemble at this codon to form complete 80S subunit. After initiating translation of the first sORF and release of the newly formed short peptide, the 80S ribosomes disassemble. A fraction of the remaining 40S ribosome then shunts (bypasses) over the downstream 500 residue-long sequence that assumes a thermodynamically stable structure and consists of multiple sORFs (Figure 1). After shunting, the scanning continues for a short distance downstream until the nearest start codon of the first large ORF and translation is reinitiated [84]. Chemical and enzymatic probing studies suggest that the shunting structure present in the 35S leader sequence of pgRNA of CaMV alternates between a long-range pseudoknot, connecting central and terminal parts of leader and a hairpin dimer at high ionic strength [85]. Shunting is believed to expand the coding capacity of mRNA by directing the ribosomes to internal coding regions by bypassing upstream sORFs. The shunting mechanism is employed by all genera of plant pararetroviruses, late adenovirus mRNA and animal viruses [86, 87] and is found to be conserved in all plant pararetroviruses, making it a widely used strategy of non-canonical translation.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic translation terminates at three stop codons, namely UAA, UAG and UGA, mainly due to recognition of these codons by class I release factors (eRF1) [91] and because of absence of any cognate tRNAs that might contain an appropriate anticodon sequence to recognize and pair with these codons [92]. The termination process not only depends on stop codon sequence but also on the proximal contextual sequence with some bases resulting in a significantly \u2018leaky\u2019 stop signal [93]. These leaky codons allow \u2018read-through\u2019 of the translating ribosome (Figure 1). In this process, the stop codon is recognized by near-cognate suppressor tRNA that allows translation to proceed and terminate at the next stop codon [92]. In many ssRNA viruses belonging to Luteovirus (Luteoviridae family), Alphavirus (Togaviridae family) and Tobamovirus (Virgaviridae family), programmed readthrough takes place, resulting in a C-terminal extension of the initial protein. This extension often encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or an extension to the coat protein [94\u201396]. Like programmed frameshifting, the efficiency of programmed readthrough is also modulated by features located in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end of the suppressed stop codon, such as adenosine residues in the region immediately 5\u2032 of the stop codon [97]. However, it is the presence of many sequence and structural features in the 3\u2032-end of the stop codon that stimulates and enhances the readthrough efficiency. These signatures fall into three major classes, group I, II and III, out of which viral readthrough signals belonging to group II and III contain an RNA secondary structural element [96]. In type I motifs, readthrough across a UAG codon is stimulated by a six nucleotide motif having a consensus sequence of UAG_CAR_YYA (R = purine, Y = pyrimidine) and are mainly present in tobamoviruses to allow translation of polymerase [98, 99]. Type II motifs consist of a UGA stop codon followed by CGG or CUA and an extended stem\u2013loop structure \u223c8 nucleotides downstream [100]. Type III motifs consist of a UAG stop codon and purine-rich octanucleotide spacer sequence followed by an RNA structure that has been found to be an RNA pseudoknot in cases of gammaretroviruses [98, 101]. Apart from these classes, a novel type of readthrough signature in RNA viruses was identified recently in ORF5 of potato leafroll virus (Luteoviride family), which consisted of a C-rich region in the vicinity of coat protein stop codon and a distal RNA stem\u2013loop structure ~640 nucleotides downstream of this \u2018leaky\u2019 stop codon. The presence of stem\u2013loop structure was validated by SHAPE [102] and was found to be essential for readthrough protein translation.",

The approach identified a phylogenetically conserved stem\u2013loop structure [100] in alphaviruses, which was later verified experimentally by chemical probing [105]. The stem\u2013loop was found to have 10\u201312 base pairs with a 1 nucleotide asymmetric bulge [100]. The presence of a classical H-type RNA pseudoknot in the 3\u2032 region of the readthrough signal of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and other retroviruses was also verified by chemical probing and computational studies that identified loop and stem regions, which were critical in stimulating the efficiency of readthrough [101, 106, 107]. RNA-folding algorithms further constituted a powerful and reliable tool to screen sequences from plant RNA viruses belonging to Virgaviridae family and were found to harbor potential phylogenetically conserved stem\u2013loop structures involved in readthrough stimulation [100]. These RNA structures have been proposed to modulate readthrough in a number of possible ways that involve interference with release factors binding or unwinding by ribosomal helicases or by pausing the ribosome in a way akin to frameshift inducing pseudoknots [105].",

It has been found that codons like ACG, CUG, AUU, AUA, AUC, etc. can initiate translation at \u223c2\u201330% of the levels obtained with an AUG start codon [110]. Initiation at a non-AUG codon depends strongly on the sequence context (A/G at \u22123 and a G at +4). This is significantly stimulated by the presence of an RNA structure that forms nearly 14 residues downstream of this codon [111] (Figure 1). This spacing appropriately positions the tertiary structure at the mRNA entry tunnel of the ribosome so that the potential non-AUG codon lies at the P-site of ribosome, while the ribosome is paused at the base of structure and unwinds it. Because of the relative inefficiency of a non-AUG codon initiation, some ribosomes eventually slide past this site until they encounter a cognate AUG or near-cognate codon.",

This is then followed by release of 60S subunit, aided by several release factors (eRF1 and eRF3, eRF1 being responsible for codon recognition). The dissociation of 60S subunit leaves a 40S/deacylated tRNA still bound to mRNA, which is dissociated following a sequence of events. However, in certain incidences, the 40S subunit remains associated within the message and reinitiates translation at a downstream AUG codon [114] (Figure 1). This happens when translation has terminated at very short (usually <30 codons) ORFs that can give rise to 40S subunits capable of scanning and reinitiating translation at a downstream AUG codon [115]. The chances of reinitiation depend on the length of upstream ORF and distance between the termination codon of this ORF and start codon of downstream ORF [116, 117]. Termination of translation of the upstream ORF is a mandatory requirement in order to distinguish this process from internal translation initiation by IRES.",

They enhance translation by recruiting multiple initiation factors or ribosomal subunits at 3\u2032-end, to form a complex, which is subsequently brought near 5\u2032-end to initiate translation [119]. Due to high structural diversity among different 3\u2032-CITE structures, they have been classified into seven different classes on the basis of their structural features, types of initiation factors recruited and mode of interacting with the 5\u2032-end. These aspects have been covered in a comprehensive way in recent review [120]. The high structural variability makes the bioinformatics prediction of 3\u2032-CITEs extremely difficult. Furthermore, like RNA structures in shunting, the absence of experimental structural data from biophysical methods is a great hindrance in studying the conformational dynamics and folding landscape of these structures.

            "text": "In some plant RNA viruses under certain conditions, the majority of ribosomes do not initiate translation at the first AUG codon but continue scanning until they reach an alternative downstream start codon [123], in a process called leaky scanning. The efficiency of leaky scanning has been reported to depend on a sub-optimal sequence context of the initiator methionine AUG codon (defined from +1 to +3) defined by absence of a G at +4 and A/G at \u22123 position. Presence of these residues constitutes an optimal sequence context for canonical translation initiation to take place [124]. Leaky scanning can be stimulated when the AUG codon is located very close to 5\u2032-end of the UTR, particularly when the length of UTR is <15 nucleotides [125]. When the two AUG codons are located in close vicinity to each other (<6 nt separation), the potential for leaky scanning increases [126]. As an example, in segment 6 of influenza virus B, leaky scanning involves alternating forward and backward movements about a downstream AUG codon that allows capturing of a proportion of scanning ribosomes in order to stack them in a position appropriate for initiating translation at the preceding AUG codon [127]. In vitro expression studies in plant plum pox virus (genus Potyvirus) have revealed that leaky scanning mainly depends on presence of initiator codons located in an optimal sequence context, and no RNA secondary structure has been found to regulate or stimulate the process. While programs like TITER [128] have been developed to predict alternative translation initiation sites (TISs) in mammalian genomes, no such dedicated tools are available for predicting alternative TISs in viral genomes.",

            "text": "Apart from IRES and ribosomal frameshifting, the current knowledge on the tertiary structural organization of RNA structures involved in ribosomal shunting, reinitiation and non-AUG initiation is acutely limited. This creates a large vacuum in the current understanding of RNA structure\u2013function relationship as well as mechanisms by which these structures engage and recruit ribosome and various translation factors. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of whole-genome studies like Frag-Seq and PARS, accompanied by empirical structural modeling tools to come up with an accurate model of IRES elements [129] in Picornaviridae [37, 130]. Studies of a similar magnitude are still required for investigating the structures involved in \u22121/+1/\u22122/+2 ribosomal frameshift, stop-codon readthrough, shunting and reinitiation. Although getting a secondary structure map of entire genomes from high-throughput sequencing is now a routine process, inferring the long-range tertiary interactions from secondary structure components still remains a challenging task. Moreover, even the large-scale viral genomic maps, yielded by chemical probing data such as SHAPE, provide an incomplete picture, since protein induced dynamic structural changes are not taken into account in these analyses [131]. Recent approaches combining chemical probing with simultaneous native gel electrophoresis (in-gel SHAPE [132]) and high-throughput sequencing [133], ribosome profiling, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and viral deep sequencing [134] have paved the way for developing deep-learning algorithms, capable of identifying sequence motifs and have provided fresh insights into the local, highly variable conformations of 5\u2032-/3\u2032-UTRs and coding regions [135]. Of the recent techniques developed to study RNA structures in vivo/in vitro in a high-throughput way, SHAPE technique has been tweaked extensively to generate different variants suitable for specific purposes, e.g. SHAPE-Map, SHAPE-Seq and aiSHAPE [133, 136]. Mod-Seq is another pipeline developed to study the in vivo and in vitro structures of long RNAs, e.g. ribosomes that have been combined with deep sequencing [137]. More recently, a state-of-the-art technique called LASER-Seq [138] has been developed to probe structures directly in cells, which exploits conformation-related parameters like solvent accessibility. A recent in vivo analysis of RNA conformational dynamics in Zika virus [139] has revealed the vast and fluid conformational landscape of entire RNA genomes. The observations from these studies combined with state-of-the-art computational RNA-folding algorithms could provide a stepping stone to predict RNA tertiary structure folding and long-range interactions that could vastly improve our current understanding of the mechanism by which various RNA structures modulate translation in viruses. There has been a steady rise in the development of bioinformatics pipelines along with aforementioned high-throughput structure probing algorithms; a few, but in no way comprehensive, examples being Mod-Seeker [137], StructureFold [140] and dStruct [141], along with excellent reviews describing these and other pipelines [142, 143].",

With increasing instances of such mechanisms being identified in yeast and mammals, efforts have redirected towards exploiting features of these mechanisms towards biotechnological and biomedical purposes. The ability to recruit the ribosome at an internal location, independently of cap-recognition and 5\u2032-UTR scanning events, by IRES structures has serious biotechnological implications. The IRES elements have been used for expression of synthetic bi-cistronic [144] and multi-cistronic [145] constructs to express proteins of desire in a number of experimental setups. However, the lack of any global sequence conservation across different viral families poses technical challenges in designing effective sequence constructs for in vitro experiments. Recent computational studies employing RNA inverse-folding methods, which involve designing a sequence capable of assuming a desired reference structure, have proved to be valuable tools in de novo IRES predictions [146]. Algorithms developed for inverse folding are being developed, keeping specific scientific goals in perspective. They range mostly from heuristic methods, which focus on providing optimal sequence sets using user-specified constraints iteratively until a desired target structure is achieved [147], to probabilistic approaches like INFO-RNA [148] and methods employing statistical mechanical sampling schemes, reviewed in [149]. In addition to sequence limitations, the paucity of available structural information on a full-length, ribosome-free and bound IRES elements presents another technical challenge for studying the conformational dynamics and folding landscapes as well as in setting up simulation and homology modeling studies.",

(A) IRES: an extensive RNA structure in 5\u2032-UTR composed of many hairpin stems recruits 40S ribosome and other translation factors. These factors assemble at the structure and scan the mRNA for the nearest AUG codon to start translation. (B) \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting: an RNA pseudoknot or a stem\u2013loop present in the overlapping genomic region stalls the actively translating ribosome and induces a shift in the reading register, so that downstream translation can be resumed from a new reading frame. (C) Ribosomal shunting: an extensive RNA structure located between a short and a long ORF shunts the 40S subunit of the ribosome between the two ORFs. (D) Stop codon readthrough: RNA structure that is located between two ORFs prevents the reading of the cognate stop codon and releases factor binding so that translation can be continued. (E,F) Reinitiation and non-AUG initiation: in reinitiation, upstream sequence motifs [termination upstream ribosome binding site (TURBS)] interact with 40S subunit to reinitiate translation. In non-AUG initiation, the RNA sequence and/or structure stimulates reading of a near-cognate start codon by the ribosome.",
