Survival rates vary significantly by etiology and have improved to around 60% overall without LT and over 85% with LT [3] . Improvement of survival rates over recent decades is related to improved critical care management, better prognostic assessment, and the timely prioritization of patients for LT. The management of ALF is focused on support of all organ systems and the prevention and treatment of complications, particularly sepsis. Liver necrosis acts as a focus of inflammation, driving vasoplegia and leading to cardiovascular collapse, which exacerbates dysfunction of other vital organs, particularly the kidney and brain. The identification and treatment of the cause of the underlying liver injury should be the primary goal, with a concurrent focus on the optimization of the circulation to promote hepatocellular regeneration and to prevent further insult due to ischemic injury. However, despite such endeavors timely recognition that hepatic regeneration will ultimately not be sufficient is crucial. Under these circumstances, Liver transplantation with removal of the necrotic liver mass offers the best chance of survival. The decision to prioritize for transplantation requires a multidisciplinary team approach incorporating specialist liver transplant surgeons, hepatologists, and intensivists who can utilize established prognostic criteria along with the daily assessment of the levels of organ support to best determine which patients are likely to benefit from being listed for transplant with high priority and indeed proceeding to OLT if levels of organ support permit ( Fig. 3. 2) [4] .",

Patients with ALF must fulfill a strict set of selection criteria based on published risk factors for prioritization before being listed on the national super-urgent transplantation waiting list (Table 3 .1). These patients are then stratified by blood group and time while on the super-urgent waiting list. In most cases a donor organ should be available within 48-72 h. Occasionally an ABO incompatible donor organ needs to be considered in light of the unavailability of an ABO compatible organ weighed against the projected deterioration of the clinical condition. The currently available selection criteria are imperfect and when coupled with improving transplant free survival rates, particularly for acetominophen overdose [5] , the decision of who and when to transplant is complex. There is emerging support for delaying transplant if the clinical situation is improving in patients with a favorable etiology [6] . The option of an auxiliary transplant graft is sometimes considered as it allows native regeneration and withdrawal of immunosuppression, but due to the increased risk of early postoperative complications it necessitates careful scrutiny of appropriate potential candidates.",

The two most common definitions concentrate on the time period from jaundice to the onset of encephalopathy [1] . This classification is important, because the hyperacute forms of ALF including acetominophen overdose and Hepatitis A are associated with mortality due to cerebral edema and kidney injury. However, survival without transplantation for this group is superior compared to more indolent subacute causes, including sero-negative and idiosyncratic drug reactions ( Fig. 3. 2) [4, 3] . These etiologies are not as frequently complicated by the cerebral and renal insults, but carry a higher mortality burden compared to hyperacute causes (Table 3 .1) [2] (Fig. 1.3) . ",

In 1998 the Medicine Control Agency in the UK sought to limit the availability of paracetamol. Legislation was changed in line with World Health Organization recommendations and data from other countries with similar restrictive policies that had lower rates of paracetamol-induced hepatoxicity. Suicidal or para-suicidal actions are usually impulsive acts in reaction to crises; therefore, it was postulated that [4] limiting supply would result in reduced availability of paracetamol, thus reducing the quantity ingested and lowering rates of hepatoxicity. The general sale of paracetamol was restricted to sixteen 500 mg tablets, a total of 8 g per packet. Reports suggested that this was a successful policy that resulted in a reduction of intensive care admissions and of deaths from POD by 43% in the years following the legislation [8] , despite some debate on the true mortality benefit of pack size reduction alone [9] .",

Studies assessing the rate of deliberate versus accidental POD display geographic variation. In Europe, studies have reported around 86% of POD cases were deliberate and 14% were accidental [11] , while US poisons center data have reported rates of 35% and 65%, respectively [12] . Paracetamol medications combined with narcotics pose a potential for unintentional hepatoxicity when addiction to the narcotic within such combined analgesics leads to a gradual increase of the ingested dose [13] . This may be a significant reason for the discrepancy between the US and the UK with regard to deliberate and unintentional overdose.

The majority of nonparacetamol DILI cases are idiosyncratic reactions that occur in around 1 in 10,000 of exposed patients. More than 1000 drugs and herbal remedies have been implicated and idiosyncratic reactions comprise 10% of ALF cases [19] . Idiosyncratic DILI is a complex phenomenon that appears to be closely related to how cell mitochondria balance cellular injury and regeneration. The reactions are idiosyncratic as liver injury is unpredictable and not dose-dependant. There are non-allergic and allergic idiosyncratic DILI, the latter characterized by fever, skin reactions, eosinophilia with the formation of autoantibodies (for example drug-related eosinophilic syndrome-DRESS). Several risk factors for DILI have been identified and include age, female gender, concomitant diseases, and specific drugs. DILI algorithms and clinical scales may improve consistency and aid the clinicians to determine the causality of adverse drug reactions [20] .",

A literature review in 2005 cited 34 cases of primary and metastatic neoplastic infiltration of the liver resulting in ALF [21] . The pathophysiology of ALF in neoplastic infiltration is multifactorial. Parenchymal ischemia and infarction can be caused by diffuse tumor cell infiltration or vascular occlusion from tumor thrombi. It has also been postulated that diffuse tumor cell infiltration renders the remaining liver parenchyma highly susceptible to ischemic injury. A case series of three patients with metastatic disease demonstrated biopsy-proven hepatic ischemia in the absence of any discernible episodes of systemic hypotension [21, 22] . Additionally, cytokinemediated liver injury has been implicated in lymphomatous infiltration [23] . Clinical suspicion and features suggestive of malignancy such as hepatomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes on physical examination along with computer tomography (CT) findings suggestive of an infiltrative process should prompt an attempt to obtain a biopsy for a definitive histological diagnosis. Radiological imaging including both ultrasonography and triple phase computer tomography should not solely be relied on due to their poor sensitivity for metastatic and lymphomatous infiltration of the liver. There are no specific biomarkers for tumour infiltration; elevations of ALT and AST with tumors are usually lower that than with ischemic hepatitis. Both appear to have greater sensitivity in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia. However, jaundice does not always manifest in the setting of tumor infiltration and cases with over 90% liver infiltration without jaundice have been reported. A transjugular liver, bone marrow aspiration, and trephine (bone marrow) or lymph node biopsy can be invaluable tools for establishing a diagnosis. Confirmed malignancy is a absolute contraindication for liver transplantation, establishing a diagnosis is therefore crucial.",

The incidence of WD is approximately 1 in 30,000 and can present acutely, usually in pediatric or young female patients, or chronically in adults sometimes into their eighth decade of life. ALF in WD is unique as there is usually some preexisting liver disease at the time when ALF ensues. WD is diagnosed by measuring indices of copper metabolism, although in ALF these investigations can be misleadingly normal. Serum copper and caeruloplasmin, as an acute phase protein, can both be normal or elevated in other causes of ALF. Elevated levels of urinary copper are a good indicator of WD, but the high incidence of anuric acute kidney injury in ALF may eliminate this diagnostic tool. Ophthalmic exam of corneas can be useful to detect the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which in combination with liver disease and copper metabolism abnormalities strongly supports the diagnosis. Additionally, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and low serum cholinesterase levels can be a feature of WD [26] .

Laboratory investigations should include hepatitis and atypical viral serology; autoantibodies (antinuclear, anti-smooth muscle, anti-liver kidney microsomal, anti-soluble liver antigen and anti-mitochondrial antibodies), paracetamol levels and urine and serum copper levels. A negative paracetamol level does not rule out paracetamol as a cause of ALF. Additionally ultrasonography of the liver and its vasculature should be performed as we as axial imaging with computer tomography if the history and laboratory investigations do not confirm viral or druginduced insults. The outcome is largely determined by the severity of the underlying liver insult and the development of organ failure; any episodes of sepsis have a further strong impact on mortality. (Table 3 .1) Early recognition and treatment of sepsis and the prevention and support of organ dysfunction is therefore key to gain time for hepatic regeneration. Finally, a timely decision for super-urgent liver transplantation is required when it becomes sufficiently clear that hepatic regeneration will not occur in time. This decision carries particular importance given that the median time from listing to transplantation is around 48 h in the UK. 24% of patients who are listed will never receive a transplant; the majority (92%) of these patients will die while waiting for an organ and the remainder will become \"too sick\" for transplantation [29] . Several pre-transplant factors have been associated with poor outcomes after LT for ALF such as age >45-50 years, escalating vasopressor requirements, the use of high-risk organs and ABO-incompatibility [29, 30] . Other factors should also prompt a discussion about the suitability for transplantation include fixed dilated pupils for greater than 2 h, necrotizing pancreatitis, severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, culture proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring more than 24 h of antimicrobial therapy before transplantation. All these conditions need to be evaluated in relation to age and the degree of associated organ failures. The complex nature of ALF requires the involvement of wide spectrum of expertise to form a cohesive multidisciplinary team. Critical care nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, transplant surgeons, hepatologists and liver intensivists should all be included in this team.",

Some commonly used resuscitation parameters may be problematic in ALF; for example ScvO 2 is often significantly elevated reflecting the hyperdynamic circulation and microvascular shunting. Lactate concentrations in ALF may reflect sole circulatory disarray but also impaired hepatic clearance of lactate especially if adequate volume resuscitation has been implemented. Hyperlactatemia reflects liver, circulatory and cellular dysfunction; however the liver has a large reserve for lactate metabolism. Even after hepatectomy with resection of more than 50% of the liver lactate levels may remain normal [32] . High lactate levels are therefore frequently encountered in ALF where inadequate fluid resuscitation has lead to circulatory and cellular metabolism dysfunction. In general hyperlactatemia and the speed of its resolution acts as an important predictor of outcome in both critical illness and ALF [33] . Lactate is now recognized as an important prognostic variable. Persistently elevated lactate levels >3.0 mmol/L despite aggressive fluid resuscitation [34] have been incorporated into the Kings College Criteria (KCC) adding statistical strength to the original O'Grady criteria [35] .",

The diagnosis and treatment of critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) was first encountered in sepsis with the demonstration that low dose hydrocortisone could accelerate the reversal of shock, but no significant effect on mortality [38] . The high prevalence of CIRCI in ALF can be explained by factors that affect cortisol production and metabolism. Firstly, both ALF and sepsis often coexist and ALF represents an additional stress that can lead to RAI. Secondly, patients with ALF have low circulating cortisol levels for several reasons: the effects of low levels of HDL cholesterol that is central to cortisol production, increased conversion of cortisol to the inactive form cortisone and the negative effect of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) on hypothalamic function all contribute to the low circulating TC levels [39] .",

This is mostly related to the decrease of both albumin and cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), that leads to an increase of free cortisol (FC) levels, despite low measured total cortisol (TC) levels. Various alternative measures or calculations have been explored to better assess FC levels. Salivary cortisol levels correlate well with FC although in ventilated patients this may be difficult to obtain. Alternatively, the free cortisol index (see equation below) that be calculated by measuring both CBG and TC levels correlates well with FC levels [41] . These alternative measures of FC may prove to be better methods of assessing RAI rather than relying on TC levels alone. However, hydrocortisone therapy is frequently initiated empirically to impact on escalating vasopressor levels.",

A significant number of patients will also develop respiratory complications. ARDS complicates up to 30% of paracetamol-induced ALF cases [43] . It affects primarily those with significant vasopressor requirements and evidence of intracranial hypertension (ICH). The mechanisms of lung injury in ALF include the directly toxic effects of acetominophen and the release of vasoactive mediators that affect not only the brain and circulation but also the lungs causing an increased vascular permeability and capillary leak. This is further exacerbated by fluid accumulation within the extravascular compartments as a result of large volumes of fluid administration to support a vasoplegic circulation. Additionally, there is a high incidence (around 51%) of gram-negative organisms isolated from tracheal aspirates in intubated ALF patients [44] , that directly impact the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The management of ICH increases the risk of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sepsis and ARDS as adequate sedation and specific measures to avoid hyperthermia contribute to limited tracheobronchial toilet and retention of secretions. Endotracheal tubes with a large volume, low pressure cuffs and a subglottic suction port may help to mitigate some of the VAP risks. Other respiratory complications associated with both mechanical ventilation and critical illness have been described in patients with ALF. These include pleural effusions, atelectasis, and poor compliance due to raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) or reduced thoracic compliance due to chest wall edema.",

A balanced approach is often required, though low tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg) can achieve normal partial pressures of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) in most cases. Increased IAP and decreased lung compliance due to chest wall edema lead to increases in pleural pressure, rendering the plateau pressure a poor measure of transpulmonary pressure. Therefore, attempts to limit plateau pressure below 30 cm water can be difficult to attain and indeed are often unnecessary. The combination of ARDS with severely elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) with intact physiological autoregulation requires tight control of PaCO 2 . When all conventional measures to optimize ventilation have been exhausted, extracorporeal devices can be considered but should be a strategy of last resort due the significant potential for bleeding complications associated with cannulae insertion and limb ischemia. Such devices have been used successfully in traumatic brain injury and ARDS [45] and have also been employed on few occasions in ALF patients associated with ARDS, when management of ICH has remained problematic [46] .",

The adverse effect of high PEEP on ICH may be outweighed by the improvement of oxygenation and consequent improvement of cerebral blood flow. Recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning are usually contraindicated due to the impact on ICH. Refractory hypoxemia may be a reason to consider removing patients with ALF from the transplant waiting list. However, hypoxemia alone appears to be a nonspecific variable in the diagnosis of ARDS. Furthermore, a low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to FiO 2 ratio is common, often transient and not necessarily associated with poor outcomes [47] .

The return of ICP autoregulation permits a more sustained withdrawal of sedation and weaning from mandatory modes of ventilation. However, once sedation is decreased or stopped neurological problems may arise such as slow emergence from sedation or critical care delirium. Critical illness acquired weakness is highly prevalent, due to the significant number of risk factors for this condition encountered in ALF, including sepsis, profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), exposure to steroids, high protein catabolism and multi-organ failure [49] .

ALF is also associated with impaired peripheral uptake of glucose and [57] . It is important to establish and maintain normoglycaemia early for example with infusions of 20-50% dextrose until enteral nutrition is commenced. Tight blood glucose control has been controversial since the landmark study by Van Den Berghe in 2001 and subsequent studies demonstrated more adverse effects and poorer outcome with hyperglycemia in critically ill patients. This was also demonstrated in patients with neurovascular brain injury and in ALF where hyperglycemia can contribute to poor ICH control [58] . However, meta-analyses assessing tight glycemic control studies since 2001 have not confirmed the mortality benefit demonstrated in the original study population but instead an increased rate of hypoglycemic episodes with intensive insulin regimens. Ultimately, a balanced approach is required with the goal of achieving blood glucose levels closer to the lower limit of 6-8 mmol/L (108-145 mg/dL) avoiding hypoglycemia and elevated levels greater than 12 mmol/L (216 mg/dL).",

The use of opioid-based sedation, aggressive fluid regimens causing bowel wall edema, raised intra-abdominal pressure and constipation all contribute to abnormalities of gut motility resulting in decreased absorption. If gut failure and poor absorption persist despite attention to constipation therapy and the use of prokinetics early intervention with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be a last resort. Previous concerns about TPN-induced liver toxicity are not observed with newer hypocaloric regimens [59] . Normal protein intake of approximately 1 g/kg/day does not seem to worsen hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. This is important, because ALF patients are often catabolic with supra-normal energy expenditure despite significant hepatocyte loss. Furthermore, there is significant protein catabolism with muscle wasting, amino acid losses, and vitamin deficiency, that can affect immune function. Therefore supplementation of multiple vitamins and trace elements in patients with ALF is necessary, especially in patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) regimen [60, 61] . Hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered with CRRT, especially high volume dialysis and requires prompt replacement. However, hypophosphatemia may also herald liver regeneration with increased hepatic ATP production and is considered as a good prognostic marker [62] .",

If drug level monitoring is not possible, antibiotic dosing should aim for higher drug levels because of the immuneparesis associated with ALF. The innate immune system undergoes significant changes in response to acute liver injury and has a central role in the subsequent development of the clinical manifestations of ALF. Many of these changes closely resemble the features of systemic sepsis that results in vasoplegic circulation and MOF. The complex immune responses in ALF are closely related to some of the clinical complications of ALF, particularly, particularly bacteremia and encephalopathy. The innate immune system is initially activated with the mobilization of immune cellular components, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. These cells are involved in the profound release of cytokines as part of the proand anti-inflammatory responses to sustained liver injury together with significant decrease of complement factors impairing opsonisation of bacteria [67] . Neutrophil function is impaired with reduced chemotaxis, bacteriocidal activity, and decreased production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Both monocytes and macrophages are involved in initiation, propagation, and resolution of acute liver injury. Shortly after acute liver injury macrophages release chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This proinflammatory state is balanced by anti-inflammatory responses that accompany the recruitment of monocytes to the site of the liver injury to initiate repair processes. Activated macrophages release TNF-a, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates, and lysosomal enzymes. These elevations of TNF correlate with the development of sepsis and increased IL-6 levels are associated with MOF and mortality (Fig. 3.3) . High-volume plasma exchange (HVP) was recently studied in a randomized controlled trial. Patients with acute liver failure were randomized to either three cycles of HVP or standard medical therapy. HVP increased overall transplant-free survival with the largest effect on survival in patients who did not receive LT [68] . In this trial HVP was associated with significant reduction in circulating damage associated molecular pattern molecules and TNF-alpha, suggesting that HVP acts in part by controlling the innate immune response.",

Furthermore glutathione, an important element in the detoxification of acetaminophen and its metabolites has paradoxically also been implicated in the formation of glutathione conjugates that are considered nephrotoxic. AKI in patients with ALF frequently requires the use of CRRT for renal-specific and non-renalrelated reasons. ALF complicates the use of CRRT specifically when anticoagulation is required to extend filter life span. Despite the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia associated AKI in Acute Liver failure Glomerular disease with ALF, CRRT circuits can clot as a result of losses of both pro-and anticoagulation factors [75] . Good vascular access, use of pre-dilution fluid replacement, high blood flows to reduce the ultrafiltration fraction, prompt attention to alarms and the use of prostacyclin anticoagulation may extend filter life. Prostacyclin has a half-life of seconds and therefore represents a safe anticoagulant in ALF in the absence of hemorrhage. Routine use of heparin for filter anticoagulation is not recommended and citrate anticoagulation is complicated by the risk of citrate toxicity, due to the integral role of the liver in citrate metabolism. However, the use of citrate-based intraoperative dialysis during a liver transplantation for a paracetamol-induced ALF patient and AKI with no signs of citrate toxicity has been reported [76] . The lack of toxicity was likely due to a low dose of citrate (0.8 mmol/L; only about one-fifth of the concentration necessary to achieve anticoagulation) and the predominant role of muscle metabolizing citrate. Citrate dialysate for RRT in ALF should if at all only used for short periods and is not a common practice. Indications and timing of initiation, dose, anticoagulation and continuous versus intermittent CRRT remain controversial. The Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) study showed no mortality benefit of high ultrafiltration doses of 35-40 mL/kg/h compared to low rates of 20-25 mL/kg/h of CRRT in critically ill patients [77] . This has been confirmed by the IVOIRE (hIgh VOlume in Intensive Care) study in patients with septic shock (comparing 70 mL/kg/h with 35 mL/kg/h) and a subsequent meta-analyses [78] [79] [80] .

A PT increasing on day 4 after ingestion with a peak PT of greater than 180 s is predictive of a 65% mortality [82] . Prolonged PT however does not predict bleeding risk in ALF and thrombin generation tests may be a better reflection of coagulation status [83] . ALF impairs synthesis of pro-and anticoagulant factors and therefore ALF patients can develop hypercoagulable states as well as bleeding diathesis [84] . The use of blood products containing clotting factors will affect the utility of PT as a predictive marker. Blood products to correct coagulopathy should only be used when there is active bleeding or an invasive procedure such as ICP bolt insertion is to be undertaken.",

The King's College criteria (KCC: INR, hepatic encephalopathy, acidosis, serum creatinine and lactate) have become the most widely used criteria for assessing prognosis in ALF. The KCC have a high specificity for mortality without transplantation but a low sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV). Quality of life is significantly affected by transplantation and should be included as an aspect of the decision-making process especially for those patients with POD, who may also have chronic psychiatric conditions.

An early initial assessment of prognosis must be individualized in the context of existing validated criteria and continuously reviewed during the hospitalization.

Early referral to a specialist liver center with the option of liver transplantation and an experienced multidisciplinary team is recommended. (Table 3 and anesthesiologists, hepatologists, nurses and physiotherapists all working to ensure a high standard of care is delivered. Furthermore, a good understanding of the poor prognostic variables is necessary to determine those most at risk of developing ALF to facilitate timely and safe transfer. The initial primary goal of management is to establish a diagnosis to facilitate the initiation of therapies that may prevent further liver injury. Additionally, optimization of the circulation with both appropriate early invasive monitoring directing aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support and assessment for high-volume plasma exchange is the key. The early use of empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents along with strict infection control measures are necessary. Due to the high frequency of sepsis without SIRS symptoms a low threshold for obtaining cultures and broadening antibiotic coverage is required when the clinical condition deteriorates. A keen awareness of the potential for raised ICH, particularly in the young, necessitates appropriate monitoring and management, which will be discussed in detail in a separate chapter. In parallel with supportive measures an assessment of the clinical history and prognostic variables must be undertaken to determine, which patient fulfills national transplantation criteria. The decision to list a patient for superurgent liver transplantation is often difficult and can be affected by age, co-morbidities, the dynamics of the clinical condition and psychosocial factors. [6] The clinical course for those not transplanted is often precarious and associated with a high mortality [5] . Outcome is affected by the speed and degree of hepatic regeneration and the impact of the cumulative insults such as sepsis, AKI requiring prolonged RRT, and critical illness associated weakness that may result in extended periods of rehabilitation in those that survive. Patients who proceed to transplantation and receive a good functioning graft often experience swift resolution of the circulatory and neurovascular disarray and have significantly improved outcomes albeit offset by the long-term impact of lifelong immunosuppression.",
