For reasons that are not completely understood, the per-capita mortality from COVID-19 varies by several orders of magnitude between countries. 1 Numerous sources of heterogeneity have been hypothesized. Higher mortality has been observed in older populations and in men. 2, 3 Patient-level behaviors, such as smoking, might also have an impact. 3 Other potentially relevant factors include economic activity, and environmental variation, such as temperature. 4 More urban settings and increased population density would be expected to enhance viral transmission. 5 In addition, public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic may influence per-capita mortality. Various strategies have been implemented, ranging from robust testing programs to lockdown or stay-at-home orders, to mandates regarding social distancing and face mask usage. Practices with theoretical benefit, such as social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and implementation of mandates regarding use of masks in public spaces, must be assessed quickly, as implementation has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality.",

One recent meta-analysis of 10 trials in families, students, or religious pilgrims found that the relative risk for influenza with the use of face masks was 0.78, a 22% reduction, though the findings were not statistically significant. 48 Combining all the trials, there were 29 cases in groups assigned to wear masks, compared with 51 cases in control groups. 48 The direct applicability of these results to mask-wearing at the population level is uncertain. For instance, there was some heterogeneity in methods of the component trials, with one trial assigning mask wearing to the person with a respiratory illness, another to his close contacts, and the remainder to both the ill and their contacts. 48 Mask-wearing was inconsistent. The groups living together could not wear a mask when bathing, sleeping, eating, or brushing teeth. [49] [50] [51] In one of the studies reviewed, parents wore a mask during the day, but not at night when sleeping next to their sick child. 51 In a different trial, students were asked to wear a mask in their residence hall for at least 6 hours daily (rather than all the time). 49 The bottom line is that it is nearly impossible for people to constantly maintain mask wear around the people with whom they live. In contrast, wearing a mask when on public transit or shopping is quite feasible. In addition, as an infection propagates through multiple generations in the population, the benefits multiply exponentially. Even if one accepts that masks would only reduce transmissions by 22%, then after 10 cycles of the infection, mask-wearing would reduce the level of infection in the population by 91.7%, as compared with a non-mask wearing population (because 0.78 10 = 0.083).

We previously identified just 3 countries (Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, and the UAE) which had performed over 75,000 tests per million population by April 16, and all 3 had mortality below 1 in 46,000 at that point. 53 By May 9, we could add to this \"high-testing\" group, the Falkland Islands and Bahrain, as all 5 countries had tested over one tenth of their population. All 5 countries had a mortality of 29 per million (1 in 34,480 people) or less. The degree to which these results would apply to larger, less isolated, or less wealthy countries is unknown. Statistical support for benefit of high levels of testing might be demonstrated if additional and more diverse countries are able to test at this level.",
