            "text": "As an ecosystem service, pollination was estimated to be worth \u20ac153 billion in 2005 (Gallai et al., 2009). Bees (Hymenoptera), hoverflies and other anthophilous flies (Diptera), butterflies (Lepidoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) are the main pollinators in temperate regions (Kevan & Baker, 1983; Vanbergen & The Insect Pollinators Initiative, 2013; Rader et al., 2016). Many studies have shown that the abundance and species richness of pollinators has decreased over the past 50 years, and that the ecological homogenisation of bee and butterfly communities has increased (Biesmeijer et al., 2006; Carvalheiro et al., 2013). These studies have highlighted land\u2010use changes that destroy, fragment and degrade habitats as one of the main causes of this decline in pollinators (Goulson et al., 2005; Stokstad, 2006; Potts et al., 2010). Although many studies have examined the effects of fragmentation on bees and butterflies (Cane, 2001; Maes & Van Dyck, 2001; Van Dyck et al., 2009; Winfree et al., 2009; Hadley & Betts, 2011), few studies have examined the effects on hoverfly communities, and these studies have produced limited, often contradictory, results (Biesmeijer et al., 2006; Keil et al., 2011; Carvalheiro et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Adult hoverflies (Diptera, Syrphidae) depend on floral resources, that is, pollen and nectar. Pollen is consumed mainly by females to provide nutrients (proteins, sterols) for egg production, and nectar is mainly consumed by males and females to provide energy (sugars) for flight while searching for partners (Haslett, 1989; Woodcock et al., 2014). Hoverflies are pollinators or co\u2010pollinators of many plant species (Larson et al., 2001; Inouye et al., 2015). Although there appears to be little specialisation at the species level, individuals can be highly flower constant over short time scales (Branquart & Hemptinne, 2000). Their degree of specialisation is linked to distinct morphological traits. For example, large\u2010body species with a short proboscis are limited to flowers that produce unconcealed nectar, such as several species of the Rosaceae or Apiaceae family. By contrast, ubiquitous hoverfly species generally have a small body with a long proboscis (Gilbert, 1981, 1986; Branquart & Hemptinne, 2000).",

            "text": "Hoverfly larvae have extremely diverse diets. Some species are saprophagous, feeding on decaying plant or animal matter and thereby helping to decompose waste. Other species are insectivorous (aphids, thrips, etc.) and provide biological pest control, especially in agricultural landscapes. A number of these species are migrants that exploit local fluctuations in aphid abundance (Stubbs & Falk, 1983). Some species are phytophagous or mycophagous (Ball & Morris, 2015; Speight et al., 2015). Their diets, therefore, restrict each species to specific microhabitats (identifiable structural features used by hoverfly larvae such as plant debris, foliage or cow dung) during larval development. Their restricted microhabitats allow hoverflies to be used as biological indicators to evaluate the state of conservation of a specific ecosystem (Sommaggio, 1999; Speight et al., 2000; Burgio & Sommaggio, 2007).",

            "text": "Ecological and morphological traits of hoverflies could influence their responses to landscape composition and resource availability. For example, several studies have shown that fragmentation affects species differently depending on their level of specialisation and ability to disperse (Schweiger et al., 2007). Nevertheless, community analyses supported by ecological and morphological data are infrequent in animal ecology, mainly due to a lack of information at the community level. The Syrph the Net database (Speight et al., 2015), which contains data on the ecological traits of hoverfly species, has facilitated community\u2010level analyses for hoverflies. To analyse the responses of hoverfly communities to environmental conditions, studies group species with similar ecological traits (Branquart & Hemptinne, 2000; Ouin et al., 2006; Schweiger et al., 2007). Most studies separate hoverfly groups by ecological traits such as larval diet, larval microhabitat or adult body size (Dziock, 2006; Schweiger et al., 2007; Keil et al., 2008), or a combination of larval and adult traits (Ouin et al., 2006).",

For example, larvae of Scaeva selenitica grow under closed\u2010canopy conditions, whereas adults need open biotopes rich in floral resources (Gittings et al., 2006). Thus, the composition of the landscape matrix matters at the landscape scale (Kleijn & Van Langevelde, 2006; Meyer et al., 2009; \u00d6ckinger et al., 2012). Furthermore, dispersal capability influences the spatial scale at which individuals perceive their environment. Species of hoverflies vary in their dispersal capability from a few metres to 2 km per day (Sch\u00f6nrogge et al., 2006; Schweiger et al., 2007). In general, hoverflies are affected by the landscape matrix in a radius of 500\u20131000 m (Kleijn & Van Langevelde, 2006; Meyer et al., 2009).",

At the patch scale (habitat fragments), the probability of finding suitable microhabitats and floral resources increases with patch size. Thus, the abundance and species richness of hoverflies are predicted to be higher in large patches than in small patches (Sarthou et al., 2005; Ouin et al., 2006; Herrault et al., 2016). At the local scale, optimal foraging theory suggests that hoverflies should preferentially visit plots with high floral density because such plots provide a high quantity of resources at a low foraging cost (Meyer et al., 2009).",

Semi\u2010natural open habitats such as heathlands remain poorly studied, although they constitute habitats for many hoverfly species (77 species according to Speight et al., 2015; and see also Stubbs & Falk, 1983; Jacquemart, 1993; Mahy et al., 1998; Meyer et al., 2009; Descamps et al., 2015). Heathlands were extensively destroyed and fragmented in Europe during the last two centuries (Gimingham, 1972; Webb, 1998) and have been largely converted into agricultural or afforested areas (e.g. spruce plantations in Belgium, Clicheroux, 1957). Compared to forests and wetlands, heathlands do not offer many microhabitats for larvae (Speight & Castella, 2015), but they do offer floral resources for adult hoverflies during the entire flight period (Moquet et al., 2017a). The main floral resources in heathlands are ericaceous species, which provide pollen and nectar. Ericaceous species have poricidal anthers (which require vibrations to release pollen) and are therefore considered bee pollinated because their pollen is not easily accessible; nevertheless, these species are visited by hoverflies. Moreover, the presence of Salix spp. in wet heathlands in early spring provides floral resources for early emerging species (Moquet et al., 2015).",

Hull. These ericaceous species are dwarf evergreen shrubs (except V. myrtillus, which is deciduous). Floral morphology differs among species: E. tetralix and V. myrtillus have a deep and urceolate corolla (5\u20137 mm), V. vitis\u2010idaea has a campanulate corolla and C. vulgaris has an open corolla (Ritchie, 1955, 1956; Gimingham, 1960; Bannister, 1966). Flowers are tetra\u2010 or pentameric and secrete nectar at the base of the style. Except for C. vulgaris, pollen grains are contained in poricidal anthers only accessible to species able to generate vibrations (some bee species, Buchmann, 1983).

For each target plant species, we performed observations in at least six of the 10 heathland patches using a standardised method (Mayer et al., 2012; Descamps et al., 2015; Moquet et al., 2015). Observations took place when the weather conditions were appropriate (i.e. sunny days and wind speed <5 on the Beaufort scale), by one observer, in a plot of 10 m2 of ericaceous target plant species during 20 min. We conducted a total of 1190 sessions (396 h) over the 3 years. For S. x multinervis, observations were performed on a section of one grove with approximately 500 catkins of male individuals. When plant populations were sufficiently large, the position of the plot was changed each day of observation. Insects were considered visitors when they collected floral resources (pollen or nectar). The observer collected all insects visiting target plant species with an insect net. Hoverflies were identified in the field, to the species level when no confusion was possible (Episyrphus balteatus De Geer, Myathropa florea L., Rhingia campestris Meigen, Scaeva pyrastri L., S. selenitica Meigen, Sericomyia silentis Harris, S. lappona L., Syritta pipiens L., Volucella bombylans L.) or to morphotype, grouping morphologically similar species for the following genera: Chelosia, Chrysotoxum, Eristalis, Eupeodes, Helophilus, Platycheirus, Sphaerophoria, Syrphus. Insects were released on the plot immediately after the 20\u2010min session, except several individuals per morphotype (a total of 215 individuals) that were killed to determine the precise species diversity within each morphotype. Then, precise identification in the laboratory was conducted, using identification keys (Verlinden, 1994; Van Veen, 2004) and the reference collection of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. Abundance was calculated as the number of individuals and species richness was estimated as the number of morphotypes observed during 1 day (10 sessions of 20 min, Table 2).",

We pooled our observations by day (10 \u00d7 20 min sessions) resulting in 137 data points. The global model consisted of the six parameters as fixed effects and heathland patches, target plant species and year as random effects. These three factors were included as random effects because their levels were sampled from a larger sample (patches and years) and because we are interested in variation among levels rather than the specific effects of each level (target plant species, Bolker et al., 2009). We used a Poisson distribution, and ranked all possible models according to their Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) and selected the model with the smallest AICc (dredge command, R\u2010package MuMIn). When necessary, factors were rescaled with the standardised or rescale command of the R\u2010package arm.

Moreover, because we focused on flower visitors mainly on ericaceous species, it is not surprising that proboscis size explains a large amount of the variation in our study. In consequence, hoverfly species on heathlands can be separated into two groups: one composed of species with aphidophagous and terrestrial larvae, adults with a short or medium proboscis and having a preference for forests (coniferous and deciduous) or grasslands and heathlands; and the other composed of species with saprophagous and aquatic larvae, a long proboscis and a preference for wetlands and wet forests.",

Hoverfly abundance and species richness depend on factors related to floral resources for adults, such as the quantity and quality of pollen and nectar, as well as factors associated with larval development, such as microhabitat diversity (Meyer et al., 2009). Different scales were relevant depending on whether factors were related to larval or to adult resources.

A previous study found the opposite results for bumblebees in the same heathland patches and on the same target plant species, showing that bumblebee abundance was influenced by floral availability at the landscape scale (Moquet et al., 2017a). Differences in the spatial scale affecting Diptera and Hymenoptera imply that their perception of the landscape, foraging ranges and resource requirements differ (Kleijn & Van Langevelde, 2006; Jauker et al., 2009; \u00d6ckinger et al., 2012). Hoverflies disperse over very short distances (except during migration events), compared with bumblebees (200 m vs. up to 3000 m, L\u00f6vei et al., 1998; Wratten et al., 2003; Westphal et al., 2006). Therefore, only floral resources at a small scale influenced hoverfly abundance. Hoverfly abundance increased with floral density, which is consistent with other studies of hoverflies in agricultural landscapes (Meyer et al., 2009) and even other pollinators such as bumblebees and solitary bees (Sih & Baltus, 1987; Ohashi & Yahara, 2002; Somme et al., 2014). All these results are consistent with optimal foraging theory, which predicts higher abundance of pollinators in dense patches of flowers (Pyke et al., 1977). Indeed, high floral density provides a greater quantity of resources at lower foraging costs for all anthophilous insects (Hegland & Boeke, 2006).",

Species richness and abundance of saprophagous hoverflies were not affected, in the context of our study, by parameters related to larval wetland macrohabitats, but the abundance and species richness of aphidophagous hoverflies decreased with distance to forests. One other study has shown that landscape context affects differently according to hoverfly ecological traits (Schweiger et al., 2007); in this study, the main traits influencing response to landscape structure were degree of specialisation in habitat or in feeding. Aphidophagous species were probably more affected by landscape structure than saprophagous wetland species, because they need different resource patches for larval and adult stages. Such species require different landscape elements at different life stages (Dunning et al., 1992) and thus are particularly dependent on landscape heterogeneity (Fahrig & Nuttle, 2005). This sensitivity will depend on the interaction between heterogeneity and dispersal capability. Because we observed no aphidophagous species farther than 500 m from spruce plantations, we suppose that distance limited adult dispersal to heathlands. Some studies have found a low dispersal capability for aphidophagous forest species (Wratten et al., 2003; Herrault et al., 2016). Our results showed that, in this range, adult dispersal varied according to species, as some forest species were mainly found in forest\u2010dominated landscapes at close proximity to forest edges (M. cinctella and P. albimanus), while others were abundant in wetland\u2010dominated landscapes at larger distances from forest edges (Parasyrphus lineolus, Epistrophe grossulariae and Episyrphus balteatus).",
