Among various case series, the proportion of non-selected patients with COVID-19 and cancer ranges from 0.5%2 to 6%3, thus illustrating the issue of which cancer cases are counted. In an analysis of data from a cohort of 1,590 patients with COVID-19, the authors reported data from 18 patients (1.13% of the cohort) with a history of cancer4, noting that this percentage is substantially higher than that of the general population (0.29%). This appears to be a comparison of an incidence rate (0.29%) with a prevalence rate (1.13%). In examining the appendix of this report4 6 of the 18 patients with cancer were diagnosed with cancer <2 years before being diagnosed with COVID-19, while the other 12 had been diagnosed a median of 4.5 years previously. Elsewhere, Yu et al.5 reported that 12 of 1,524 patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms had a history of cancer (0.79%), although only four of these patients had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (defined as being severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive by PCR, in addition to previous contact with infected individuals, symptoms and/or ground-glass opacities on chest CT).",

The proportion of patients tested (18%) and infection rate (2.1%) seem higher than that of the broader population of France, with a 0.71% test rate, with 25% testing positive resulting in a 0.25% infection rate6. Thus, based on current evidence, patients with cancer might plausibly have a higher risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections. Comparisons of the prevalence of cancer among patients with COVID-19 to that of cancer in the community should be clear to use a similar definition of prevalence. Investigators comparing the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with cancer to that of a control group should provide clear definitions of testing criteria and cases in order to determine the extent to which the results are limited by ascertainment bias.",

The percentage of patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was not provided. The majority of patients (54%) were diagnosed with cancer within the previous year, and 16% had metastatic disease. The death rate and complication rates were significantly higher for patients with cancer (OR for death 2.34, 95% CI 1.15\u20134.77; P = 0.03). After adjusting for age, smoking status and comorbidities, the OR for death was 2.17 (P = 0.06). The risks of death or serious and/or critical symptoms appears to be mainly driven by the 16% of patients with metastatic disease (OR 5.58, 95% CI 1.7\u201318.23; P = 0.01 and OR 5.97, 95% CI 2.24\u201315.91; P < 0.01, respectively). These data suggest that the reported risks of poor outcomes reflect either residual confounding (for example, because patients with end-stage cancer might be more likely to die from COVID-19 because they have inherently worse general health and might already have compromised organ function) or misattribution of deaths.",
