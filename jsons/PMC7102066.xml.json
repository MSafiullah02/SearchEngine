Thus, it is imperative to discover innovative therapies to improve the treatment of this severe illness [1]. Recent experimental studies have suggested that allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have therapeutic potential in multiple preclinical injury models, such as myocardial infarction, diabetes, sepsis, graft-versus-host disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic failure, and acute renal failure [2]. Furthermore, MSC therapy has been investigated in various animal models of ALI/ARDS. These studies have shown the beneficial effects of MSCs in ALI/ARDS induced by bleomycin, ischemia-reperfusion (IR), live Escherichia coli bacteria, ventilator, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and cecal ligation and puncture [2\u20134]. Based on these preclinical studies, MSCs were suggested to reduce the severity of lung injury as well as enhance repair.",

However, many subsequent in vivo studies demonstrated low engraftment rates (<1%) in lung injury models [2]. Additionally, the protective effect of MSCs was found to be comparable to MSC-conditioned medium (CM) alone [5]. Therefore, the beneficial effects of MSCs appear to be a result of the release of various paracrine factors with immunomodulatory properties. The use of MSC-CM has several advantages: MSC-CM can be easily generated, frozen, and transported, does not contain live cells, and cannot be rejected by the host immune system. Thus, the administration of MSC-CM may offer a new approach for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.",

These findings open new therapeutic options for treating IR-induced lung injury.

Several soluble paracrine factors, such as angiopoietin-1, keratinocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth factors, and hepatocyte growth factor, were found to maintain the integrity of pulmonary endothelial cells, restore lung endothelial and epithelial permeability, improve the ability of the alveolar epithelium to remove alveolar edema fluid, and inhibit leukocyte\u2013endothelium interactions by modifying endothelial cell adhesion molecules and cell junctions [18, 23, 24].

            "text": "The transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, regulates and enhances the expression of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules, resulting in the recruitment of a large influx of inflammatory cells to the lung. NF-\u03baB activation involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, which allows NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of inflammatory genes such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [33, 34]. Previous and current studies have revealed that IR-induced lung injury decreases I\u03baB-\u03b1 levels and induces NF-\u03baB signaling activation. The activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway triggered the production and secretion of cytokines and chemokines [10\u201313]. In this study, we showed that NCSC-CM suppressed the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in IR lung injury by inhibiting the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. Consequently, NCSC-CM reduced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 after IR injury to the lung. These results were similar to those of previous experiments showing that MSCs suppressed NF-\u03baB activation in reporter cells following incubation with LPS-inflamed serum and in IR lung injury in rats [35, 36].",

A variety of other factors may be present in CM and act in combination to elicit the observed protection. Therefore, it is important to analyze a complete set of growth factor and cytokine levels from different stem cell-derived CM. The optimal culture condition, CM processing, dose, and route, as well as the diseases that are responsive to CM therapy, need to be further investigated [22]. Recent in vivo studies underscore the potential new role of microvesicles or exosomes released from MSCs as a paracrine vehicle to deliver messenger RNA or proteins to targeted cells and affect multiple biological events [37, 38].",
