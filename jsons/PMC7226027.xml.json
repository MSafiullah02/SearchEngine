Thus, they play pivotal roles in regulation of protein turnover in nearly all organisms [1,2,3,4]. Many but not all of these enzymes are zinc dependent. Inhibition of a certain aminopeptidase activity usually results in profound effects on cell survival and proliferation. This suggests that aminopeptidases should be considered attractive targets for combating devastating human diseases; for instance, cancer, malaria or bacterial infections [5,6,7,8].",

            "text": "Zinc-dependent mammalian aminopeptidase N (alanine aminopeptidase, APN/CD13) is a type II trans-membrane enzyme belonging to M1 of the MA clan. APN mainly cleaves the neutral amino acid from N-terminus of peptides and proteins. Consequently, it plays multifunctional roles in important biological processes, including antigen processing and presentation; tumor invasion and metastasis; cell adhesion and motility; and neurotransmitter degradation [9,10,11,12]. It also serves as a receptor for entry of certain coronaviruses [13,14]. Since it was the first metallo-aminopeptidase to be biochemically and enzymatically characterized, it is perhaps the most extensively studied member in this family. Critical relevance of its activity for cancer progression caused intensive studies to be undertaken to develop new drugs directed towards this enzyme, including enzyme inhibitors and APN-targeted carrier constructs [15,16]. As a consequence, a variety of APN inhibitors have been developed [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. The most successful example of this approach is bestatin, which is capable of inhibiting the growth of several tumors and is clinically used in the treatment with acute adult nonlymphocytic leukemia [24]. Since its discovery in 1974, it has remained the only inhibitor of APN on the market. Thus, to unlock the therapeutic potential of APN inhibitors, the design and synthesis of novel potent and selective inhibitors is required.",

            "text": "Since phenylalanine is quite commonly used scaffold in aminopeptidase inhibitors, we report the identification and characterization of a set of low-molecular phosphonic analogs of this amino acid as inhibitors of porcine and human enzymes. Phosphonic analog of phenylalanine (compound 1a) is a micromolar inhibitor of porcine aminopeptidase N [25]. This work is a further development of the structural modulation of this molecule by studying the influences of substitutions of its aromatic ring with fluorine atoms on the inhibitory activity. Fluorine is considered to be a good mimic of hydrogen in medicinal chemistry, since the carbon-to-fluorine bond is only slightly (about 20%) longer than the carbon-to-hydrogen bond, and thus substitution of hydrogen by fluorine is well tolerated by a variety of proteins [26]. On the other hand, the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine significantly affects electrostatic interactions. Additionally, it is well known that the introduction of fluorine atoms usually positively affects nearly all properties of the drug, and thus, today approximately 20\u201330% of pharmaceuticals on the marked are fluorinated molecules [27]. The favorable effect of the substitution of hydrogen for fluorine in the case of aminopeptidase inhibitors has been recently proven by our studies on phenylglycine analogs [28]. Thus, this report might be considered as an extension of that study. It describes far more effective inhibitors with non-trivial modes of binding, as suggested by molecular modelling.",

Fluorogenic substrate\u2014Ala-AMC (l-alanine-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) was obtained from PeptaNova (Sandhausen, Germany). Both enzymes were dissolved in corresponding 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer and directly used in enzymatic analysis. The pHs of the buffers were as follows: 7.00 for hAPN and 7.20 for pAPN. Michaelis constants (Km) for the both enzymes towards Ala-AMC were determined as described in the literature [31]. Km values were 73 \u00b5M for hAPN and 90 \u00b5M for pAPN. Due to the very high polarity and low solubility of all the inhibitors in the assay buffer, they were transformed into hydrochlorides. Inhibitory constants measurements were carried out in 96-well plates, the total volume of 100 \u00b5L at 37 \u00b0C using a spectrofluorometer (SpectraMax Gemini EM fluorometer\u2014Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) operating at two wavelengths: excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm. hAPN and pAPN were preincubated for 30 min in the assay buffer and further added to the wells containing appropriate concentrations of the substrate and the inhibitor. The measurement conditions in the plates were as follows: (i) eight inhibitor concentrations in the range 100\u20130.8 \u00b5M, (ii) substrate concentration of 50 \u00b5M for hAPN and 80 \u00b5M for pAPN and (iii) enzyme concentrations of 0.66 nM. The release of the fluorogenic leaving group of AMC was monitored for at least 15 min. The rate of enzymatic reaction was studied following the reaction progress curve, based on which velocity was calculated. Each experiment was repeated three times and standard deviation values were calculated. The type of the inhibition and inhibitory constants were calculated by using the Lineweaver\u2013Burk, Dixon plot and Cheng\u2013Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50/[1 + (S/Km)] as described earlier [32]. Kinetics parameters were calculated using GrafPad Prism and Microsoft Excel computer programs.",

Subsequent reaction of these mixtures with hydroxylamine resulted in mixtures of E/Z oximes 5. Reduction of the oximes, performed by using ammonium formate and zinc in molar ratio 2:1 [46], provided two phosphonates\u2013compounds 6 and their formylated derivatives 7 clearly seen in 31P NMR spectra.

Figure 1 presents global views of the results of docking of all the 25 analogs (both isomers) of phenylalanine (compounds 1a\u20131z) to hAPN (Figure 1A) and pAPN (Figure 1B). These studies revealed an almost identical coordination mode of the aminophosphonate portions of all molecules to both enzymes. The phosphonate group is considered a transition-state analog of the hydrolysis of peptide bond, and its binding seems to confirm this assumption. Thus, two phosphonate oxygens are involved in zinc complexation, whereas a third oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with tyrosine (Tyr472 of pAPN and Tyr477 of hAPN). In most cases the free \u03b1-amino group shows a typical pattern of contacts with glutamate and glutamine residues (Glu350 and Glu384 of pAPN; and Glu355, Glu411 and Gln213 of hAPN). The hydrophobic S1 pocket of both aminopeptidases is responsible for recognition of N-terminal amino acids of the hydrolyzed substrates. Filling the S1 pocket with aromatic fragments of inhibitors should thus play a canonical role in inhibitory process. The molecular docking indicated that it indeed seems to be true for the human enzyme; however, in rare cases, the aromatic side-chains of the studied inhibitors interact preferably with the S1\u2032 pocket, a pocket which is naturally involved in accommodating the C-terminal side of a hydrolyzed peptide substrate. In the case of the porcine enzyme, reversal of this situation is observed, since most of the inhibitors locate their aromatic parts in the S1\u2032 pocket, which is a surprising and unexpected result. A similar effect, albeit less pronounced, was already observed earlier for interactions of phosphonic acid analogs of phenylglycine and pAPN [28].",

Moreover, fluorine atoms are involved in hydrogen bonds with some portions of the enzyme (Gln213 and Glu389 in the case of hAPN and Ala346 for pAPN). Thus, the pattern of binding does not explain the huge (two orders in magnitude) differences in affinities of 1t versus 1g observed experimentally. However, calculations indicate that there exists strong internal hydrogen bonding between fluorine and amine nitrogen atoms in molecule 1g (Figure S9C), which has to be disrupted upon binding. This might affect the energetics of the binding similarly to that reported for the influence the desolvation of peptidomimetic inhibitors, which strongly decreases their affinities towards thermolysin [52].",

Although modeling predicts that aromatic side chains of the studied inhibitors are bound in two different hydrophobic pockets (S1 in case of hAPN and S1\u2032 for pAPN) the structure\u2013activity relationship is similar for both enzymes. This suggests that S1 and S1\u2032 pockets are similar to each other. On the other hand, the bindings of the aromatic moieties of 1i, 1l and 1t to the S1 pocket of hAPN versus the S1\u2032 pocket of pAPN seem to explain the differences in affinities of these compounds towards both enzymes.",

The most active compounds of the series (1i, 1l and 1t) may be considered as interesting building blocks for the synthesis of novel inhibitors of aminopeptidases. Computer-aided modeling of their interactions with both enzymes have shown that their aminophosphonate fragments are uniformly bound to the active sites of both aminopeptidases, whereas binding of the aromatic portions of inhibitory molecules to the spacious hydrophobic pockets S1 and S1\u2032 is dependent of their substitution patterns and weakly dependent on the absolute molecular configuration.",
