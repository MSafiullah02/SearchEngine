Several recently emerging viruses belong to the Bunyavirales order (classified until recently simply as the Bunyaviridae family), a large group of enveloped RNA viruses that comprise more than 350 named virus isolates divided among nine virus families and thirteen genera, including some which cause important diseases in humans, livestock and crops (Adams et al., 2017, Ergonul, 2012, McMullan et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Within the Peribunyaviridae, the genus Orthobunyavirus includes more than 170 named viruses some of which are of medical and veterinary importance (Elliott, 2014). The orthobunyavirus genome comprises three segments referred to as large (L), medium (M) and small (S). The large segment encodes for the viral polymerase. The M segment encodes for the viral glycoproteins Gn-NSm-Gc that are synthesized as a poplyprotein precursor that is later proteolitically cleaved. The S segment encodes for the viral nucleocapsid and the non-structural protein NSs in an overlapping reading frame (Eifan et al., 2013).",

For example, SBV emerged in Germany in the summer of 2011 (Hoffmann et al., 2012) and spread very rapidly throughout Europe. On the bases of epidemiological data and the similarity of SBV to other orthobunyaviruses infecting ruminants, the risk of transmission of SBV to humans was considered low. Indeed, subsequent studies showed that no antibodies against this virus were detected in individuals in contact with infected animals (Ducomble et al., 2012, Reusken et al., 2012). Hence, with some notable exceptions (i.e. CVV), it appears that many of the medically or veterinary relevant orthobunyaviruses have a fairly strict host range as they cause disease either in humans or ruminants.",

            "text": "Virus tropism for a particular animal species is determined by many factors including, in some cases, innate immune responses. Vertebrates have evolved a variety of mechanisms to counteract exposure to pathogens. A key innate immune mechanism to fight virus infection is the type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory responses. Secretion of IFN by infected cells leads to autocrine and paracrine signaling resulting in the activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) some of which have a direct or indirect antiviral effect (Nan et al., 2014, Yan and Chen, 2012). In turn, viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract host restriction factors. Available evidence, mainly provided by studies on primate lentiviruses (Wain et al., 2007), suggests that viruses that have successfully established themselves in a given species are able to counteract, at least partially, the innate immune response of the host (Hrecka et al., 2011, Stremlau et al., 2004, Stremlau et al., 2006). Conversely, the same viruses cannot overcome the innate responses of non-susceptible species. Hence, sequence differences within ISGs orthologues could provide at least partial susceptibility or resistance to a given virus infection.",

            "text": "As most emerging human viruses are predicted to be zoonotic in origin (Mandl et al., 2014), it is important to assess the zoonotic potential of any newly discovered veterinary pathogen. Understanding the molecular mechanisms determining virus host range is key to gain insight into the rules that govern viral emergence. Cross-species transmission requires overcoming host-specific barriers that can be present at each stage of the viral replication cycle and can be specific for different animal species. Our understanding of the effect of host ISGs on bunyavirus host range, as well as the molecular adaptations required to overcome host genetic barriers is limited. In vitro, orthobunyaviruses grow extremely efficiently in a variety of cell lines derived from different species. Hence, the host range of these viruses does not seem to be due to species-specific cellular receptors or other factors absolutely required for virus replication. An ISG with a broad inhibitory activity against enveloped viruses is BST-2 (also known as tetherin, CD317, HM1.24) (Neil et al., 2008, Sauter, 2014, Van Damme et al., 2008). BST-2 is a type II membrane protein with an unusual topology consisting of a coiled-coiled ectodomain bound to the cell membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal GPI anchor. The BST2 gene is duplicated in ruminants: sheep and cows possess two BST2 paralogs, BST2A and BST2B, both with antiviral properties although probably displaying different mechanisms of action (Murphy et al., 2014, Takeda et al., 2012). Ovine BST2B (oBST2B) displays particular features: it lacks predicted glycosylation sites and a carboxy terminal GPI anchor, resulting in a protein that is retained within the Golgi apparatus (Murphy et al., 2014). In this study, we investigated the role of BST-2 in determining orthobunyavirus host range. We found that BST-2 restricts orthobunyaviruses replication in a species-specific manner and thus likely contributes to determine the host range of this important group of viruses.",

Five days post-transfection, supernatants were collected, virus concentrated by centrifugation and pellets analyzed by western blotting (Fig. 1A). We found a reduction in the amount of SBV nucleocapsid protein (SBV N) in the supernatants of transfected cells suggesting less efficient rescue of SBV in the presence of hBST2. To confirm these results, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the hBST2 gene or an empty plasmid as a control and 14 h post-transfection cells were infected with SBV at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.001). Virus replication kinetics was monitored for 72 h. We found decreased SBV infectious titers in samples derived from cells transfected with hBST2 compared to control cells (Fig. 1B-C). We then developed HEK 293T cells stably expressing hBST2 (termed 293-hBST2) by transduction with retroviral vectors carrying hBST2 tagged with the HA epitope or an empty retroviral vector (termed 293-control) as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1D, all cells expressed hBST2 and, as expected, this cell line was capable of restricting the release of HIV-1 lacking the accessory protein Vpu, a known BST-2 antagonist (Neil et al., 2008) (Fig. 1E). We then compared the SBV replication kinetics in 293-hBST2 and 293-control (Fig. 1F). We found a 10-fold reduction in the titers of SBV produced in 293-hBST2 cells compared to those obtained in 293-control. We obtained the same results using another independently established HEK 293T cell line stably expressing huBST2 (not shown). Importantly, the restriction of SBV in 293-hBST2 cells could be partially overcome by transient transfection of a plasmid expressing HIV-1 Vpu, a known BST2 antagonist (Fig. 1G).",

We found no difference in the number of SBV positive cells between 293-hBST2 and control cells indicating that hBST2 does not impact SBV entry (Fig. S1A).

In order to confirm these data, we performed a protein stripping assay. If hBST2 causes protein tethering on the surface of virus-infected cells we would expect to recover more virions from hBST2-expressing cells than control cells after protease treatment. 293-hBST2 and control cells were infected with SBV and 48 h post-infection virions were stripped from the cell surface by treatment with the protease subtilisin-A.

We found a significant decrease in the Gc/N ratio in SBV virions produced in 293-hBST2 suggesting that viral envelope protein incorporation is hampered by hBST2. In order to understand whether the reduced amount of Gc glycoprotein in released virions was the result of a reduced production of Gc in cells stably expressing hBST2 or rather due to the reduced incorporation of Gc into nascent virions, we quantified the amount of Gc in total cells lysates of 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells infected with SBV. To capture the kinetics of Gc expression. To capture the kinetics of Gc expression, we collected lysates early post infection starting from 12 h, which was the earliest time point in which we could detect viral protein expression by western blotting (Fig. 3C). We found statistically significant reduced quantities of Gc glycoprotein in hBST2 cells relative to control cells at all times post infection except at 12 h. At the same time, we quantified the quantities of N and we found that these were also reduced in SBV-infected 293-hBST2 relative to 293-control cells, but the differences reached statistical significance only at 16 h post infection. We also quantified the relative effect of hBST2 on Gc and N expression by estimating the area under the curve (AUC) between 12 and 22 h post infection in 293-control and 293-hBST32. We found a bigger difference in the AUC between 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells for Gc than for N, supporting the idea that hBST2 targets Gc production more effectively.",

To this end, we developed HEK 293T cell lines stably expressing the ovine orthologues of BST-2 (oBST2A and oBST2B) and assessed the replication kinetics of the bunyaviruses used above. We found that the replication of orthobunyaviruses with only ruminant tropism (SBV, AKAV and SATV) was not impaired by oBST2A and oBST2B (Fig. 4B). However, the replication of human-tropic OROV and LACV was restricted by the ovine BST2 orthologues (Fig. 4B). As expected the ovine orthologues could not restrict the replication of CVV. The patterns of expression of the 293-oBST2A and 293-oBST2B cell lines are shown in Fig. 4C.

            "text": "It is important to stress that orthobunyaviruses encode a non-structural protein (NSs) that inhibits global cellular transcription and therefore the activation of ISGs in general (Elliott, 2014). Hence, it may be counterintuitive to expect that individual ISGs may contribute to determine the host range of orthobunyaviruses considering that these viruses hamper the host antiviral responses by blocking expression of all ISGs. However, some restriction factors such as BST-2 are constitutively expressed in some cell types in addition to being expressed in response to IFN production. These factors are often referred to as part of the \u201cintrinsic\u201d immune response of the host as they are available in the cell even before pathogens are sensed and the IFN response is initiated (Yan and Chen, 2012). Here, we show that BST-2 restricts orthobunyavirus replication in a species-specific manner. In vitro, orthobunyaviruses are able to infect a variety of cell lines of different species. This indicates that the host range of these viruses does not totally depend on receptor availability or other factors required for viral replication. For example, SBV antibodies have been detected in deer, elks, buffalos, alpacas and dogs among others (Lievaart-Peterson et al., 2015) but so far disease has only been documented in ruminants in the form of abortions and congenital malformations. AKAV has been detected in camels, horses, buffalos and dogs but it is only pathogenic in domestic ruminants (Kirkland, 2015). OROV causes febrile illness in humans but it has also been isolated from primates and sloths (Bastos Mde et al., 2012) while LACV causes encephalitis in humans but no disease presents in chipmunks or squirrels which are also hosts (Beaty and Calisher, 1991, Grimstad, 1988). We found that human BST-2 was unable to restrict replication of OROV and LACV while the ovine orthologues did not restrict the growth of the ruminant viruses SBV, AKAV and SATV. Interestingly, neither the human nor the ruminant BST-2 impaired the replication of CVV which has been associated with abortions and congenital malformations in ruminants as well as encephalitis in humans (Chung et al., 1990, Sexton et al., 1997). These results are in accordance with a previous report which showed that human BST-2 does not restrict the replication of Rift Valley Fever virus, a phlebovirus responsible of congenital abnormalities in ruminants as well as the cause of febrile illness in humans (Radoshitzky et al., 2010).",

However, the role of BST-2 in influencing orthobunyavirus host range will likely derive from a variety of factors including its sites and timing of expression and its efficiency of restriction of a given virus. Ultimately many other factors, including the timing and efficiency of total cellular protein shut-down induced by viral NSs will determine orthobunyaviruses host range.",

The most common mechanism of viral restriction by BST-2 described so far involves the physical attachment of virions to the cell membrane of infected cells (Perez-Caballero et al., 2009). However, we previously showed that the ovine orthologue oBST2B restricts sheep retroviruses by reducing the incorporation of envelope glycoprotein into nascent viral particles (Murphy et al., 2014). Here we found that hBST2 restricts SBV replication by reducing the incorporation of the Gc glycoprotein into virions.",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which BST-2 targets orthobunyavirus glycoproteins are not known. However, it does not seem to be the result of a general disruption of viral protein synthesis or turnover by BST-2 given that the same orthologue expressed in the same cell line has a different impact on replication of different orthobunyaviruses. In addition, restriction is not impacted by the addition of inhibitors of the proteasome thus discarding the possibility that BST-2 can induce the degradation of viral proteins. One of the ovine paralogues (oBST2B) lacks a predicted glycosylation sites and the carboxy-terminal GPI anchor which results in a protein that is retained within the Golgi apparatus. Bunyaviruses are thought to assemble at membranes of the Golgi apparatus that have been modified by the insertion of the viral glycoproteins. Newly formed viral RNPs locate beneath the modified membranes. It is believed that the interaction between the RNPs and the cytoplasmic tail of either or both the viral glycoproteins triggers budding (Overby et al., 2007, Shi et al., 2007). Thus, crosstalk between orthobunyavirus glycoproteins and BST-2 orthologues may occur in this cellular compartment. However, we found no SBV Gc and hBST2 colocalization in infected cells or expressing SBV Gc by transient transfection indicating that the mechanism of action of hBST2 might be either indirect or involve interaction with another viral protein (i.e. Gn). On the other hand, we cannot assume that glycoproteins from different orthobunyaviruses are translated and traffic in the cytoplasm in exactly the same way. Hence, the species-specificity of BST-2 restriction could be related to differential translation and recruitment of viral proteins for budding.",
