This notion was further supported\nby numerous studies that reported the poor phosphorylation of nucleoside\nanalogues into their nucleoside monophosphates as the rate-limiting\nstep in their in situ activation.24\u221227 However, the idea of using nucleoside\nanalogue monophosphates as therapeutics faced two main challenges.\nFirst, these compounds would have poor in vivo stability due to dephosphorylation\nin the bloodstream, and second, their transport into cells will be\ninefficient because of the charged nature of the phosphorylated nucleoside.\nTo address the P\u2013O\u2212 bond instability, Hol\u00fd and\nDe Clercq switched the P\u2013O\u2013 bonds in the monophosphate\ngroup of nucleoside analogues into monophosphonate P-CH2\u2013 bonds.28 This led to improved\nin situ stability, which translated into longer half-lives of the\nnucleoside monophosphonates as compared to their monophosphates.28 This advance in the design of stable nucleotide\ntherapeutics inspired the discovery of many nucleoside analogue monophosphonates,\nsome of which were eventually approved for clinical use as antivirals\nagainst HCMV [i.e., cidofovir], HBV [i.e., adefovir and tenofovir],\nand HIV [i.e., tenofovir] (Figure 2).7",

Numerous prodrug technologies that mask either one\nor two of the oxygens of the monophosphate and monophosphonate groups\nmaking the molecule more lipophilic and hence improve transport into\nthe cells have been developed.13,29\u221231 Among these prodrug approaches is the ProTide prodrug technology\nthat was pioneered by Prof. Chris McGuigan (Cardiff, UK).32 This prodrug technology has proved to be a powerful\ntool in the discovery of efficacious nucleoside monophosphate and\nmonophosphonate prodrug therapeutics.33 To date, it has delivered at least 10 clinical candidates that reached,\nor successfully passed, phase I clinical trials.33 Although most of these nucleotide prodrugs were developed\nas antiviral agents against HIV, HBV, HCV, and Ebola virus, the most\nrecent ones are also being pursued as potential anticancer agents.\nMoreover, the ProTide prodrug technology has so far led to the discovery\nof two FDA-approved (antiviral) drugs, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)34 and sofosbuvir35 (Figure 3).13",

Indeed, the masking of AZT monophosphate by diaryl motifs\nwas pursued (Stage 5, Table 1).56 These prodrugs showed good\nanti-HIV activity and, remarkably, some of them showed much better\nanti-HIV activity than the parent compound AZT.56 In the journey toward the ProTides, this was the first\ntime a phosphate prodrug was more active than the parent compound.\nInterestingly, these phosphate prodrugs retained their anti-HIV activity\nin cell lines that were considered to be resistant to AZT.56 However, when these cells (T lymphocyte cell\nline, JM) were used for this study back in 1992, they were considered\nas AZT insensitive due to poor phosphorylation of AZT.57 But, it was later shown that such AZT resistance\nwas a result of an active AZT-efflux pump rather than inefficient\nintracellular phosphorylation.58 Regardless\nof the exact AZT-insensitivity mechanism in this cell line, the AZT\ndiaryl phosphate prodrugs were more active than their parent compound,\nproviding a clear indication of an increased delivery of AZT monophosphate\ninto the cells. This notion was further supported by the fact that para-nitrophenyl phosphate masking groups had ca. 100-fold\nbetter anti-HIV activity than their unsubstituted phenyl masking groups\nmost probably due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the para-nitro group that speeds up the demasking of the prodrugs\nin cells.56 A further study on the effect\nof the nature of the phenyl substituents on the antiviral activity\nof diaryl phosphate prodrugs of AZT was then conducted.59,60 This study confirmed that stronger para-electron-withdrawing\ngroups on the phenyl phosphate masking groups gave better anti-HIV\nactivity.59,60 Intriguingly, these AZT diaryl phosphate\nprodrugs as well as AZT did not exhibit any anti-HIV activity in a\nthymidine kinase (TK)-deficient human T-lymphocyte cell line (CEM/TK\u2013).60 McGuigan and colleagues\nconcluded that this might have been due to poor intracellular release\nof AZT monophosphate. The development of diaryl monophosphate prodrugs\nwas not progressed any further and the focus turned back to phosphoramidates,\nwhich showed good biological activity.56",

Notably, there was a preference for the l-alanine\namino acid as compared to l-leucine (>10-fold) and glycine\n(>100-fold), while electron-withdrawing para-substituted\naryls were less potent that their unsubstituted moieties.61 Further studies into these substitutions concluded\nthat para-fluoro aryls did not largely affect the\nbiological activity while para-nitro-substitutions\nhad detrimental effects on the biological activity, namely a 100-fold\nloss in activity.62 In a separate study,\nit was shown that para-nitrophenyl-containing nucleoside\nmonophosphate prodrugs were toxic even to uninfected cells.63 Remarkably, AZT aryloxy phosphoramidates retained\ntheir anti-HIV activities in thymidine kinase deficient (TK\u2013) cells.62 These observations provided\na direct proof of the ability of aryloxy phosphoramidates to deliver\nintact nucleoside analogue monophosphates into intact cells.

The coupling reaction takes place in the\npresence of either the Grignard reagent tert-butyl\nmagnesium chloride (tBuMgCl) or N-methylimidazole (NMI), which act as a base. The choice of the base\nis often influenced by the nucleoside substrate, most precisely the\nnumber of hydroxyl groups that could couple to the phosphorochloridate.\nFor instance, in ribonucleosides, the base used is often NMI and this\ngenerates mostly the 5\u2032-O- hosphoramidates\ndue to steric hindrance and the fact that it is a weaker base than tBuMgCl. However, in cases where the nucleoside has only\none hydroxyl group, the base of choice is tBuMgCl,\nwhich often gives higher yields of the product as compared to NMI.\nNotably, the approach of coupling the nucleoside to a phosphorochloridate\nyields a mixture of diastereoisomers. In some cases, the two ProTide\ndiastereoisomers exhibit similar potency and their development therefore\nis pursued as a mixture of diastereoisomers (see examples in Figure 10).64 In other cases, the two diastereoisomers may have different\nrates of metabolism and hence varying potency. For instance, the Sp-diastereoisomer of the clinically used ProTide sofosbuvir\nexhibits a 10-fold increase in antiviral activity than its Rp-diastereoisomer.35 In these\ninstances, the separation of the two diastereoisomers becomes necessary.\nThe separation of these by column chromatography has proved to be\na stern challenge.",

            "text": "A notable result that\nemerged from the ProTide was that it was\nable to effectively overcome gemcitabine resistance. This was attributed\nto three main reasons: first, cytidine deaminase is an enzyme found\nin both serum and cells and is known to catabolize gemcitabine. For\ndeamination to occur, unprotected hydroxyl groups on the 3\u2032-\nand 5\u2032-position of the nucleoside analogue must be present.99 ProTide 1 demonstrated resistance\nto deamination because of the presence of the phosphoramidate moiety\non the 5\u2032-O-position of the ribose moiety.\nA second advantage of being resistant to deaminase breakdown is an\nincreased safety profile, as lesser toxic metabolite (2\u2032,2\u2032-difluorodeoxyuridine)\nwould be produced.64 Second, it was found\nthat the cellular uptake of 1 was not dependent upon\nnucleoside transporters and that the ProTide was lipophilic enough\nto enter the cells via passive diffusion. This was deduced following\nan experiment involving dipyridamole, a known inhibitor of the human\nequilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), to mimic the downregulation\nof nucleoside transport in cancer cells. Gemcitabine was incubated\nwith pancreatic PANC1 cancer cells in the presence of dipyridamole,\nand it was found that its cytotoxic activity was significantly reduced,\nwith the cytostatic activity decreasing from 611 nM to >2000 nM\n(CC50). Contrastingly, even with blockage of hENT1, the\nactivity\nof 1 remained fairly constant (CC50 = 162\n\u03bcM), thus confirming that the cellular uptake of 1 is independent of nucleoside transporters.64 Third, the structure of the ProTide is such that it is able to overcome\nthe rate-limiting first phosphorylation-mediated by deoxycytidine\nkinase which is downregulated in certain cancers. This was confirmed\nby little change in the activity of 1 when incubated\nwith RT112 cancer cells in the presence of 2\u2032-deoxycytidine\nbeing the competing natural substrate for gemcitabine activation to\nits 5\u2032-monophosphate by 2\u2032-deoxycytidine kinase (EC50 = 0.7 \u03bcM in the presence of 2\u2032-deoxycytidine\ncompared to 0.2 \u03bcM in the dCyd absence). Conversely, the activity\nof gemcitabine decreased when 2\u2032-deoxcytidine was coadministered\nas the two compounds competed for the same active site on the deoxycytidine\nkinase.64",

FdU is a metabolite which gets formed in vivo from the pharmacologically\nactive anticancer agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Initially discovered\nby McGuigan and his colleagues in 2011 after extensive SAR studies,79 ProTide 2 displayed promising preclinical\nresults and initial studies highlighted its superiority over its parent\nnucleoside, 5-FU. The path toward the final structure of 2 began with McGuigan and his co-workers by synthesizing and comparing\n39 different ProTides, with variations in the aryl, ester, and amino\nacid regions.79 There was little difference\nobserved in the potency of the ProTides upon varying the amino acid\nester region and also upon changing the nature of the amino acid. l-Alanine has long been the amino acid of choice when formulating\nProTides, but there was little to discern between l-alanine\nand the other amino acids in these experiments. Generally, the ProTides\nyielding the 1-naphthyl group displayed more potency than phenyl-containing\nProTides, thus leading to the deduction that the 1-naphthyl, benzyl\nester-containing ProTide was the most effective.79 To determine the cytotoxic activity of 2,\nin vitro studies were conducted involving human tumor cell lines (colorectal,\nlung, ovarian, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and cervix).

Having emerged as the superior ProTide out\nof 50 other ProTides developed,35 sofosbuvir\nwas acquired by Gilead Sciences, where it adopted the identity sofosbuvir\nand underwent further extensive clinical evaluation. Sofosbuvir was\nfound to act by inhibiting the HCV NS5B polymerase, an enzyme responsible\nfor the replication of the viral genome. Inhibition of this enzyme\nwould result in RNA chain termination and ultimately stop the replication\nof HCV.35 Following cellular uptake by\nhepatocytes, sofosbuvir undergoes sequential hydrolysis by cathepsin\nA and CES1 to form the active nucleoside monophosphate. Further hydrolysis\nby HINT1 and subsequent phosphorylations yielded the pharmacologically\nactive triphosphate metabolite, which exerts its action on NS5B polymerase.108 Initial animal studies of sofosbuvir were encouraging.\nThe ProTide was well absorbed following oral administration in portal\nvein cannulated dogs, bioavailability was 9.9%, which equated to a\nfraction absorbed of 36%.109 In human subjects,\nthe absolute bioavailability was not determined, although over 80%\nof the administered dose was absorbed.

This indicated the efficacy of\nsofosbuvir in treating different HCV genotypes, confirming similar\nearlier preclinical observations.114 In\na placebo-controlled phase III study comparing sofosbuvir and ribavirin\nfor 12 weeks with matched interferon ineligible controls in genotype\n2 and 3 patients, sustained viral response was achieved in 78% of\ntreated patients with 93% response rate in genotype 2 patients and\n61% in genotype 3 patients.115 In a study\ninvolving patients who had previously been treated with interferon\nwho were treated with either sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks\nfollowed by placebo for 4 weeks or sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 16\nweeks, response rates showed a 73% SVR12 in the 16-week arm compared\nto 50% of the 12-week arm. Impressively, 94% of genotype 2 patients\nachieved SVR12 within 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin,\nwhile 87% achieved it within 16 weeks. As for genotype 3 patients,\n30% of patients achieved SVR12 within 12 weeks compared to 62% within\n16 weeks. Notably, 46% of the patients treated with sofosbuvir and\nribavirin for 12 weeks had viral relapse compared to 27% of the 16-week\ntreatment arm. In another study, the efficacy of extended treatment\nof 24 weeks of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in genotype 3 patients was\nevaluated.116 The results showed that 93%\nof the 73 patients with genotype 2 who took part achieved SVR12 within\n12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin treatment, whereas 85% of the\n250 patients with genotype 3 treated for 24 weeks with sofosbuvir\nand ribavirin achieved SVR12. This was the first large scale study\nshowing the efficacy of prolonged interferon-free treatments in genotype\n3 patients. Given the excellent safety profile and pan-genotypic efficacy\nof sofosbuvir, it has been licensed for clinical use in combination\nwith pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and the NS5A inhibitors ledipasvir\nand velpatasvir depending on the HCV genotype to be treated.117 Collectively, this has made sofosbuvir a cornerstone\nin HCV therapy.",
