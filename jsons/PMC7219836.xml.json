By 2017, 93% of small rural hospitals and 80% of office-based physician practices possessed certified health information technology.4 Notably, the staged approach to EHR adoption delayed interoperability requirements until the final stage of adoption.5",

This failure has necessitated the development of health care integration engine software products to bridge the gap, yet another source of financial inefficiency in US health care.6 Furthermore, aspects of the SMART on FHIR specification remain incomplete. For example, there is no implementation guide for intraoperative anesthesia data, although one may be developed by 2021.7 It is notable that the HL7 development work in anesthesiology is done entirely by volunteers.",

The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), a collaborative group of investigators mostly funded by public granting agencies, is presently in the sixth version of its Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Once an organization transforms its data into the OMOP model, as many have, it can participate in data analysis with any number of arbitrary partners through a federated mechanism.8 As with HL7, there is no standard in OMOP for anesthesiology data, and standards for data from critical care environments remain underdeveloped. Within anesthesiology, the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group offers arguably the most comprehensive candidate common data model, although costs of participation are high, and most participating sites are academic centers.9",

To briefly recap, if hospitals across the country were able to observe and interpret data being gathered at other institutions in realtime and to contribute their own data to the shared repository, the health care system could be learning about and improving its care of COVID-19 patients continuously and collaboratively, based on the sum total of available information rather than incrementally in silos. Even as biomedical publishing gradually evolves to become more agile and rapid, traditional approaches to medical knowledge creation and dissemination remain unacceptably slow and continue to permit the dissemination of inaccurate information in the midst of a pandemic. Indeed, calls have been made to address the ongoing \u201cinfodemic\u201d (as it has been dubbed by the World Health Organization).16 Additionally, the sharing of data across health systems would hold hospitals accountable for providing care that is consistent with agreed-upon ethical principles during public health crises, such as allocating treatments in ways that maximize the number of lives saved and treating patients equitably with regard to race, ethnicity, and insurance status.",

Because the system relies on manual case review and entry, data captured aredelayed and results are aggregated on a quarterly basis, too slow and too errorprone in the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic.17 The centralized approach also introduces concerns related to oversight and performance penalties, as well as barriers to use by academic researchers. Unlike the NSHN, such a system would need to automate aggregation to real-time or near real-time status, provide mechanisms to allow research use of data, provide systems for deidentification of data and protections against reidentification of patients, and potentially be firewalled from traditional quality and pay-for-performance reporting purposes to maximize public health surveillance and research capabilities.",

Infection control procedures and equipment or medication shortages related to COVID-19 are significantly impacting the timing of surgery, default approach to airway management, maintenance of anesthesia, and the setting in which postoperative monitoring occurs. Such rapidly developed policies are intended to protect anesthesia providers and other health care workers and to conserve critical resources, but is there a signal for patient harm associated with such sudden and profound changes in practice? Additionally, anesthesia departments are increasingly relying on the results of preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing to guide such policies. The efficacy of these screening systems (particularly when applied to asymptomatic patients or those in whom such a determination is not possible) is unknown but is of critical importance for airway management, for determining personal protective equipment requirements during anesthetic care, and for determining safe postoperative disposition. Collectively, surgical patients undergoing preoperative evaluation are poised to become the largest cohort of asymptomatic patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, and yet the power of this potential resource to broadly inform health care policy will likely go unutilized. Unexpected but fundamentally important aspects of this emerging disease, such as the large number of patients presenting for endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke, may be uncovered through coordinated approaches to discovery.19 Finally, there has been a rapid shift toward the use of anesthesia machines to meet surge demands for mechanical ventilation. Reasonable evidence exists to suggest that modern anesthesia machines are virtually indistinguishable from intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators; however, ICU ventilators are more fault tolerant, handle circuit leaks more optimally, and handle fresh gas in very different ways. Anesthesia machines set improperly and operated by health care providers unfamiliar with their use may unnecessarily waste medical gases or (in the worst case) deliver hypoxic gas mixtures in the context of inadequate oxygen flow into the circle system. Again, the impact of such a rapid retasking of medical equipment will, under the current infrastructure, remain unknown for much longer than should be necessary.",

Better data are required to delineate every aspect of this pandemic: supporting local operations and quality work; informing research queries, such as investigations into provider risk following airway management and quantifying the efficacy of therapeutic options; and bolstering public health efforts by providing real-time prevalence, tracking disease spread, and facilitating risk stratification. Integration of health care data with nonhealthcare source data is currently an impossibility in the United States due to lack of a universal health care identifier.22 Public funding agencies and their grantees have shouldered the burden of creating stopgap solutions that policymakers have failed to require and major EHR vendors have avoided due to risk of competitive disadvantage. Policymakers and funders are called upon to prioritize the modernization of health informatics. Anesthesiologists and our specialty societies are called upon to advocate policymakers for these changes and to involve themselves in these organizations in the coming months and years and contribute to development or otherwise risk failing again in optimizing a data-driven response to the next pandemic.",
