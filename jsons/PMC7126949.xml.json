For example, a retrospective study of CT findings in HCT recipients found that those infected with RSV were more likely to have an airway-centric pattern of disease with tree-in-bud opacities and bronchial wall thickening with or without consolidation. Adenovirus appeared as multifocal consolidation or ground-glass opacities without inflammatory airway findings.37 Although these features may be suggestive, they are not highly specific.",

The viruses most frequently associated with LRTI include influenza virus, PIV, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Risk factors associated with the development of LRTI include older age, lymphopenia, early post-transplant infection, myeloablative conditioning regimen, unmatched donor status, and conditions, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), necessitating increased immunosuppression.2, 5 Variations in host immune status, through modulation of molecular and cellular response to infection, provide explanation for differences in clinical manifestation.

Serologic testing has limited application given that reinfection is common over time and because humoral responses to viral infections are often not detectable or significantly impaired in the immunocompromised host. Reliance on viral culture is hampered by prolonged turnaround time as well as the abandonment of cell vial culture techniques by clinical laboratories, typically in favor of molecular techniques. That said, viral culture does allow for strain typing and is relevant to allow for characterization of point mutations associated with antiviral drug resistance. Antigen detection by enzyme-based immunoassays are available for some respiratory viruses but lack sufficient sensitivity, particularly for influenza.39, 40\n",

In comparison with other methodologies, PCR offers more rapid turnaround time, higher sensitivity, and the ability to test for multiple viruses in a single test with multiplex platforms.39, 41, 42 The ability to detect multiple pathogens based on specific primers has revolutionized molecular diagnostics, allowing for panel-based testing driven by clinical syndrome.43 An important caveat of the high sensitivity of PCR is the detection of virus in the asymptomatic patient, which can represent subclinical infection, asymptomatic shedding, or a false-positive test result. PCR can be performed on various specimen types (eg, nasopharyngeal [NP] washes or swabs, oropharyngeal swab, and bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] samples). The positive and negative predictive values of NP specimens were 86% and 94%, respectively, when compared with BAL specimens, in a study of paired NP and BAL PCR testing in HCT and HM patients with LRTI.44 Various studies have used quantitative viral load on respiratory and other specimens as a correlate of disease severity to predict outcomes and to gauge response to treatment.45, 46 That said, the practical clinical applications of quantitative PCR are limited at this time. One important exception to this is adenovirus infection, in which case viremia can predict risk for disseminated and end-organ disease as well as survival.47 Although not yet the realm of routine clinical diagnostics, next-generation sequencing techniques, such as whole-genome sequencing, hold potential for better informing RVI outbreak investigations (for example, in the health care setting) than traditional PCR-based diagnostic platforms.48\n",

Delayed administration has been shown to increase progression to LRTI and is associated with worse outcomes than early administration.45, 71 Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the first-line agents for treatment of influenza A or influenza B. The currently available NAIs in the United States include oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and intravenous peramivir. The standard dose of oseltamivir for treatment of influenza is 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. There are no data to support the use of high-dose oseltamivir rather than standard dose.71 The optimal treatment duration in the HCT and HM population is not clear, and prospective trials to address this important question are needed. A longer duration of treatment (eg, 10 days) can be considered given the prolonged shedding and the risk for reactivation after remission, particularly with occurrence of infection in the pre-engraftment period.72 The potential benefit of a longer course of antiviral therapy must be balanced against the concern and risk for emergence of resistance in this population. From the era of pandemic H1N1 in 2009, the preponderance of patients with emergence of oseltamivir-resistant virus (H275Y mutation, conferring cross-resistance to peramivir but not to zanamivir) were severely immunocompromised, mainly in HM patients and HCT recipients.73, 74, 75\n",

Receipt of influenza vaccine has been associated not only with a decreased risk for influenza infection in HCT recipients but also with a decrease in influenza severity and complications if infection occurs despite vaccination.7 In a 5-year prospective observational study, allogeneic HCT recipients who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination had a significantly lower prevalence of virologically confirmed influenza infection (36% of vaccinated compared with 51% of nonvaccinated recipients; odds ratio [OR] 0.39), a decreased risk for progression to LRTI (OR 0.12) and a lower likelihood of influenza-related hospitalization compared with the nonvaccinated state.29 All individuals greater than 6 months of age without contraindication, including HCT recipients and HM patients, should receive the influenza vaccination annually. Vaccination at less than 6 months post-transplant has been demonstrated to result in poor immune response,86 and 2 doses of the influenza vaccine does not confer superior immunity compared with 1 dose.87 As such, standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for HCT recipients greater than or equal to 6 months post-transplant88 and as early as 3 months to 4 months after transplant in patients without GVHD or otherwise requiring immune suppression89 or during community outbreaks.90 Live attenuated influenza vaccine is not recommended for HCT recipients or other immunocompromised hosts or for their close contacts.90 Pretransplant vaccination (\u22652 weeks prior to conditioning) is recommended largely as a strategy to provide early post-transplant protection, although acknowledging seroprotection declines rapidly in the post-transplant setting.91 Given the vulnerability of this population and the suboptimal response to vaccination in the setting of immune compromise, vaccination of close contacts and health care workers is a critical arm of prevention.90, 92 HM patients receiving intensive chemotherapy or who have received anti\u2013B-cell antibodies (eg, rituximab) in the preceding 6 months are unlikely to respond to influenza vaccination.90\n",

No patients who lacked all of these risk factors progressed to LRTI, whereas the progression risk increased to greater than 30% if 3 or more risk factors were present.64 The need for mechanical ventilation in those with LRTI was 43% and survival from onset of mechanical ventilation was 23%. Although overall mortality with PIV LRTI is high after transplant, mortality decreases with time from transplant.11 PIV-associated mortality is widely variable but is reported to be as high as 50% in those with copathogens (see Table 1).12\n",

Cidofovir, a nucleotide analog that inhibits DNA polymerase, is active against all serotypes of adenovirus, with both in vitro and animal data demonstrating virologic and clinical activity, respectively.121 The human data supporting cidofovir for treatment of adenovirus infection in HCT recipients draw largely on retrospective studies demonstrating lower mortality rates in treated compared with untreated patients.122, 126 Pharmacologic disadvantages of cidofovir include active excretion of the unchanged drug in urine with resultant nephrotoxicity and low bioavailability, with limited concentration of the active phosphorylated compound in infected cells.126 Furthermore, toxicities of cidofovir are often dose limiting\u2014mainly nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression, and ocular toxicity. Brincidofovir, an oral lipid ester of cidofovir with improved bioavailability and a better safety profile, is an investigational agent under study for the treatment of adenovirus infection in HCT recipients. Although uncontrolled series have suggested efficacy and tolerability of brincidofovir in treating adenovirus viremia and disease in HCT recipients,130, 131 a randomized placebo-controlled phase II trial failed to meet the primary endpoint of reduction in treatment failure and demonstrated a signal for diarrhea in the group assigned to brincidofovir.132 Although there are in vitro data to suggest that ribavirin has activity against adenovirus, in vivo data have not borne out clinical utility.22, 133 Clearance of viremia and survival are highly associated with lymphocyte reconstitution.134 With this in mind, adoptive T-cell transfer of adenovirus-specific donor T cells remains an area of active investigation.122 That said, despite well over a decade of work on adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, this approach is far from routine for clinical application. In concert with consideration of antiviral treatment of serious adenovirus infection in HCT recipients, decrease in immune suppression as able also should be entertained.124\n",

In a large contemporary study of symptomatic HM patients with HRV infection, approximately 30% presented with LRTI.27 Only 5% of those who presented at the URTI stage progressed to LRTI within 30 days, suggesting that symptomatic LRTI is uncommon. As with all RVIs and for HRV especially, it is likely that many studies overestimate the LRTI rate because they fail to account for the greater tendency of patients to seek medical care in the setting of more severe illness. Although some studies have found an association between HRV severity and LRTI and species type,147 this is not a consistent finding.27 Coinfection is common, particularly with LRTI, which makes interpretation of attributable morbidity and mortality challenging.26, 27, 148 In a large retrospective study of approximately 700 HCT recipients with HRV infection spanning more than 2 decades, the overall 90-day mortality in the 128 subjects with LRTI was 41% and was significantly associated with low monocyte count, oxygen requirement at diagnosis, and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/d before diagnosis; survival was not affected by the presence of copathogens.26 As with other RVIs, early post-transplant infection is associated with greater disease severity.149 There is no specific antiviral treatment of HRV infection.",
