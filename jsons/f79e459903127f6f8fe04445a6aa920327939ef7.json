We are dealing here with a sensory system whose receptive field is situated in the upper part of the nose and whose information is taken up and transmitted via a CNS protrusion, the olfactory nerves, or olfactory bulb. This sensory function essentially serves the purpose of self-preservation by enabling individuals to recognize food, assess its quality, and receive warning signals (burnt smell, poisons). The stimulus threshold is extremely low in humans, and yet humans are poor smellers compared with animals. The stimulus threshold varies considerably according to the nutritional status.",

The olfactory system exerts an essential part of its influence on subcortical centers like the limbic system. Thus, smell has a high emotional component, which accounts for its great social importance. This explains why olfactory impressions are used to express behavior patterns in all languages. In German, for example, the expression Ich kann Dich nicht riechen (I cannot smell you) means 'I don't like you. ' Humans have special inherited and acquired preferences (hedonics). Thus, for example, the smell of a forest elicits a positive emotion in many people, whereas negative feelings are associated with the smell of isobutyric acid (sweat).",

Its purpose lies in the perception of pheromones within the sexual sphere and thus in the propagation of the species as well as in signaling and controlling aggressions. While hormones distribute messages within the body, pheromones take over communication to the outside (Jellinek). Little is known about the neuronal pathways and connections of the vomeronasal system. An intensive and exclusively subcortical process is probably involved, which means that we are not consciously aware of the stimulation of this organ. As with the classical olfactory sense, marked hedonics also exist here that are controlled by the immunological system.",

It covers an area of about 5 cm on either side of the nose, specifically in the region of the superior nasal conchae, the septum and the ethmoid bone ( Fig. 1) . This region harbors about 100 million bipolar olfactory cells in humans (220 million in dogs). The sensory epithelium also contains stem cells with the lifelong capacity for replacing olfactory cells that have died. The peripheral processes of the bipolar sensory cells rise to the mucosal surface (Fig. 2) . They bear up to 1,000 hairs (cilia) on which the primary contact takes place between aromatic molecules and receptors. The hairs differ in length among the various organisms. The longer the hairs, the more points of contact for the aromatic molecules. Organisms with long sensory hairs are therefore described as macrosmatic, those with short ones as microsmatic. The hairs must be moistened constantly so as not to be destroyed by desiccation. The olfactory zone thus has special mucous glands which, in contrast to other glands in the nose, do not form proteolytic enzymes. Odorants would otherwise be broken down into substances with a different smell prior to contact with the sensory cells.",

They can be positive or negative but differ from organism to organism and also among members of the same species. Thus, the smell of decay is negative for humans but positive for vultures. Europeans value the smell of pizza spices more highly than that of soybean oil. The opposite is true for Asians. Hedonics can be inherited (smell of decay) and acquired and are already passed on during gestation. Fetuses are known to react to olfactory stimuli in the mother after the 28th week of pregnancy. Thus, newborn rabbits already show a selective preference for the food their mothers preferred.",

            "text": "The literature on the anatomy and physiology of the vomeronasal organ in humans is extensive and in part extremely controversial. Thus, Shoyi et al. found that the vomeronasal system has very high sensitivity to various stimulating substances, though the sensory cells in the nasal pouch do not possess distinct cilia like the olfactory cells of the classic olfactory system. In contrast, Smith and Bhatnagor (2000) already detected a transformation into ciliated cells in infancy. On the one hand, a physiological receptor function has been negated in man (Trotier et al. 2000) . On the other hand, women randomized in a double-blind manner reacted specifically to the male pheromone androstadienone when applied to their vomeronasal organ in picogram quantities. Direct application of the female pheromone pregna-4,20-diene-3,6-dione (vomeropherin PDD) to the vomeronasal organ of men elicited a significant and dose-dependent parasympathomimetic reaction and also decreased serum LH and testosterone (Monti-Bloch et al. 1998 ). The threshold for pheromone detection is extremely low in animals. Hence, a male silk moth will find a female even at a distance of 10 km, though not if it is sitting under a glass bell. As mentioned above, the stimulating substances of the vomeronasal system are pheromones, androstenone, and androstenol being among those found in humans. They are formed in the nasolabial groove, the axilla, the mammillae and the sexual organs. We do not perceive consciously their stimulation of the vomeronasal organ. If we think we are smelling pheromones, these are bacterial breakdown products of the respective substances, for which we also develop marked hedonics. Famous in this connection is a letter Napoleon wrote to his wife, Josephine, requesting that she no longer wash herself because he was coming home from the field.",

Hedonics has been found to undergo a reversal in the course of pregnancy, during which time a previously preferred partner is not very attractive. This effect is biologically understandable.

Following Weber, Michels argued that the differentiation of an organizational elite from the rank-and-file was a product of the technical division of labor necessary in complex mass organizations. Weber's pessimistic analysis of the 'iron cage' of modern rationality was reflected in Michels' own pessimism about the dilemma faced by the party rank-and-file: the benefits of bureaucratic organization were manifold, but could only be realized by forsaking popular sovereignty. Weber also argued that the 'routinization of charisma' that led to modern bureaucratic organization was driven by the concerns of the administrative staff to secure and stabilize their position. In Michels' argument, the conservative tendency of organizational elites stems from their concern to maintain their status and livelihood.",

Thus, Michels moves back and forth from arguing that oligarchy is explained by the masses' adoration of and gratitude towards their leaders to arguing that it is explained by elites' ability to co-opt dissent through control over patronage and the media. The tension can be highlighted as follows: despite the leaders' subversion of the revolutionary goals and democratic aspirations of the masses, the masses remain grateful and obedient.",

Pareto and Mosca drew a sharp distinction between the elites and the masses and argued that the competence and energy of the elites made it possible for them to rule the unenterprising masses. Influenced by Le Bon's study of the irrationality of crowds, Michels argued that the masses are weakly organized and hence politically immature and even incompetent. Unable to organize themselves, the masses have a strong need for leadership. The relatively strong emphasis on psychological factors in Political Parties-such as the argument that the masses have 'a need to pay adoring worship' to their leaders -seems to derive from Le Bon (though we cannot forget Weber's analysis of charisma). The psychological distance between elites and masses leads the rank-and-file to behave in a deferential way towards their leaders.",

With their monopoly over the means of production (organization), the elite is essentially able to extract surplus rents from the social movement. He analyzes the organizational differentiation of elites and masses as a process of embourgeoisement. Even (or especially) leaders of proletarian origin become culturally, educationally, and financially differentiated from their original social class and consequently lose all fraternal feeling towards the working class.",
