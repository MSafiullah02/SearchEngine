Predicting users\u2019 behaviour, interactions, and influence are of interest due to their wide range of applications such as personalized recommendations and marketing campaigns. Community-level analytics provide the means to understand social network dynamics at a higher collective level. In order to support community-level models, various community detection methods have been proposed, which employ information such as users\u2019 social connections and content engagement to identify communities. The objective of these models is to identify past and current user communities; however, little work has been done on community prediction, that is, to determine how the community structure of a social network will look like in a future yet-to-be-observed time interval.",

Such models endeavor to learn low-rank latent space representations based on the intuition that nodes can move in latent space over time. While suitable for predicting links in a social network, dynamic link prediction models are inherently deficient when the communities need to take users\u2019 content similarity into account, i.e., identify content-based user communities in the future. Temporal content-based user community prediction is of interest due to the following reasons: (i) there are many users on a social network that have similar interests but are not explicitly linked to each other, (ii) an explicit social link does not necessarily indicate user interest similarity but could be owing to sociological processes such as conformity, sociability or other factors such as friendship and kinship [10, 28], (iii) there are some cases where the network structure is not accessible [4] or misleading, e.g., when links are fraudulent due to link-farming [21], and (iv) empirical research has shown that link evolution happens at a much lower pace compared to content changes [24], particularly because links are often not removed when they become effectively \u2018dead\u2019.",

However, users\u2019 temporal content is only used for pairwise user similarity calculation to build content-based user communities as opposed to user community prediction. As a result, they have limited applicability for identifying user communities of the future. Regression techniques such as autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) and support vector regression (svr) that leverage temporal information to predict users\u2019 future interests have shown promising results and can be utilized to identify user communities in the future based on users\u2019 pairwise content similarity [3].

First, contrary to non-temporal methods [31\u201333], our approach incorporates temporality. Second, in contrast to Zhu et al.\u2019s method [34] and the likes [11, 14, 27, 35] that focus on dynamics of social network structure, our approach employs dynamics of social content. Third, although we use temporal information to predict future users\u2019 topical interests similar to regression methods, we train only one model for all users and, thus, significantly reduce computational cost compared to regression techniques. Last, unlike Fani et al. [12] and Hu et al. [18] who employ users\u2019 temporal and topical interests for performing pairwise user similarities in order to identify user communities up until \u2018now\u2019, our work in this paper employs such information for predicting user communities \u2018in the future\u2019, which is a step forward compared to the state of the art. We perform experiments on a Twitter corpus and compare our work for user community prediction with several state-of-the-art baselines in the context of news recommendation and user prediction. The results show that our method, which incorporates the temporal evolution of users\u2019 topics of interest within latent space, exhibits a stronger predictive power compared to the baselines.",

More recently, several effective approaches have been proposed which integrate both the network structure (links) and content to improve community detection performance [1, 7].

            "text": "From among the work that consider temporality, Hu et al. [18] have proposed a probabilistic generative model jointly over text, time and links, namely community level diffusion (cold), to simultaneously identify both user communities and topics in order to uncover inter-community influence dynamics. The generative process can be summarized in three steps. First, per community topic distribution is sampled according to Dirichlet. Then for each community-topic pair, temporal distribution (timestamp) of a topic for a community is also sampled according to Dirichlet. Finally, a user chooses a community based on her community membership distribution and selects a topic from the community according to the community\u2019s topic distribution to generate a post (e.g., a tweet). The time of the post is from the temporal distribution of that topic for that community. Contrary to the unified generative model, Fani et al. [12] have proposed a neural embedding approach to identify temporally like-minded user communities given the user generated textual content. They model the users\u2019 temporal contribution towards topics of interest by introducing the notion of regions of like-mindedness between users. These regions cover users who share not only similar topical interests but also similar temporal behaviour. By considering the identified set of regions of like-mindedness as a context, a neural network is trained such that the probability of a user in a region is maximized given other users in the same region. The final weights of the neural networks form the low-dimensional vector representation of each user that incorporates both topics of interest and their temporal nature. Finally, a graph partitioning technique is applied on a weighted user graph in which the similarity of two users is based on the cosine similarity of their respective vectors to identify like-minded user communities. While both of these works sketch different architectures to incorporate temporality, they have shown performance improvement in modelling content-based user communities, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as item recommendation. However, in both work, users\u2019 temporal content is only used to build user communities up until now and have limited applicability for identifying user communities of the future.",

            "text": "Temporal latent space modeling aims at learning the evolution of a temporal graph node and/or an edge over time into a dynamic low dense d-dimensional vector in latent space which is allowed to modify its position in the latent space over time. This can be employed for different underlying applications such as link prediction and node classification [13]. Various works such as Temporal tensor-factorization [11, 34], and neural embeddings [14, 27, 35] have been proposed in this respect. For instance, Singer et al. [27] extend the prior neural-based embedding approaches on static graphs, e.g., node2vec [15], to temporal graphs. They propose a semi-supervised algorithm, namely tNodeEmbed, that learns to combine a node\u2019s historical temporal embeddings into a final embedding such that it can optimize for a given underlying task, e.g., link prediction. tNodeEmbed initializes node embeddings for time interval t using a static node embedding method. Since initialization for each time interval happens in isolation and independently, the coordinates of the embeddeding space are not guaranteed to align. tNodeEmbed learns a rotation matrix to align coordinates of node embeddings within the time intervals given the fact that a node\u2019s temporal behaviour between two consecutive time intervals is gradual and does not follow a bursty pattern (temporal smoothness). Each node embedding at time t, after alignment, is fed to a recurrent neural network (rrn) with long short term memory (lstm) to output the final temporal embedding of the node by optimizing for the specific task. Zhu et al. [34], however, propose temporal latent space modeling for the task of dynamic link prediction via non-negative matrix factorization followed by a scalable inference algorithm based on block coordinate gradient descent (bcgd) to obtain embeddings in linear time.",

As such, well-defined quality measures such as rand index or normalized mutual information (nmi) that require comparison to the gold standard cannot be used. On the other hand and in the absence of a golden standard, quality functions such as modularity are not helpful either since they are based on the explicit links between users. In our approach and the baselines, the links between the users are inferred through a learning process and are not explicit. For instance, a near perfect method may result in low modularity because graph edges are sparse and do not form densely connected user sets. Conversely, a weak method may connect topically dissimilar users together forming communities of users that do not share similar interests but have a high modularity.

For instance, Hu et al. is neither a predictive model nor aware of temporal similarity among users, and Ye et al. and Louvain do not take temporal information into account at all.

Here, given the user communities of the future, the goal is to predict which users will post news article a at time T + 1. To do so, we consider members of the closest community to a news article in terms of topics of interest at time T + 1 to be the potential posters. We use precision, recall, and f-measure to report user prediction performance. We further compare our method at its best which happens to be at d = 80, against the baselines at their best setting in Table 1. In terms of precision, our proposed method was able to outperform other baselines. In terms of recall; however, some of the baselines could achieve higher performance and our method is not as strong. The reason for such high recall for some baselines is the fact that the they cluster users into very few, yet large user communities, as seen in Fig. 2. For instance, rrn was able to excel in recall due to its low number of communities. In an extreme, if a method only identifies one community that includes all of the users, recall would be 1. As such the lower the number of the communities is, the higher the recall would be. However, this comes at the cost of precision. Overall, the f-measure metric points to higher quality communities identified based on our proposed work. This reinforces the fact that when users\u2019 pairwise similarity with respect to the topics of interest over time are explicitly embedded in a sequence of graphs, it will lead to higher quality user communities in the future. Further, Fig. 2 shows that unlike some of the baselines where the majority of the users are placed in only a few communities and the other communities only have a few members (leading to higher recall but poor performance on precision), our approach could proportionally distribute users across different communities and hence show superior performance over precision and f-measure.\n",

The area that we would like to work on in our future work pertains to the fact that our approach penalizes significant and sudden changes in the position of a user\u2019s representations in latent space. In other words, our approach favors smooth transition of user representations across different time intervals. However, there may be cases where sudden change in the position of the user representation in latent space may be warranted such as in reaction to bursty topics.
