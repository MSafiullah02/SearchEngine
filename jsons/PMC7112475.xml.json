This\nmakes them important predictors of epidemic threshold of infectious diseases that propagate\nwithin real world complex network. Indeed, the recent demonstration that these eigenvalues are\nensemble averageable has provided further support for this view. In this paper, we study into\nthe ensemble averageability of extreme eigenvalues through a new perspective: the connection\nbetween multimodal network and scale-free network. The discrete nature of the multimodal\nnetwork has allowed us to arrive at an improved analytical expression of the extreme\neigenvalue for scale-free networks. The extreme eigenvalues calculated from our analytical\nexpression are found to closely correspond to those obtained numerically, thus making\nsignificant improvement over earlier versions. The implication is a more accurate estimate of\nepidemic threshold, which is important for the elucidation of how vulnerable a particular\nnetwork structure is to epidemic spreading. Our results are also applicable to the evaluation\nof strategies that aim to contain the spread of infectious diseases through the adjustment of\nthe topology of network structures.",

In particular, scale-free networks have been widely used\nto describe and model diverse social, biological, and economic systems.1\u20135 In an ensemble of scale-free networks, it is\nknown that the degree distribution of the nodes remains invariant. However, the topological\nstructure can be distinct with different connection arrangements between the nodes in each\nnetwork configuration. Such structural diversity can lead to discrepancies in the dynamics of\nindividual network. Since the structural influences on certain dynamical processes are\ngoverned by the extreme eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrices,6\u201313 deviations in the extreme\neigenvalues in network ensembles are of increasing interest in deciphering the underlying\nstructural changes. Recently, it was found that the extreme eigenvalues of adjacency matrices,\ndespite fluctuating wildly in an ensemble of scale-free networks, are well characterized by\nthe ensemble average after being normalized by functions of the maximum degrees.14 Specifically, it had been proven that the\nprobability of having a large variation in extreme eigenvalues in the ensemble diminishes as\nthe size of the network increases. Considering the rich assortment of possible structural\nconfigurations of scale-free networks in an ensemble, this averageability is significant as it\nimplies that dynamical processes which are governed by the extreme eigenvalues can be simply\ndescribed by means of the ensemble average without the need to incorporate the connection\ndetails of the individual network. In particular, the average ability of a network to\nsynchronize and its mean epidemic spreading threshold are shown to be well approximated by\nfunctions of the ensemble average of the eigenvalues. Therefore, finding a way to determine\nthe ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalues becomes crucial in uncovering the topological\ninfluences of the network structure on a number of network dynamical processes.",

            "text": "Let us begin with a brief introduction of multimodal networks. In Ref. 19, a multimodal network with m modes is shown to contain\nm distinct peaks, which is exemplified by the degree distribution:\nP(k)=\u2211i=1mri\u03b4(k-ki). Note that\n\u03b4(x) is the Dirac\u2019s delta function. The\ndiscrete degrees of the network are ki=k1b-(i-1) with\ni=1,2,\u2026,m.\nIn addition, the fraction of nodes of degree ki\nis ri=r1a-(i-1). It is assumed that\na>1\nand 0<b<1\nsuch that the degree distribution of the multimodal network follows a power law:\nP(ki)=ri\u221dki-\u03b2.\nHence, r1>r2>\u2026>rm\nfor k1<k2<\u2026<km.\nAs m\u2192\u221e,\nthe multimodal network converges to a scale-free network. The largest degree of the network is\nkm,\nthe smallest degree is k1\nwhich is between 1 and \u27e8k\u27e9,\nand we have b=(k1/km)1m-1.\nFinally, the rest of the parameters are determined through the following equations:\n\u2211i=1mri=r1\u2211i=1ma-(i-1)=1,(1)\n\u2211i=1mkiri=k1r1\u2211i=1m(ab)-(i-1)=\u27e8k\u27e9.(2)We\nfollow the method outlined in Ref. 20 to find the\nmaximum eigenvalue \u03bbH\nof the network after we have determined all the parameters of the multimodal network. Let\nG be a graph with vertices described by the set V(G)={v1,v2,\u2026,vm}; and let\nA represents the adjacency matrix. For each positive integer\nn, the number of different vj\u2192vi\nwalk of length n, denoted by yj\u2192i(n), is the ( j,\ni)th-entry in the matrix An.\nNote that two u\u2192v\nwalks: W=(u=u0,u1,\u2026,uk=v) and\nW'=(u=v0,v1,\u2026,vl=v), in a graph are\nequal if k = l and ui=vi\nfor all i, with 0\u2264i\u2264k.21 For example, W1=(v0,v1,v0,v2) is different from\nW2=(v0,v2,v0,v2) and both should be\nincluded in the calculation of y0\u21922(3). In other words,\nyj\u2192i(n) is the total number of all possible\nwalks of length n from node j to i,\nincluding those that go backwards. Take a fully connected network with 3 nodes as an example,\nthere are 3 walks of length 3 from node 1 to node 2, i.e., 1\u21922\u21921\u21922,1\u21923\u21921\u21922\nand 1\u21922\u21923\u21922.\nThis corresponds to (A3)12=3.\nIn the eigen-decomposed form, we have An=vDnv',\nwhere v is a square matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of\nA, and v'\ndenotes the inverse of v. D is the diagonal matrix whose\ndiagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues, i.e., Dll=\u03bbl.\nHence, yj\u2192i(n)=(An)ji=\u2211l\u03bblnvj,lv'l,i.(3)Note\nthat Eq. (3) gives a summation over the\nnth power of the eigenvalues. When n is sufficiently\nlarge, the nth power of \u03bbH\ndominates over the nth power of each of the remaining eigenvalues. Therefore,\nyj\u2192i(n) can be simply approximated by\n\u03bbH\nas follow: yj\u2192i(n)\u2248\u03bbHnvj,Hv'H,i.(4)Now,\nif we were to consider the number of walks of length n + 2 which start and\nend at node H,\nyH\u2192H(n+2)=yH\u2192H(n)yH\u2192H(2)+\u2211j\u2260HyH\u2192j(n)yj\u2192H(2),(5)then\naccording to Eq. (4), \u03bbH2\u2248yH\u2192H(2)+\u2211j\u2260HyH\u2192j(n)yj\u2192H(2)yH\u2192H(n).(6)The\nfirst term on the right hand side of Eq. (6)\ncorresponds to the number of nearest neighbors of node H, i.e., the largest\ndegree of the network, kH.\nIn Ref. 20, the second term on the right hand side of\nEq. (6) is shown to be very small numerically\nfor scale-free networks and is hence neglected. Since we are interested in finding a better\napproximation to the ensemble average of the maximum eigenvalues, we retain the second term\nand evaluate it by means of a statistical approach.",

Here, we set k1=\u27e8k\u27e9/2\nand km=\u27e8k\u27e9N.\nFigure 2 shows the ensemble average of the extreme\neigenvalues for multimodal networks with m modes. It is observed that\n\u27e8\u03bbH\u27e9\nis the largest for bimodal network. It decreases gradually as m increases and\neventually converges to a finite value. In consequence, the epidemic threshold for bimodal\nnetwork is lower than that of the scale-free network, since the epidemic threshold is\ninversely proportional to the extreme eigenvalue. Thus, although it had been shown in Ref.\n19 that bimodal network is optimal in terms of its\ntolerance against both random and targeted removal of nodes, epidemic spreading in this\nnetwork is found to be less controllable.",

When dealing with network dynamics such as the epidemic spreading of the\ncommunity-acquired meticilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA)\nsuperbugs that are resistant to many antibiotics,33 such an over-estimation of the epidemic threshold can lead to serious\nconsequences. In view of this, the analytical solution derived from the multimodal network\nwhich is able to provide closer approximation to the ensemble average of extreme eigenvalue of\nscale-free network is important. We have demonstrated that our analytical approximation\npredicted accurately the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalues for scale-free networks\nwith \u03b2\u22483\nand km=N\u27e8k\u27e9.\nIn fact, Eq.
