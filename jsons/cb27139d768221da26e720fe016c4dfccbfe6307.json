The term cytokines includes interleukins (IL-), chemokines, growth factors, interferons (IFN), colony stimulating factors (CSF), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF).

The cytokine release syndrome associated for example with OKT3 administration is similar to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. During systemic inflammatory response syndrome, it has been observed that even in the absence of systemic hypotension, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) can occur. Certain cytokines released during systemic inflammatory response syndrome mediate peripheral vasodilation in the absence of systemic hypotension. The renal response to peripheral vasodilation is vasoconstriction of the renal vasculature and reduced renal blood flow. TNF-\u03b1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. TNF-\u03b1 stimulates the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and regulates genes coding for other inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2). The major cellular sources of TNF-\u03b1 are monocytes and T cells but upon injury, renal tubular cells start also to produce TNF-\u03b1 as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines [1] [2] [3] leading to an amplification of the inflammatory responses. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 have also been shown to induce glomerular endothelial and mesangial cell production of vasoconstricting mediators like platelet activating factor (PAF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and adenosine, but also of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2. Local release of TNF-\u03b1 reduces glomerular blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, induces the synthesis of other proinflammatory mediators, and, along with reactive oxygen species, increases glomerular albumin permeability. Pro-inflammatory cytokines recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the kidney and enhance their adhesion to endothelial cells.",

Very high doses of systemic TNF can cause thrombotic microangiopahy as observed by Bertani in an experimental rabbit model. He showed that an intravenous TNF infusion did induce glomerular endothelial damage, neutrophil accumulation, and fibrin deposition within capillary lumens [4] .

The authors described an illness that developed in some patients after administration of horse serum that had been given as an antitoxin for the treatment of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Serum sickness is characterized by fever, rash, arthralgias, and eventually glomerulonephritis. Serum sickness is the prototypic example of the Coombs 'type III' or immune complex mediated hypersensitivity disease. The disease requires the presence of the antigen coincident with antibodies directed against the antigen, leading to the formation of antigen-antibody or immune complexes. These should normally be cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system. If this system is not functioning well or is saturated by the immune complex load, then excess immune complexes may form in the circulation and deposit in tissues, or form directly in the involved tissues. The deposition of antigen-antibody (immune) complexes in tissues triggers the activation of the complement cascade, recruitment of leukocytes, and release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine. Classic serum sickness can occur after injections of chimeric monoclonal antibodies but a variety of drugs can also cause reactions that clinically resemble classical serum sickness, but are believed to be caused by different mechanisms. In most cases, the specific mechanism is not known.",

Similarly to idiopathic lupus, drug-induced lupus can be divided into systemic, sub-acute cutaneous and chronic cutaneous lupus. The syndrome is characterized by arthralgia, myalgia, pleurisy, rash and fever in association with antinuclear antibodies in the serum. The clinical and laboratory manifestations of drug-induced SLE are similar to those of idiopathic SLE, but central nervous system and renal involvement are rare in drug-induced lupus [7] . Blockade of TNF in human rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease led to the development of autoantibodies, lupus-like syndrome, and glomerulonephritis in some patients. These data raise concern about using TNF-blocking therapies in renal disease because the kidney may be especially vulnerable to the manifestation of autoimmune processes. Interestingly, recent experimental evidence suggests distinct roles for the 2 TNF receptors in mediating local inflammatory injury in the kidney and systemic immune-regulatory functions [8] .",

However, measurement of ionized calcium and urinary calcium demonstrated true hypocalcemia and hypocalciuria. There was an associated hypomagnesemia and hypomagnesurea, hypophosphatemia, hypophosphaturea. Primary hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis were thought to have caused an increased binding to albumin and intracellular shifts of these ions. Likewise, severe hypophosphatemia can be seen in gram negative sepsis in association with respiratory alkalosis. All patients developed a compensatory metabolic acidosis due to chronic hyperventilation. Respiratory alkalosis was thought to have developed because of capillary leak into the lungs producing borderline or frank pulmonary edema. After several days a superimposed normal anion gap acidosis developed from dilution by large volumes of saline fluid resuscitation.

Nephrotoxicity however, was more common in patients receiving IL-2 than in those receiving IFN-\u03b1. Interestingly, Schomburg [19] demonstrated that palliative low to intermediate-dose of IL-2 in combination with IFN-\u03b1 therapy was less nephrotoxic and less vasculo-toxic, especially if given subcutaneously rather than intravenously.

Two studies reported the onset of a nephrotic syndrome during treatment with IFN\u03b1. The nephrotic syndrome reversed after treatment was withdrawn [34, 40] . Herman [41] published a report of a patient with hairy cell leukemia who developed mesangio-capillary GN during treatment with IFN\u03b1. He developed hematuria, pyuria, and depressed complements. Colovic reported a patient with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML and nephrotic syndrome in whom renal insufficiency developed after the onset of IFN\u03b1 treatment [42] . A renal biopsy showed the characteristics of mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. In spite of the discontinuation of treatment, renal function deteriorated and the patient died six months after the onset of the symptoms. Averbuch [43] reported a patient with Mycosis Fungoides who developed a minimal change nephropathy and acute interstitial nephritis after 6 doses of IFN\u03b1. After IFN\u03b1 was discontinued, renal function returned to normal, but low grade proteinuria persisted for 2 months. Rechallenge with IFN\u03b1 again produced azotemia and nephrotic range proteinuria. The authors suggested that activated cytotoxic T cells were responsible for a cell mediated delayed hypersensitivity mechanism of injury. Similar cases of minimal change disease associated with IFN\u03b1 were reported by Traynor et al [44] and Rettmar et al [45] . Shah et al reported 2 cases of renal failure associated with IFN\u03b1 treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Both patients had proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on biopsy [46] . Recently, two case reports were issued that concerned the occurrence of acute renal failure in patients that were treated with IFN\u03b1 for metastatic carcinoid tumors [47, 48] .

It is well known that hepatitis C virus infection can cause GN. Mesangiocapillary GN is the most common manifestation and biopsy specimens have shown deposition of immune complexes composed of hepatitis C virus-related antigen and cryoglobulin. The difficulty lies in distinguishing glomerulonephritis caused by hepatitis C from glomerulonephritis seen in association with IFN\u03b1 therapy or from occult underlying renal disease that is exacerbated by IFN\u03b1. There have been reports of nephrotic range proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on biopsy in patients who are being treated with IFN\u03b1 for hepatitis C [51, 52] . Gordon et al. [53] reported a case of IFN\u03b1 induced exacerbation of vasculitis (rash and renal impairment) in a patient with hepatitis C-associated cryoglobinulemia. Ohta et al. [54] examined 24 patients who manifested the appearance of or exacerbation of proteinuria after IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection. One patient had known hepatitis C-related glomerulopathy and cryoglobulinemia and showed a good response to therapy including improved renal function and remission of proteinuria. Yamabe et al. and also Sarac et al. confirmed good responses to IFN therapy without renal deterioration in patients with hepatitis C-related glomerulonephritis [55, 56] . In Ohta's study only 3 subjects were treated with IFN\u03b1, the remainder were treated with IFN\u03b2 . As was shown by Johnson [57] improvement in mesangiocapilarry GN with IFN\u03b1 correlated with clearance of viremia but did not correlate with remission of proteinuria. Other results were quite variable. The authors felt that absence (or minimal presence) of Hepatitis C core antigens or cryoglobulin deposits in the glomeruli indicated non-hepatitis C virus related or primary GN and that these patients might be at higher risk for exacerbation or direct injury from IFN. There was no clear explanation for which patients would benefit from or fail to respond to IFN and which patients might develop irreversible renal injury.",

Gordon described the case of a 54-year-old patient, who developed acute renal failure nine days after commencing treatment [60] . A renal biopsy showed ATN, and exacerbation of (probably pre-existent) IgA-nephropathy. After cessation of therapy, renal function was restored. In addition, Batisse described exacerbation of cryoglobulinemia-related vasculitis in one patient, following treatment of hepatitis C with peginterferon-\u03b1 [61] .

Open renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerosclerosis in 3 of 43 glomeruli and irregular wrinkling of the capillary walls in others. A tuft adhesion to Bowman's capsule was seen in one glomerulus. There was also diffuse tubular damage and interstitial edema consistent with acute tubular necrosis. Electron microscopy demonstrated foot process effacement. Direct immunofluoroscence was negative for IgG, IgA, IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, properdin, and fibrin reactive products. Renal function returned to normal after withdrawal of the drug. The authors suggested that structural distortion of the basement membrane and absence of immune complexes was evidence for direct glomerular injury by the cytokine. However the authors could not exclude prior sub-clinical focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in the child. To support their hypothesis, the authors cited studies in newborn Swiss mice exposed to mouse interferon in which there was diffuse glomerular basement membrane wrinkling and capillary IgG and C3 deposition which progressed to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.",

The immunosuppressive properties of OKT3 are related to its ability to deplete CD3+ T cells, to induce the internalization of the CD3-TCR complexes, and to sterically inhibit residual CD3-TCR complexes [69] . The ability of OKT3 to induce multivalent cross-linking of both the TCR-CD3 complexes and the monocyte Fc receptor results in T cell and monocyte activation [70] . This is accompanied by the systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-6 [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . This leads to a cytokine release syndrome similar to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This is associated with the development of a transient renal dysfunction [76] . In some cases renal biopsies were obtained at the time of renal dysfunction that showed only mild interstitial edema [77] . Beside the transient kidney dysfunction described above, OKT3 exerts pro-coagulant effects which can precipitate intragraft thromboses [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] .",

A trial in the treatment of Crohn's disease noted infusion reactions, transient increased of anti-dsDNA antibodies, and serum sickness-like delayed hypersensitivity with retreatment. Induction of human-antichimeric-antibodies was suggested as the cause of some of the infusion reactions [90] . A prospective study in 35 patients with Crohn's disease showed induction of ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in 53% and 35% of infliximabtreated patients [91] . A single patient showed clinical features consistent with drug-induced lupus, including the presence of ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, which quickly resolved after discontinuation of infliximab . Reports on renal adverse effects of anti-TNF antibodies are very rare. Saint Marcoux described the occurrence of crescentic GN in as few as 2 patients out of a cohort of 39 patients, treated with an anti-TNF antibody for rheumatoid arthritis [92] .

Anti-CD52-Ab is used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as induction therapy in renal transplantation and as a conditioning agent for bone marrow transplantation. Recently, a limited number of studies have been published that demonstrate possible renal adverse effects of anti-CD52-Ab . Bonatti reported the occurrence of hemolytic uremic syndrome in a renal transplant patient treated with Campath-1H [98] . In addition, Osborne described the case of a 37 year old woman who developed acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation following one dose of Campath-1H and Fludarabine , in preparation for bone marrow transplantation [99] . Campath-1H was thought to be the most likely causal agent although Fludarabine alone or in combination with Campath cannot be excluded. Renal function did not recover, requiring dialysis treatment up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. Recently, in a retrospective study in 443 renal transplant patients with biopsy-proven glomerular disease, the recurrence of glomerular disease under treatment with Campath-1H was studied [100] . In this study, the recurrence of biopsy-proven glomerular disease was similar in patients induced with Campath-1H or IL-2 receptor antagonists, while patients receiving antithymocyte antibody had a borderline lower recurrence rate than patients treated with other induction agents (P=0.047). Hill presented the rare case of a 38-yr-old renal transplant patient, who developed severe early acute humoral rejection, resulting in allograft loss after Campath-1H induction therapy [101] .",

IVIG modulates cytokine production and down-regulates IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF\u03b1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). However, flushing, myalgia, headache, fever, chills, wheezing, hypotension and tachycardia have been noted after the start of the infusion and have been attributed to activation of complement and the complement cascade. Reversible rises in serum creatinine occurred in 4/17 patients treated for ANCA-associated vasculitis [102] .",

Other studies have shown that intravenous immunoglobulin infusions are more likely to result in acute renal failure in the presence of underlying renal disease or with simultaneous use of certain other drugs such as non-steroidals and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.",
