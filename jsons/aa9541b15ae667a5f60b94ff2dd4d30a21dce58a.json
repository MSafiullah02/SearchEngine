Due to the need for physical distancing and isolation, universities closed and most medical clinics were ordered to continue with \"essential\" in-person visits only. In addition to a wave of medical appointment cancellations, many medical research activities, such as participant recruitment, study visits, and outcomes assessments were halted. In light of rapid societal change in response to the pandemic, this paper summarizes our considerations for conducting remote research. The discussion provided here is not exhaustive, but rather a starting place for a fundamental shift in how research is conducted.",

They have also been shown to provide opportunities for connecting with individuals with specific health conditions, living in remote geographic locations, or who may have been difficult to recruit due to stigma or medical mistrust [6, 7] . Some examples of social media to advertise and recruit participants include: social networks (such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter), dating apps (Grindr, Scruff, and Jack'd), and online listservs for various medical societies or health conditions. The main disadvantage of using social media for study recruitment is the lack of reach to those with limited or no internet access. This can result in reduced generalizability of research findings [7, 8] . Researchers concerned about generalizability, however, can supplement online advertisement with traditional methods.",

This can increase web traffic to the study website, decrease the workload for research staff, and increase a potential participant's trust in the legitimacy of the study (e.g. if the webpage is part of a reputable university with an \"edu\" domain). The main disadvantage of online screening is that it may either deter some to participate (e.g. if the form is too complicated or lengthy) or increase inappropriate participation (e.g. an individual or bot responding repeatedly to be eventually deemed eligible). One option to minimize these barriers is to include a simple pre-screening form on the study website and to contact the interested individual by phone call or text message to complete the screening process.",

This modality lends itself well to interventions that do not require physical contact but are enhanced by face-to-face communication, such as interventions for mental health, smoking cessation, and medication adherence counseling. Participants in prior studies noted high acceptability levels in using videochat for research intervention delivery [17] . Benefits included being able to speak more candidly and being less intimidated, and experiencing reduced barriers for research participation (e.g. financial barriers related to travel expenses or time off from work, stigma associated with research participation, and physical disabilities precluding mobility) [17, 18] . In addition to providing interventions, these platforms can be used for one-on-one qualitative interviews and focus groups. They allow for video-or audio-recording of the session (with consent from the participant) which can be used later for interview transcription and analysis. Other remote methods of delivering an intervention include mobile health applications [11] , computers-based programs [19] , and the internet [20] .",
