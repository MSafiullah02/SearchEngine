The subgenomic transcripts also contain a common 5\u02b9 leader sequence, which is derived from the 5\u02b9 end of the genomic RNA. Their synthesis involves a discontinuous transcription process that resembles similarity-assisted RNA recombination [1]. Transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) consisting of conserved hexanucleotide motif and poorly conserved flanking sequences forming secondary structures are present at the 3\u02b9 end of the common leader (leader TRS) and upstream of each structural protein gene (body TRSs), and play a key role in the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs [1], [2]. The body TRSs could act as attenuation signals during minus-strand RNA synthesis, and then the nascent minus strand would be redirected to the 5\u02b9-proximal region of the template by a base-pairing interaction between the leader TRS and the antisense copy of the body TRSs. Then the completed subgenomic-length minus strands would serve as templates for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs [1], [3].",

            "text": "Reverse genetics system provides a powerful tool to dissect the functions of viral proteins in viral life cycle and pathogenicity by gene manipulation. However, overlapped ORFs make it difficult to manipulate PRRSV genome [9]. Recently, PRRSV gene expression vectors capable of expressing a foreign gene from an additional transcription unit were generated by inserting a copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) [10], [11], [12], [13]. This novel approach was used to construct recombinant viruses expressing antiviral cytokines as adjuvants to overcome immune subversion of PRRSV and enhance the viral specific immune response following vaccination [13], or expressing reporter proteins to monitor virus replication, as well as elucidating the role of host factors and screening for novel antiviral drugs [11], [13]. This PRRSV reverse genetics system may also function as a vector for development of recombinant multivalent vaccines against swine diseases by encoding immunogenic antigens from other swine pathogens [10]. The inserted foreign gene was supposed to be tolerated by the virus and could be stably expressed in cell culture. In this study, a recombinant HP-PRRSV expressing an additional transcription unit (rHV-GFP) was constructed. RNA recombination resulted from the additional transcription unit insertion conferred high attenuation both in vitro and in vivo.\n",

In this study, we used 293FT cell line to rescue PRRSV. The full-length cDNA clone was transfected into 293FT cells and then the cell culture supernatant was passaged on PAMs. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that viable viruses (rHV) could be successfully rescued (Fig. 1B).

At 48 h post transfection, a high percentage of GFP-positive cells could be observed under an immunofluorescence microscope (Fig. 1C), indicating that 293FT cell is appropriate for PRRSV packaging.

            "text": "Various factors can influence RNA recombination, including the sequence similarity between the nascent and the acceptor nucleic acid molecules, the kinetics of transcription, and secondary structure in the RNA that may promote template switching through stalling of the RNA polymerase during replication and then facilitating the transfer onto the acceptor RNA [23], [24]. Although the foreign gene GFP seemed to be stably expressed, homologous RNA recombination was predicted to happen between the additional TRS6 and the authentic TRS6. RNA recombination was verified by PCR using primer pairs spanning ORF1b through ORF7 (Fig. 2A). The sizes of amplification products from HV and rHV cDNA were exactly the same as predicted (about 3.1 kb). Whereas two bands were observed in the products generated from rHV-GFP cDNA: a large band which was about 3.8 kb including the inserted GFP gene (about 0.7 kb), and a small band which was about 1.5 kb. The small band was gel-purified and sub-cloned. Sequencing analysis of forty clones showed that they were a mixture of RNA recombination products (Fig. 2B\u2013D). Thirty-one clones were identified as homologous recombinations between the additional TRS6 and the authentic TRS6 (which have the same primary sequences and local secondary RNA structures), resulting in an ORF2-ORF5 deletion as predicted (Fig. 2B). Novel RNA recombination was also found between the inserted GFP gene and ORF4, in which similar hairpin structures were found, and six clones were identified to have deletions including part of the GFP gene, ORF2-3, and part of ORF4 (Fig. 2C). Another three clones had recombinations between GFP and ORF5 (there are weak primary sequence similarity and higher order RNA structures existed in them), resulting in the deletion of partial GFP, ORF2-4, and partial ORF5 (Fig. 2D). We proposed that the replicase was attenuated at one of these secondary structures in the 3\u02b9-proximal part of the genome, following a base-pairing interaction, and then it could transfer onto the upstream region of the template which contained a hairpin structure for retargeting of RdRp and nascent strand. Thus, truncated viral genomes were continuously generated by RNA recombination during virus replication. Then, real-time PCR was performed to quantify the proportion of gene-deleted viruses. As shown in Fig. 2E, about 70.7% of rHV-GFP in the cell culture supernatant of transfected 293FT cells had full-length genome (29.3% viruses were gene-deleted). Complete viruses gradually decreased when rHV-GFP was serially passaged on PAMs, and the rate declined to about 52.8% at passage 36 (47.2% viruses were gene-deleted), which was significantly lower than that of passage 0 and passage 5, indicating that deletion mutants were gradually accumulated. However, as only a portion of the genome has been evaluated for recombination, small deletions could have been overlooked, and the proportion of gene-deleted virus is a minimum estimate.",

Immunofluorescence assay showed that some GFP negative cells were still viral N protein positive, suggesting that the deletion mutants retained the ability to replicate single cycle and express the remaining viral proteins (Fig. 4B). Then, we examined the kinetics of virus growth in PAMs. As shown in Fig. 4C, the growth curve of rHV was indistinguishable from that of wild-type HV, and virus titers were peaked at 36 h.p.i., whereas TRS6-insertion made rHV-GFP replicated slower than both HV and rHV. rHV-GFP titer at 36 h.p.i. was about six-fold and four-fold lower than that of HV and rHV, respectively, and its titer peak was delayed to 48 h.p.i.. Moreover, trypan blue exclusion dye staining showed that rHV-GFP induced less cell death (Fig. 4D).

The average rectal temperature remained higher than 40.5 \u00b0C from day 6 after HV infection and day 4 post rHV infection, respectively (Fig. 5B). In contrast, only one pig infected with rHV-GFP died at 21 d.p.i., while the other three pigs survived (Fig. 5A). However, the cause of death was not clear because it did not show typical syndromes of HP-PRRS. An indirect effect mediated by the high incidence of secondary infections in pigs exposed to HP-PRRSV might play a critical role in its death [25]. Two of four pigs infected with rHV-GFP transiently reached 40 \u00b0C and 40.2 \u00b0C at 4 d.p.i., respectively.

At 11 d.p.i., serum virus titers of rHV-GFP infected pigs were still 244-fold lower than that of rHV group. At the end of the experiment, virus was eliminated in one of the rHV-GFP infected pigs (Fig. 5C). Severe histopathogenic damages were observed in all HV and rHV infected pigs including severe proliferative interstitial pneumonia in the lung; severe degrees of vasculitis in the brain; blurred white medulla, hyperplastic red medulla in the spleen; collapse of follicles, depletion of germinal centers in the tonsil, and lymph nodes. Both HV and rHV-infected pigs had thymic lesions of cortical involution, causing a poor demarcation between the cortical and medullary zones. No obvious histopathologic damages other than mild interstitial pneumonia were observed in rHV-GFP infected pigs (Fig. 5D). Virus titers in multiple tissues were tested by real-time PCR (Fig. 5E). Results showed that virus titers of rHV-GFP infected pigs remained at significantly lower levels than that of HV and rHV infected pigs (range from 2-fold to 37-fold), except that tonsil was still a reservoir for rHV-GFP. Notably, virus titers in rHV-GFP infected lungs were about 35-fold lower than that of either HV or rHV infection. Virus isolation was also performed from virus infected lungs, and virus titers of rHV-GFP infected pigs were about 1000-fold lower than that of either HV or rHV infection. Taken together, these data demonstrated that rHV-GFP was remarkably attenuated.",

In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients, cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, and chemokines such as IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL10 were elevated [27]. The association between the elevated cytokines levels and the severe morbidity and high mortality could also be observed in United States swine experimentally infected by an HP-PRRSV strain [25]. In this study, TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2 were at least two-fold higher in HV and rHV infected lungs than that in rHV-GFP infected lungs. Anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and SOCS1 were also higher during HV and rHV infection (Fig. 6A). In lymphoid organs, rHV-GFP infection induced significantly lower levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL10 in tracheobronchial lymph node (range from 3-fold to 176-fold), and more than 33-fold lower of IL-8 in spleen than those in HV-infected pigs (Fig. 6B and C). The decreased cytokine and chemokine expressions during rHV-GFP infection might contribute to the fact that pigs survived with no or only mild pathological lesions.",

This finding was in accordance with the assumption that RNA recombination might be driven by similar factors and/or signals as discontinuous transcription in nidoviruses [1]. In subgenomic mRNAs synthesis process which resembles similarity-assisted RNA recombination, several noncanonical TRSs have been identified as leader-body junction sites [28], [29]. Moreover, insertion of foreign sequence promoted the utilization of TRS-like sequence within the inserted gene and cryptic TRS-like sequences that remained non-functional in native virus [30], [31]. In a previous study [32], a replication-competent equine arteritis virus (EAV) expressing GFP via an extra subgenomic mRNA was constructed and leader-to-body junction sites were also found within the GFP gene. Gradual accumulation of viral mutants carrying deletions in the GFP gene was also observed.

As wild-type P129 strain only cause mild clinical signs in infected pigs [10], [33], we assume that it might be hard to observe the different clinical syndromes between the wild-type P129 and the manipulated strains.

Naturally occurring DI RNAs have been identified for both arteriviruses and coronaviruses [34], [35]. For PRRS virus, the DI-like RNAs are also proposed as \u201cheteroclite RNA\u201d [36], [37], [38]. It has been assumed that the DI virus acts as a competitive inhibitor of the complete functional virus (often referred to as the \u2018helper\u2019 virus) as DI virus can strongly reduce the yield of helper virus in a mixed infection. In some cases, DI virus has also been observed to attenuate disease in virus-infected animals [39]. In our study, the introduction of an additional TRS6 and foreign gene GFP facilitated the copy-choice template switching and resulted in high-frequency of similarity-assisted RNA recombination. The deletion mutants have retained the essential cis-acting signals for RNA synthesis and viral encapsidation that located in the termini of the genome. When co-infected with wild-type virus with full-length genome, the subsistence of the large number of gene-deleted mutants is largely dependent on complementation of virions with full-length genome, and thus would sequester limiting factor such as viral polymerase components or essential host proteins, and then reduce the viral load of the virulent wild-type virus by interfering the RNA synthesis and virus packaging [38], [39]. This might be the possible mechanism accounting for the attenuation of rHV-GFP.",

Then PCR was performed to identify gene-deleted genomes. (B) rHV-GFP replication was analyzed by detecting the expression of GFP and viral N protein using immunofluorescence assay at 24 h.p.i. (C) The growth curves of parental viruses and the recombinant rHV-GFP were drew by assaying the viral titers of the cell culture supernatants harvested at the indicated time points (12, 24, 36, and 48 h) post-infection by a standard TCID50 assay. *p < 0.05 between rHV-GFP and the other two viruses, respectively. (D) Representative images of cell death induced by parental viruses and rHV-GFP at 36 h.p.i. PAMs were stained by trypan blue. Magnification, 200\u00d7. (E) Cell death rates at 36 h.p.i. were determined by trypan blue exclusion dye staining. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01.",
