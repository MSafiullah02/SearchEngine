Such products are then applied in agriculture, medicine, and industrial biotechnology [ 3 -6 ] .

Among the wide range of methods and expression hosts available for the production of biotech products, ICs are ideal for the production of complex proteins requiring extensive posttranslational modifi cation. The development of the fi eld was driven by the importance of insects in all fi elds of human endeavor. Insects are the most diverse of all groups of organisms, with more species than any other. The number of extant species is estimated at about 1.9 \u00d7 10 6 and potentially represents over 90 % of the various animal life forms on Earth [ 7 ] . They have overwhelming impact on agriculture and public health. Insect biotechnology uses biotechnological methods on insects (or their cells) to develop products or services. These new substances have applications in medicine, the sustainable protection of plants, and industrial biotechnology. This means that insect biotechnology employs the general principles of biotechnology. More specifi cally, insect biotechnology borrows from and is driven by scientifi c breakthroughs in molecular biology, particularly by the development of tools and techniques that allow genetic characterization and engineering of organisms and cells as with recombinant DNA technology and plant protoplast fusion. Recently, bacteria have been engineered to carry and express silk genes from the mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori , and used in the production of synthetic silk, the natural protein fi ber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles [ 8 ] (see also Chap. 10 ). As a basic research tool, the strategies of insect biotechnology include the sequencing and annotation of insect genomes as well as analyses using comparative genomics. Insect biotechnological applications to pest management include the development of resistant crops and trees that express insect-specifi c toxins, the design of microbial agents with enhanced insecticidal potency, and the engineering of insects that can transfer lethal genes to natural populations following their mass release in the fi eld. Comparative genomics analyses also make it possible to identify insectspecifi c genes that can be targeted for rational insecticide design.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 96, "end": 104, "text": "[ 1 -3 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 409, "end": 417, "text": "[ 3 -6 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1326, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2265, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction and Scope"}, {"text": "It has been shown by the USDA [ 9 ] and numerous other sources that insects and nematodes are the world's most important pests of agricultural plants and livestock.

As already indicated earlier in this review, chemical pesticides are a major tool for insect and nematode control.

A major strategy in increasing crop yield is the development of pest management regimens consisting of herbicide-resistant (HR) and insectresistant (IR) crops as well as transgenic insects. Genetically modifi ed (GM) crops fi rst became commercially available in 1996. By 2008, 90 % of soybean, 78 % of cotton, 72 % of canola, and 60 % of maize hectares were cultivated globally with these GM crops [ 10 ] . The most well-known example of this genetic manipulation in both plants and viruses is the insertion into a plant or virus of the gene coding for the production of the delta endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis [ 11 ] . B. thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, commonly used as a biological pesticide. It also occurs naturally in the environment of mosquito larvae, moth, and butterfl y caterpillars, as well as on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, fl our mills, and granaries [ 12 ] . Many Bt strains produce \"Cry\" during sporulation. Cry (short for crystal proteins; Fig. 8 .1 ), also called \u03b4-endotoxins, are proteinaceous inclusions encoded by plasmid-borne cry genes and have insecticidal action on susceptible insects. Bt is remarkably nontoxic to humans, and to a large extent nontarget fauna, and is easy to use, making it a popular alternative to chemical treatments for crop protection.

The active Bt toxin binds to a receptor in cells lining the insect midgut and creates a channel, allowing free passage of ions. The cells lining the midgut die, and very soon, the insect dies, too. Different strains of Bt contain plasmids encoding different toxins with different specifi cities of action against insects. A particular toxin is generally effective against only a limited range of closely related species. Bt toxins are used in a variety of transgenic crops, including cotton, for protection against a variety of lepidopteran pests; corn (maize), for protection against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera); and potatoes, for protection against the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata .

The use of actively growing cells (i.e., cells in exponential growth phase) to start the culture. Cells such as the Sf9 and Sf21 may be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. A temperature of 27-28 \u00b0C is optimal for growing these cells. Starter media such as TC-100 medium (Sigma, Cat# T3160) supplemented with heat inactivated 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) double in 20-24 h and do not require CO 2 . Mammalian sera contain complement which mediates quick inactivation of baculoviruses (BVs). It is important to start cells from a frozen cell stock to avoid contamination. High-quality insect cells are crucial for the success of BV expression. Clumping could be a problem and should be avoided. Avoiding media particles could help reduce clumping, and gentle shaking in shake fl asks could help dislodge them. 2. The importance of medium quality cannot be overemphasized. Synthetic serumfree media are available from Invitrogen and other suppliers and are hassle-free. Certain media can be preferred for certain applications. For example, synthetic serum-free media are strongly recommended for the expression of secreted proteins but can be also used for non-secreted protein studies and for transfections. 3. Transition from serum-containing to synthetic serum-free medium (weaning) is done gradually on healthy cells growing in log phase. It is done by slowly decreasing the percentage of serum-containing medium and increasing the percentage of synthetic serum-free medium in the cell culture over a period of about a week. 4. Antibiotics may be used to control contamination. An example is penicillin/ streptomycin solution (Invitrogen SKU# 15070-063) used at 1:99 dilution. Gentamycin and nystatin can also be used routinely in insect cell culture. The use of antibiotics is optional. 5. Insect cells such as Sf9 or Sf21 cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen for many years frozen in TC-100 or similar medium supplemented with heat inactivated 10 % FBS. When needed, frozen cells may be thawed in a carefully designed protocol to avoid damage. 6. Cleanliness of glassware is an important requirement.

A well-known and accepted economic process for this purpose is the production of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors in lepidopteran Sf9 cells using recombinant AcMNPV or other BVs [ 92 -96 ] . BV-mediated gene transfer has already demonstrated therapeutic effi cacy in ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy studies [ 97 -100 ] . Gene therapy has so fully come of age so much that the high potential of this therapeutic modality can now be realized for treating several diseases, such as severe immune defi ciencies [ 101 , 102 ] , ocular diseases [ 103 ] , and cancer [ 104 ] . Several virus-derived vectors and non-virus gene transfer agents have been used to address these applications.

Since the development of the IC-BEVS in the 1980s [ 117 ] , thousands of recombinant proteins, ranging from cytosolic enzymes to membrane-bound proteins, have been successfully produced in BV-infected ICs. However, expression yields in optimized transformed fed-batch mammalian cells cultured in a bioreactor commonly reach grams of recombinant protein per L; in ICs infected by recombinant BVs, the yield rarely exceeds 50-100 mg per L. This relatively low expression capacity can be compensated in the IC-BEVS by the short development times and lower costs associated with a specifi c product. This implies that for the production of a recombinant protein with market needs not exceeding 5-10 kg per year (i.e., subunit vaccines), the IC-BEVS is currently one of the best alternatives [ 118 ] . In fact, most licensed products obtained in ICs correspond to vaccines and not to products with a high production demand such as therapeutic antibodies [ 119 ] . However, the yield is not the only bottleneck of the IC-BEVS. A marked proteolysis of recombinant proteins during BV-based production is frequently encountered.
