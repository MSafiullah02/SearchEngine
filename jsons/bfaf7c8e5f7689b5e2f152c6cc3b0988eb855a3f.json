Guidance for Integrated Urban Hydrometeorological, Climate and Environmental Services (Volume I) has been developed with the intent to provide an overview of the concept, methods and good practices for producing and providing these services to respond to the hazards across a range of time scales (weather to climate). This involves combining (dense) heterogeneous observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, multi-hazard early warning systems and climate services to assist cities in setting and implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies for the management and building of resilient and sustainable cities. IUS include research, evaluation and delivery with a wide participation from city governments, national hydrometeorological services, international organizations, universities, research institutions and private sector stakeholders. An overview of the IUS concept with key messages, examples of good practice and recommendations are provided. The research community will play an important role to: identify critical research challenges; provide impact forecasts and warnings; develop and deliver IUS internationally, and; support national and local communities in the implementation of IUS thereby contributing to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals at all scales. 2015-2030 (UNDRR, 2015) aims to substantially reduce impacts of disaster in terms of mortality, economic loss and damages, and disruption of basic services, while contributing to the mitigation of technological and security risks, through the provision of impact-based services (WMO, 2016). These services consider hazards, vulnerability and exposure. Governments, businesses and the public need to understand how the hydrometeorological hazard may affect their lives, livelihoods, property and economic activity in order to take appropriate actions. As weather, air quality, climate and the water cycle know no national boundaries, international cooperation at a global scale is essential to develop commensurate services and to reap the benefits from their application. The WMO, a United Nations Specialized Agency, provides the framework for such international cooperation. This intergovernmental organization's 193 member states and territories (called Members) are mainly concerned with issues at a national, regional and international J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Highlights J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 25 CONFLICT OF INTEREST None J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 26 Author statement J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof",

As the components of urban systems are tightly intertwined, having good predictions that are tailored for the different systems, spatially explicit at the appropriate scale and refreshed at appropriate frequencies allows for the systems to be operated efficiently and effectively. This is especially important when extreme events occur. For example, tropical cyclones (typhoons or hurricanes) impact cities around the world annually, causing a cascade of effects ( Figure 1 ) including hazardous meteorological conditions (blue); first order impacts (green); and follow-on impacts (purple). The latter impacts may be immediate, as with traffic accidents associated with severe convection (e.g. road flooding) or take longer (days -weeks) to manifest themselves (e.g. plant disease). These impacts (Figure 1 ) are not exhaustive, as there are also socioeconomic impacts to individuals, neighbourhoods, the city, region and often beyond.",

To understand the state and development plans of IUS for good practice (WMO, 2019a), exploratory surveys were conducted with 31 urban experts representing 22 specific cities (Table 1) . Some IUS were in demonstration or pre-operational mode but contributed key messages. Other key messages include the needs for: long term planning/design; bridging scientific disciplines (weather, climate, air quality, hydrology; cross-service integration); cross-jurisdictional (national, regional, urban) organizations and urban authorities (cross-sector) and; open data infrastructure and communication. In the following highlights from the survey are discussed briefly.",

Initially, the focus was on air pollution episodes and high-impact weather during the Shanghai World Expo 2010. Subsequently, this has expanded to consider multiple weather hazards and to incorporate the vulnerability and exposure of various sites to enhance the resilience of the city infrastructure and capacity for risk management. (Tang, 2006) . A 50-member Shanghai Emergency Management Response Committee (EMC, Figure 3 ) was established and in February 2013, the Shanghai Emergency Warning Center was formed to enhance and improve the existing emergency procedures (Figure 3 ). Thirty-six joint response mechanisms including co-operation agreements, warnings and action plans among 25 government agencies for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation were created. Action plans for weather disasters are issued by the General Office of SMS and each agency has defined responsibilities. ",

Following the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) event, local planning and development measures were implemented (Ng, 2009; Ren et al., 2011 ) that included weather considerations, and are now used elsewhere . Long-Term Urban Planning: Climate change should be considered in all urban planning because of the long times scales involved. Urban planners would like urban system models outputs at high spatial resolution. This can be achieved using high resolution weather models (~1 km) forced by multiple simulations of climate scenarios (e.g. carbon dioxide doubling) to provide climate and air quality at urban spatial and temporal scales (Amorim et al., 2018; Takane et al., 2019) . These models can account for the urban fabric (Ching et al., 2018) , physical (e.g., anthropogenic car emissions) and human behaviour processes (e.g. excess heat from use of air conditioners in heat waves; Lemonsu et al., 2012; Masson et al., 2013 Schoetter et al., 2017 Takane et al., 2019) . As urban designers need both access to and understanding of the data/products, cross-sector (e.g., Earth system scientists to/from urban planners), training is necessary. For example, urban weather, climate, analysis and application can be linked from hazard to urban design considerations ( Figure 5 ).",
