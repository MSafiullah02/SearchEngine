In particular, using computed tomography (CT) not only the extension and the severity of the disease can be precisely characterized, but according to the recent study of Bai et al.

Nevertheless, in the following days, over an interval of 6 days from intubation, four patients previously stable or with a former improvement (overall 33.3%) had a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions; four patients (22.3%) remained stable and eight progressively improved (44.4%). At the chest X-ray performed at admission, nine showed an interstitial pattern and eight pulmonary consolidations. Only one had a negative chest X-ray which then evolved within 24 h in consolidations. Within 6 days, 89% of the patients (n = 16) showed a wide patch of parenchymal consolidations at imaging, a finding which is consistent with the literature [3, 4]. One patient died 18 days after hospital admission.",
