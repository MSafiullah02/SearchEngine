The lineages of the cells that will develop into the immune system are present at the beginning of the second trimester. The major components of the neonatal immune system, including T cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and the complement pathways, are functionally impaired, however, when compared with those in older infants and adults. For example, neonatal neutrophils show decreased chemotaxis, diminished adherence to the endothelium, and impaired phagocytosis3,\n4; neonatal complement levels and opsonic capacity also are reduced, particularly in the premature neonate.4,\n5 In addition, neonatal T cell lymphokine production, cytotoxicity, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and help for B cell differentiation all are inferior when measured against those in adults.6 Antigenic naivet\u00e9 may account for many of these differences; however, inherent immaturity also appears to account for certain inequities. For example, neonatal T cells are delayed in their ability to generate antigen-specific memory function after HSV infection, even in comparison with naive adult T cells.7\n",

Use of a cutoff period of 48 hours or less to designate maternally acquired infections allowed 15.3% of bacteremias and 14.5% of pneumonias to be considered as originating from a maternal source.

The most common pathogen associated with nosocomial bloodstream infections is CoNS (see Table 35\u20132). Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Candida species, E. coli, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa also play important roles and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates than those associated with CoNS.49,\n50 In one study, the frequency of fulminant sepsis (fatal within 48 hours) was estimated to be 56% (95% CI 38% to 72%) when the bloodstream infection was caused by Pseudomonas species, whereas it was only 1% (95% CI 0% to 4%) when infection was caused by CoNS.50 The difficulty of assigning an etiologic role to CoNS on the basis of one blood culture that could be contaminated probably accounts for some distortion of the incidence and mortality data related to this organism, and this problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.",

After multiple attempts, the outbreak finally was interrupted after a 15-day interval during which bacitracin ointment was applied to the umbilical stump in all infants, and affected infants received intramuscular penicillin. Molecular techniques have enhanced the ability to define outbreaks, and use of these techniques has suggested that transmission can occur between mother and infant, between HCW and infant, and between infants\u2014 probably indirectly on the hands of HCWs.82,\n83 In one recurring outbreak, inadequate laundry practices appeared to be a contributing factor.85\n",

Subsequently, an increase in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis was noted by local pediatric surgeons. Results of a CDC investigation suggested a causal role of erythromycin in the cases of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.133,\n134 Erythromycin remains the recommended agent of choice for prophylaxis after pertussis exposure, but parents should be informed of the risk and signs of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, and cases associated with erythromycin use should be reported to MedWatch.135\n",

In one study of 34 patients with fungemia due to Candida species, a case-fatality rate of 41% was reported.143 Risk factors for fungal infections in neonates are similar to risk factors for bacterial infections; low birth weight and gestational age are important predictors. In addition, a prospective, multicenter study of 2157 infants found that use of a third-generation cephalosporin, presence of a CVC, intravenously administered lipids, and H2 blocker therapy were associated with Candida colonization after adjusting for length of stay, birth weight of 1000g or less, and gestational age less than 32 weeks.14\nCandida parapsilosis appears to be the most frequent species associated with nosocomial Candida infection in NICU infants.

In another report, the source of HSV for the index case, an infant who died of respiratory distress in whom evidence of HSV infection was found at postmortem examination of the brain, was unknown.176 The hands of HCWs were implicated in the spread of HSV to three subsequent cases, however. In another report, direct spread from an HCW was thought to be responsible for transmission of HSV to three infants over a period of approximately 3 years.177 Studies of adults with herpes labialis suggest a high frequency of recovery of virus from the mouth and the hands (78% and 67%, respectively).178 In this same study, HSV was shown to survive for 2 to 4 hours on skin, cloth, and plastic. Implementing contact precautions for infants with HSV and instructing HCWs with active herpes labialis regarding control measures, such as covering the lesion, not touching the lesion, and using strict hand hygiene, are reasonable means to prevent nosocomial transmission of HSV. If there are concerns that an HCW would be unable to comply with control measures or if the HCW has a herpetic whitlow, such persons should be restricted from patient contact.",

Premature infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation are unlikely to have received protective levels of VZV IgG from their mothers, so their potential risk is significant if an exposure occurs.

Establishing an NICU\u2019s endemic infection rate and expected variation around that rate allows the ICP to rapidly identify unusual increases in rates that may indicate on outbreak (epidemic) of a particular infection. Using baseline surveillance data along with aggregate data from sources such as the NNIS system allows the ICP to develop meaningful threshold rates for initiating outbreak investigation.188 Alternatively, HCWs can be the first to sense an increase in infections, which then can be confirmed or refuted by surveillance data.200 Even a single case of infection due to an unusual and potentially dangerous pathogen (e.g., Salmonella) can constitute the index case for a subsequent outbreak and thus merits rapid and comprehensive investigation. Outbreaks may need to be reported to health authorities, depending on local and state requirements as well as the organism involved.",

Investigation of the dryers revealed extensive contamination with the outbreak organism. This case illustrates the importance of having standard hospital laundry protocols and ensuring that appropriate water and dryer temperatures are maintained. When such protocols are followed, the mechanical actions of washing and rinsing, combined with hot water and/or the addition of chemicals such as chlorine bleach, and a final commercial dryer and/or ironing step significantly reduce bacterial counts.235,\n236 Few hospitals in the United States use cloth diapers, but regardless of type used, soiled diapers should be carefully bagged in plastic and removed from the unit every 8 hours.216\n",

Freezing breast milk has been shown to decrease viral titers but does not eliminate CMV; pasteurization of human milk can inactivate CMV.

It also is possible for invasive devices and intravascular catheters to be dislodged by close contact with an active sibling.

This is especially important for preterm infants, as well as full-term infants with barrier compromise such as abrasions or dermatitis. If a soap is necessary for heavily soiled areas, a mild pH-neutral product without additives should be used, and duration of soaping should be restricted to less than 5 minutes no more than three times per week.257\n",

As an alternative to endotracheal intubation, noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation avoids some of the common risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia and has been used successfully for neonates.268,\n269 Respiratory care equipment that comes in contact with mucous membranes of ventilated patients or that is part of the ventilator circuit should be single use (discarded after one-time use with a single patient) or be subjected to sterilization or high-level disinfection between patients. Wet heat pasteurization (processing at 76\u00b0C for 30 minutes) or chemical disinfectants can be used to achieve high-level disinfection of reusable respiratory equipment.263 Ventilator circuits should be changed no more frequently than every 48 hours, and evidence suggests that extending the length of time between changes to 7 days does not increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.270,\n271 Circuits should be monitored for accumulation of condensate and drained periodically, with care taken to avoid allowing the condensate, a potential reservoir for pathogens, to drain toward the patient.263,\n267 Sterile fluids should be used for nebulization, and sterile water should be used to rinse reusable semicritical equipment and devices such as in-line medication nebulizers.263\n",

Also, placement of enteral feeding tubes should be verified before their use.263,\n267 To prevent regurgitation and potential aspiration of stomach contents by the sedated patient, overdistention of the stomach should be avoided by regular monitoring of the patient\u2019s intestinal motility, serial measurement of residual gastric volume or abdominal girth, reducing the use of narcotics and anticholinergic agents, and adjusting the rate and volume of enteral feedings.263,\n267 Oral decontamination, with the intent of decreasing oropharyngeal colonization, has been studied in adults and seems to lower the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (although not duration of ventilation or mortality rate),275,\n276 but further work is needed to determine whether this is an effective strategy in neonates. In addition, medications such as sucralfate, as opposed to histamine H2 receptor antagonists and antacids, which raise gastric pH and can potentially result in increased bacterial colonization of the stomach, have been used to prevent development of stress ulcers and have been associated with lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults.277 Two studies suggest, however, that this approach is of no benefit in pediatric patients, but the authors stress that additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.278,\n279\n",
