The large poxviruses also have an envelope but peplomers have so far not been identified. The projections are composed of one or two kinds of polypeptides which are glycosylated. The composition of the carbohydrate part varies from virus to virus and also depends on the host cell in which virus replication has occurred.",

Cell receptors contain sialic acid and the virus enzyme can release the acid by cleaving the receptor. Also paramyxoviruses carry two different kinds of surface projection but now the VAP function and neuraminidase activity reside in the same polypeptide. In most viruses the surface projections are composed of more than one polypeptide as, for example, among togaviruses (Sindbis virus and Semliki forest virus), which have a haemagglutinin formed by three polypeptides.",

            "text": "Virus infection in cell cultures and in animals is to a large extent dependent upon the capacity of a virus to adsorb to the target cells, i.e. upon the presence of receptors. In a susceptible animal species the expression of receptors varies in different cell types and even in the same cell type in different stages of differentiation. Receptors for poliovirus only occur in primates. Other picornaviruses, e.g. encephalomyocarditis viruses, appear to be capable of binding to cells from many different species. Species-specific and organ-specific occurrence of receptors has been demonstrated for certain picornaviruses. The coxsackie B virus may cause infection in the nasopharynx and in skeletal and heart muscles in man, independent of age. In mice, the same virus can only infect newborn but not adult animals. Cellular receptors have been demonstrated in newborn but not in adult mice. Coxsackie A virus receptors, on the other hand, are absent in mouse embryo tissue except for differentiated myoblasts, in which they can be identified before the formation of myotubuli. These observations correlate well with the finding that in mice coxsackie A virus infections attack muscular tissue. With the majority of enveloped viruses, e.g. myxoviruses and rhabdoviruses, receptors can be found in many different animal species. The presence or absence of receptors might explain the capacity of the virus to infect different species (host range), and its affinity for different organs in the host organism (tropism) (see\nChapter 13).",

Receptor material is continuously secreted into the medium of the cell cultures. If intact cells are treated with proteolytic, or in some cases glucosidases, they may lose their virus receptors. After washing and prolonged incubation in a growth medium the receptors are regenerated in a characteristic fashion. This occurs within 2\u201312 hours. The regeneration of the N-acetyl neuraminic acid-containing receptor for influenza and polyomavirus cannot occur merely by synthesis of the carbohydrate part of the molecule; the protein part must also be synthesized.",

As a general principle it can be stated that an isolated nucleic acid is infectious only when extracted from viruses which for their replication do not require a virion-associated RNA polymerase (cf. Chapter 3). The mechanism for cellular uptake of isolated nucleic acid is different from the mechanism responsible for penetration of virus particles. Isolated RNA from picornaviruses, for example, therefore can infect cells from a species which lacks receptors for the virus. These cells allow the synthesis of complete virus particles but further spread of infection cannot occur owing to the absence of receptors on surrounding non-infected cells. Infectious nucleic acids are demonstrable with RNA from togavirus and DNA from, for example, polyomavirus and SV40 virus. Free nucleic acid has an infectious capacity which is 103\u2013106 times lower than that of intact virus as calculated per amount of nucleic acid, largely because of the inefficient uptake of nucleic acid.",

In adenoviruses it has been shown that the presence of a covalently bound protein at the 5\u2032 terminal of the two DNA strands remarkably increases infectivity. With viruses which have virion-associated polymerases, there are two different situations. In one case, the polymerase is activated by changes induced in the virus envelope during uptake with vaccinia, retrovirus and certain paramyxoviruses, for example. In the other case, proteolytic digestion is required for activation of the polymerase, for example, in reoviruses and related viruses. The different problems concerning virus penetration may best be illustrated by providing details of some selected viruses.",

            "text": "Chemical treatment of poliovirus can yield a number of different kinds of subviral particles. By comparing the characteristics of these particles with corresponding structures which can be recovered during the process of virus penetration into cells, certain conclusions can be drawn concerning the mechanism of uptake. The poliovirus capsid is made from four different polypeptides: VP1, VP2, VP3, with a molecular weight of about 25 000\u201335 000; and VP4, with a molecular weight of about 6000. VP4 is probably located internally in the virion since it cannot be labelled by radioactive isotopes from the outside of the intact virions. After binding of virus to cells at low temperature and a subsequent increase of the temperature of incubation to 37\u00b0C, a release of about 50 per cent of virus occurs from the cells. Particles which are released are structurally changed and lack VP4. Furthermore, they do not retain a capacity to readsorb to the cells and probably they have been released together with some membrane components. Antigen analyses of the eluted particles indicate that they have been changed so that they have the same surface properties as heat-treated virus particles. This indicates that an irreversible adsorption to the cytoplasmic membrane leads to a structural change of the virion which causes an opening of the virus capsid thus allowing RNA to penetrate the cell membrane. Recently it was shown that inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as pactamycin, can block the intake of poliovirus, most likely by preventing the release of RNA.",

After an irreversible adsorption of virions to receptors, nucleocapsid structures penetrate the plasma membrane and eventually DNA is released into the nucleus of the cell. Regarding most viruses it is still unclear whether they are taken up in vesicles or via direct penetration of the plasma membrane without vesicle formation. After penetration, intracellular particles which lack fibres and vertex capsomers can be identified chemically. Digestion by nucleases of these subviral particles causes the destruction of about 70 per cent of DNA. In the cytoplasm of cells a nucleoprotein complex of adenovirus which lacks the outer capsid can be demonstrated. Eventually, virus-DNA is delivered to the nucleus of the cell where virus-specific mRNA synthesis takes place. It appears as if virus-specific basic proteins associated with DNA are released and then substituted for cellular histones before the RNA synthesis can be initiated. Most likely the dissociation between nucleoprotein and capsid occurs at the nuclear membrane in proximity to nuclear pores.",

            "text": "The penetration of Semliki forest virus (SFV) has been studied in great detail (Figure 7.2)\n. The viral glycoprotein projections form a multivalent complex with the receptors which are transported in the membrane to ultrastructurally defined regions referred to as \u2018coated pits\u2019, whereafter formation of vesicles may take place. This can be observed by electron microscopy. Virus particles can be identified in vesicles and at some later stage the vesicles coalesce with lysosomes by membrane fusion. The infection may be prohibited by treatment of cells with substances (chloroquine and ammonium salts) which accumulate in the lysosome and increase the pH. On the other hand, it has been found that a direct fusion between SFV and the plasma membrane can be obtained if the pH is less than 6 in the medium. Such a milieu is established when vesicles containing virus particles are fused with lysosomes and the subsequent fusion between the virus envelope and surrounding membrane structures leads to a release of nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm. It is possible that other lipid-containing viruses use a similar mechanism to introduce their nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of cells. In the case of orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, for example, mRNA can be formed only by a virion-associated polymerase. The mechanism of intake therefore must allow a penetration of the nucleoprotein structure. Recent findings indicate that in the case of orthomyxoviruses the mechanism of penetration is similar to that of SFV discussed above. A fusion between vesicles formed by viropexis and lysosomes leads to a reduction of pH which in turn causes fusion between the virus envelope and the surrounding membrane. However, in the case of paramyxoviruses it has long been known that the virus has the capacity to fuse directly with the cytoplasmic membrane and that one of the virus peplomers, the fusion factor, is responsible for this fusion.",
