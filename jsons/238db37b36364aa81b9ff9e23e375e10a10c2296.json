This is paradoxical since it is pathologists and anatomical pathology technologists (APTs) in the mortuary who are more likely to be involved closely than many other medical and paramedical staff. The purpose of this chapter is to outline some of the history of bioterrorism (BT), the responses of government, what the likely agents are and their clinical pathologies, medico-legal aspects and what everyone in mortuary work should be prepared for. By definition, much is uncertainty, although the expert consensus is that all industrialised countries could experience a BT attack sooner or later. Following the initiative of the USA, many countries (including the UK) have drawn up plans and produced guidance documents. These have been freely adopted here, accompanied by personal observations where there is no agreed evidence base.",

The civil and criminal investigation responses to that event are well documented (3) , but the critical role of pathology in that investigation needs to be emphasised (4) (5) (6) .",

More recently, the significant BT events have been: l USA 1984: contamination of salad bars with Salmonella typhimurium, apparently for local political purposes (3, 10) ; 751 persons affected; no deaths. l Iraq 1990s: following the first Gulf war in 1991, it became evident that the country had prepared and stockpiled vast quantities of botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and anthrax spores (8, 21, 31) . These were never found-presumed to have been destroyed on site-by the subsequent USA and Europe science teams that went in search of weapons of mass destruction. l Japan 1995: when the attack on the Tokyo metro with the neurotoxic sarin gas by the Aum Shinrikyo cult was investigated, it emerged that members had visited Zaire in order to obtain samples of Ebola virus for BT purposes (10) . They were not successful. They had also attempted to disseminate Clostridium botulinum toxin, unsuccessfully (31) . l USA 1996: contamination of food in a laboratory staff rest room with Shigella dysenteriae; motive unknown (3) . Twelve persons became ill; no deaths. l USA 2001: about 10 gm of anthrax spores was sent in multiple envelopes by post, by person(s) unknown, which resulted in 22 cases. The presumed intended targets were news media and government personnel (36) . The index case had anthrax meningitis (4) . Twenty of the victims handled mail, and one person was probably accidentally infected by indirect letter-to-letter contamination. Eleven cases were cutaneous anthrax (all survived); 11 cases were inhalational or meningeal anthrax of whom five died (3, 5, 23) ; 32,000 people received antibiotic prophylaxis. event and the population involved and can vary from a minimal effect to disruption of ongoing activities and emotional reaction, illness, or death'' (7) . Bioterrorism should be distinguished from state-initiated biowarfare research projects and applications. The governments of the UK, USA, Germany, USSR, Japan and Iraq, to list only the most publicised examples, have all supported research into the potential use of biological agents in order to harm enemy military and/or civilian personnel in the twentieth century. They have officially ceased such activities now, but much important information has been gleaned from accidents and other events during this phase of activity.",

Further, in the UK, the general lack of training in, and experience of, infectious diseases for pathologists (as opposed to cancer, the bedrock of histopathology training) is a concern. The situation already exists whereby pathologists may refuse to undertake Hazard Group 3 infectious autopsy cases (e.g. HIV, TB, HCV) for fear of infection of themselves and their APTs. There is ethical debate as to the degree to which medical practitioners are expected to potentially put their lives at risk in managing patients.
