Data on influenza-like illness (ILI: \u054637.8\u00b0C plus at least one respiratory symptom) occurrence were collected weekly. In those children with an ILI, parents were asked to collect nasal swabs and send via surface mail for viral polymerase chain reaction. Vaccine efficacy (VE) for ILI was estimated overall and for subgroups aged 6-23 and 24-59 months using the formula VE = 1relative risk (RR). Results: Sixty-three per cent (151/238) of eligible children had parents give consent. Sixty-three children received influenza vaccine and 88 participated as controls. Of 26 specimens returned, a virus was detected in 18 (69%); none with influenza. Two symptomatic children had positive near-patient influenza tests in general practice (one a vaccine failure). The RR with 95% confidence interval in all children and those aged 6-23 months were less than one, 0.56 (0.32-1.02) and 0.46 (0.15-1.45), respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and utility of parent-collected and mailed respiratory specimens for VE research in the childcare setting. Two-thirds of parent-collected swabs proved positive for at least one virus.

A population-based surveillance study showed that less than 10% of hospitalised children aged \u054559 months with ILI had confirmed influenza infection. 34 Our study has some limitations. The childcare centres were not randomised. The commencement midway through an influenza season limited the number of influenza cases identified. Less than half the episodes in children of ILI (26 out of 59, 44%) had a respiratory sample sent. This reduced sampling is probably due to the added burden on parents of sample collection (and posting) while a child is ill. In addition, as the childcare centres were in the suburbs with relatively lower Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas 35 (and also involved larger families), this, too, may have limited parental cooperation. The participants were only followed from the 2nd half of August when the 2007 season was peaking, so some may have thought that sample collection in September or October was too late. Given the limited data that were collected on symptomatology and the relatively small number of specimens, it was not possible to do an extensive analysis comparing symptoms by virus type to address if there are differences in symptoms among various viruses. Furthermore, the demographic data (e.g. sex, age range) of those who did not participate in the study were not collected; therefore, it was not possible to identify if there was any recruitment bias. Greater efforts are required for future studies in (i) improving the proportion of swabs collected and sent by initiating ILI follow up before the influenza season starts and findings better ways to overcome parents' reluctance in submitting swabs; (ii) obtaining more detailed data on symptomatology of respiratory infection; and (iii) collecting de-identified demographic data on those who are not enrolled in the study. This study showed no evidence for influenza VE. There was only a suggestion of protection in that all the point estimates were in that direction. Trivalent, live, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (CAIV-T) may be a better option for young children and has been demonstrated to have significantly higher efficacy than inactivated vaccine among young children during moderate 36, 37 and high attack-rate influenza seasons. 38 CAIV-T was also able to provide protection even when the circulating influenza virus was an antigenically distinct strain. 37 There were two children with positive results for influenza A from the near-patient test.
