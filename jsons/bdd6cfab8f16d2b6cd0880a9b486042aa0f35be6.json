Herein, 30-nm aluminum nanoparticles (ANs), unlike the mostly used adjuvant alum which is unsuitable for delivering pulmonary vaccines due to side effects, proved able to act as a VADS fitting inhalation immunization to elicit wide-spread anti-antigen immunity. In vitro ANs facilitated cellular uptake of their cargos and, after pulmonary vaccination, induced mouse production of high levels of anti-antigen IgG in serum and IgA in saliva, nasal, bronchoalveolar and also vaginal fluids. Besides, IFN-\u03b3 and anti-antigen IgG2a enriched in immunized mice which meanwhile showed no obvious lung inflammation indicated balanced Th1/Th2 responses were safely induced. These outcomes suggest ANs may be an efficient pulmonary VADS for defending against pathogens, especially, the ones invading hosts via respiratory system.",

However, injection vaccination often shows difficulty in sponsoring the antigen-specific immune responses at mucosa, which is the gate whereby most infectious agents invade hosts [5] . Thus, injection of vaccines can hardly elicit mucosal immunity to form the first line of barrier to pathogen attack. Also, injection involves inconvenience of management, poor compliance, and difficult administration without trained medical professionals [6] . By contrast, mucosal vaccination can be conveniently carried out and demonstrates the ability of triggering systemic as well as mucosal immunity toward pathogens. Moreover, mucosal administration is considered the beneficial vaccination route, because mucosal immune system is evolved with numerous mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) [7] . MALTs contribute to constituting the mucosal immune network throughout the body and function to facilitate setting up comprehensive immunity against invading agents [8] . Mucosal vaccination can be undertaken at mucosa of several physiological and anatomical sites, such as gastrointestinal lumen, nasal cavity, pulmonary alveolus, vagina and oral cavity [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

            "text": "Respiratory system mucosa represents the most vulnerable and popular site whereby lethal pathogens attack and knock out hosts, because it shows a mild environment and exchanges air and borne materials most frequently with the outside [16] . Recently, several ravaging epidemics or pandemics with a high fatality are all associated with respiratory system infections, e.g., 2003 SARS, 2009 H1N1 swine flu, 2012 MERS, and the now ongoing COVID19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2) [17] [18] [19] . In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is now still rapidly spreading across the whole world from initial epicenter of Wuhan in China, and has caused a severe pandemic claimed nearly 15 000 people's lives among more than 300 000 infections [20] . To prevent the epidemic situation worsening, China has taken tough measures on containment of the transmission, such as putting epicenter and many other cities on lockdown, keeping it from being exported to other countries, and aggressively tracing anyone the infected were in contact with and quarantining those people for 2 weeks [21] . However, the devastating SARS-CoV2 seems unstoppable to march stealthily toward many more places and shows high possibility to engender another pandemic. These facts suggest that measures taken at present such as infection quarantine and travel restrictions may not be adequate to contain the epidemics, especially, the ones caused by the air-borne viruses aggressing host respiratory system. Vaccines are thought to be the ultimate arsenal enabling people to finally control such SARS-like life-threatening epidemics. As such, researchers are racing against time to develop vaccines that should be promptly available in sufficient quantities for massive use [22] .",

These kinds of vaccines are manufactured thorough production of large volumes of pathogens involving microbe proliferation and egg/cell culture medium preparation, thus engendering a considerable lag time between vaccine development and vaccination conduct [23] . Novel modes of making vaccines tend to focus on purified antigens (Ags), e.g., using Ag-coding DNA and mRNA to develop a nucleic acid vaccine [24] , engineering viruses to deliver whole Ags as a recombinant vaccine, and making expression system to secret Ags for formulating a subunit vaccine [25] . Nucleic acid vaccines can be developed rapidly with the Ag sequence, e.g., an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV2 was developed ready for clinical trial in just 6 weeks from the virus sequence identification. But DNA/mRNA vaccines are rigid in formulating with an adjuvant, which is usually indispensable for enhancing immunostimulatory efficacy of Ags presented alone [26] . Preparation of recombinant virus-vectored vaccines also involves lengthy large-scale culturation of microbes and often takes time long enough to miss the vaccination window of an epidemic [27] . By comparison, subunit vaccines using purified Ags rapidly expressed by a microbial system can be flexibly combined with a vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) to achieve immunization purpose. A VADS can fulfil multiple immunostimulatory functions such as targeting delivery, changing immune response type, and promoting comprehensive cellular as well as humoral reactions [28] . Also, it has been confirmed that mucosal vaccination is most efficient in inducing robust immunity at the administration site [7] . Therefore, various nanoparticulate carriers have been developed as a pulmonary VADS for delivering subunit vaccines but few succeed in taming the highly contagious pathogens, such as SARS and MERS CoVs, which invade hosts via respiratory mucosa [29] .",

The alums in licensed vaccines include aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and potassium aluminum sulfate, all of which can effectively enhance antibody response to vaccines with, however, not-exactly known mechanisms [31] . Whatever aluminum salt is used as an adjuvant, in an aqueous medium, its acid groups will always be substituted to some degree by the anionic hydroxyls [32] . The latter facilitate formation of hydrogen bonds between alum primary nanoparticles, which are thus associated into micrometer clusters engendering a gel-like suspension. The gel-like alum adjuvants may not fit certain administration modes, such as pulmonary vaccination, since their sticky property is likely to cause bronchoalveolar airway obstruction. Moreover, alums have another two disadvantages: they are a strong antibody adjuvant but unable to induce cellular reactions; they sometimes stimulate unacceptable local irritations as side effects [33] . As a result of this, researchers are now making efforts on reformulation of conventional alums to improve their adjuvanticity. In particular, it was found that engineering of alums into special nanostructures, with/without certain materials, such as phospholipid engendering the phospholipid bilayer-coated aluminum nanoparticles (PLANs) and poly(acrylic acid) generating nanorods, can remarkably reduce their local irritating activity while rendering them able to enhance cellular immune responses toward the carried Ags [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . These outcomes inspire us to trial the feasibility of using aluminum nanoparticles (ANs) as a pulmonary VADS for delivering vaccines to elicit strong mucosal immunity against air-borne pathogens, such as SARS-CoV2 and MERS, that incline to infringe and disable human respiratory system.",

We found that ANs facilitated APC (Ag-presenting cell) uptake of vaccines and maturation and rendered vaccines lysosome escape to reduce unwanted degradation of Ags while enhancing MHC-I-Ag presentation. Given to mice via pulmonary administration, ANs safely induced robust humoral as well as cellular immune responses. By contrast, pulmonary administration of micron-sized alum to mice caused serious side effects and even damaged them to death.

To confirm these results, the BMDCs co-incubated with Al-carriers were further subjected to flow cytometry assay. The quantitative analysis results demonstrated that the fraction of the BMDCs had taken up calcein-ANs was remarkably higher than that had taken up calcein-AMs or free calcein (Fig. 2b) . The safety of ANs was evaluated by MTT tests, of which the outcomes indicated that ANs had little influence on viability of macrophages (Raw264.7) (Fig. 2c) .

Because pulmonary vaccination of AMs was noticed of severe cytotoxicity, mice in the alum control group were immunized by subcutaneous injection (s.c.). All the animals were immunized twice with a 3-week interval. ELISA examination revealed that, by pulmonary administration, OVA-ANs were much more efficient than free OVA in inducing synthesis of anti-Ag IgG (Fig. 5a) . Notably, at a high AN dose (OVA/ AN of 1:20), the serum IgG levels in OVA-AN mice even surpassed the levels in s.c. OVA-AM mice after first vaccination but declined significantly after the second vaccination. A similar trend was also observed in vaccine-induced anti-Ag IgG1 and IgG2a, both of which showed lowered levels after second mouse vaccination in either OVA-AN or OVA-AM group ( Fig. 5b and c) . The exact reason for this remains to be fully disclosed but might well be argued relevant to certain side effects associated with pulmonary ANs or s.c. AMs, as mouse bodyweight in either vaccine group seemed to decrease after first immunization (Fig. 5d ). IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes are argued as markers for Th2 and Th1 lymphocytes, respectively, and thus may present some insight into the type of Th cell immune response [45] . IgG2a-to-IgG1 ratio values in mice received OVA-ANs were much higher than that received free OVA or OVA-AMs, suggesting Al-nanocarriers have a tendency to induce a more balanced Th1/Th2 response. This observation was further supported by cytokine assay outcomes, which indicated that mice stimulated by pulmonary OVA-ANs produced more IFN-\u03b3, whereas those triggered by s.c. AMs secreted more IL-4 ( Fig. 5e and f) . Additionally, pulmonary vaccination with AN-delivered OVA triggered mice to generate widespread and robust mucosal immune responses, as revealed by presence of IgA in saliva, nasal and vaginal washes, and, especially, BALF (Fig. 5g) . Although the second pulmonary OVA stimulation also induced mouse production of IgA, this kind of mucosal reaction was limited to respiratory system, i.e., the local sites subjected to vaccination. Unexpectedly, mice receiving twice s.c. OVA-AMs were also evoked to make IgA in saliva, nasal and vaginal washes, as well as BALF, but to a lesser degree compared to that of OVA-AN group.",

The sticky property is apparently resulted from the gels aggregated at administration site and aggravated by secreted mucus leading, possibly, to pulmonary obstruction. Local irritation may arise from actions and disturbance exerted by bulk alum on the contacted cell membranes [46] .

Pulmonary vaccination favors setup of mucosal immunity across most of human organs, especially, the respiratory system and should be particularly beneficial for defending against the airborne pathogens, such as flu, MERS and SARS-CoV2, which is now just rapidly spreading throughout the world [48] . The tendency of ANs to facilitate cellular immunity observed in this report was also specifically described in a previous study, wherein alum was engineered as nanosized rods loaded with the recombinant Fig. 3 a The expression levels of activation biomarkers (CD40, CD80 and CD86) on APCs after stimulation with free OVA, OVA-AMs, or OVA-ANs.

These outcomes support a correlation between the alum size and immunological response [49] , although the underlying mechanism remains still elusive but may well be argued here to function as a resulted of APC internalization of the VADS and Ag lysosomal escape (Fig. 3b) .

In particular, this AN-based VADS effectively turns the adjuvanticity of the first VADS, alum, which has a long history of clinical use but predominantly induces Th2 (T helper 2) type immunity characterized by antibody production and lack of antigen-specific CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) [30, 31, 50] . Notably, the lack of cell-mediated or Th1 immunity makes vaccines ineffective in mounting effective responses against diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, HIV and tumor [51] . Moreover, the highly contagious and dangerous pathogens such as the present rampant SARS-CoV2 may asymptomatically infect a plethora of humans [52] . The asymptomatic virus carriers become stealth resources enormeously facilitating pathogen transmission, which can be interrupted depending, to a large extent, on the availability of the Th1 reaction-inducing vaccines [51] .",

The pulmonary surfactant (PSF) layer is reported to pose a challenge to delivering vaccines to lung APCs by a nanoparticulate VADS vaccines, because the PSF generates a strong barrier to not only pathogen but also nanoparticle accessing mucosa [47, 54] . However, PSF was also described to possess potent adjuvanticities and has been employed as a VADS for enhancing APC uptake and presentation of vaccines [47, 55] . The influence of PSF on the immunostimulatory activity of AN-based pulmonary VADS remains now unclear and deserves obviously a deepening exploration.",
