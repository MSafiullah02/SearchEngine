It studies the perception of relevance of search results for users of Dutch legal IR systems, the employment of usage and citation variables to improve the ranking of search results (bibliometricenhanced information retrieval), and user-centred evaluation for ranking improvements. The goal of this project is improve the ranking in legal IR systems. Ultimately, this will help legal professionals find relevant information faster.",

The user has to choose which of the two results he/she would like to see ranked higher for the query and is asked to provide a reasoning for his/her choice.

The identified factors also suggest that there are document characteristics (e.g. authority, legal hierarchy and whether the document is annotated) that are usually grouped under cognitive or situational relevance, and thereby considered to be personal, but that users in the legal domain agree on.
