During this time John Zachman, often hailed as the father of EA, defined EA as a set of descriptive representations relevant to the enterprise where an enterprise is widely defined as any socio-technical organization [1, 2]. He furthermore proposed the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (ZFEA) that he described as a logical, comprehensive structure \u201cfor classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an Enterprise that are significant to the management of the Enterprise as well as to the development of the Enterprise\u2019s systems, manual systems as well as automated systems\u201d [1].",

However, enterprises often experience challenges with the implementation of EA initiatives and capabilities [23], resulting in sentiments documented mostly in popular press, for instance stating that EA is dead [24, 25]. EA initiatives are often costly and without the expected return on investment. Recent blog posts, for instance, claim that several EA frameworks or tools, specifically the ZFEA, are fake tools without any real value [26]. In their recent 2018 Enterprise Architecture Hype Cycle Gartner found that EA is only now, after more than a decade, emerging from the trough of disillusionment [27].",

EA is relevant for the IS domain as IS is the discipline concerned with studying socio-technical systems, and the view of theory within IS is therefore applicable to EA. Some of the views on IS theory include \u201ctheory as statements that say how something should be done in practice\u201d or \u201ctheory as statements providing a lens for viewing or explaining the world\u201d. The purpose of IS theories is to analyse, predict, explain and/or prescribe and it could be argued that the intent of EA often conforms to these purposes.",

We subsequently adopt the fundamental view about the nature of theories within IS by Gregor. We adopted the taxonomy of theories as well as the structural components of theory within IS as proposed by Gregor [28] to analyse the ZFEA. The main research question answered by this study can be stated as follows: Given the nature and structure of theories within IS, could the ZFEA be considered as a theory? Similar to the method used by Gregor to evaluate five types of theory in IS, we evaluate the ZFEA [28]. By establishing whether ZFEA, and by extension, EA in general, could be regarded as IS theories, we believe that insight on what function EA should fulfil, as well as the use and position of EA and its frameworks and tools, specifically given the strategic developments such as EAM, could be enhanced.",

            "text": "EA originally developed from the need to align the business and information technology aspects of the organisation with one another [12], but has since advanced to be viewed from more than one perspective and for more than one application [10]. EA developed from more than one discipline with differing terminology, seeking mostly similar goals such as organisational alignment, integration, and ability to understand and manage complexity and change [16, 29]. Several definitions for EA exist, such as that EA is the continuous practice of describing the essential elements of a socio\u2010technical organization, their relationships to each other and to the environment, in order to understand complexity and manage change [30]. Urbaczewski and Mrdalj defined EA as a description or blueprint that defines the day-to-day operation and structure of an organization [3], and Zachman himself defined EA as a set of descriptive representations relevant to the enterprise [31]. EA is directed at ensuring that the business with its technologies and resources, as well as the current and future purposes of the organization are aligned. Since its inception, several different EA frameworks were developed from different perspectives and disciplines. Due to space limitations, we will mostly focus on the ZFEA, however, several works on the history, evolution, purpose of, and recent developments within EA are included as references [3, 12, 13, 16, 17, 32\u201338]. In Sect. 4 we analyse the grounding of the EA discipline to motivate the choice of the ZFEA for this paper, and in the next section a short overview of ZFEA is provided.",

Borrowing from the field of engineering, Zachman described how insight into different disciplines and the manufacturing process contributed to the ZFEA [1, 40]. Zachman describes the breakthrough that led to his now well-known ZFEA as the realisation of the existence of different perspectives relevant to a product, which he then applied to an enterprise [39]. The ZFEA was designed after observing that various engineered objects such as computers, buildings and airplanes (the designed artefacts) can be classified according to the fundamental abstractions or interrogatives namely What? How? Where? Who? When? Why?, in columns (Table 1), as well as specific audience perspectives and transformations in rows (Table 2) [1]. The ZFEA (Fig. 1), is therefore a 6 \u00d7 6 two-dimensional classification schema for designing descriptive representations of the enterprise. The ZFEA is also described as an enterprise ontology with no process or tooling implications [41], or a meta-model of an enterprise represented in a matrix comprised of columns and rows. Each intersection of a column and row provides a unique representation or view of the enterprise [1].\n\n\n",

The same is true for predictions, insights into the cause influences the prediction.Generalization: An aspect or characteristic can be applied across a range of specific scenarios, places, people, etc. The degree of generalization determines different viewpoints. Generalization applied to a focused area is required for prediction, as without generalizations about the past or the present, a prediction about the future state is difficult to make. Gregor did not use generalization for classifying theory types.Prediction: Future occurrences are dependent on preconditions to realise.Explanation: Theory aimed at providing understanding on the how, why and when of an occurrence relating to human reasoning and argumentation.\n",

The results of this analysis are summarised in Table 5. These results support the legitimacy of the discipline and support the use of EA as a theoretical base.

The first step is to classify the ZFEA as one of the theory types in the theory taxonomy of Table 3. According to Gregor it is required to look at the primary goals of the theory in order to classify it [28]. The ZFEA is a structural representation or an ontology of an organization and all its elements with their relationships that is descriptive in nature. The ZFEA is directed at providing understanding and insight [58] with no process or tooling specifications [41]. It is depicted as a 6 \u00d7 6 two dimensional schema.",

According to Zachman, the architecture built using the ZFEA schema would necessarily constitute the total set of descriptive representations that are relevant for describing the enterprise [1, 31].

The ZFEA is represented in the form of a framework in order to provide a holistic view, but at the same time provides insights given specific perspectives. Each row, column and cell in the architecture is impacted by another e.g. the technology supports the business processes, the business processes the applications and the applications the strategy. Changes in any model will have an effect on the other models. Changes in strategy (cause) for example, will have an impact (effect) on the rest of the enterprise. All components form part of the whole to provide context. The scope is defined by the subset or component being designed. The ZFEA is described as an ontology and a structural schema that aims to be a repeatable and testable description of an enterprise. It can be argued that the main goals of the ZFEA is aligned to the goals of an explanatory theory since both aim to provide insight, understanding and causal explanations, as well as indicate relationships among components.",

Positioning the ZFEA as IS theory provides insight into the role and purpose of EA and could assist researchers and practitioners with addressing challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations. EA as an explanatory IS theory for organisations also present a new platform, context and therefore perspective, for focussed strategic organisational research. Further research would extend the analysis of EA as IS theory to other frameworks, as well as explore the implications when using EA as theory.
