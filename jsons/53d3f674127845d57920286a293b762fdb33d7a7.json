The hidden transmission phenomenon seems to be especially serious for people suddenly moving from North-to South-Italy in mid-February to reach their families of origin or more comfortable and warmer country houses, just before stricter infection containment measures were taken.

People on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seemed to be at higher risk for clinically severe forms of infection. In fact, based on experimental in vitro studies, human pathogenic coronaviruses bind to target cells though angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and vessels (7) -and the expression of ACE2 is increased in patients with DM people -especially those taking either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) (7) -and in hypertensive people treated with ACE inhibitors ((8-10), as well as, in patients using thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen.

Such information spread fast thus causing serious alarm and anxiety among users worldwide, who urgently asked their own GPs to change antihypertensive prescriptions straight away.

This latter consideration deserves special attention. A higher all-cause hospitalization risk observed in people with DM than in those of comparable age and gender due to the higher prevalence of HF (8%) and respiratory failure (6%) has been reported in clinical records during MERS-CoV (22) and probably is also the case for COVID-19. Available evidence concerning SARS-COV-2 infection features in subjects with DM comes only from data related to infected hospitalized patients, those transferred to the ICUs and death rates. Table 1 summarizes results from main retrospective studies on Wuhan and Hubei / Zhejiang provinces. As already outlined earlier, from available references except for Kui's report (23) the infection seems to mostly affect men. Based on available data, however, there is no possibility to assess whether or not this applies to the DM subpopulation. The percentage range of infected people having DM is 2% to 20% but all studies fail to specify disease type (1 or 2), level of glucose control, home treatment regimen and associated chronic complications. Two of them provide data on ICU admission rate for people with DM: 7.7% (1 out of 13, p = 0.16) in Huang's report (24) and 22.2% (8 out of 36, p = 0.009) in Wang's report (25) . The study from Xu (26) found 39.4% comorbidity (3.0% being represented by DM) in 33 patients being symptomatic for over 10 days since disease onset. The one from Yang (6), conducted on critically ill patients reported that 21.9% non-surviving patients (7 out of 32) vs 10.0% surviving ones (2 out of 20) had DM. Finally, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control, by analyzing 44,672 confirmed infection cases, reported mortality rate to be 2.3% on the whole, 7.3% in people with DM, 10.5% in those with CV disease and 49% in critically ill patients (28) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 546, "end": 550, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2067, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 786, "end": 793, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Concerning diabetes management, another key issue is: how glycemia is managed during hospitalization for COVID-19?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Unfortunately, it is not surprising that patients suffering COVID-19 with hyperglycemia may have a higher risk and a poorer outcome compared with those with euglycemia (29, 30) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 172, "text": "(29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 173, "end": 176, "text": "30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Due to the stress by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to the use of glucocorticoids during hospitalization, patients may suffer from a great glycemic excursion, especially for those with DM (31).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We have also to keep in mind that DM management is not so easy to handle in ill people.

Now, hypoglycemia has been shown to potentiate host's innate immune reaction to endotoxins by mobilizing pro-inflammatory monocytes with negative consequences on cardiovascular mortality (39) . Hyperglycemia has been known for decades to make people susceptible to infections per se by increasing the concentration of several toxic intracellular by-products of the glycolytic pathway (40, 41) . Moreover, during severe illness glucose overloads and damages cells through the up-regulated expression of glucose transporters on their membranes (42) (43) (44) (45) . This means that, despite trying to do their best for infected people, Covid-19-units may even unintentionally end up to make the disease more serious because of glycemic variability. During severe influenza virus infection, pulmonary lesions and mortality are driven by massive cytokine (46) , and adhesion molecule release (47) by pulmonary endothelial cells which allows the uncontrolled extravasation of leukocytes in the alveolus thus severely damaging respiratory function (47, 48) . Glucose variability during the hospitalization may increase these phenomena (38) , so worsening the prognosis. The above-mentioned considerations already suggested the urgent need for all of us to understand how diabetes increases influenza severity in order to mitigate the burden of future influenza epidemics (49) , and even more of present coronavirus pandemic. It deserves attention the fact that large glycemic variability is predictive per se of high ICU mortality (50) . So, it has already been suggested that the management of glucose variability has to be part of the more comprehensive approach to the management of hyperglycemia today: it seems that this has to be urgently applied in intensive care units (51) (52) .
