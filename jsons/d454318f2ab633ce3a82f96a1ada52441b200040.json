This work has been based on the use of cell culture systems, although our knowledge of some viruses, such as papilloma viruses and hepatitis B virus, is based on sequence analysis only. In contrast, molecular mechanisms of multiplication in the animal host, and the interactions of the virus with the host to produce disease (i.e. pathogenesis) have been largely neglected. Often, viruses which exhibit similar mechanisms of multiplication in cell culture differ in the type of disease induced in the animal host. An example is the picornavirus family: although foot-and-mouth disease, hepatitis A, polio and rhino (common cold) viruses are similar in their multiplication strategies in cell cultures, the diseases produced in their animal hosts are quite different. Until recently, studies of viral pathogenesis were largely descriptive but, due to the introduction of new techniques, it is now possible to approach the problem of the genetic control of pathogenesis at the molecular level. For RNA viruses, these techniques have been the use of nucleic acid and antibody probes, complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing and the construction of infectious clones.",

The sequence of the entire virus genome is required: cDNA fragments are then joined in the correct order, to give a DNA copy of the virus genome. Using a suitable expression plasmid, a bacteriophage promotor (usually derived from SP6 or T7) is placed adjacent to the virus genome. The cDNA corresponding to the virus genome may then be transcribed in vitro using the appropriate RNA polymerase, to give infectious RNA. This RNA is used to infect cultured cells, either by chemical transfection or electroporation, and infectious virus produced.",

Two reovirus serotypes are used as models: type 1 and type 3. After intracerebral inoculation into neonatal mice, type 3 produces a lethal meningoencephalitis. which typically includes extensive damage to neurons. In contrast, type 1 does not damage neurons, but infects the ependymal cells lining the ventricles and produces ependymitis. Infected animals also frequently develop hydrocephalus. Analysis of reassortment has demonstrated that the cell tropism of reovirus (i.e. ability to infect neurons or ependymal cells) is determined by the virus S1 gene, which is a distinct genome segment. This gene codes for the sigma outer capsid protein, and is also the protein which recognizes the reovirus cell receptor [87, 881 The S 1 gene also determines the mechanism of spread of the virus following inoculation into the hindlimb of neonatal mice. Both type 1 and type 3 reovirus spread to the spinal cord following hindlimb inoculation. However, for type 3 this spread is through axonal transport, whereas for type 1 it is haematogenous [82] .",

Ts mutants will multiply at a permissive temperature, but multiplication is restricted at a higher, nonpermissive temperature. The basis of such mutations is usually a missense substitution of an amino acid in the affected protein, resulting from a single base change. Such mutations usually attenuate the pathogenicity of the virus. Thus for virulent virus, such mutation may allow survival of the affected animals due to reduced multiplication rate of the virus. Such mutations may occur in several virus genes 1651. However, one effect of ts mutations may be to unmask pathogenic characteristics which are obscured by death in the case of the more virulent wild-type strain.",

Infection of neonatal mice leads to life-long persistent infection. which is due to immune tolerance of the virus. For adult mice. infection leads either to death or viral clearance. Persistence occurs in most tissues of the mouse: in the CNS, persistent infection of the pituitary results in stunting of growth due to inhibition of growth hormone secretion. The infection of the pituitary is not cytolytic and can only be detected through the use of nucleic acid and antibody probes. This has led to a new concept in viral pathogenicity: inhibition of 'household' functions, such as protein and nucleic acid synthesis, leads to cell death: however, inhibition of 'luxury' functions, such as growth hormone synthesis, allows cell survival but affects the viability of the animal [ 3 2 ] . Although this may be a general disease mechanism, this concept should be interpreted with caution, as LCM virus causes an unusual infection, and there is as yet no evidence that such mechanisms operate in human disease.",

Using this sequence information, infectious clones have been constructed for these three strains of virus [18, 29, 45, 68, 801. These infectious clones have been used to construct recombinant (chimeric) virus and hence to map viral genes controlling neurovirulence, persistence and demyelination, by fragment exchange. The results indicate that all three phenotypes are determined by the capsid proteins of the virus [6, 10, 13, 17, 18, 46, 791. The observation that the 5' non-translated region is important in the determination of neurovirulence first appeared to be due to an inadvertent base deletion which occurred during the construction of chimeric virus [64] .

However, it was later shown using the polymerase chain reaction, a more sensitive method, that low levels of Sindbis virus RNA do persist in the CNS after clearance of infectious virus [36]. This low-level persistence does not appear to be associated with any detectable clinical signs, and the significance of this finding is not clear at present, A laboratory strain of Sindbis virus has been sequenced and an infectious clone produced [66] . A single amino acid change in the E2 protein controls virulence. This change affects the binding of the virus to mouse brain cells [81] .

The main model systems used so far have been Theiler's virus, Sindbis virus and SFV.

The use of adult animals in infection experiments, and avoidance of intracerebral inoculation, allows the study of the interaction of the virus with a fully developed immune system and the use of natural routes of infection, but this may not be possible for some systems. So far, the work has been confined to sequence analysis. Two types of mutation have been analysed. Mutations which impair the function of a viral protein attenuate the virus, but may lead to the unmasking of pathogenic mechanisms which are obscured by death for virulent viruses. Mutations which do not impair virus multiplication but determine cell tropism and hence disease syndromes have also been described, and are of fundamental importance in understanding the molecular control of pathogenicity. Such mutations have so far only been described in genes coding for viral structural proteins. The study of structure-function relationships between viral and cellular nucleic acids and proteins, and their rBle in pathogenesis, is just beginning. ",
