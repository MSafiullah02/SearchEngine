It is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), named SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with a 15% fatality rate (World Health Organization). Over the next 2 years, the discovery of two more species of human CoV, NL-63 and HCoV-HKU1, confirmed the high mutation rate of coronaviruses [2], [3]. Recent isolation of SARS-CoV like strains from bats further raises the possibility of a reemergence of SARS or a related disease [4], [5]. All of these findings result in an urgent need to understand these viruses and their encoded proteins better.",

Both proteases are suitable antiviral targets because they are essential for viral maturation [7], [8]. Besides the proteolytic activity that is common to the main protease, PLpro also showed significant deubiquitinating (DUB) and de-ISGylating activities with obscure biological functions [9]. Recently, cellular assays have also suggested that coronaviral PLpro is able to antagonize the induction of type I interferon, which is independent of its protease and DUB activity [10]. All of these studies support the multifunctional nature of the PLpro and suggested that these independent activities may provide multiple targets for antiviral therapies.",

Both of them share a papain-like fold that contains palm, thumb, and fingers domains (Fig. 1\nA). The active site of PLpro is located within the palm and thumb domains consisting of a catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues [9]. A four-strand anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet makes up the \u201cfingers\u201d domain. Within the fingertips region there are four cysteine residues coordinating to a zinc ion. Mutation of the zinc-coordinating cysteines caused a significant loss of enzymatic activity and this suggests that the zinc-binding ability is essential for its enzymatic function [9].",

This substrate is cleaved at the Gly\u2013pNA bond to release free pNA, which turns the color of the solution to yellow. The increase in absorbance at 405 nm was continuously monitored using a Jasco V-550 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). The amount of pNA released by proteolysis can be calculated using a standard curve generated with analytical grade pNA and the results are consistent with those reported in the literature (A\n405 nm\n = 9.8 at 1 mM) [13]. The protease activity assay was performed in 50 mM phosphate (pH 7.4) at 30 \u00b0C. The substrate stock solution was made up at 4 mM and the working concentrations were from 0.5 to 3.5 mM.

Initially we analyzed the catalytic activities of PLpro with and without the Ub like domain. Their kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1\n. The k\ncat of PLpro-(1600\u20131858) is slightly higher than that of PLpro-(1541\u20131858), while the K\nm of PLpro-(1541\u20131858) is about 2.5-fold lower and k\ncat/K\nm is twofold higher.

The results suggested that the PLpro-(1600\u20131858) fragment, which contains the palm, thumb, and zinc-finger domain (Fig. 1A), is sufficient and active in terms of catalysis.

As a result of this preliminary finding, chemical denaturation was chosen to analyze PLpro unfolding. Under the excitation at 280 nm, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the native enzyme shows a maximum at 346 nm (Supplemental Fig. 1, solid curve). In the presence of 7 M urea, the enzyme was completely unfolded after 1 h and the maximum emission had shifted to 357 nm (Supplemental Fig. 1, short dashed curve). After 50-fold dilution of the urea and incubation for 10 min, refolding of the enzyme was induced to give a yield of 88% as judged by the fluorescence spectrum recovery (Supplemental Fig. 1, dotted curve).

Similarly, the fluorescence emission peak showed a monophasic red shifting from 345 to 360 nm (Fig. 2C).

Further interesting results are shown in Fig. 2D, where there is an obvious biphasic red shift of the AEW from 349 to 352 nm upon increasing the urea. The data fit to the three-state unfolding model very well, which suggest that the folded enzyme started to unfold at a very few urea and reached the first unfolding intermediate with a [Urea]0.5,N\u2212I at 0.35 M.

The tryptophan fluorescence thus is an excellent tool to probe the unfolding of the thumb and palm domain (Fig. 2E). A monophasic unfolding process with a [Urea]0.5,N\u2212U at 4.7 M similar to those from CD and fluorescence peak shifting indicated that the unfolding of the catalytic core occurs during the second transition (Table 2).

Furthermore, the shape distributions of the PLpro\u2019s major species at various urea concentrations were analyzed in terms of their f/f\n0 distribution (Fig. 3, color contour). The f/f\n0 of the native PLpro was between 1 and 3, while that of the most concentrated region (shown by red) was below 1.5. Before the second unfolding phase (1\u20133.5 M urea), the broad f/f\n0 distribution of the major species suggested a tendency to elongate among the unfolding process, which is similar to that of the SARS-CoV main protease in guanidinium chloride [14]. Based on previous studies, the partial unfolding intermediate may represent a molten globule state with exposure of the interior hydrophobic area, which will allow a pronounced binding of ANS, a broad f/f\n0, and higher propensity to aggregate [14], [27]. Indeed, at lower protein concentrations of PLpro (<6.5 \u03bcM), there is significant aggregation at 3.5 M urea. The ANS binding activity of the urea-unfolded enzyme also showed a significant hydrophobic region exposure between 3 and 4 M urea (Supplemental Fig. 4). All of these results support the presence of a major intermediate form detectable at urea concentrations between 1 and 3.5 M that may only represent a molten globule state after 2.5 M urea. Thus, during the first unfold state and the first half of the intermediate state, the possibility remains that differential domain stability occurs. Above 4.7 M urea, the PLpro showed a sedimentation coefficient of 1.0\u20131.5 and the f/f\n0 of the most concentrated region was close to 2 (Fig. 3). The small sedimentation coefficient and large f/f\n0 suggested a totally unfolded protein structure [14], [16].",

            "text": "Enzymatic activity change during urea unfolding was examined. The results shown in Fig. 3 (circles) are those for residual enzyme activity by the peptide cleavage assay and similar results were obtained by the DUB assays (data not shown). Interestingly, the enzyme activity began to decrease at very low urea concentrations (50% left at 0.5 M urea). By the time that 1.1 M urea has been reached, there was only 20% of the original activity left. Besides, to identify the influence of endogenous zinc ion, the enzyme activity was also examined in various concentrations of EDTA. The activity was 90% in 10 mM, 50% in 50 mM, while the lowest one was 38% left in 100 mM EDTA. These results support the hypothesis that the first transition, which is caused by the unfolding of zinc-binding site, already has a great deal of influence on activity even when the active core domain still remains folded. According to the modeled structure by Ratia et al. [11], the finger region of PLpro may be used to cradle the body of ubiquitin. It suggested that the zinc-binding site may stabilize the finger region and its unfolding can be detrimental to substrate binding and cause the loss of the activity. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that the structural integrity of zinc-binding site is essential for the enzyme activity [9], [11].",

            "text": "In summary, our studies have revealed the reversible unfolding/refolding process of the PLpro in the presence of urea (Fig. 4\n). The zinc-binding domain of the enzyme may start to unfold at urea concentration below 0.35 M and reaches a first plateau at 1\u20133.5 M. At this stage, the palm and thumb core domains remain well folded but totally inactive. Remove of zinc ion from the enzyme will cause the tertiary structure more unstable and a two-state unfolding. This supports the hypothesis that the zinc-binding domain can stabilize the structure and is essential for the catalysis [9]. As the urea concentration is increased above 3.5 M, the unfolding of the palm and thumb domain then starts and this involves significant hydrophobic exposure and is completed at 7.5 M urea. This schematic representation only includes the major enzyme species that occur during the folding process. Specifically, PLpro displays a differential stability in terms of the protein\u2019s domain structures and a molten globule state is present at the beginning of palm and thumb domain unfolding. Differential domain stability can also be seen in SARS-CoV main protease, while other proteins, such as human alkaline phosphatase, human apolipoprotein E, and malic enzyme have been shown to undergo a significant molten globule transition state during the unfolding process [14], [16], [28], [29]. Our unfolding studies on SARS-CoV PLpro will not only assist in our understanding of the structure folding of this important viral enzyme, but also that of other DUB enzymes with a similar scaffold but low sequence identities, such as HAUSP, USP-2, USP-14 etc. [30], [31], [32], [33].",
