In many cases, the pattern of disease indicates an infectious aetiology, but no causative agents are identified by traditional laboratory investigations. Previous examinations of neonatal diarrhoea in Danish and Swedish herds suggested that Enterococcus spp., rotavirus A and E. coli carrying EAST1 virulence genes might be of significance [1\u20133]. Other studies suggest that Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and C. perfringens type A containing beta2 toxin gene (CPA cpb2) may be relevant to investigate further in relation to neonatal diarrhoea [4\u20136].",

Rotavirus C was not included due to earlier studies indicating a very low prevalence and no association with neonatal diarrhoea in Danish and Swedish herds [1, 7, 8]. As no PED or TGE outbreaks have been described in Denmark, coronaviruses were not investigated. In order to obtain a clear definition of a diarrhoeic case vs. a non-diarrhoeic control we used a combination of clinical and pathological examinations.",

Rotavirus A is by many considered ubiquitous in suckling piglets, but previous Danish studies have shown that the prevalence within the first week of life can be very low [16]. Studies focusing on the possible viral aetiology of the newly described phenomenon New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) conclude that viruses do not seem to pose a significant contribution to diarrhoeal symptoms in affected herds [7, 16]. However, these herds (four in Denmark and ten in Sweden) were selected as representative for a new type of diarrhoea not caused by known agents, including rotavirus A [1]. In the present study, we did not focus on NNPDS and did not exclude any herds due to presence of rotavirus A. Instead, we included a large number (60) of different herds in order to get a broader picture of diarrhoeal aetiologies in neonatal pigs. Interestingly, our findings support a recent study in two Danish herds. In that study, examining samples from 132 neonatal piglets, 89% of diarrhoeic piglets vs. 48% of non-diarrhoeic piglets were rotavirus A positive by PCR [2]. Taken together, these results suggest that rotavirus A has an important clinical significance in neonatal piglets, although the prevalence of case herds may be rather low as indicated by the low prevalence (18%) shown in this study.",

The low herd-pool prevalence of E. coli fimbrial genes, including the previously clinically important F4 gene that was not detected at all, and the fact that C. perfringens type C was not detected at all probably reflects a successful vaccination scheme. Also, antibiotics used as metaphylaxis in some of the herds and the Danish breeding programme for F4 resistant pigs [17] could have an influence on the absence of F4 positive E. coli. STb was the only ETEC-associated toxin gene detected at a relatively high prevalence (19% of herd pools were positive). Whether a result of vaccination or not, E. coli results in this study support laboratory surveillance data indicating that ETEC are no longer dominant agents in neonatal diarrhoea [5, 18].

Few studies have evaluated the possible role of EAST1 and AIDA-1 in neonatal diarrhoea. A Danish study found that 48% of diarrhoeic vs. 18% of non-diarrhoeic neonatal piglets were positive for EAST1. In one of the investigated herds in this study, ten out of ten diarrhoeic piglets were positive for EAST1 [1].Vu-Khac et al. detected EAST1 genes in 65% of E. coli isolates from diarrhoeic piglets vs. 27% of isolates from non-diarrhoeic ones [19]. Other studies did not find any association between the detection of EAST1 and diarrhoea [20\u201322]. Previous studies on AIDA-1 found a quite low prevalence (3\u201317%) in isolates from diarrhoeic suckling piglets [20, 21, 23\u201325]. Two of these studies included non-diarrhoeic specimens and did not detect AIDA-1 in any of those [20, 21]. The current study provides limited information on the piglet level, as only 45 piglets from toxin and adhesin positive pools were individually tested as cases and controls. However, EAST1 being present in 55% of individually tested case piglets with the majority being positive for AIDA-1 also, supports relevance of further investigation of the role of these virulence factors in neonatal diarrhoea.",

For many years, C. perfringens type A has been a suspected pathogen in neonatal diarrhoea, but no studies have convincingly supported this claim. One study demonstrated a (minor) cytotoxic effect of supernatant from porcine CPA cpb2, but also showed that the cytotoxic effect was not related to beta2 toxin [35]. Thus, that study suggests that the potential role of C. perfringens type A in neonatal diarrhoea is not due to its ability to produce beta2 toxin. Investigations into the diarrhoea-causing capability of other toxins produced by C. perfringens type A may be relevant.",
