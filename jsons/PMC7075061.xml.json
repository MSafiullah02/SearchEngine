Measures for large-scale public awareness regarding the standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular handwashing; covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing; thoroughly cooking meat and eggs; avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing; and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth. Previous experience from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks suggests that hospitals and healthcare facilities have amplified disease spread; hence, there has to be a special emphasis on higher level measures such as healthcare preparedness, large-scale isolation facilities, and quarantine facilities. The CDC and the WHO guidelines suggest that stringent infection control measures are critical to preventing transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. Standard measures such as hand hygiene and use of chlorhexidine with 70% isopropyl alcohol for hand rub, use of personal protective equipment with triple layer mask or N95 mask, along with education regarding proper disposal of the these equipment should be instituted in healthcare facilities. Since the virus stays on surfaces, efficient surface cleaning with standard 1% hypochlorite solution is recommended. Standard droplet precautions (e.g., surgical or procedure mask, gown, and gloves) are indicated during the treatment of all CoV patients, and such protocols for droplet-spread respiratory viruses should be part of hospital infection control practices. Additional respiratory precautions are needed during aerosol-generating procedures.",

Meanwhile, all the 645 Indian nationals who were evacuated from Wuhan tested negative for infection. The Indian Government has to set up a task force to monitor the situation arising out of the nCoV, with representatives from the Ministries of Health, Home, Civil Aviation, and Women and Child Development. A round-the-clock control room at the Directorate General of Health Services\u2019 headquarters is set up to address queries related to the virus. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website displays the information and notices related to the novel COVID-19 outbreak, which is of help to the travelers and health professionals along with contact details (Fig. 1).10 The Government of India is closely monitoring the development of nCoV while providing isolation, testing, and quarantine facilities. The Government of India has issued an advisory for Indian citizens not to travel to China.",

The best way to protect the noninfected population is vaccination. We have come a long way since Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine against smallpox (1796), employing what appears to be a very crude method now. The human genome project mapped complete genome sequence, a milestone in human history (April 14, 2001). This has prepared us for future challenges. Codagenics, a USA firm, and Serum Institute of India, have entered into a partnership, to rapidly codevelop a vaccine for COVID-19.11 Many such efforts are ongoing and it is estimated that the vaccine will be available within the next 6 months, signaling another triumphal milestone in human history.",
