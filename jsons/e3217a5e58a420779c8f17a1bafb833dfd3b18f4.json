While a large number of international stakeholders now consider the One Health approach necessary for more effective protection of the global community against health threats, there is still no systematic allocation of resources to integrated national or multinational programmes, partly due to the inertia of existing sectoral systems and the lack of convincing economic arguments in support of the approach. We propose different degrees of sectoral integration depending on system types and associated economic efficiency gains to be expected from a One Health approach.

            "text": "One Health is often presented as an approach to mitigate risks to human health arising from microorganisms harboured in non-human animal species, which have the potential to infect and cause disease in humans. These microorganisms include known pathogens as well as hitherto unknown existing microorganisms capable of infecting humans or capable of evolving into human-infective forms under favourable circumstances. For the purpose of this chapter, emerging diseases are defined as a previously undefined (unknown) condition, which may result from the evolution or change in an existing infectious agent causing a change of strain, host range, vector or increase in virulence, or may be the occurrence of any other previously undefined condition (Hoinville et al. 2011) . Given the alarming number and serious consequences of human pathogen emergence from animal reservoirs over the past decades (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE; Nipah virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS; highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI H5N1; and influenza A H1N1), the rationale behind the concept of One Health, namely promotion of a more harmonised and integrated approach to investigate, plan for, and react to mitigate zoonotic disease risks, is appealing. During the last five years there has been a growing momentum, particularly from the international community, requesting that health research, systems and services implement a One Health approach. The reaction from people working in the health professions has been polarised, the majority of those working in the human health sector have not engaged with One Health, 1 whereas the majority of professionals working in animal and environmental health are interested in the approach, and some recognise its value. One Health advocates assume, a priori, that a more holistic management of microbial health hazards would result in a more efficient use of the scarce resources available for mitigation of disease risk. This paper aims to contribute to the One Health debate by using an economics assessment framework, in order to find ways of moving forward the agenda and engagement. In this exploration, we will limit ourselves largely to the mitigation 2 of zoonotic disease risks, recognising that a similar approach should be extended to noncommunicable diseases of humans and to production diseases in animals.",

A change from a traditional sectoral approach of health management to a holistic One Health approach needs to compare the marginal benefits against the marginal costs of such a change. The final outcome of One Health initiatives is the avoidance or reduction of disease in humans and animals-an outcome that can be measured in technical terms (e.g. number of human cases averted, reduction of prevalence in animal population) and translated into values using established economic quantification methods. The value of an activity or its impact may be reflected by market prices, e.g. health treatment expenditures or production losses avoided. But often, One Health risk mitigation activities result in nonmarket outcomes such as avoidance of human distress or death, feelings of consumer confidence, improved animal welfare or conservation of an animal species, which do not have a market value but nevertheless can be measured using one of the many approaches available in economic theory, such as contingent valuation.",

However neoclassical economics, a dominant school of thought in economic theory that investigates resource allocation by means of supply and demand models in relation to subjective preferences of producers and consumers, has some important limitations. It tends to oversimplify the fluid nature of resources, by assuming that resources are completely divisible and available timelessly. It also underplays that market prices for resources are often distorted through public and private rule structures.",

Without such investments, One Health field level initiatives are likely to remain interesting projects rather than paradigm shifts, and economic analysis may well undervalue the larger scale benefits of a more comprehensive paradigm shift.",

The evidence presented is summarised in a section of discussion and conclusions with the intention of identifying where economics in the future can improve understanding of societal health management and what factors in One Health need to be strengthened to achieve this.",

The factors reported to be influencing emergence include human population and behaviour changes, increasing livestock production, intensification of production, trade, habitat change, loss of biodiversity, and globalisation (McMichael 2004; Morse 2004) . In the next sections, disease emergence is described in more detail. 5 To the authors' knowledge all countries continue to have separate Ministries of Health and Agriculture, the latter includes animal health. Many OECD countries have consumer protection agencies, but these tend not to work closely across sectors. At international level the UN continues to have WHO and FAO supported by OIE. While a tripartite agreement for One Health exists between these international organisations there are few programmes or projects with significant budget and actions that are truly One Health.",

Only after each component is assessed and modelled will the outcomes be combined.

(B) A wide range of One Health projects aim to detect, combat and/or prevent emerging disease, which by definition is unknown. It is impossible to collect data about something that has not occurred yet and no empirical data will be available about the type of a pathogen emerging, nor its geographic location, host preference, virulence, infectivity or transmission pathways, and of greatest importance whether such a pathogen will establish itself in humans. Therefore, any model attempting to predict what might happen will have to draw on expert assessment, educated guesswork and bio-prospecting/screening of putative sources of pathogens and exposed human population groups.

Where similar structures in terms of logistics, personnel and materials are required by multiple programmes running concurrently, resources can be shared and in some cases saved by intersectoral partnering. Such cost-sharing initiatives serve to reduce the investment required in individual programmes, thus increasing the efficiency of a programme. (2) One Health risk mitigation programmes for endemic zoonotic diseases. Strategic higher level budgetary and resource allocation provides sufficient financing to control disease along the livestock value chain and leads to benefits in humans. This requires a proactive and preventative approach to disease management and recognition that disease can be managed further upstream, which requires significant shifts in resource allocation. Mitigation activities are introduced at multiple points encompassing multiple sectors or in one specific population only with financial contribution from the other sector. (3) One Health surveillance and response for early detection of emerging, reemerging or exotic zoonotic pathogens. Recent experiences with emerging zoonotic diseases have demonstrated their potential for major impact on human and animal populations, either directly due to morbidity and mortality in animals or humans, or indirectly due to response to disease, control measures, effect on trade or fear of disease and associated behaviour change. This has stimulated the creation of interdisciplinary partnerships for integrated surveillance and/or rapid response for future emerging disease threats Fig. 1 Overview of one health zoonotic disease risk mitigation programmes that have particular characteristics in terms of their economic efficiency (King et al. 2004 ). If such partnerships are well coordinated, a (re-)emerging or exotic disease may be detected early before it has spread widely, making it easier and less costly to contain. (4) One Health activities to prevent zoonotic disease emergence and establishment. The ultimate goal of zoonotic disease risk mitigation is to prevent emergence and subsequent establishment through One Health or Ecohealth approaches. Ecohealth takes One Health further by examining changes in the biological, physical, social and economic environments and relates these changes to human health. To prevent disease emergence, risky environments, contacts and behaviours must be modified in a way to decrease the probability of zoonotic disease emergence. This requires not only knowledge about factors for disease emergence, but also a willingness of service providers to invest resources in activities that have a highly uncertain outcome. If successful, the benefits from avoiding zoonotic disease emergence are potentially very large.",

For veterinary medicine the generation of public goods depends on the nature of the intervention (De Haan and Umali 1992) and there is a grey area that relates to externalities (Leonard 2010; Rushton and Leonard 2009 ). Within the grey area the ability of livestock to provide improved livelihood outcomes to the poor has been recognised (Randolph et al. 2007 ) and the link between improvements in livelihoods and improvements in health is well established (Smith 1999) . Veterinary interventions, which are diagnostic or curative, contain a public good component when considered at the level of the smallholder or pastoralist. People living in such systems are more likely to be living in areas of poor infrastructure, be less well informed about health issues, have a lower capacity to bear the risk presented by disease (McDermott et al. 1999) and are therefore most in need of basic medical and veterinary services. In addition, the proximity in which these people live to their animals puts them at particular risk of zoonotic disease transmission. One Health represents an opportunity to build the capacity of medical and veterinary service provision in such situations.",

In Chad, a joint vaccination programme for humans and cattle had a higher human uptake particularly among women and children when animal vaccination was being offered concurrently Schelling et al. 2005) . It also provided an opportunity for contact between public health services and nomads, many of whom had never previously visited a health centre. Similar effects have been observed in South Sudan, when polio and rinderpest vaccinations were offered simultaneously (Ward et al. 1993) . Since vaccination campaigns are typified by high initial set-up costs but reduced marginal costs as coverage is extended, increasing coverage represents an increase in economic efficiency as the cost per animal vaccinated decreases and the threshold for herd immunity is reached. Schelling et al. (2007) describe the results of a cost-sharing initiative between medical and veterinary vaccination campaigns in rural Chad. Mobile veterinary vaccination teams already visited pastoral livestock keepers in this area to administer veterinary vaccines; as a result a joint human-livestock campaign was initiated utilising the existing personnel and infrastructure to deliver vaccination for anthrax, blackleg, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and pasteurellosis for animals, and pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria and polio for humans in a single campaign. An evaluation of costs indicated a 15 % reduction in operational costs compared with separate vaccination campaigns.",

Integrated surveillance in all three host populations was conducted throughout the programme allowing data to be collected on which the programme could be evaluated and resources redeployed in a reactive manner.

Economic analyses found that by year 8 of the programme, the cumulative benefit-cost ratio had exceeded 1, indicating costs had been recouped.

Such a system requires clear leadership and coordination, common goals and objectives, data collection tools for human, domestic and wild animal diseases, integration of data collation and analysis, integrated contingency plans and good communication from field to central level and between disciplines. The common rationale for establishing early warning surveillance systems is the expectation that the early detection of disease reduces subsequent outbreak response expenditure and disease losses. In other words, surveillance and intervention are, to a large extent, seen as economic substitutes. The technical rate of substitution and their relative costs of provision then determine their least-cost combinations (Howe et al. 2012) . that should be compared to the level of value loss avoidance to determine optimal or acceptable levels of resource use. For One Health early warning surveillance, there will be an initial investment to integrate existing surveillance and response systems (or in rare cases to set up a completely new system) and recurring expenditure for the maintenance of the system.

For emerging disease outbreaks, general structures such as leadership, communication channels and epidemiological investigations may be foreseen, while specific risk mitigation activities need to be tailored according to the hazard. Further, data on disease transmission and spread, such as incidence, the number of humans, holdings and animals affected are needed to estimate disease losses and the magnitude of the response. Data gathered during past outbreaks provide the necessary information for ex post analysis, while mathematical simulation models can be used to make predictions on disease transmission and spread in animal and human populations for ex ante analyses.

If risks are recognised as negligible at an early stage unnecessary action, overreaction and wasteful resource use can be prevented. If the risk is not negligible, a timely and effective response may contain zoonotic disease outbreaks rapidly and avert disease losses.

This is likely to be a consequence of each individual event being rare as such and even more so in combination, i.e. for a mutation to produce a viable and pathogenic variant, it becoming exposed to a suitable and susceptible host, which in turn occurs at densities that allow establishment of infection within that host's local population, and which is then connected to other populations of susceptible hosts of the same or other species at the meta-population level. Any predictions in relation to occurrence of emerging infectious disease are therefore subject to high uncertainty. But based on current understanding of the relative importance of different biological, environmental and socio-economic drivers, it is likely that regions with high density domestic animal populations particularly of pigs and poultry have an important role as potential source for genetic change in pathogens as well as for amplification of new and mutated pathogens introduced from other populations, such as wild animals. The frequency and velocity (travelling time is shorter than the incubation period) of medium-to long-distance movement of animals, animal products and humans is the key parameter for spread and therefore important for successful establishment of an emerging pathogen at meta-population level. These basic principles allow the definition of risk management practices which should reduce the risk of emergence. Suitable practices include improved management of ecosystems at all levels taking into account molecular, cellular, host, species and environmental characteristics and interactions.",

Data collected during past emergence events can inform economic and mathematical models to assess the economic efficiency of such initiatives in ex ante analyses. The consequences of emergence of infectious diseases have been modelled by various authors, in particular for diseases such as SARS, influenza A H5N1, H1N1 and BSE. In most cases, this referred to spread within the human population. The usage of the model predictions for policy development presented a significant challenge due to the large degree of uncertainty in relation to biological mechanisms and their quantitative parameter values (Becker et al. 2005; Ferguson et al. 2006; Ferguson and Donnelly 2003; Relman et al. 2010) .

(2) How entrenched are the animal and human health services in their own systems?

While economic evaluations can be carried out for the first two types of One Health collaboration, economic assessment of the efficiency of integrated surveillance systems is severely complicated by the uncertainty surrounding disease emergence or introduction and subsequent disease spread. The available literature is largely theoretical and focuses on the balance between the marginal cost of the additional surveillance effort and the marginal reduction of expected damage. The latter will not only depend on the timeliness of disease detection but also on the effectiveness of the outbreak response. In a large number of countries, outbreak response mechanisms are weak and as a result the benefits of early detection may be minimal. Enhancing surveillance through intersectoral integration therefore only provides the expected efficiency gains if response capacity of the animal and human health sectors is sufficiently developed or if surveillance investments are accompanied by concurrent investments in disease response capabilities.",

            "text": "One Health disease management measures should not only aim to reduce the likelihood of emergence of highly virulent pathogens, such as influenza viruses, but also take into account 'low profile' pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni. This pathogen has become one of the most costly human health hazards associated with the livestock industries in developed countries, responsible for more than 10,000 hospitalisations per year in the USA alone (Mead et al. 1999) . Another phenomenon warranting One Health attention is the increased prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes in pathogens and commensals of animals as these can be transferred to microbes of humans through horizontal gene transfer (Smillie et al. 2011; Witte 2000) . In the USA infection with resistant microbes has been estimated to be associated with an 11-day increase of hospitalization, increasing medical costs per patient by around US $20,000, while societal costs were estimated to amount to around US $60,000 per patient (Roberts et al. 2009 ). The usage of antimicrobials in animals and humans is regulated fairly effectively in developed countries. In contrast, in the parts of the world currently experiencing the highest levels of growth in animal production, particularly in Asia, drugs are commonly traded illegally, used inappropriately or may be tainted, all of which will increase the risk of antibiotic resistance emerging. While the magnitude of these impacts suggest that closer cooperation between human and animal health sectors to mitigate risks may be beneficial, only systematic economic appraisal will demonstrate its economic efficiency and guide the allocation of resources across sectors.",

At the institutional level it is clear that the broadening of health management and the creation of safer, more disease resilient agricultural landscapes goes beyond the veterinary and human medical services. Extending the efforts towards sustainable agriculture and rural development, environment protection and socio-economic development entails involvement of many institutional stakeholders, requiring a major challenge in terms of fostering partnerships and communication. Moving One Health forward may not require new organisations, but it does require new institutional rules of organisation. It may also not require major additional funding, but it will require different means in how funding is distributed and managed. Such changes are not cost free, and these costs need to be estimated and compared with the benefits gained in terms of better disease management and prevention.",
