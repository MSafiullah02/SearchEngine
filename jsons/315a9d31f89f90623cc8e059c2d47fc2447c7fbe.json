            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes high mortality in neonatal piglets. The PEDV spike (S) protein contains two intracellular sorting motifs, Yxx\u233d (tyrosine-based motif YEVF or YEAF) and KVHVQ at the cytoplasmic tail, yet their functions have not been fully elucidated. Some Vero cell-adapted and/or attenuated PEDV variants contain ablations in these two motifs. We hypothesized that these motifs contribute to viral pathogenicity. By transiently expressing PEDV S proteins with mutations in the motifs, we confirmed that the motif KVHVQ is involved in retention of the S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In addition, we showed that the Yxx\u233d motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins. These two motifs synergistically regulate the level of S expressed on the cell surface. To investigate their role in viral pathogenicity, we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing deletions or a mutation in the two motifs of the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A): (i) ic\u039410aa (\u0394Yxx\u233dEKVHVQ), (ii) ic\u03945aa (\u0394KVHVQ), and (iii) icYA (Y1378A, to an inactivated motif, AEVF). Infection of Vero cells with ic\u039410aa resulted in larger syncytia and more virions, with reduced numbers of S protein projections on the surface compared with icPC22A. Furthermore, we orally inoculated five groups of 5-day-old gnotobiotic piglets with the three mutants, icPC22A, or a mock treatment. Mutant ic\u039410aa caused less severe diarrhea rate and significantly milder intestinal lesions than icPC22A, ic\u03945aa, and icYA. These data suggest that the deletion of both motifs can reduce the virulence of PEDV in piglets.",

Our results explain one attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants lacking functional Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ motifs.

The amounts of PEDV S proteins in the ERGIC, in other organelles, or on the cell surface are likely regulated by two nearby motifs in its cytoplasmic tail (CT): a tyrosine-based motif, Yxx\u233d (x is any residue and \u233d is a bulky hydrophobic residue: F, M, I, L, or V), and an ER retrieval signal (ERRS), KVHVQ (10) (11) (12) (13) , as well as other viral and cellular proteins. The CoV ERRS, either in the dilysine or the dibasic form (KxKxx, KKxx, or KxHxx), is a weak ERGIC retention signal (14, 15) . It interacts with coatomer complex I (COPI), a cellular protein involved in cargo transportation from the Golgi to ER, and prevents large amounts of the S proteins from being transported to the cell surface through the canonical secretory pathway (16, 17) . In addition, the ERRS in the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) promotes the interaction between S and M proteins in the Golgi region (16) . Inactivation of the ERRS in the SARS-CoV S protein impaired its incorporation into virus-like particles when coexpressed with the M in the cells (15) . For PEDV, the amino acid sequence of the ERRS is KVHVQ, which is highly conserved among different genotypes. One study demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution in this motif (KVHVQ to KVRVQ) weakens the intracellular retention function of the S proteins of the 10th passage of a murine-adapted PEDV variant, MK-P10 (18) , resulting in enhanced syncytium formation in Vero cells. However, this impaired KVRVQ motif does not alter the incorporation of S into the MK-P10 virions (6) .",

Most S proteins of alphacoronaviruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and gammacoronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), contain this motif in their CTs (Fig. 1A) . A previous study demonstrated that the Yxx\u233d motif is responsible for intracellular retention but not endocytosis of TGEV S proteins into cells (13) . Interestingly, this retention signal could be transformed into a strong endocytosis signal when the first lysine residue of the TGEV KxHxx motif was replaced by methionine (YEPIEKVHVH to YEPIEMVHVH; change is in bold type and Yxx\u233d and KxHxx motifs are underlined) (26) . For IBV, the role of the Yxx\u233d motif in S protein intracellular transport is controversial. One group reported that this motif is not an endocytosis signal (11) . The other group demonstrated that the Yxx\u233d motif functioned as an endocytosis signal in a chimeric protein composed of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein ectodomain and the CT of the IBV S protein (14) . It has also been demonstrated that a recombinant IBV harboring a mutated Yxx\u233d (YTTF to YTTA) in the CT of the S protein could not be recovered in cell culture, suggesting the essential role of this motif in the IBV life cycle. Moreover, since the 3=end of the IBV S gene overlaps with the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of accessory gene 3, mutagenesis of the IBV ERRS (KKSV to AASV) impaired the synthesis of subgenomic RNA 3 (sgRNA 3), resulting in decreased expression of E proteins in the IBV-infected cells (12) .",

At the 120th (P120) and later passages, we identified a premature stop codon in the 3=end of the S gene (27) . This stop codon truncates the S protein by 9 amino acids (aa) (EVFEKVHVQ) . Interestingly, at least five PEDV variants (FL2013, SM-98, CHM2013, AVCT12, and KNU-141112) containing a premature terminated S gene have been reported (Table 1) (28) (29) (30) (31) . All these PEDV variants are either cell culture attenuated or clinically mild in pigs, except for AVCT12, whose pathogenicity is unknown. These variants share the same S truncation pattern as PC22A-P120: partially ablated Yxx\u233d and completely deleted KVHVQ. It is possible that the loss of KVHVQ may enhance the surface S protein level and increase its ability to induce syncytia in cell culture. However, the function of the incomplete Yxx\u233d motif in viral replication and pathogenicity is unknown. Notably, two types of Yxx\u233d motif exist in the CTs of S proteins among PEDV genotypes: classical strains (G1a) and some highly virulent Asian strains (G2a) contain a YEAF motif, whereas highly virulent North American strains (G2b), S insertion and deletion (indel) strains (G1b), and some G2a strains harbor a YEVF motif. We hypothesized that the Yxx\u233d motif of PEDV, regardless of its amino acid sequence, is an endocytosis signal and determines viral virulence in pigs. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypes of transiently expressed S mutants containing mutations or deletions in these two motifs in mammalian cells and the virulence of three representative recombinant PEDVs in gnotobiotic piglets.",

To determine the roles of the two motifs in the intracellular sorting of S proteins, we constructed 12 plasmids bearing a wild-type S gene (of PC22A) or an S gene with different mutations in the CTs ( Fig. 1B and C) . Also, the dispensable 197-aa region (residues 34 to 230) in domain 0 of each S protein was replaced by fluorescent protein mCherry (236 aa), as we demonstrated previously that this 197-aa region does not interfere with the formation of S protein trimers (32) . WT1 and WT2 contain the YEVF and YEAF motifs, respectively. Using these two wild-type constructs as templates, we generated additional 10 mCherry-tagged S mutants, including mutants bearing point mutations and the CT-truncated variants ( Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ). The \u039410aa mutant lacks both motifs. The \u03949aa and HD mutants contain the CTs of PEDV strains PC22A-P120 and KNU-141112, respectively. The \u03947aa mutant bears the same CT as four S-truncated PEDV variants, FL2013, SM-98, AVCT12, and CHM2013. MK-P10 contains the identical CT to that of the PEDV strain MK-P10. To evaluate the difference in functions between YEVF and YEAF, three pairs of mutants (YA and YA-A, \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A, and MK-P10 and MK-P10-V) were generated.",

No statistically significant difference (P \u03fe 0.05) was observed among samples, indicating that all the recombinant S proteins were expressed at similar levels. Next, we measured the levels of S proteins on the cell surface using digital quantitative method and syncytium induction assay. The transfected cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde without permeabilization, and the surface S proteins were stained with green fluorescence (Fig. 3A) . Total (both surface and intracellular) S proteins were observed for the red fluorescence. Since each S protein produces equal intensity of red fluorescent signal, we quantified the levels of surface S proteins by measuring the ratios of gray values of the green fluorescent signal to mCherry signal and designated it the surface/total ratio. Fifty individual cells in each sample were measured and are plotted in Fig. 3C . WT1 did not differ statistically from WT2. Eight mutants (\u039410aa, YA, YA-A, \u03949aa, \u03947aa, HD, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V) expressed higher levels of S proteins than the two wild-type S proteins on the cell surface, while \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A expressed significantly lower levels (P \u03fd 0.05). Because proteolytic cleavage of surface S proteins triggers cell-cell fusion, a syncytium induction assay was performed by culturing the transfected cells in medium containing trypsin. The syncytia induced by the eight mutants (\u039410aa, YA, YA-A, \u03949aa, \u03947aa, HD, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V) contained significantly more nuclei than those induced by the two wild types (WT1 and WT2), while almost no syncytia were induced by the \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A mutants ( Fig. 3D and E). Collectively, these data suggest that an intact KVHVQ motif (WT1, WT2, YA, and YA-A) retains S proteins in the ERGIC, and the two motifs synergistically regulate the level of PEDV S protein expressed on the cell surface via different mechanisms.",

To determine whether the Yxx\u233d motif functions as an endocytosis signal in PEDV S protein, we performed an antibody-antigen (GP17-S protein) uptake assay. We evaluated the portions of the GP17-bound surface S proteins (green) being endocytosed after incubation at 37\u00b0C. As controls, one set of cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C, whereby the cell endocytosis activities ceased. Therefore, both the GP17-bound S proteins (green) and the surface S proteins (red), which were labeled after incubation and fixation without permeabilization, were colocalized on the cell surface ( Fig. 4) . On the other hand, for the cells being incubated at 37\u00b0C, a large portion of the GP17-bound S proteins (green) of WT1, WT2, MK-P10, MK-P10-V, \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A formed puncta in the cells and were not colocalized with the surface S proteins (red). This was further confirmed when we compared the PCC values between the GP17-bound S protein signal and total surface S protein signal of each S protein at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C (Fig. 5A ). We found that the PCC values of the six S proteins (WT1, WT2, MK-P10, MK-P10-V, \u03945aa, and \u03945aa-A) at 37\u00b0C were significantly lower than those at 4\u00b0C, suggesting that partial GP17-bound S proteins of those six samples were internalized from the cell surface after incubation at 37\u00b0C. Additionally, we probed the total GP17 signals on the cell surface without permeabilization in the GP17-S uptake assay (Fig. 5B ). We measured the ratios of surface S (GP17) signal to total S (mCherry) signal in the transfected cells incubated at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. WT1, WT2, and the MK-P10, MK-P10-V, \u03945aa, and \u03945aa-A mutants had significantly lower ratios at 37\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. In contrast, the other six mutants (\u039410aa, YA, YA-A, \u03949aa, \u03947aa, and HD) had similar PCC values (Fig. 5A ) and surface/total ratios (Fig. 5B ) at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C.

Antibody-S protein uptake assays were performed at 24 hpt for the two wild-type S proteins (WT1 and WT2) and the four mutants, \u03945aa, \u03945aa-A, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V, that formed puncta as shown in Fig. 4 . Cells were incubated with guinea pig anti-S1 antiserum GP17 at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. After washing with PBS three times, one set of cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to allow endocytosis and another set of cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. After fixation with methanol, early endosome marker Rab5 proteins were stained with rabbit anti-Rab5 MAb (C8B1) followed by AF647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (red). GP17-bound S proteins were stained with goat anti-guinea pig AF488-conjugated secondary antibodies (green 7A ). The villous atrophy in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was quantified by measuring villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD) ratios of each piglet (Fig. 7D to F). A lower VH/CD value indicates more severe atrophy in the intestines. Compared with the virulent icPC22A group, the lesions of ic\u039410aa-infected pigs were the least severe in all three small intestinal regions (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). Although there were no statistically significant differences in duodenum and ileum, the lesions in the jejunum of icYA-infected piglets were significantly milder than those of the icPC22A-and ic\u03945aa-infected pigs. We did not observe significant differences in clinical signs, fecal viral shedding titers, or VH/CD ratios between the ic\u03945aa and icPC22A groups. We concluded that the virulence of ic\u039410aa was milder than that of icPC22A, and the ic\u03945aa maintained virulence similar to that of icPC22A. These data suggest that deletion of both the Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ motifs from the S protein significantly impaired the pathogenicity of the highly virulent PEDV icPC22A. The Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ motifs are dispensable for PEDV replication, but the lack of either impairs viral replication efficiency in vitro. We measured the one-step (with a multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 5) growth kinetics of the viruses in Vero cells (Fig. 8A) . The three PEDV mutants had significantly lower peak titers than icPC22A at 12 hpi. Subcellular structures of the four recombinant PEDV-infected Vero cells at 12 hpi were visualized by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) of cellular sections. Like other CoVs, replication of PEDV induces dramatic membrane rearrangements (9, 36). We did not observe differences in the rearranged membrane structures among cells infected with the four recombinant PEDVs. However, in the icPC22A-infected cells, Golgi vacuoles contained more mature virions, which are smaller particles with denser cores than immature virions (9), than those in the ic\u039410aa-and icYA-infected cells (Fig. 8F and G) . The ic\u03945aa-infected cells contained intermediate amounts of mature virions in the vacuoles. trans-Golgi vacuoles containing large numbers of mature virions were observed exclusively in icPC22A-infected cells. This single-membrane structure contains viral particles prior to their egress. Collectively, these data suggest that neither the Yxx\u233d nor KVHVQ motif is essential for PEDV replication, but the absence of either motif impairs the generation of infectious PEDV viral particles.",

We measured multistep growth kinetics (MOI \u03ed 0.001) of the four recombinant PEDV in Vero cells (Fig. 8B) . We found that the speed of viral replication varied among the four recombinant viruses and the infectious titers gradually decreased after the majority of cells were lysed due to the formation of syncytia. In the growth curve, the peak titers of ic\u039410aa and icYA occurred earlier but were lower than those of icPC22A and ic\u03945aa. Replication of ic\u03945aa in Vero cells showed a peak titer similar to that of icPC22A, but with a delay. We performed plaque assays and measured the kinetics of the plaque formation of the four viruses ( Fig. 8C and D) . At 40 hpi, the ic\u039410aa virus had induced the largest plaques, followed by the icYA and then by the parental icPC22A, whereas the ic\u03945aa had formed the smallest plaques. We stained the surface S proteins of infected cells at an early time point (8 hpi) (Fig. 8E) . The fluorescent signals represented S proteins anchoring either on cell membrane or on the egressing virions on the surface. The S proteins of icPC22A-infected cells clustered mainly in a small area on the cell surface, presumably virions clustering at the egress sites, in contrast to the evenly distributed surface S proteins of ic\u039410aa and icYA on the entire cytoplasmic membrane, presumably S proteins anchoring directly on the cell membrane. The surface S proteins of ic\u03945aainfected cells were distributed in a pattern similar to that of icPC22A but showed less intense staining. These data suggest that the Yxx\u233d motif decreases the amount of S proteins on the cell surface in PEDV-infected cells.",

We observed virions with or without S protein projections on virions in all four samples (Fig. 9A) . The virions without S projections could be those that lack enough S proteins on the surface or whose S projections were lost during sample preparation for TEM. The ic\u039410aa PEDV contained the lowest percentage of virions with S protein projections, followed by icYA and then by icPC22A and ic\u03945aa.

            "text": "Journal of Virology particles in vitro. The Yxx\u233d motif and the KVHVQ motif function as an endocytosis signal and an ER retrieval signal, respectively. Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ together regulate surface S protein levels and S proteininduced syncytium formation. The number of nuclei in a PEDV S protein-induced syncytium, or the size of a syncytium, correlates with the amount of S proteins on the cell surface (6) . Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that both motifs are involved in the regulation of PEDV S proteins on the cell surface: the KVHVQ motif retains the S proteins in the ERGIC, limiting its transport to the cell surface, whereas the Yxx\u233d motif decreases the amount of surface S proteins via endocytosis. The mutants \u039410aa, \u03949aa, \u03947aa, and HD, which lack the complete KVHVQ motif and complete/partial Yxx\u233d motif, had the highest level of surface S proteins ( Fig. 3A and C) , probably due to the lack of both ER retrieval and endocytosis. The mutants YA, YA-A, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V had the second highest level of cell surface S proteins. For the YA and YA-A, this is probably due to the inactivation of the endocytosis signal, while their ERRS remained intact. For MK-P10 and MK-P10-V, it may be due to the impaired ERRS (KVRVQ; R is the mutation that leads to the impaired ERRS) while their Yxx\u233d motif was intact. Surprisingly, the mutants \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A had significantly lower levels of surface S proteins than WT1 and WT2. The lack of the entire KVHVQ motif resulted in significantly lower levels of ERGIC colocalization of \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A than of WT1 and WT2 (Fig. 2) , confirming that the KVHVQ motif functions as an ERRS in PEDV as described previously (6, 16) . Why, then, did we not observe an increased level of surface S proteins for these two mutants? We hypothesized that the loss of the entire KVHVQ motif in the CT of the S protein altered the intracellular sorting of S proteins. One possibility could be that the potency of their Yxx\u233d motifs, as the endocytosis signal, was dramatically enhanced due to the lack of the entire ERRS motif. A similar endocytosis enhancement effect was reported for the Yxx\u233d motif of TGEV when its KxHxx motif's conformation was changed due to the K-to-M mutation (26) . Another possibility could be that the deletion of the entire KVHVQ motif may cause other deficiencies in S protein sorting, such as impaired export from the ER or altered transportation to other organelles. Detailed mechanistic studies regarding the sorting of \u03945aa and \u03945aa-A S proteins are necessary to answer this question.",

The conserved location of the Yxx\u233d and KxHxx/KKxx motifs in the CT implies that the S protein sorting mechanisms may be similar among different CoVs (Fig. 1A) . However, previous studies on the Yxx\u233d motif of TGEV and IBV S proteins did not provide consistent conclusions (11, 13, 14, 26) . One reason could be that the expression efficiencies of vectors varied in those studies. Due to the small amount of S proteins expressed on the cell surface, the endocytosed S proteins might be too subtle to be detected in the antibody-antigen uptake assay. In our study, the plasmid pUC19-sgRNA overexpressed PEDV S proteins in Vero cells compared to some commercially available vectors (data not shown), probably due to the inclusion of the 5=leader sequence of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and PEDV 3=untranslated region (UTR) that enhanced the translation. Although we determined that both YEVF and YEAF are endocytosis signals of PEDV S proteins, it is possible that their efficiencies may vary. In the future, more advanced quantitative approaches, such as mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI) (19) , could be used to determine their affinities for binding to cellular factors. Additionally, one limitation of this study is that we did not applied approaches to monitor the kinetic trafficking of the endocytosis of S proteins from the cell surface. Future studies to address these points are necessary.",

Also, the total S protein levels (mCherry signals) of those mutants did not decrease during up to 2 days' culture. We hypothesize that the internalized PEDV S proteins are transported back to the virion assembly sites rather than being degraded in the lysosome. For PEDV, this endocytosis may be a strategy to efficiently use the expressed S proteins for the generation of infectious viral particles. This hypothesis may be supported by the quantitative data on S proteins incorporated into virions (Fig. 9) , because the ic\u03945aa PEDV with an intact Yxx\u233d motif had a number of S projections similar to that of icPC22A. This endocytosis signal Yxx\u233d motif may also help PEDV evade host immune responses by constantly decreasing the amounts of viral S proteins on the cell surface. Previous studies reported that inactivation of the Yxx\u233d motif in the envelope proteins of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attenuated the corresponding virus and enhanced the T cell responses in vivo (37, 38) . Moreover, host antibodies that have already bound to cell surface S proteins would be endocytosed into the cytoplasm, to evade antibody-dependent cell lysis (39, 40) . Another possible function of this Yxx\u233d motif in PEDV S protein is that it could downregulate the levels of viral receptors on the cell surface, which may be involved in superinfection exclusion.",

TEM images showed that ic\u03945aa-infected Vero cells contained significantly higher numbers of mature virions in the Golgi vacuoles than those infected with ic\u039410aa ( Fig. 8F and G) . Particularly, ic\u039410aa had a significantly lower percentage of purified virions with S projections on the surface and lower numbers of S projections on individual virions with surface S projections than the other three viruses (Fig. 9) . Therefore, ic\u039410aa may generate the highest level of defective virions (without enough S protein projections on the viral surface) among the four PEDVs, causing attenuation in vivo. The difference in S incorporation into viral particles among the PEDV mutants may be due to three reasons. First, the lack of both sorting signals renders more ic\u039410aa S proteins to be transported onto the cell surface, decreasing its level in the virus assembly site, ERGIC. Second, the intense and rapid cell-cell fusion induced by surface S proteins in the infected cells causes significant intracellular membrane rearrangements (41) , which may interfere with the ic\u039410aa budding and egress process. In contrast, ic\u03945aa does not cause significant syncytium formation. The third reason may be the altered interaction between S and M proteins in the virion assembly site. Although some previous studies revealed that mutation of the ERRS (KLHYT) of SARS-CoV S protein altered the S-M interaction and S incorporation into virions (15, 16) , another study suggested that inactivation of this motif in the S of IBV did not affect the S-M interaction (12) . For PEDV, a previous study of MK-P10 also showed that the impaired KVRVQ motif did not alter the S incorporation (6) , which is similar to our observation for ic\u03945aa (Fig. 9 ). In our S and M coexpression assay, we found that the four S proteins colocalized with the M proteins in the cytoplasm at the same level, and the coexpression of M protein significantly decreased the transportation of the four S proteins onto the cell surface, implying that those four S mutants may still interact properly with M proteins, although more experiments to evaluate S-M physical interactions are needed. Our current data support the first and second possibilities.",

It was reported that a recombinant IBV bearing mutations in its dilysine motif (KKxx) expressed less E protein, due to the decrease of sgRNA 3 synthesis (12) . In this study, the sgRNA 3 levels in the ic\u039410aa-and icYA-infected cells were about 3 log 10 and 2 log 10 lower than that in the icPC22A-infected cells, as determined by sgRNA 3-specific TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) (data not shown). sgRNA 3 expresses the accessory protein ORF3. We do not know whether the E gene in the sgRNA 3 can be translated during PEDV infection. Therefore, it is highly possible that the ORF3 protein level was decreased in the ic\u039410aa-and icYA-infected cells. However, due to the lack of effective antibodies against PEDV ORF3 and E proteins, we could not confirm these results at the protein level. The decrease of ORF3 expression may also contribute to the significant attenuation of ic\u039410aa and the slight attenuation of icYA in piglets because we determined previously that a PEDV lacking an intact ORF3 gene is partially attenuated in piglets (43) .",

In our study, the deletion of both the Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ motifs from the S protein could not completely attenuate a highly virulent PEDV strain in piglets, as ic\u039410aa still caused moderate diarrhea in all the piglets (n \u03ed 4). Therefore, the ablation of the two motifs was probably not the only determinant of the reduced virulence for those attenuated/mild PEDV variants (FL2013, SM-98, CHM2013, PC22A-P120, and KNU-141112). The attenuation of these strains must be the combined consequence of all the mutations in their genomes. We investigated why some Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants (PC22A-P120, SM-98, and KNU-141112) lost function of the Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ motifs during continuous passaging. We found that the corresponding mCherry-tagged S proteins (\u03949aa, \u03947aa, and HD) caused larger syncytia than the wild-type S proteins. The loss of the two motifs may facilitate the rapid spread of those PEDV variants between cells through enhanced syncytium formation. This idea was supported by a study of the mutant AVCT12. Jengarn et al. (29) demonstrated that recombinant AVCT12 was rescued in Vero cells only if the infectious cDNA clone contained the \u03947aa mutation in the S CT. We conclude that inactivation of both the Yxx\u233d and KVHVQ motifs of the S protein could be applied in the rational design of a PEDV vaccine since it results in more S proteins being transported onto cell surface in the infected enterocytes, facilitating antigenic recognition by the host immune system, and may not decrease protective immunogenicity because no neutralizing epitope has been identified in the S CT of PEDV. We aim to test this hypothesis in future studies. To achieve complete attenuation and to increase the safety of an attenuated vaccine, the inactivation of the two motifs should be combined with mutations in other key genes in the PEDV genome.",

Samples were embedded in agarose, dehydrated, and re-embedded in EM Bed812 resin (Electron Microscopy Science, Hartfield, PA). Ultrathin sections of each sample were prepared and stained. To visualize S protein projections on the virions, Vero cells were inoculated with the recombinant PEDVs (MOI \u03ed 2) in the presence of trypsin. Without freezing and thawing, virions in 500-ml culture supernatants of each recombinant PEDV were purified by using PEG-8000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) precipitation, followed by 30% sucrose-cushion ultracentrifugation (10,000 \u03eb g for 2 h), according to a previous protocol (51) . To maintain consistency, the four PEDVs were cultured and prepared simultaneously. Samples of subcellular section and purified virions were stained with 2% uranyl acetate prior to TEM imaging.
