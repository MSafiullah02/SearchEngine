The World Health Organization has published a range of interim guidelines for all countries on how to prepare for the pandemic, emphasizing the need for intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.2 Governments and hospitals have needed to redirect resources in an attempt to expand ICU capacity and meet the growing demand.; Current epidemiologic modeling is based on recent viral outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle-East respiratory syndrome, and influenza but cannot be regarded as robust until more data are gathered about COVID-19 itself.3 It has, however, become clear that policymakers must prepare for a health care crisis that may last up to 1, possibly 2 years. The current epicenters are in Europe and North America, and the epidemiologic curve was predicted to peak in most affected countries between April and May, with possible further epidemic waves thereafter.4\n",

About 10% of the reported cases in China and Italy have been among health care workers.5 In our hospital, a cohort of 538 asymptomatic staff members participated in a UK study that aims to ascertain the prevalence of asymptomatic viral carriage in health care workers. As we passed through the initial surge of COVID-19 cases, nearly one quarter of them were found to be antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing, and only 3% were positive to testing by polymerase chain reaction. Just more than one third of this cohort had previously self-isolated at home with symptoms of COVID-19 (unpublished data).",

Neurosurgeons have faced unprecedented challenges, including working outside their area of expertise, prioritization of neurosurgical cases with limited resources, facing new ethical dilemmas, and being exposed to moral injuries, medicolegal risks and, in some cases, to financial uncertainties. Neurosurgical training and research also have been reduced, and non\u2212COVID-related global health work has been suspended (Table 1\n). New working models and systems have needed to be developed, within a short period of time, to ensure safe neurosurgical practices as far as possible.6 Neurosurgeons have needed to rise to these challenges and take collective actions, in their local settings, to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic.",

For example, we have seen a reduced volume of neurotrauma from road traffic collisions and interpersonal violence. Consequently, the neurosurgical workforce has been engaged in task shifting and task sharing.7 These radical changes have required rapid retraining of neurosurgical staff, not just to manage the initial COVID-19 surge but also to support a maintenance phase for the duration of the pandemic.",

In our hospital, focused training and collaboration with other specialties has nevertheless helped us to build resilient teams able to provide appropriate care to patients. Areas in which transferrable skills can be applied are being explored, for example, application of theater-based lifting and patient transfer skills, in providing a \u201cproning\u201d service for ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have elected to redeploy trainees initially, leaving senior staff to assume a significant component of providing the care of neurosurgical patients. Although not required to date, we have the option of senior trainees filling gaps in neurosurgical duty rotations and retired neurosurgeons may be asked to return to work. Medical students have taken up some junior, ward-based roles. Above all, we have found that flexibility in our approach is crucial.",

Local mechanisms have been in place to ensure fair and ethical decision-making. In most settings, especially in the developed world, neurosurgical patients have not been competing with other patients for resources.

In terms of obtaining the best benefit from finite resources, priority may need to shift from treating the sickest to treating those most likely to respond to aggressive intervention. Parameters that were irrelevant or inappropriate previously may now direct our decisions to treat. Factors may include the availability of drugs, equipment, theater time, and ICU capacity but also life expectancy after surgery and age of the patient. The threshold to intervene neurosurgically will likely increase. Those particularly disadvantaged by these factors are elderly, vulnerable, and frail people. A particular consideration for this group of patients, in the context of neurosurgical pathology, is their concomitant greater risk of mortality from COVID-19 if they are being treated in a COVID-positive hospital. There is clear pressure for neurosurgeons to avoid bringing these patients into hospital, and standard treatments may therefore need to be replaced by suboptimal treatment methods. The risks of complications and unfavorable outcomes will inevitably increase.",

Withholding or delaying these and other neurosurgical procedures may result in significant neurologic impairment, or even death, in patients who would otherwise likely have faced a more favorable outcome. In particular, benign pathologies that cause raised intracranial pressure, or lesions that compress the brainstem, the optic apparatus, the spinal cord or the cauda equina, all have a time-critical component to their treatment. Such neurosurgical patients should not be unjustifiably disadvantaged over patients with COVID-19. The most common urgent neurosurgical conditions that require ICU admission are intracranial hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, with mortality rate of between 30% and 45%.9, 10, 11 For patients with COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality rate is also regrettably high, at 28% overall, but it is much greater, at more than 50%, among those requiring mechanical ventilation.12 In contrast, the prognosis for patients admitted to ICU following elective neurosurgical procedures is much more favorable.13\n",

Neurosurgeons must seek to avoid needless morbidity and mortality, which could arise as unintended consequences of the response to COVID-19. Algorithms and contingency plans based on epidemiologically predicted surge levels must allow for the adequate care of neurosurgical patients, as well as facilitating the dynamic resource allocation required to meet the overall needs of the outbreak.22 As a minimum, access to operating theaters should be maintained for time-critical neurosurgical cases.",

Governments worldwide will and already are being judged on their responses to this pandemic. Their prioritizing the management of COVID-19 is understandable, but this approach inevitably limits the access to health care by other patient groups, leading to \u201ccollateral damage\u201d and potential inequalities in health care. Neurosurgeons must therefore establish strategies that recognize and mitigate potential health care injustices against their patients. They should monitor their therapeutic activity in the light of any new demands placed upon their services. They should continue to audit their own practices and outcomes, identifying and highlighting any shortcomings arising out of the current crisis. They should participate in higher-level, managerial decision-making, acting as advocates for their patients. They should ensure that any new knowledge gained is appropriately used in developing future solutions to public health issues such as COVID-19. Neurosurgeons also could engage usefully with patient peer-support groups and charities, to enhance awareness of their particular needs. It has been reported that many patients are currently unable to obtain, or are frightened of, accessing health care because of the pandemic.24 Neurosurgical patients should not be left feeling neglected but, instead, be reassured that provisions are in place to address their needs.",

Strategies that are transparent and clearly justified will help to ensure ethical decision-making and will help health care workers cope with moral dilemmas. Local protocols that promote shared responsibility, especially in making difficult decisions, such as withdrawing or withholding treatment, should be developed. Fields within neurosurgery, in which restriction of services may appear controversial, include trauma, oncology, vascular, and spinal pathologies. Subspecialty professional groups need to provide disease-specific guidance as to how neurosurgeons should act when extreme pressure limits normal services. Hospital ethics committees should develop mechanisms to support clinicians in ethically challenging situations. Such provisions will lessen the impact of moral injuries and promote psychological resilience. To date, staff in our unit appears to be coping well with these ethical challenges, supported by daily briefings from hospital management and the provision of pastoral support when needed.
