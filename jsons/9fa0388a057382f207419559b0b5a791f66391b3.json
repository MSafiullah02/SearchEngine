These criteria were based on symptoms, including fever 37.8 C (100.0 F), dry cough, dyspnea, myalgias, or headache, and known COVID-19 exposures and/or recent travel. Specific to the COVID-19 outbreak, fever was defined by IPC as a temperature of at least 37.8 C (100.0 F). If the patient required admission and had no alternative explanation for these symptoms, COVID-19 testing using a SARS-CoV-2 quantitative PCR nasopharyngeal swab was done in addition to a PCR respiratory pathogen panel. If the patient did not require admission but had COVID-19 symptomatology, testing was done after review and approval by the IPC department. Women were discharged home with outpatient follow-up if they had stable vital signs, did not have oxygen requirement, denied significant shortness of breath or respiratory symptoms, and were deemed suitable for telehealth follow-up. After several healthcare workers were exposed with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) using this initial approach, 5 we initiated universal COVID-19 testing for all patients admitted to the labor unit as of March 22, 2020, in addition to symptomatic triage presentations, regardless of whether they exhibited viral symptoms or other at-risk history.",

Three of these women were admitted to the obstetric inpatient antepartum service, whereas the fourth woman was admitted to the medicine service 6 days postpartum. None of the antepartum women required oxygen supplementation upon admission. In consultation with infectious disease specialists, the first pregnant patient received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 day, followed by 400 mg daily for 4 days) along with ceftriaxone (1 g intravenously every 24 hours for 2 days) as treatment for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia. This patient had continuous fever before admission, with an admission temperature of 38.4 C. The second pregnant patient received supportive therapy with intravenous hydration only. This patient had a coinfection with parainfluenza virus and appeared unwell upon presentation but rapidly improved with intravenous hydration. The third pregnant patient received ceftriaxone (1 g intravenously every 24 hours for 2 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally daily for 3 days), and intravenous hydration. Despite these women having similar objective findings, they received different treatments after consultation with the infectious disease specialists, likely owing to nuances in their clinical characteristics and evolving recommendations. The fourth patient required readmission 6 days postpartum and 7 days after COVID-19 test confirmation. This woman re-presented to care because of worsening COVID-19 symptoms and a new oxygen requirement. Upon presentation, her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air but was noted to drop down to the high 80s% with movement. In addition, she was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30e32 breaths/min. She was initially placed on a nonrebreather face mask and eventually weaned to oxygen support via nasal cannula. The chest x-ray examination confirmed a bilateral multifocal pneumonia. She was admitted to the medicine stepdown unit after assessment by an intensive care unit (ICU) triage team. She was treated with oral hydroxychloroquine, with dosing as described previously.

However, these case series are small. 8, 9 Chen et al 9 described 9 cases of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy. None of these patients required ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. Liu et al 8 described 15 cases of pregnant patients who developed COVID-19. None of these women had preexisting comorbidities, and none required intensive care or intubation. Two of these women were asymptomatic at presentation and underwent testing owing to epidemiologic contact history. However, on computed tomography evaluation, lesions consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia were detected. In contrast to these series, 4 patients in this case series had severe disease and another 2 women developed critical presentations that required intensive care. Although the overall number is small, based on this limited case series, the course of COVID-19 during pregnancy appears roughly comparable with what was described outside of pregnancy. However, there are reasons why conclusions such as this may be false and misleading. Nonpregnant patients presenting to care during the COVID-19 outbreak generally present owing to worsening respiratory symptoms, whereas many pregnant women in this case series presented to care for ongoing obstetric reasons and before the onset of upper respiratory tract viral infection symptoms or fever. Our policy of universal testing for women admitted for delivery revealed an unexpected number of asymptomatic cases and suggested a milder course of disease in general. A universal testing strategy may therefore identify a milder subset of asymptomatic or presymptomatic women who are currently underrepresented in general population testing data, which is plagued by testing shortages and test rationing. As a result, there is likely an overrepresentation of sicker patients with COVID-19 in this broad test-positive cohort. Moreover, the only ICU admissions in this series were of asymptomatic women; hence our findings must be interpreted with caution until more data become available.",

The mortality rate was as high as 50% for these women who required ICU admission. In the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus outbreak, pregnant women were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk of complications compared with the general population. 12 Pregnant women may be more susceptible to respiratory pathogens and pneumonia compared with nonpregnant women owing to physiological adaptations to pregnancy, such as airway edema, diaphragmatic elevation, increased oxygen consumption, and pregnancy-related immunoalterations. 8 These adaptive changes also make women less tolerant to hypoxia. 8 Therefore, until more evidence is available, there is a reason to remain concerned for the clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnant women, despite encouraging early experiences here and elsewhere.",

Third, it provides useful information for the wellbaby and neonatal intensive care nurseries and reassures mothers before interacting with their newborns. Although there is no current proof of vertical transmission or transmission of the virus via maternal breast milk, viral shedding from asymptomatic or symptomatic women may also have implications in the management of neonates, with the possibility of neonatal infection from droplet transmission or nosocomial infection. 14 Our findings from a large proportion of asymptomatic positive patients also support more restrictive visitor policies, strict hand and respiratory hygiene precautions, and masking for all patients, birth partners, and the labor unit staff.",

An evaluation of COVID-19 detection rate with our current hospital testing strategy that includes universal testing for admitted patients is the focus of a planned follow-up study that is currently underway. Finally, we need more data to understand whether the virus is vertically transmitted.
