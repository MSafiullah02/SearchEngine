The number of confirmed cases at the time of writing this manuscript exceeded 77,000, and there were confirmed more than 2200 deaths, mainly in mainland China. On January 20, 2020, the National Health Commission of China confirmed the human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus outbreak.7 Ten days later, WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). COVID-19 symptoms include fever, malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress.1\n",

These enzymes are Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6), Protein kinase RNA-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK), and Inositol-requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1).14 Above a threshold of accumulated unfolded proteins, GRP78 releases ATF6, PERK, and IRE1, leading to their activation.

It has a slightly hydrophobic character, hence resembling the Pep42 cyclic peptide, and it seems suitable to be the binding site to the cell-surface GRP78. Fig. 3B shows the region III of the spike (black cartoon). As shown in the enlarged panel, region IV is part of region III and it is the most surface-exposed part of the spike receptor-binding domain.

A vast amount of host cell receptors are targets for viruses, including the cell-surface GRP78. Inhibiting the interaction that occurs between the COVID-19 spike protein and the host cell receptor GRP78 would probably decrease the rate of viral infection. Furthermore, a vaccine against the COVID-19 spike protein would likely prevent viral infection. The present in silico perspective suggests the existence of a COVID-19 spike protein-GRP78 binding site, thus paving the route for drug designers to develop suitable inhibitors to prevent the binding and hence the infection.
