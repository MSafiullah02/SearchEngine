            "text": "Gaucher disease (GD1) is the archetype lysosomal storage disorder resulting from the defective activity of acid \u03b2-glucosidase arising from biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene [1]. Its phenotypic presentation is diverse displaying imperfect correlations with mutations, mainly due to modifier genes [2], [3], [4]. Specifically, certain disease pathologies, such as malignancies [5], gammopathies [6], autoimmune diathesis [7], Parkinson disease [8], and osteoporosis [9] cannot be explained by the lysosomal accumulation of GBA1 lipid substrates in macrophages. Indeed, we have shown that mice lacking the GBA1 gene not only recapitulate the visceral manifestations of GD1, including hepatosplenomegaly, marrow infiltration, and extramedullary hematopoiesis, but also present with widespread dysfunction of unexpected immune cell populations [10]. Despite this new information, we know from clinical studies that most non-classical clinical features of GD are resistant to macrophage-directed enzyme replacement therapy, prompting an exploration into other potential molecules for treatment of GD.",

In contrast, the Connectivity Map (CMAP; http://broad.mit.edu/cmap) is a rapid in silico technique for studying connections between mechanisms of drug action, consequences of genetic perturbations, and molecular aberrations in disease states [11]. Superseding gene profiling, which was used to elucidate biological pathways and reveal cryptic disease subtypes, this new approach employs a disease (or drug) gene signature to query a database comprising gene expression profiles [11]. Non-parametric, rank-based pattern-matching using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov statistic reveals compounds that share mechanisms that overlap those of a given disease or genetic perturbation. These compounds can subsequently be tested for biological activity, potentially as lead molecules.",

After IPA pathway analysis, genes that constituted the most significant network, i.e. having the lowest p-value, were selected. However, not all selected genes were present in the original query as some were merely connecting molecules within the network. We therefore used more stringent filtering criteria for the IPA-analyzed genes, namely that (1) their expression pattern must follow a progressive change, and (2) the up- or down-regulated genes in the mild/moderate GD1 mouse must show a >2-fold change compared with control mice. Note that these criteria are more stringent in that the latter comparisons are being made between control and mildly/moderately affected mice (spleen size <6 multiples of normal), whereas in the initial screen control mice were being compared against severely affected animals (spleen size >6 multiples of normal).",

Interrogation of IPA with these gene sets yielded several most significant networks (Supplementary Table 5). The liver up-regulated genes comprised inflammatory response and immune genes, whereas lipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism genes were down-regulated. In contrast, gene pathways up-regulated in the spleen included infectious disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome genes, whereas those down-regulated comprised genes related to hematological system development, and the function and quantity of lymphocytes.

Notably, we found that the thymus exhibits the earliest and most striking alterations suggesting impaired T-cell maturation, aberrant B-cell recruitment, and enhanced antigen presentation [10], [13]. In contrast, the spleen showed less impressive changes in immune cell composition; these changes were restricted mainly to severely sick mice. Thus, we argue that genetic aberrations in immune gene expression revealed on high density microarray might precede, and perhaps even underlie, the cellular composition changes we note in the spleen. This is a prelude to future studies on human GD1 to evaluate whether query signatures could perhaps even be assigned to predict immune-related manifestations.",

The chemical structures of these hits are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Of note is that the data is ranked first by enrichment and then by percent non-null hits. This criteria is different from that used previously, wherein connectivity scores were the sole determinants of the CMAP ranking [19]. In line with inflammatory and immune gene regulation, CMAP yielded a host of chemicals utilized in acute and chronic infections. One such high scoring hit, albendazole (enrichment 0.823, p 0.0112, n\n = 3), is used as an anti-helminthic agent in cysticercosis. Interestingly, the highest ranking anti-mimic was oxamniquine, again an anti-helminthic agent against schistosomiasis.",

            "text": "Notable is that the response of the macrophage to the accumulation of major (GL1) and minor (Lyso GL1) lipid substrates arising from GBA1 deficiency has an interesting parallel with infection by chitin-containing parasitic organisms. For example, in addition to a trend towards alternative macrophage polarization [15] and Th2 responses [13], there is an impressive production of chitinases and chitinase-like proteins in GD1 [16], [17]. In fact, there is a massive up-regulation of chitotriosidase in lipid-laden Gaucher cells with a \u223c1000-fold elevation in serum levels in human GD1 [16]. Likewise, we have reported a \u223c25-fold increase in the expression of chitinase 3-like 1 and chitinase 3-like 3 in the liver and the spleen in GD1 mice [10]. This prompts the future testing of anti-helminthic agents, such as albendazole and oxamniquine, in GD1. A similar example of drug-disease pairing using an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) gene signature has led to the identification of topiramate, an anti-convulsant, as an effective agent for IBD [18]. Likewise, it has been shown using CMAP that certain HDAC inhibitors have mechanistic overlaps with selective estrogen receptor modulators [19].",
