            "text": "DENV is a plus-strand RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. Upon entry into the host cell, the released viral genome is translated at the rough ER, generating a single polyprotein that is processed by host and viral proteases into ten proteins. While the structural proteins Capsid, prM, and Envelope assemble together with the RNA genome into new virus particles, the nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 are responsible for the replication of the viral genome. This replication takes place within virus-induced organelle-like cytoplasmic structures called replication factories (Acosta et al., 2014, Chatel-Chaix and Bartenschlager, 2014). These ER-derived membranous compartments consist of three substructures: (1) vesicle packets (VPs), formed by invagination of the ER membrane and believed to be the site of RNA replication; (2) virus \u201cbags\u201d in which virions accumulate most often in regular arrays; (3) convoluted membranes (CMs) that form by an unknown process (Welsch et al., 2009). Owing to the enrichment of NS3 in CMs, they are considered to play a role in polyprotein maturation (Welsch et al., 2009, Westaway et al., 1997). However, DENV RNA translation occurs at the rough ER where (co-translational) polyprotein cleavage occurs, arguing that CMs most likely play additional role(s). While there is evidence that NS4A is able to induce CMs to some extent (Miller et al., 2007), other DENV proteins, such as NS3 or NS4B, might contribute to this process. In addition to this ER remodeling activity, DENV proteins were also shown to interfere with specialized cellular processes in order to create an environment favorable to viral RNA replication. This includes a role of NS4A in autophagy (McLean et al., 2011) and modulation of RNAi, as well as innate immunity signaling by NS4B (Dalrymple et al., 2015, Kakumani et al., 2013, Mu\u00f1oz-Jordan et al., 2003, Mu\u00f1oz-Jord\u00e1n et al., 2005). However, no functional link between these co-opting activities and the viral replication factories has been established so far.",

To gain more insight into NS4B function(s) during DENV infection, we determined the NS4B-specific host interactome in infected cells and identified several mitochondrial components. We show that DENV infection perturbs mitochondrial morphodynamics by inducing mitochondria elongation at the vicinity of NS3- and NS4B-containing CMs. Elongation is induced by NS4B and mediated by inactivation of the mitochondrial fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein-1 (DRP1). Importantly, mitochondria elongation favors DENV replication and dampens activation of the interferon response.",

NS4B-HA\u2217-associated proteins were efficiently co-purified from infected Huh7 hepatoma cells (Figures S1B and S1C) and identified using mass spectrometry (Figure S1D; Table S1). Based on three independent preparations, 19 host proteins were significantly enriched with NS4B-HA\u2217 and very strikingly, 12 of these hits were mitochondrial proteins. Among those, ATP synthase \u03b2 subunit (ATP5B), monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), and voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) were validated as NS4B interaction partners (Figure S1E), arguing for an association between NS4B and mitochondria.",

The same elongation phenotype was observed with another DENV2 strain, New Guinea C (NGC), with DENV of other serotypes (1, 3, and 4) and with two strains of the closely related Zika virus (ZIKV; H/PF/2013 and MR766, belonging to the Asian and the African lineage, respectively) (Figures S2B\u2013S2G and S2J).

In living uninfected cells, the mitochondrial network was highly dynamic, and mitochondrial morphology alternated between moderate elongation and fragmentation (Figure S3C; Movie S2). In stark contrast, in DVs-infected cells, mitochondria elongation became first visible 23 hr after infection and was most pronounced between 35 and 50 hr post infection (Figure 1D; Movie S2). At very late time points after infection, the mitochondrial network collapsed concomitantly with cell death due to DENV-induced-cytopathic effects. Mitochondria elongation was also observed in DENV2 NGC-infected cells (Movie S3), but with a faster kinetic correlating with a higher replication capacity of this strain.

Elongated mitochondria often localized in the vicinity of electron dense structures resembling convoluted membranes. Indeed, examination of ultrathin sections of infected cells at a higher resolution by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that CM-proximal mitochondria were more elongated than CM-distal ones (Figure 2B\u2013E). In contrast to uninfected cells in which mitochondria were found in contact with ER tubules called mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) (Vance, 2014), this interface was mostly disrupted in DENV-infected cells. Very strikingly, CMs appeared to be physically connected to mitochondria only at single sites arguing for a profound loss of the mitochondria\u2013ER interface (Figure 2B; Figure S4B, red arrows).",

DENV replicated efficiently in this cell line and induced mitochondria elongation (Figures S3D and S3E).

First, we used TEM of immunolabeled thawed cryosections of DVs-infected cells and confirmed that CMs contained both NS3 (as previously reported by Welsch et al., 2009) and a fraction of NS4B (Figures 3\nA\u20133C). Second, we applied correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) of DENV-infected cells using the Huh7/mito-mTurquoise2/YFP-Sec61\u03b2 cell line previously described. Importantly, by using YFP-Sec61\u03b2 as an indirect marker of NS3/NS4B-containing puncta to perform CLEM with nonpermeabilized cells, the YFP-Sec61\u03b2 fluorescent signal perfectly correlated with CMs detected by TEM, but not with VPs (Figures 3D\u20133F; Figures S5C\u2013S5E).

These processes are controlled by fusion factors (e.g., optic atrophy 1 [OPA1] and the mitofusins MFN2 and MFN1), as well as by fission factors (e.g., DRP1 and mitochondrial fission factor [MFF]) (Smirnova et al., 2001, Smirnova et al., 1998, Otera et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2003, Olichon et al., 2003). While mitochondria-resident proteins MFN and OPA1 localize on the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively, and promote interorganelle membrane fusion, DRP1 is primarily cytosolic and translocated to mitochondria to mediate fragmentation via its dynamin-related activity (Chan, 2012). This fusion/fission equilibrium can be influenced by modulating the expression of these factors. Indeed, RNAi-mediated knockdown of DRP1 stimulated mitochondria elongation, whereas decreased MFN2 expression favored their fragmentation (Figures 5A and 5B) without affecting cell viability during a 5-day observation period (Figure 5C). Importantly, DRP1 knockdown-mediated elongation stimulated replication of both DENV strains DVs and NGC (Figures 5D\u20135F), whereas MFN2 knockdown-enforced mitochondria fragmentation inhibited DENV replication. Interestingly, the replication of ZIKV, which also induced mitochondria elongation, was stimulated by DRP1 knockdown as well (Figures 5G and S6C), whereas replication of WNV and HCV remained unaffected under these conditions (Figures 5H and S6C). These results show that mitochondria elongation favors DENV and ZIKV replication.",

Enforced mitochondria elongation by silencing DRP1 expression increased the number and volume of NS4B-containing clusters whereas in cells with MFN2 knockdown no NS4B-positive clusters (and hence, CMs) could be detected.

While phosphorylation of Ser637 remained unaffected during infection, the level of DRP1 phosphorylated at serine residue 616 decreased in DENV-infected cells for both endogenous and overexpressed DRP1 (Figures 6B\u20136C and S7E). Ser616 of DRP1 was previously reported to be phosphorylated by several kinases, namely CDK1, CDK5, and ERK1/2 (Lee and Yoon, 2014, Chan, 2012). Strikingly, CDK1 expression decreased in DENV-infected cells (Figure 6D) while the levels of activated ERK1/2 and CDK5 remained unchanged during DENV infection (Figure S7E). Importantly, this phenotype was mediated by properly membrane-associated NS4B since the expression of either the NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor or 2K-NS4B alone was sufficient to decrease both P-Ser616-DRP1 and CDK1 levels, which was not the case with NS4B lacking the 2K signal sequence (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that DENV inhibits phospho-S616-dependent activation of DRP1 and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria, thus perturbing the fusion/fission equilibrium.

In the light of the altered ER-mitochondria contact sites, indicative of MAMs, we reasoned that the virus might induce mitochondrial changes in DENV-infected cells to suppress the activation of the innate antiviral response. Hence, we evaluated the impact of mitochondria morphology on DENV-induced interferon (IFN) induction. When elongation was favored by knockdown of DRP1 expression in Huh7 cells, the induction of endogenous IFN-\u03bb1 expression markedly decreased, best visible with the DENV2 NGC strain (Figure 7\nA), consistent with the increase of virus titer (Figures 5E and 5F). In contrast, knockdown of MFN2 expression induced mitochondria fragmentation and enhanced the expression of IFN-\u03bb1 (Figure 7A), which correlated with the impaired DENV replication (Figures 5E and 5F). The analogous result was obtained when monitoring IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03b2 and ISG56 expression in A549 cells (Figure 7B), which are more competent especially with respect to IFN-\u03b2 production. Interestingly, knockout of RIG-I in Huh7 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 technology suppressed DENV-induced IFN-\u03bb1 production \u223c100-fold (Figures 7D and 7E), showing that RIG-I-dependent signaling is responsible for most of DENV-induced innate immune response.",

Upon knockdown of DRP1 expression, the abundance of RIG-1 in the MAM fraction was drastically decreased, concomitant with an accumulation in the cytosolic fraction (Figure 7F) and consistent with a reduced innate immune signaling (Figure 7A).

Here, we show that DENV\u2014via NS4B\u2014induces mitochondria elongation as a result of fragmentation inhibition. This was due to suppressed phosphorylation-dependent activation of DRP1 and impaired translocation to mitochondria, which, however, is required to trigger fission via the dynamin-related activity residing in DRP1. The sole expression of 2K-NS4B is sufficient to downregulate CDK1, a kinase contributing to DRP1 phosphorylation at Ser616; this is consistent with the observed induction of mitochondria elongation by this viral protein. Since CDK1 (in complex with cyclin B) is primarily active during mitosis, NS4B might inhibit DRP1 phosphorylation predominantly during this phase of the cell cycle. In this case, the alteration of mitochondria morphology during interphase as observed here would be triggered during mitosis and last for extended periods thereafter.",

            "text": "Several reports showed that DRP1 translocation to mitochondria depends on prior actin-dependent constriction of mitochondria by juxtaposed ER tubules or, more precisely, MAMs (Friedman et al., 2011, Korobova et al., 2013, Manor et al., 2015). Considering that ER-mitochondria contacts are partly disrupted in DENV-infected cells, we hypothesize that CMs also contribute to the disappearance of pre-constricting ER and hence, to the loss of DRP1 translocation and mitochondria fission. Hence, the observed mitochondria elongation most probably results from a combination of NS4B-dependent inactivation of DRP1 and MAM disruption that appears to be linked to CM biogenesis. However, we cannot exclude that the fusion machinery might be modulated by DENV as well, e.g., by altering MFN proteins (Pyakurel et al., 2015, Chen and Dorn, 2013, Glauser et al., 2011, Leboucher et al., 2012, Ziviani et al., 2010). Very recently, Yu and colleagues proposed that DENV infection inhibits fusion activity of mitofusin proteins (Yu et al., 2015). Although we never detected MFN1 or MFN2 cleavage in DENV-infected cells, we note that the conclusions of Yu and coworkers were based on rather artificial experimental approaches, including heterokaryon formation and MFN overexpression-based mitochondria hyperfusion assays, and the impact of DENV on mitochondria fusion was evaluated during short timescales and after high virus-dose inoculation. Moreover, these authors used stable knockdown cell lines to silence MFN gene expression, which we avoided to limit the risk of selecting for cells compensating the fragmentation phenotype by alternative mechanisms to maintain the fusion/fission equilibrium. Moreover, Yu and colleagues did not directly address the impact of DENV on DRP1 function and on general mitochondria morphodynamics (e.g., by using mitochondria staining of naive cells infected with DENV). We note that Yu and colleagues did not report mitochondria fragmentation in DENV-infected cells, which would be expected in case of fusion inhibition; this demonstrates that the proposed impairment of fusion makes little, if any, contribution to the overall mitochondria morphology in infected cells. Some of the discrepancies might also be explained by different timing of analyses. While the DENV-induced elongation phenotype reported here is most obvious 48\u201372 hr post infection when CMs form, Yu and coworkers observed MFN function as early as 24 hr post infection.",

We show that mitochondria elongate during DENV infection, and ER-mitochondria contact sites are disrupted most probably by CM formation. In this way, ER membranes tightly surrounding mitochondria appear to be removed, thus impairing the recruitment of activated RIG-I to MAMs and protecting the virus from an antiviral state. While this is an interesting mechanism by which a virus escapes innate antiviral defense, DENV utilizes additional strategies. For instance, the DENV NS2B-3 protease, is highly enriched in CMs, proteolytically inactivates the MAM-resident signaling adaptor STING (Aguirre et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2012) and prevents RIG-I translocation to mitochondria by targeting the adaptor protein 14-3-3\u03b5 (Chan and Gack, 2016). Moreover, NS4B overexpression was found to impair the RIG-I/MDA5-dependent pathway at the level of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 activation via an unknown process (Dalrymple et al., 2015). Given the central role of NS4B in mitochondria elongation as described here and its interaction with NS3 (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2015), the functional cross-talk between these two proteins for all these phenotypes will be an important task for future studies.",

            "text": "Despite conflicting reports about the role of mitofusins in IFN induction (Castanier et al., 2010, Onoguchi et al., 2010, Yasukawa et al., 2009, Yu et al., 2015), it was shown that mitochondria elongation increases ER-mitochondria contacts (as monitored by STING/MAVS interaction) and would hence, stimulate innate immune signaling (Castanier et al., 2010). Moreover, several studies support the idea that some viruses evade from innate immunity by inducing mitochondria fragmentation to disrupt MAVS-dependent signaling (Kim et al., 2014, Yoshizumi et al., 2014, Xia et al., 2014). In the present study, we rather observe that mitochondria elongation is proviral and alleviates type I and III IFN expression. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that DENV, by inducing CMs, disrupts MAMs and thus, an early IFN response. Reminiscent to DENV, Shi and colleagues reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF-9b protein induces mitochondria elongation through the proteasomal degradation of DRP1, and impairs innate immunity by targeting MAVS-dependent signaling (Shi et al., 2014). Of note, two independent studies by other groups showed that SARS-CoV also induces convoluted membranes (Knoops et al., 2008) and impairs STING-dependent signaling (Sun et al., 2012). In light of our results with DENV, one might speculate that SARS-CoV uses a similar \u201cmitochondria-elongation\u201d strategy to disrupt innate immunity. Although some molecular details about the link of mitochondria elongation and dampened IFN induction remain to be clarified, we propose that DENV NS4B induces mitochondria elongation to provide MAMs to NS4A, which stimulates CM biogenesis (Miller et al., 2007). Consequently, MAM-associated proteins, such as STING, would be hijacked and redirected to CMs. This accumulation of host factors in CMs may facilitate their cleavage by the NS2B-3 protease that is highly enriched in this compartment (Welsch et al., 2009). Whether such a DENV hijacking model could apply to additional MAM functions, such as autophagy, apoptosis, calcium transfer or ER-stress (van Vliet et al., 2014, Vance, 2014), remains to be determined.",

(A and B) 48 (Huh7) or 24 (A549) hr later, cells were collected and mRNA amounts of IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03b2, and ISG56 were quantified using qRT-PCR. Quantifications are representative of three independent replicates. (C) Knockdown efficiency in A549 cells was monitored 4 days post transduction by western blotting using MFN2- and DRP1-specific antibodies. Actin served as loading control. (D) Huh7 RIG-I knockout cell pools were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology using two different guide RNAs and lysates of cells were analyzed by western blotting. (E) RIG-I knockout cells were infected with DVs or left uninfected. Two days later, abundance of IFN- \u03bb1 and \u03b2-actin mRNA was measured using qRT-PCR. IFN- \u03bb1 induction levels upon infection were calculated after normalization to \u03b2-actin. For qRT-PCR experiments (A, B, E), error bars indicate SD calculated using three technical replicates. (F) Huh7 cells were transduced and infected with DVs as in (A). Cell extracts were subjected to subcellular fractionation to isolate MAMs. Equal amounts of proteins from each fraction were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies recognizing the indicated proteins. FACL4 and calnexin served as markers enriched in the MAM fraction and \u03b1-tubulin as cytosolic marker.",
