There are over 2000 different HLA alleles at present and the number is constantly increasing. However, antigen binding studies are limited to a small proportion of these alleles; the binding specificities of most alleles are unknown. Several research groups have attempted to partition different HLA alleles into groups. In this chapter previous classifications are reviewed and we present two chemometric approaches to classifying class I HLA alleles. The program GRID is used to calculate interaction energy between protein molecules and defined chemical probes. These interaction energy values are imported into another program GOLPE and used for principal component analysis (PCA) calculation, which groups HLA alleles into supertypes. Amino acids that are involved in the classification are displayed in the loading plots of the PCA model. Another method, hierarchical clustering based on comparative molecular similarity indices (CoMSIA) is also applied to classify HLA alleles and the results are compared with those of the PCA models.",

Human MHCs are also called human leukocyte antigen, often abbreviated to HLA [Clark & Forman 1984] . There are two classes of HLA, class I and class II. Class I HLA is present on most nucleated cells, including the surfaces of lymphocytes, which have 1000 to 10000 HLA molecules per cell [Goust 1993] . Class II HLA is mostly expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells. Partly as a result of their importance in mediating tissue rejection, sequencing has identified MHC proteins as amongst the most polymorphic of all human gene products. According to the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT), there are over 2000 different HLA class I and II alleles and a significant number of new alleles are discovered every year [Robinson et aL 2003] . In Chapter 9, Borghans et aL explore the nature and origin of MHC diversity in more detail.",

This has led to the concept of MHC supertypes: the idea that MHCs with distinct sequences can be classified into separate groups, each of which displays equivalent, if not necessarily identical, specificities when binding peptides. The celerity of experimental research will be greatly accelerated if one could identify a procedure able to cluster HLA alleles with similar specificities. Several research groups have sought to classify HLA alleles in this way, using a wide variety of different methods. Examples of such disparate methodologies include sequence analysis [Lawlor & Warren 1991] , structural analysis [Chelvanayagam 1997 ], use of geometrical similarity matrix methods [Cano & Fan 1998 ], and motif search [Sette & Sidney 1998 , Lund et aL 2004 .",

Lawlor compared the sequences of 14 gorilla class I MHC alleles with HLA-A, B and C alleles in human and MHC in chimpanzees. Sequences of human, gorilla and chimpanzee MHC alleles are similar but not identical, as most of the polymorphic residues appear in the same region. Also genes at A, B and C locus of gorilla and chimpanzee MHCs are similar to HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C, respectively. Phylogenetic trees are generated for A, B and C genes and it is found that HLA-A alleles are divided into five families: A2, A3, A9, AlO and A19. Two divergent groups of HLA-C alleles are found, one containing Cw*0701 and Cw*0702, the other with Cw*0101-Cw*0601 and Cw*1201. HLA-B is the most polymorphic locus in the human HLA genes and no consensus group is found in the study. Based on Lawlor's research, Jakobsen et al. aligned DNA and protein sequences of the HLA-A alleles. The DNA alignment showed that family signatures are not focused on one region but are distributed throughout the sequence. The protein sequence alignment revealed that position 62, 97 and 114 in the binding site are important in the classification [Jakobsen & Gao 1998 ].",

In contrast to data driven models, which rely on the accumulation of significant quantities of binding data, an important approach seeks a structural understanding of peptide binding by analysing the structure of MHC receptor binding sites. These allow connections to be identified between diff'erent MHC alleles at the functional level. Any significant similiarity apparent between binding sites should also be mirrored in the overall peptide selectivities exhibited by different MHCs. Comparative investigation of such relationships should allow the prediction of similarities in peptide selectivity and the effective grouping of different alleles.",

Similarly, Gopalakrishnan and Roques simulated the interactions between a peptide and the H-2Kd binding site using the molecular dynamics program AMBER.

HLA molecules within one group have the same or similar amino acids in a particular binding pocket are expected to bind to the same peptide. The analysis was used to classify HLA molecules that have not been studied experimentally and thus to predict their binding motif. Although classified separately, groups of HLA-B and C molecules share the same binding specificity with HLA-A if they have the same amino acids in the binding site. The drawback to this form of classification is that since the classification is done according to the residues surrounding one position of the peptide, for a nonamer peptide, the HLA alleles are classified nine times and the same allele is often found in different groups in different classifications. A similar study has been carried out by Zhang et al., in which the binding pockets of class I MHC are classified into families by modelling the structures of MHC-peptide complexes using crystal structures as templates. Five families were defined according to specificities in the pocket B, and three families were defined based on specificities inside pocket D. Three more families were also defined for alleles with a joint specificity of pocket C and D [Zhang et al 1998].",

Sidney et al. defined four supertypes by examining reported cross-reactive epitopes [Sidney et al. 1996a] . They then compared the sequences corresponding to the MHC binding pockets B and F. Experimentally confirmed binding motifs of the alleles were also examined, and those with similar motifs are grouped into one supertype [Southwood et al. 1998 ]. The supertypes identified in the paper are listed in table 10.4. The same group later published review papers in which the four supertypes were revised. A*0207 was added to the A2 supertype and B*1508 and B*5602 were added to the B7 supertype [Sette & Sidney 1998 , Sette et al. 1989 . Recently A*2902 and A*3002 are added to the Al supertype [Sidney et al. 2005] . Sette and Sidney carried out further analysis in 1999 and defined a total of nine supertypes including the previously defined supertypes [Sette et al. 1989 ]. The nine supertypes were estimated to cover 99% of the world population ( Based on Sette's study, [Lund et al. 2004 ] classified HLA-A and B molecules using specificity matrices. The nonamer ligands of all HLA-A and B molecules were collected from SYFPEITHI and MHCPEP and were aligned. The frequencies of each amino acid at each position were summarised as a matrix, and this was used for a cluster analysis. The resulting HLA super families were organised into a consensus tree. In their results, the A26 alleles were separated from the Al cluster described by Sette, and a new B8 superfamily was defined. The other superfamilies were the It should be noted that class II HLA molecules have also been classified using a sequence approach. Chelvanayagam defined the HLA-DR roadmap by allele binding specificities and the polymorphic residues inside the binding site. The important residues were identified by studying the crystal structures of known HLA-DRpeptide complexes [Chelvanayagam 1997 ]. HLA-DP [Castelli k, Buhot 202] and DQ [Baas & Gao 1999] supertypes have also been defined based on a combination of binding studies to define motifs together with structural modelling of the peptide-MHC complexes. Reche and Reinherz used multiple sequence alignment to find important residues in 774 class I and 485 II HLA molecules. Consensus sequence patterns were obtained for the binding sites of HLA-A, B, C, DP, DR and DQ groups [Reche & Reinherz 2003 ].",

PC A decomposes a matrix X into two smaller matrices: the scores matrix T and the loading matrix P', which explain the overall variance of the X matrix. The scores matrix contains a few variables M, that is, the principal components (PC), which can be used to describe the observations. The loading matrix reveals the relationship between the variables in the original matrix and the principal components. Plots of the observations in the multidimensional space are called the scores plot, which identifies similarities and differences within the observations and groups them accordingly, while the loading plot relates the original variables to the PCs and identifies variables that are important in distinguishing groups of observations. When more than one probe is used in the GRID calculation, the data generated by different probes are grouped into blocks, and they are often analysed by hierarchical PC A methods such as consensus PC A (CPCA). The advantage of CPCA compared to PCA is that it compares the relative importance of each block in the calculation and makes a 'consensus' clustering of the objects. CPCA uses the same underlying principle as PCA: a CPCA model tries to explain the overall variance of the original data matrix. The algorithm used in CPCA is an adaptation of the NIPALS algorithm used in PCA [Wold & Hellberg 1987] . Like PCA, CPCA calculates the principal components and gives the scores and loading matrix. In addition, CPCA also calculates the importance of each data block. It calculates the scores and the loading matrix for each probe used, and also returns the weight matrix that can illustrate the contribution of each probe to the overall scores.",

The classification of the cluster B27 was debatable, as most of the molecules in the B27 cluster, as defined by hierarchical clustering, were in the B7 cluster in the CPCA model. The HLA-C classification gave the best agreement using the two methods (93% consensus). Only 8 molecules were classified into different subtypes by the two methods. Molecules that have been classified into different clusters by the two methods were considered as outliers as it was not possible to classify them properly into clusters. They require future re-classification using other, more sensitive techniques. A closer look at the protein sequence level showed that these outliers do not significantly resemble the classified alleles.

A*0204 differed from A*0201 by having one amino acid mutation Arg -> Met at position 97. Met97 is inside pocket F. The side chain of Met97 is smaller compared with Arg, therefore increasing the volume of pocket F.

Nonhierarchical clustering uses five z descriptors to describe hydrophobicity, steric bulk, polarity and electronic effects of the HLA molecules. K-means clustering is applied to the set and the initial number of k seeds is equal to the number of clusters obtained from the hierarchical clustering. The known crystal structures of class II HLA are used as templates in homology modelling. Like the class I HLA classification, the class II alleles are grouped into twelve families.

Only two positions are responsible for HLA-DQ classification, position 71 and 86 of the beta chain. All alleles with Val86 are grouped in DQl cluster, while those with Glu86/Lys71 are in DQ2 and those with Glu86 and Thr/Asp71 are in DQ3. The DP classification is mainly based on polymorphism at position 69 and 84 of the beta chain. Alleles with Asp84 are grouped into DPwl/2 and those with Gly/Val84 are in DPw4/6. Alleles in DPwl/2 are separated by amino acid differences at position 69, those with Lys69 are grouped into DPwl and those with Glu69 are in DPw2. DPw4 and DPw6 are separated by Lys69 and Glu69, respectively. The classification by hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering have a consensus of more than 85%.",

As the number of unique HLA sequences greatly exceeds the number of unique solved MHC crystal structures, protein structures used in these studies have been derived by homology modelling. Although HLA molecules are structurally similar, there may be some differences in the binding site conformation, and potentially this limitation is confounding. However, compared with HLA classifications based on peptide binding motifs, chemometric methods have some advantages (table 10.4). GRID/CPCA and hierarchical clustering are more fiexible as they only require the sequence information of molecules, therefore all the HLA molecules available, whether or not they have been studied experimentally, can be classified. In contrast, the motif-based method can only classify that small number of HLA molecules with sufficient binding data. Most of the motifs include only anchor residues of the peptide, therefore only part of the peptide binding site interaction is studied. GRID/CPCA method takes the whole binding site into consideration and identifies important positions involved in the classification. Also, motif based classifications use a haphazard mismash of differently derived experimental binding data, which may be biased and inconsistent. GRID/CPCA classification only uses sequence information, albeit manifest as homology modelled 3D structures, and thus minimises data inconsistency.",

Some have sought insights into MHC supertypes from a sequence perspective, others from the perspective of structural data. The classification we outlined here identifies crucial, cluster determining differences at several important positions in the binding site. These positions are the HLA 'fingerprints'. The HLA-A fingerprint includes position Phe/Tyr9, Arg97, Hisll4 for A2 supertype, Ser9 and Arg97 for A24 and Ser/Thr9, Ile/Arg97, Glull4 and Aspll6 for A3 supertype. The HLA-B fingerprint is Asn63 and Leu81 for B7, Glu63 and Leu81 for B27 and AlaSl for B44. The HLA-C fingerprint is Ser/Gly77 for CI and Asn77 for C4 supertype. The important positions for Class H DR supertype classification are position 9, 70 and 74, and position 71 and 86 are identified as the fingerprint for DQ clusters. These HLA fingerprints enable us to group any new HLA molecules into supertypes, accelerating HLA function characterisation and help to define the peptide binding motif for the molecule. Also, the HLA supertype classification allows immunologists to use similarities in sequence and structure to make educated guesses about peptide binding specificity that will help in identifying good MHC binders and testable potential epitopes.",

            "text": "The veracity and pace of vaccine identification would be enhanced greatly were one able to group HLA alleles into effective supertypes. An accurate and sufficiently extensive classification would render experimental work much more efficient, since one could look at a few supertypes rather than at thousands of separate alleles. This would thus greatly expedite the discovery of epitope based vaccines targeted at multiple alleles. Supertype definitions have already shown utility in epitope based vaccine discovery. Epitopes taken from hepatitis B virus infected patients have been shown to cross react with alleles in the A2, A3 and B7 superfamilies [Bertoni & Sidney 1997 ]. Epitopes isolated from Epstein-Barr virus reacted with several alleles of the B*44 family [Khanna & Burrows 1997] . Epitopes have been shown to crossreact with the A24 family [Burrows Sz Elkington 2003] . Many viral and tumour antigen derived vaccine candidates have also been shown to be able to bind multiple alleles. Sette et al. predicted 223 potential cancer peptides of CEA, Her-2/neu, P53 and MAGE antigens using a T cell epitope prediction algorithm, among which 115 were cross-reactive with peptides of the A2 supertype. 43 peptides were tested for immunogenecity and 73% were positive [Sette & Livingston 2001] . Recently a protein sequence scan has been carried out to search for T cell epitopes within the sequence of the SARS virus, based on the nine HLA supertypes in Sette's analysis [Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2004] . Fifteen predicted epitopes for each supertype were identified and tested experimentally: 75% of the predicted epitopes were found to be high affinity peptides (IC50 < 500nM) and about 112 candidate epitopes were obtained.",

            "text": "All supertypes are theoretically derived, even the experimental supertypes promulgated by Sette. His supertypes were derived from the comparison of binding motifs. Motifs are, at best, an inadequate description of peptide specificity. Possessing a certain verisimilitude, they can only give rise to a partial and largely incomplete definition of supertypes, limited by the lack of data for most MHC molecules. Structural supertypes represent an encouraging solution to this problem, unencumbered by lim-itations imposed by the availability of binding data. Modern methods in particular, such as the GRID/CPCA method we outline here, allow us to propose supertype definitions solely based on sequence and structural data. In one seamless movement we can preogress from HLA sequencing to structure to supertype classification to binding specificity to epitope prediction. The clinical potential of such a process are tantalizing. Moreover, the same fundamental methodology can be used to address the issue of identifying benign HLA mismatches in tissue rejection, such as kidney transplants, bone marrow donation, and the like. Such problems require a robust, reliable and, preferably, transparent measure of structural similarity between HLA molecules in order to suggest which pairs of alleles will present the same peptides or be equally invisible to antibody surveillance. The GRID/CPCA method offers the possibility of effectively addressing all these problems and many more. All that is required is the requisite investment of time and resource in order to realize this potential coupled, of course, to the willingness of experimentalists to exploit these techniques. , 1101, 3101, 3301, 6801 37, 4001,4002 4006, 41, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50 1401 -02, 1503, 09, 10, 18, 2701 -08, 3801, 02, 3901 --04, 4801, 02, 7301 07, 35, 51, 53, 54, 55, 56, 67, 78 1516, 17, 5701, 02, 58 1301 -02, 1501, 02, 06, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21, 4601, 52 1502, 08, 09, 10, 11, 15, 18, 21, 29, 37, 44, 51, 52, 55, 64, 72 1801 -18 Fig. 10 .7.

Alleles in the first and second clusters all have polar amino acid Asn at position 66, while alleles in the third cluster have basic amino acid Lys at this position. Alleles in the first cluster have acidic Glu63 but those in cluster 2 have Asn63.Two clusters are identified from the hierarchical clustering based on CoMSIA fields of pocket B (table 10.4). Cluster Bl has A. The classification is based on a single amino acid at position 70. Alleles with basic amino acid His70 are in cluster 1, while those with Gin70 are in cluster 2.The HLA-A alleles are separated into two clusters according to specificities in pocket C (table 10.10). The first cluster include mainly A*01, and A*8001 are in the second cluster. One main feature of pocket C is position 74, alleles within cluster CI all possess acidic amino acid Asp74, whereas alleles within cluster C2 have basic His74.There are four clusters defined for pocket D(table 10.11). Cluster Dl includes all A*01 except A*0106, A*0249, A*1108 and A*36.

Amino acids fingerprint for this classification is consisted of position 114 and 156. Alleles with basic amino acids such as Arg or His at position 114 are grouped into the first three cluster and alleles with Phe or Gin are in the last cluster. The first three clusters are further separated by polymorphism at position 156. Alleles with Arg, Gln/Trp and Leu are grouped into cluster 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Four clusters are identified for pocket E (table 10.12). The first cluster is composed of serotype A*01, A*03 (A*0302, A*0307, A*0310), A*1101-02, A*1104-07, A*1109-14, A*2612, A*2618, A*29, A*31, A*32, A*33, A*36, A*6801, A*6803-05, A*6808-ll, A*6813, A*6814, A*6816, A*6818-23, A*74 and A*8001.
