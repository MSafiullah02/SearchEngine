In order to select a substance that imitates perfectly the visual aspect of urine, the famous Brazilian guarana (Paullinia spp.) was tested. The guarana seeds are used mainly to produce a soft drink that present similar visual appearance of urine [19]. Hence the soft drink in its diet version was utilized to prepare samples to be tested on the urine diagnostic assays. These assays include the detection of glucose by the classic Benedict's copper reduction reaction and of acetoacetic acid (the physiological ketone) by the reaction with sodium nitroprusside in a strongly basic medium.",

On the first sample, glucose (5% w/v) and acetone (10% v/v) were added, representing the diabetic urine (Fig. 1). To the second sample, only acetone (10% v/v) was used to reproduce the urine from a starving person with prolonged diarrhea and vomiting (Fig. 1). The last 100 ml was considered the normal urine, therefore no glucose or acetone were added (Fig. 1). Usually the urine specimens should not remain unrefrigerated for longer than 2 h, but in the case of guarurine samples they resisted several weeks out of the fridge, probably due to the presence of preservative in its formula. This aspect permits the storage of guarurine samples for longer periods than urine.",

As these demanded changes occur, an alteration in the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of academic professor will be required, which includes the way teaching is delivered and learning is facilitated [21, 22]. Herein we described a laboratory class experiment that can be applied in any biochemistry course avoiding ethical and biosafety issues. Through the correct application of our established alternative tool and the understanding of the technical and clinical details of this practical session, the students could acquire knowledge not only about biochemistry but also about specific problems related to handling of the samples and reagents and how clinical results are obtained and interpreted. Other advantages of this practical class are that it is fast, reasonably safe, and have low cost, requiring fewer resources to simulate clinical cases. This economical advantage is important to a country that struggles to maintain its own public academic institutions such as Brazil.",
