Some emerging countries like Brazil, India, and China have invested extensively in researches for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases, especially malaria. In the 1970s, Chinese researchers presented artemisinin and its semisynthetic derivatives (Artemether, Arteether, Artesunate, Artemisinic acid, and Dihydroartemisin) as potential antimalarial drugs (Li et al. 1998; Prince 2000; Haynes 2001 ). The success of these drugs in the treatment of malaria is due to the fact that the Plasmodium strains have still little or no resistance to them.",

The main vector to humans and other mammals is mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles, which comprises more than 400 species, with only a few epidemiologically important. These mosquitoes have nocturnal habits, and only females feed on blood and are responsible for the transmission of the Plasmodium (Rabinovitch et al.1998; FioCruz 2017) . The life cycle of the protozoan is divided between a host and an insect vector, as briefly described below and illustrated schematically in Fig. 8 .2. (I) By stinging the host, the sporozoite form of Plasmodium, lodged in the mosquito's salivary glands, is injected into the bloodstream until it reaches the liver. (II) In hepatic cells, the sporozoites reproduce asexually generating other cells called merozoite (not all merozoites reproduce asexually, some develop sexually). (III) The merozoites destroy the erythrocytes, causing anemia in the host and initiating a series of reproductive cycles. (IV) Some merozoites will become immature gametocytes, precursors of male and female gametes. (V) By re-stinging the host, the The stages I-IV occur in the host cells and stages V and VI occur in the Anopheles mosquito gametocytes will be collected and matured in the mosquito's digestive system. (VI) The fusion of gametocytes will result in zygotes (also named as ookinetes) that will subsequently be converted into sporozoites, which migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito, thus initiating a new infectious cycle (Rabinovitch et al. 1998; Cunico et al. 2008; FioCruz 2017) .",

The mechanism of action of complex 1 was described as the posthydrolytic binding to hematin in solution inhibiting its aggregation to b-hematin. Results show that the presence of the metal resulted in significantly enhanced activity against CQ-resistant strains (Sanchez-Delgado et al. 1996; Mart\u00ednez et al. 2008; Salas et al. 2013) . Sanches-Delgado et al. (1996) synthesized the first class of ruthenium complexes containing CQ as ligand. In vitro experiments showed that arena ruthenium complexes were more effective than CQ against resistant strains of P. falciparum. Arene-Ru(II)-chloroquine (complexes 2-4, Fig. 8 .3) demonstrated appreciable antimalarial activity.

Studies on the elucidation of the possible mechanism of action of this complex include two targets, i.e., the inhibition of hemozoin (malarial pigment) and DNA interaction. Experiments with mice showed that treatment 1 mg/kg of AuCQ, and parallely with equivalent concentrations of CQDP, induced a reduction in parasite cells of 84 and 44%, respectively, when compared to the untreated control. These results suggest that the complexation of gold to CQ increased the in vivo susceptibility of P. berghei to CQ (Navarro et al. 1997 (Navarro et al. , 2011 and lead to the search for novel gold-CQ complexes, which were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated against CQ-sentitive and CQ-resistant strains of P. falciparum.

All complexes exhibit enhanced antimalarial activity against 3D7 P. falciparum strains. Furthermore, correlations between the antimalarial activity and the metal redox couple indicate the component of the parasitic electron transport chain as a possible target of such compounds (Gokhale et al. 2006) . Complexes containing buparvaquone of general formula [M(II)(L1) 2 (C2H 5 OH) 2 ], where M(II) = Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe and L1 = buparvaquone ({3-trans-(4-tert-butylcyclohexyl) methyl-2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone}), were studied (Gokhale et al. 2003) . The copper complex that showed better results demonstrated a thousand-fold enhancement in the antimalarial activity of parent quinone against 3D7 strain. Furthermore, this complex was three times more active against the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum K1 strain when compared to the free ligand. Experiments with this strain cellular showed a 90% Fig. 8.4 Chemical structure of some metal complexes with antimalarial activity reduction in parasitemia at a dose of 15 mg/kg, which demonstrates the high potential of the copper complex as antimalarial agent (Gokhale et al. 2003) .

These complexes exhibited better efficacy in comparison to their free ligands against D10, W2, and 3D7 strains of P. falciparum (Khanye et al. 2010; Quirante et al. 2011) . Besides the enhancement of the efficacy of organic drugs, the metal complexes correspond to new alternatives for the treatment of malaria, such as the inhibition of the parasite establishment in the vector mosquito.",

Although there are structural similarities between chloroquine and FQ, the in vitro activities against P. falciparum of these compounds are distinct. FQ has high efficiency against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum parasite strains, reaching efficiencies 20 times higher than chloroquine. FQ exhibited high activity in vivo against P. yoeli, P. vinckei, and P. berghei strains (Biot et al. 1999 . Some evidences point that the action of FQ seems to be related to inhibition of the hemozoin formation in the food vacuole of the parasite. Despite the similarity in mechanism when compared to CQ, studies indicated that FQ is more efficient than CQ to inhibit the formation of b-hematin. FQ and CQ showed IC50 values of 0.8 and 1.9, respectively (Biot et al. 2005) .",

In this context, metalloantimalarials based on antimalarial drugs, metal chelators, and organometallic complexes were evaluated. Among all these compounds, ferroquine is the most successful representative, already being tested in phase II clinical trials. Studies on the physiology of the parasite allowed the understanding of the mechanisms of action of new drugs and stimulated the design of new more efficient drugs. With these studies, in the near future, it is expected that metallodrugs with low toxicity and high efficiency will be found for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases such as malaria. In addition, the production costs and the final product are extremely important factors, since this guarantees the accessibility of the population of poor countries affected by these diseases.",
