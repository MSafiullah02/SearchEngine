Wuhan is a transportation hub in central China; thus, infection with SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly to other Chinese cities and many countries worldwide. On the 30th of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this coronavirus outbreak as an \"international public health emergency.\" As of the 24th of February 2020, there were 77,779 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with 2,666 deaths worldwide. The prospects for preventing an epidemic were grim.

In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, experts used these data for SARS and MERS as a reference and estimated the incubation period for COVID-19 to be 2-14 days (4, 5) . However, Zhong et al. reported a patient whose reverse-transcriptase polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) result became positive on the 24th day after known contact (6) . Furthermore, 9/80 patients' diagnoses were unconfirmed until their third nucleic acid test (7) . Thus, the optimal duration of isolation is still unknown. The typical chest computed tomography (CT) imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple patchy ground glass opacities in multiple lobules bilaterally with a peripheral distribution (8) . The imaging findings are normal in some patients with early stage infection, pulmonary abnormalities developing as the disease progresses (9) . However, the rate of imaging changes in the lungs and the risk of lesions in each lobe are unclear. Compared with the cases in Hubei province, affected patients outside Hubei, China, have exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. There are few published studies on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and chest imaging findings of patients infected with COVID-19, especially in areas outside Hubei province. We therefore performed this retrospective study to provide more data about COVID-19, including the timeline for clinical symptoms and virological conversion and chest radiological abnormalities. ",

A confirmed case was defined as a positive result for throat swab specimens on high-throughput sequencing or real-time RT-PCR assay. These findings were rechecked by the Zhuhai Center for Disease Control in Guangdong Province. By detailed review of the electronic medical records, we collected information, such as the patient's epidemiological history, time of last contact (time of last contact with a known infected individual or of leaving Hubei Province), date of onset of disease (day when symptoms first noticed), time of attending a clinic, admission time, laboratory test positive and negative conversion times, chest radiological abnormalities, and time to improvement. Follow-up lasted until the 24th of February 2020. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated all CT data.",

The median time between onset of symptoms and the first RT-PCR-positive throat swab was 4 days (0-15), RT-PCR-positivity occurring within 1 week of the onset of symptoms in most cases ( Figure 2B ). The median time from the last contact to the first RT-PCR positive throat swab was 8 days (0-18), 90.6% (77/85) of patients having positive RT-PCR tests within 14 days of leaving the epidemic area or confirmed patient(s), and 21.2% (18/85) of patients were completely asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms. Most of these 18 patients were diagnosed during observation as inpatients because they were close contacts. The longest interval from contact to RT-PCR-positivity was 18 days, which may mean that the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is longer than is currently believed. A longer isolation time is therefore required (Figure 2C ). The median time from admission to the first positive RT-PCR throat swab was 0 days (\u22122 to 12). Although one patient was first found to be RT-PCR-positive on the 12th day of admission, 89.4% (76/85) patients tested positive for RT-PCR within 1 day of admission (Figure 2D) , indicating that the scope of screening needs to be extended to maximize identification of asymptomatic carriers. Twice negative RT-PCR tests is one of the criteria for lifting of quarantine. At the time of final follow-up, 80 patients had met this criterion. The median times from last contact, onset, and admission to twice negative RT-PCR tests were 19 days (6-38), 15 days (5-36), and 11 days (3-26), respectively.

The typical imaging manifestations of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS, namely, ground glass opacities in the lung parenchyma in the early stages and areas of consolidation in the later stages, some of which are round, the lesions are mostly distributed on the periphery of the lung (15). On admission, 71.8% (61/85) patients had abnormal imaging findings. These patients were older than the other 28.2% (24/85) patients who had normal CT scans (P = 0.031). However, we detected no predilection for male vs. female patients, and found no differences in other clinical features between the two groups. Pathological changes can occur in both lungs, mainly in both lower lobes, and the risk of infection in the left lower lobe is 13.8 times higher than that in the right middle lobe. This conclusion is consistent with Salehi's research (16) , and we speculate that it may be due to the physiological structure of the right middle lobe. In addition, whether there is a difference in gene expression in the right middle lobe leads to different susceptibility, which requires further study of pathological data and in-depth study of the mechanism.",

By dynamically observing changes in CT findings, we found that lesions characteristically appeared first in the lower lung and developed upward, which may explain the late appearance of upper respiratory symptoms after exposure to the source of infection. Possibly because our study cohort is too small, our findings do not reflect the time differences in imaging lesions. It is also possible that some patients were in clusters, as having experienced close contact between an initially diagnosed patient being found to have pulmonary lesions on CT scans. The fact that pulmonary lesions do not appear soon after exposure does not mean indicate that SARS-COV-2 has a short incubation period. Within a week of onset, 50 of our patients had abnormal chest CT scans, whereas 61 had positive RT-PCT tests, suggesting that RT-PCR detects SARS-CoV-2 earlier than chest CT imaging.",
