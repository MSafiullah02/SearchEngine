In our patient, however, viral RNA was found in several body sites including nasal and nasopharyngeal secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial specimens, feces and urine, indicating direct association between HRV and the severe symptomatic infection, even though no viremia was detected.

Thus, our case also demonstrates that persistence of a strain, to exclude re-infection with another, must be confirmed with specific measures. In older children and in adults, HRV shedding lasts usually 1-2 weeks. 4, 21 Immunological immaturity of a neonate may have contributed to the lengthy shedding. Earlier, persistent HRV shedding has been recorded in immunocompromised lung transplant patients and in hypogammaglobulinemic patients. 22, 23 In conclusion, our observations support the view that specific laboratory diagnosis of HRV infections should be used in children with severe pneumonia. On the basis of VP4/2 sequence analysis, the fulminant and long lasting infection in our immunocompetent neonate was caused by a type of HRV C species.
