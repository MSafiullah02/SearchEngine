As of this writing (March 28, 2020) over one hundred thousand individuals in the United States of America were confirmed cases. One way of treating the associated disease, COVID-19, is to reuse existing FDAapproved medications. One medication that has shown promise is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).

We assessed whether there was an increased risk of any of these four outcomes following exposure to HCQ during pregnancy where exposure was determined to occur between 280 days (i.e., 40 weeks) and up to 1 day prior to the date of delivery. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania approved this study. We found that 28 deliveries had documented HCQ exposure, results shown in Figure. We did not find increased risk for any of the four measured outcomes (p>0.05): Caesarean Section, Preterm birth, Multiple birth, and Stillbirth. We also expanded our search to include all quine drugs (i.e., HCQ, primaquine, mefloquine, chloroquine phosphate) and found the same negative result (i.e., no increased risk).",
