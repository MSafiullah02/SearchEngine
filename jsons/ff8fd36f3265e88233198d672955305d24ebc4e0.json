At present, the origin, susceptible population, and infection sources already have been clear. 1,2 However, the transmission routes, a key step to the epidemic control, have not yet been fully ascertained. Here, we focus on the potential transmission routes that have been investigated in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic recently. SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS, is predominantly spread via respiratory tract with high infectivity. It is commonly recognized that droplet transmission is the main route. Spread by aerosol is suspected to be another important route of transmission but unestablished now. Epidemiological experts, as well as the WHO, consider more evidence is needed to confirm. 3 Besides, there are other routes except respiratory transmission. The previous study indicated that different human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can maintain infectious for a different time on inanimate surfaces. 4",

In summary, fecal-oral or fecal-droplet mode of transmission may be one of the several routes and cannot be ignored.",

Here, we focus on the potential transmission routes that have been investigated in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic recently. SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS, is predominantly spread via respiratory tract with high infectivity. It is commonly recognized that droplet transmission is the main route. Spread by aerosol is suspected to be another important route of transmission but unestablished now. Epidemiological experts, as well as the WHO, consider more evidence is needed to confirm. 3 Besides, there are other routes except respiratory transmission. The previous study indicated that different human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can maintain infectious for a different time on inanimate surfaces. 4",
