            "text": "The first human infections with the new influenza A (H1N1) virus were confirmed in April 2009 in America, but the infection had been rapidly spreading around the world and in June 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic [1-5]. WHO had advised countries in the northern hemisphere to prepare for a second wave of pandemic spread [6]. To date, almost all countries in the world have confirmed a second wave of H1N1 virus [7,8]. For this reason a working group of WHO member states agreed on a pandemic influenza preparedness framework [9]. The reason for creating this framework began with the need for real time virological data exchange among laboratories in different countries upon a pandemic outbreak [10,11]. The H1N1 virus has resulted from a triple recombination containing genes from human, avian, and swine influenza virus [12,13]. The incidence, clinical characteristics and factors affecting the patients outcome of the first wave have been well described in previous published studies [14-17]. However, while the numbers of positive H1N1 patients were lower, the hospitalisation rates were higher in comparison to the numbers and rates of 2009. In addition, the proportion of hospitalised cases admitted to intensive care units (ICU) was higher in 2010. The reason for these differences are not yet completely clear. There has been no obvious change in the severity of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 disease thresholds for hospital and ICU admission [8]. Three possible explanations were given. First, a new pandemic influenza A (H1N1) genetic variant predominated in the winter 2010 influenza season [7]. The Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 strain had undergone mutation in the hemagglutin. This mutation was associated with severe clinical outcome in comparison to the usual influenza A (H1N1) 2009 strain [7,18,19]. Secondly, resistance to oseltamivir developing from the first wave reached a peak in the 2010 pandemic [20,21]. Thirdly, it has been reported that this year's seasonal vaccine effectiveness was moderate, suggesting an insufficient protective effect against the second wave of influenza A (H1N1) [22-27].",

The incubation period for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus is understood to be approximately four days (range: 1-7 days). The period of communicability is estimated to be seven days in uncomplicated cases; however, it may be longer in children (up to 10 days) and other individuals in whom symptoms and virus shedding may persist (i.e. immuno-compromised and severely ill). Consistent with seasonal influenza, transmission of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus is most likely during the initial days of infection when cases are typically symptomatic and have higher viral loads [31].",

So far, there has been no evaluation of H1N1 respiratory function. The correlation between the mechanisms and the impact that viruses have on the respiratory system has been established in previous published studies [14-17,28,29,39-44]. As might be anticipated, we found a major decreased respiratory capacity (FEV1 -10.205, FVC -9.909, DLCO -12.409) between the measurements taken upon discharge and in the six-month follow-up. This occurred due to the inflammatory effects of the virus through the respiratory tract. The differentiation of respiratory capacity also varied between the measurements taken upon discharge and the three-month follow-up, but it was observed that the variation was smaller in comparison to the sixth-month visit, which is possibly due to the time needed for the resolution of the inflammatory effects.",

            "text": "The mechanisms of H1N1-induced respiratory effects have received considerable attention [39-44]. Recent studies have shown that the high mortality rate of avian influenza virus infections is a consequence of an overactive inflammatory response and the severity of infection is closely related with virus-induced cytokine dysregulation. The most important feature of influenza A immune-pathogenesis is the appearance of \"cytokine storm\", which is characterized by the extreme production and secretion of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines. This is responsible for the development of lethal clinical symptoms, such as massive pulmonary edema, acute bronchopneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, reactive hemophagocytosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, associated with necrosis and tissue destruction. Numerous in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies have pointed out that A/H5N1 viruses are very strong inducers of various cytokines and chemokines (Tumor Necrosis Factor [TNF]-alpha, Interferon [IFN]-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, Interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1, MIP [Macrophage Inflammatory Protein] -1, MIG [Monokine Induced by IFN-gamma], IP [Interferon-gamma-Inducible Protein]-10, MCP [Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein]-1, RANTES [Regulated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted], IL-8), in both humans and animals. The major cells implicated in the cytokine storm are macrophages and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, while the primary contributor cytokines are TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. It has been detected that mutations of some viral genes (NS1, PB2, HA and NA) are responsible for the \"cytokine storm\", by increasing the viral replication rate, expending the tissue tropism, as well as facilitating the systemic invasion and the development of resistance against the host antiviral response. Glu92 and Ala149 mutations and carboxyl-terminal ESEV/EPEV motif of NS1 protein have been implicated as determinants of virulence for A/H5N1 strains. In addition, Lys627 mutation in PB2 protein, polybasic aminoacid mutations in the cleavage region of hemagglutinin (HA) polyprotein, and glycosylation and sialyzation mutations in HA and neuraminidase (NA) proteins were found to enhance the immune-mediated pathology of highly virulent A strains [40-45]. Furthermore, in a preliminary analysis of macrophage gene expression data based on published studies, 64 genes in H1N1-infected cells showed at least 1.5-fold difference in expression level compared to mock infected cells in at least one time point [43]. Impressively, as many as 60 genes were thereby upregulated [43].",

Several antiviral agents were tested both in vitro and/or in vivo and presented results implicating that the early use of such agents suppress the inflammation apart from being a therapy [43-49] Antibiotics especially macrolides, which are well known for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties were also tested. Clarithromycin inhibits the middle to late stage of the influenza virus replication cycle, resulting in inhibition of progeny virus production from the infected cells. Macrolides could mediate this effect by inhibiting intracellular hemagglutinin HA0 proteolysis. The inhibitory effect on influenza virus replication of macrolides has been known since the 80s [50-54]. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a thiol-containing compound which non-enzymatically interacts and detoxifies reactive electrophiles and free radicals. NAC has already been shown to effectively protect human bronchial fibroblasts against the toxic effects of tobacco smoke condensates and the isolated perfused lung against the glutathione (GSH)-depleting effect of tobacco smoke. NAC has also been demonstrated to reduce the reactive oxygen intermediate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to confer protection from the toxic effects of H2O2. In vivo studies, however, have demonstrated that orally administered NAC has very low bioavailability due to its rapid metabolism mainly to GSH but also other metabolites. Thus, even though NAC is very effective in protecting cells of different origins from the toxicity of reactive components in tobacco smoke and reactive oxygen species, a direct scavenging effect by NAC in vivo, does not seem likely. This holds especially true for oral administration. A more relevant mechanism in vivo for any protective effect of NAC may be attributable to its activity as a precursor of GSH, thereby facilitating its biosynthesis. GSH will then serve as the protective agent and detoxify reactive species both enzymatically and non-enzymatically [55,56]. Finally, the efficacy of vaccination for H1N1 has been documented by assessing antibody formation in the vaccinated elderly subjects from the 2009 pandemic in contrast to the younger ones who were not vaccinated. Nonetheless, antibodies from older subjects previous encounter with pandemic influenza A strains may be a confounding factor [57].",

First, our patient series was small, but it should be borne in mind that since these H1N1 positive patients represent a population of 350.000 residents. Furthermore, diagnostic tests with procalcitonine, urine antigen and blood cultures were given only upon suspicion of an infection. The respiratory capacity tests represented a small number of patients in each group, and so no correlations could be preformed between the four subgroups. In addition, the baseline condition of each patient was not evaluated; this was either because they did not have a respiratory underlying condition or because they were patients that admitted in our hospital for the first time.",

Several treatment modalities can be administered to confer protection and suppress the inflammation. Vaccination and early treatment with antiviral agents represent the mainstay of management.",
