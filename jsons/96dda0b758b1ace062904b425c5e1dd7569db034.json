He was wearing an N95 mask. He developed difficulty in breathing and was dizzy. On the way home, he was unsteady and fell. When he arrived home, he found that his mouth was crooked and although concerned, did not go to the hospital because of his fear of the virus. He went to bed and woke up in the morning with a left-sided hemiparesis. He was sent to a nearby hospital where a magnetic resonance brain scan showed acute cerebral infarction and large blood vessel occlusion. However, this hospital like many others across China understandably did not have adequate relevant experts and resources to perform thrombectomy or arrange proper admission because of the fear of COVID-19 and the shortage of physicians resulting from them being sent to areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases. In-hospital acquisition of COVID-19 is a huge problem based on recent reports. 2,3 His condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to another hospital seeking advanced treatment 2 days later. There are similar stories that patients who have acute stroke have no idea whether to attend hospital and where to go for treatment.",
