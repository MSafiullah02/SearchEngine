In China, hospitals offer two-dimensional barcodes, a so-called QR code (Fig. 1a), for patients to check their lab results and imaging findings simultaneously with medical staff by smartphones, or after it has been viewed by a physician. For those who need to attend to hospital, there are a number of measures to detect possible signals of COVID-19, especially on oncology wards. Wearing masks is required for everyone, whether symptoms exist or not; we are not questioning evidence for this, but psychologically, it serves as a warning to \u201cbe careful\u201d. Temperature monitoring is one of the prerequisites in the entrance of every hospital and on every ward and this includes staff. Everyone entering our hospital is mandated to have an Alibaba \u201chealth code\u201d that is connected to a large database, providing automatically generated classifications of suspected patients with different \u201csecurity levels\u201d defined by colour category (Fig. 1b). Only one room in an oncology ward can accommodate a single patient, and visitors for patients were not allowed at any time to enter wards during the \u201cCOVID-19 period\u201d. Chinese hospitals have \u201cfever clinics\u201d to effectively screen suspicious COVID-19 patients, and this occurred rapidly for those with cancer with results within 2 h with both PCR and immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM testing). Thus, if a cancer patient with fever attends hospital, they must initially consult an infectious disease specialist; only if COVID-19 is then ruled out, can subsequent diagnostic procedures then be initiated. The hospital I (LP) work at is the designated provincial hospital in Zhejiang Province to admit COVID-19 patients, and the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang Province have on the whole been milder compared with those in Wuhan.3 In our department, the number of cancer patients receiving radiotherapy in February 2020 decreased to 35% compared with February 2019; similar figures apply to chemotherapy. We believe overall, however, that both capacity and efficiency of Chinese hospitals have offered cancer patients great support during the COVID-19 era.",

According to national regulations, medical isolation was required for 14 days after his negative coronavirus test, but the stage of the tumour mandated some urgency. In this case, we first screened him, including the nucleic acid test of swabs and a chest CT scan to rule out the possibility of COVID-19 infection. Then we opened a special room for him with sterilisation procedures and administered induction chemotherapy on the same day. After the chemotherapy was complete, he went to a close-by hotel for self-isolation. At the end of the isolation period of 14 days, he was ready to receive a second cycle of induction chemotherapy.",

TCM has been used routinely and in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients,5 such as the botanical extract sophorcarpidine, which was approved as a cancer treatment by the NMPA (National Medical Products Administration), and has preliminary efficacy reported in 40 COVID-19 patients.6",
