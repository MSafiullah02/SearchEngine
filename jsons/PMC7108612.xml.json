UC is a disease of the epithelium\u2014a very superficial process. Colonic crypt epithelial cells undergo necrosis, granulocytes aggregate in crypts and adjacent lamina propria, and the inflammatory process extends, undermining additional crypt units, causing ulcers. Attempts at healing result in a hyperplastic response, misshaped or branched crypts, and ultimately dysplasia. There are autoimmune elements to this disease, autoantibodies against colonic epithelium and lymphocytes occurring in a variable proportion of patients, and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in 60%\u201380%.1\n",

Childhood appendicitis is very often viral, whereas adult\u2010onset appendicitis is most often bacterial in origin. Hypothetically, exposure to a \u201ccolitis virus\u201d during the late teen years, adolescence, or early adult years might be expected to result in 1 of 3 outcomes: little or no clinically manifest disease, acute appendicitis, or, if later, UC.",

Persons exposed to the hepatitis B virus may experience little or no clinical disease, some have acute disease and recover, and others suffer the consequences of persistent viral infection, with or without superimposed autoimmune elements. Just as the virus of non\u2010A, non\u2010B hepatitis eluded medical research for so many years, a viral etiology for UC may be eluding us currently. The disease lacks the appearance of a bacterial process and does not respond to treatment with antibiotics.",

The earliest lesions in these diseases occur in the lymphoid follicles of Peyer's patches. These \u201ctonsils\u201d of the lower gut are concentrated in an incomplete circumferential ring at the distal end of the ileum, and distributed at \u201cskip\u201d intervals in more proximal intestine.6 Bacteria and viruses are taken up regularly by the M cells in the epithelium overlying the lymphoid follicles, for the sampling of antigens that occur in the intestinal lumen. Many organisms use Peyer's patches as portals of entry, including even the prions of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Thus, the place of onset and the distribution of lesions suggest that CD is microbial in origin. Loop\u2010to\u2010loop adhesions, localized peritonitis, abscesses, granulomas, and fistulas are all evidence of bacterial invasion.",

There is also the absence of a spontaneously occurring animal model. Spontaneous regional enteritis of pigs is bacterial in origin and has many features of CD,7 but few investigators recognize the comparative aspects of the disease or study its origins and pathogenesis.",

Given the age group affected most frequently, it may be important to recognize the possibility that CD could be the result of 2 pathogens, a persistent or recurring virus, which initiates disease (with a short episode of gastroenteritis) and then flares in activity from time to time, and an E. coli of the granuloma\u2010inducing kind. Such 2\u2010pathogen sequences are well recognized in pneumonias of all species, albeit these being acute, and in chronic respiratory disease of fowl, in which a respiratory coronavirus or paramyxovirus is accompanied and abetted by E. coli.13 Antibiotics help patients with CD and there may be resolution of some clinical manifestations, but antibiotics do not cure the condition. A persistent viral agent such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), or one that commonly recurs, such as influenza or the enteroviruses, may ultimately be shown to initiate CD. That multiple cases occur within families and even in spouses suggests exposure to a shared environmental agent.14\n",
