The components of weather include minimum temperature ( 0 C), maximum temperature ( 0 C), temperature average ( 0 C), humidity (%), and amount of rainfall (mm). Spearman-rank correlation test was used for data analysis. Among the components of the weather, only temperature average ( 0 C) was significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic (r= .392; p<.01). The finding serves as an input to reduce the incidence rate of covid-19 in Indonesia.",

Climate variables can also be a direct cause of biological interactions between SARS-CoV and humans. Optimal temperature, humidity, and wind speed are variables that can determine the survival and transmission of the SARS virus (Yuan et al., 2006) . Changes in weather are very significantly correlated with changes in mortality rates due to pneumonia (Bull, 1980) . Viruses can be transmitted by being influenced by several factors, including climatic conditions (such as temperature and humidity), and population density (Dalziel et al., 2018) .
