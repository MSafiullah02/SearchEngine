On the 30 th of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COIVD-19 a public health emergency of international concern and 6-weeks later the outbreak was characterized as a pandemic. As of the March 25, 2020, the WHO reports 414,179 cases of COVID-19 globally causing 18,440 deaths [1] . The WHO's global risk assessment for the situation remains \"very high\". The rapid spread of the disease, the increasing number of cases and associated mortality as well as the lack of therapeutic and vaccine options, prompted many governments and health authorities to implement strict measures to combat the pandemic. These include community lockdown, travel and movement restrictions, and cancelation of events and non-essential gatherings [2] . Data suggests that countries which implemented decisive and early interventions may have helped in reducing the spread of the disease and flattening their epidemic curves [3, 4] . Countries with previous experience of coronavirus outbreaks, notably Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), such as Singapore, are a good example [4] .",

These gatherings are by their nature crowded settings that can facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases, including human to human transmission of respiratory pathogens [9] . They can rapidly amplify transmission and may lead to the international spread of infections through the globalization or respiratory agents via returning participants [9, 10] . Furthermore, group prayer is also important in the Islamic religion. Mosques typically hold five group prayers each day in addition to the Friday midday prayer, which is often longer and attended by a larger number of worshipers. Saudi Arabia has robust preparedness and public health response capabilities strengthened by the valuable experience gained during its managing of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reported in 2012 and decades of planning religious mass gatherings in the face or numerous public health challenges. A testament to this is the Kingdom's recent successful planning and management of the Hajj in the midst of infectious diseases outbreaks and public health emergencies of international concern, including the H1N1 pandemic influenza and the SARS, MERS, rift valley fever, ZIKA and Ebola virus disease outbreaks [11] . KSA is currently drawing on these successful experiences to address the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Of note, on the 27 th of February 2020, the Kingdom suspended the Umrah mass gathering for the first time in many decades (Fig. 1 ). This bold measure was taken in the interest of public health despite its potential economic and political consequence as well as its personal financial, mental and emotional impact on pilgrims [14] .

On the 8 th of March 2020, the Saudi Ministry of Education declared the closure of schools and suspension of teaching at universities and other institutions until further notice to avoid the spread of the disease through these congregated settings. The decision covered all educational institutions, including public and private schools, and technical and vocational training establishments. Homeschooling and online teaching were promoted.

Since the 17 th of March 2020, call for prayer heard across the Kingdom instructs people to pray in their homes as to avoid close contact. The Kingdom's Two Holy Mosques in Makkah and Medina were also temporally closed for the public. The above measures were decisive and bold given the importance of religion in the Kingdom and the significance of KSA in the Muslim world. The temporary suspension of group prays and the temporary closure of the Two Holy Mosques, may be unpopular among some, yet, they are a welcomed action that could encourage other Muslim countries to take similar measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.",

Public transport brings people into close contact in a confined space and therefore is a risk for COVID-19 transmission. Taxis, in particular, are commonly used in the daily lives of many people in KSA. Taxi drivers are at an increased risk of acquiring the virus, given their close contact with their customers. The quick customer turnaround also means that a single case among taxi drivers could then transmit the virus to potentially a large number of people in the community.

The effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic continues. However, undoubtedly the success of these interventions and compliance with them are highly linked to effective risk communication with the public to convey the reasoning behind, and aims of, such actions. Risk communication has been and will remain and integral part of the Kingdom's effect to stop the spread of COVID-19. The Kingdom still faces important decisions in the current pandemic, notably a decision on the upcoming 2020 Hajj [18] . The pilgrimage is compulsory for all Muslims who are physically and financially able to perform it. Many Muslims around the world save and wait decades for the opportunity to perform Hajj, and a decision to suspend the Hajj would have a significant impact within and outside the Kingdom [11] . The decision on the 2020 Hajj will be an informed weighing between the risk of the pilgrimage going ahead and the consequence of it being suspended. The priority will be protecting the public and ensuring global health security.",

            "text": "The Saudi authorities are carefully monitoring the COVID-19 situation and the Kingdom will continue to take decisive and bold measures to safeguard its citizens, residents and visitors as well as the global community, even at a great socioeconomic cost. On a political front, the Kingdom leveraged its current presidency of the G20 to host an emergency summit on the COVID-19 pandemic, on the 26 th of March 2020, to advance the coordinated response. During this virtual summit, G20 leaders pledged their commitment to presenting a united front against the current pandemic, calling it their \"absolute priority\" to tackle its health, social and economic impacts. While experiences from China, South Korea and Singapore suggest that suppression of the spread is possible in short terms, social distancing and other draconian measures taken by various governments may not be sustainable long term if the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Also, transmission may quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed [19] . Hence, other strategies may need to be introduced as well as tactical decisions regarding the currently implemented measures [3, 17] . For instance, intermittent social distancing, informed by trends in disease surveillance data may be an option, where interventions could be relaxed temporarily for short periods and reinforced if the number of cases starts to rise [19] . Ultimately, if COVID-19 transmission continues, a drastic move from reactive to active measures to deal with the virus head-on will be required. Aggressive case finding and isolation, rigorous contact tracing, quarantining, and testing, as well as community-wide surveillance, will need to be implemented and sustained in addition to social distancing, travel and movement restrictions and other measures to help fight the pandemic [3] .
