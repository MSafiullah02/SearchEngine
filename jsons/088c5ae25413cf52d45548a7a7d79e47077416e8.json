The model, MIMANSA, divides an individual's in-person social interactions into three areas, namely home, workplace, and public places. While tracking the in-person interactions, the model follows the virus spread. Internally, the model labels healthy people who turn into silent carriers, virus-infected patients, or healthy carriers. It tracks down to the smallest level of a single day interaction. As and when a new silent carrier is created, the model automatically expands and builds a network of virus spread. All single-day blocks are integrated to get the final result. MIMANSA is novel due to its ability to build a virus spread network as a multilevel, integrated model, and in the end, enable one to make complex decisions with ease.",

It helps understand how COVID-19 may grow, what will be the scale of the number of cases in a given region, and how to get ready for handling it. Another important aspect is that a good model will enable administrators to come up with the right public policies. There are many questions that public policymakers have. Should one go for a lockdown of a city? If so, what is the correct duration before the lockdown is lifted? What is the impact of identifying and isolating silent carriers? How many hospital beds are required? How many ICU beds, and how many ventilators are needed? Questions are related to the effect of an increase in the number of cases, the impact of lockdown, lifting of the lockdown, mask usage, social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation. Although there are many attempts by now to develop mathematical models of COVID-19, it comes short of answering questions related to the impact of multiple measures and policies when they are implemented simultaneously.",

This is the same philosophy we have used in the development of the model described in this paper.

There is no provision for adding new silent carriers inherent in the ARMA model. If there is a sudden increase in the numbers due to unknown external factors, one has to recalculate the entire model. Fanelli and Piazza [11] forecasted cases in China, Italy, and France based on the classical SIRD model. In this approach, the Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Recovered (R), and the Dead (D) model, every person who is going to be infected by the virus, falls in one of the four categories. Then the equations are set up as first-order differential equations with one differential equation per stage. Wang et al. [35] present their work on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. They used the SEIRD model for the Wuhan data. Mandal et al. [21] used an SEIR model and suggested that screening at the port of entry for India may result in some delay in getting the Coronavirus in the country. However, screening at the port alone may not suffice in delaying the outbreak. Parodi and Liu [24] also address the containment issue.",

Consider, for example, P6 from group 2 and P 12 from group 3 have become silent carriers on day 1 (Fig. 2) . Both P6 and P12 have their respective families and a different network of people they interact, averaging 22 interactions each. To represent that, we create a new level, level 2. This is a vertical block in Fig. 5 . Vertical blocks are created whenever there are new possibilities for the in-person interactions in the network. The new levels are started by all the silent carriers coming from the top levels. If we are at level 20, we add all the silent carriers from level 19 and going back to level 5. This covers 14 levels in the past. The reason for going all the way up to 14 levels and no more is due to the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 being 14 days. There is no silent carrier that would continue to be a silent carrier beyond 14 days. This is how the virus spreads its network.

In terms of the virus spread, this means that the next day virus continues to spread. The spread during the next day depends on the count at the end of the previous day. Virus growth is a self-propelling system. Since we are building a self-propelling system, it has to have internal inputs that keep feeding back on the next day.

Since this patient has had very close contact with family members, the chances are high that the family could be infected.

If this family quarantining is implemented in 70% of the cases, then the CTQ is 0.7. The day from when such a policy is implemented is TCTQ, i.e., Start Time of Contact Tracing and Quarantining. The condition in the left decision block in Fig. 8 states that if a patient is found and if today the family quarantine policy is on, then do not send any members to the next horizontal block. As explained earlier, computations in every horizontal block mean interactions among the same members as on the previous day. The only difference is those who have been identified as Virus-infected patients, and those who have been quarantined will no longer be present to interact with others. When family quarantine policy is enforced, all members of the family, that is, the entire group 1, are isolated from the rest of the people. Thus, the number of members passed to the next computational block in group 1 are zero under quarantine enforcement. We have also considered one member of group1 who goes to the workplace and then mixes in public places as being group 2 and group 3, respectively. Since that one member is no longer interacting with people, the input 2 to group 2 is zero, and so is the input 3. However, in the absence of the family quarantine policy, input 1 is RHP1, the remaining family members who are not yet infected. The input 2 is the same as RHP2, the remaining healthy people in group2, and the input 3 is RHP3. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Thus, we have gradually changed the value of the lockdown percentage. 4. The Infection Rate (IR) was calculated using the data from COVID19India (India data,2020). Extensive contact tracing was done in India. All data related to the traced contact is also part of the dataset. Thus, one can find out how many people were infected by one individual. Using Del Valle's study [10] , we know that, on average, a person meets 22 people. By taking the ratio of people infected to the number of people met, one gets IR. The calculated value of IR is 0.12. We have adjusted it to 0.105 during the data training stage. 5. The value of IR reported in Germany is 28% and, in the US, it is 34% [26] 6. The number of people in each of the 3 groups are selected as follows. In general, it is reasonable to assume that a family consists of 4 people. At the workplace, one meets a limited number of people compared to in public places. As per Del Valle [10] one meets 22 people every day. With that total in mind, we select 8 people at the workplace, and 10 people in public places. Although these numbers may vary in individual cases, on average, it appears to be a reasonable distribution. 7. For selecting the exposure rate, we calculated the actual exposure rate among Italian doctors. In a survey, (8) , Italian doctors reported that 108 out of 272 had symptoms of COVID-19. Out of the 272 GPs, only 125 had direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. The ratio of those who had symptoms to those who were exposed is 0.864. Since ER (1) indicates the highest level of exposure, we can choose a number close to 0.78.",

The ER (2) is the medium level exposure rate. It is selected as 0.5. The ER (3) is the lowest exposure and is selected as 0.2. 9. The Silent Carrier Rate (SCR) is considered as 0.5. The Healthy Carrier Rate (HCR) is taken 0.2 since the possibility of fomite transmitted infection is low. The lockdown values were based on the news reports combined with a gut feeling. The lockdown dates and the change of conditions are mostly based on the news. 10. We consider 80% silent carriers, 15% hospitalized, and 5% needing ICU care. This is based on the study by Wu and Mc Googan [40] . This report is based on over 44000 cases studied. They found 81% of cases mild, 14% severe, and 5% critical. As per the WHO Q&A session [37] on March 17, 2020, \"For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. \" 11. The fatality rate is estimated to be in range 2 to 3% by Tanu Singhal [29] . 12. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus, yet they continue to show negative on the SARS-CoV-2 test. [15] 13. We conducted several simulations to get the best fit for the India data. Every parameter was adjusted carefully by keeping the values within the practical limits to ensure that the best-fit parameters are not merely a numerical play, but represent reality as closely as possible. 14. There are different opinions about the role of asymptomatic patients in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The initial thought process was that asymptomatic patients do not spread the virus. However, now there is evidence that asymptomatic people can infect others (Bai et al., [2] ) (Hu et al. [13] ). Since there is still no concurrence on the percentages, we consider that the virus transmission from symptomatic patients is 20%. We have also considered that asymptomatic patients are 50% of all the patients. Thus, 20% of 50% gives 10% of the total. This is the reduction factor (RF). ",

Silent Carriers (SCs) are multiplied by a reduction factor (RF) because out of all the silent carriers, 10% are likely to spread the infection. Further, if we consider the case of family quarantine, we also multiply SSC by the quarantine factor (1-Q), where is Q is the Quarantine flag. The quarantine flag is 0 if there is no quarantine. If the quarantine policy is applied, then the quarantine flag is equal to the Contact Tracing and Quarantine value (CTQ). Thus, we get Total Silent Carriers (TSC) when we apply reduction factor (RF) and 1-Q to Sum of Silent Carriers (SSC). The first block of every new level gets TSC as one of its inputs. But we only give the TSCs of the last 14 levels as input. For example, a new CB with time 17 and level 17 will get TSCs from CBs at time 16 and levels 3 to 16. The sum of 14 latest TSCs is called Silent Carrier at Present (SCP). The formula is given by: of computation at time t, TSC = New or incremental Silent cases, t = Current day count, The summation should be carried out until {( \u2212 i) > 0 ||( i = 14)}} As all Sum of Hidden Virus-infected Patient (SHVPs) and Silent Carrier at Present (SCPs) do not start infecting people at the same time, we distribute them over 14 days using a Probability Distribution Function (PDF), as shown in figure PDF Graph.
