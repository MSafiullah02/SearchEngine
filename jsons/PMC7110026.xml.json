The amount of parent DNA is the baseline, and increasing the amplification range would provide greater potential to detect finer differences between control and PCT samples. Mathematically, this is true because the preamplification conditions were normalized to equal the smallest amplicon, which was subjected to 8 preamplification cycles for B19 and to 14 preamplification cycles for HBV. Under the assumption of 100% PCR efficiency, 8 preamplification cycles increased the copy number of the 244\u2010bp amplicon by 28 or 2.6\u00d7102, just over 2 log; and 14 preamplification cycles, under the assumption of 100% efficiency, would yield 1.6 \u00d7 104 copies, or \u223c4 log. In the case of HBV, the PCR was not 100% efficient; therefore, the log range was \u223c3.6 log. The perfect imposition of all preamplification products for each virus showed that PCR efficiency decreased with increasing amplicon sizes; thus, to maintain the 2\u2010log B19 preamplification range, 10 cycles were needed for the 926\u2010bp amplicon, 16 for the 3\u2010kb amplicon, and 30 for the 5\u2010kb amplicon.

Statistically, PCT causes cross\u2010links in \u223c1 of every 83 bp; thus, the likelihood that the QPCR primers will amplify a region that lacks an adduct is very high. Therefore, although the parent DNA was cross\u2010linked by PCT, the QPCR assay failed to detect it.
