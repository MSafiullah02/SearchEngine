Smallpox in particular was always a dreaded killer. Indeed, even during the 1960s, at least 10 million cases of smallpox were reported annually from across the globe, leading to about 2 million deaths a year. Yet, today, the disease has been completely eradicated. In the last 30 years, there have been no known cases. Poliomyelitis or polio is the other large-scale disease which has come closest to eradication. Its success too has been formidable: in 1991, the Pan American Health Organization effectively eradicated polio from the Western Hemisphere, since when the Global Polio Eradication Programme has significantly decreased the overall incidence of Poliomyelitis through the rest of the world. In 1988, there were approximately 350,000 cases spread through 125 countries; in the past years, global figures amounted to less than 2,000 annually.",

There are over 70 common infectious diseases responsible for one in four deaths globally. Rotavirus and Pneumococcus are pathogens causing diarrhoea and pneumonia, the leading causes of infant deaths in underdeveloped countries. In the next decade, effective, widespread vaccination programs against such pathogenic microbes could save the lives of 7.6 million children under 5 years of age. Hepatitis B causes 600,000 deaths in adults and children aged over 5. Seasonal, non-pandemic influenza kills upwards of half a million globally each year. For those aged under 5 in particular, a series of diseases causes an extraordinary and largely preventable death toll. For example, tetanus accounts every year for 198,000 deaths, pertussis is responsible for over 290,000 deaths, Hib gives rise to in excess of 386,000 deaths, diphtheria accounts for 4,000 deaths, and yellow fever over 15,000 deaths. Arguably, the most regrettable, the most lamentable situation is that of measles. Measles accounts for the unneeded deaths of 540,000 under-fives and over 70,000 adults and older children.",

Set against this is the unfortunate realisation that vaccines exist for most easily targeted diseases, those mediated by neutralising antibodies, and so outstanding vaccine-targets are those more intractable disease mediated primarily by cellular immunity. To address those properly requires what all discoveries required: hard work and investment; but they also need new ideas, new thinking, and new vaccine discovery technology. Amongst, these are computational techniques, the most promising of which are those targeting the discovery of novel vaccine antigens: the candidate subunit vaccines of tomorrow.",

Undesired immunogenicity, the type leading to severe and pathological immune responses, rather than enduring immune memory, is concern for both whole-organism and subunit-based vaccines, as well as putative biologics [15]. Immunologists and vaccinologists have thus long sought alternatives to the use of whole organisms as vaccines. Subunit vaccines and conjugate vaccines are one such.

It may be that only the large and complex organism-sized vaccines can induce the range of immune responses necessary across the population to induce protection, since they comprise a potential host of immunogenic molecular moieties, not just a single immunodominant epitope.",

A less likely explanation would be that the island arose by mutation and selection in this species and no other. To decide, a body of extra evidence would need to be explored, such as the size of the PAI, the mechanistic ease of deletion, the consistent presence of the island in more distantly related species, the relative pathogenicity of island-less species, and the divergence of the genome relative to that of other related species.",

IslandPick is a comparative genomic island predictor, rather than a composition-based approach, that can identify very probable genomic islands and very probable non-genomic islands with investigated genomes but does require that several phylogentically related genomes are available [49]. Observing PAIs as having a G + C composition closer to their host genome, Wang et al. used so-called genomic barcodes to identify PAIs. These barcodes are based on the fact that the frequencies of 2-mers to 7-mers, and their reverse complement, are very stable across a whole genome when using a window size of over 1,000 bps and that this constituted a characteristic signature for genomes [55].",

Are high-scoring matches an artefact or are they real and meaningful? The litany of such conditions is all too familiar to anyone well versed in sequence similarity searching. Clearly, when a sequence search is run, using BLAST or FASTA3, for example, an enormously long list of nearly identical proteins might ensue, or one that does not get any hits at all, or almost any intervening result might be obtained. As reflective practitioners, we must judge which result can be classified as useful and which cannot, and in so doing, identify sets of suitable thresholds, above which we expect usefulness and below which we might anticipate little or no utility. Thresholds are contingent upon the sequence family studied, as well as being dependent solely on the problem investigated.

The IEDB database is considerably more extensive than other equivalent database systems, benefiting from the input of 13 dedicated epitope sequencing projects. IEDB has come to eclipse other work in this area. Although both AntiJen and IEDB are full of epitope-focussed information of many flavours, they remain incomplete concerning immunogenic antigens.

An Expert System might make financial forecasts, or play chess; it might diagnose human illnesses or schedule the routes of delivery vehicles. To create an expert system, one first needs to analyse human experts and how they make decisions, before translating this into rules that a computer can follow. Such a system leverages both a knowledge base of accumulated expertise and a set of rules for applying such distilled knowledge to particular situations in order to solve problems. Sophisticated expert systems can be updated with new knowledge and rules and can also learn from the success of its prediction, again mirroring the behaviour of properly performing experts.",

This approach seeks to amalgamate the output of various predictors, typically internet servers, in an intelligent way so that the combined result is more accurate than any of those coming from a single predictor. Indeed, combining results from multiple prediction tools does often increase overall accuracy. A consensus strategy was first proposed by Mallios [133], who combined SYFPEITHI [60,61,134], ProPred [135,136], and the iterative stepwise discriminant analysis meta-algorithm [137\u2013139]. MULTIPRED [140] integrates HMMs and artificial neural networks (ANN). Six MHC class II predictors were combined by Dai and co-workers [141\u2013143] basing its overall prediction on the probability distributions of the different scores. Trost et al. have used a heuristic method to address class I peptide-MHC binding [144]. Wang et al. [145] applied a consensus method to calculate the median rank of the top three predictive methods for each MHC class II protein initially evaluated so as to rank all possible 8-, 9-, and 10-mers from one protein. This rank was used to identify the top 1 % of peptides from each protein.",

The immune responses is comprised, at least for whole-pathogen vaccines, of the adaptive immune response to multiple B cell and T cell epitopes as well as the responses made by the innate immune responses to diverse molecular structures, principally PAMPs. When one considers also the degree to which such a repertoire of responses is augmented and modified by the action of additives, be they designed to increase the durability and stability of vaccines or be they adjuvants, which are intended to raise the level of immune reactions. Add in stochastic and coincidental phenomena, such as reversion to pathogenicity, and we can see immediately that navigating our way through the vaccine minefield is no easy task. All such problems engendered by this intrinsic complexity are themselves compounded by our comparatively weak understanding of immunological mechanisms, since, if we understood the mechanism of responses well enough, we could and would have designed our vaccines to circumvent these issues.",

A proper understanding of the relationships between gene variants and vaccine-specific immune responses may help us to design the next generation of personalised vaccines. Vaccinomics addresses this issue directly. It seeks to identify genetic factors mediating or moderating vaccine-induced immune responses, which are known to be extremely variable within population. Much data indicate that host genetic polymorphisms are key determinants of innate and adaptive response to vaccination. HLA genes, non-HLA genes, and genes of the innate immunity all contribute, and do so in many ways, to the variation observed between individuals for immune responses to microbial vaccines. Vaccinomics offers many techniques that can help illuminate these diverse phenomena. Principal amongst these are population-based gene/SNP association studies between allele or SNP variation and specific responses, supplemented by the application of next-generation sequencing technology and microarray approaches.",

Vaccines based on APCs and peptides are new but unproven strategies; most modern vaccine development relies instead on effective searches for vaccine antigens.",

Some of his factors overlap with the factors from Figure. He identified many of the factors that potentially contribute to the immunogenicity of proteins, be they of pathogen origin or another source entirely, and also other features which might make proteins particularly suitable for becoming candidate vaccines. Of these, some are as-yet beyond prediction, such as the attractiveness for APCs or the inability to down-regulate immune responses. The status of proteins as evasins is currently only possibly addressable through sequence similarity-based approaches and likewise for the attractiveness for uptake by APCs is again, though possible there exist motifs, structural or sequence, which could be identified. Currently, the dearth of relevant data precludes prediction of such properties; and, while it is possible to predict some of these properties with some assurance of success, and others are predictable but only incidentally, overall, we are still some way from realising the dream embodied in Fig. 3.4.\n",

A vaccine candidate should have epitopes that the host recognises, be available for immune surveillance, and be highly expressed. Factors mediating protein immunogenicity are many; possession of B or T cell epitopes, post-translational danger signals, sub-cellular location, protein expression levels, and aggregation state amongst them.

The computational stage can be empirical in nature; this is typified by the statistical approach embodied in vaxijen [115]. Or this stage can be bioinformatic; this involves predicting subcellular location and expression levels and the like.
