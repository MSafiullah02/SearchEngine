Uptake was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry after treating cultured cells or live rainbow trout with 3\u00a2 fluorescein-tagged PMO. Arginine-rich peptide conjugated to the 5\u00a2 end of the PMO markedly enhanced cellular uptake in culture by 8-to 20-fold compared with non-peptide-conjugated PMO as determined by flow cytometry. Enhanced uptake of PMO conjugated to peptide was also observed in tissues of fish treated by immersion. The efficacy of PMO as inhibitors of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) replication was determined in vitro. Peptide-conjugated PMOs targeting sequences within the IHNV genomic RNA (negative polarity) or antigenomic RNA (positive polarity) significantly inhibited replication in a dosedependent and sequence-specific manner. A PMO complementary to sequence near the 5\u00a2 end of IHNV genomic RNA was the most effective, diminishing titre by 97%, as measured by plaque assay and Western blot. These data demonstrate that replication of a negative-stranded non-segmented RNA virus can be inhibited by antisense compounds that target positive polarity viral RNA, or by a compound that targets negative polarity viral RNA.",

            "text": "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) has a negative-sense non-segmented RNA genome, and belongs to the genus Novirhabdovirus, in the family Rhabdoviridae. Viral genomic RNA acts as a direct template for the RNA synthesis events of transcription and replication. In the process of transcription six monocistronic mRNAs are synthesized, which are then translated into individual proteins. In the process of replication, a full-length positive-strand replicative intermediate RNA is synthesized and this becomes the template for the production of progeny genomic RNAs. \u00d4Antige-nomic\u00d5 RNA refers in this paper to both mRNA and replicative intermediate RNA. The major distinguishing feature of Novirhabdovirus is the presence of a non-virion gene between the glycoprotein and the polymerase genes (Kurath, Higman & Bjorklund 1997) . The six genes of IHNV are present in the genome in the following order: 3\u00a2-N-P(M1)-M(M2)-G-NV-L-5\u00a2, where N is the nucleocapsid protein, P or M1 is the phosphoprotein, M or M2 is the matrix protein, G is the glycoprotein, NV is the non-virion protein, and L is the polymerase protein (Kurath, Ahern, Pearson & Leong 1985; Morzunov, Winton & Nichol 1995) .",

IHNV is an economically important fish pathogen, causing severe acute infections in young salmonid fish and resulting in high mortalities. Depending upon the species of fish, strain of the virus, and environmental conditions, outbreaks of IHNV may result in losses of 80-100% when young fish are infected. Once clinical signs become apparent, the disease is usually irreversible and fatal. Following a disease outbreak, surviving fish may become virus carriers without showing obvious signs (Kim, Dummer, Chiou & Leong 1999) . Presently, the only control measure for the spread of IHNV is by destruction of infected stocks. Although effective DNA vaccines to IHNV have been developed and tested under laboratory conditions (Anderson, Mourich, Fahrenkrug, LaPatra, Shepherd & Leong 1996; Alonso, Johnson, Simon & Leong 2003) , these are not yet commercially available. The requirements for low cost, ease of application and safety have restricted their commercial development for aquaculture. Such issues will need to be addressed before large-scale application of DNA vaccines on fish farms is adopted. However, taking into consideration aspects of safety and ease of administration, antiviral agents may be a more feasible approach to the control of IHNV infection and disease.",

            "text": "Sequence-specific oligomers designed to inactivate selected messenger RNAs (the sense strands) are commonly called \u00d4antisense\u00d5 oligos. Antisense oligomers of various structural types have been used to inhibit the gene expression of several viral pathogens (Ma, Rede, Naqvi & Cook 2000) . The first antisense compound to receive FDA approval for use in humans, a therapeutic for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, targets the IE-2 gene of CMV (Green, Roh, Pippin & Drebin 2000) . Antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are a new class of antisense agents with high specificity and efficacy (Stein, Foster, Huang, Weller & Summerton 1997; Summerton, Stein, Huang, Matthews, Weller & Partridge 1997; Schmajuk, Sierakowska & Kole 1999) . They contain purine or pyrimidine bases attached to a backbone composed of 6-member morpholine rings joined by phosphordiamidate inter-subunit linkages and are usually synthesized to be 20-25 subunits long. PMO are sequence-specific, uncharged, water soluble and nuclease resistant (Hudziak, Barofsky, Barofsky, Weller, Huang & Weller 1996; Summerton & Weller 1996) . PMO bind to RNA by Watson-Crick base pairing, and can prevent translation by steric blocking of translation initiation with minimal toxicity Ghosh, Stein, Weller & Iversen 2000) . Regions of mRNA sequence that are likely to be effective targets for PMO antisense agents can be predicted with relative ease and usually involve either RNA splice sites or the region comprising the 5\u00a2-untranslated region, AUG translational start codon and the first 20 or so bases of protein coding sequence Giles, Spiller, Clark & Tidd 1999; Ghosh et al. 2000) . PMO have demonstrated efficacious, specific, and non-toxic reduction of target protein levels in a number of tissue cultures (Arora, Knapp, Smith, Statdfield, Stein, Reddy, Weller & Iversen 2000; Hudziak, Summerton, Weller & Iversen 2000; Nasevicius & Ekker 2000; Kipshidze, Kim, Iversen, Yazdi, Bhargava, New, Mehran, Tio, Haudenschild, Dangas, Stone, Iyer, Roubin, Leon & Moses 2002) . Further, these studies have established PMOs as essentially nontoxic agents with favourable pharmacokinetic properties (Iversen, Arora, Acker, Mason & Devi 2003) . PMOs have demonstrated the ability to inhibit replication of vesivirus (a calicivirus) (Stein, Skilling, Iversen & Smith 2001) , and mouse hepatitis virus (a coronavirus) (Neuman, Stein, Kroeker, Paulino, Moulton, Iversen & Buchmeier 2004) . The goals of this study were to determine whether efficient and non-toxic delivery of PMO into fish cells and tissues is possible, and if so, whether replication of IHNV could be inhibited by PMO complementary to either antigenomic or genomic RNA.",

            "text": "The PMOs were synthesized at AVI BioPharma (Corvallis, OR, USA) as previously described (Summerton & Weller 1996) . The chemical structure of the PMO backbone is shown in Fig. 1a . Purity of full-length oligomers was >95% as determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and MALDI TOF mass spectroscopy. Membrane-penetrating peptide was covalently conjugated to the 5\u00a2 end of the PMO with the cross-linker N-[c-maleimidobutyryloxy] succinimide ester (Moulton, Hase, Smith & Iversen 2003) . The conjugated peptides used in this study were designated as P002 (RRRQRRKKRC) (Moul-ton et al. 2003) and P003 (RRRRRRRRRFFC) (Moulton, Nelson, Hatlevig, Reddy & Iversen 2004 ). Both peptides were custom synthesized by Global Peptide Services (Fort Collins, CO, USA) and purified to >90% purity. Details of the conjugation process and purification of peptideconjugated PMOs has been previously described (Moulton et al. 2003 . Table 1 and Fig. 1b show the nomenclature, sequences and targeting locations in the IHNV genome of the PMOs used in this study. PMOs were designed to target the AUG translation initiation regions of the N and G genes of the Round Butte 1 (RB1) isolate of IHNV (GenBank accession numbers U50401 and U50402, respectively). As the RB1 isolate of IHNV has not been completely sequenced, a PMO to target the L gene translation-initiation region was designed according to the sequence reported for the IHNV WRAC isolate (GenBank accession no. L40883). An additional compound (P003-L 3\u00a2 PMO) was designed to hybridize to sequence near the 5\u00a2-terminus of the IHNV negative-strand genomic RNA. The four PMOs described above were conjugated to P003 peptide. G and L Figure 1 (a) Chemical structure of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). The deoxyribose of DNA is replaced by a 6-membered morpholine ring, and the phosphodiester internucleoside bond is replaced by a phosphorodiamidate linkage in the PMO structure. Arginine-rich peptide, when present, is conjugated to the 5\u00a2 end of a PMO through the illustrated linker. Arginine-rich peptide sequences used in this work are described in Materials and methods. Fluorescein, when present, is conjugated directly to the nitrogen of the morpholine ring, on the 3\u00a2 end of the PMO. (b) Targeting localizations in the IHNV genome of the PMOs used in this study. translation-initiation region PMO, without P003 peptide conjugation, were also prepared. A scrambled-sequence version of the P003-N PMO and a second irrelevant sequence control compound were also synthesized and conjugated to P003 peptide in an identical manner as the antisense compounds, to serve as controls for any generic non-sequence-specific activity of the P003-PMO chemistry. In order to permit analysis of the uptake of PMO forms into fish cell lines by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry, carboxyfluorescein was conjugated to the 3\u00a2-end of a random-sequence PMO (PMO-FITC). The same fluorescein-tagged random sequence PMO was also 5\u00a2-conjugated to P002 peptide (P002-PMO-FITC) and P003 peptide (P003-PMO-FITC). All the lyophilized PMOs used in this study were dissolved in sterile water prior to use in culture cells.",

Two fish cell lines were evaluated, epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells (Fijan 1983 ) and a Chinook salmon embryonic cell line (CHSE-214) (Lannan, Winton & Fryer 1984) , in order to investigate cell-to-cell variation. The EPC cell line was obtained from Dr Sara Perez (Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Spain) and the CHSE-214 cells from the ATCC. To investigate the ability of PMO to inhibit IHNV infection, CHSE-214 cells were grown in duplicate 6-well plates at 17\u00b0C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm l-glutamine. Prior to treatment with PMO compounds, confluent cell monolayers were rinsed twice with RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine. Following the removal of the second rinse, 2 mL of RPMI-10% FBS containing an appropriate PMO or corresponding volume of dH 2 O was added. Cells and medium were then incubated overnight at 17\u00b0C. The next day, log dilutions of IHNV (RB1 isolate) in MEM-2% FBS (200 lL per well) were added. After 1 h of adsorption at 15\u00b0C, virus inoculum was removed and quantification of virus was performed by plaque assay following the method of Burke & Mulcahy (1980) . After 10 days of incubation at 15\u00b0C to allow IHNV plaque formation, the monolayers were fixed and stained with a crystal violet solution [0.25% crystal violet, 10% ethanol and 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] for 48 h, and the number of plaque-forming units were scored. CHSE-214 cells infected with log dilutions of IHNV but receiving mock treatment with water only, as well as PMO-treated cells without IHNV infection, were included as controls.",

The lower blot shows the 43-kDa band generated with a b-actin antibody. Sample designations that appear above the lanes apply to both blots and correspond to the sample numbers above in Fig. 4a .",

P003-L PMO treatment resulted in little inhibition of IHNV viral titre except at 20 lm (Fig. 5a) . Similar results were obtained with the P003-N PMO (Fig. 5c) . Treatment with P003-L 3\u00a2 PMO yielded no inhibition at 0.2, 1 or 2 lm, moderate inhibition at 10 lm and marked inhibition (97%) of IHNV infection at 20 lm (Fig. 5b) . Treatments (20 lm) of P003-L PMO, P003-L 3\u00a2 PMO or P003-N PMOs were not toxic to mockinfected cells, as assessed visually. Cells remained attached to the plate and no change in the colour of the culture medium was observed. Additionally, cells treated with P003-N Scramble PMO at 20 lm showed no inhibition of IHNV titre (Fig. 5c) .",

After 20 min of treatment and a subsequent 1 h of rinse-immersion, fish from each treatment group were killed by anaesthetic overdose and the gills excised, observed visually on a fluorescence microscope and photographed (Fig. 6 ). P003-PMO-FITC was diffusely distributed throughout the gill tissue and generated intense fluorescent staining (Fig. 6c) . In contrast, the fluorescence throughout the gill tissues of the PMO-FITC- treated fish (Fig. 6a ) or P002-PMO-FITC-treated fish (Fig. 6b) was very weak. The viscera of animals from each treatment group were homogenized and examined for whole-body fluorescence using a fluorometer. When data from the homogenates of the P003-PMO-FITC replicate fish were pooled, a 565 mean value of fluorescence signal was obtained. In contrast, a 502 value of fluorescence signal was detected from the homogenates of PMO-FITC-treated fish. A background autofluorescence signal of 395 was recorded for untreated fish. These results indicate that PMO and peptide-conjugated PMO can apparently associate with and/or be taken up by fish tissues and that the P003 peptide is an effective PMO delivery enhancer.",

In the present study, peptideconjugated PMOs tagged with fluorescein were efficiently delivered into two fish cell types in culture, under standard incubation conditions, as shown by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. The data showed that CHSE-214 cells exhibited higher levels of fluorescence than EPC cells when incubated with these compounds. Both cell lines showed individual cells with diffuse, apparently cytoplasmic signal, as well as fluorescent nuclei, indicating delivery was extensive into both major cellular compartments. The highest amount of intracellular fluorescence was observed in the P003-PMO-FITC treated cells. The ability of the P003 peptide to deliver PMO across biological membranes was characterized previously in HeLa cells . Our results indicate that the P003 peptide also significantly enhances delivery and activity of PMO in fish cell lines. The uptake of P003-PMO was clearly mediated by P003, as incubation of either cell line with PMO lacking peptide conjugation yielded no intracellular fluorescent signal.",

            "text": "In the present work, P003-PMO directed against either IHNV RNA polymerase or nucleoprotein were shown to inhibit viral amplification. The effects observed were sequence specific and dose dependent. Considerable inhibition of viral titre was observed when infected cells were incubated with 15 lm of P003-N, P003-L 3\u00a2 or P003-L PMOs with 64, 54 and 49% of inhibition, respectively. When the cells were incubated with 20 lm concentration of the same PMOs 69, 97 and 60% inhibitions were recorded, indicating a concentration-dependent inhibition of IHNV amplification by these compounds. Treatment with P003-G PMO at a dose of 15 lm resulted in only 23% inhibition of the IHNV titre. We assume that the minimal impact on viral titre by this compound reflects either (i) inaccessibility of the target sequence to the P003-G PMO compound, (ii) poor avidity of duplexing between compound and RNA target sequence, or (iii) successful hybridization, but a lack of effect on IHNV amplification by the resultant lowered amounts of G-gene product. A P003-PMO (P003-N Scramble PMO) with no significant homology to any IHNV or salmonid cellular sequences, showed no inhibition of IHNV growth at concentrations up to 20 lm, providing evidence that the IHNV antisense-PMOs used in this study were not cytotoxic and had biological impact solely through a target-specific antisense mode of action.",

            "text": "P003-L 3\u00a2 PMO, which is complementary to the 5\u00a2-end of the negative-strand viral genome, was shown to be the most potent inhibitor of IHNV replication tested, almost completely blocking IHNV amplification at a concentration of 20 lm. The reduced intensity of the 67-kDa G-protein band on a Western blot supports the observations of reduced viral titre. This compound was designed somewhat inadvertently, but fortuitously is complementary to sequence located approximately 155-175 nucleotides (nt) from the 5\u00a2 terminus of the genomic (negative) strand. This location is within the L gene, the 5\u00a2 end of which is at approximately 150 nt before the 5\u00a2 terminus of the genomic strand. The sequence that comprises the 59 5\u00a2 terminal nt of the genomic strand is known as the \u00d4trailer region\u00d5, and its integrity has been demonstrated as critical to proper transcription (Whelan & Wertz 1999b ) and virion assembly (Whelan & Wertz 1999a ) in vesicular stomatitis virus, a related rhabdovirus. Fig. 7 shows an M-fold secondary structure diagram of 140 nt of IHNV genomic RNA that comprises the P003-L 3\u00a2 PMO binding region and surrounding sequence. This diagrammed region shows a series of stable stem loops and indicates that the P003-L 3\u00a2 PMO binding region is located in a region that is particularly highly ordered. The diagram shown had the highest DG value for any of the predicted configuration variations offered by the folding program (data not shown). We speculate that disruption of this putative stem loop located near the 5\u00a2 terminus of the genomic RNA may have contributed to the high inhibition of IHNV amplification observed. PMOs complementary to IHNV antigenomic RNA such as P003-N PMO, P003-G PMO or P003-L PMO also showed inhibition of IHNV replication, but to a much lesser extent. Although translational arrest certainly represents an important mechanism of action for antisense drugs, our results suggest that PMO interaction with the 5\u00a2 end of the viral negative strand profoundly affects IHNV replication in cell culture, and could represent a potent antiviral compound. The success of an antisense PMO probably depends, to some extent, on its molar ratio to its target RNA. It may be that the superior efficacy of the PMO with a negative-strand target compared with that of a PMO with a positive-strand target was due to the lower molar amount of negative-strand genomic RNA target compared with the amount of positive strand targets (i.e. many mRNA molecules for a given target, in addition to full-length positive-strand replicative-intermediate RNA). In addition, the strong antiviral effect of the genomic-targeted PMO may be due, in part, to the fact that it affects viral transcription early in the viral replication cycle. This is the first report of PMO challenge of a rhabdovirus. The efficacy afforded by PMOs targeting sequences in the antigenomic L-and N-genes, and sequences in the terminal portion of the L-gene genomic RNA, may represent productive targeting guidance for use of this technology against other negative-stranded non-segmented RNA viruses.
