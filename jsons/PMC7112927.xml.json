HIV testing and counseling have been recognized as entry points for prevention, care, treatment, and support (WHO, 2004). Recently, rapid serological HIV tests have been introduced to facilitate radical scaling up of HIV testing and counseling services in many settings, such as in diagnosing and treating sexually transmitted infections, in services providing and linked to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and in general medical settings (WHO, 2004). It has been shown that sequential combinations of two or three antibody (Ab) tests (ELISA and/or rapid tests) are reliable for confirming HIV-positivity (WHO, 2004, Aghokeng et al., 2004, Carvalho et al., 1996, Meda et al., 1999). However, considering that the fourth generation HIV ELISA test, which can detect both HIV P24 antigen and HIV antibody in the same sample simultaneously, has been introduced to detect early-stage HIV infection (Meda et al., 1999) and that a combined antigen\u2013antibody rapid test for diagnosing HIV will be introduced soon (Keren et al., 2008), a method for detecting rapidly HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA to confirm HIV diagnosis in these settings would be a valuable diagnostic aid.",

The diverse nature of HIV causes difficulties in nucleotide-based diagnoses of HIV infection. In addition, low HIV DNA burden and low concentrations of HIV RNA in plasma often result in failure to detect HIV RNA or DNA in clinical specimens (Zazzi et al., 1995). These two factors, high diversity and low plasma RNA/proviral DNA concentration, limit the ability to diagnose HIV infection reliably and efficiently.",

            "text": "The reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay developed by Notomi is a simple method for nucleotide-based diagnostics that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity (Notomi et al., 2000). This method relies on auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis by a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity and a set of two each of specially designed inner and outer primers. The entire RT-LAMP procedure can be completed in a single step at a constant temperature without a programmed thermal cycler. LAMP provides highly efficient DNA amplification, up to 109\u20131010 times in 15\u201360 min, and the concentration of the LAMP product is much higher than that generated by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conventional PCR is relatively time consuming (3\u20134 h) and much more complicated than RT-LAMP, requiring several amplification steps and the use of a high-precision thermal cycler. The RT-LAMP assay has been validated and applied to the rapid detection of a number of RNA viruses, such as rubella virus (Mori et al., 2006), Japanese encephalitis virus (Toriniwa and Komiya, 2006), influenza virus (Ito et al., 2006), mumps virus (Okafuji et al., 2005), West Nile virus (Parida et al., 2004), severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (Hong et al., 2004, Poon et al., 2005), measles virus (Fujino et al., 2005), dengue virus (Parida et al., 2005), respiratory syncytial virus (Ushio et al., 2005), and HIV-1 (Curtis et al., 2008).",

Although the amount of HIV-1 RT-LAMP products was monitored by a real-time turbidimeter (LA-200) in the current study, the results of visual inspection were consistent with those determined by turbidimeter (data not shown). According to the manufacturer's instructions for the Loopamp DNA amplification kit, visual detection can be enhanced by the addition of Fluorescent Detection Reagent to the reaction mixture.

Future evaluation of the direct use of plasma or serum after heating as a test material is warranted (Curtis et al., 2008).",

Once the RNA extraction method is simplified, the group-M HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay will be ideal for use in resource-limited settings.",
