During chest compression, photos were taken with a frame rate of 5.5 frames per second from a fixed angle. In our study protocol we analysed the potential risk by choosing the picture showing the most aerosol-spread for each setting. At first, aerosolspread was detected during compression-only-CPR. In a second approach, we attached a face mask followed by an oxygen mask with reservoir on the patients face. Afterwards we inserted supraglottic airway devices, such as a laryngeal tube (LTS-D, VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz a. N., Germany) and different laryngeal masks (i-gel\u00ae, Intersurgical GmbH, Sank Augustin, Germany; Ambu\u00ae AuraOnce\uf0d4, Ambu GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany). In a stepwise approach we tested all supraglottic airway devices connected and not connected to an airway filter (DAR\uf0d4 Adult-Pediatric Electrostatic Filter HME, Covidien Ireland Limited, Tullamore, Ireland). Additionally, the aerosol-spread of intermittent bag-mask ventilation and during laryngoscopy was visualized. Since three cadavers were available for our study, we could only demonstrate limited techniques on the cadaver model due to the rapid deterioration of the mechanical properties of the lung during CPR. The other techniques were visualized while using the ex situ model. We evaluated the extend and direction of the aerosol-spread by visual estimation based on the acquired pictures.

In their Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) suggests that chest compressions have the potential to generate aerosol [9] . This accords to previous publications and guidelines [1] [2] [3] . That seems reasonable since chest compressions generates passive ventilation with small tidal volumes [10] . According to a recent systematic review, there is no evidence for or against aerosol production during chest compressions. We do not know if and when data about aerosol generation during chest compressions will be available. Concerning this ongoing lack of information, we focused our investigation about methods to reduce the spread of artificial generated aerosol during chest compression. Our study therefore investigates protection J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f against a potential harm, not against a proven harm [4] . In this context our model is designed to generate artificial aerosol which may or may not be generated by chest compression or positive pressure ventilation during CPR. At this juncture there is little data or recommendation for CPR in times of COVID-19. The Resuscitation Council UK recommends using a face mask for oxygen therapy to minimize aerosol-spread during CPR [7] . At the moment, there is insufficient data whether the potential risk for healthcare providers during CPR may be caused by droplets or aerosol. Data from chest physiotherapy and non-invasive ventilation suggests the spread of droplets and not aerosol during these procedures [11] .",

An inserted laryngeal tube with an airway filter may be effective to reduce both, aerosol and droplet spread. In our simulation, applying a face mask leads to deflection of simulated aerosol but seems not to be sufficient. The use of an oxygen mask with or without flow led to diffuse spread of aerosol. Our findings suggest that the early insertion of a laryngeal tube or a laryngeal mask connected to an airway filter during chest compression reduces the aerosolspread. Since a lot of inpatient cases develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), early airway management and oxygenation are the mainstay of the treatment for acute deterioration or cardiac arrest [12] . There is data showing non-inferiority for supraglottic airway devices versus endotracheal intubation in out of hospital cardiac arrest [13, 14] .",

            "text": "Endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients is a high risk procedure and should be performed by specialists with maximum expertise to reduce the risk of infection [1, 3, 7, 15] . This procedure may be delayed due to donning of personal protection equipment (PPE) of a specialised team. Furthermore, bag mask ventilation (BMV) also seems to have a high risk for infection and should be avoided [3] . We suppose that you need a continuously tight-fitting mask on the patients face to reduce aerosol-spread during BVM, which needs two hands for e.g. a double C-E technique. Especially based on safety precautions, this seems not practical during CPR in our opinion. The early insertion of a supraglottic airway device by any advanced life support provider particularly for staff protection may be an alternative in the setting of cardiac arrest since its quickly insertion from a bigger distance compared to direct laryngoscopy. Video-assisted laryngoscopy covered by a clear drape may reduce aerosolspread. Performance of airway management -even before starting chest compression -is in contrast with actual guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council [16] . Early airway management in cardiac arrest of COVID-19 seems to be reasonable since literature names respiratory failure the main cause of death in these patients [17] . Despite using a difficult airway trainer to simulate human upper airway, it remains a low-fidelity simulation. In our simulation model we used continuous air flow on the nebulizer to simulate aerosolgeneration. To create realistic conditions at the cadaver model we filled the residual volume with aerosol and did not apply any continuous flow. Because of an ethanol-based fixation detergent, the human cadavers provide more realistic conditions referring to elasticity of the thorax and mechanical properties of the lung. Still the residual capacity of the lungs may be reduced due to partial filling with the ethanol-based agent for fixing the cadavers. Because of this, our cadaver model may underestimate the amount of air exiting the lung during chest compression. Since the amount of dead space might differ between the cadavers, the amount of aerosol expelled by chest compressions might also differ. In patient care, dead space anatomy will also be variable. Both components of our experimental setup showed very similar results, giving us confidence about the validity of the chest compression simulation model. Nevertheless, we do not know how close we can get to realistic conditions using an aerosol-spreading model like this. Citing the ICLOR statement, there remains a knowledge gap about the potential for aerosol generation during CPR. [9] As an additional limitation, we do not know whether aerosol or droplet spread during CPR translates to an actual transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 to the healthcare providers. In spite of that, our simulation model is easy to build and may be a good tool for clinical training. We believe that we basically imitated an aerosol-spread during chest compressions with our experimental setup. For further confirmation we applied this model to human cadaver and saw our first results fundamentally confirmed. Both setups are still models of aerosol-spread, but we generally see comparability to human resuscitation. Resuscitation studies are worthwhile, but difficult to perform. Further investigations as for instance measurements of environmental virus particles may generate more precise answers about contagiosity during CPR.",

To visualize aerosol-spread we nebulized different disinfection detergents detectable by ultraviolet light (Ecolab\u00ae magic blue, Ecolab Deutschland GmbH, Monheim am Rhein, Germany; Bode visirub\u00ae conc., Bode Chemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany; Schuelke S&M\u00ae Optik, Schuelke & Mayr GmbH, Wien, Oesterreich). While applying an air flow of 8 l/min to the nebulizer, chest compression on the resuscitation dummy was performed. The airflow of 8 l/min was the minimum flow required to generate adequate aerosol for visualization using ultraviolet sensitive detergents with approach we visualized aerosol-spread during CPR in a human cadaver model in cooperation with the Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen. Ethical approval was given by the ethics committee of the University of Tuebingen (Project No.: 226/2020BO2). The human cadavers were fixed with an ethanolbased technique. To fill the airway and lungs with ultraviolet sensitive detergent, we used a commonly used self-inflating bag (Ambu\u00ae SPUR\u00ae II, Ambu GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany)",
