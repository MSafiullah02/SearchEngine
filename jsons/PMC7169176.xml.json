            "text": "The role of microbes and infection in obstructive lung disease was first proposed in the 1950s by the British hypothesis. This states that recurrent infection and mucus hypersecretion were the primary causes of progressive airways obstruction in smokers. However, subsequent studies failed to detect significant associations between infection and lung function decline and consequently exposure to noxious particles and gases was advanced as the principal cause of COPD.1 A wealth of evidence shows that the isolation of bacteria, viruses and fungi in the airways of stable COPD patients is in fact significant and has implications for disease pathogenesis, progression and treatment. This places a renewed emphasis on microorganisms isolated from the COPD lung, driving us to revisit the original British hypothesis.2 Advances in diagnostic technologies now permit a more accurate detection of specific pathogens in COPD while molecular studies shed light on the immune response elicited by COPD\u2010associated microorganisms. Metagenomic studies have revealed microbial consortia in both healthy and diseased individuals, helping to define pathogenic and beneficial microbes associated with various disease states. This has major implications for our understanding of COPD and its therapy, particularly in the face of antibiotic\u2010mediated lung dysbiosis during therapy. Therefore, both acute and chronic infections are linked to COPD progression and exist as components of overarching lung microbiome architecture, which is modulated during therapeutic intervention. Characterizing this dynamic interaction between microbes, therapy and disease states is now a central focus in COPD research. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in COPD\u2010associated pathogens is also a growing international concern and greater emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship and rational therapies is of increasing importance. Ultimately, the role of microbes and infection in COPD may reveal novel prognostic markers of disease which in turn provide scope for more focused interventions and novel therapeutic approaches.",

            "text": "Periodic worsening of respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD is known as acute exacerbations (AECOPD). They can have marked effects on lung function, quality of life and health socio\u2010economic burden. The exact nature and cause of these events can often be difficult to establish clinically, but in general infections are largely blamed, with up to 80% of AECOPD linked to either bacterial or viral pathogens.3, 4 Because a certain subset of COPD patients have frequent exacerbations, the concept of inherent susceptibility to acute infection in COPD subsequently triggering AECOPD events has been developed. Several studies have now demonstrated that COPD patients feature impaired innate immunity, the first line of defence against infection. Alveolar macrophages resident in the airways provide the key initial response to bacteria by both recognizing and removing harmful pathogens through phagocytosis, but in COPD, these functions may be impaired. Recently, Berenson et al. investigated Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) expression and responses in alveolar macrophages collected from exacerbation\u2010prone and exacerbation\u2010free COPD patients.5 In response to exposure to common COPD\u2010related pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, alveolar macrophages from exacerbation\u2010prone patients had diminished TLR2 expression and cytokine responses. Similarly, alveolar macrophages from COPD patients appear to phagocytose H. influenzae and S. pneumonia poorly compared with those of control patients yet they still release reactive oxygen species (ROS).6, 7 Together, these studies suggest that COPD patients have impaired responses to bacterial colonization and infection which in turn increases susceptibility to AECOPD and promotes an oxidative stress response (Fig. 1).",

Recognition of viral infection by the innate immune system is essential for coordinating an effective antiviral response in the airways, yet in patients and mice with COPD, the cascade from recognition to response falters. This involves increases in phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase responses and impaired antiviral stress granule formation including type I interferon (IFN) signalling.8 In the healthy host, pathogen recognition by TLR3 triggers IFN pathways that then can hinder viral replication and mediate adaptive immune responses. In epithelial cells, constitutive type 1 IFNs are critical for protection.9, 10 In these cells and lung fibroblasts exposed to cigarette smoke, responses are reduced and even stimulation with IFN\u2010\u03b2 yields a diminished antiviral response.11 Furthermore, mucociliary clearance, which is key for the removal of virus from the airways, appears to be perturbed in COPD. Cigarette smoke exposure reduces both the number and length of cilia,12 while goblet cell hyperplasia in COPD leads to more viscous mucus in the airways, further impeding proper ciliary motion.13 In mouse models, respiratory viruses themselves can induce mucus hypersecretion, contributing to the inability to clear the virus from the airway.14\n",

In a landmark 2002 study, Sethi et al. traced longitudinal sputum cultures in 81 moderate\u2010to\u2010severe COPD patients during both times of clinical stability and exacerbation.16 Interestingly, the acquisition of a new strain of bacteria (discovered through molecular typing) was highly associated with the development of an AECOPD. The relative risk of an exacerbation varied with each new species: 1.69 for H. influenzae, 1.77 for S. pneumoniae and 2.96 for M. catarrhalis. Since then, more sensitive quantitative PCR methods of identifying bacteria relative to standard culture methods have enabled better quantification and typing of bacterial strains during exacerbations. In one study, while species such as H. influenzae and S. pneumonia were identified in stable states, their relative loads, determined by PCR, were considerably higher during exacerbations (108 cfu/mL vs 107 cfu/mL for both species).17 The most prevalent species identified during exacerbation was S. pneumoniae, followed by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and Legionella pneumophila. In more severe COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) < 50% predicted), Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also frequently encountered as a cause of exacerbations (Table 1).24\nPseudomonas aeruginosa infections appear to portend a worse prognosis with higher 30\u2010 and 90\u2010day mortality rates compared with exacerbations not associated with this bacterium.25\n",

In an experimental rhinovirus infection, where COPD and control patients were nasally inoculated with low doses of rhinovirus, only COPD patients developed significant increases in sputum bacterial load post\u2010viral infection.40 While sputum viral loads peaked between days 5 and 9 post\u2010inoculation, bacterial loads peaked later around day 15, confirming that in these studies viral infection can promote bacterial superinfection. Subjects who ultimately developed secondary bacterial infections had lower baseline FEV1 compared with those who remained free from secondary infections. A plausible mechanism was suggested whereby rhinovirus infection induces neutrophil elastase (NE) production, which then degrades the antimicrobial peptides elafin and secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, both of which may be important in protecting subjects from bacterial infections.40 These data suggest that AECOPD events thought to be bacterially induced may in fact have been preceded by an initial viral infection.

However, the term colonization in this context may be debated, as the microorganisms identified in stable COPD are not necessarily benign. Collective evidence favours the vicious cycle hypothesis whereby an inciting event (e.g. smoking) leads to an impaired innate immune response and results in bacterial colonization.41 This in turn promotes airway and systemic inflammation leading to COPD progression. As airway inflammation persists despite smoking cessation, the presence of a persistent stimulus\u2014independent of cigarette smoke\u2014is consistent with a role for colonizing bacteria in the pathogenesis of COPD.42, 43\n",

In turn, the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways ensues, a feature characteristic of bacterially colonized COPD patients.45 Neutrophils are anti\u2010infective and have recently been found to have modulatory functions.46 In COPD, neutrophils are intrinsically altered with abnormal host defence functions and have unusual chemotactic behaviour and migratory structure.47 Activated neutrophils cause lung destruction and emphysematous change through the release of oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes, including NE that reduces ciliary function, induces epithelial damage and is a potent stimulator of mucin production.47 The resulting mucus production and impaired mucociliary clearance leads to further bacterial colonization and airway obstruction. Additionally, increased levels of airway inflammatory markers such as IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NE are found in stable COPD patients with bacterial colonization compared with those without bacterial colonization, strongly implicating the colonized state with a deleterious immune response.45, 47 Such persistent inflammation is associated with increased daily symptoms, exacerbations and mortality.48, 49 Defective phagocytosis is also characteristic of COPD particularly that of alveolar\u2010 and monocyte\u2010derived macrophages, which in turn likely contributes to chronic bacterial colonization and infective exacerbations.6 This is clearly evidenced by the observed impaired phagocytosis of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis with increasing COPD severity.50 In addition, alveolar macrophage surface receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and scavenger receptor (MARCO)) that respond to intracellular signalling and phagocytosis are seen to be diminished in both COPD and smokers.51, 52, 53 Chronic bacterial colonization also activates adaptive immune responses, with the development of B\u2010cell lymphoid follicles and production of mucosal IgA and serum IgG antibody including strain\u2010specific IgG antibody against bacterial colonizers, a phenomenon characteristic of the COPD airway.54 Increases in lymphoid follicles have been noted in the small airways of patients with severe COPD, possibly secondary to chronic airway infection.55 Thus, impaired innate immune responses likely contribute to microbial airway colonization while the activation of adaptive immunity suggests a state of heightened immune surveillance associated with lung function decline in established COPD.",

Both conditions share a number of common risk factors, including cigarette smoking and biomass fuel exposure. In addition, the spread of HIV has triggered not only a resurgence in TB rates, but also an accelerated form of COPD affecting HIV patients as early as in their 30s and 40s. Recent interest in the role of vitamin D in airway diseases and pulmonary infections has suggested that certain vitamin D\u2010binding protein polymorphisms may also predispose patients to both COPD and TB. Once contracted, TB may set the stage for future COPD by activating MMPs. Destruction of the extracellular matrix and caseous necrosis is critical to the formation of cavitary lesions by which TB can then propagate and aerosolize. At the same time, however, the upregulation of MMPs may also help to trigger emphysema, as multiple studies have shown an increase in MMP\u20101, \u20102, \u20108 and \u20109 in emphysematous lung tissue. The ensuing lung remodelling may result in significant airway disease. Conversely, COPD itself may promote subsequent TB infection by impairing immune responses and ciliary function, two key defences against pathogenic microbes. Innate immune dysregulation against pathogens such as H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae have been well documented in COPD; while similar work on TB has yet to be confirmed. The phagocytic disruption observed in COPD may indeed hold validity for TB as well. For instance, cigarette smoke\u2010exposed mice have been shown to demonstrate impaired macrophage responses to TB in comparison to control mice. These injuries may be in part mediated by chronic exposure to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs).",

Inhaled Aspergillus conidia bind to surface receptors within terminal airways via galactomannan, which enhance uptake by alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells leading to a cascade of immune responses.

Pulsed therapies of antibiotics are frequently used to control bacterial multiplication, which consequently promotes the development of antimicrobial resistance. Prolonged use of macrolides for the prophylaxis and treatment of COPD exacerbations has been shown to increase antimicrobial drug resistance in H. influenzae.184 The commonly used drug azithromycin has a long half\u2010life of around 66 h, which can lead to drug concentrations below the minimum inhibitory concentration for an extended period of time.185 This prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the drug may be one of the reasons behind the increased resistance to macrolides. Indeed, a study by Desai et al. on COPD patients with S. pneumoniae infection showed a correlation between exposure to macrolides and development of resistance.186 They advised for the use of alternative antibiotics in patients who have been taking macrolides in the previous 6 months.186 A 15\u2010year longitudinal study conducted by Pettigrew et al. concluded that fluoroquinolones represent the best choice for eradicating H. influenzae in COPD patients.184 In their study, none of the bacterial isolates developed resistance to fluoroquinolones.184 Even though P. aeruginosa is a relatively uncommon cause of COPD exacerbations, its incidence is on the rise and the rapid emergence and spread of MDR (defined by resistance to at least three antibiotic classes) is a serious cause for concern. A comparative study conducted in Spain has demonstrated that the carriage of MDR P. aeruginosa in COPD patients was associated with increased mortality rates and more recent work in AECOPD reveals a high burden of antibiotic resistance.25, 187 The lung environment found in COPD patients is also favourable to the formation of biofilms, a mechanism by which bacteria, particularly P. aeruginosa and H. influenza, evade antibiotic killing. In addition to limiting antimicrobial penetration, the biofilm triggers the emergence of relatively quiescent bacteria that become phenotypically drug resistant to most antibiotics, therefore increasing their persistence for prolonged periods of time.188 Currently, the most effective way of curbing antimicrobial resistance is to reduce the use of antibiotics by prescribing them only to patients with demonstrated pathological bacterial infection. In this respect, the use of sensitive markers of bacterial infection such as procalcitonin to guide the start of antibiotic therapy was shown to significantly reduce the use of antibiotics in COPD patients.189 There is also the potential that the new therapies developed for steroid\u2010resistant asthma may also be beneficial in COPD and possibly avoid the infection\u2010inducing effects of ICS.190\n",

Nevertheless, immune responses observed in stable and colonized COPD patients reflect the corollary of those seen in AECOPD supporting a role for microbial colonization in COPD pathogenesis most likely through a perpetuation of negative immune responses over time. Initial work has started to uncover changes in the lung microbiome associated with the COPD state and may reveal further variables to be considered in the investigation of microbe\u2013COPD interactions. The parallel use of mouse models and interrogation of human samples ex vivo and in primary cell culture will likely progress mechanistic insights and drug development. Importantly, however, other variables of microbiome composition may confound pathogen\u2010centric investigations of disease\u2013microbe interactions and it is likely that large\u2010scale studies will be required to address the current gaps in our knowledge of bacterial, viral and fungal microbiota and their association with COPD. Precipitous drops in the costs of DNA sequencing, coupled with the technological innovations in metagenomics, may soon bring such technology into the realm of routine diagnostics in COPD. This could allow for refined patient phenotyping and stratification that in turn will allow more focused and personalized therapy based on microbiology. Finally, the impact of antimicrobial therapy and the use of antibiotic prophylaxis on the respiratory microbiome provide further challenges. The extensive remodelling of the microbiome that occurs in response to COPD antibiotic treatment while recognized has unclear long\u2010term consequences for patients.",
