However, it was not until 1959 that the tripeptide glutathione (g-glutamylcysteinylglycine, GSH) was recognized as the source of the cysteinyl portion of mercapturates (Barnes et al., 1959; Bray et al., 1959) . GSH is found in almost all bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells in high concentration, typically 0.5-12 mmol l \u00c0 1 (Stevens and Jones, 1989; Taniguchi et al., 1989) . The mercapturate pathway begins with the formation of a thioether bond between GSH and a xenobiotic in a reaction catalyzed (or enhanced) by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Subsequently, the resulting glutathione S-conjugate is converted to a cysteinylglycine S-conjugate by g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and thence to a cysteine S-conjugate by various peptidases. Finally, the cysteine S-conjugate is N-acetylated to the corresponding N-acetyl-L-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturate is generally more water soluble than is the parent compound and is more readily excreted. (For reviews, see Chasseaud, 1976; Silbernagl and Heuner, 1993; Stevens and Jones, 1989.)

Phase I transformations serve to unmask a functional group and may involve reactions such as oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. Phase II transformations generate highly polar derivatives (conjugates), such as glucuronides and sulfate esters, which are excreted into the urine. Almost all these transformations are catalyzed by transferases (Cole and Deeley, 2006) . It was originally thought that phase II reactions complete the processes begun by phase I transformations. Others have suggested that elimination of the glutathione Fig. 1 The mercapturate pathway and associated side reactions. If the mercapturate precursor contains an electrophilic center, it may react directly with GSH (reaction 1). Alternatively, the precursor may be converted to a compound with an electrophilic center (reaction 2) prior to reaction with GSH. Reactions (1)-(5) represent the mercapturate pathway. Reactions (7)-(9) are alternative reactions for elimination of cysteine S-conjugates. Reactions (7) plus (8) denote the thiomethyl shunt. The thiomethyl compound (XSCH 3 ) may be excreted unchanged or further oxidized to sulfoxide, sulfone, or CO 2 and sulfate, which are excreted. For some cysteine S-conjugates, metabolism may also involve conversion to the a-keto acid, a-hydroxy acid, and oxidatively decarboxylated product (see \"Deamination and Transamination\" section). The cysteine S-conjugate may also be converted to the corresponding sulfoxide.

Moreover, glutathione S-conjugates are rarely excreted by the kidney because of their large size and amphiphilic character and the presence of GGT and dipeptidases in the proximal tubules. Glutathione S-conjugates are often excreted into the bile Marchand et al., 1988; Silverman, 1992) and/or further metabolized, especially to the mercapturate.

Recently, it has become apparent that GSTs have important roles, for example, in catalyzing addition of GS \u00c0 to cyst(e)ine residues resulting in protein glutathionylation (Menon and Board, 2013; Townsend et al., 2014) and in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (Tew and Townsend, 2012) . Many drugs and other xenobiotics or their metabolites are directly electrophilic and are thus capable of causing cellular damage in vivo. By intercepting these potentially harmful electrophiles, GSH is important in the defense against foreign substances. GSH is a \"soft\" nucleophile (i.e., the sulfur is of low electronegativity and high polarizability and is easily oxidized) and preferentially reacts with \"soft\" electrophiles (i.e., compounds that contain an acceptor atom with high polarizability, low electronegativity, and often unshared p or d valence electrons). Thus, reactions of GSH with electrophiles often proceed at a measurable rate in the absence of a catalyst (Koob and Dekant, 1991) , but in general, the reaction is accelerated by the action of GSTs. These enzymes are widespread in nature and are present in most mammalian tissues. In the mammalian liver, GSTs account for > 3-10% of the soluble protein (Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994) . The cytosolic forms are dimers with monomer M r of $ 25 \u00c2 10 3 . Many GST isozymes have been identified in the rat (Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994) . Cytosolic GSTs are now usually classified into several classes (A (alpha), M (mu), P (pi), T (theta), Z (zeta), O (omega), and S (sigma)) according to their isoelectric point, substrate and inhibitor properties, antibody recognition, and N-terminal amino acid sequences. GSTs may also be broadly classified on the basis of their cellular location, namely, microsomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic (Hayes et al., 2005) . The enzymes contain a binding site for GSH (nucleophile) and a separate binding site for hydrophobic compounds with electrophilic centers. GSTs are highly specific for GSH as the nucleophile but, depending on the isozyme, exhibit wide and overlapping substrate specificities with regard to the electrophilic substrate. Binding of GSH to the active site facilitates ionization to the nucleophilic thiolate anion (GS \u00c0 ) (Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994) . GSH conjugation can occur by three mechanisms (Anders, 2004 (Anders, , 2008 . For example, haloalkenes and dichloroacetylene undergo GST-catalyzed vinylic substitution (S N V) reactions that may be either a Michael addition reaction (e.g., with tetrafluoroethylene (F 2 C] CF 2 , Eq. 1) and dichloroacetylene (ClC^CCl, Eq. 2)) or an addition-elimination reaction (e.g., with trichloroethylene (Cl(H)C]CCl 2 , Eq. 3)). GSTs also catalyze reactions with epoxide moieties (e.g., in the conversion of leukotriene A 4 (LTA 4 ) to leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4 )). Glutathione S-conjugate formation with haloalkenes is catalyzed by both microsomal (MGST1) and cytosolic GSTs in ratios that depend to some extent on the structure of the haloalkene and references cited therein).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 407, "text": "Taniguchi et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF417"}, {"start": 581, "end": 604, "text": "(Menon and Board, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF302"}, {"start": 605, "end": 627, "text": "Townsend et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF431"}, {"start": 687, "end": 711, "text": "(Tew and Townsend, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF426"}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1414, "text": "(Koob and Dekant, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1674, "text": "(Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1828, "text": "(Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2248, "text": "(Hayes et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 2670, "end": 2706, "text": "(Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2768, "text": "(Anders, 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2769, "end": 2784, "text": "(Anders, , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Glutathione S-Transferases (GSTs)"}, {"text": "Interestingly, despite their generally broad specificity, many mammalian GSTs are able to catalyze stereoselective addition of GSH to some electrophiles (Balogh et al., 2008; Dohn et al., 1985; Livesey et al., 1982; Mangold and Abdel-Monem, 1980; Rosner et al., 1998) .

The highest level of GGT expression is on the surface of the renal proximal tubules. Secretory and absorptive epithelial cells in glands in the testes, endocervix, endometrium, adrenals, prostate, intestinal crypts, sweat glands, and salivary glands all express GGT. In the liver, GGT is localized to the bile canaliculi of hepatocytes and bile ducts. GGT is also expressed on the apical surface of pancreatic acinar cells, and activity can be detected in pancreatic juice and bile (Kristiansen et al., 2004) . Capillary endothelium in the brain and spinal cord also expresses GGT. GSH and glutathione S-conjugates present in fluids that flow through these ducts are metabolized by GGT. 10.17.2.2.5 Reactions catalyzed by GGT GGT catalyzes the cleavage of g-glutamyl bonds (Fig. 2) . A large number of g-glutamyl compounds in which the glutamate moiety is unrestricted except for the g-glutamyl bond are substrates for GGT. These include GSH, GSSG, glutathione S-conjugates, g-glutamyl amino acids, and g-glutamyl p-nitroanilide (a substrate commonly used to assay enzyme activity) Meister, 1963, 1970; Wickham et al., 2011) . The g-glutamyl group of the substrate is transiently bound to the enzyme, and the reaction proceeds through a modified ping-pong mechanism (Keillor et al., 2005) . The crystal structure of the human enzyme cocrystallized with glutamate showed that the a-carboxylate of the g-glutamyl moiety of the substrate is stabilized within the active site of the enzyme by forming hydrogen bonds with Arg-107, Ser 451, and Ser-452S (West et al., 2013b) . The a-amino group forms a salt bridge with Glu-420. Cleavage of the g-glutamyl bond of the substrate, the first step in the reaction, results in the formation of an acyl bond between the glutamate and the catalytic threonine of the enzyme with the release of all but the glutamate portion of the substrate. The glutamate is released from the enzyme when the enzyme/g-glutamyl complex reacts either with a water molecule, yielding glutamate and free enzyme, or with the a-amine of an acceptor molecule (transferase or transpeptidase reaction), yielding a g-glutamyl amino acid and free enzyme (Taniguchi and Ikeda, 1998) . The a-amine of a free amino acid or a dipeptide can serve as an acceptor for the g-glutamyl group (Thompson and Meister, 1977) . The enzyme is routinely assayed by the development of a yellow color upon the release of p-nitroaniline from g-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. The addition of an acceptor such as glycylglycine in a large excess (10-to 40-fold excess relative to the substrate concentration) accelerates the rate of the reaction (Thompson and Meister, 1977) .

The essential nature of this reaction was established with the development of GGT knockout strains of mouse (Lieberman et al., 1996) . GGT-null mice were born at expected ratios with no apparent phenotypic abnormalities. However, they excreted high levels of GSH in their urine, failed to grow at the same rate as their wild-type littermates, and died by 10 weeks of age from a cysteine deficiency. GGT-null mice can be rescued by supplementing them with N-acetyl cysteine. Earlier work with cultured cell lines had shown that expression of GGT enables cells to initiate the release of cysteine from extracellular GSH . GSH cannot be taken up intact by most cells. In the knockout mice, GSH present in the glomerular filtrate passes intact through the proximal tubules and is excreted into the urine (Lieberman et al., 1996) . In wild-type mice, GGT localized to the apical surface of the proximal tubules cleaves the g-glutamyl bond releasing glutamate and cysteinylglycine. The cysteinylglycine dipeptide can be cleaved into cysteine and glycine by any of several dipeptidases present on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells (\"Hydrolysis of Cysteinylglycine and Its Conjugates\" section). Cysteine can be synthesized from methionine or through a salvage pathway, but the knockout mice are not able to maintain an adequate supply of cysteine for growth and development while continuously excreting large amounts of GSH in the urine. The GGT knockout mouse becomes deficient only in cysteine, indicating that uptake of amino acids does not depend on GGT, as had been proposed by some investigators (Orlowski and Meister, 1970) . A physiological role for the transferase reaction has not been demonstrated.

Analysis of the kinetic activity of human GGT-rel demonstrated that it hydrolyzes the g-glutamyl bond of glutathione and glutathione conjugates . The K m of GGT-rel for the substrates, including GSH, GSSG, and LTC 4 , is similar to those exhibited by GGT, but the rate of the GGT-rel reaction is 37-fold slower than that exhibited by GGT, resulting in a second order rate kinetic for human GGT-rel that is 37-fold lower than for GGT . A study of LTC 4 metabolism in three patients deficient in GGT showed increased levels of LTC 4 but no detectible level of its metabolite LTD 4 (Mayatepek et al., 2004) .

They all possess the highly conserved HEXXH(X)18E zinc-binding and GAMEN motifs essential for enzyme activities (Luan et al., 2012) . APN is important in modulating the activity of several peptide hormones (Albiston et al., 2004; Luan and Xu, 2007) .

This selectivity has allowed Tate and coworkers to estimate that about 65%, 60%, and 95% of S-methyl-cysteinylglycine-hydrolyzing activities of the rat renal, jejunal, and epididymal membranes are due to cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (reviewed in Tate, 1989) .

Most of these studies have focused on uptake of DCVC across the basolateral (peritubular) membrane of the renal proximal cells. Wright et al. (1998) showed that DCVC is taken up by a Na \u00fe -dependent transport system in isolated renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Several neutral amino acids but especially phenylalanine, cysteine, and leucine compete with uptake of DCVC across the luminal membrane in this system (Wright et al., 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 305, "text": "(Kramer et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 408, "end": 429, "text": "(Hughey et al., 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 430, "end": 449, "text": "Jones et al., 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 541, "end": 568, "text": "(Curthoys and Hughey, 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 856, "end": 870, "text": "(Anders, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1080, "text": "Anders, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1103, "text": "Lash and Anders, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1135, "text": "Schaeffer and Stevens, 1987a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1286, "text": "Wright et al.

Previously, Dryhurst and coworkers established that the mercapturate of dopamine and 5-S-cysteinyldopamine are potent neurotoxins.

E. coli tryptophanase (a \"true\" physiologically relevant b-lyase) and a cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase in an extract of Eubacterium limosum were shown to catalyze b-elimination reactions with the cysteine S-conjugates of E-2-hexenal and 2-hexenol (Wakabayashi et al., 2004) . The cysteine S-conjugate b-lyases purified from Fusobacterium necrophorum and F. varium (Tomisawa et al., 1984) have been partially purified and characterized. The enzymes have M r values of 228 \u00c2 10 3 and 70 \u00c2 10 3 and require pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. The enzyme from F. necrophorum catalyzes the CeS cleavage of the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor, BTC, and 1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-cysteinylnaphthalene. The propachlor conjugate was shown to be converted to N-isopropylacetanilide, pyruvate, and ammonium ion. The enzyme from F. varium is most active with aromatic cysteine S-conjugates, but some activity is noted with simple alkyl conjugates. A highly purified cysteine Sconjugate b-lyase was obtained from E. limosum (Larsen and Bakke, 1983) . The enzyme has a M r of about 75 \u00c2 10 3 and is composed of two identical subunits. The enzyme is active with the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor, trans-9-hydroxy-10-(S-(L-cysteinyl))-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, BTC, and DCVC. It is also moderately active with the simple alkyl cysteine conjugate S-ethyl-L-cysteine. The enzyme does not require added PLP but is inhibited by carbonyl reagents suggesting the presence of a carbonyl-containing cofactor. Of interest is the finding that the enzyme is active with cystathionine, djenkolic acid, lanthionine, and cystine, suggesting that the enzyme is similar to PLP-dependent cystathionine band g-lyases. In contrast, the F. necrophorum and F. varium lyases do not exhibit activity with cystathionine. Bernstr\u00f6m et al. (1989) showed that rat fecal contents and the purified E. limosum enzyme catalyze the conversion of the cysteine S-conjugate LTE 4 to 5-hydroxy-6-mercapto-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid. Interestingly, the enzyme can catalyze the conversion of b-chloroalanine to pyruvate and ammonia, but it is not inactivated in the process. Many PLP-containing enzymes that catalyze this elimination reaction are syncatalytically inactivated by aminoacrylate intermediate(s) formed during the elimination reaction (\"Catalytic Mechanism of the Cysteine S-Conjugate b-Lyase Reaction and Syncatalytic Inactivation\" section). Finally, the E. limosum enzyme exhibits high activity with the S-oxide of propachlor (Larsen and Stevens, 1986) . Eliminated fragment is presumably a sulfenic acid [RS(O)H]. Gut bacteria are known to be important in catalyzing biotransformations of certain xenobiotics, including conjugate formation with GSH . The fact that cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase activity is widespread in enteric bacteria and that a major portion of cysteine S-conjugates are excreted into the bile suggests that the gut flora may be important for the incorporation of sulfur into some xenobiotics (Larsen and Stevens, 1986) . Moreover, it appears that the cysteine S-conjugate b-lyases of the enteric bacteria have different substrate specificities than do the mammalian enzymes. For example, the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor is a substrate for the enteric enzymes, but germ-free rats do not metabolize this compound . As noted earlier, certain sulfhydryl-containing fragments, such as that eliminated from DCVC, are exceptionally reactive and are likely to act locally. Whether cysteine S-conjugates, whose elimination products are very reactive, damage the gut and bile duct remains to be determined. Additionally, whether more stable thiol products generated from bacterial cysteine S-conjugates can be transported from the gut to other regions to exert toxic effects also remains to be evaluated (Larsen and Stevens, 1986) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 92, "end": 116, "text": "(Bernstr\u00f6m et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 117, "end": 140, "text": "Larsen and Bakke, 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 141, "end": 166, "text": "Larsen and Stevens, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}, {"start": 167, "end": 192, "text": "Saari and Schultze, 1965;", "ref_id": "BIBREF374"}, {"start": 193, "end": 213, "text": "Suzuki et al., 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF414"}, {"start": 214, "end": 236, "text": "Tomisawa et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF428"}, {"start": 237, "end": 262, "text": "Wakabayashi et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF462"}, {"start": 510, "end": 536, "text": "(Wakabayashi et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF462"}, {"start": 627, "end": 650, "text": "(Tomisawa et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF428"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1309, "text": "(Larsen and Bakke, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2083, "text": "Bernstr\u00f6m et al.

In general, the enzyme has a preference for L-glutamine, L-methionine (and many other sulfur-containing amino acids), L-phenylalanine (and some other aromatic amino acids), and the corresponding a-keto acids. As noted earlier, cysteine S-conjugates are also substrates of rat kidney GTK. Interestingly, L-selenocysteine Se-conjugates are more active aminotransferase and b-lyase substrates of rat kidney GTK than are the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates, in most cases by an order of magnitude or more (Commandeur et al., 2000) . As a consequence, GTK has been suggested to be a possible target for selenium-containing chemopreventive drugs (Commandeur et al., 2000) . L-Glutamine is the major amino acid substrate in vivo. The product of glutamine transamination (i.e., a-ketoglutaramate, aKGM) is rapidly removed by cyclization to a lactam and/or conversion to a-ketoglutarate in a reaction catalyzed by uamidase. Transamination is therefore \"pulled\" in the direction of glutamine utilization. Major roles of GTK are to close the methionine salvage pathway by transamination of KMB, to salvage the a-keto acid analogs of essential amino acids, and possibly to generate cyclic sulfur-containing imines (reviewed by Cooper, 2004; Pinto et al., 2014; Cooper et al., 2016) .

Toxicity of DCVC to kidney cells has been associated with (1) covalent modification of macromolecules, (2) depletion of nonprotein thiols (presumably mostly GSH), (3) lipid peroxidation (Beuter et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1990; Groves et al., 1991) , and (4) carbonylation of susceptible proteins (Fan et al., 2014) . These effects may be attributable to formation of metabolites derived from a b-lyase reaction since, as mentioned earlier, AOA can protect against DCVC toxicity in renal tissues and in renal cells in culture. Mechanisms by which metabolites of DCVC and other nephrotoxic haloalkene cysteine Sconjugates alter thiol status may involve direct inhibition of glutathione reductase (Lock and Schnellmann, 1990 ) and generation of oxidative stress that leads indirectly to oxidation of thiol compounds (Chen et al., 1990) . Oxidation of DCVC to DCVC sulfoxide followed by formation of a glutathione S-conjugate resulting from the reaction of DCVC sulfoxide with GSH may also lead to oxidative stress (Lash et al., 1994; Sausen and Elfarra, 1991) . Other studies lead us to suggest an additional possibility, namely, that oxidative stress may result in part from Michael addition of thiols to aminoacrylate generated in the b-lyase reaction. In experiments in which LLC-PK 1 cells were exposed to DCVC, the loss of nonprotein thiols was about 40-60% (Chen et al., 1990) . Interestingly, the authors suggested that depletion of nonprotein thiols to this extent was insufficient to kill the cells. As cited earlier, BTC is relatively nontoxic, despite the fact that it is metabolized in vivo via cysteine S-conjugate b-lyases (Elfarra and Hwang, 1990) . We are unaware of any studies on GSH status in renal cells/tissue resulting from exposure to BTC. Evidently, even if GSH is depleted in renal cells exposed to BTC, this insult may not be sufficient to induce overt toxicity. The implication of the work by Chen et al. (1990) is that in order for a cysteine S-conjugate to exhibit toxicity, it must generate reactive sulfur-containing fragments that covalently add to macromolecules. The toxicity may be enhanced, perhaps synergistically, by oxidative stress and by Michael adduction between aminoacrylate and susceptible nucleophiles such as GS \u00c0 and protein sulfhydryls and/or by modification of coenzyme in susceptible PLP enzymes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 103, "text": "Anders et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 104, "end": 122, "text": "Chen et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 123, "end": 143, "text": "Groves et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 144, "end": 166, "text": "Lash and Anders, 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF258"}, {"start": 502, "end": 523, "text": "(Beuter et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 524, "end": 542, "text": "Chen et al., 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 543, "end": 563, "text": "Groves et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 612, "end": 630, "text": "(Fan et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1037, "text": "(Lock and Schnellmann, 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1148, "text": "(Chen et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1346, "text": "(Lash et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1372, "text": "Sausen and Elfarra, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF377"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1695, "text": "(Chen et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1975, "text": "(Elfarra and Hwang, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2251, "text": "Chen et al.

How then can one explain the unusual susceptibility of the kidney to halogenated cysteine S-conjugates?

A major contributing factor is likely to be the very large surface area of the renal proximal tubules coupled to the extraordinary high renal vascular perfusion. In humans, the kidneys represent 0.4% of the body weight but receive 25% of the cardiac output (Pfaller and Gstraunthaler, 1998) ; the cortex receives 95% of the renal blood flow. Despite these factors, haloalkene cysteine S-conjugate-induced toxicity is not necessarily confined to renal tubules.

However, most of the activity is in the cytosolic fraction (Cooper and Meister, 1981) , and most of the b-lyase activity toward DCVC in rat kidney mitochondria could not be assigned to GTK (Abraham et al., 1995) .

The importance of mitAspAT as a cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase in the bioactivation of TFEC is underscored by the work of Bruschi et al. (1993) . These authors showed that six kidney mitochondrial proteins are thioacylated after rats are acutely administered a high dose of TFEC. No thioacylation of cytosolic kidney proteins was detected (negating an important role for cytosolic GTK in this process). The six proteins were identified as HSP60, mitHSP70, mitAspAT, aconitase, the E 2 k (dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase) enzyme component of the KGDHC, the E 3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) enzyme component of KGDHC, and the E 3 enzyme component of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKADHC) (Bruschi et al., , 1994 (Bruschi et al., , 1998 James et al., 2002) . Lock and Schnellmann (1990) had previously reported that metabolites of haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates (DCVC, TFEC, and PCBC) inhibited dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E 3 ). Our findings that mitAspAT catalyzes a cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase reaction with TFEC in vitro and is syncatalytically inactivated in the process (Cooper et al., 2002a) are consistent with the in vivo finding that this enzyme in the kidney is thioacylated after administration of TFEC to rats (Cooper et al., 2011) . We also showed that a high-M r cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase present in the kidney copurifies with HSP70 (Cooper et al., 2001) . As cited earlier, the high-M r cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase in rat kidney mitochondria contains mitAspAT.

Moreover, the specific activity of KGDHC, but not that of PDHC, is diminished in the kidneys of TFEC-treated rats (Bruschi et al., 1998) . We have found that KGDHC, but not PDHC, is directly inhibited in PC12 cells exposed to 1 mM TFEC (Park et al., 1999) . These findings are remarkable because E 3 is a common component of KGDHC, PDHC, and BCKADHC (and the glycine cleavage system). In the presence of TFEC and purified GTK (a source of thioacylating moieties), purified PDHC is more resistant to in vitro inactivation than is purified KGDHC (Park et al., 1999) . Moreover, there is some evidence that E 3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E 2 enzyme components in PDHC, whereas E 3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E 1 enzyme components in KGDHC (McCartney et al., 1998) . Thus, part of the resistance of PDHC to thioacylation/inactivation in kidney mitochondria of TFEC-treated rats may be due to differences in the arrangement of its constituent enzymes within the enzyme complex. In addition, PDHC is not known to be associated with any aminotransferases/b-lyases, whereas KGDHC is closely associated with mitAspAT.

Based on our findings (Cooper et al., 2002a (Cooper et al., , 2003 and those of Bruschi and coworkers (Bruschi et al., 1998; James et al., 2002) , we have proposed that not only are metabolites channeled through supramolecular complexes in the TCA cycle but toxicants are also channeled (Cooper et al., 2002b; Fig. 6 ). This concept explains not only the susceptibility of KGDHC to TFEC-induced inactivation in rat kidney and cells in culture but also the susceptibility of aconitase and BCKADHC to thioacylation/inactivation. Aconitase has Fig. 6 Model of toxicant channeling of b-lyase-derived TFEC products in mitochondria. TFEC is transported into the mitochondrion where it is converted by cysteine S-conjugate b-lyases to aminoacrylate (AMAC) and a reactive sulfur-containing fragment (RSH). AMAC not only is nonenzymatically converted to pyruvate and ammonium ion but also may react with PLP cofactor or susceptible protein residues. The three mitochondrial a-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (BCKADHC, KGDHC, and PDHC) are represented as multimeric units. Mitochondrial cysteine S-conjugate b-lyases include the homodimeric BCAT m and the homodimeric mitAspAT. The close juxtapositioning of BCAT m and mitAspAT to enzymes of energy metabolism results in channeling of toxicants to BCKADHC and to KGDHC/aconitase (Aco 2), respectively, resulting in their inactivation. PDHC is not known to be associated with any aminotransferase/cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase and is not directly inactivated.

This finding would explain the susceptibility of kidney BCKADHC to TFEC-induced inactivation. Although most of the studies in support of substrate channeling of TCA intermediates have utilized indirect methods, more recent physicochemical methods have provided more direct evidence for TCA substrate channeling (e.g., Wu and Minteer, 2015) .

The detection of the mercapturate in rats shows that the cysteine S-conjugate must have been generated in vivo either by direct reaction of busulfan with cysteine or via the glutathione S-conjugate. The cysteine S-conjugate of busulfan (b-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-L-alanine, THT-A) is unusual in that the sulfur is in the oxidation state of a sulfonium rather than a thioether.

Formation of THT is probably a detoxification event. However, the formation of aminoacrylate may be a bioactivation event if it leads to selected enzyme inactivation or removal of endogenous thiols. The formation of a GSH analog in which the cysteine of GSH is replaced by a dehydroalanine residue (g-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (EdAG); Fig. 8 , structure X) may also be a bioactivation Fig. 8 Proposed mechanism for the metabolic conversion of busulfan to THT. The strong electron-withdrawing properties of the eOS(O 2 )CH 3 group on busulfan (I) result in electron deficiency at each carbon adjacent to the two methanesulfonyl groups. This deficiency facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl of GSH at one of these carbons, resulting in elimination of methanesulfonate (II) and subsequent generation of adduct III. This step occurs nonenzymatically but is accelerated by GSTs. The electron deficiency in the remaining carbon adjacent to the eOS(O 2 )CH 3 group in adduct III facilitates nonenzymatic intramolecular nucleophilic attack at this carbon by a pair of electrons on the sulfur of the thioether, generating the glutathione S-conjugate (V) and eliminating a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. The conjugate (V) possesses a cyclic sulfonium group. GGT (a) and dipeptidases (b) possess broad specificities. Thus, V is expected to be readily converted to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate THT-A (VI). VI may also be formed by nonenzymatic nucleophilic attack of a cysteine sulfur on busulfan (I), which generates adduct IV and methanesulfonate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and elimination of a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. VI contains a strong electron-withdrawing group and is therefore expected to undergo a facile b-elimination reaction to yield THT (VII), ammonium ion (VIII), and pyruvate (IX). This reaction occurs nonenzymatically at pH 7.4 but is accelerated by PLP and by rat liver cystathionine g-lyase (and by other as yet unrecognized enzymes in rat tissues). THT (VII) may also be generated directly and nonenzymatically from g-E-THT-AG (V) by an elimination reaction that results in the formation of g-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (EdAG) (X). The conversion of busulfan (I) to the conjugate (V) is shown as occurring in two consecutive steps but may occur by a concerted mechanism. Note that the sulfur in THT is not derived from busulfan but rather from the sulfur of GSH. event. It is expected that Michael addition of sulfides across the double bond will occur. In this context, it has been shown that Michael addition of EdAG to GSH results in a GSSG analog in which the disulfide bond of GSSG is replaced by a stable, nonreducing ether bond ((2-amino-5-[[3-[2-[[4-amino-5-hydroxy-5-oxopentanoyl] amino]-3-(carboxymethylamino)-3-oxopropyl]sulfanyl-1-(carboxymethylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl]amino]-5-oxopentanoic acid); GSG) (Younis et al., 2008) . Thus, formation of EdAG may be deleterious by lowering GSH levels and/or interfering with enzymes that normally utilize GSH/GSSG. It has recently been shown that a reactive cysteine residue in the actives site of glutaredoxin 1 (or glutaredoxin 2) (Grx 1/2) reacts with EdAG to form an irreversible thioether (Scian and Atkins, 2015) . The enzyme is inactivated in the process. The authors suggested that the adduction of Grxs by EdAG suggests the possible alteration of proteins that are normally regulated via Grx-dependent reversible glutathionylation or deglutathionylation.

For example, glutathione S-conjugates of some hydroquinones and dihaloethanes may be directly toxic. In other cases, the cysteine S-conjugate derived from the glutathione S-conjugate may be toxic. For example, the cysteine S-conjugate of dopamine can form potentially highly toxic benzothiazines. In other cases, the sulfur of the thioether linkages of the S-conjugates of the mercapturate pathway may be oxidized to sulfoxides that are more toxic than the corresponding thioethers. For example, DCVC sulfoxide may be more toxic than DCVC. The potential exists for the cysteine S-conjugate sulfoxide to undergo an elimination reaction to generate a reactive sulfenic acid. However, there is no evidence that this occurs in the case of DCVC sulfoxide.

If the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is not especially reactive, the parent cysteine S-conjugate may not be particularly toxic (although some limited toxicity may be associated with the elimination product aminoacrylate). The sulfur-containing fragment may be thiomethylated or S-glucuronidated and excreted. Alternatively, the fragment may be further oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone before excretion. On the other hand, if the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is chemically reactive (e.g., by covalently reacting with macromolecules), the parent cysteine S-conjugate may be toxic, especially to the kidneys. Electrophiles that are bioactivated by this mechanism include halogenated alkenes and drugs such as methazolamide and cisplatin. Some PCBS and aminophenols may also be metabolized in part by pathways involving cysteine S-conjugate b-lyases. However, the contribution of the b-lyase reaction to the toxicity of these compounds is not clear. Mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism (KGDHC, aconitase) are especially vulnerable to reactive fragments generated from toxic halogenated, cysteine S-conjugates, by a process that has been termed toxicant channeling.
