Internally, the virus particle consists of an additional protein known as the nucleoprotein (N), which binds to the virus RNA in a helical structure similar to a beaded string, thereby protecting the RNA from degradation (Fig. 1\nA).8\n",

According to reports, the patients who died of this infection had a mean age of 56 years, and most had other diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, etc.), which could have made them more vulnerable to the virus. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 1 to 2 men were infected for every woman.

According to imaging tests, 75% of these patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14% showed significant mottling and ground-glass opacity, and 1% had pneumothorax. Similarly, 17% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, of whom 11% worsened in a short period and died due to multiple organ failure.23, 28 Moreover, the leukocyte counts were below the normal range in 9 of the patients and above the normal range in 24; 38% of them had above normal neutrophil counts. The lymphocyte and hemoglobin counts were below the normal range for many of the patients, and the platelet counts were below the normal range in 12% of the patients and above normal in 4%. Forty-three of these patients had varying degrees of impaired hepatic function, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels above the normal range.

A probable case involves a patient whose 2019-nCoV tests are not conclusive or are positive using an assay for coronavirus, but no laboratory evidence of other respiratory pathogens.
