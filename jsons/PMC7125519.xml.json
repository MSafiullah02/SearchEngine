The primary infection is usually followed by a life-long latency of the virus and its reactivation usually occurs during immunosuppression of the host. Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella (chickenpox) which usually takes a mild course in children but may be more severe in adults. Later on, after establishing latency in neural tissues, the virus can reactivate causing herpes zoster (shingles) which is often accompanied by neuralgic pain and can lead to post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) as well as other complications such as loss of vision (zoster ophthalmicus) [1], [2].",

However, reactivation of the virus is of significant concern in immunocompromised individuals, e.g. recipients of solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant, patients under aggressive chemotherapy or individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Under these circumstances, efficient antiviral drugs are of crucial importance. Effective treatments of herpesviridae species, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), VZV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [3], [4] are available but they are hampered by emergence of drug resistance and significant drug toxicities for some anti-herpesvirus agents (such as ganciclovir, foscavir and cidofovir). Four compounds are currently licensed for the treatment of VZV infections, namely acyclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir and brivudin [5], [6]. Regrettably, AIDS patients often do not respond well to acyclovir therapy or other antiviral drugs due to the emergence of thymidine kinase-deficient or thymidine kinase-altered mutations of VZV [7], [8]. Therefore, the extensive search for new anti-VZV agents with superior efficacy compared to currently approved drugs is of high importance.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the antiviral activity of several 1,3-disubstituted quinazoline-2,4-diones (Fig. 2\n) has been discovered in recent years [19]. A 3-benzylquinazolin-2,4-dione derivative 1 was reported to posses the anti-HIV-1 activity in MT-4 cells and inhibited the recombinant RT in vitro [20]. A quinazolinone-2,4-dione 2 was a potent inhibitor of RSV-induced cytopathic effect (EC50 = 2.14 \u03bcM) [21]. Several other analogues, namely 3\u20135, proved to be very active toward Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) [21]. Recently, the N3-benzoylquinazolinonedione moiety was successfully incorporated as a nucleobase mimetic into the 1,2,3-triazole analogues of nucleotides 6\n[22] and 7\n[23]. While the compound 6 showed a moderate activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) (EC50 = 17 \u03bcM) as well as feline herpes virus (EC50 = 24 \u03bcM), its dihydroxylated derivative (1R,2S)-7 proved to be even more potent (EC50 = 2.9, 4 and 4 \u03bcM toward HSV-1, HSV-2 and feline herpes virus, respectively), while the enantiomer (1S,2S)-16 was inactive [23]. From several functionalized quinazoline-2,4-diones studied as allosteric inhibitors of the NS5B polymerase compounds 8\u201310 exhibited the highest affinity to the enzyme [24]. On the basis of these observations one may conclude that for the antiviral activity of quinazoline-2,4-diones substitution at N3 with aryl, benzyl or benzoyl groups is beneficial.",

The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. Cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.",
