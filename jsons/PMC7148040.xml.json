Typical examples describe diseases that are associated with mechanisms that originate phenotypic abnormalities as a result of modified gene expression, as well as the action of drugs on those diseases [4], among others. One significant step to fully understand biological systems mechanisms is to extract and classify the relations that exist between the different biomedical entities, namely chemicals, diseases, genes, and phenotypes. In literature, authors classify this problem as a Relation Extraction (RE) task. Biomedical RE aims to extract and classify relations between biomedical entities in highly heterogeneous or unstructured scientific or clinical text.",

Word embeddings can learn how to detect relations between entities but manifest difficulties in grasping the semantics of each entity and their specific domain. Domain-specific ontologies provide and formalize this knowledge. Thus, a structured representation of the semantics between entities and their relations, an ontology, allows us to use it as an added feature to a machine learning classifier. Some of the biomedical entities structured in publicly available ontologies are genes properties/attributes (Gene Ontology (GO)) (45003 terms) [1, 23], phenotypes (Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)) (25810 terms) [12], diseases (Human Disease Ontology (DO)) (18114 terms) [21], and drugs/chemicals (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)) (133104 terms) [8]1.",

            "text": "External sources of knowledge, such as biomedical ontologies, can provide highly valuable information for the detection of relations between entities in the text, as described previously by Lamurias et al. [13]. These knowledge-bases provide not only relevant characteristics about the respective entities but also about the underlying semantics of the relations they establish. This information is not expressed directly in the training data but usually reinforces a relation between two entities in the text. The novelty of our system is that expands the previous work done by Lamurias et al. [13] by using four types of domain-specific ontologies, and combine them to extract new types of relations, along with word embeddings [19] and WordNet hypernyms [5]. BiOnt successfully replicates the results of the BO-LSTM application, using different types of ontologies. Our system can extract new relations between four biomedical entities, namely, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and chemicals. Figure 1 shows how these four types of biomedical ontologies can be combined to aid the relation extraction of ten different combinations of biomedical entities. The BiOnt system also explores the use of entities that are not direct entries in an ontology (e.g., genes), linking each entity to their most informative annotation concept within a corresponding ontology (e.g., GO). Our method incorporates more ontologies than the previously mentioned systems and is evaluated using three state-of-the-art data sets. The BiOnt system can be used to effectively populate knowledge bases regarding gold standard relations. Ultimately, it can be used to explore new experimental hypotheses providing evidence to researchers and clinicians about possible unknown associations between biomedical entities.\n",

The input data is used to generate instances to be classified by the model. Each instance corresponds to a candidate pair of entities in a sentence. To each instance, the model assigns a positive or negative class. A positive class corresponds to an identified relation between two biomedical concepts, where the nature of this relation depends of the data set being used to perform the evaluation, and a negative class implies no relation between the different entities.",

After sentence tokenization, these layers are: Shortest Dependency Path (SDP) [18, 20], WordNet Classes [5], and Ontology Embeddings. The latter represents the relations between the ancestors for each ontology concept corresponding to an entity (Fig. 2). The model assumes that the input data already has the offsets of the relevant entities identified and their respective concept ID, the Named-Entity Recognition and Linking tasks. However, while most entities already corresponded to an ontology concept ID, some entities, such as genes do not have a direct entry in an ontology. BiOnt matches these entities to their most representative concept in the Gene Ontology [1]. To match the gene to their most representative GO term the priority was given to concepts inferred from experiments, for having a more sustained background and usually be more descriptive. For tie-breaking, if we have several GO terms inferred from experiments, the choice is the term that is the most specific (i.e., with the longer ancestry line).\n",

The differences in F-score, for the distinct data sets, are mostly due to how they were built, and the completeness and complexity of the respective ontologies. For instance, the PGR corpus is a silver standard corpus, therefore, could have entities that were poorly identified, not identified at all, or not linked to the right identifier.
