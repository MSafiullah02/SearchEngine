While waiting for effective vaccines, an epidemiological survey could show if a non\u2010infected cohort had been prescribed chloroquine (CQ) for malaria. CQ\u2010resistant malaria predominates, but CQ is sometimes given with proguanil. The hypothesis that CQ might afford Ebola prophylaxis comes from our own work showing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.2 HCQ also inhibits the replication of HIV in vitro.3\n",

Also, viral loads were far lower if HIV subjects were taking CQ, and the HIV infected children on concurrent CQ were well and lived longer.4, 5\n",

Ebola infects dendritic cells, which display signals of infection on their surfaces to activate T lymphocytes that destroy other infected cells before the virus replicates further. Defective dendritic cells fail to give the right signal to T\u2010cells to limit infection. Ebola works in part by inhibiting interferon: an Ebola protein, VP24, binds to and blocks a transport protein on the surface of immune cells that plays an important role in the interferon pathway.6\n",
