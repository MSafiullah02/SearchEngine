            "text": "Neurotropic viruses have become an invaluable tool for neuroscientists in their quest to elucidate the architecture of neuronal networks (Callaway, 2008, Taber et al., 2005, Ugolini, 1995, Ugolini, 2010). Compared to conventional methods of neurotracing, viruses offer the advantage of self-amplification, which ensures equally strong labeling of each cell as the virus passes from one neuron to the next. In addition, viral tracers allow a more specific targeting of cell types. Although numerous neurotropic viruses are known, mostly rabies virus (RABV) and several members of the alphaherpesvirus family have been employed for neuronal tracer studies to date. RABV is particularly suited for this purpose because it is transported in a strictly transsynaptical way with very little spread to nonneuronal cells, at least at early times of the infection. In addition, RABV exhibits exceptionally low cytopathogenicity in infected neurons. In both respects, RABV is on par with or even superior to alphaherpesviruses, including the PRV Bharta isolate. RABV does, however, also have disadvantages compared to herpesviruses. Unlike PRV, RABV is pathogenic to humans and therefore necessitates special safety measures. Also, as RABV is an RNA virus with a strictly cytoplasmic replication cycle, it does not permit the use of cell type-specific promoters to limit marker gene expression to certain cell types. Notwithstanding those limitations, RABV has gained increasing popularity as a tool for neuronal circuit analysis. Here, we present an overview of studies that have employed recombinant and nonrecombinant RABV as neuronal tracers highlighting the technical advancements that have been made in recent years.",

            "text": "Early studies of RABV spread in the central nervous system (CNS) have utilized fixed and street viruses in different animal models mainly to study the basis for differences in viral pathogenesis (Coulon et al., 1989, Gillet et al., 1986, Kucera et al., 1985, Lafay et al., 1991, Smart and Charlton, 1992, Tsiang et al., 1983). These studies clearly showed the strong tropism of RABV for neuronal cells. They also revealed that different types of neurons are not equally infected. Refractiveness to infection is in part explained by the strength of innervation and receptor density at the presynaptic membrane. Marked differences in cell tropism were observed not only between the pathogenic and attenuated mutant strains of CVS but also between pathogenic street and fixed viruses. These data strongly suggest the preferential use of different receptors by different RABV strains. In fact, several receptors have been reported in the literature, but their relative importance is unclear (Coulon et al., 1998, Jacotot et al., 1999, Lentz et al., 1983, Superti et al., 1986, Thoulouze et al., 1998, Tuffereau et al., 1998). Whether the absence of one or several of these receptors from certain types of neurons renders them refractive to infection by RABV remains to be determined.",

These studies noted the exceptional low cytotoxicity of RABV, the strict time-dependence of viral spread to higher order neurons, and the limited spread to nonneuronal cells. Kelly and Strick also carried out a rigorous comparison of different RABV strains, which revealed significant differences in the kinetics of viral spread. The pioneering work carried out by Ugolini and Kelly laid the groundwork for a large number of similar studies that mostly employed CVS-11 alone or in combination with conventional tracers to elucidate the architecture of different neural circuits in monkeys, rats, guinea pigs, and cats (Buttner-Ennever et al., 2002, Clower et al., 2005, Graf et al., 2002, Hashimoto et al., 2010, Hoshi et al., 2005, Iwata et al., 2011, Kelly and Strick, 2003, Kelly and Strick, 2004, Lois et al., 2009, Morcuende et al., 2002, Nassi and Callaway, 2006, Prevosto et al., 2009, Rathelot and Strick, 2006, Rice et al., 2009, Rice et al., 2010, Ugolini et al., 2006, Viemari et al., 2004a, Viemari et al., 2004b).",

However, at least one study has highlighted some variability in both parameters (Ruigrok et al., 2008). The reasons for this variability are not clear, but genetic variability of outbred animals and differences in the early innate and T-independent humoral immune responses among individual animals could play a role. Also, it should not be forgotten that RABV has an inherently higher spontaneous mutation rate and genetic variability than DNA viruses. This and the ability to form defective interfering particles if passaged at high multiplicity of infection (MOI) could easily result in phenotypic changes from the original virus isolate depending on the passage history of the particular virus stock in use. It will probably not be possible to completely eliminate the temporal dispersion in viral spread particularly once the virus has spread to higher order neurons, but it is generally advisable to use infectious doses as high as possible to synchronize timing of the infection and, therefore, increase reproducibility.",

            "text": "While attenuated strains of RABV are less suitable for neuronal tracer studies that require spread of RABV from peripheral nerve endings to higher order neurons in the CNS, they have proven quite useful for a different kind of neuronal tracer approach that aims to limit viral spread to monosynaptically connected neurons (Larsen et al., 2007, Wickersham et al., 2007a, Wickersham et al., 2007b). This was achieved by deleting the glycoprotein (G) gene from a recombinant clone of the SAD-B19 strain. In addition, the virus was engineered to express GFP. Deletion of the RABV G prevents spread of the virus beyond initially infected cells, while insertion of the GFP gene ensures strong labeling of cell bodies, dendrites, and axons which obviates the need for histochemical staining methods to outline the infected neurons (Wickersham et al., 2007a). In essence, this method prevents transsynaptic spread and limits labeling to first-order neurons. Wickersham and Wall then took this approach further and devised an ingenious strategy for targeting the initial infection in a cell-specific manner and limiting viral spread to monosynaptically connected neurons. Cell specificity was achieved by pseudotyping RABV with an avian virus glycoprotein and transfecting target neurons with an expression plasmid for the avian receptor protein TVA. To accomplish monosynaptic spread, the target cells also received an expression plasmid encoding the RABV G. The validity of the approach was first demonstrated ex vivo in brain slices transfected with the transcomplementing expression plasmids. In a further improvement of cell-specific targeting a recombinant AAV helper virus was used to express RABV G and TVA in a cre-dependent manner, which now opens a whole new avenue for targeting RABV infection to selected cell types by utilizing Cre-expressing transgenic mice (Wall et al., 2010). This strategy holds great promise for labeling monosynaptic circuits in the mouse model. Unfortunately, such genome engineering approaches are only applicable to small mammals, as genome engineering of primates is impractical due to their long gestation period and high reproductive age.",

Beta-galactosidase (\u03b2-Gal) and GFP were then inserted between the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes to generate two different marker viruses, which were utilized to detect neurons that project to two separate regions in the rat brain. Another elegant study utilized the monosynaptically restricted G-deleted viruses developed by the Callaway laboratory to double label premotor spinal interneurons after bilateral injection of two different marker viruses into the quadriceps muscles of newborn mice (Stepien et al., 2010). As in other studies, little neurodegeneration was observed in infected neurons until 12 days postinfection.

Several factors will have to be considered in these endeavors. The four main features that qualify RABV for neuronal tracer studies are its strong neurotropism, low cytopathogenicity, ability to invade the CNS from the periphery, and wide host range. Neurotropism of RABV is largely determined by the glycoprotein and its receptor specificity (Morimoto et al., 2000). The fact that rabies appears to utilize different cellular receptors and the marked differences in viral spread between different viral strains suggest that the specificity of neuronal labeling can be modified to some extent by constructing recombinant RABVs that express different glycoprotein genes. It is to be expected that this kind of approach will receive a significant boost once the three-dimensional structure of RABV G has been elucidated.",

This has been amply exploited for the expression of foreign antigens and marker genes like GFP and beta-galactosidase. Foreign genes up to 6.5 kb have been successfully inserted into the RABV genome (McGettigan et al., 2003a). The maximum coding capacity of RABV is likely considerably higher as the structure of the viral particle does not appear to pose a significant constraint on the size of foreign genes. Additional transcription cassettes can be placed at different positions, but they will affect genome replication and viral fitness to varying degrees. Insertions between N and P, for example, inhibit viral replication to a larger extent than insertions between G and L, and RABV does not tolerate the insertion of an additional transcription cassette upstream of the N gene. The positioning of foreign genes will also affect their expression level since there is a gradual decrease in transcription level from the N to the L gene (Schnell et al., 2010). For the purpose of neuronal tracer studies, it is probably best to insert additional genes at more downstream positions where they exhibit less of an inhibiting effect on replication. Studies with recombinant variants of N2c (Wirblich and Schnell, 2011), which is characterized by a lower transcription level than attenuated viral strains, show that marker genes placed between G and L are sufficiently amplified to be readily detectable in neuronal cells (Wirblich and Schnell, unpublished). In any case, the effects of gene insertions on viral replication will have to be assessed in detailed time-course experiments for each virus. This is particularly the case if the viruses are to be employed in dual tracing experiments where the window for successful superinfection of neurons with two different viruses is potentially rather short (Ohara et al., 2009a, Ohara et al., 2009b).",

However, the situation is different for the use in animals, especially for vaccination of wildlife. This is because killed virus administered in bait to wild wandering animals would be ineffective. However, orally administered, live-attenuated forms of RABV such as ERA, SAD-B19, SAG-1, and SAG-2 have been used widely in wildlife (more than 85 million doses) and have been successful at nearly eradiating RABV in Western Europe (Anonymous, 2006, Grimm, 2002). Despite their proven efficacy, replication-competent viruses retain the risk of reverting and causing disease (Faber et al., 2005b). As such, research has focused on improving the safety of these vaccines even more while not compromising on their efficacy (see below). This has led to the development of novel vaccines for rabies in wildlife.",

Despite the general success with conventional modified live viruses used to immunize against RABV, these vaccines were not as immunogenic in skunks and dogs. As such, further customized RABV vaccine constructs expressing G from different fixed and street strains of RABV were constructed and tested. Maximum protection in mice was achieved after vaccination with RABV expressing an identical RABV G (Morimoto et al., 2001). Stemming from this, the findings gave credence for vaccine design custom made for groups of wildlife that do not respond to mainstream vaccines.",

            "text": "Expression of multiple copies of RABV G has led to enhanced immunogenicity and viral attenuation. Neuronal cell lines and primary neurons infected with RABV expressing multiple G proteins showed evidence of increased apoptosis (Faber et al., 2002). Immunogenicity studies with the same constructs resulted in higher antibody titers against RABV G and RABV N. Insertion of triple RABV G was shown to further attenuate the vaccine construct rendering the virus completely apathogenic when injected directly into the brains of immunocompromised and immune-sufficient mice (Faber et al., 2009). RABV expressing triple G protected 5- and 10-day-old mice from intracranial (i.c.) challenge with a lethal RABV infection that killed 100% unvaccinated mice. Immune analysis showed induction of high VNA titers in these mice 21 days postimmunization. Further, postexposure immunization by RABV expressing triple G administered intracranially prevented lethal rabies encephalitis. Of note, the mechanism for viral attenuation secondary to expression of multiple G is not completely understood, and the presented data for the RABV expressing triple G actually showed that the G protein levels were less in the triple G construct compared to the control RABV at 24 h. However, there has to be some effect of the G protein expression levels on pathogenicity because the control virus (which encodes three G genes but only one with a functional start codon) was nearly as pathogenic as the construct containing only one G. Of note, if higher G expression levels are indeed responsible for the observed RABV attenuation, codon optimization (Wirblich and Schnell, 2011) might be a better approach to increase G levels. This is based on the fact that a single point mutation deleting the start codon of one or two G would result in virus with similar pathogenicity as the parental virus (Faber et al., 2009). However, caution is advised for strategies that are based solely on changes on the expression level of RABV G protein because changes in codon usage (and the resulting changes in G expression levels) do not suffice to render a pathogenic RABV apathogenic (Wirblich and Schnell, 2011).",

            "text": "Another practical way to improve on live RABV constructs is introduction of specific mutations, including those that abolish neurotropism of RABV (Dietzschold et al., 1983). As mentioned above, RABV G determines the tropism of the virus, albeit the spectrum of specific receptors absolutely necessary for infection remains elusive. Mutation of RABV G at position 333, replacing arginine with glutamic acid, attenuated the virus upon i.c. administration (McGettigan et al., 2003b). In addition, random mutations occurring at position 194 of G exchanging asparagine to lysine increased the pathogenicity of the attenuated RABV construct containing the 333 mutation (Faber et al., 2005b). This random mutation provided another residue that has been an excellent target for attenuation of RABV vaccine constructs (Faber et al., 2005b). An alternative approach tested by Mebatsion et al. showed that deletion of the conserved dynein light chain 8 (LC8)-binding motif in the RABV P in combination with the RABV G 333 mutation attenuated RABV 30-fold compared to the 333-mutation only RABV when administered in suckling mice (Mebatsion, 2001). Tan et al. (2007) confirmed these findings and showed that the deletion of LC8-binding motif in RABV P affects primary transcription of RABV. From these findings, the issue of custom made vaccines and the ability to use this mutation in conjunction with other mutations in specific strains of virus could be used to improve on the safety profile of these vaccines. Site-directed mutagenesis is an excellent method but based only on a very limited number of mutations (single or dual nucleotides) compared to wild-type RABV G; therefore, revertants are possible.",

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha, granulocyte macrophage cell stimulating factor, RANTES, and IP-10 have been expressed in RABV vectors and their pathogenicity and immunogenicity followed. This is a modern and intriguing approach that has shown an increase in immunogenicity by manipulating arms of the innate and adaptive immune systems (Faber et al., 2005a, Zhao et al., 2009, Zhao et al., 2010). Nevertheless, it also raises concerns about its application: cytokines/chemokines are species specific and the risk of their use in humans and animals is largely unknown, including toxicity and potential to trigger autoimmunity. RABV overexpressing RANTES or IP-10, for example, has been shown to increase the pathogenicity of RABV due to excessive inflammatory cells in the CNS (Zhao et al., 2009).

In this study, RABV was engineered to express HIV-1 gp160 envelope protein from either laboratory adapted (NL4-3) or dual-tropic isolate HIV-1 (89.6) (Schnell et al., 2000). This recombinant virus was recovered on BHK cells, and the functionality of the foreign envelope protein was confirmed by a fusion assay in human T cell line, Sup-T1. Immunogenicity was evaluated by monitoring envelope-specific antibody responses in mice inoculated by footpad injection and left either unboosted or boosted with a recombinant gp120/gp41 protein. Only boosted mice seroconverted, and the recombinant virus expressing NL4-3 induced HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. This demonstrated that RABV can efficiently prime B cells for robust humoral responses. A subsequent study showed that priming alone with these vectors could also induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which are cross-reactive to heterologous HIV-1 envelope proteins (McGettigan et al., 2001a). Together these studies clearly demonstrated the potential RABV vectors have in eliciting a balanced humoral and cellular HIV-1-specific immune response.",

In vivo immunogenicity studies demonstrated that the RABV HIV-1 Gag vector induced Gag-specific CD8+ T cells with MHC class I:Gag-specific T cell receptors, CTL activity, and IFN-\u03b3-secretion (McGettigan et al., 2001b).",

For this approach, RABV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag were engineered to include either the R333E mutation or a deletion of 43 amino acids of the RABV G cytoplasmic domain, or a combination of both (McGettigan et al., 2003b). The engineered viruses were apathogenic following intracranial challenge in mice compared to the parental strain. Moreover, the Gag-specific cellular immune responses were not decreased by these changes to RABV G (McGettigan et al., 2003b). These immunogenicity studies were encouraging and, as such, the 333 mutation was introduced and tested in a RABV vector-encoding HIV-1 Pr160 (Gag\u2013Pol precursor) and HIV-1 Env genes. Of note, this vector sustained replicative capacity and Gag-specific immunogenicity after a 55% increase in genome size over wild type (McGettigan et al., 2003a).",

            "text": "Vaccine research has also extended to the identification of adjuvants that can further improve or change the phenotype of the immune response to one that can deal with the target pathogen. In HIV vaccine research, live viral vectors have been manipulated to express inflammatory cytokines at the time of viral replication as a way to enhance the immune response. RABV vaccine studies have included IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b2 as vaccine adjuvants (McGettigan et al., 2006). Both IL-4 and IL-2 can induce a Th2 response; in addition, IL-2 can stimulate proliferation of both T cells and B cells and, in general, stimulates a Th1 response. IFN-\u03b2, however, is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is thought to skew the response to Th1 and may influence the expansion of CD8 T cells (Faul et al., 2008). RABV vaccine vector coexpressing HIV-1 Gag or Env and either murine IL-2 or IL-4 when tested in mice were highly attenuated. IL-4 expression reduced the cellular immune response to both Gag and Env, but did not significantly improve the humoral response. IL-2, however, did not reduce the cellular immune response but significantly improved the anti-Env humoral immune responses (McGettigan et al., 2006). More recently, it was shown that RABV expressing HIV-1 Gag and IFN-\u03b2 was less pathogenic than controls. IFN-\u03b2 expression resulted in 100-fold lower viral replication in vivo compared to controls. Even with lower viral replication, IFN-\u03b2 expression seemed to increase the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells during the primary response (Faul et al., 2008, Faul et al., 2009a, Faul et al., 2009b).",

For this approach, RABV backbone plasmids containing the R333E mutation or whose RABV G ectodomain was replaced with that of VSV were used to construct recombinant RABV expressing SIV Env and Gag or Gag\u2013Pol proteins (Faul et al., 2009a, Faul et al., 2009b, McKenna et al., 2007). These constructs allowed for a heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimen, an approach previously shown to increase the cellular response by about 4.5- to 5.5-fold higher than a prime-only approach (Tan et al., 2005). In two independent monkey studies, rhesus macaques were primed and boosted with RABV constructs (SIVmac239Gag, SIVSHIV89.6Env) (McKenna et al., 2007) or (SIVmac239Gag\u2013Pol and SIVmac239Env) (Faul et al., 2009a, Faul et al., 2009b, McKenna et al., 2007) and challenged with either SHIV-89.6 or the highly pathogenic SIVmac251, respectively (Faul et al., 2009a, Faul et al., 2009b, McKenna et al., 2007). Compared to vector controls, the vaccine groups seroconverted with induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cells and the vaccines were protected from an AIDS-like disease. Specifically, the protection against the highly pathogenic SIVmac251 strain combined with the lack of any vector-induced pathogenicity indicates great promise for RABV-based vectors as HIV-1 vaccines.",

Most of these cases are chronically infected and 20% develop severe liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A major obstacle in the treatment and control of HCV lies in the error-prone replicative machinery, which increases the genetic variability of HCV within an individual, resulting in quasispecies. Antiviral therapies have helped manage the disease; however, they have several disadvantages, including a low rate of response and toxicity. Similar to HIV, the correlates of protection against HCV are not well understood. There is, however, an appreciation of the need to induce neutralizing antibodies (nAb) and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to multiple HCV antigens. However, for the humoral response, it remains largely unknown which epitopes are important for nAb to target leading to sterilizing immunity (Tellinghuisen et al., 2007, von Hahn et al., 2007).",

Even highly attenuated RABV can be lethal following intracranial inoculation, at least in the immunodeficient host. In order to address such safety concerns, viruses have been further attenuated by complete genome deletion of an essential gene(s) that renders the vector unable to complete its viral life cycle. This attenuation strategy has been used on many viral backbones: adenovirus (Ad), vaccinia virus (VV), canarypox virus (CPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), VSV, and RABV (Bozac et al., 2006, Cenna et al., 2008, Cenna et al., 2009, Coulibaly et al., 2005, Gomme et al., 2010, Peng et al., 2005, Publicover et al., 2005, Russell et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Deleting RABV genes P or M generated replication-deficient RABV (Cenna et al., 2008, Cenna et al., 2009), so termed because they lack viral components that are required for a complete viral life cycle. RABV P is a phosphoprotein cofactor to the viral RNA polymerase, and its deletion severely hinders intracellular replication (Cenna et al., 2009). However, due to the role of M in assembly and budding, M-deleted virus is structurally impaired forming mainly cell-associated rod-shaped particles instead of the typical bullet-shaped particles. M also has a role in regulating the balance between transcription and replication, and as such, M-deleted virus may be impaired at the level of viral replication. These effects on virion formation reduce infectious titers as much as 500,000-fold (Mebatsion et al., 1999). In addition, deletion of P and M may have additional, unknown effects on viral fitness that contribute to their immunogenicity. McGettigan et al. generated a P-deleted replication-deficient RABV for potential use in pre- or postexposure vaccine regimens for prevention of human rabies infections (Cenna et al., 2008). A likely candidate would induce IgG2a antibodies for their potent antiviral effector functions. Current regimens use inactivated RABV particles that require several doses to be effective. In a head-to-head comparison of live P-deleted RABV and inactivated RABV, they found mice immunized with P-deleted had 10-fold greater survival and a proportionately greater IgG2a response after lethal challenge than mice immunized with inactivated virus (Cenna et al., 2008). A later study showed M-deleted RABV is even more potent than P-deleted in mice, inducing greater IgG and VNA titers and protecting 100% of lethally challenged mice even at immunization titers as low as 103 foci-forming units (Cenna et al., 2009). Notably, neither P- or M-deleted virus induced clinical signs of rabies, nor were they found in the brain or spinal cord following intramuscular injection of immunocompromised RAG2 knockout mice (Cenna et al., 2008, Cenna et al., 2009).",

RABV G has a critical role in the attachment and entry of the virus into host cells, which makes G one of the most important determinants of viral pathogenicity (Dietzschold et al., 1983, Dietzschold et al., 2008, Pulmanausahakul et al., 2008). Particles lacking G undergo one complete cycle of intracellular replication and produce progeny that are unable to spread (Mebatsion et al., 1996a, Mebatsion et al., 1996b), as shown by infection of single neurons following intracranial inoculation of a G-deleted RABV (Etessami et al., 2000, Wickersham et al., 2007a). Virus particles lacking G are still capable of budding, although at a 30-fold lower efficiency (Mebatsion et al., 1996a, Mebatsion et al., 1996b). These virions, however, are incapable of attachment and entry into a secondary host cell. Gomme et al. (2010) generated a G-deleted RABV-encoding HIV-1 Gag for development of an HIV-1 vaccine. Compared to the replication-competent parental virus, G-deleted RABV generated lower RABV-specific antibody responses but equivalent HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Moreover, these responses were enhanced by a heterologous boost with a G-deleted RABV complemented with VSV glycoprotein. This shows that single-cycle RABV is a promising platform for safe, live viral vaccines and further studies will analyze if similar responses can be induced in nonhuman primates.",

As a vaccine strategy, it is employed where a substantial humoral response is known to be a good correlate of protection. RABV G chimeras carrying the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) had sufficient incorporation of PA in the virions. Both live and killed viral particles induced anti-PA antibodies in mice that were detectable postprime and increased after boost (Smith et al., 2006).",
