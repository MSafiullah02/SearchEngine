Symptoms include fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and LRT illness such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. 1,2 Influenza C virus has been shown to be a significant cause of URT illness in children less than 6 years old, and the risk of complications with LRT illness is particularly high in children less than 2 years old, 2,3 resulting in more severe illness and hospitalization. 4, 5 In adult volunteer studies, the disease caused by influenza C can vary from an asymptomatic to a mild upper respiratory tract infection. 6 A case of acute encephalopathy associated with influenza C has also been reported. 7 Influenza C virus has been documented as the etiological cause of several outbreaks in schools and the community [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ; hence, its role in adding to the overall burden of respiratory illness should not be underestimated. High rates of seroprevalence have been reported for influenza C, suggesting that the virus is circulating widely in the population. 1, [14] [15] [16] Historically, the under-diagnosis of influenza C has resulted from the difficulty in culturing this virus and the lack of readily available monoclonal antibodies for detection by direct florescence microscopy. Although MDCK and HMV-II cells have been used for the isolation of influenza C, [17] [18] [19] [20] the rate of recovery is low. Amniotic inoculation of embryonated hen's eggs remains the most sensitive technique to isolate this virus; however, few clinical laboratories have this capability. Molecular assays for detection of this virus have been few and essentially based on end-point or two-step real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (rt RT-PCR).
