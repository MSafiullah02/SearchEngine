The Group recognized that the Derby Festival is a large, multi-day, outdoor event that lasts 2 weeks, ending after the running of the Kentucky Derby horse race on the first Saturday in May. During the Festival, numerous outdoor events attract thousands of visitors. For example, \u201cThunder Over Louisville,\u201d a large fireworks demonstration, attracts close to 500,000 persons, in addition to a large television audience. The large gatherings could provide a venue for significant disease transmission due to an emergent disease or an intentional release of a bioterrorism agent.",
