The proposed model is rich enough to capture different aspects of a complex virus diffusion as humanity has been recently facing. The model being continuous it is bound to be solved analytically and/or numerically. So, we investigate two possible models where the diffusion coefficient associated with possible types of contamination are captured by some specific profiles. The active cases curves here derived were able to successfully describe the pandemic behavior of Germany and Spain. Moreover, we also predict some scenarios for the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. The scenarios unveil how the lockdown measures can flatten the contamination curves. We can find the best profile of the diffusion coefficient that better fit the real data of pandemic.",

Only two months later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the virus responsible for these pneumonia cases as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2, whose disease was popularly known as coronavirus disease 2019, or simply COVID-19 [1] . Such disease was classified as a public health emergency of international concern at the end of January 2020, by the World Health Organization. Up to now, SARS-CoV-2 has spread all over the world, presenting more than 3.5 million of cases, taken approximately 247107 lives, and has a new epicenter in the United States of America which has reported almost one-third of the total amount of cases [2] . Few places in the world were able to fully control the pandemic of COVID-19. In Europe, for instance, Italy and Spain were for a long time the world's two worst-hit countries by the COVID-19. Now, the numbers of active cases in these two countries are slowly decreasing and they are facing the final stage of the pandemic. One of the best countries in Europe to adopt measures against COVID-19 so far is Germany, who is also entering in the controllable phase of the pandemic. Behind the success of Germany are measures of social distance or lockdown procedures, and a large number of people tested for SARS-CoV-2 [3] .",

An interesting modification of this equation was proposed in the seminal paper of Petr Horava [10] , in his studies about quantum gravity, where he extended the definition of spectral dimension to theories on smooth spacetimes in anisotropic or Lifshitz scaling. In our investigation, we introduce a new version of the diffusion equation inspired by Horava's work, and we use it to fit real active cases data of COVID-19 from Germany, Spain and Brazil. The diffusion equation with the Lifshitz scalling and the equation of motion for the diffusion coefficient are going to be introduced in section II. In section III we are going to show different solutions for the diffusion equation which can be used to fit the evolution of COVID-19. The availability of our models are carefully discussed in section IV. Then, we present our final remarks and perspectives in section V.",

The complexity of a virus transmission such as SARS-CoV-2, demands a diffusion process characterized by a probability density \u03c1 = \u03c1(x, \u03c4 ; x , \u03c4 ; \u03c3) measuring the diffusion from a time \u03c4 to a time \u03c4 , and from a space coordinate x to x at a diffusion time \u03c3. Notice that \u03c3 and \u03c4 are two different types of time, \u03c4 would be understood as the standard time variation of the pandemic, while \u03c3 would control the collective response to the pandemic, such as social distance measures, for instance. Besides, as each country can adopt several strategies to mitigate the pandemic effects, it is expected that the diffusion process would account for different degrees of anisotropy. A general continuous diffusion equation that attends such criteria was introduced by Horava in his seminal work [10] , whose form is",

The Lifshitz critical exponent is essential to determine the spectral dimension, which can be applied to several geometric objects presenting fractal behavior [10] . The relative sign (\u22121) z+1 concerns the requirement of ellipticity of the diffusion operator valid for integer z, but the results can be analytically continued for any positive real z [10, 11] . An extra relevant ingredient to proper modeling a pandemic spread is a diffusion coefficient, which can account for the transmission rate of the virus.

The number of active cases is also a relevant metric for public health and primary care functions, as it allows measuring capacity versus hospitalization needs. Such a number is used to plot the distributions of active cases of COVID-19 for different countries as we see in [3] . Before starting to make numerical integrals of Eq. (7) to depict the active cases curves, let us comment on the dimensionality of the model. A (spatial) bi-dimensional model seems most natural to discuss the diffusion process in the population. This usually is captured by the bi-dimensional networks with persons being nodes and relation being links [12] . Moreover, one particular feature of the transmission of this virus is that it occurs by contact between persons [1] . This feature is captured by a nearest-neighbor interaction between the nodes. It can be argued that one can project down this nearest-neighbor interaction bi-dimensional network into a long-range interaction chain (one-dimensional chain) with appropriate boundary conditions. Thus in the passing to the continuum model we can in a reasonable approximation consider a D = 1 model with x ranging from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e. For the numerical integration in the reciprocal space, we can take therefore \u2212\u221e \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u221e, and \u2212\u221e \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e. Moreover, we choose evaluate \u03c1 at x = x indicating that the probability density is measured in the same spatial location after the evolution of the diffusion process.",

Although, our curves seem to be in good agreement with the active cases data so far, and we also can realize that a long time social distance flatten the curves of the active cases. The peaks of the two active cases curves from Figs. 8, and 9 have considerable differences about 115000, and 141000 cases, respectively. Moreover, the peaks are predicted to happen on days 92 (May 27, 2020), and 86 (May 21, 2020) for black and red solid curves from Fig. 8 , and on days 95 (May 30, 2020), and 110 (June 04, 2020) for black and red curves from Fig. 9 . It is relevant to mention, that up to May 02, 2020, Brazil can attend in maximum 32703 patients with needs for ICU [25] . Besides, the solutions from Fig. 8 predict that the pandemic in Brazil will not be fully controlled earlier than day 131 (June 22, 2020). In the longer predicted scenario, observed in the red solid curve of Fig. 9 , the pandemic will going to be fully controlled after day 198 (August 28, 2020), when the number of active cases is less than 1000. We also realize that the double anti-kink like solutions are able to fit better the real data than the single kink-like ones, reproducing the increasing in the number of active cases after day 48. In these graphics we present the active cases solutions for t = 2\u03c4 (time in days), D = 1, x = x , \u03c1 0 = 10 5 , \u03c4 = 47.5, \u03c4 1 = 40.5, \u03ba = 0.06, s = 1, \u03b2 = 10 7 , z = 50, \u03c3 = 30 (black solid curve), and \u03c3 = 90 (red solid curve).

The diffusion time \u03c3 is analogous to the so-called fictitious time in stochastic quantization theories [26] . We were able to find an analytic solution for this diffusion equation, and to use the standard Gaussian curves to interpret \u03c3 as the lockdown time, if such an equation is applied to model pandemic cases. Therefore, we investigate two possible models with \u03c6(\u03c4 ) having (anti)kink, and double (anti)kink-like profiles. These models were used to fit real active cases data of COVID-19 from three different countries (Germany, Spain, and Brazil). We successfully depicted the active cases curves for Germany and Spain, and use them to constraint some of our free parameters to generate curves for Brazil. Then, we predicted four scenarios for the advance of the pandemic in Brazil, based on 30 and 90 lockdown days. Up to May 02, 2020, 16.57% of active cases in Brazil are classified as critical [3] . Therefore, knowing that Brazil has 32703 ICU facilities available [25] , the maximum number of active cases allowed for this country is 197363, if the rate of critical cases still constant in the next weeks, as well as if the ICUs were allocated only for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. These scenarios alert for a potential crash in the health care system of Brazil if no lockdown measure is taken in the next weeks. Moreover, the solution which best fitted the active cases data up to May 02, 2020 is the red curve from Fig. 9 . Such a solution predicts that the pandemic is going to be fully controlled after day 198 (August 28, 2020), when the number of active cases is less than 1000.",

Another interesting perspective consists in investigating solutions for the diffusion equation derived from models with multiple (anti)lump like solutions, such as those presented in [28] .
