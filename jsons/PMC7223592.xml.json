On the other hand, it has been shown that cerebral arterial bed compliance decreases after hyperventilation in normal subjects [8] and in TBI patients [9]. This effect could influence tau in the opposite direction, shortening it. In normo-ventilated TBI patients, a decrease in arterial cerebral compliance has also been observed [10].",

The study protocol was presented prospectively to the multidisciplinary NCCU user committee to address ethical issues concerning the publication of these data, which were routinely collected as a part of standard clinical management. Since data were fully anonymized, there were no data protection issues involved; it was agreed that formal informed consent was not required for this report. Studies were performed on day 4 \u00b1 3 after injury. Subjects were part of a previously- published prospective study about the time course of cerebral blood flow velocity and intracranial pressure after moderate hyperventilation [11]. The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The same cohort has been studied in a retrospective analysis of cerebral arterial compliance [9], but tau has not been addressed so far.",

Patients were managed according to a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)-orientated protocol, maintaining CPP < 70 mm Hg and ICP > 25 mm Hg [11]. ABP was measured invasively with an intra-arterial catheter inserted in the radial artery. ICP was monitored using an intraparenchymal probe (Codman MicroSensor ICP Transducer, Codman & Shurtleff, Raynham, M.A., USA). Flow velocity (FV) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (Multi Dop X4, DWL Elektronische Systeme, Sipplingen, Germany). End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) was monitored using mainstream capnography (Marquette solar 8000 M; Medelco, Boynton Beach, F.L., USA). Data were continuously monitored and recorded simultaneously using analog-to-digital conversion and waveform time integration.

In one of the groups, EtCO2 was changed in 9 animals between 35\u201355 mm Hg by adjusting the tidal volume of the ventilator. The changes in ventilation also generated changes in arterial blood pressure in some cases, which made the interpretation of the hypocapnia action more difficult. However, in 6 animals the changes in arterial pressure were limited, demonstrating an inverse response in CVR in relation to EtCO2 change. When studying the animals together with empirical regression, the increase in EtCO2 elicited a decrease in CVR. CVR decreased on average to 65% (p  < 0.05) of the value observed at an EtCO2 of 35 mm Hg (lower normocapnia). On the other hand, Ca increased, but at a lesser rate. As a result, tau got shorter.

Tau got significantly longer. This was related to (c) a greater change in CVR, which increased, compared to (d) the change in Ca, which decreased. This decrease in Ca had already been found in this same group of patients by Carrera et al. [9]. This research hypothesized that the reduction in Ca during hypocapnia is related to an increase in arterial microvascular tone; this reduces the ability of the arterial bed to compensate for added cerebral arterial blood volume in each arterial pulse.

Note the lower pulsatility of the venous velocity profile, which therefore can be approximated by a constant flow. The lower curve shows the CaBV as calculated with the above described model. Note that the volume keeps increasing when the velocity has already started to fall. The ECG is shown below the two curves to facilitate the understanding of each pulse profile. The timing between the pulsatile inflow and outflow curves with the resultant change in CBV during a cardiac cycle is schematically demonstrated in the figure. The arterial inflow equals the venous outflow at times t2, t3 and t4.
