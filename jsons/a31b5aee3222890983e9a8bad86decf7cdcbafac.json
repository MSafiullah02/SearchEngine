On the basis of surveillance reports 153 (76%) infections were acquired in a health care facility. Hence, stringent control measures were instituted for health care workers at all health care facilities in Singapore by 9 April.

The GHQ 28 is a self-administered 28-item screening test aimed at detecting psychiatric caseness in community settings [7] . 2. The IES is a self-administered 15-item questionnaire that has been used widely for assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a wide variety of trauma populations [8] . The threshold score for this instrument varies between 25 and 40 for a person at risk of PTSD. The IES has been shown to be the best of several measures when it comes to diagnostic performance, with one study showing a threshold of 35 assigning a correct diagnosis of PTSD to 89% of subjects [9] . Hence, in this study a score >30 was chosen for indicating PTSD. 3. Questionnaire on changes in life's priorities and coping (see the Appendix). This questionnaire was developed specifically for this study, as there were no suitable scales available for measuring changes in life's priorities and coping among health care workers as a result of SARS. The questionnaire was meant to be descriptive and, hence, it was not validated. This was a 15-item questionnaire on a six-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = not sure but probably disagree, 4 = not sure but probably agree, 5 = agree and 6 = strongly agree). It was composed of two subscales, a six-item subscale looking at possible changes in life's priorities as a result of SARS and a nine-item subscale looking at the circumstances that helped contribute to coping with the SARS situation. The first subscale looked at the importance of health, relationship with the family, friends and colleagues, work and spiritual beliefs in their lives. The second subscale explored the importance in helping them cope with the SARS situation of clear communication of directives and disease information about SARS, precautionary measures taken at work, being able to give feedback to management, the support of a supervisor/ manager/head of department, colleagues and family, being able to confide in someone and religious convictions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 310, "end": 313, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 608, "end": 611, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Self-report measures"}, {"text": "All analyses were performed using SPSS 11.0.

Some studies performed in the UK have shown that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders using the 12-item GHQ amongst doctors and nurses was between 28 and 32% [10] [11] [12] . To date there has been no published literature on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among health care workers in Singapore. However, a survey carried out by the authors in June 2002 in this same hospital showed a similar prevalence of between 28 and 35% for psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses using the 28-item GHQ (unpublished data). From this survey, although it was perceived that the SARS situation had greatly impacted on the emotional state of health care workers, there was no significant change in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among health care workers (35% of doctors and 25% of nurses) in this hospital who responded. However, doctors were more likely than nurses to suffer from a psychiatric disorder and health care workers who were single were at higher risk. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between those who were or were not exposed to SARS patients and those working in high-risk areas or those in the general wards. Although this result was rather unexpected, it could be explained. In Singapore all suspect or probable cases of SARS are transferred immediately upon diagnosis to the SARS-designated hospital. The hospital in this study was not the SARSdesignated hospital and only a small number of SARS patients were identified here. Perhaps this limited contact with SARS patients in the study hospital may have resulted in this unexpected outcome. Whatever the reason, the SARS situation did affect health care workers, regardless of exposure to SARS patients or work areas.

The burden of ensuring that suspect or probable SARS patients are identified quickly and transferred to the SARS-designated hospital lay heavily on their shoulders.

Maintaining this state of high alert for an extended period of time is not only difficult, but also extremely stressful. This could explain the higher rates of anxiety disorders amongst the doctors.

As the survey was conducted 2 months after the outbreak of SARS, the IES scores suggested that approximately 20% of the doctors and nurses were suffering from PTSD. This was considerably higher than was reported in the June 2002 survey, which showed a prevalence rate of 8% using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (unpublished data). It was expected that those who had been exposed to SARS patients would be more traumatized, but interestingly there was no significant difference between the two groups. This implied that the SARS situation was perceived by all to be an equally traumatic experience regardless of exposure experience to SARS patients. Many health care workers in Singapore had friends and/or family who were also health care workers. Forty-two per cent of those diagnosed to be infected by SARS were health care workers and five of them eventually died. Maunder et al. [6] highlighted the emotional effects on health care workers whenever other health care workers were admitted with an unclear infection and the strong emotional identification with these colleagues who later became patients. In addition, the media during this period was constantly highlighting the morbidity and mortality rates of SARS, focusing particularly on index cases and affected health care workers.

This is consistent with the findings of Freeborn [13] , who perceived that control over the practice environment, support from colleagues and satisfaction with the availability of resources were associated with higher levels of physician satisfaction at work and organizational commitment.

However, current research has signalled the importance of stress in the context of the organization where job tasks and job roles, patterns of communication and cultural norms are key factors in reducing worker stress [15] .
