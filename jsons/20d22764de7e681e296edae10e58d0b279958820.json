The percentage of each land cover type was calculated by overlaying this dataset with the study watershed boundaries as previously described. Population density (persons/km 2 ), housing unit density (units/km 2 ) and road density (km/km 2 ) were calculated by overlaying data from the 2010 U.S. Census 2 and the 2011 Census of Canada 3 with the watershed boundaries. Eigenvector decomposition was used to address the problems created by the complex correlation structure of landuse/landcover data as well as census-derived variables. Eigenvector decomposition generated 5 orthogonal, rotated components (Table S6) . Component one (C1) explained 40% of variation in the data and represented an index of human development, being composed of heavy positive loadings of human population (0.95) and housing unit density (0.95) as well as developed area (0.90), road density (0.77) and a lesser loading of row crops (0.62). Component two (C2), explaining 20% of the variation, represented a positive loading of grassland (0.96), and a negative loading on forest area (-0.72). Component three (C3), explaining 14% of the variation, represented an index of the scrub land cover type (0.98). Component four (C4), explaining 13% of variation, correlated almost perfectly (0.96) with wetland area but was also weakly associated (0.45) with row crops. Component five (C5) explained 13% of variation and accounted principally for areas of grazing land (0.82), but was also associated with row crops (0.53).",

In order to estimate approximate associations of trapping success with habitat features, the terrestrial landcover and census variables (as used elsewhere in this paper) were calculated within a 564m radius circular buffer around each trap location (total area 100ha). This value was chosen based on the report by Gillette 5 of mean distance between most distant dens of 565m and home ranges up to 108ha. On this basis, it is likely that most of the home ranges of the trapped animals is within the buffer. Binomial regression was used to predict the success of each trap based on land cover types. Separate regression models were fit for each variable (scaled and centered) as they are highly correlated.",

This small dataset should be interpreted with caution as specific habitat use is unknown, and so it is at best an indication of the general features of broad areas where opossums may be found, not an indication of actual habitat use by these animals. These caveats notwithstanding, the results that opossums may be found near water bodies, developed areas and forested areas are broadly in agreement with other studies.",
