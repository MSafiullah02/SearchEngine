Electronic aptamer-based sensors (aptasensors) hold great promise as analytical devices for the detection of low-molecular-weight substrates or proteins. The Minireview highlights the advantages of electronic transduction of aptasensor systems and discusses the latest developments in the design of electrochemical, field-effect transistor, and piezoelectric aptasensor systems. Darwinian chemistry was first practiced by Spiegelman and colleagues in 1967 when they carried out the Darwinian evolution of RNA molecules in a test tube. In the following 40 years, the directed evolution of RNA has become a highly fruitful area of research and has deepened our understanding of evolutionary processes at the molecular level.",
