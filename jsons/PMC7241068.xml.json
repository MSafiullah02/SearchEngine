This pathology affects the central nervous system of fish, resulting in septicaemia and meningoencephalitis. S. parauberis was initially described as an aetiological agent of bovine mastitis (Williams and Collins 1990; Khan et al. 2003). Since then, S. parauberis has become an emerging pathogen in the aquaculture industry responsible for streptococcosis epizootics mainly in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) farmed in Spain (Domenech et al. 1996), in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus and Platichthys stellatus) farmed in Asian countries (Aoki et al. 1990; Baeck et al. 2006; Cho et al. 2008), and sea bass (Sebastes ventricosus) farmed in Japan (Oguro et al. 2014). Recently, S. parauberis was also isolated from wild striped sea bass (Morone saxatilis) in North America (USA) (Haines et al. 2013). Diversity among S. parauberis isolates was reported at genotypic and serological levels (Austin and Austin 2016).",

These structures play an important role in pathogenicity, immune system escape, serum resistance, inflammation, adhesion, biofilm formation, and antigenicity, which may be used for bacterial serotyping (Okura et al. 2013; Rochat et al. 2017). The diversity of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) structure of S. parauberis, due to a variety of sugars and glycosidic linkages, led to the description of different serotypes designated as types I, II, and III (Kanai et al. 2009; Kanai et al. 2015; Tu et al. 2015a; Torres Corral et al. 2019). Serotype I was further subdivided into three subtypes, designated Ia, Ib, and Ic (Kanai et al. 2015; Tu et al. 2015a). S. parauberis isolates agglutinating with antibodies of serotypes I and II were also described and designated as non-typable strains (Kanai et al. 2015; Tu et al. 2015a).",

The genetic structure of the loci cps in S. parauberis has been determined in serotypes I and II (Tu et al. 2015a). In these serotypes a cassette-like structure was observed, in which the conserved regions flanked serotype-specific genes. At the conserved 5\u2032 end of the cps regions, a group of five regulatory genes (lysR, cpsA. cpsB, cpsC, and cpsD) and one processing gene (cpsE) were found, while at the conserved 3\u2032 end, one regulatory gene (cpsQ) and one hypothetical gene were found. The middle region (variable region) of the locus cps comprises genes encoding enzymes such as glycosyltransferases, acetyltransferases, aminotransferases, and modifying enzymes (Tu et al. 2015a).",

Serotyping is, therefore, a necessary tool for the diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of streptococcosis caused by S. parauberis. However, serotyping has important limitations such as sensitivity, specificity, and the need to obtain antisera from animals. These limitations added to the recent determination of complete genomic sequences of a wide variety of bacteria have allowed the development of new molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacterial typing. In recent years, different PCR bacterial typing protocols have emerged as an alternative for the use of antisera in pathogenic fish species, such as Streptococcus agalactiae (Demczuk et al. 2017; Kannika et al. 2017; Shoemaker et al. 2017), Flavobacterium psychrophylum (Rochat et al. 2017), S. parauberis (Tu et al. 2015b), and Lactococcus garvieae (Ohbayashi et al. 2017).",

This bacterial collection included reference strain representatives of the different serotypes described for S. parauberis (serotypes I, II, III. and non-typeable strains). These reference strains were used for the optimization of the qPCR and mPCR protocols and as positive control in all reactions. The bacteria were grown on Tryptic Soy Agar with 1% NaCl (w/v) (TSA-1) at 25 \u00b0C for 24 h. Tenacibaculum and Flavobacterium strains were grown at the appropriate temperatures on Flexibacter maritimus medium (FMM) (Pazos et al. 1996) and FLP medium (Cepeda et al. 2004), respectively. Stock bacterial cultures were frozen at \u2212 80 \u00b0C in Microbank\u2122 commercial medium (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, ON, Canada). Before the analysis, the taxonomic position of the strains used in this study was confirmed by using standard microbiological analysis and/or specie-specific PCR as described (Buller 2014; Austin and Austin 2016; Torres Corral et al. 2019).

LC060252), Ib (strain NUF1003, LC060253), Ic (strain NUF1071, LC060254), and II (strain NUF1032, LC060255) of S. parauberis previously described by Tu et al. (2015a). The locus cps detected in these genomes has the cassette-like structure previously described for serotypes I and II (Tu et al. 2015a), in which serotype-specific genes are flanked by conserved regions. The upper conserved region of the loci cps involves five regulatory genes, lysR (homology between serotypes > 99%) and cpsABCD (homology between serotypes > 95%), and a processing gene, cpsE (homology between serotypes > 98%) (Supplemental Table S2, Fig. 1). The lower conserved region involves two genes, the cpsQ gene, which encodes for a dehydrogenase responsible for capsule processing (homology between serotypes > 80%), and the cpsR gene, which encodes for a hypothetical protein (homology between serotypes > 99%) (Supplemental Table S2, Fig. 1). Based on the comparative genomic analysis, the variable regions of the cps loci previously associated (Tu et al. 2015a) with the serotypes Ia (strain KRS02083), Ib (NUF1003), Ic (NUF1071), and II (NUF1032) were clearly evidenced. The serotype-specific genes described for subserotype Ia (Tu et al. 2015a) were also identified in the whole genomes available in the NCBI database of strains isolated from Japanese flounder (KRS02083 and KCTC11980), suggesting that these strains were subserotype Ia. The serotype-specific region associated to serotype II was detected only in the whole genome of one strain isolated from Japanese flounder (KRS02109), suggesting that this strain was serotype II. Three variable regions (named as III, IV, and V), different to those described by Tu et al. (2015a) for subserotypes Ia, Ib, Ic, and serotype II, were also identified and represented in Fig. 1. The variable region III was detected in the genome of strains AZ70.1 (Supplemental Table S1 for NCBI accession no.) and T1 (Supplemental Table S1) isolated from turbot in Spain and in the genome of strains RP17, PL23, PL9, RP15, RP25, N198_2, and N11 (Supplemental Table S1) isolated from wild striped bass in USA. In this region, genes that encode transferases and epimerases were mostly detected (Supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 1). The cps3F gene of the region III, coding for a glucosyltransferase, showed homology of 99, 44, and 25% with the genes cps1aF (serotype Ia), cps1bG (serotype Ib), and cps4G (strain NCDFD2020), respectively. The genes cps3G and cps3P, both epimerases encoders, showed a homology of 75% with cps1aG (serotype Ia) and of 74% with cps1aP (serotype Ia) and cps1bP (serotype Ib), respectively (Fig. 1). The genes cps3H, cps3I, cps3J, cps3K, and cps3L were only detected in the variable region III. The variable region IV that contains mainly genes encoding for transferases and dehydrogenases (Supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 1) was identified in the genome sequence (Supplemental Table S1) of the reference strain NCDO 2020 isolated from mastitis sample milk The cps4G gene, coding for transferase, showed a homology > 25% with the genes cps1aF (serotype Ia), cps1bG (serotype Ib), and cps3F (strains AZ70.1, T1, RP17, PL23, PL9, RP15, RP25, N198_2, and N11) (Fig. 1). The genes cps4F, cps4H, cps4I, cps4J, cps4k, cps4L, cps4M, cps4N, and cps4O did not show homology with the genes of the other variable regions. The variable region V was identified in the genome of the strain KCTC 11537 (Supplemental Table S1) isolated from Japanese flounder and in the genome of strain SK-417 (Supplemental Table S1) isolated from Japanese black seaperch.

S. parauberis was originally described as phenotypically and serologically homogeneous (Toranzo et al. 1995), but several serological types have been reported over the years using conventional serotyping methods (Kanai et al. 2009, 2015; Torres Corral et al. 2019). Conventional serotyping based on the use of mono- or polyclonal sera and inactivated whole cell is the method more commonly used in clinical diagnostic laboratories. However, the use of this method is limited by the unavailability of specific commercial sera which difficult the comparison of the results within laboratories. PCR-based bacterial serotyping protocols have therefore emerged as a promising alternative to conventional serotyping. These mechanisms do not require the use of sera, but it is necessary to identify molecular markers that determine serotypes as a prerequisite for designing specific primers (Fratamico et al. 2016; Rochat et al. 2017).",

(2015a) for serotypes I and II. A locus cps with a cassette-like structure, a variable region flanked by conserved regions, was found in 15 genomes of S. parauberis analyzed in the present study. This locus structure was previously described in the cps loci of S. parauberis strains belonging to serotypes I and II (Tu et al. 2015b), and other Streptococcus (Bentley et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2011; Morais et al. 2018). In addition, in the present study, three variable regions (named III, IV, and V) within the loci cps, different from those described for serotypes I and II, were identified. These variable regions could represent serotype-specific regions of three different serotypes (serotypes III, IV, and V) of S. parauberis. In silico comparative analysis of the partial sequence of the cps3K gene of the variable region III obtained from three S. parauberis strains of the serotype III showed more than 99% homology with the variable region III detected in the genome of S. parauberis available in the NCBI database and less than 40% homology with genes encoding the same protein in other bacterial species. These results indicated that cps 3K gene is specific of the serotype III strains and suggest that strains isolated from turbot in Spain and striped bass in USA, which genomes are deposited in the NCBI database, could be included into the serotype III of S. parauberis. Based on these results cps 3K gene constitutes an excellent target for design of primers for the detection of strains of S. parauberis serotype III, thereby decreasing the possibility of false positive results. Thus, a primers pair SP3-130F and SP3-130R were designed based on the sequence of the cps3K gene for rapid and specific detection of strains of S. parauberis serotype III using PCR assays. Multiplex PCR assay was optimized for the detection and differentiation of the main serotypes of S. parauberis causing disease in fish (serotypes I, II and III) using the primers described by Tu et al. (2015b) and the primers SP3-130F and SP3-130R designed in the present study. The high correspondence observed between the results of conventional serotyping using antisera and molecular serotyping using multiplex PCR suggests that this rapid and specific typing method could be used in clinical diagnostic laboratories and/or epidemiological studies.",

PCR analysis demonstrated 100% specificity, since only DNA from strains of S. parauberis serotype III were amplified giving a specific peak at a Tm of 73 \u00b1 0.33 \u00b0C. Similar Tm value was obtained using as template DNA from fish tissues experimentally or naturally infected with S. parauberis of serotype III. No amplifications were observed using bacterial suspensions or DNA extracted from other serotypes of S. parauberis or unrelated bacteria. The quantification of the bacterial load was assessed through a standard curve generated by plotting the values of Cq versus the logarithm of the amount (ng) of amplicon as previously described (Fern\u00e1ndez-\u00c1lvarez et al. 2016; Torres-Corral et al. 2019).

High specificity and sensitivity were found using the described protocol and lethal fish samples, with detection levels of 1.25 \u00d7 104 to 1.76 \u00d7 102 gene copies of the cps3K gene in tissues of fish infected with strains of S. parauberis belonging to serotype III. High levels of detection (2.49 \u00d7 103\u20137.37 \u00d7 102 gene copies) were also observed using this qPCR protocol and DNA obtained from non-lethal fish samples (blood samples) as template, suggesting that this non-lethal diagnostic and typing method could be used without the need for bacterial isolation or the use of anti-S. parauberis sera. Detection levels using DNA extracted from infected fish tissues were lower than those obtained from pure bacterial cultures (bacterial suspensions or DNA extracted from bacterial cultures), possibly due to the presence of host DNA or tissue inhibitors such as hemoglobin or serum proteins (Wiklund et al. 2000; Cepeda et al. 2003; Fern\u00e1ndez-\u00c1lvarez et al. 2019; Torres-Corral et al. 2019). Further studies using a high number of strains isolated from different fish species and other animals in different geographic area will help to determine the serological diversity of S. parauberis and to develop new diagnostic tools.",

Serotype-specific regions were used to optimize a mPCR protocol capable of differentiating the main S. parauberis serotypes causing disease in fish (serotypes I, II, and III). In addition, a qPCR assay to identify and quantify strains of S. parauberis belonging to serotype III from bacterial cultures and fish tissues has been optimized. These PCR protocols could be useful tool in epidemiological surveillance studies or for diagnostic purposes using bacterial culture and lethal and non-lethal fish tissues as samples. The PCR methods described are inexpensive with low risk of contamination that can be implemented as a tool for diagnosis and typing in clinical laboratories, thus avoiding the disadvantages of conventional serological methods.",
