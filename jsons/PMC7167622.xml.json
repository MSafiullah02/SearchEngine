However, real\u2010time PCR did not influence antibiotic prescription in one single patient. Therefore, we believe that the inclusion of additional patients is not likely to influence our observation that the impact of real\u2010time PCR is minor. Second, the fact that physicians were aware of the study may have influenced their decision on antibiotic prescription. However, this would probably have led to an overestimation of the effect of real\u2010time PCR results on antibiotic use which would only make the conclusion of our study stronger. Third, the turn around time of real\u2010time PCR in our study was between 16 and 24 hr and PCR was performed on working days, so the results were available only at the second working day. Possibly, if results had been available earlier this could have had more effect on antibiotic prescription practices (physicians will probably be more reluctant to stop antibiotic treatment than not to start it). However, we aimed to evaluate the impact of real\u2010time PCR in daily practice, and in most hospitals both DIF and real\u2010time PCR are only performed on working days (i.e., Monday\u2013Friday) with the same turn around times for both tests.30\n",

This increased diagnostic yield was not, however, accompanied by a decrease in antibiotic prescription. This finding is in contrast with our survey study in which real\u2010time PCR decreased the percentage of antibiotic description by 16\u201342% (absolute reduction; P < 0.001 for all cases). Apparently, the treatment of paper patients is not the same as treating patients in daily PICU practice, in which physicians seem to prefer to stay on the safe side. In daily practice, physicians seem to make clinical decisions on other grounds than results from diagnostic investigations. Reasons for not stopping antibiotic treatment in PCR positive patients were the clinical suspicion of a (secondary) bacterial super infection, and the fact that the results of bacterial cultures were still unknown. Additional to the lack of effect of real\u2010time PCR on antibiotic use found in this study, one may wonder what the effect of any viral test such as DIF may be, since a considerable proportion of patients (47%) received antibiotics regardless of a positive DIF result.",

Our results are in agreement with Doan et al.10 and Poehling et al.,12 who did not find a reduction in antibiotic prescription in children randomized to have rapid testing performed at the emergency department. Our results are in contrast with studies from Bonner et al.,9 Noyola and Demmler,11 Sharma et al.,13 and Woo et al.,14 who found that physicians prescribed less antibiotics in patient groups tested with a rapid viral test. These studies were all performed at the emergency department or at pediatric wards, and not at the PICU, and assessed different age groups. It can be expected that physicians in a PICU setting are more reluctant to withhold antibiotic treatment in the severely ill population with LRTI who frequently has underlying diseases. This is reflected in our population by the finding that in the 38 ventilated LTRI patients 21 children started with antibiotics at admission (55%) and antibiotic prescription was not changed in any of the groups, not even in the 9 children with a positive PCR and negative DIF.",

This means that in our PICU population virus positivity does not help clinicians anymore to differentiate between those patients who qualify for antibiotics from those who could safely be treated without antibiotics. Therefore, we propose that future real\u2010time PCR studies should be directed to settings were not all patients are found to harbor viruses, such as the population of children with less severe respiratory tract infection in the community.10\n",
