New diseases, such as ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian or bird \u2018flu\u2019, and West Nile virus emerge, and historically significant diseases, such as diptheria and polio, re-emerge. Smallpox, considered to have been driven to extinction many years ago, has re-emerged as a threat due to the possibility of bioterrorists procuring laboratory samples of the bacterium (see [1], for a quantitative analysis). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is currently threatening to cause more deaths than the great outbreaks of plague in the 14th century (of the order of 25 million deaths or one in four Europeans at the time) and influenza, which caused about 20 million deaths in the early 20th century [2]. Furthermore, epidemics in agricultural animals may have catastrophic economic consequences such as in the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain.",

However, it seems apparent that the nature of epidemic growth and spread is for the most part stochastic. Probabilistic models have indeed a long and illustrious history going back to Bernoulli [5] and earlier. Reviews of stochastic epidemiological models are contained in [6], [7], [8].",

These are the Greenwood [9] model and the Reed-Frost model, which evidently was proposed in 1928 in biostatistics lectures at Johns Hopkins, not published by the proponents but subsequently related in [10]. In these models there are successive generations, indexed by t\n = 0, 1, 2, \u2026, of infectives which are only capable of infecting susceptibles for one generation after which they do not participate in the epidemic process. Suppose the population size is n, a constant and let the numbers of susceptibles and (new) infectives of generation t be X(t) and Y(t), respectively. Then the initial condition is X(0) + \nY(0) = \nn and X(t\n + 1) + \nY(t\n + 1) = \nX(t), \nt\n = 0, 1, 2, \u2026, as the infectives and susceptibles of generation t\n + 1 are drawn from the susceptibles of generation t. Thus,X(t)+\u2211j=0tY(j)=n,and the total number infected up to and including generation t is \u2211j=0tY(j). It is assumed that the number of infectives of generation t\n + 1 is a binomial random variable with parameters X(t) and p(Y(t)), the latter being the probability that an existing susceptible will become infected when the number of infectives is Y(t). Thus,P(Y(t+1)=k|X(t)=x,Y(t)=y)=xkp(y)k(1-p(y))x-k,for k\n = 0, 1, \u2026 , \nx. In the Greenwood model, p(y) = \np is a constant not depending on the number y of infectives. In the Reed-Frost model it is supposed that the probability any susceptible escapes being infected when there are y infectives is1-p(y)=(1-p)y,where p\n = \np(1) is the probability a susceptible is infected by one given infective.",

It has been extensively employed in the analysis of agricultural epidemics such as foot and mouth disease in Japanese beef cattle [12], tuberculosis in Argentinian dairy cows [13], [14] and Swedish deer [15]. Despite its apparent simplicity, the Reed-Frost model is not readily analyzed for large n, so that approximations have been sought, such as branching processes in the early stages and a normal approximation for estimating the final size of the epidemic; i.e., the total number infected [16]. However, Ball and O\u2019Neill [19] have succeeded, via a construction of the epidemic process due to Sellke [20], to find the distribution of the final size of an epidemic in the Reed-Frost and other models \u2013 see also [21]. See [22] for some generalizations of the Reed-Frost model with application to HIV. A review of continuous time models may be found in [20].",

One of these concerns the group of individuals encountered by a given individual on a particular day. The most realistic situation would make this group consist of a core subgroup which was met almost on a daily basis, such as family members or colleagues, together with a random subgroup whose numbers and composition would change each day, consisting of persons met in travelling or other activities, such as sporting events, shopping or entertainment. Some interesting results have recently been found for models with some such features [17], [23] but here it was decided to simplify the model by making the group met by each individual not necessarily the same each day, consisting of a fixed number plus a random number, all being chosen at random from the rest of the population. The second feature consists of a period of R days after the infection of an individual such that only during this period is the individual infected and capable of infecting susceptible individuals. We will mainly be concerned with ascertaining the total number of diseased individuals and how long it takes for the disease to vanish from the population (if ever). The case R\n = \u221e is considerably simpler, so we give some analytical formulas for this case and consider a formal diffusion approximation for the number infected as a random function of time.",

Thus the total number of diseased and hence infectious individuals at time t isY(t)=\u2211i=1nYi(t),t\u2a7e0.\n(d)Individual i encounters a fixed number (not random) n\ni of other individuals each day, drawn randomly from the population. Individual i also meets a randomly chosen and random number M\ni(t) of other individuals over (t, \nt\n + 1]. The variables M\ni(t) are mutually independent and independent of the state of the population. These random variables may be, for example, uniformly distributed or have specially tailored discrete distributions to represent as accurately as possible chance meetings in human populations. The total number of individuals met by person i over (t, \nt\n + 1] is thus N\ni(t) = \nn\ni\n + \nM\ni(t). An alternative way to view this is that individual i never has less than n\ni contacts. We here consider time homogeneous models so that the distribution of M\ni(t) is the same for all t.(e)If an individual becomes infective, he remains in such a state for R consecutive time points including the initial time point of becoming infected where R is a positive integer constant. (In general R could be a random variable, or even a random process, but this complication is ignored throughout.) Thus, if an individual is diseased for the first time at epoch t, then he is diseased and infectious for the epochs {t, \nt\n + 1, \u2026 , \nt\n + \nR\n \u2212 1}. At epoch t\n + \nR such an individual recovers but cannot be re-infected. (In real time, if an individual is susceptible at time t\n \u2212 1 and infected at time t then it is assumed that he became infected somewhere in the interval (t\n \u2212 1, \nt]). For example, if R\n = 2 and individual i becomes infected at some time, then Y\ni(t), \nt\n = 0, 1, 2, \u2026 is a string of zeros except for two consecutive time points at which there are ones. We call R the recovery period, although it could equally well be called the infectious period. We also consider the case R\n = \u221e which gives no recovery and hence reduces the model to one of SI type rather than SIR.(f)If an individual who has never been diseased up to and including time t encounters an individual in (t, \nt\n + 1] who is diseased at time t, then independently of the results of other encounters, this encounter results in transmission of the disease with probability p\n \u2208 [0, 1], whereupon the individual is infected at epoch t\n + 1.(g)Given Y(t), the probability that a randomly chosen individual is diseased at time t is given by f(t)=Y(t)n.\n",

The data are the same as for Fig. 12, Fig. 13 but are plotted differently. When transmission is fairly likely, p\n \u2a7e 0.2, nearly the whole population is infected regardless of the length of the recovery period. Furthermore, when transmission is very unlikely at p\n = 0.02 only small numbers are infected even when the recovery period is as large as 4 days. The dependence on R is thus not severe at very small or relatively large transmission probabilities. By contrast, at intermediate values of p, as R increases there is a rapid increase of mean epidemic size. Hence at such values of p, reducing the infectious period can have an extremely beneficial effect on the containment of the spread of the disease.",

By analytical and simulation methods we considered how the parameters of the model affected the time course of the spread of the disease and the final outcome in terms of total cases and total duration. Apart from the initial condition there are four variable elements: n, the total population size; p, the probability of transmission from diseased to susceptible; R, the number of days an individual remains infective; and the set of N\ni, i\n = 1.2, \u2026 ,n, where N\ni is the random number of contacts per day made by individual i; N\ni may have fixed and random components. A degree of scale invariance was noted in the sense that the fraction of the population ultimately infected depended on the fraction initially infected rather than the absolute size of the population. This possibly can be interpreted by considering that each initially infected individual more or less starts his own epidemic independently of other initially infected individuals.",

Most noteworthy were the maxima in the mean duration that occur as the contact rate and the probability of transmission increase, and the drastic reductions in the size of the outbreak as the recovery period is reduced for certain, but not all, ranges of the other parameters. These findings may have practical applications as they shed light on some of the factors controlling the size and duration of epidemics and hence their human and economic costs. More simulations will be required to do a thorough investigation of the factors involved. In addition, asymptotic analysis may be useful for large n as well as a comparison of results from the present model with those for differential equation models and the original Reed-Frost model. These aspects will be the subjects of future articles.",
