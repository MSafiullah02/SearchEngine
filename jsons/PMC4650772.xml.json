Initial testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed at the IDH laboratory with confirmatory sequencing performed at the CDC. The CDC rRT-PCR screening assay consists of 2 signatures that target a region upstream of the MERS-CoV envelope protein gene (upE) and the nucleocapsid gene (N2) [8]. A positive test result with either or both assays is then confirmed with a third rRT-PCR assay also targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N3). Serology was done using a recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein\u2013based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed by the CDC. This ELISA was developed using a modified version of the HKU5.2 N ELISA as described [9]. In brief, sera were considered positive when the optical density (OD) values were at or above the 0.36 cutoff value (mean absorbance at 405 nm of sera from US blood donors plus 3 standard deviations). The overall specificity of the assay was determined after screening 555 serum samples from donors in the United States and the Middle East and persons with other non-MERS respiratory infections (eg, human coronavirus [HCoV] OC43, HCoV-229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, H1N1). The assay specificity was 98.1% (544/555). Serum from HKU1 human sera was not available for evaluation; however, HKU1 mouse hyperimmune serum did not cross-react with the MERS-CoV N protein. At a screening dilution of 1:400, sera with OD values at or near the cutoff were titrated with serial 2- to 4-fold dilutions (1:100\u20131:6400). The assay sensitivity was determined by screening a limited number of serum samples from individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection (sera provided by Public Health England, Robert Koch Institute, and the Jordan Ministry of Health). Confirmatory testing for MERS-CoV\u2013specific antibodies was done on all positive ELISAs by MERS-CoV immunofluorescence and microneutralization assays [10]. Both confirmatory assays were evaluated using similar panels of sera as described above with similar specificities. Serologic testing was done at the CDC.",

Whereas this patient had the 3 most prevalent symptoms observed in the largest series of 47 MERS-CoV patients from Saudi Arabia [4]\u2014fever (98%), cough (83%), and shortness of breath (72%)\u2014he lacked upper respiratory tract (eg, sore throat, rhinorrhea) and gastrointestinal tract symptoms (eg, diarrhea, vomiting), which have been seen in approximately one-quarter of MERS-CoV patients. The patient's laboratory data were unremarkable except for a mild elevation in liver enzymes, which has been seen in up to 15% of patients [4], lymphopenia, which has been seen in 34%\u201386% of patients [4, 9], and mild elevation in inflammatory markers. The key feature to the diagnosis of MERS-CoV in this patient was the history of practice in and recent travel from KSA [13]. At the time of this case, approximately 88% of the MERS-CoV cases worldwide had occurred in KSA, and infection among healthcare workers is well documented [6, 9, 11]. The number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases identified in KSA increased substantially from March to early May 2014 (318 cases confirmed by WHO from 1 March to 12 May). Because MERS-CoV cases are prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, US clinicians need to be ever more vigilant for MERS-CoV among patients with compatible clinical presentation (eg, fever and severe respiratory illness), travel history (ie, illness onset within 14 days after travel to the Arabian Peninsula or nearby countries), and close contact with a confirmed or probable case [7]. (Although this patient did not recall close contact, his work in a healthcare setting in KSA suggested the potential for unrecognized close contact.) Ten days after this patient's confirmed diagnosis, a second imported case of MERS-CoV was detected in Florida [7] in another healthcare worker who also had worked in KSA. No other US cases have occurred to date.",

This virus was first detected in the patient's serum, when his NP swab was negative [14, 15]. NP swabs, because of their ease of collection, have been the most common sample used in making a diagnosis of MERS-CoV [4]. Nonetheless, there is evidence from some MERS-CoV cases that even when high load of virus is detected in lower respiratory tract specimens, upper respiratory tract specimens can be weakly positive or negative [15, 16]. In this patient, the initial NP sample was negative at a time when the sputum was positive by rRT-PCR at MERS-CoV concentrations that were as high as those from tracheobronchial secretions in other patients who were more critically ill [16]. Moreover, the sputum remained positive for up to 2 days longer than the pharyngeal samples. The serum was also positive by rRT-PCR on 2 occasions during a 4-day period when the nasopharyngeal sample was negative, suggesting a prolonged viremia. Blood and serum samples have been found to be rRT-PCR positive in other patients with MERS-CoV, and these might be more sensitive diagnostic specimens in MERS-CoV patients than in SARS patients [9, 15\u201318]. In contrast to SARS, MERS-CoV has been rarely detected in stool, and when detected was present in relatively low concentration [15, 16, 19]. For diagnostic testing of persons under investigation for MERS-CoV, the CDC states that lower respiratory specimens, which can include induced or expectorated sputa, are preferred; however, collecting NP/oropharyngeal (OP) specimens, as well as stool and serum, are also recommended as soon as possible after symptom onset [20]. If symptom onset was \u226514 days ago, a single serum specimen for serologic testing in addition to a lower respiratory specimen and an NP/OP specimen is recommended, although the kinetics of the antibody response to MERS-CoV infection needs further clarification [20].",

There is no evidence yet for any effective treatment for MERS-CoV infection [21]. In the case series of 47 Saudi MERS-CoV patients, no bacterial coinfection was diagnosed [4]. Although bacterial pneumonia superinfection commonly seen following influenza virus infection has not been demonstrated with novel coronaviruses, WHO has a permissive recommendation for antibiotics based on clinical judgment in patients with novel coronavirus infections [21, 22]. IVIG has not been evaluated in MERS-CoV patients, but is unlikely to have been effective in this patient's recovery given his nonsevere clinical status and the expected absence of MERS-CoV antibodies in pooled sera in the United States. Any immunomodulatory effect of IVIG in this patient is unknown. Although IVIG was administered to patients with SARS-CoV infection during 2003, the effectiveness of IVIG treatment for SARS patients is unknown due to confounders, variable severity of illness when treatment was initiated, and the uncontrolled study design [23]. Due to its potential risks and unknown benefit, IVIG is not recommended to treat MERS-CoV patients. Whereas interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combined therapy has shown some therapeutic potential in cell culture and animal experiments [24, 25], this treatment has not been shown to be effective in MERS-CoV patients. However, these agents have only been implemented late in the course of illness. Steroids are also not recommended for the treatment of MERS-CoV [21].",
