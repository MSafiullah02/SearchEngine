            "text": "Virus specific molecular assays such as real-time PCR (RT-PCR) are now considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections. They are rapid, relatively inexpensive and offer increased sensitivity and specificity over prior techniques such as virus culture and direct immunofluorescence. Assays can be developed quickly to detect novel/emerging pathogens and can be combined to identify multiple microbiological pathogens in a single test. Yet there is a limit to the number of targets, usually up to four, which can be included in an in-house test before compromising test sensitivity. As a result, diagnostic laboratories must develop a panel of multiplex tests in order to detect the whole range of pathogens. Also, as for all PCR based assays, detection is based on targeting conserved regions of the pathogen genome and mutations can lead to reduced sensitivity or false negative results. Furthermore, only the targeted pathogens included in the assay will be identified, therefore atypical or emerging pathogens will generally evade detection by PCR. Although commercial PCR based tests [1] are available that overcome some of the pitfalls associated with in-house tests, they remain PCR based technologies and as a result suffer from the same sequence based pitfalls outlined above.",

Unmapped sequences were entered into the Metamos pipeline [7] which employs multiple de novo assemblers with k-mer optimisation to assemble contigs. The contigs from the most effective assembly were then taxonomically classified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against the GenBank nucleotide and non-redundant databases (cut off E value 0.001). Identical sequences between samples were removed using BedTools and unique sequences were retained for further analysis. Sequenced reads were then mapped back to the top taxonomic hit for each sample and visualized using Tablet [8], to quantify viral reads within each sample and generate a consensus sequence. Where appropriate, greater than 90% of reference genome coverage, the consensus sequences were aligned with known reference sequences and phylogenetic analysis carried out using MEGA6 [9]. Taxonomic hits were compared with the results of the diagnostic qRT-PCR (Table 1\n).",

This finding is similar to that outlined by Prachayangprecha et al. At present, this level of sensitivity is not appropriate for diagnostic services to replace qRT-PCR.

Reducing the contamination of host DNA through host DNA depletion holds the greatest promise [11] to increase the depth of viral and microbial DNA as we found up to 99% of reads obtained per sample were derived from the host.",

The development of kit based library preparation methods has also resulted in a condensed process, reducing hands-on time.
