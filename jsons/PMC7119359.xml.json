It is difficult to believe that 3 years have gone by since B.D. was born to long-time patient L.D., a 33-year-old para 3003. B.D. was the full-term product of a low-risk pregnancy. Labor was uncomplicated except for a prolonged second stage. B.D. has had four ear infections to date and about six colds per year. L.D. is skilled at recognizing when B.D.'s colds can be cared for at home and when medical attention may be required. At this time, B.D. has been experiencing rhinorrhea, cough, and a temperature to 100\u00b0F. On evaluation in the office, B.D. appears active and well hydrated. No evidence of bacterial infection is present on physical examination and the diagnosis is made of viral upper respiratory tract infection. B.D. improves slightly during the following weeks, but then his older brother develops a cold. B.D. begins to cough more regularly at night and becomes somewhat more irritable. It is decided to reevaluate B.D. for his prolonged symptoms. At the time of reevaluation, B.D. still looks good. His nasal mucosa is mildly erythematous with bilateral clear discharge. He is active and playful. No evidence of inspiratory stridor, expiratory wheezing, or otitis media is found on physical examination. L.D. is upset. Her cousin's child has just been diagnosed with pneumonia, and L.D. is concerned that her son may develop this condition. She requests further diagnostic testing. Because the illness has lingered for 3 weeks, it is decided to perform a complete blood count, chest radiograph, and place a PPD. The hematocrit is 35%, and the white blood cell count is 7.8 mm3 with a normal differential. The chest radiograph is clear. Two days later, B.D. returns to the office for an evaluation of his PPD. His skin test is negative. He is active, alert, and no longer coughing.",

What types of signs and symptoms should we encourage parents to look for to distinguish complicated from uncomplicated colds? When and what types of tests are appropriate for evaluation of the persistent cough? Chronic cough can be defined as a persistent cough of more than 3-weeks duration. There are many causes, and most should be considered based on age of the child. Although the more common sources of chronic cough are to be stressed, the less common sources are not to be ignored. Infants are more likely to suffer with congenital malformations leading to chronic cough. Toddlers are prone to aspirate foreign bodies. School-aged children may present with signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis or even cystic fibrosis. Adolescents may expose themselves to inhaled irritants such as tobacco or glue. The presence of psychogenic cough is also more prevalent in adolescents.",

            "text": "The common cold is the most common reason that patients visit physicians. More lost school days occur because of the common cold than all other causes combined. The common cold is the most frequent upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Wald et al 20 studied the usual duration of community-acquired viral URI and the incidence of complications (otitis media/sinusitis) of these URI in infancy and early childhood. Children in daycare were found to be more likely to have protracted respiratory symptoms than children in home care. The mean duration for a single URI ranged from approximately 7 days (for 1-2 year olds in home care) to approximately 9 days (for children younger than 1 year old in daycare). The percentage of simple URIs lasting more than 15 days ranged from 6.5% (for 1-year-old to 3-year-old children in home care) to 13.1% (for 2-year-old to 3-year-old children in daycare). Symptoms of the common cold include sneezing, rhinorrhea, cough, mild sore throat, congestion, low-grade fever, and malaise. Acetaminophen, oral fluids, rest, and saline nose drops with gentle suction are the only treatments generally recognized as safe and partially effective. Symptoms usually abate in 5 to 7 days. When a child begins to recover and develops localized pain such as earache, chest, throat or facial pain, increased irritability or lethargy, decreased oral intake, high fever, a new purulent nasal discharge, difficulty breathing, or night and day cough, complications such as pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis or lower respiratory tract infection should be suspected. The real challenge is to distinguish between recurrent or persistent colds that need more time and complications that require medical intervention.",

A cough producing thick, tenacious sputum may be associated with cystic fibrosis. A dry, brassy, or stridorous cough may be associated with upper airway disease caused by foreign body aspiration, laryngitis, or laryngotracheobronchitis (croup). Paroxysms of cough are found in pertussis, cystic fibrosis, and foreign body aspiration. A paroxysm of cough followed by a whoop is the classic presentation of whooping cough caused by B. pertussis. The whoop rarely is seen in infants. A productive throat clearing indicates a postnasal drip associated with sinusitis. The staccato cough is associated with chlamydia pneumonia. A psychogenic cough that usually presents as dry and brassy may be bizarre, with a honking or barking quality. A cough associated with a wheeze is likely caused by asthma (Table 1)\n",

Because children average six to eight colds per year, sinusitis is a common condition in primary care. Sinusitis typically presents with a nasal discharge of any quality (thin to thick and clear to purulent). The cough usually is present by day but is usually worse at night. Halitosis (bad breath) may be present. Facial pain and headache are useful indicators only after the age of about 10 to 12. Painless morning eye swelling may be noted by the parent in the school-aged population. Fever, if present, is usually low grade.14\n",

Looking carefully for signs and symptoms of serious disease (see list), recognizing that the age of the patient is associated with specific types of chronic cough (see Table 1), and understanding the character of the cough and its cause affect management decisions. By considering these three factors in addition to a thorough history and physical examination, many expensive, low-yield laboratory tests can be avoided. Although cost-effective, this approach must be combined with a skillful exploration of the parents' concerns and needs.",

An older child may be able to perform a peak expiratory flow in the office to further assess bronchospasm in addition to pre\u2013 and post\u2013bronchodilator therapy. It is important to counsel patients concerning the proper use of the inhalers and the correct dose before a decision is made to abandon this line of therapy. If the patient responds equivocally or partially to bronchodilator, a short course of high dose oral corticosteroid should be given. This is the patient who will benefit from chronic anti-inflammatory therapy. Sinus radiographs have significant false-positive and false-negative results in the presence of simple URIs and documented sinusitis. If sinusitis is expected clinically, a course of antibiotics should be administered.14 Forty percent of sinusitis clears spontaneously, however. A frank discussion with the parents concerning the value of antibiotics in this setting is generally prudent. MR imaging, rhinoscopy, ultrasound, and CT scans are not likely to be useful. A history of recurrent sinusitis and pneumonia should lead to a nasal biopsy to rule out immotile cilia syndrome.",
