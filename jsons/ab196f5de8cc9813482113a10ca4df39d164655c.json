We analyzed the RBD of RmYN02, RaTG13, and the two pangolin beta-126 CoVs using homology modelling (Fig. 2a-2f and Extended Data Figure 4 for sequence 7 alignment). The amino acid deletions in RmYN02 RBD made two loops near the receptor 128 binding site that are shorter than those in HCoV-19 RBD (Fig. 2a and 2f) . Importantly, the 129 conserved disulfide bond in the external subdomain of SARS-CoV (PDB: 2DD8) 12 , HCoV-19 130 (PDB: 6LZG), RaTG13 (Fig. 2b) , pangolin/MP789/2019 (Fig. 2c) and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017 131 (Fig. 2d) was missing in RmYN02 (Fig. 2f) . We speculate that these deletions may cause 132 conformational variations and consequently reduce the binding of RmYN02 RBD with ACE2 133 or even cause non-binding. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions, 134 including RmYN02, ZXC21 and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor. In contrast, RaTG13 135 The S protein of CoVs is functionally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 15 in a similar manner 151 to the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The insertion of polybasic 152 amino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is associated with enhanced 153 pathogenicity 16, 17 . Notably, HCoV-19 is characterized by a four-amino-acid-insertion at the 154 junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs 18 . This insertion, which 155 represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to HCoV-19 and is present in all HCoV-156 19 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in 157 RmYN02 ( Fig. 2h and Extended Data Figure 2 ) is therefore of major importance. Although the 158 inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence 159 are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats) 160 strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by recombination. 161",

From this, we generated two 97 preliminary consensus sequences. Pool 39 comprised 11 feces from Rhinolophus malayanus 98 collected between May 6 and July 30, 2019. After a series of verification steps, including re-99 mapping and Sanger sequencing (Extended DataTable 2andFigures 1-3), one partial (23395 100 bp) and one complete (29671 bp) beta-CoV genome sequences were obtained and RmYN02), respectively.

Indeed, the pangolin/MP789/2019 139 virus showed highly structural homology with HCoV-19 (Fig. 2e). 140 141 Six amino acid residues at the RBD (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505) have been 142 reported to be major determinants of efficient receptor binding of HCoV-, and consistent with the homology modelling, pangolin/MP789/2019 possessed 144 the identical amino acid residues to HCoV-19 at all six positions 7 . In contrast, both RaTG13, 145 RmYN02 and RmYN01 possessed the same amino acid residue as HCoV-19 at only one of 146 the six positions each (RaTG13, L455; RmYN02, Y505; RmYN01, Y505) (Fig. 2g), despite 147 RaTG13 being the closest relative in the spike protein.

Both 184 Rhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely distributed in southwest China 185 and southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highly 186 gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate the 187 exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. Notably, RaTG13 188 was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, but 189 feasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can on the currently available data we propose that HCoV-19 likely originates from multiple 193 10 naturally occurring recombination events in wildlife. A virus from bats likely provides the 194 genetic backbone of HCoV-19, with further recombination events with bats and perhaps 195 other wildlife species resulting in the acquisition of the Spike protein, RBD and the polybasic 196 cleavage site. Similar recombination events have been also implicated in the origin of SARSit is clear that a far wider sampling of wildlife will be required to reveal the 198 exact species involved and the exact series of recombination events. 199 200",

Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from 42 multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and 43 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are common viral respiratory pathogens that primarily cause symptoms 47 in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In 1960s, two CoVs, 229E and OC43, were 48 identified in clinical samples from patients experiencing the common cold 3 . More recently, 49 four additional human CoVs have been successively identified: severe acute respiratory 50 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, NL63 in late 2004, HKU1 in January 2005, and 51 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. However, only two 52 betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are able to cause severe and fatal 53infections, leading to 774 and 858 deaths, respectively, suggesting that beta-CoVs may be of 54 particular concern to human health. In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by an 55 unidentified microbial agent was reported, which was soon identified to be a novel 56 deaths in China. By the end of January confirmed HCoV-19 cases were present in all the 61Chinese provinces and municipalities and at the time of writing the virus has been detected 62 An epidemiological survey of several HCoV-19 cases at an early stage of the outbreak 65 revealed that most had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city prior to illness, 66 identified from a Rhinolophus affinis bat sampled in Yunnan province in 2013 2 . This virus 70 shared 96.1% nucleotide identity and 92.9% identity in the S gene, again suggesting that bats 71 play a key role as coronavirus reservoirs 2 . Notably, however, two research groups recently 72 reported several novel beta-CoVs related to HCoV-19 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) . Although these pangolins CoVs are more distant to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 across 75 the virus genome as a whole, they are very similar to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain 76 (RBD) of the S protein, including at the amino acid residues thought to mediate binding to 77 ACE2 8 . It is therefore possible that pangolins play an important role in the ecology and 78 evolution of CoVs, although whether they act as intermediate hosts for HCoV-19 is currently 79 unclear. Indeed, the discovery of viruses in pangolins suggests that there is a wide diversity 80 of CoVs still to be sampled in wildlife, some of which may be directly involved in the 81 Between May and October, 2019, we collected a total of 302 samples from 227 bats from 84 Mengla County, Yunnan Province in southern China (Extended Data Table 1). These bats 85 belonged to 20 different species, with the majority of samples from Rhinolophus malayanus 86 (n=48, 21.1%), Hipposideros larvatus (n=41, 18.1%) and Rhinolophus stheno (n=39, 17.2%).
