HAV has several unique biological characteristics that distinguish it from other members of this family. Recent and previous studies revealed that codon usage plays a key role in HAV replication and evolution. In this study, the patterns of synonymous codon usage in HAV have been studied through multivariate statistical methods on 30 complete open reading frames (ORFs) from the available 30 full-length HAV sequences. Effective number of codons (ENC) indicates that the overall extent of codon usage bias in HAV genomes is significant. The relative dinucleotide abundances suggest that codon usage in HAV can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies. These factors strongly correlated with the first major axis of correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU). The distribution of the HAV ORFs along the plane defined by the first two major axes in COA showed that different genotypes are located at different places in the plane, suggesting that HAV codon usage is also reflecting an evolutionary process. It has been very recently described that fine-tuning translation kinetics selection also contributes to codon usage bias of HAV.

Once aligned, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of each codon were determined in order to measure the synonymous codon usage (Sharp and Li, 1986b) . This was done using the CodonW program (available at: http://mobyle.pasteur.fr). The RSCU is the observed frequency of a codon divided by the frequency expected, if all synonymous codons for that amino acid were used equally. If RSCU value is close to 1.0, it indicates a lack of bias (Tsai et al., 2007) . RSCU values are largely independent of amino acid composition and are particularly useful in comparing codon usage between genes that differ in size and amino acid composition. The RSCU of HAV ORFs were compared with corresponding values of human cells (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001). The effective number of codons (ENC) and the frequency of use of GC 3 S (G+C at synonymous variable third position codons, excluding Met, Trp, and termination codons) were also calculated by the use of the Codon W program. ENC was used to quantify the codon usage bias of an ORF (Wrigth, 1990) , which is one of the best overall estimator of absolute synonymous codon usage bias (Comeron and Aguade, 1998) . The ENC values range from 20 to 61. The larger the extent of codon bias in a gene, the smaller the ENC value is. In an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid, this value would be 20; in an unbiased gene, it would be 61. Similarly, the fraction of the G+C nucleotides not involved in the GC 3 S fraction (GC 12 ) was also calculated. All these indices were also calculated using the Codon W program.

In these cases, competition is avoided by the induction of cellular shutoff of protein synthesis through carboxy cleavage of translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) by 2A and L proteases, respectively (Racaniello, 2001) .

Moreover, HAV has a very inefficient IRES (Whetter et al., 1994) .

All CpG containing codons are markedly suppressed (Table 3) in the 30 HAV strains included in the study, confirming what has been very recently noted . Marked CpG deficiency has been also observed in Coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2007) , vertebrate-infecting members of the family Flaviviridae (Lobo et al., 2009) , Poliovirus (Rothberg and Wimmer, 1981) and other RNA viruses (Karlin et al., 1994) . Moreover, polioviruses synthetically deoptimized either by codon deoptimization or codon pair deoptimization are generally marked by a higher content of CpG (and also UpA) dinucleotide (Burns et al., 2006 (Burns et al., , 2009 Mueller et al., 2006; Coleman et al., 2008) , indicating that polioviruses have naturally evolved to eliminate these dinucleotides. CpG deficiency was proposed to be related to the immunostimulatory properties of unmethylated CpG, which were recognized by the host's innate immune system as a pathogen signature (Shackelton et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2007) . Escaping from the host antiviral response may act as another selective pressure contributing to the multifactorial codon usage shaping (Vetsigian and Goldenfeld, 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 625, "text": "(Woo et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 684, "end": 703, "text": "(Lobo et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 717, "end": 744, "text": "(Rothberg and Wimmer, 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 767, "end": 788, "text": "(Karlin et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 976, "end": 995, "text": "(Burns et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1017, "text": "(Burns et al., , 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1039, "text": "Mueller et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1061, "text": "Coleman et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1355, "text": "(Shackelton et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1373, "text": "Woo et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1542, "text": "(Vetsigian and Goldenfeld, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 161, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 263, "end": 272, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 443, "end": 452, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "and Supplementary"}, {"text": "Thus, the results of these studies suggest that HAV genomic biases are the result from the coevolution of genome composition, the need to a controlled translation kinetics and probably the need to escape the antiviral cell responses, and thus is a model in agreement with the evolution rhetoric theory proposed by Vetsigian and Goldenfeld (2009) in which genome biases emerge by the need to increase communication with the ever changing cell environment without changing the message.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 345, "text": "Vetsigian and Goldenfeld (2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "and Supplementary"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Genomic analysis of Influenza A viruses, including Avian Flu (H5N1) strains", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Ahn", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Jeong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Bae", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Jung", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Son", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Eur.
