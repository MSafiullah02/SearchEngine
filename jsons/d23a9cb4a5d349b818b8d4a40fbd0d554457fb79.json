For the majority of studied real-world networks, the portion of vertices of degree d was observed to decrease as d \u2212\u03b3 , usually with 2 < \u03b3 < 3 [5, 23, 45] . Such networks are often called scale-free. The most well-known approach to the modeling of scale-free networks is called preferential attachment. The main idea of this approach is that new vertices emerging in a graph connect to some already existing vertices chosen with probabilities proportional to their degrees. Preferential attachment is a natural process allowing to obtain a graph with a power-law degree distribution, and many random graph models are based on this idea, see, e.g., [11, 14, 28, 33, 56] .",

In particular, it was observed that the cumulative community size distribution obeys a power law with some parameter \u03bb. For instance, [16] reports that \u03bb = 1 for some networks; [3] obtains either \u03bb = 0.5 or \u03bb = 1; [27] also observes a power law with \u03bb close to 0.5 in some range of cluster sizes; [48] studies the overlapping communities and shows that \u03bb is ranging between 1 and 1. 6 .",

Our approach is called preferential placement and it is based on the idea that vertices can be embedded in a multidimensional space of latent features. The vertices appear one by one and their positions are defined according to preferential placement: new vertices are more likely to fall into already dense regions. We present a detailed description of this process in Section 2. After n steps we obtain a set of n vertices placed in a multidimensional space. In Section 3 we empirically and theoretically analyze the obtained structure: in particular, we show that the communities are clearly visible and their sizes are distributed according to a power law. Note that after the placement of all vertices is defined, one can easily construct an underlying network, using, e.g., the threshold model [13, 39] . We discuss possible models and their properties in Section 4. This paper is a journal version of [20] . It contains additional theoretical and empirical results for the vertex configuration obtained by preferential placement. We also discuss some new ideas on generating graphs from this configuration and analyze the diameter of such graphs.",

We call the described above procedure \"preferential placement\" due to its analogy with preferential attachment. Assume that at some step of the algorithm we have several clusters, i.e., groups of vertices located close to each other, and a new vertex appears. Then the probability that this vertex will join a cluster C is roughly proportional to its size, i.e., the number of vertices already belonging to this cluster. This is the basic intuition which we discuss further in this paper in more details.",

Uniform random recursive tree (or URRT) is a tree sampled from the set of recursive trees of order n uniformly at random. An equivalent way to sample a URRT is to start from a graph T 1 consisting of a root vertex v 1 and at each step t + 1 add a vertex v t+1 connected to a vertex v i t+1 chosen from v 1 , . . . , v t uniformly at random.

The results are presented on Figures 1 and 2 . The value \u03b2 = 0.5 produces the heaviest tail, in this case the distribution \u039e does not have a finite expectation. Although some clusters are clearly visible in this case (Figure 1a ), they are located far apart from each other and there are too many single outliers far away from the main picture, which seems to be not very realistic. Note that for too large \u03b2, e.g., for \u03b2 = 4, the variance is too low and we obtain only one giant cluster with minor fluctuations, as presented on Figure 1d . Further in this paper we discuss the case \u03b2 = 1.5 presented on Figure 2 . In this case \u039e has a finite expectation but an infinite variance. Another interesting observation is a hierarchical clustering structure produced by our algorithm. To illustrate this, we take the figure obtained for \u03b2 = 1.5 and zoom it to see more details. Figure 2 shows that the largest cluster further consists of several subclusters. In order to further analyze this self-similarity property we empirically estimated a fractal dimension of the obtained structures [32] . We used a box-counting algorithm 1 which computes the number of boxes N (\u03b5) with the edge size equal to \u03b5 needed to cover the structure. Then the fractal dimension d f is defined using the following relation: N (\u03b5) \u221d \u03b5 \u2212d f . The results are presented on Figure 3 (crosses represent the empirically observed pairs (\u03b5, N (\u03b5)), while lines correspond to the approximations N (\u03b5) \u221d \u03b5 \u2212d f ). One can see that the fractal dimension d f increases from 0.4 to 1.3 while \u03b2 increases from 0.5 to 4. Note that the fractal dimension of L\u00e9vy flights is also known to monotonically increase with the parameter of the power-law distribution [36] . ",

The algorithm is parametrized only by a distribution \u039e, and if \u039e is a Pareto distribution, which is the most natural choice, then we essentially have only one parameter -the exponent \u03b2. The proposed algorithm naturally models clusters and the distribution of cluster sizes follows a power law, which is a desirable property. Although preferential placement only generates the coordinates of vertices, one can easily construct a graph based on the obtained structure using one of the methods discussed in this paper. We showed that applying a genealogical-based variant of a threshold model to the configuration generated by preferential placement leads to a realistic degree distribution and small diameter. In this paper, we made only a first step to understanding the cluster formation in complex structures and there are many directions for future research. First of all, more formal analysis of the distribution of cluster sizes would be useful. As we discussed, the main problem here is the lack of any suitable formal definition of clusters. However, one can try, e.g., to analyze clusters produced by one of well-known clustering algorithms. Second, the radius of obtained configuration can be deeper analyzed: e.g., we are going to study the lower bound for X \u03b4 (n) and the upper bound for X max (n) (see Section 3.4). Finally, there are many open questions in the analysis of the obtained graph structures: comparison of different models, theoretical analysis of the degree distribution, analysis of the local clustering coefficient, and so on. Now we introduce the following variables",

Consider the case \u03b1 = 0, i.e., p(n) = c. Let us prove that in this casewhere \u03b8 n,s \u2264 C s 1 1\u2212c for some constant C > 0. We prove this result by induction on s and for each s the proof is by induction on n. Note that for n = 1 Equation (4) holds for all s. Consider now the case s = 1. We want to prove that EF n (1) = c 2 \u2212 c (n + \u03b8 n,1 ) .For the inductive step we use Equation (2) and getFor s > 1 we use Equation (3) and getTo finish the proof we need to show thatIt is easy to show that the above inequality holds.Now we consider the case p(n) = cn \u2212\u03b1 for 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1. Let us prove that in this casewhere \u03b8 n,s \u2264 Cn max{0,1\u22122\u03b1} s 1\u2212\u03b1+ for some constant C > 0 and for any > 0. The proof is similar to the case \u03b1 = 0. Again, for n = 1 the theorem holds. Consider s = 1. We want to prove that EF n (1) = c 2 \u2212 \u03b1 n 1\u2212\u03b1 + \u03b8 n,1 .Inductive step in this case becomesIn order to finish the proof for the case s = 1 it is sufficient to show thatwhich holds for sufficiently large C.For s > 1 we have:In order to finish the proof, it remains to show that,1\u22122\u03b1} s 1\u2212\u03b1+ , which holds for sufficiently large C.",
