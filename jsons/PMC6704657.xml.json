In the last 15 years alone, the total number of mammal species has grown by fully 20%, while the accumulation of new bat species (26.4%), especially in tropical regions, has grown even faster [2, 3]. The discovery of new bat species in the Afrotropics (Africa south of the Sahara, including Madagascar and continental shelf islands) has paralleled these global trends, buoyed by continuing geographic and taxonomic surveys of bats across the region, a growing number of systematic investigations using molecular phylogenetic and integrative taxonomic approaches, and the use of more powerful and objective means of assessing species boundaries. The species limits of morphologically conservative or cryptic lineages of bats have been greatly clarified by an integrative approach using multi-locus genetic delimitation methods as a starting point for identifying candidate species and then testing them using additional, corroborative data from behavioral, morphological, distributional, and/or ecological information ([4], cf. [5]). New species have also come to light via collecting in previously unsampled regions and through genetic analysis of ancient DNA using new methods [6\u20139].",

            "text": "Coalescent species delimitation methods incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty in gene trees and jointly infer species limits and species phylogenies. They have been shown to be conservative in that high delimitation posterior probabilities are consistent indicators of species status ([15] and references therein). Briefly, methods such as the software BPP [15, 16] infer statistical support for genetic isolation on an evolutionary timescale. However, species delimitation based exclusively on molecular data is controversial. It has been shown that multispecies multilocus coalescent delimitation methods can confound species-level and population-level processes and delimit population structure rather than species when the speciation process is protracted ([17] but see also, [18, 19]). However these debates on the status of delimited lineages are resolved, the multispecies coalescent remains a powerful method for inferring the evolutionary independence of lineages that can be subsequently tested with independent data (e.g., morphology, and bioacoustics data in bats) to assess species status in an integrative taxonomy [4]. In this study we carry out lineage delimitation as a foundation for subsequent taxonomic revisions (see [20]). We do not claim that lineages distinguished by our analyses substantiate the boundaries of species; for this reason, we do not formally name these delimited lineages pending integrative taxonomic revision.",

Lineages for which we were unable to assign confident names (here considered putative species) are considered hypotheses for later testing via integrative taxonomy. More than half of the sequence data used in this study are newly generated, extending the multi-locus analysis of Dool et al. [6] with substantial new material obtained in bat surveys of western, central, eastern, and southern Africa. Our expanded geographic, taxonomic, and population level sampling enables a more robust assessment of phylogenetic relationships and population structure among Afrotropical Rhinolophus. The intron data set used here has strong advantages over using mitochondrial loci alone and offers independent representation of the nuclear genome as each of the four introns are found on different chromosomes [6]. Incorporating independent genomic regions into phylogenetic analysis of this monogeneric family [21, 22] and assessment of species relationships and limits is crucial because several instances of mitochondrial introgression have been documented within Rhinolophidae [6, 23\u201325]. Other instances of possible mitochondrial introgression were investigated via comparisons between our intron phylogenies and those generated with mitochondrial sequences. Finally, using our well resolved nuclear gene tree and species tree, we assess support for broad biogeographic patterns in a comparative context to studies of other Afrotropical bats [13, 20, 22, 26, 27].",

No animals were collected in this study; all tissues were parts of permanent research collections. Tissue samples available from Kenya and Tanzania was especially dense (Fig. 2). Initial assignments to species were based on the bats of East Africa key in [26]. An additional 173 cytochrome-b (cyt-b) sequences and 122 nuclear intron sequences for each of the introns ACOX2, COPS7A, ROGDI, and STAT5A of Rhinolophus were downloaded from GenBank from a total of 210 individuals. A species in the recently resurrected genus Macronycteris [28], M. vittatus (Hipposideridae) was used as an outgroup. In total, 423 individuals with 1\u20135 genes were analyzed for our study (see Additional file 1 for voucher numbers, locality data, and GenBank accession numbers).",

This analysis was carried out to guide future investigations of the lineages inferred here, using an integrative species taxonomic approach to include fixed differences in phenotypic characters, acoustics, ectoparasitic associations, and geographic distributions. BPP analyses were carried on those populations obtained from the concatenated gene-tree analyses and were identical to specimens assigned to lineages in the species-tree analyses. Each population was designated as a putative independent lineage to be evaluated under the multi-species coalescent model [14 and references therein]. Separate analyses were carried out for lineages within each of four different Rhinolophus species groups: capensis group, six lineages; ferrumequinum group, six lineages; fumigatus/eloquens group, eight lineages; and landeri group, four lineages. The validity of our assignment of specimens to populations was tested using the guide-tree-free algorithm (A11) in BPP. Two replicates were run for each of four different combinations of priors on divergence depth and effective population sizes (\u03c4 and \u03b8, respectively; Table 1), as the probability of delimitation by BPP is sensitive to these two parameters [16, 46]. All BPP analyses were run for 5 \u00d7 104 generations, with a burn-in of 104 generations and samples drawn every 50th generation. In total, eight BPP runs were carried out for each of the aforementioned species groups using nuclear intron loci (n = 4).

Moreover, they are not reciprocally monophyletic and likewise would render R. simulator paraphyletic [cf. 12, where R. gorongosae is 7.3% cyt-b distant from R. simulator; also see Fig. 1, Supplemental Material]. We resequenced a specimen assigned to R. landeri by Taylor et al.

Finally, a monophyletic clade of three specimens from three separate countries in the Central African Guineo-Congolian rainforest region (cf. denti) was unexpectedly inferred as nested within the capensis group, otherwise distributed in eastern and southern Africa.

In contrast to the concatenated analysis, R. alcyone is poorly supported as sister to R. lobatus + R. cf. landeri clade.

The clades labeled simulator 1 and simulator 2 in the species tree analysis (Fig. 5) have largely overlapping distributions although simulator 1 also includes specimens from DRC and Gabon that were provisionally assigned to R. cf. denti in the cyt-b gene tree (Fig. 3). The enigmatic placement of these Guineo-Congolian rainforest [48] specimens within R. simulator 1, otherwise distributed in savanna/woodland, warrants further investigation.",

Multiple phylogenetic studies have confirmed the monophyly of Rhinolophus and the Rhinolophidae [20, 51, 52]. Csorba et al. [13] presented a phylogenetic hypothesis for the monophyly of African Rhinolophus, with R. blasii and R. clivosus extending from the Afrotropics to the Western Palearctic, and R. euryale, R. ferrumequinum, and R. hipposideros having distributions in both North Africa and the Western Palearctic. Several studies have placed the most recent common ancestor of Rhinolophus at ~ 40 Mya [53, 54]; cf. ([22], at 34 Mya). It has long been considered that Rhinolophidae originated in the African or Asian tropics, although Csorba et al. [13] presented data supporting a European origin of the family when tropical conditions prevailed in southern Europe during the Miocene. However, Dool et al. [6] argued instead for a Middle Eastern origin for the basal lineage R. hipposideros. Owing to poor resolution of basal nodes in their multi-locus phylogeny [6], they refrained from speculating on the ancestral origin of Rhinolophidae but, did find support for accelerated diversification within Afrotropical Rhinolophus over the last 6 Mya. Subsequently, the new species R. xinanzhongguoensis, described from southwestern China [47], was strongly supported as having affinities to the ferrumequinum, fumigatus, and maclaudi groups.",

Both of these Eurasian species are closer to the endemic African groups fumigatus and maclaudi than to the endemic Afrotropical capensis and landeri groups. Thus, the membership of R. xinanzhongguoensis and R. nippon in a predominantly African clade seems to indicate a complex historical biogeographical relationship between the Afrotropics and Eastern Eurasia, possibly supporting additional dispersal events between the continents.

We also sequenced members of nine clades represented in their study with samples from new Afrotropical localities. Our expanded data set is the largest yet for Afrotropical Rhinolophus, and infers support for up to 23 independent evolutionary lineages as candidate species for future assessment with corroborative data. Results from coalescent delimitation and species tree analysis suggest three named species may be synonyms (R. kahuzi and either R. gorongosae or R. rhodesiae).

[12] recently argued for species status for two African Rhinolophus names long regarded as synonyms: R. lobatus (Peters, 1852) from R. landeri and R. rhodesiae (Roberts, 1946) from R. swinnyi. They described the new species R. gorongosae on the basis of integrative data that included a suite of morphological variables, but their molecular phylogenetic analyses relied solely on cytochrome-b. Their putative R. gorongosae (DM14815, DM14843) had anomalously long branches (p-distance 7.3 and 7.2% from R. simulator and putative R. rhodesiae, respectively; see their Fig. 2) and nested within R. simulator, which motivated us to re-examine these deeply diverged specimens. In addition, the sister relationship they determined of R. landeri and R. gorongosae (15% p-distance), instead of with alcyone and lobatus [other members of the landeri group; 13], led us to compare this sequence to GenBank accessions using BLASTn. The BLASTn query showed 100% identity of their R. landeri (GenBank accession MG980682, DM12953, Liberia) with Bos taurus. When tissue from this voucher specimen and another (DM12622), also from Liberia, was extracted and new sequence data generated, those individuals were found to nest deeply within the R. blasii clade 1 (Additional file 4). We extracted and sequenced five samples identified as R. gorongosae from the Durban Museum, including DM14815 from [12], and found them to be 1\u20131.4% cyt-b diverged from R. simulator and R. rhodesiae. This strongly suggests that the genetic arguments in [12] for the newly described R. gorongosae and for elevation of R. swinnyi rhodesiae to species rank were based on sequencing error (see Additional file 5 for comparison of GenBank sequences versus newly sequenced material).",

[24, 25], and the R. macrotis species complex in China [55]. Potential mitochondrial introgression is apparent in our study in the cyt-b gene tree for ferrumequinum clades 1 and 2 and clivosus clade 2 as discussed in [6]. Taylor et al. [12] suggested historical genetic introgression might account for the discrepancy between the morphological disparity of R. simulator and R. rhodesiae and their lack of genetic differentiation (0.6%). However, they did not test this hypothesis with genetic data. In this study, mitochondrial, concatenated nuclear loci, and the species tree (also inferred with nuclear data only) all strongly infer the very close relationship of R. rhodesiae to R. simulator clade 1. Although the cyt-b tree recovers both gorongosae and rhodesiae as paraphyletic, the concatenated nuclear phylogeny recovers them in two separate monophyletic clades (simulator 1 and 2; Fig. 4). To understand these conflicting signals, and to determine which of these clades actually represents true R. simulator, a geographically expanded integrative taxonomic assessment will be necessary.",

In the capensis group, a clade from Cameroon (ROM 68963), Gabon (FMNH 167770), and western DRC (FMNH 219476) is strongly supported in the cyt-b gene tree (Fig. 3) as sister to R. denti, otherwise known from savanna and woodlands of southern (R. denti) and western (R. denti knorri) Africa. The specimens from DRC and Gabon were included in the concatenated nuclear intron tree and found to nest well within R. simulator, which is sister to R. denti. Rhinolophus alcyone alticolus Sanborn, 1936 [56] was allocated to R. simulator by Koopman [57], who was followed by subsequent authors, but Csorba et al. [13] suggested that R. simulator alticolus might prove to be a separate species. The type specimen (which is now lost) was from Mt. Cameroon, and western Cameroon is the only lowland rainforest distribution for the savanna woodland simulator [13]. The specimen we sequenced from Mt. Cameroon was from a ~ 50-year-old skin and nuclear genes were not successfully amplified. Nonetheless, the strong support for the DRC and Gabon specimens (from the same clade as the Mt. Cameroon specimen in the cyt-b tree) with R. simulator suggests that our cf. denti clade may be introgressed R. simulator whose range now extends well into the western African rainforest habitat [48]. Independent nuclear data from additional specimens are needed to confirm the status of this clade. Also within the capensis group, all analyses in our study strongly support the existence of an undescribed species provisionally designated cf. denti/simulator. At present, populations are known from Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi where they are sympatric with its close relative R. simulator and presumably differ from it ecologically.",

The genus is interesting from a public health standpoint owing to various associated viral pathogens [53, 59\u201361]. Its constant-frequency echolocation calls have been widely studied for their value in communication [62, 63], adaptation and speciation [64\u201366], and resource subdivision [67, 68]. Their noseleaves, cranial morphology, dentition, and bacula are all richly diversified morphological systems [13, 69] hardly studied from developmental or evolutionary perspectives. Continued efforts to characterize these newly documented lineages across all of these phenotypic dimensions will offer greater understanding of their evolutionary development and diversification.",
