            "text": "The contribution offers a novel understanding on the adoption and potential use of serious games in corporate business environments. Serious games use the artistic medium of games to deliver a message, teach a lesson, or provide an experience. A serious game is an \u201cinteractive computer application, with or without significant hardware component that has a challenging goal, is fun to play and engaging, incorporates some scoring mechanism, and supplies the user with skills, knowledge or attitudes useful in reality\u201d (Bergeron 2006). Studies abound that show the application of serious games in the entertainment, military, healthcare, and education sectors (Levin 2010; Smith 2007; Zyda 2005). However, there are limited studies on the application within the corporate sector. The field of serious games is relatively new and therefore, limited research has been conducted in this area (Azadegan et al. 2012; Levin 2010). Few studies exist about the application of serious games in the South African business context. Therefore, the study serves to raise corporate awareness of serious games and the potential applications in the context of South Africa business.",

            "text": "Serious games involve a broader spectrum of uses than Digital Game-Based Learning (Breuer and Bente 2010; Connolly et al. 2012; Michael and Chen 2006). DGBL is a term used in the domain of education as it involves the use of digital games primarily for learning purposes (Breuer and Bente 2010; Susi et al. 2007). Serious gaming relates to the concepts of virtual worlds and DGBL (Connolly et al. 2012; Susi et al. 2007). DGBL found in education involves applying digital games primarily for learning purposes (Breuer and Bente 2010; Susi et al. 2007). Virtual worlds are \u201ccomputer-simulated, usually 3-D, representations that allow avatars to interconnect and communicate in relatively lifelike environments\u201d (Ives and Junglas 2008). These environments persist; continue to exist and undergo changes even when players are not present (Cox 2000; Ives and Junglas 2008). Serious games have their own virtual world in which players play the game (Breuer and Bente 2010; Levin 2010). Serious games can be divided into two broad categories: commercial off the shelf (COTS) games, and games developed specifically for educational or corporate purposes (Azadegan and Riedel 2012; Graafland et al. 2012). COTS involves re-purposing an existing game to harness the power of serious games without the risk and expense of developing a bespoke serious game that may not be sufficiently engaging (Connolly et al. 2012). Both categories of serious games are included in this study.",

            "text": "Training conducted with serious games, especially in simulated environments is prevalent (Michael and Chen 2006; Susi et al. 2007). Games offer a simulated environment in which training exercises can be performed, much like real-life training simulations (Graafland et al. 2012; Susi et al. 2007). There are benefits of using serious games over traditional forms of training. Serious games present a safe environment for performing training (Graafland et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2012). The simulation of a real life activity allows skills to be fine-tuned through practice in a risk-free environment without consequence (Graafland et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2012). Serious games can also be deployed as a collaborative platform among multiple people (Bozanta et al. 2012; Fernandes et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2012). Using the internet as a communication medium enables serious games to provide Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) in the form of virtual worlds (Bozanta et al. 2012). The MUVEs provide a virtual environment that players can communicate and collaborate to jointly achieve their goals (Fernandes et al. 2012). Collaboration enables people in different locations to collaborate effectively without needing to travel or for expensive teleconferencing technologies to be purchased (Bozanta et al. 2012; Fernandes et al. 2012; Levin 2010). Serious games are also employed for demonstrations and education (Herrlich 2007; Levin 2010). Serious games provide unique immersive environments that teach complex material (Susi et al. 2007). Serious games aid marketing and performing demonstrations of products or services (Herrlich 2007; Levin 2010). COTS games have been suitable for this purpose because of their low cost, fast implementation, and high level of engagement (\u201cflow\u201d) (Herrlich 2007; Rankin and Shute 2010).",

Companies which are unaware of serious games will not adopt them, and those which are aware of the concept, but not of the benefits are equally unlikely to adopt serious games (Azadegan et al. 2012). Perceptions of employees and managers towards games heavily influence the likelihood of adoption (Azadegan et al. 2012; Ives and Junglas 2008). Games perceived as easy and not contributing to training or promoting the company\u2019s purpose, will not be adopted (Azadegan et al. 2012; Ives and Junglas 2008). Based on the work by Azadegan et al. (2012) in the area of serious game adoption in businesses, four categories of barriers are identified: barriers with familiarity about serious games (familiarity barriers), financial barriers, barriers in terms of the practicality of serious games (practicality barriers), and the level of Information Technology facilities and support (IT facilities and support barriers) (Azadegan et al. 2012).",
