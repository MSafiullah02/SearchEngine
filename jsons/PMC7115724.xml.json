This airflow obstruction is generally progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyperreactivity, and often is partially reversible.7 Declining lung function is almost universally caused by decades of tobacco smoke exposure and develops insidiously so that patients often do not complain of exertional dyspnea until their 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is between 40% and 59% of its predicted value.20 When the FEV1 falls below 1 L, patients are disabled in the activities of daily living and have a 5-year survival of approximately 50%.3 Forced expiratory volume in 1 second declines by about 30 mL/year in healthy nonsmokers, whereas the average decline is approximately 45 mL/year in smokers.20 Approximately 15% of smokers are susceptible to the airway effects of smoking and will develop COPD. These patients show accelerated rates of decline in FEV1 of between 50 and 90 mL/year.24\n",

With the movement of large numbers of neutrophils and their subsequent release of proteases and toxic oxygen radicals, epithelial surface damage may be enhanced. After the inciting impact of smoking, bacterial colonization therefore begets airway damage which, in turn, begets further inflammation and bacterial colonization.

A variety of infectious and noninfectious insults result in inflammation, bronchospasm, and mucous hypersecretion. These lead to acute airway narrowing that aggravates ventilation-perfusion (/) mismatching and can worsen existing hyperinflation. Although / inequality is the most important determinant of hypoxemia, low mixed venous oxygen tension (Pvo\n2) is a contributing factor.16 During exacerbations, the work of breathing increases to overcome increased airway resistance and dynamic hyperinflation. Oxygen utilization by the respiratory muscles therefore is markedly increased, resulting in lower Pvo\n2. Fortunately, among patients with adequate cardiac reserve, increases in cardiac output partly compensate for diminished Pvo\n2 to defend arterial oxygenation.",

It seems justified therefore to consider H. parainfluenzae as generally nonpathogenic.",

Overall, 72% of patients had at least one positive bacterial culture or positive serology for C. pneumoniae or respiratory viruses. All cultures were obtained within 48 hours of admission, thereby reducing the likelihood of nosocomial infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis accounted for 56% of potential pathogens. Strikingly, gram-negative enteric bacteria and Pseudomonas or Stenotrophomonas represented 39% of potential pathogens. Positive serology for acute infection with C. pneumoniae or respiratory viruses (almost exclusively influenza) was found in 26% of the patients.115 This study suggests that a broader profile of potential pathogens may be present among patients with COPD with severe exacerbations. Although these findings should be confirmed in a larger study, the choice of empiric antibiotics for patients with AECOPD should be based in part on the degree of exacerbation severity, and broader-spectrum initial coverage may be warranted for patients with AECOPD who present with respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.",

Uncontrolled studies by McNamara and Eadie40, 75 also reported rhinoviral infections to be associated with COPD exacerbations in 43% and 20% of cases, respectively.

Marked rises in titers of antibodies against H. influenzae were associated with preceding viral or Mycoplasma infections, suggesting that viral infection promotes increased invasiveness of H. influenzae and subsequent infection.

In many COPD exacerbations, no obvious pathogen or precipitating cause is found. It is not known how frequently other potential factors, such as medication noncompliance or coincidental events such as pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction, play an inciting role in AECOPD. Indeed, it is often difficult to distinguish clinically between exacerbations with and without an infectious cause. This distinction is discussed subsequently in the section on antibiotic therapy.",

In the past, the risk of hypoventilation or even apnea resulting from O2 administration has been vastly overestimated, and the notion that O2 commonly induces clinically important hypercarbia and acidosis has been discredited.12, 13, 39, 104 The traditional concept is that correction of hypoxemia with supplemental O2 removes the hypoxic drive to breathe and leads to a fall in minute ventilation and subsequent carbon dioxide (CO2) retention.47 Aubier et al12 found that although administration of supplemental O2 does reduce minute ventilation and increase arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco\n2), mouth occlusion pressure (an indicator of central respiratory drive) was significantly higher during acute exacerbations than during stable conditions. The drive to breathe therefore remained very high in spite of oxygen treatment. In a later study by the same authors,13 patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure received 100% O2 for 15 minutes to abolish hypoxic drive. Minute ventilation fell by only 7% and could not account for the entire increase in Paco\n2. The authors concluded that the rise in CO2 was caused by increased Vd/Vt) (i.e., increased deadspace ventilation) and that the primary mechanism of O2-induced hypercarbia is / mismatching, perhaps through the loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction. More recent work by Dunn et al39 and Stradling119 has challenged Aubier's conclusions and defended the traditional concept that hypoventilation, rather than / mismatching, is to blame for O2-induced hypercarbia. One further mechanism that appears to contribute, albeit to a minor extent, is the Haldane effect, whereby CO2 is displaced from hemoglobin by O2, causing a rise in Paco\n2.119 Nevertheless, the risks for acute hypoxemia far outweigh the risks for severe hypercarbia. As such, supplemental O2 administration is recommended for hypoxemic patients with AECOPD.",

If nasal cannulae are used, flow rates of 1 to 2 L/minute generally suffice. The inspired concentration of oxygen (Fio\n2) usually increases by 3% to 4% for each increase of 1 L/minute in flow but varies according to the patient's own inspiratory flow rate. Venturi masks are more precise and should initially be set to deliver a Fio\n2 of 24% to 28%. On average, the Pao\n2 increases by 10 mm Hg when the Fio\n2 is increased from room air to 24%, and by 20 mm Hg when the Fio\n2 is increased to 28%.17 The target Pao\n2 is between 60 and 70 mm Hg, corresponding to the Pao\n2 at which there is near-complete saturation of hemoglobin with O2. Rarely, overzealous O2 administration produces progressive hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis.20, 34, 74 For this reason, response to O2 must be assessed according to arterial blood gas and pH measurements. These should be obtained at baseline and within 60 minutes of starting or changing the O2 concentration. If Pao\n2 remains intractably low or the pH drops as a result of increasing Paco\n2, alternate strategies to improve hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis must be devised. These include maximizing bronchodilation and the use of assisted ventilation.",

The authors attributed this time saving to approximately five puffs of IB. Interestingly, mean discharge FEV1 was not different between the two groups.110 Because these studies followed patients for only 60 to 90 minutes, Moayyedi et al79 recently attempted to capture longer-term benefits of combination therapy.

The authors argued that aminophylline should be considered in selected patients with acute exacerbations of COPD and asthma because reduced hospitalizations would decrease costs. Although their study illustrates a potentially important clinical benefit of theophylline, a cautious approach is necessary. The effect of theophylline on admission rates was not the primary outcome variable and the reduction in admission rates did not quite reach statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Even though the magnitude of the clinical benefit was large, theophylline produced no objective improvement in pulmonary function as measured by spirometry. Despite these reservations, similar reports of clinical benefit in the absence of statistically significant spirometric improvement have been found in studies of corticosteroids in acute asthma71 and bronchodilator therapy in acute COPD.110\n",

Antibiotics have been employed for prophylaxis and acute treatment of AECOPD. In the 1950s and 1960s, attention was given to preventing exacerbations with antibiotics. Murphy and Sethi83 reviewed nine prospective, placebocontrolled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis. Of these, five failed to show any reduction in the frequency of exacerbations, although two demonstrated significantly less time lost from work among patients receiving antibiotics. In contrast, compared with placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the frequency of exacerbations in four studies. In these investigations, prophylaxis seemed to benefit patients suffering the largest annual number of exacerbations. Some authorities therefore have recently suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate for individuals prone to frequent exacerbations,14 although this practice is not recommended as part of the regular care of all patients with COPD.",

They randomized 173 outpatients to receive either placebo or broad-spectrum antibiotic (amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline) during 362 COPD exacerbations. Exacerbations were classified according to severity. Type 1 (the most severe) was defined as an increase in dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence. Type 2 involved the presence of only two of the three symptoms, and type 3 was defined as the presence of one of the three symptoms in addition to one other finding (sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever, increased wheeze, or increased cough). Compared with placebo, antibiotics shortened the duration of exacerbations by about 2 days and accelerated recovery of peak expiratory flow rate (P < 0.02 for both). Treatment success, defined as resolution of symptoms within 21 days, occurred in 55% of the placebo group and 68.1% of patients receiving active treatment (P < 0.05). Significantly, among patients presenting with type 1 exacerbations, clinical deterioration was more than twice as common with placebo as with antibiotic. A clinician therefore would need to treat roughly eight exacerbations with antibiotics to achieve one treatment success beyond chance, or two in order to avoid a single deterioration. The authors concluded that avoidance of deleterious outcomes is the strongest reason to offer antibiotics to patients with AECOPD. Furthermore, they stated that antibiotics are clearly indicated in type 1 exacerbations, of no benefit in type 3 exacerbations, and probably justifiable for patients with type 2 presentations.11 Similar findings were reported in another large-scale, randomized trial comparing amoxicillin/clavulanate to placebo.5\n",

Several schemes have been proposed to stratify the patient's risk and select the most appropriate therapy.14, 53, 72, 134 The simplest, and most recent, classification system is presented in Table 3\n. Grossman53 has classified acute exacerbations into four groups. Group 1 patients have acute simple bronchitis, likely of viral origin, for which antibiotics are not recommended at the outset. If symptoms persist for longer than 1 week, a macrolide or tetracycline is suggested to treat suspected pathogenic organisms (i.e. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Group 2 patients have simple chronic bronchitis with minimally impaired lung function and no additional risk factors for treatment failure. In these patients, amoxicillin, tetracycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are the proposed first-line agents because the consequences of treatment failure in this group are generally few.11 Probable pathogens are H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae. Group 3 patients have moderate to severe COPD and other risk factors for treatment failure, such as frequent exacerbations and comorbid conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, or chronic liver disease. The probable bacterial pathogens are similar to those in group 2, although gram-negative organisms are more likely in patients with severely impaired lung function. Because the costs of treatment failure are high in this group, and because \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are increasingly prevalent, fluoroquinolones are the suggested first-line treatment. Group 4 patients have chronic suppurative lung disease, particularly bronchiectasis. Antibiotic therapy is directed at P. aeruginosa and other commonly drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (see Table 3). As noted, approaches to antibiotic therapy based upon a rational appraisal of patient risk factors and likely pathogens reduce the risk for treatment failure and avoid unnecessary medical and economic expense.",

Clinical endpoints (days of illness, hospitalizations, time to next exacerbation) were blended with quality-of-life measurements (Nottingham Health Profile, St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire, Health Utility Index), and total respiratory costs from a societal perspective. Although the overall results indicated no advantage for either treatment arm, in patients with risk factors (severe underlying lung disease, more than four exacerbations per year, duration of bronchitis greater than 10 years, elderly, significant comorbid illness) the use of ciprofloxacin led to improved clinical outcome, higher quality of life, and fewer costs. The results of this study would suggest that aggressive antimicrobial therapy directed especially toward resistant organisms in high-risk patients is a more effective strategy than no therapy or therapy with older antimicrobials that would not be effective against the usual target organisms, particularly \u03b2-lactamase-producing H. influenzae.",

Mean FEV1 and FVC values were no different between the treatment groups at the end of the study. More recently, Niewoehner et al88 published the important Systemic Corticosteroids in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations trial. They performed a three-way randomization whereby 80 patients received an 8-week course of glucocorticoids, 80 received a 2-week course, and 111 received placebo. Steroids resulted in faster recovery of FEV1 and shortened hospital stay by 1 day (P < 0.05). At both 30 and 90 days, steroid therapy reduced treatment failures (defined as death from any cause, need for intubation, readmission, or intensification of drug therapy) by approximately 10%. There was no difference between 2 and 8 weeks of treatment with respect to spirometry or treatment failure rates, however. The dose of methylprednisolone was high (125 mg every 6 hours for 3 days) and resulted in significantly more hyperglycemia and, possibly, increased secondary infection rates.106\n",

When the increased metabolic requirements of the respiratory muscles cannot be matched by a commensurate rise in the cardiac output, further acidosis and muscle fatigue ensue.

Because data are generated by observing large numbers of patients, typically in tertiary referral centers, the pertinence of these data to individual patients may be limited, especially outside of major centers where most COPD exacerbations are treated.33 Studies of prognosis in patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure performed during previous decades are less relevant by today's standards. Current outcomes appear to be better than those of the past, in part because of the widespread use of controlled O2 therapy, corticosteroids and IB, availability of better \u03b22-agonists, reduced use of methylxanthines, and increased use of noninvasive ventilatory support.33 Indeed, there is evidence to support a trend toward improved survival for hypercapnic respiratory failure over the past 20 years. The mortality rates in studies of survival of acute respiratory failure in COPD conducted from 1968 to 1973 ranged from 22% to 34%, with an overall mortality of 26%.

Baseline FEV1 was not available for most patients. Half the patients required intensive care unit admission and 35% required mechanical ventilation. Hospital mortality was 11%. More striking, however, was the finding that following discharge, one third of the patients died in within 6 months and one half within 2 years. Not surprisingly, patients who survived hospitalization had a substantial risk of discharge to a facility other than their home (20%) and of readmission to acute care over the ensuing 6 months (50%). Higher acute physiology score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; APACHE III), older age, and poor functional status prior to admission independently increased risk of death. Improved survival was predicted by greater BMI and albumin level, higher Pao\n2/Fio\n2, and, surprisingly, the presence of cor pulmonale and congestive heart failure as the cause of the exacerbation. The latter findings may be explained by the good response of these two disorders to acute therapy.",

In their analysis of 39 consecutive acute COPD exacerbations, neither age nor spirometric, blood gas, or nutritional indices predicted survival. In contrast, Menzies et al78 reported that, among their 95 patients, higher baseline FEV1 and serum albumin were significantly associated with improved 1-year survival following mechanical ventilation.

They observed episodes of acute respiratory failure in 19 and 33 patients with baseline FEV1 of greater and less than 1 L respectively. Only 56% of the cohort with severe COPD survived weaning and spontaneous breathing for 72 hours. Furthermore, in the same group, 1-year survival was only 27%. Absence of infiltrates on chest radiograph was the most influential predictor of survival in patients with severe COPD. Pneumonia accounted for most of the infiltrates that were seen in this group. Baseline FEV1 obtained during a period of clinical stability prior to the episode of acute respiratory failure was available for all patients. The extent of baseline obstruction alone was not statistically correlated with short-term survival in either group, but the combination of severe baseline obstruction and pulmonary infiltrates markedly increased the risk for death. Outcomes following AECOPD associated with ICU admission and respiratory failure are discussed further in the article by Sethi and Siegel in this issue.",

They analyzed 362 admissions for acute COPD exacerbation from the APACHE III database. Hospital mortality was 24%. For patients aged 65 and older, hospital and 1-year mortality rates were 30% and 59% respectively. Their report emphasizes that individual clinical variables have different value for predicting short- and long-term survival. Patient age, for example, was a statistically significant determinant of 6-month survival but not influential for hospital mortality after accounting for nonrespiratory organ dysfunction. Similarly, the presence of hypercarbia was of no value in predicting hospital mortality but became important over the long term; 1-year mortality rates for patients with admission Paco\n2 of less than 50 mm Hg versus greater than 50 mm Hg were 54% and 70% respectively. The most significant predictors of short and long-term mortality are development and severity of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Respiratory dysfunction is more important over the longer term. As the authors state: \u201cIn most cases, the acute, life-threatening components of the exacerbations can be reversed and short-term death avoided by mechanical ventilation and other appropriate treatments. However, because abnormalities in respiratory physiology reflect underlying severity of lung disease, patients with greater abnormality who survive hospitalization are at greater risk of subsequent death.\u201d107\n",

The medical and economic costs arising from acute exacerbations of COPD are therefore expected to increase over the coming years. Although exacerbations may be initiated by multiple factors, the most common identifiable associations are with bacterial and viral infections. These are associated with approximately 50% to 70% and 20% to 30% of COPD exacerbations, respectively. In addition to smoking cessation, annual influenza vaccination is the most important method for preventing exacerbations. Controlled O2 is the most important intervention for patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failue. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials justifies the use of corticosteroids, bronchodilators (but not theophylline), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (in selected patients), and antibiotics, particularly for severe exacerbations. Antibiotics should be chosen according to the patient's risk for treatment failure and the potential for antibiotic resistance. In the acute setting, combined treatment with \u03b2-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators is reasonable but not supported by randomized controlled studies. Physicians should identify and, when possible, correct malnutrition. Chest physiotherapy has no proven role in the management of acute exacerbations.",
