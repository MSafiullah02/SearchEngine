COVID-19 was diagnosed in accordance with the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program, 6th edition, published by the National Health Commission of China11. Importantly, to eliminate the potential missed cases of COVID-19, clinical diagnosis was added in the 5th edition of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program, which stipulated that a suspected case with an evident radiological manifestation should be identified as a confirmed case of COVID-1912. Six of the 10 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of throat swab samples. Of the remaining 4 patients, 3 had a negative result and 1 did not receive the qRT-PCR test during her hospitalization. All patients presented with clear evidence of viral pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) scans. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study.",

Throat swab samples were obtained from patients who were identified as having a suspected COVID-19 infection and were analyzed by qRT-PCR with use of a kit recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.

Three patients had osteoporosis along with an underlying disease such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three patients (Cases 1, 4, and 7) did not exhibit severe symptoms or have obvious evidence of the disease on CT scans on admission and therefore underwent a surgical procedure; fever and fatigue signs were observed after the operation.",

Six (60%) of 10 patients had a low level of albumin because of their poor condition. Most patients had normal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (8 patients; 80%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (8 patients; 80%), total bilirubin (9 patients; 90%), and blood urea nitrogen (6 patients; 60%). The level of creatinine was higher than normal in 3 patients and lower than normal in 3 patients. Seven (88%) of 8 patients had an elevated procalcitonin concentration, and 9 (100%) of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. While only 6 patients (60%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, CT imaging demonstrated unilateral or bilateral patchy consolidation or ground-glass opacities in all patients (Fig. 2). Therefore, according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition), all patients were considered or highly suspected to have COVID-19. The timing of typical signs of viral infection on CT scans (discrete ground-glass opacities in specific areas of the lung) and the timing of relevant positive SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR tests are listed in Appendix Table I. The detailed changes in routine blood test results, coagulation function, blood biochemistry, and infection-related biomarkers were collected starting from the date of admission (Figs. 3 and 4).",

At the same time, most patients with hip fracture are older, many are in relatively poor physical condition, and many have underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease15,16. Such patients generally are advised to undergo surgical treatment as soon as possible. This approach not only promotes fracture-healing and facilitates recovery of mobility but also reduces various complications, such as the onset of pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis17. If surgical treatment is not possible, these patients must remain in bed for 8 to 12 weeks, and, because of pain and the use of traction, most have to lie flat without being able to roll over, let alone stand. The stress associated with the fracture and surgical treatment can trigger a series of oxidative stress responses and excessive inflammation18. These reactions upregulate the expression of a series of inflammatory factors and decrease the immunity of the patients, increasing the likelihood of pneumonia19. Postoperative pulmonary complications have been reported to occur in 4.9% of patients after the surgical treatment of a hip fracture20. Wong et al. reported the case of an 81-year-old woman with an intertrochanteric fracture and SARS who died 7 days after surgery21. In the present study, 1 patient (Case 7) died 11 days after surgery and 3 patients (Cases 3, 6, and 9) died 8 days after admission without surgery being performed. Considering the high mortality of patients with COVID-19, surgical treatment for patients with both a fracture and COVID-19 should be carefully planned in advance. Furthermore, particular attention should be given to such patients after the surgical treatment of the fracture because of possibility of rapid deterioration of their condition.",
