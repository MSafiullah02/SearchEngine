Soon after its emergence, CPV-2 underwent genetic evolution giving rise consecutively to two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b that replaced progressively the original type. In 2000, a new antigenic variant, CPV-2c, was detected in Italy and rapidly spread to several countries. In comparison to the original type CPV-2, the antigenic variants display increased pathogenicity in dogs and extended host range, being able to infect and cause disease in cats. Epidemiological survey indicate that the newest type CPV-2c is becoming prevalent in different geographic regions and is often associated to severe disease in adult dogs and also in dogs that have completed the vaccination protocols. However, the primary cause of failure of CPV vaccination is interference by maternally derived immunity. Diagnosis of CPV infection by traditional methods has been shown to be poorly sensitive, especially in the late stages of infections. New diagnostic approaches based on molecular methods have been developed for sensitive detection of CPV in clinical samples and rapid characterisation of the viral type. Continuous surveillance will help assess whether there is a real need to update currently available vaccines and diagnostic tests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "\u00df 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, five genera are included in the subfamily Parvovirinae, namely Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus. Canine parvovirus (CPV) belongs to genus Parvovirus and has been included in the unique species Feline panleukopenia virus together with feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), mink enteritis virus (MEV) and raccoon parvovirus (RPV) (Tattersall et al., 2005) . CPV is genetically and antigenically unrelated to canine minute virus (CnMV), formerly known as canine parvovirus type 1 (CPV-1), which is responsible for neonatal death in dogs and is now included in the genus Bocavirus together with bovine parvovirus and human bocavirus (Tattersall et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 522, "text": "(Tattersall et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 798, "end": 823, "text": "(Tattersall et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Taxonomy and virus structure"}, {"text": "Parvoviruses are small (diameter of 25 nm), nonenveloped viruses infecting vertebrates and insects. The parvovirus virion consists of a spherical capsid, which is composed by three proteins and contains a linear, singlestrand DNA molecule (Muzyczka and Berns, 2001) . By means of X-ray crystallography, the parvovirus capsid has been found to be formed by 60 copies of a combination of VP1, VP2 and VP3. VP1 contains the full-length VP2 sequence plus an additional N-terminal domain. VP2, the most abundant structural protein, accounts for 90% of the viral capsid, representing the major determinant of host range and virus-host interactions, and is cleaved to VP3 by host proteases. The 60 capsid protein subunits are made up of a core eight-stranded, antiparallel b-barrel domain with loop insertions between the strands forming large spike-like protrusions at or surrounding the icosahedral threefold axes. Other characteristic features of the parvoviral capsid include a 15-\u00c5 canyon-like depression about the fivefold axes and a dimple-like depression at the icosahedral twofold axes. The parvoviral genome consists of a $5000-nucleotide DNA molecule containing two large open reading frames (ORFs) and smaller or overlapping genes, encoding for two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and two structural (VP1 and VP2) proteins through alternative splicing of the same mRNAs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 265, "text": "(Muzyczka and Berns, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Taxonomy and virus structure"}, {"text": "Virus replication takes place in the cell nuclei and requires rapidly dividing cells of fetuses and newborns or of hematopoietic and intestinal tissues of young and adult animals. Their replication in vivo is rarely associated with the appearance of nuclear inclusion bodies, whereas the cytopathic effect induced in vitro is not always evident. All parvoviruses are highly stable in the environment, as they are extremely resistant to pH and temperature changes and to treatment with lipid solvents, trypsin and most disinfectants. Virions can be inactivated by formalin, sodium hypochlorite, beta propiolactone, hydroxylamine, oxidizing agents and ultraviolet irradiation. Several parvoviruses are able to agglutinate erythrocytes of different mammal and bird species, and some diagnostic tests for parvovirus infections rely on this hemagglutination activity (Muzyczka and Berns, 2001 (Truyen, 2006) . The original viral strain, designated as CPV-2 to distinguish the novel virus from the previouslyknown CPV-1, caused severe, fatal epizootics of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and subacute myocarditis in kennels and shelters worldwide (Truyen, 2006) . There are at least six or seven amino acid (aa) changes between FPV and CPV-2 (Table 1) , mostly accumulated in the VP2 domain interacting with the host-cell transferrin receptor (TfR). These changes may have contributed to the gain of affinity for canine TfR observed during the shift from FPV or FPV-like parvovirus to CPV-2 (Shackelton et al., 2005) . Another important difference between these two carnivore parvoviruses is that CPV evolves much more rapidly than FPV (Battilani et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2008c Decaro et al., , 2009b , showing genomic substitution rates similar to those of RNA viruses, with values of about 10 \u00c04 substitutions per site per year (Shackelton et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 862, "end": 887, "text": "(Muzyczka and Berns, 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 888, "end": 902, "text": "(Truyen, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1151, "text": "(Truyen, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1506, "text": "(Shackelton et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1650, "text": "(Battilani et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1671, "text": "Decaro et al., 2008c", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1694, "text": "Decaro et al., , 2009b", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1849, "text": "(Shackelton et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1232, "end": 1241, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Taxonomy and virus structure"}, {"text": "Active virus circulation and initial vaccination programmes helped develop herd immunity in canine populations, which greatly reduced mortality and further spreading of the virus. However, host-immunity pressure may have also contributed to the progressive emergence of CPV-2 antigenic variants. In the 1980s, two antigenic variants, distinguishable using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), emerged within few years and were termed CPV types 2a (CPV-2a) and 2b (CPV-2b). Currently, the antigenic variants have completely replaced the original type 2, which is still used in most commercial vaccines, and are variously distributed in the canine population worldwide. CPV-2a and CPV-2b differ from the original strain CPV-2 in five or six aa residues of the VP2 capsid protein (Table 1 ). In contrast, only two residues differentiated CPV-2a from CPV-2b, i.e., N426D and I555V (Truyen, 2006) . Residue 426 is situated in epitope A, over the threefold spike of the capsid, and a role of antigenic escape has been assigned to the same residue of the VP2 of the parvovirus minute virus of mice. At residue 555, old type 2a CPVs displayed an isoleucine residue differentiating this variant from CPV2/2b strains both exhibiting V555. With the subsequent introduction of the change I555V, the recent CPV-2a strains differ from CPV-2b/2c only at position 426 of the VP2 protein (Table 1) (Martella et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2009b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 870, "end": 884, "text": "(Truyen, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1397, "text": "(Martella et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1419, "text": "Decaro et al., 2009b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 770, "end": 778, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1373, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Taxonomy and virus structure"}, {"text": "Other mutations occurring during the last decades and being fixed in type 2a/2b CPVs include S297A and T440A.

Different strategies have been proposed to overcome the MDA interference, including high-titer vaccines (Burtonboy et al., 1991) and intranasal vaccination .

Those mutant strains displayed the novel substitution irrespective of the antigenic type (2a or 2b), so that had been referred to as CPV-2a(c) or CPV-2b(c) on the basis of the aa encountered at residue 426 (Asn or Asp) of the VP2 protein (Ikeda et al., 2000) .

All pups displayed clinical signs of parvovirosis (mucoid or watery diarrhea and transient leukopenia), but none showed either hemorrhagic diarrhea or vomiting and all recovered in a few days. By real-time PCR, prolonged shedding (up to 51 days) of CPV-2c was observed. However, the benign course of the CPV-2c infection is in contrast with recent findings that are indicative of a more severe disease induced by this mutant. Spibey et al. (2008) have carried out an experimental infection of beagle dogs with a field isolate of CPV-2c. This experimental challenge was carried out principally to confirm the ability of an existing type 2-based vaccine to prevent clinical signs and shedding. However, in this context it is of interest that all six of the infected control dogs became severely ill and displayed leukopenia from day 4 post-infection; three of them had to be euthanized and the remaining three recovered but required a supportive therapy. To date, whether there is a greater infection or virulence by one variant over the others is not well established either in experimental systems or on the basis of field observations. Indeed, it is reasonable to think that all three variants have a similar pathogenetic potential, which can increase depending on particular field conditions (age, immunological status, stressing factors, etc.). Commonly, CPV infects 4-12-week-old pups that are prone to acquire the virus in concomitance with the wane of MDA (Greene and Decaro, in press) . Adults are thought to be resistant to CPV infection due to the age-reduced susceptibility and presence of specific immunity induced by vaccination or previous (often subclinical) infections. Although CPV infection is generally restricted to young animals, it has recently become an issue also in adult dogs. Apart from personal observations (Kapil et al., 2007) , there are some scientific reports of the occurrence of parvovirosis in adult dogs, mostly associated to CPV-2c infection Decaro et al., 2008a Decaro et al., , 2009a . In one episode, a two-year-old mixed breed dog was severely affected as a consequence of infection with a strain which was mischaracterised as CPV-2b by means of MAbs . However, molecular characterisation by PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis of the VP2 protein gene was able to correctly type the virus as 'true' CPV-2c (Martella, unpublished data) .

A case of disease induced by this variant was described even in a 12-year-old dog displaying fever (40.5 8C), accelerated pulse and respiratory rates, abdominal pain, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea and dramatic lymphopenia.

The established TaqMan assay was successfully employed in pathogenesis studies carried out during natural (Decaro et al., 2005b) and experimental (Decaro et al., 2005a) infections and was also used to evaluate virus distribution in different tissues (Decaro et al., 2007c) .
