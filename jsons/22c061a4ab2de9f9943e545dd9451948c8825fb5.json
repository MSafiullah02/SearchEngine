            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a globally emerging and re-emerging enteric coronavirus in pigs causing serious economic threats to the world swine industry. Since the re-emergence of massive PEDV outbreaks in South Korea in 2013\u00c02014, domestic pig farms have continued to experience PED epidemics or endemics. This study represents the molecular characterization of PEDV isolates identified in diarrhoeic animals collected across the country in 2017. Initial sequencing analysis of the full-length S genes revealed that 70% of the 2017 isolates (7/10) belong to the G2b subgroup, while the remaining isolates were classified as G1b. The data indicated that both variant G1b and global epidemic G2b strains were responsible for current PED outbreaks in South Korea. The 2017 G1b and G2b isolates shared 98.7%-99.4% and 98.1%-99.2% amino acid sequence identity at the S gene level and 99.3% and 99.0%-99.6% nucleotide sequence homology at the genome level compared to the corresponding Korean prototype G1b and G2b strains, respectively. In an interesting manner, one G2b-like KNU-1705 strain was found to possess a large 39-nucleotide deletion in the ORF1a region theoretically encoding nonstructural protein 3. Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire genome and spike protein sequences indicated that the 2017 isolates were most closely related to other global G1b or G2b strains but formed different branches within the same genogroup. These results indicate that PEDVs undergo continuous evolution in the field. In addition, one 2017 PEDV strain, KOR/KNU-1705/2017, was successfully isolated and propagated in Vero cells. The antisera raised against the Korean prototype 2014 G2b strain efficiently neutralized KNU-1705 virus infection, suggesting antigenic homology between the 2014 and 2017 PEDV strains. Our data advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and antigenicity of PEDV circulating in South Korea.

The first two large ORFs, ORF1a and 1b, encompass the 5 0 -proximal two-thirds of the genome and code for nonstructural proteins (nsps). ORF1a translation yields a replicase polyprotein (pp) 1a, whereas ORF1b is expressed by a \u00c01 ribosomal frame shift that C-terminally extends pp1a into pp1ab. These pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically matured by internal viral proteases to generate 16 processing end-products, named as nsp1-16. The remaining ORFs in the 3 0 -proximal region of the genome encode four canonical structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as one accessory gene, ORF3 (Duarte et al., 1994; Kocherhans et al., 2001; Lai, Perlman, & Anderson, 2007; Lee, 2015; Saif et al., 2012) .",

A marked decrease in acute PED epizootics occurred in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, and only sporadic outbreaks have occurred in recent years (Opriessnig, 2016) . In Asia, PED was first reported in 1982, and unlike in Europe, it has since posed a huge economic threat to the Asian pork industry (Chen et al., 2008; Kweon et al., 1993; Li et al., 2012; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983) . In May 2013, PED outbreaks suddenly appeared in the United States and swiftly spread across the nation, as well as to adjacent countries. This outbreak caused the death of more than 8 million newborn piglets in the United States alone during a 1-year-epidemic period, leading to annual losses in the range of $900 million to $1.8 billion (Langel, Paim, Lager, Vlasova, & Saif, 2016; Mole, 2013; Ojkic et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014) . The US emergent strain-like viruses further reached East Asian countries, resulting in nationwide PED disasters (Lee, 2015; Lin et al., 2014; MAFF, 2018) . During the 2013-2014 pandemics, PED rapidly swept across mainland South Korea and Jeju Island, killing hundreds of thousands of piglets in domestic herds , 2017 . Since then, PED epizootics or enzootics have regionally occurred through provinces in South Korea with intensive swine industries. To investigate the diversity of PEDVs responsible for the ongoing outbreaks in South Korea, in this study, we determined the full-length sequences of the S proteins of field isolates and complete genome sequences of representative strains identified throughout 2017. In addition, we isolated and serially propagated a KOR/KNU-1705/2017 strain and assessed the antigenic cross-reactivity between 2014 and 2017 PEDV field isolates.",

            "text": "deletion (DEL) at positions 160 and 161 within the N-terminal hypervariable region of S compared to the prototype CV777 strain(Lee, 2015;Lee et al., 2010) (Figure S2). In a remarkable way, one isolate KNU-1710 was found to contain an additional 2-aa S DEL at positions 137 and 138 in the S1 domain, which was completely absent in the other G1 and G2 isolates in GenBank (Figure S2). Thus, the S gene of KNU-1710 is 4,155 nucleotides (nt) in length encoding a 1384-aa protein, which is 6-nt (2-aa) shorter than the homologous genes in most G2 strains. G1b strains are thought to arise from a recombination event between classical G1a and field epidemic G2 viruses, and their S genes consist of 4,152 nt encoding 1,383 aa residues identical to those of classicalG1a strains. They showed typical genetic and phylogenetic features (no S INDELs compared to CV777 and different phylogenetic subgroup [G1b or G2] depending on the sequence of the S protein or whole-genome) (Lee, 2015; Lee, Park, Shin, & Lee, 2014). All G1b isolates identified in this study equally contained the aforementioned S gene characteristics of G1b (Figure S2). The full-length genomes of one representative G1b and all G2b epidemic strains collected in 2017 were sequenced and analysed to determine their genetic relationships with other global PEDV strains. In particular, a G2b-like KNU-1705 strain contains a unique 39-nt DEL at positions 3,322 and 3,360 located in the ORF1a region potentially encoding nsp3, which acts as a papain-like protease (PL pro ). This large ORF1a-DEL pattern has been unprecedented in other G1b and G2b field strains reported in previous and current studies (Figure S3). No additional insertions or deletions were identified in the genomes of all 2017 G1b and G2b isolates. Except for the KNU-1710 and KNU-1705 strains with a notable DEL in S or ORF1a, respectively, the entire genomic sequences of the remaining five 2017 G2b strains were 28,038 nt in length, excluding the 3 0 poly(A) tail, while the 2017 G1b KNU-1702 genome is 28,029 nt long as reported previously (Lee & Lee, 2014; Lee, Park et al., 2014). The genome of G1b KNU-1702 shared high nucleotide homology (99.3%) with other complete G1b PEDV genomes in GenBank, showing the lowest nt difference (177-nt) with the Korean G1b strain KNU-1406. Compared to the complete genome of the Korean prototype G2b strain KNU-1305, the genomes of the 2017 G2b strains had 103-255-nt differences (99.0%-99.6% homology)",

One PEDV isolate designated as KNU-1705 was successfully isolated from the faeces of a naturally infected piglet from a commercial farm located in Chungnam Province obtained on December 19, 2017. KNU-1705 produced apparent CPEs typical of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytium and detachment, in infected Vero cells from passage 3 (P3) (Figure 2a). Virus propagation was confirmed by detecting PEDV antigens by IFA using a PEDV N protein-specific MAb (CAVAC, Daejeon, South Korea). As shown in Figure 2a, distinct staining was distributed in the cytoplasm of typical syncytial cells. In addition, S glycoprotein gene sequencing revealed that the P10 isolate (KNU-180117-P10) contains one nucleotide change, resulting in a nonsynonymous mutation (Ser to Leu) at amino acid position 1,708, compared to the original faecal sample KNU-1705-faeces. Growth kinetics analysis further indicated that KNU-1705 replicated efficiently in Vero cells, reaching a maximum titre of >10 5 TCID 50 /ml by 24 hr postinfection (hpi)(Figure 2b). Next, we tested sow antisera previously elicited by a PEDV G2b KNU-141112 strain(Baek et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2015) to determine their cross-neutralization ability against the contemporary KNU-1705 isolate (Figure 2c). In agreement with previous studies, the antisera were greatly effective in inhibiting KNU-141112 infection with mean neutralizing antibody (NA) titres of 1:131. Similar to that, highly diluted antisera efficiently protect Vero cells infected with the recent KNU-1705 isolate with mean NA titres of 1:80, T A B L E 1 Pairwise comparisons of the nucleotide and protein sequences of the S protein genes of the 2017 isolates and genogroup representative porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus strains Strain name (Genogroup)",

(a) Cytopathology and IFA of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus isolate KNU-1705 in infected Vero cells. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with PEDV KNU-1705-P10. PEDV-specific CPEs were observed daily and photographed at 24 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 2009 (first panel). For immunostaining, infected cells were fixed at 24 hpi and incubated with MAb against the N protein, followed by incubation with Alexa green-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (second panel). The cells were then counterstained with DAPI (third panels) and examined using a fluorescence microscope at 2009 magnification. (b) One-step growth kinetics for KNU-1705 strains. Vero cells were independently infected with PEDV KNU-1705-P5 and -P10. At the indicated time points postinfection, culture supernatants were harvested, and virus titres were determined. Results are expressed as the mean values from triplicate wells, and error bars represent standard derivations. (c) Cross-neutralization between 2014 and 2017 PEDV isolates. Serum samples were subjected to the virus neutralization assays using KNU-141112 (circles) and KNU-1705 (diamonds) strains.

This finding indicates the effectiveness of 2013-2014 pandemic strain (KNU-141112)-derived vaccines currently available in South Korea against existing PEDV epidemics.
