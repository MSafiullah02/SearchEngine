Body mass index was normal (20.8 kg/m2). She was treated with natalizumab from 2007, switched by fingolimod in February 2019 after JC virus seroconversion. Despite fingolimod, the patient reported a progressive clinical worsening of the lower limb paresis, and cerebral MRI revealed several gadolinium enhanced-T1 lesions. This led to a switch for ocrelizumab. Before fingolimod discontinuation, the absolute lymphocyte count was 0.29 G/L (N: 1.0\u20134.0), raising up to 1.02 G/L at ocrelizumab initiation. EDSS was 6 on the day of the first ocrelizumab infusion. Two weeks after the first cycle of infusions (300 mg on March 5 and March 19 2020), in the middle of COVID-19 outbreak in France, the patient was referred to the hospital after a traumatic fall without loss of consciousness. Due to a mild inflammatory syndrome with elevation of C-reactive protein (19 mg/L, N < 5), a PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed and revealed the presence of the virus on March 27 2020. Thoracic CT showed nodular and striped ground glass opacities. Grade 2 lymphopenia was noticed (absolute lymphocyte count: 0.52 G/L, N: 1.0\u20134.0). No respiratory symptoms, nor fever, nor anosmia nor flu-like syndrome were reported by the patient, and clinical examination did not detect respiratory dysfunction. At 14 days post-COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient remained asymptomatic.",

Her past medical history included severe comorbidities, such as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) related to smoking (more than 30 packs/years), and epilepsy since June 2017. Body mass index was normal (22.4 kg/m2). She received natalizumab since 2007, last JC virus serology was controlled negative in October 2019. EDSS was 8, with tetraparesis and cognitive disorders. Last infusion of natalizumab (number 119) was performed on 14th February 2020. Her symptomatic treatment included venlafaxine, gabapentin, melatonin and bromazepam, anti-epileptic treatment included valproate. Biology revealed a mild increase of lymphocytes at 5.400 G/L (considered as related to natalizumab). One month after natalizumab infusion, mild fever (38.5 \u030aC) and cough were reported, with non-bacterial pneumonia requiring oxygen support (2L/min). COVID-19 infection was confirmed on March 16 2020 (day 2) with PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Decrease of lymphocytes count to 2.11 G/L and of platelet count to 94 G/L (N: 150\u2013400) were reported with moderate elevation of CRP (60 mg/L). Clinical recovery was complete with oxygen stop 20 days after the first COVID-19 symptoms.",

Meanwhile, it seems reasonable to discuss treatment options individually, considering MS activity and known risk factors for severe COVID-19. National recommendations have been issued [8] and will be updated upon the results from epidemiological and immunological studies about COVID-19 in MS population.",
