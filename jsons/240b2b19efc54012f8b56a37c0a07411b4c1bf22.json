            "text": "Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) by anammox bacteria contributes 21 significantly to the global nitrogen cycle, and plays a major role in sustainable wastewater 22 treatment. Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4 + ) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite (NO2 -23 ) or nitric oxide (NO) as the electron acceptor. In the absence of NO2or NO, anammox bacteria 24 can couple formate oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV). Their 25 genomes contain homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella cytochromes involved in extracellular 26 electron transfer (EET). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have EET 27 capability and can couple the oxidation of NH4 + with transfer of electrons to carbon-based 28 insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show using complementary approaches that in 29 the absence of NO2 -, freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4 + with 30 transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene 31 oxide (GO) or electrodes poised at a certain potential in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). 32 Metagenomics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and electrochemical analyses coupled with 33 MEC performance confirmed that anammox electrode biofilms were responsible for current 34 generation through EET-dependent oxidation of NH4 + . 15 N-labelling experiments revealed the 35 molecular mechanism of the EET-dependent anammox process. NH4 + was oxidized to N2 via 36 hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate when electrode was the terminal electron acceptor. 37 Comparative transcriptomics analysis supported isotope labelling experiments and revealed an 38 alternative pathway for NH4 + oxidation coupled to EET when electrode is used as electron acceptor 39 compared to NO2as electron acceptor. To our knowledge, our results provide the first 40 experimental evidence that marine and freshwater anammox bacteria can couple NH4 + oxidation 41 with EET, which is a significant finding, and challenges our perception of a key player of anaerobic 42 oxidation of NH4 + in natural environments and engineered systems.",

            "text": "Main text: Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) by anammox bacteria contributes up to 44 50% of N2 emitted into Earth's atmosphere from the oceans (1, 2). Also, anammox bacteria has 45 been extensively investigated for energy-efficient removal of NH4 + from wastewater (3). Initially, 46 anammox bacteria were assumed to be restricted to NH4 + as electron donor and NO2or NO as 47 electron acceptor (4, 5). More than a decade ago, preliminary experiments showed that Kuenenia 48 stuttgartiensis and Scalindua could couple the oxidation of formate to the reduction of insoluble 49 extracellular electron acceptors such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV) oxides (6, 7). However, the mechanism 50 of how anammox bacteria reduce insoluble extracellular electron acceptors has remained 51 unexplored to date. Also, growth or electrochemical activity was not quantified in these 52 experiments. Further, these experiments could not discriminate between Fe(III) oxide reduction 53 for nutritional acquisition (i.e., via siderophores) versus respiration through extracellular electron 54 transfer (EET) (8). Therefore, with these preliminary experiments it could not be determined if 55 anammox bacteria have EET capability or not. 56 Although preliminary work showed that K. stuttgartiensis could not reduce Mn(IV) or Fe(III) 57 with NH4 + as electron donor (6), the possibility of anammox bacteria to oxidize NH4 + coupled to 58 EET to other insoluble extracellular electron acceptors cannot be ruled out. In fact EET (and set 59 of genes involved with EET) is not uniformly applied to all insoluble extracellular electron 60 acceptors; some electroactive bacteria are not able to transfer electrons to carbon-based insoluble 61 extracellular electron acceptors such as electrodes in bioelectrochemical systems but could reduce 62 metal oxides and vice versa (9). It is known for more than two decades that carbon-based high-63 molecular-weight organic materials, which are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments 64 and that are not involved in microbial metabolism (i.e., humic substances) can be used as external 65 electron acceptor for the anaerobic oxidation of compounds (10). Also, it has been reported that 66 anaerobic NH4 + oxidation linked to microbial reduction of natural organic matter fuels nitrogen 67 loss in marine sediments (11). A literature survey of more than 100 EET-capable species indicated 68 that there are many ecological niches for microorganisms able to perform EET (12). This resonates 69 with a recent finding where Listeria monocytogenes, a host-associated pathogen and fermentative 70 Gram-positive bacterium, was able to respire through a flavin-based EET process and behaved as 71 an electrochemically active microorganism (i.e., able to transfer electrons from oxidized fuel 72 (substrate) to a working electrode via EET process) (13). Further it was reported that anammox 73 bacteria seem to have homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella multi-heme cytochromes that are 74 responsible for EET (14). These observations stimulated us to investigate whether anammox 75 bacteria can couple NH4 + oxidation with EET to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron 76 acceptor and can behave as electrochemically active bacteria. 77 78 Ammonium oxidation coupled with EET 79 To evaluate if anammox bacteria possess EET capability, we first tested whether enriched 80 cultures of three phylogenetically and physiologically distant anammox species can couple the 81 oxidation of NH4 + with the reduction of insoluble extracellular electron acceptor. Cultures of Ca. 82 Brocadia (freshwater anammox species) and Ca. Scalindua (marine anammox species) were 83 enriched and grown as planktonic cells in membrane bioreactors (Fig. S1A) (15). Fluorescence in 84 situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the anammox bacteria constituted >95% of the bioreactor's 85 community (Fig. S1B-G). Also, a previously enriched K. stuttgartiensis (freshwater anammox 86 species) culture was used (4). The anammox cells were incubated anoxically for 216 hours in the 87 presence of 15 NH4 + (4 mM) and graphene oxide (GO) as a proxy for insoluble electron acceptor. 88 No NO2or NO3were added to the incubations. GO particles are bigger than bacterial cells and 89 cannot be internalized, and thus GO can only be reduced by EET (16). Indeed, GO was reduced 90 by anammox bacteria as shown by the formation of suspended reduced GO (rGO), which is black 91 in color and insoluble (Fig. 1A) (16). In contrast, abiotic controls did not form insoluble black 92 precipitates. Reduction of GO to rGO by anammox bacteria was further confirmed by Raman 93 spectroscopy, where the formation of the characteristic 2D and D+D\u00a2 peaks of rGO (17) were 94 detected in the vials with anammox cells (Fig. 1B), whereas no peaks were detected in the abiotic 95",

            "text": "control. Further, isotope analysis of the produced N2 gas showed that anammox cells were capable 96 of 30 N2 formation (Fig. 1C ). In contrast, 29 N2 production was not significant in any of the tested 97 anammox species or controls, suggesting that unlabeled NO2or NO3were not involved. The 98 production of 30 N2 indicated that the anammox cultures use a different mechanism for NH4 + 99 oxidation in the presence of an insoluble extracellular electron acceptor (further explained below). 100 Gas production was not observed in the abiotic control (Fig. 1C). To determine if anammox 101 bacteria are still dominant after incubation with GO, we extracted and sequenced total DNA from 102 the Brocadia and Scalindua vials at the end of the experiment. Differential coverage showed that 103 the metagenomes were dominated by anammox bacteria (Fig. S2A and C). Also, no known EET-104 capable bacteria were detected in the metagenomes. Taken together, these results support that 105 anammox bacteria have EET capability. 106 107 Electroactivity of anammox bacteria 108 Electrochemical techniques provide a powerful tool to evaluate EET, where electrodes 109 substitute for the insoluble minerals as the terminal electron acceptor (13). Compared to metal 110 oxides, the use of electrodes as the terminal electron acceptor allow us to quantify the number of 111 externalized electrons per mol of NH4 + oxidized. Also, since the electrode is only used for bacterial 112 respiration, then we can better assess EET activity compared to metal oxides, where we cannot 113 differentiate between metal oxide reduction for nutritional acquisition from respiration through 114 EET activity. Therefore, we tested if anammox bacteria interact with electrodes via EET and use 115 them as the sole electron acceptor in MEC. Single-chamber MEC operated at eight different set 116 potentials (from -0.3 to 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl) using multiple working electrodes (Fig. S1H) were 117 initially operated under abiotic conditions with the addition of NH4 + only. No current and NH4 + 118 removal were observed in any of the abiotic controls. Subsequently, the Ca. Brocadia culture was 119 inoculated into the MEC and operated under optimal conditions for anammox (i.e., addition of 120 NH4 + and NO2 -). Under this scenario, NH4 + and NO2were completely removed from the medium 121 without any current generation (Fig. 2A). Stoichiometric ratios of consumed NO2 \u2212 to consumed 122 NH4 + (\u2206NO2 \u2212 /\u2206NH4 + ) and produced NO3 \u2212 to consumed NH4 + (\u2206NO3 \u2212 /\u2206NH4 + ) were in the range 123 of 1.0-1.3 and 0.12-0.18, respectively, which are close to the theoretical ratios of the anammox 124 reaction (18). These ratios indicated that anammox bacteria were responsible for NH4 + removal in 125 the MEC. Subsequently, NO2was gradually decreased to 0 mM leaving the electrodes as the sole 126 electron acceptor. When the exogenous electron acceptor (i.e., NO2 -) was completely removed 127 from the feed, anammox cells began to form a biofilm on the surface of the electrodes (Fig. S1I) 128 and current generation coupled to NH4 + oxidation was observed in the absence of NO2 -(Fig. 2A). 129 Further, NO2and NO3 \u2212 were below the detection limit at all time points when the working 130 electrode was used as the sole electron acceptor. The magnitude of current generation was 131 proportional to the NH4 + concentration (Fig. 2A) and maximum current density was observed at 132 set potential of 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. There was no visible biofilm growth and current generation at 133 set potentials \u2264 0 V vs Ag/AgCl. To confirm that the electrode-dependent anaerobic oxidation of 134 NH4 + was catalyzed by anammox bacteria, additional control experiments were conducted in 135 chronological order in the MEC. The presence of ATU, a compound that selectively inhibits 136 aerobic NH3 oxidation by ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) in ammonia oxidizing bacteria 137 (AOB), ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and Comammox (19), did not result in an inhibitory 138 effect on NH4 + removal and current generation (Fig. 2A). NH4 + was not oxidized when the MEC 139 was operated in open circuit voltage mode (OCV; electrode is not used as electron acceptor) (Fig. 140 2B), strongly suggesting an electrode-dependent NH4 + oxidation and that trace amounts of O2 if 141 present, are not responsible for NH4 + oxidation. Addition of NO2 \u2212 resulted in an immediate drop 142 in current density with simultaneous removal of NH4 + and NO2and formation of NO3 -, in the 143 expected stoichiometry (18) (Fig. 2C). Repeated addition of NO2 \u2212 resulted in the complete 144 abolishment of current generation, indicating that anammox bacteria were solely responsible for 145 current production in the absence of an exogenous electron acceptor. Absence of NH4 + from the 146 feed resulted in no current generation, and current was immediately resumed when NH4 + was 147 added again to the feed (Fig. 2D), further supporting the role of anammox bacteria in current 148 generation. These results also indicate that current generation was not catalyzed by 149 electrochemically active heterotrophs, which might utilize organic carbon generated from 150 endogenous decay processes. Autoclaving the MECs immediately stopped current generation and 151 NH4 + removal (Fig. 2D) indicating that current generation was due a biotic reaction. Similar results 152",

Scalindua or K. stuttgartiensis cultures (Fig. S3A   153 and B), suggesting that they are also electrochemically active and can oxidize NH4 + using working 154 electrodes as the electron acceptor. Taken together these results provide strong evidence for 155 electrode-dependent anaerobic oxidation of NH4 + by phylogenetically distant anammox bacteria. 156 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to correlate between current density and biofilm age, in 157 cell-free filtrates (filtered reactor solution) and the developed biofilms at different time intervals. 158 The anodes exhibited similar redox peaks with midpoint potentials (E1/2) of ~200 mV vs Standard 159 Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) for all three anammox species (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3C and D) . No redox 160 peaks were observed for the cell-free solution, indicating that soluble mediators are not involved 161 in EET. Also, addition of exogenous riboflavin, which is a common soluble mediator involved in 162 flavin-based EET process in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (13, 20), did not invoke 163 changes in current density. Thus, the CV analysis corroborated that the electrode biofilms were 164 responsible for current generation through direct EET mechanism. 165 The mole of electrons transferred to the electrode per mole of NH4 + oxidized to N2 (Table S1) 166 was stoichiometrically close to equation 1 (Eq. 1). Also, electron balance calculations showed that 167 coulombic efficiency (CE) was >80% for all NH4 + concentrations and anammox cultures tested in 168 the experiments with electrodes as the sole electron acceptor (Table S1 ).",

Brocadia were conducted 171 by operating single and double-chamber MECs in parallel (at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl applied potential). 172 However, there was no significant difference in NH4 + oxidation and current production between 173 the different reactor configurations (Fig. S4) , suggesting no influence of cathodic reaction (i.e., H2 174 recycling) on the process. This was further supported by electron balance and CE calculations 175 (Table S1 ). In addition, NH4 + oxidation and current production were not affected by the addition 176 of Penicillin G (Fig. S4) , a compound that has inhibitory effects in some heterotrophs but it does 177 not have any observable short-term effects on anammox activity (21, 22). This further supports 178 that current generation was not catalyzed by electrochemically active heterotrophs. Similar results 179 were obtained with Ca. Scalindua and K. stuttgartiensis (data not shown). 180 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed biofilm formation on the electrodes' surface 181 for the three tested anammox bacteria (Fig. S5 ). The biofilm cell density of MECs inoculated with 182 Ca. Brocadia was higher at 0.4 V ( Fig. S5E and F) compared to other set potentials, and no biofilm 183 was observed at set potentials \u2264 0 V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. S5A) . These observations correlate very 184 well with the obtained current profiles at different set potentials ( Fig. 2A) . Cell appendages 185 between cells and the electrode were not observed. Cell appearance was very similar to reported 186 SEM images of anammox cells (21). 187 FISH with anammox-specific probes (Fig. 2F) and metagenomics of DNA extracted from the 188 biofilm on the working electrodes of MECs showed that anammox were the most abundant 189 bacteria in the biofilm community (Fig. S2B and D). Also, no other known electrochemically 190 active bacteria were detected in the metagenomes. Similarly, AOB were not detected which further 191 supports the lack of ATU inhibition on NH4 + removal and current generation.

            "text": "To better understand how NH4 + is converted to N2 by anammox bacteria in electrode-201 dependent anammox process, isotope labelling experiments were carried out. Complete oxidation 202 of NH4 + to N2 was demonstrated by incubating the MECs with 15 NH4 + (4 mM) and 14 NO2 -(1 mM). 203 Consistent with expected anammox activity, anammox bacteria consumed first the 14 NO2 -204 resulting in the accumulation of 29 N2 in the headspace of the MECs. Interestingly, after depletion 205 of available 14 NO2 -, a steady increase of 30 N2 was observed with slower activity rates compared to 206 the typical anammox process (Fig 3A, Table S2 ). These results confirm the GO experiments where 207 30 N2 was detected when the three anammox species were incubated with 15 NH4 + (Fig. 1C) . Gas 208 production was not observed in the abiotic control incubations. In the current model of the 209 anammox reaction (Eq. 2) (4), NH4 + is converted to N2 with NO2as terminal electron acceptor. 210 This is a process in which first, NO2is reduced to nitric oxide (NO, Eq. 3) and subsequently 211 condensed with ammonia (NH3) to produce hydrazine (N2H4, Eq. 4), which is finally oxidized to 212 N2 (Eq. 5). The four low-potential electrons released during N2H4 oxidation fuel the reduction 213 reactions (Eq. 3 and 4), and are proposed to build up the membrane potential and establish a proton-214 motive force across the anammoxosome membrane driving the ATP synthesis. 215 NH4 + + NO2 -\u00ae N2 + 2H2O (DG 0\u00a2 = -357 kJ mol -1 ) (Eq. 2) NO2 -+2H + + e -\u00ae NO +H2O (E 0\u00a2 = +0.38 V) (Eq. 3) NO + NH4 + + 2H+ + 3e -\u00ae N2H4 +H2O (E 0\u00a2 = +0.06 V) (Eq. 4) N2H4 \u00ae N2 + 4H + + 4e -(E 0\u00a2 = -0.75 V) (Eq. 5) In the MEC experiments with Ca. Brocadia using electrodes as sole electron acceptor we 216 observed the production of NH2OH followed by a transient accumulation of N2H4 (Fig. S7). No 217 inhibitory effect was observed in incubations with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-218 oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) (Fig. S8), an NO scavenger (4). Therefore, we hypothesized that NH2OH, 219 and not NO, is an intermediate of the electrode-dependent anammox process. To investigate 220 whether NH2OH could be produced directly from NH4 + in electrode-dependent anammox process, 221 MECs were incubated with 15 NH4 + (4 mM) and 14 NH2OH (2 mM). The isotopic composition of 222 the reactors revealed that unlabeled 14 NH2OH was used as a pool substrate and we detected newly 223 synthetized 15 NH2OH from 15 NH4 + oxidation (Fig. 3B). It is known that NO and NH2OH, the 224 known intermediates in the anammox process, are strong competitive inhibitors of the N2H4 225 oxidation activity by the hydrazine dehydrogenase (HDH) (24). However, oxidation of N2H4 (Fig. 226 S7) and detection of 30 N2 (Fig. 3A) in our experiments, suggest that even though there might be 227 some inhibition caused by the NH2OH, the HDH is still active. Also, comparative transcriptomics 228 analysis of the electrode's biofilm revealed that the HDH was one of the most upregulated genes 229 when the electrode was used as the electron acceptor instead of NO2 -(Supplementary text). 230 Incubations with 15 NH4 + (4 mM) in 10% deuterium oxide (D2O) showed accumulation of 231 15 NH2OD, which suggests that in order to oxidize the NH4 + to NH2OH, the different anammox 232 bacteria use OHions generated from water (Fig. 3C). Abiotic incubations did not show any 233 production of NH2OH or NH2OD. Based on these results we propose the following reactions for 234 electrode-dependent anammox process: The complete NH4 + oxidation to N2 coupled with reproducible current production can only be 239 explained by electron transfer from the anammoxosome compartment (energetic central of 240 anammox cells and where the NH4 + is oxidized) to the electrode. In order to compare the pathway 241 of NH4 + oxidation and electron flow through compartments (anammoxosome) and membranes 242 (cytoplasm and periplasm) in EET-dependent anammox process (electrode poised at 0.4 V vs 243 Ag/AgCl as electron acceptor) versus typical anammox process (i.e., nitrite used as electron 244 acceptor), we conducted a genome-centric comparative transcriptomics analysis (Supplementary 245 text). In the anammoxosome compartment, the genes encoding for ammonium transporter (AmtB), 246 a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) and HDH were the most upregulated in response to the 247 electrode as the electron acceptor (Table S8) . This observation agrees with the NH4 + removal and 248 oxidation to N2 observed in the MECs and isotope labeling experiments ( Fig. 2A, Fig 3A) . The 249 genes encoding for NO and NO2reductases (nir genes) and their redox couples were significantly 250 downregulated when electrode was used as the electron acceptor (Table S8 ). This is expected as 251 NO2was not added in the electrode-dependent anammox process. Also, this supports the 252 hypothesis that NO is not an intermediate of the electrode-dependent anammox process and that 253 there was no effect of PTIO when NO2was replaced by the electrode as electron acceptor (Fig. 254 S8). Isotope labelling experiments revealed that NH2OH was the intermediate in EET-dependent 255 anammox process and NO was not detected throughout the experiment (Fig. 3B) , suggesting that 256 the production of NH2OH was not through NO reduction. This was further supported by the 257 observation that the electron transfer module (ETM) and its redox partner whose function is to 258 provide electrons to the hydrazine synthase (HZS) for NO reduction to NH2OH were 259 downregulated (Table S6) . Interestingly, our analysis revealed that the electrons released from the 260 N2H4 oxidation (Eq. 8) are transferred to the electrode via an EET pathway that is analog to the 261 ones present in metal-reducing organisms such as Geobacter spp. and Shewanella spp. (Fig. S10 , 262 Supplementary text). Highly expressed cytoplasmic electron carriers such as NADH and 263 ferredoxins can be oxidized at the cytoplasmic membrane by NADH dehydrogenase (NADH-DH) 264 and/or formate dehydrogenase (FDH) to directly reduce the menaquinone pool inside the 265 cytoplasmic membrane (Supplementary materials, Table S3). An upregulated protein similar to 266 CymA (tetraheme c-type cytochrome) in Shewanella would then oxidize the reduced 267 menaquinones, delivering electrons to highly upregulated periplasmic cytochromes shuttles and to 268 a porin-cytochrome complex that spans the outer membrane (Fig. S10, Table S3, Supplementary 269 materials). From this complex, electrons could be directly accepted by the insoluble extracellular 270 electron acceptor. Taken together, the results from the comparative transcriptomics analysis 271",

            "text": "Abstract: Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) by anammox bacteria contributes 21 significantly to the global nitrogen cycle, and plays a major role in sustainable wastewater 22 treatment. Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4 + ) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite (NO2 -23 ) or nitric oxide (NO) as the electron acceptor. In the absence of NO2or NO, anammox bacteria 24 can couple formate oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV). Their 25 genomes contain homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella cytochromes involved in extracellular 26 electron transfer (EET). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have EET 27 capability and can couple the oxidation of NH4 + with transfer of electrons to carbon-based 28 insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show using complementary approaches that in 29 the absence of NO2 -, freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4 + with 30 transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene 31 oxide (GO) or electrodes poised at a certain potential in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). 32 Metagenomics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and electrochemical analyses coupled with 33 MEC performance confirmed that anammox electrode biofilms were responsible for current 34 generation through EET-dependent oxidation of NH4 + . 15 N-labelling experiments revealed the 35 molecular mechanism of the EET-dependent anammox process. NH4 + was oxidized to N2 via 36 hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate when electrode was the terminal electron acceptor. 37 Comparative transcriptomics analysis supported isotope labelling experiments and revealed an 38 alternative pathway for NH4 + oxidation coupled to EET when electrode is used as electron acceptor 39 compared to NO2as electron acceptor. To our knowledge, our results provide the first 40 experimental evidence that marine and freshwater anammox bacteria can couple NH4 + oxidation 41 with EET, which is a significant finding, and challenges our perception of a key player of anaerobic 42 oxidation of NH4 + in natural environments and engineered systems. 43 Main text: Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) by anammox bacteria contributes up to 44 50% of N2 emitted into Earth's atmosphere from the oceans (1, 2). Also, anammox bacteria has 45 been extensively investigated for energy-efficient removal of NH4 + from wastewater (3). Initially, 46 anammox bacteria were assumed to be restricted to NH4 + as electron donor and NO2or NO as 47 electron acceptor (4, 5). More than a decade ago, preliminary experiments showed that Kuenenia 48 stuttgartiensis and Scalindua could couple the oxidation of formate to the reduction of insoluble 49 extracellular electron acceptors such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV) oxides (6, 7). However, the mechanism 50 of how anammox bacteria reduce insoluble extracellular electron acceptors has remained 51 unexplored to date. Also, growth or electrochemical activity was not quantified in these 52 experiments. Further, these experiments could not discriminate between Fe(III) oxide reduction 53 for nutritional acquisition (i.e., via siderophores) versus respiration through extracellular electron 54 transfer (EET) (8). Therefore, with these preliminary experiments it could not be determined if 55 anammox bacteria have EET capability or not. 56 Although preliminary work showed that K. stuttgartiensis could not reduce Mn(IV) or Fe(III) 57 with NH4 + as electron donor (6), the possibility of anammox bacteria to oxidize NH4 + coupled to 58 EET to other insoluble extracellular electron acceptors cannot be ruled out. In fact EET (and set 59 of genes involved with EET) is not uniformly applied to all insoluble extracellular electron 60 acceptors; some electroactive bacteria are not able to transfer electrons to carbon-based insoluble 61 extracellular electron acceptors such as electrodes in bioelectrochemical systems but could reduce 62 metal oxides and vice versa (9). It is known for more than two decades that carbon-based high-63 molecular-weight organic materials, which are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments 64 and that are not involved in microbial metabolism (i.e., humic substances) can be used as external 65 electron acceptor for the anaerobic oxidation of compounds (10). Also, it has been reported that 66 anaerobic NH4 + oxidation linked to microbial reduction of natural organic matter fuels nitrogen 67 loss in marine sediments (11). A literature survey of more than 100 EET-capable species indicated 68 that there are many ecological niches for microorganisms able to perform EET (12) . This resonates 69 with a recent finding where Listeria monocytogenes, a host-associated pathogen and fermentative 70 Gram-positive bacterium, was able to respire through a flavin-based EET process and behaved as 71 an electrochemically active microorganism (i.e., able to transfer electrons from oxidized fuel 72 (substrate) to a working electrode via EET process) (13). Further it was reported that anammox 73 bacteria seem to have homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella multi-heme cytochromes that are 74 responsible for EET (14). These observations stimulated us to investigate whether anammox 75 bacteria can couple NH4 + oxidation with EET to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron 76 acceptor and can behave as electrochemically active bacteria. (Fig. S1B-G) . Also, a previously enriched K. stuttgartiensis (freshwater anammox 86 species) culture was used (4). The anammox cells were incubated anoxically for 216 hours in the 87 presence of 15 NH4 + (4 mM) and graphene oxide (GO) as a proxy for insoluble electron acceptor. 88 No NO2or NO3were added to the incubations. GO particles are bigger than bacterial cells and 89 cannot be internalized, and thus GO can only be reduced by EET (16). Indeed, GO was reduced 90 by anammox bacteria as shown by the formation of suspended reduced GO (rGO), which is black 91 in color and insoluble (Fig. 1A) (16). In contrast, abiotic controls did not form insoluble black 92 precipitates. Reduction of GO to rGO by anammox bacteria was further confirmed by Raman 93 spectroscopy, where the formation of the characteristic 2D and D+D\u00a2 peaks of rGO (17) were 94 detected in the vials with anammox cells (Fig. 1B) , whereas no peaks were detected in the abiotic 95 control. Further, isotope analysis of the produced N2 gas showed that anammox cells were capable 96 of 30 N2 formation (Fig. 1C ). In contrast, 29 N2 production was not significant in any of the tested 97 anammox species or controls, suggesting that unlabeled NO2or NO3were not involved. The 98 production of 30 N2 indicated that the anammox cultures use a different mechanism for NH4 + 99 oxidation in the presence of an insoluble extracellular electron acceptor (further explained below). 100 Gas production was not observed in the abiotic control (Fig. 1C) . To determine if anammox 101 bacteria are still dominant after incubation with GO, we extracted and sequenced total DNA from 102 the Brocadia and Scalindua vials at the end of the experiment. Differential coverage showed that 103 the metagenomes were dominated by anammox bacteria (Fig. S2A removal were observed in any of the abiotic controls. Subsequently, the Ca. Brocadia culture was 119 inoculated into the MEC and operated under optimal conditions for anammox (i.e., addition of 120 NH4 + and NO2 -). Under this scenario, NH4 + and NO2were completely removed from the medium 121 without any current generation ( Fig. 2A) . Stoichiometric ratios of consumed NO2 \u2212 to consumed 122 NH4 + (\u2206NO2 \u2212 /\u2206NH4 + ) and produced NO3 \u2212 to consumed NH4 + (\u2206NO3 \u2212 /\u2206NH4 + ) were in the range 123 of 1.0-1.3 and 0.12-0.18, respectively, which are close to the theoretical ratios of the anammox 124 reaction (18). These ratios indicated that anammox bacteria were responsible for NH4 + removal in 125 the MEC. Subsequently, NO2was gradually decreased to 0 mM leaving the electrodes as the sole 126 electron acceptor. When the exogenous electron acceptor (i.e., NO2 -) was completely removed 127 from the feed, anammox cells began to form a biofilm on the surface of the electrodes (Fig. S1I ) 128 and current generation coupled to NH4 + oxidation was observed in the absence of NO2 -( Fig. 2A) . 129 Further, NO2and NO3 \u2212 were below the detection limit at all time points when the working 130 electrode was used as the sole electron acceptor. The magnitude of current generation was 131 proportional to the NH4 + concentration ( Fig. 2A) and maximum current density was observed at 132 set potential of 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. There was no visible biofilm growth and current generation at The mole of electrons transferred to the electrode per mole of NH4 + oxidized to N2 (Table S1) 166 was stoichiometrically close to equation 1 (Eq. 1). Also, electron balance calculations showed that 167 coulombic efficiency (CE) was >80% for all NH4 + concentrations and anammox cultures tested in 168 the experiments with electrodes as the sole electron acceptor (Table S1 ). (Table S1 ). In addition, NH4 + oxidation and current production were not affected by the addition 176 of Penicillin G (Fig. S4) (Table S8) . This observation agrees with the NH4 + removal and 248 oxidation to N2 observed in the MECs and isotope labeling experiments ( Fig. 2A, Fig 3A) . The 249 genes encoding for NO and NO2reductases (nir genes) and their redox couples were significantly 250 downregulated when electrode was used as the electron acceptor (Table S8 ). This is expected as 251 NO2was not added in the electrode-dependent anammox process. Also, this supports the 252 hypothesis that NO is not an intermediate of the electrode-dependent anammox process and that 253 there was no effect of PTIO when NO2was replaced by the electrode as electron acceptor ( suggest an alternative pathway for NH4 + oxidation coupled to EET when working electrode is used 272 as electron acceptor compared to NO2as electron acceptor. 273 In conclusion, our study provides the first experimental evidence that phylogenetically and ",

NH4 + was not oxidized when the MEC 139 was operated in open circuit voltage mode (OCV; electrode is not used as electron acceptor) (Fig. 140 2B), strongly suggesting an electrode-dependent NH4 + oxidation and that trace amounts of O2 if 141 present, are not responsible for NH4 + oxidation. Addition of NO2 \u2212 resulted in an immediate drop 142 in current density with simultaneous removal of NH4 + and NO2and formation of NO3 -, in the 143 expected stoichiometry (18) (Fig. 2C). Repeated addition of NO2 \u2212 resulted in the complete 144 abolishment of current generation, indicating that anammox bacteria were solely responsible for 145 current production in the absence of an exogenous electron acceptor. Absence of NH4 + from the 146 feed resulted in no current generation, and current was immediately resumed when NH4 + was 147 added again to the feed (Fig. 2D), further supporting the role of anammox bacteria in current 148 generation. These results also indicate that current generation was not catalyzed by 149 electrochemically active heterotrophs, which might utilize organic carbon generated from 150 endogenous decay processes. Autoclaving the MECs immediately stopped current generation and 151 NH4 + removal (Fig. 2D) indicating that current generation was due a biotic reaction. Similar results 152were also obtained with MECs operated with Ca. Scalindua or K. stuttgartiensis cultures(Fig. S3A 153and B), suggesting that they are also electrochemically active and can oxidize NH4 + using working 154 electrodes as the electron acceptor. Taken together these results provide strong evidence for 155 electrode-dependent anaerobic oxidation of NH4 + by phylogenetically distant anammox bacteria.156    Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to correlate between current density and biofilm age, inThe anodes exhibited similar redox peaks with midpoint potentials (E1/2) of ~200 mV vs Standard 159 Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) for all three anammox species(Fig. 2E and Fig. S3C and D). No redox 160 peaks were observed for the cell-free solution, indicating that soluble mediators are not involved 161 in EET. Also, addition of exogenous riboflavin, which is a common soluble mediator involved in162    flavin-based EET process in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (13, 20), did not invoke 163 changes in current density.

Brocadia was higher at 0.4 V (Fig. S5Eand F) compared to other set potentials, and no biofilm183    was observed at set potentials \u2264 0 V vs Ag/AgCl(Fig. S5A). These observations correlate very184    well with the obtained current profiles at different set potentials (Fig. 2A). Cell appendages185    between cells and the electrode were not observed. Cell appearance was very similar to reported186 SEM images of anammox cells (21). 187 FISH with anammox-specific probes (Fig. 2F) and metagenomics of DNA extracted from the 188 biofilm on the working electrodes of MECs showed that anammox were the most abundant 189 bacteria in the biofilm community (Fig. S2B and D). Also, no other known electrochemically 190 active bacteria were detected in the metagenomes. Similarly, AOB were not detected which further 191 supports the lack of ATU inhibition on NH4 + removal and current generation. By differential 192 coverage and sequence composition-based binning (23) it was possible to extract high-quality 193 genomes of Brocadia and Scalindua species from the electrodes (Fig. S2B and 2D). Based on the 194 differences in the genome content, average amino acid identity (AAI) \u226495% compared to reported 195 anammox genomes to date, and evolutionary divergence in phylogenomics analysis (Fig. S6) we 196 propose a tentative name for Ca. Brocadia present in our MECs: Candidatus Brocadia electricigens 197 (etymology: L. adj. electricigens; electricity generator). 198 199 Molecular mechanism of EET-dependent anammox process 200To better understand how NH4 + is converted to N2 by anammox bacteria in electrode-201 dependent anammox process, isotope labelling experiments were carried out. Complete oxidation 202 of NH4 + to N2 was demonstrated by incubating the MECs with 15 NH4 + (4 mM) and 14 NO2 -(1 mM).203    Consistent with expected anammox activity, anammox bacteria consumed first the 14 NO2 -204 resulting in the accumulation of 29 N2 in the headspace of the MECs. Interestingly, after depletion 205 of available 14 NO2 -, a steady increase of 30 N2 was observed with slower activity rates compared to206    the typical anammox process(Fig 3A, Table S2). These results confirm the GO experiments where 207 30 N2 was detected when the three anammox species were incubated with 15 NH4 +(Fig. 1C). Gas 208 production was not observed in the abiotic control incubations. In the current model of the 209 anammox reaction (Eq. 2) (4), NH4 + is converted to N2 with NO2as terminal electron acceptor.210    This is a process in which first, NO2is reduced to nitric oxide (NO, Eq. 3) and subsequently211 condensed with ammonia (NH3) to produce hydrazine (N2H4, Eq. 4), which is finally oxidized to 212 N2 (Eq. 5). The four low-potential electrons released during N2H4 oxidation fuel the reduction 213 reactions (Eq. 3 and 4), and are proposed to build up the membrane potential and establish a proton-214 motive force across the anammoxosome membrane driving the ATP synthesis. 215 NH4 + + NO2 -\u00ae N2 + 2H2O (DG 0\u00a2 = -357 kJ mol -1 ) (Eq. 2) NO2 -+2H + + e -\u00ae NO +H2O (E 0\u00a2 = +0.38 V) (Eq. 3) NO + NH4 + + 2H+ + 3e -\u00ae N2H4 +H2O (E 0\u00a2 = +0.06 V) (Eq. 4) N2H4 \u00ae N2 + 4H + + 4e -(E 0\u00a2 = -0.75 V) (Eq. 5) In the MEC experiments with Ca. Brocadia using electrodes as sole electron acceptor we 216 observed the production of NH2OH followed by a transient accumulation of N2H4 (Fig. S7). No 217 inhibitory effect was observed in incubations with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-218 oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO)(Fig. S8), an NO scavenger (4). Therefore, we hypothesized that NH2OH,219    and not NO, is an intermediate of the electrode-dependent anammox process. To investigate 220 whether NH2OH could be produced directly from NH4 + in electrode-dependent anammox process,221    MECs were incubated with 15 NH4 + (4 mM) and 14 NH2OH (2 mM). The isotopic composition of 222 the reactors revealed that unlabeled 14 NH2OH was used as a pool substrate and we detected newly 223 synthetized 15 NH2OH from 15 NH4 + oxidation(Fig. 3B). It is known that NO and NH2OH, the224 known intermediates in the anammox process, are strong competitive inhibitors of the N2H4 225 oxidation activity by the hydrazine dehydrogenase (HDH) (24). However, oxidation of N2H4 (Fig. 226 S7) and detection of 30 N2 (Fig. 3A) in our experiments, suggest that even though there might be 227 some inhibition caused by the NH2OH, the HDH is still active. Also, comparative transcriptomics 228 analysis of the electrode's biofilm revealed that the HDH was one of the most upregulated genes 229 when the electrode was used as the electron acceptor instead of NO2 -(Supplementary text). 230 Incubations with 15 NH4 + (4 mM) in 10% deuterium oxide (D2O) showed accumulation of 231 15 NH2OD, which suggests that in order to oxidize the NH4 + to NH2OH, the different anammox 232 bacteria use OHions generated from water (Fig. 3C). Abiotic incubations did not show any 233 production of NH2OH or NH2OD. Based on these results we propose the following reactions NH4 + oxidation to N2 coupled with reproducible current production can only be 239 explained by electron transfer from the anammoxosome compartment (energetic central of 240 anammox cells and where the NH4 + is oxidized) to the electrode. In order to compare the pathway 241 of NH4 + oxidation and electron flow through compartments (anammoxosome) and membranes 242 (cytoplasm and periplasm) in EET-dependent anammox process (electrode poised at 0.4 V vs 243 Ag/AgCl as electron acceptor) versus typical anammox process (i.e., nitrite used as electron 244 acceptor), we conducted a genome-centric comparative transcriptomics analysis (Supplementary 245 text). In the anammoxosome compartment, the genes encoding for ammonium transporter (AmtB), 246 a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) and HDH were the most upregulated in response to the 247 electrode as the electron acceptor",

Different anammox bacteria can perform EET by coupling the oxidation of NH4 + 604 with the reduction of GO. (A) Photographs of serum vials after 216 hours of incubation with 605 different species of anammox bacteria, 15 NH4 + and GO. The presence of black precipitates 606 indicates the formation of reduced GO (rGO). No obvious change in color was observed in the 607 abiotic control vials after the same period of incubation with 15 NH4 + and GO. (B) Raman spectra 608 of the vials after 216 hours of incubation. Peaks in bands of 2D and D + D\u00a2 located at \u223c2700 and 609 \u223c2900 cm -1 , respectively, indicate the formation of rGO. (C) 30 N2 production by different 610 anammox bacteria from 15 NH4 + and GO as the sole electron acceptor. Anammox cells were 611 incubated with 4 mM 15 NH4 + and GO to a final concentration of 200 mg L -1 . There was no 29 N2 612 formation throughout the experiment. NO and N2O were not detected throughout the experiment. 613 Results from triplicate serum vial experiments are represented as mean \u00b1 SD. Ca. Brocadia is electrochemically active (i.e., able to release electrons from inside 616 the cell to working electrode). (A to D) Ammonium oxidation coupled to current generation in 617 chronoamperometry experiment conducted in single-chamber multiple working electrode MEC 618 inoculated with Ca. Brocadia. (A) MEC operated initially under different set potentials with 619 addition of nitrite, which is the preferred electron acceptor for ammonium oxidation by anammox 620 bacteria, followed by operation with working electrodes as sole electron acceptors. The highlighted 621 area in blue refers to the operation of MEC in the presence of nitrite. The black arrow indicates 622 the addition of ATU, a compound that selectively inhibits nitrifiers. (B) MEC operated under open 623 circuit voltage (OCV) mode. (C) MEC operated at different set potentials and with addition of 624 nitrite. (D) MEC operated at different set potentials and without addition of ammonium and then 625 with addition of ammonium followed by autoclaving. The black arrow in (D) indicates autoclaving 626 followed by re-connecting of the MECs. Red dashed lines in (MEC. (F) Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of a thin cross-section of the 630 graphite rod anodes (0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl applied potential). The images are showing the in-situ 631 spatial organization of all bacteria (green), anammox bacteria (red) and the merged micrograph 632 (yellow). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization was performed with EUB I, II and III probes for all 633 bacteria and Alexa647-labeled Amx820 probe for anammox bacteria. The dotted outline indicates 634 the graphite rod anode surface. The white arrow indicates the biofilm. The scale bars Molecular mechanism of electrode-dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation by 639 different anammox bacteria. (A) Time course of the anaerobic oxidation of 15 NH4 + to 29 N2 and 640 30 N2. The single-chamber MECs with mature biofilm on the working electrodes operated at 0.4 V 641 vs Ag/AgCl were fed with 4 mM 15 NH4 + and 1 mM 14 NO2 -. Under these conditions, anammox 642 bacteria will consume first the preferred electron acceptor (i.e., 14 NO2 -) and form 29 N2 and then the 643 remaining 15 NH4 + will be oxidized to the final product ( 30 N2) through the electrode-dependent 644 anammox process. NO and N2O were not detected throughout the experiment. Results from 645 triplicate MEC reactors are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. (B) Determination of NH2OH as the 646 intermediate of the electrode-dependent anammox process. The MECs with mature biofilm on the 647 working electrodes operated at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl were fed with 4 mM 15 NH4 + and 2 mM 14 NH2OH. 648 Under these conditions, anammox bacteria would preferentially consume the unlabelled pool of 649 hydroxylamine (i.e., 14 NH2OH), leading to the accumulation of 15 NH2OH due to the oxidation of 650 15 NH4 + . Samples were derivatized using acetone, and isotopic ratios were determined by gas 651 chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results from triplicate MEC reactors are presented 652 as mean \u00b1 SD. (C) Ion mass chromatograms of hydroxylamine derivatization with acetone. The 653 MECs with mature biofilm (Ca. Brocadia) on the working electrodes operated at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl 654 were fed with 4 mM 15 NH4 + and 10% D2O. The mass to charge (m/z) of 73, 74 and 75 corresponds 655 to derivatization products of 14 NH2OH, 15 NH2OH, and 15 NH2OD, respectively with acetone 656 determined by GC/MS. 25 \u00b5M of 14 NH2OH and 15 NH2OH were used as standards. The 73 m/z 657 (top) at retention time of 8.6 minutes arises from the acetone used for derivatization. The 75 m/z 658 (bottom) accumulation over the course of the experiment indicates that the oxygen used in the 659 anaerobic oxidation of ammonium originates from OHof the water molecule. upflow column reactors (XK 50/60 Column, GE Healthcare, UK) with Ca. Brocadia 690 and Ca. Scalindua were harvested and used as inoculum. Ca. Brocadia and Ca. Scalindua 691 planktonic cells were enriched in two bioreactors (BioFlo\u00ae115, New Brunswick, USA) equipped 692 with a microfiltration (average pore size 0.1 \u00b5m) hollow fiber membrane module (zena-membrane, 693 Czech Republic) (Fig. S1A). Operating conditions of the membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were 694 described previously (15). The MBRs were operated at pH 7.5-8.0 and 35\u00b11\u00b0C for Brocadia and 695 room temperature (20-25 C) for Scalindua. The culture liquid in the MBRs was continuously 696 mixed with a metal propeller at a stirring speed of 150 rpm and purged with 95% Ar -5% CO2 at 697 a flow rate of 10 mL min \u22121 to maintain anaerobic conditions. Inorganic synthetic medium was fed 698 continuously to the reactors at a rate of ~5 L d \u22121 and hydraulic retention time was maintained at 699 one day. The synthetic medium was prepared by adding the following constituents; NH4 + (2.trace element solutions (25). In the case of Ca. Scalindua culture, the synthetic medium 702 was prepared using non-sterilized Red Sea water. Samples for microbial community 703 characterization were taken from the MBRs for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 704 metagenomics analysis (See FISH and DNA extraction, metagenome library preparation, 705 sequencing and sequence processing and analysis sections below). A previously enriched K. 706 stuttgartiensis culture was also used for the experiments (4). 707 Incubation of anammox bacteria in serum vials with NH4 + and graphene oxide as the 709 insoluble extracellular electron acceptor 710 To test whether anammox bacteria have extracellular electron transfer (EET) capability, the three 711 enriched anammox cultures were incubated in serum vials for 216 hours with 15 NH4 + and graphene 712 oxide (GO) as a proxy for insoluble extracellular electron acceptor. Standard anaerobic techniques 713 were employed in the batch incubation experiments. All the procedures were performed in the 714 anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products; Grass Lake Charter Township, MI, USA). Anoxic 715 buffers and solutions were prepared by repeatedly vacuuming and purging helium gas (>99.99%) 716 before experiments. Biomass from the MBRs was centrifuged, washed twice and suspended in 717 inorganic medium containing 2 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, 718 pH 7.8) prior to inoculation into the vials. The same composition of the inorganic medium used in 719 the MBRs was supplied to the vials. Cell suspension was dispensed into 100 mL glass serum vials, 720 which were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps. Biomass concentration in the 721 vials ranged from 0.1-0.9 mg-protein mL -1 . The headspace of the serum vials was replaced by 722 repeatedly vacuuming and purging with pure (>99.99%) helium gas. Positive pressure (50-75 kPa) 723 was added to the headspace to prevent unintentional contamination with ambient air during the 724 incubation and gas sampling. Prior the addition of 15 NH4 + , the vials were pre-incubated overnight 725 at room temperature (~25\u00b0C) to remove any trace amounts of substrates and oxygen. The activity 726 test was initiated by adding 4 mM of 15 NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and GO to a final 727 concentration of 200 mg L -1 using a gas-tight syringe (VICI; Baton Rouge, LA, USA",

            "text": "if anammox bacteria (Ca. Brocadia and Ca. Scalindua) are electrochemically active, 747 single-chamber multiple working electrode glass reactors with 500 mL working volume were 748 operated in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) mode. The working electrodes (anodes) were 749 graphite rods of 8 cm length (7.5 cm inside the reactor) and 0.5 cm in diameter. Platinum mesh 750 was used as counter electrode (cathode) and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode (Bioanalytical 751 Systems, Inc.). A schematic representation of the multiple working electrode microbial electrolysis 752 cell (MEC) is presented in Fig. S1H. The multiple working electrodes were operated at a set 753 potential of -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. Amperometric current was 754 monitored continuously using a VMP3 potentiostat (BioLogic Science Instruments, USA), with 755 measurements every 60 s and analyzed using EC-lab V 10.02 software. To evaluate if K. 756 stuttgartiensis is electrochemically active, experiments were conducted in single-chamber MECs 757 (300 mL working volume) with carbon cloth working electrode (0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl). The reactors 758 and working and counter electrodes were sterilized by autoclaving prior to the start of the 759 experiments. The reference electrodes were sterilized by soaking in 3 M NaCl overnight and 760 rinsing with sterile medium. After the reactors were assembled, epoxy glue was used to seal every 761 opening in the reactor to avoid leakage. Gas bags (0.1 L Cali -5 -Bond. Calibrate, Inc.) were 762 connected to the MECs to collect any gas generated. The gas composition in the gas bags was 763 analyzed using a gas chromatograph (SRI 8610C gas chromatograph, SRI Instruments). 764 The inorganic medium composition in the MECs was the same as the one supplied in the MBRs 765 (See Enrichment and cultivation of anammox bacteria section above), with variations in the NH4 + 766 and/or NO2concentration. After preparation, the inorganic medium was boiled, sparged with 767 N2:CO2 (80:20) gas mix for 30 min to remove any dissolved oxygen and finally autoclaved. The 768 autoclaved medium was cooled down to room temperature inside the anaerobic chamber (Coy 769 Laboratory, USA). Prior to the experiments, KHCO3 was weighed in the anaerobic chamber and 770 dissolved in the medium. The reactors were operated in fed batch mode at 30\u00b0C for Ca. Brocadia 771 and K. stuttgartiensis cultures and at room temperature (~25\u00b0C) for Ca. Scalindua. The medium 772 in the MECs was gently mixed with a magnetic stirrer throughout the course of the experiments. 773 The pH of the MECs was not controlled but was at all times between 7.0-7.5. To exclude the effect 774 of abiotic (i.e., non-Faradaic) current, initial operation of the reactors was done without any 775 biomass addition. After biomass inoculation, the MECs were operated with set potentials and 776 optimal conditions for the anammox reaction (i.e., addition of NH4 + and NO2 -). Afterwards, NO2 -777 was gradually decreased to 0 mM leaving the working electrodes as the sole electron acceptor. To 778 confirm that the electrode-dependent anaerobic oxidation of NH4 + was catalyzed by anammox 779 bacteria, additional control experiments were conducted in chronological order including addition 780 of allylthiourea (ATU), operation in open circuit voltage mode (i.e., anodes were not connected to 781 the potentiostat; electrode is not used as electron acceptor), addition of nitrite, operation without 782 addition of NH4 + and then with addition of NH4 + , and autoclaving. ATU was added to a final 783 concentration of 100 \u03bcM to evaluate the contribution of nitrifiers to the process (19). Biomass from 784 a nitrifying reactor was incubated in triplicate vials with 100 \u03bcM of ATU and was used as a positive 785 control for the inhibitory effect of ATU. Throughout the reactor operation, the concentrations of 786 NH4 + , NO2 \u2212 , and NO3 \u2212 were determined as described below (See Analytical methods section). All 787 experiments were done in triplicate MECs, unless mentioned otherwise. 788 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 1mV s -1 was performed for the anodic biofilms at 789 different time intervals following initial inoculation to determine their redox behavior. Scans 790 ranged from \u22120.8 to 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. Current was normalized to the geometric anode surface 791 area. To determine the presence of extracellular secreted redox mediators by anodic communities, 792 CVs were performed with cell-free filtrates (filtered using a 0.2 mm pore diameter filter) collected 793 from the reactors and placed in separate sterile electrochemical cells. Also, experiments were 794 conducted to evaluate the effect of adding riboflavin, which is a common soluble mediator 795 involved in EET in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (13, 20). Riboflavin was added to 796 the mature anammox biofilm to a final concentration of 250 nM (20). 797 To test if cathodic reaction (i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction) has an effect on electrode-798 dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation, experiments were also conducted in double-chamber 799 MECs (Fig. S1K) with a single carbon cloth working electrode (0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl). The anode 800 and cathode chambers in double-chamber MECs were separated by a protonthe role of NO in the electrode-dependent anammox metabolism, oxide (PTIO), an NO scavenger. MECs with 4 mM NH4 + and without PTIO addition 807 were run in parallel as negative control. PTIO inhibits K. stuttgartiensis activity when NO is an 808 intermediate of the anammox reaction (4), therefore vials with K. stuttgartiensis were used as 809 positive control of the effect of PTIO. Liquid samples were taken every day and filtered using a 810 0.2 mm filter and subjected to determination of NH4 + concentration as described below Adams & Chittenden Scientific Glass, USA) with a single carbon cloth working electrode (0.4 V 814 vs Ag/AgCl) and 300 mL working volume were used (Fig. S1J). 815 816 15 N tracer batch experiments in MECs 817 To elucidate the molecular mechanism of electrode-dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation by 818 different anammox bacteria, isotopic labelling experiments were conducted in single-chamber 819 MECs operated at set potential of 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. All batch incubation experiments were 820 performed in triplicate MECs. MEC incubations without biomass for the 15 N tracer batch 821 experiments were also prepared to exclude any possibility of an abiotic reaction. Standard 822 anaerobic techniques were employed in the batch incubation experiments. All the procedures were 823 performed in the anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products;",

Electrochemical techniques provide a powerful tool to evaluate EET, where electrodes 109 substitute for the insoluble minerals as the terminal electron acceptor (13). Compared to metal 110 oxides, the use of electrodes as the terminal electron acceptor allow us to quantify the number of 111 externalized electrons per mol of NH4 + oxidized. Also, since the electrode is only used for bacterial 112 respiration, then we can better assess EET activity compared to metal oxides, where we cannot 113 differentiate between metal oxide reduction for nutritional acquisition from respiration through 114 EET activity. Therefore, we tested if anammox bacteria interact with electrodes via EET and use 115 them as the sole electron acceptor in MEC. Single-chamber MEC operated at eight different set 116 potentials (from -0.3 to 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl) using multiple working electrodes (Fig. S1H) were 117 initially operated under abiotic conditions with the addition of NH4 + only.

Interestingly, our analysis revealed that the electrons released from the 260 N2H4 oxidation (Eq. 8) are transferred to the electrode via an EET pathway that is analog to the 261 ones present in metal-reducing organisms such as Geobacter spp. and Shewanella spp.(Fig. S10, Supplementary text). Highly expressed cytoplasmic electron carriers such as NADH and 263 ferredoxins can be oxidized at the cytoplasmic membrane by NADH dehydrogenase (NADH-DH) 264 and/or formate dehydrogenase (FDH) to directly reduce the menaquinone pool inside the 265 cytoplasmic membrane (Supplementary materials,Table S3). An upregulated protein similar to CymA (tetraheme c-type cytochrome) in Shewanella would then oxidize the reduced 267 menaquinones, delivering electrons to highly upregulated periplasmic cytochromes shuttles and to 268 a porin-cytochrome complex that spans the outer membrane(Fig. S10, Table S3, Supplementary 269 materials).

Purity of 15 N-labelled compounds was greater than 99%. The headspace of the MECs was replaced by repeatedly vacuuming and purging with pure 827 (>99.99%) helium gas. Positive pressure (50-75 kPa) was added to the headspace to prevent 828 unintentional contamination with ambient air during the incubation and gas sampling. Oxidation 829 of NH4 + to N2 was demonstrated by incubating the MECs with 15 NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 4 mM) and 14 NO2 -(1 mM).

The activity was normalized against protein content of the biofilm on the electrodes. 859 Protein content was measured as described below (See Analytical methods section). 860 The moles of electrons recovered as current per mole of NH4 + oxidized were calculated using: Analytical methods 870 All samples were filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore-size syringe filters (Pall corporation) prior to 871 chemical analysis. NH4 + concentration was determined photometrically using the indophenol 872 method (28) (lower detection limit = 5 \u03bcM). Absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm was 873 determined using multi-label plate readers (SpectraMax Plus 384; Molecular Devices, CA, USA). 874 NO2concentration was determined by the naphthylethylenediamine method (28) (lower detection 875 limit = 5 \u03bcM). Samples were mixed with 4.9 mM naphthylethylenediamine solution, and the 876 absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 540 nm. NO3concentration was measured by HACH 877 kits (HACH, CO, USA; lower detection limit = 0.01 mg l -1 NO3 --N). User's guide was followed 878 for these kits and concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer (D5000, HACH, CO, 879 USA). Concentrations of NH2OH and hydrazine (N2H4) were determined colorimetrically as 880 previously described (29). For NH2OH, liquid samples were mixed with 8-quinolinol solution 881 (0.48% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 0.2% (w/v) 8-hydroxyquinoline and 0.2 M Na2CO3) and heated 882 at 100\u00b0C for 1 min.

The concentration of biomass on the working electrodes was determined as 885 protein concentration using DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) according to 886 manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. Putative EET-dependent anammox pathway 1031 We provided evidence that phylogenetically distant anammox bacteria can perform EET and are 1032 electrochemically active, and we elucidated the molecular mechanism of NH4 + oxidation, which 1033 by itself are significant findings that changes our perception of a key player in the global nitrogen (Table S3 and Table S8 ). This result is consistent with the NH4 + uptake, oxidation and 1066 final conversion to N2 observed in the MECs and isotope labeling experiments ( Fig. 2A, Fig 3A) . 1067 The requirement of more moles of NH4 + when anammox growth is based on EET compared to 1068 NO2as electron acceptor (Eq. 1), increases the demand of NH4 + import into the cell, which can 1069 explain the upregulation of the ammonium transporters. In contrast, the genes encoding for NO 1070 and NO2reductases (nir genes) and their redox couples were significantly downregulated ( Fig.   1071 S10, Table S8 ). This agrees, with the fact that NO2and NO3were below the detection limit in 1072 the MECs (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3A and B) and there was no effect of PTIO when NO2was replaced by 1073 electrode as electron acceptor (Fig. S8) (Fig. 4) . The four low-potential 1117 electrons released from this reaction must be stored until they are transferred to a redox partner (Fig. 2E, Fig. S3C and D) exhibited oxidation/reduction peaks, which suggests that additional 1182 cytochrome(s) that transfer electrons directly to the electrode via solvent exposed hemes may be 1183 involved. Also, no cytochromes for long-range electron transport were detected in the analysis 1184 (Table S6 and 7), suggesting that EET to electrodes by anammox bacteria rely on a direct EET 1185 mechanism. Homology detection and structure prediction by hidden Markov model comparison 1186 (HMM-HMM) of the highly upregulated penta-heme cytochrome EX330_07910 (Fig. S10 , Table   1187 S6) gave high probability hits to proteins associated to the extracellular matrix and outer membrane 1188 iron respiratory proteins such as MtrF, OmcA and MtrC. Also, it is worth mentioning that the gene 1189 cluster EX330_07910-07915 was one of the most upregulated under set-potential conditions. 1190 Therefore, future work should focus on determining the role of EX330_07910-07915 in the EET-1191 dependent anammox process. Likewise, we also found the expression of outer membrane mono-1192 heme c-type cytochromes (OM Cyt c (1 heme) (Fig. S10, Table S7 ) homologs to G. ",
