In this opinion piece, we describe the strategy for managing this problem at the Huanhu Hospital in Tianjin, China. We would like to note that after taking precautions in Tianjin based on our experience during the SARS outbreak, there is only 1 reported case of hospital staff infection (ICU doctor, mild case) locally. Among the fully equipped healthcare workers who were recruited to support Wuhan province (6200 nationally, 628 from Tianjin) since February 2020, there is no infection reported.",

Our hospital is the municipal referral center for cerebrovascular disease, performing approximately 1000 emergency procedures for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) yearly and using interventional techniques to treat hundreds of patients with ischemic stroke. Most of our stroke patients are an elderly, vulnerable population who are already experiencing respiratory compromise, with the risk of respiratory failure potentially increased due to COVID-19 infection. In this context we have adopted the following strategies, which have proven to be effective during the pandemic.",

Because patients with SAH and other cerebrovascular diseases can present with fever and pulmonary infection, it is unrealistic to rapidly differentiate from COVID-19 co-infection based on symptoms alone. As community spread of COVID-19 has reached endemic proportions, we now regard all emergency cases as suspected COVID-19-positive cases until proven negative by testing. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was upgraded to an appropriate level for all personnel in the ER to include N95 masks, full gown, goggles, and face shield. Our observation has been that endotracheal intubation poses the highest risk for secondary transmission to healthcare workers and we recommend performing nasotracheal intubation whenever possible. Any emergency intubation must be done wearing 2 layers of face protection (goggles and face shield), and ideally under positive ventilation conditions.",

To meet the isolation requirements, our tertiary referral hospital assigned a separate imaging area serving the ER, with MRI (3T magnet), CT (CTA), and DSA for suspected cases. We also assigned an OR and catheter lab to serve this contamination zone with easy access to the imaging area. Suspected cases are moved to the OR directly from the ER, receiving proper ventilation while in the contamination zone to meet our current protocols for preventing nosocomial infection. Because airborne infection poses the highest risk of large-scale infection among healthcare workers, we have developed a separate ventilation system for the contamination zone.",

This happened to the healthcare providers at Wuhan, Hubei Province, in January 2020, due to limited knowledge and protection. As of March 30, there have been 2974 confirmed cases and more than 60 deaths among the local healthcare team in Hubei. The cases are centralized in major hospitals, and most of them are not from infectious or respiratory disease services. 1 However, the situation improved dramatically after taking strict precautions-there is no infection reported among fully equipped healthcare workers who were recruited to support Wuhan province (6200 nationally, 628 from Tianjin) since February 2020. The standard precautions for the general public are absolutely inadequate for health workers. Don't reinvent the wheel. Please maximize protection in all ways-this is the firsthand experience from China to preserve healthcare resources for the battle against this epidemic.",
