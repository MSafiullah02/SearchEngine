This is especially true 7 for dermatology patients who often require ongoing care and use long-term immunomodulatory 8 medications. 9 Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and some major 10 private payers including UnitedHealthCare, Cigna, and Aetna have expanded telehealth coverage 11 during this pandemic. Additionally, CMS has issued a 1135 waiver providing compensation for 12 office, hospital, and other visits delivered via telehealth, including in patients' own homes. 13 Potential penalties for HIPAA violations when serving patients in good faith via FaceTime, 14 Skype, and other commonplace communication modalities also will be waived during this 15 emergency. 16 Since its inception, teledermatology has aided in triaging, diagnosing, and managing 17 many dermatologic conditions, ranging from inflammatory to neoplastic. 1 While the current 18 social distancing guidelines impede in-person assessments, dermatologists can utilize 19 teledermatology for routine follow-up and triage of urgent concerns, subsequently setting up in-20 person appointments, if needed. In addition, teledermatology can reach patients of various 21 socioeconomic levels who would otherwise not seek a dermatologist during this crisis. 2 Finally, 22 the American Academy of Dermatology has released guidance facilitating teledermatology 23 implementation. 3",
