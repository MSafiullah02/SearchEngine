An attractive solution is registry-based randomized clinical trials. 6 By including randomization in a clinical registry with unselected consecutive enrolment, the advantages of a prospective randomized trial can be aligned with the strengths of a large-scale, all-comers clinical registry. 7 Prospective registry-based randomized trials may be a powerful tool for conducting studies efficiently and cost-effectively, particularly in an urgent situation like the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Patients with COVID-19 and comorbidities have a worse prognosis than those with no underlying medical issues. However, other well-known cardiovascular risk factors commonly identified in these patients could also explain the higher risk of this population. 8, 9 Renin-angiotensin system blockers are commonly used in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities since this group of drugs is routinely indicated for patients with heart failure, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Angiotensin-converting J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f enzyme-2 (ACE2) may increase due to upregulation in patients using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Since SARS-CoV-2 (and other human pathogenic coronaviruses) binds to target cells through ACE2, 10 the worse prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease could be related to the interaction with drugs commonly used in these patients that may facilitate virus aggression. 11 On the basis of data indicating that ACE2 is an effective receptor for SARS-CoV-2, healthcare professionals and researchers are assessing the possible impact of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with COVID-19. 12 The ACE2 receptor is found on the surface of type II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs as well as cells in the heart, kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. There is uncertainty surrounding reninangiotensin system inhibition in patients with COVID-19, with some hypothesizing that ACEI/ARB use may increase propagation of the virus and others hypothesizing that there may be a protective effect ( Figure 1 ). 13 SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the cell by binding to ACE2. The use of an ACEI or ARB could enhance ACE2 abundance and consequently increase susceptibility to viral entry. In theory, this effect could increase the risk for or severity of COVID-19. On the other hand, an increase in the expression of angiotensin II drives lung injury by activating the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R), producing inflammation and fibrosis. Decreasing the production of angiotensin II with an ACEI or blocking angiotensin II-AT1R activity with an ARB enhances the production of angiotensin (1-7) from angiotensin II and activates the Mas receptor, which attenuates inflammation and fibrosis resulting in a decrease in lung damage. 14 Indeed, the use of recombinant human ACE2 has been tested as a promising therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. 15 Finally, renin-angiotensin system inhibition protects the cardiovascular system by lowering blood pressure, avoiding ventricular remodeling, and reducing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. 16 Thus, withdrawal of these agents could be harmful since there is a potential risk of disease complications related to discontinuation of established therapies already proven effective in preventing cardiovascular events. As a result, there are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 data supporting a potential benefit and also data indicating potential risk in maintaining these agents during COVID-19 infection, which reinforces the need of a prospective randomized study to address this clinical question.",

            "text": "The majority of patients affected by COVID-19 will have favorable clinical outcomes during the acute phase of the infection. 24 Nevertheless, the risk of severe forms of the infection increases significantly according to age and the presence of chronic comorbidities. 25, 26 Among these comorbidities, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cardiovascular diseases are particularly important because of the intrinsic risk of adverse outcomes and the prevalence of these conditions in the global population. 25, 26 Hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and coronary heart disease are common comorbidities associated with worse prognosis among patients with COVID-19; however, the higher risk detected in this group could also be due to other related factors that may facilitate infection and increase propagation of the virus. 27 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are routinely used for common cardiovascular conditions. [19] [20] [21] The benefits in reducing cardiovascular events are well established, mainly in long-term analyses of patients with chronic use of these therapies. 28, 29 However, in some acute clinical conditions, these drugs are temporarily discontinued due to an imminent risk higher than the potential short-term benefit of these therapies. 30 There is currently an intense debate about the suspension or maintenance of chronic ACEI/ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19. 12, 13, 27, 31, 32 The BRACE CORONA trial was designed to test the impact of discontinuation compared with maintenance of chronic ACEI/ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19. This is one of several questions facing physicians in the setting of COVID-19 and data are needed from randomized clinical trials like BRACE CORONA. Because renin-angiotensin system inhibitors increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19. 15 The presence of ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells makes the lungs a preferred site of entry for the virus, which explains the respiratory manifestations in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis of worse outcomes associated with the use of ACEI or ARB in patients with COVID-19 was recently shown in observational studies. 25, 26 However, a cause-effect relation between the use of ACEI or ARB and adverse events in COVID-19 cannot be established since many confounding factors could explain a worse or better prognosis for these patients in observational analyses. In a recent retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, all-cause mortality was lower among patients on ACEI/ARB therapy when compared with those not using ACEI/ARBs. 33 An observational analysis from a single-center study showed that ACEI/ARB use was not associated with severity of COVID-19 infection or worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with hypertension. 34 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 Nonetheless, the effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on ACE2 is uncertain and the potential harm related to this mechanism is not well defined. 31, 32 In addition, the use of ACEI or ARBs could be beneficial not only due to the well-known cardiovascular protection, 32 but also because of the potential respiratory system protection in patients affected by severe respiratory disease. 15, 27 Considering that these high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 are commonly hospitalized, the decision regarding the best approach for the management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is critical. In a scenario of apparent equipoise without high quality scientific evidence, the medical decisions in clinical practice have been heterogeneous. Thus, a randomized clinical trial is necessary to guide practice.",

However, the critical and urgent nature of a pandemic encourages opportunities to create more efficient research processes, which can be adopted for use in clinical research conducted during non-pandemic times. In a new and threatening situation like the COVID-19 pandemic there is no specific evidence to guide medical therapy, yet there is an urgent need to quickly answer the clinical questions that arise in order to guide treatment of the hundreds of thousands of people infected with a potentially lethal disease. Collaborative pragmatic studies are one of the best solutions in this scenario. 5 BRACE CORONA took less than 3 weeks from protocol development to first patient randomized, including national ethics board review and approval, which is unprecedented in Brazil ( Figure 4 ). The COVID-19 registry is already collecting the key clinical variables and outcomes that will be used for the randomized trial. Adding randomization to this structure allows for an efficient process, which can provide the scientific community with a streamlined approach to answer a relevant clinical question with less bureaucracy and at lower cost. In addition, clinicians on the frontline, who are already very interested in answering this medical question, will be highly engaged with the trial.",
