They can infect all kinds of organisms in a range from the bacteria to animals, including humans. Humans are constantly exposed to a vast diversity of viruses, and over two\u2010thirds of human pathogens belong to viruses (Woolhouse & Gaunt, 2007). The viruses have caused colossal mortality and morbidity to the human society in history, such as the devastating smallpox and Spanish flu outbreaks (Johnson & Mueller, 2002; Riedel, 2005). Despite the continuous progress in the prevention and control of viral disease, recent serial outbreaks caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (Breban, Riou, & Fontanet, 2013), avian influenza H7N9 viruses (Gao et al., 2013), Ebola viruses (Maganga et al., 2014) and Zika viruses (Mlakar et al., 2016) indicate that viruses still pose a severe threat to global public health.",

Generally, a new pathogen would not be identified until it caused epidemics or pandemics. Many viruses that may have been introduced into human populations remain undiscovered (Rosenberg, 2015). Traditional diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction, immunological assays and pan\u2010viral microarrays are inadequate for the quick identification of novel human\u2010infecting viruses (Corman et al., 2012; Wootton et al., 2011). The rapid development of viral metagenomic sequencing in recent years provides powerful high\u2010throughput and culture\u2010independent methods to identify new viruses, which lead to the accumulation of new viruses at an unprecedented pace (Alavandi & Poornima, 2012). The Global Virome Project (GVP), which was proposed and initiated at the beginning of 2018, estimated that there are over 1.67 million yet\u2010to\u2010be\u2010discovered viruses in animal reservoirs, while 631,000\u2013827,000 of these unknown viruses can infect humans (Carroll et al., 2018). Therefore, the development of rapid methods for identifying the potential human\u2010infecting viruses is in great need.",

For example, the methods based on k\u2010mers extracted from viral genomes (Ahlgren, Ren, Lu, Fuhrman, & Sun, 2016; Li & Sun, 2018) or sequence blast have been developed to predict the hosts of the phage (Bolotin, Quinquis, Sorokin, & Ehrlich, 2005; Edwards, McNair, Faust, Raes, & Dutilh, 2015). Some studies also attempted to identify the human virus by using these methods. Xu, Tan, Li, Jiang, and Peng (2017) developed SVM models to predict the hosts of influenza viruses based on word vectors. However, all of these studies focused on one or a few specific types of viruses, such as the coronavirus and influenza virus. These methods are not suitable for the identification of novel human\u2010infecting viruses from the viral metagenomic sequences. Herein, we employed machine learning models to establish a generic protocol for the rapid identification of potential human\u2010infecting viruses.",

Some of them are human\u2010specific that have been circulating in human populations for a long time, such as the human papillomavirus (Baseman & Koutsky, 2005) and yellow fever virus (Akondy et al., 2009); while some are zoonotic viruses that infect humans rarely, such as the avian influenza virus and coronavirus (Garc\u00eda\u2010Sastre & Schmolke, 2014; Shipley et al., 2019). As shown in numerous studies, the zoonotic viruses are very likely to cause epidemics or even pandemics after adaptive evolution. The most recent example is Zika viruses. It rarely caused wide\u2010spread epidemics in humans in the 20th century, even in highly enzootic areas, (Weaver et al., 2016). However, a few mutations in the viral genome facilitated its rapid spread in human populations (Campos, Bandeira, & Sardi, 2015; Duffy et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2017). The virus has caused epidemics in 84 countries and has infected more than one million people since 2014 (European CDC, 2016; de Oliveira Garcia, 2019). Taken together, it is difficult to distinguish the viruses with the varying ability of infecting humans. Therefore, the viruses with the various ability of infecting humans were considered equally in the modelling.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the human\u2010infecting viruses used here is far from complete when compared to those estimated by the GVP. However, the viruses used in this study covered 30 families in all groups of the Baltimore classification, which were similar to those estimated by the GVP (Carroll et al., 2018). Besides, the machine learning models had excellent performances in discriminating the human\u2010infecting viruses from other viruses. They could help much in discovering novel human\u2010infecting viruses. Secondly, the number of human\u2010infecting viruses was much less than that of other viruses. Such a large imbalance may hinder accurate modelling. Here, the under\u2010sampling method was used to deal with the imbalance problem so that the KNN model achieved excellent overall performances and high sensitivity in identifying the human\u2010infecting viruses. Thirdly, the model was not robust to the contamination of human sequences in the viral genomes. It would be better to remove such contamination from the viral sequences before using the model.",
