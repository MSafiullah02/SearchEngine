            "text": "Entry of virus into host cells is accomplished through virus attachment and fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Virus replication is mainly cytoplasmic, and maturation is by budding of assembled nucleocapsides through a virally modified cell membrane. One of the most characteristic effects of infection by CDV and related viruses is the induction of syncytium formation by cell fusion. This phenomenon has been observed both in vitro and in vivo [34, 43, 83, 721. CDV produces a natural disease in the dog characterized by an incubation period of three to six days, fever, nasal discharge, and both intestinal and respiratory involvement. Commonly, central nervous system (CNS) symptoms ensue either during the acute phase of the disease or late, after three or four weeks of illness. In some cases CNS infection may appear without previous signs of disease or after a period of recovery from systemic manifestations [6] . Initial studies at the ultrastructural level were performed in animals with clinical symptoms extending from ten days to twelve weeks prior to death. In all dogs, both demyelinating and destructive lesions were observed [78] . Demyelination occurred in areas with variable degrees of inflammation, was often observed around blood vessels (Fig l) , and was generally associated with cells. Processes of mononuclear cells were seen to encompass myelinated fibers and proceed either to phagocytose myelin from the outer toward the inner lamellae or to penetrate the myelin sheaths and strip myelin lamellae from their respective axons. Quiescent lesions were characterized by groups of denuded axons surrounded by activated glial processes in the absence of residual inflamma- alterations, the association of demyelination with inflammatory cells also suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process of myelin injury. In an attempt to resolve this question, studies were recently done to determine the sequence of events leading to demyelination in the early phase of the acute form of natural distemper [83] . Abundant evidence of early myelin breakdown was found in the absence of inflammatory cells except for occasional macrophages. In well-established lesions, on the other hand, inflammatory cells were numerous. Important cellular components of the acute lesions were multinucleated giant cells which, under electron microscopy, appeared to have been derived from fusion of astrocytes. Viral inclusions were numerous in both giant cells and astrocytes as well as in cells considered to be oligodendrocytes (Fig 2) . A major conclusion from these studies was that demyelination in CDV infection was not necessarily related to the presence of an inflammatory response and that inflammatory 13-28, 1976.) cells probably represented a secondary late response to viral-induced tissue injury [83] .",

To this point, however, the dog remains the only animal to develop demyelination after experimental infection with CDV. Initially, even in the natural host, CDV produced demyelination in only a small percentage of dogs. The isolation of R252 CDV by cocultivation with Vero cells and its subsequent inoculation into dogs expanded the incidence of demyelination to almost 50% of infected animals [62, 631.

In these animals, multiple areas of demyelination were observed in the medulla and cerebellum. Inflammatory cells were absent in such demyelinating lesions. Reactive astrocytes were numerous, and many astrocytic nuclei contained eosinophilic viral inclusions, as did some oligodendroglial nuclei. Immunologically, dogs with the acute syndrome were affected by severe, persistent lymphopenia. Subacute encephalitis presenting with intermittent neurological dysfunction occurred in other animals. Affected animals survived for at least twelve weeks after infection. Pathologically, there were multifocal demyelinating lesions in association with perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells. Inflammatory cells were also found in nondemyelinated areas of white matter, however, and some demyelinated areas were free of inflammatory cells. Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear accumulations of CDV nucleocapsids were present in several types of cells, especially astrocytes. Immunologically, these animals developed transient lymphopenia.

Thus, newborn dogs most often displayed the acute encepha-litic form of CDV infection, while the subacute form was more common when dogs were infected as weanlings [45] . Such data imply a delicate balance between CDV infection and mechanisms of host immunity. Altering the balance profoundly affects the outcome of the disease. Thus, when viral factors predominate, acute fatal encephalitis ensues; if host defenses predominate, persistent infection develops [45] . Support for this hypothesis can be found in experimental studies in which anti-CDV antibody passively transferred to newborn gnotobioric (germ-free) dogs resulted in prolongation of the disease course and, more importantly, in modification of the pathological lesions in the CNS [47] . Extensive involvement of gray matter, multiple viral inclusions in large neurons, and sporadic demyelination in dogs receiving anti-CDV antibody contrasted sharply with only sporadic foci of neuronal degeneration in untreated animals. Although the mechanisms of antibody-induced modification of CDV encephalitis are not well understood, these studies suggested that both clinical expression of the disease and severity of pathological lesions are at least partly dependent upon immunological factors [471.",

From the cited studies of both natural and experimental CDV encephalitis, several conclusions emerge. Two lines of evidence favor the hypothesis that demyelination is immune mediated: (1) mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates can be found in lesions of both the subacute and chronic forms of CDV infection, i.e., \"old dog encephalitis\" [62, 981; and ( 2 ) antimyelin antibodies have been shown to develop prior to the onset of encephalitis [44] . On the other hand, data against immune-mediated injury include the following: (1) the acute form of demyelination is not associated with inflammatory cells [83] ; ( 2 ) in the subacute form, many of the demyelinating lesions can be anatomically separated from mononuclear infiltrates, and vice versa [62, 83] [83] . In this regard, fusion of glial cells by virus, similar to the situation in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, has been invoked as one possible mechanism leading to myelin disruption [83] . [60] . This makes further investigation of the model cumbersome and expensive. Furthermore, CDV is highly contagious, so studies must be conducted under strict conditions of isolation. Finally, immunological manipulations in dogs are not standardized and cannot be conducted under controlled genetic conditions such as exist for inbred strains of mice.",

JHMV replication in oligodendroglia, as in other types of cells, is characterized by virus budding into cytoplasmic vacuoles and cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum [30, 521. Infected oligodendrocytes quickly undergo pathological alterations characterized by hyperproduction of haphazardly oriented membranes, abnormal multiple connections with myelin sheaths (Fig 3) [77], and formation of syncytia by fusion with other oligodendroglial cells [30] . The presence of morphological alterations in oligodendrocytes, the lack of a temporal and anatomical relationship between demyelination and inflammation, as well as the failure of immunosuppression to prevent demyelination [97] strongly suggest that myelin degeneration in this model is due to primary viral injury of the myelin-supporting cell rather than to immune-mediated mechanisms.",

Complement-fixing antibodies are detected in serum two to three weeks after infection, while virus neutralizing antibodies appear by six weeks to three months. Antibody titers then persist at a fairly constant level for years. High titers of neutralizing antibodies are also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The lack of correlation between serum and CSF antibody titers suggests that viral antibodies are synthesized locally in the CNS. In support of this conclusion, typical plasma cells are generally present in both CSF and CNS tissues, and oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands have been observed in some CSF specimens. There is evidence that the immune response is important in limiting the spread of virus, thus contributing to the slowness of the infection [61] .",

Isolates from the CNS of paralyzed mice and from stools of asymptomatic mice were able to reproduce experimentally the same CNS paralytic disease as Theiler's original strains, and they are referred to as TO strains of TMEV.

Pathologically, the first phase of spinal cord gray matter involvement is characterized by areas of focal necrosis, neuronophagia, and mononuclear cell infiltration. These changes are readily observed from the first to the fourth week after infection but decline progressively during the second month. Gray matter changes are rarely seen after six to seven weeks of infection [55] . The first phase of the infection is therefore an acute poliomyelitic disease that appears to be self limiting. The arrest in progression of gray matter lesions correlates temporally with the maximum rise in neutralizing antibody [ These changes are practically identical to those of EAE, the prototype for autoimmune diseases of the CNS [5 11 . In contrast to JHMV infection, oligodendroglial cells are often observed to be intact in areas rich in demyelinated axons, indicating that oligodendroglial infection is not the primary cause of myelin degeneration (Fig 6) [2 11. Ultrastructural immu-nohistochemica1 studies have also indicated that oligodendrocytes in and around demyelinating lesions appear to be free of viral antigen [23] . Although a low-level infection of these cells cannot be excluded, it appears that myelin degeneration in this disease is not primarily cytolytic. Immunosuppression studies strongly support this contention. When infected mice are treated with cyclophosphamide, white matter disease is greatly decreased or completely prevented, while gray matter disease is enhanced [56] . This The mechanisms underlying host-mediated virusinduced demyelination in this model are still under investigation. The immune response to TMEV infection is rather peculiar. Although serum neutralizing antibody is present by one week, there is an unusually slow rise in antibody titer, which reaches its peak at around two months after infection and remains at that level for the entire period of the disease [57] . Similarly, the cellular immune response, as measured by in vitro incorporation of [\"]-labeled thymidine into DNA of spleen cells in the presence of ultraviolet-inactivated TMEV antigen, is not detectable until two months after infection. Once established, however, it gradually rises and is present for the entire duration of the disease [81] . The delay in immune responses may be due in part to limited exposure of the immune system to the virus, which replicates only in the CNS. Under these conditions, stimulation of the immune system may be totally dependent on chronic leakage of virus across the blood-brain barrier. Macrophages, which by ultrastructural immunohistochemistry have been observed to contain large amounts of viral antigen in diseased white matter for months after infection, may be instrumental in carrying the virus across the barrier [23] .",

Relapses are characterized by new waves of inflammatory demyelination in previously normal white matter or by renewed demyelination of areas that had previously been remyelinated, mostly by invading Schwann cells (Figs 7,  8 ) [22] . Remyelination of CNS axons by Schwann cells is very prominent in this model. Normal function is probably restored in axons remyelinated by Schwann cells since mice appear completely normal during the remyelinating phase. MS patients have also been shown to have Schwann cell-remyelinated axons in chronic lesions [35] . It is intriguing to speculate that stimulation of Schwann cell activity in demyelinated CNS lesions might result in amelioration of neurological function in MS patients as well. Ultrastructural immunohistochemical studies have shown that Schwann cells in areas undergoing a second wave of demyelination involving Schwann cellremyelinated axons are free of viral antigen, while other cells, including macrophages, contain abundant immune reaction product [20] . These results add support to the contention that demyelination in this model is not due to a primary viral attack on the myelinating cells, but rather is dependent on the host immune response.",

Heterozygous mice demonstrated pathological alterations indistinguishable from those in Balb/c infected mice. Prominent inflammation and demyelination occurred. Homozygous nude mice, on the other hand, showed no evidence of myelin degeneration and little inflammation [25] . Gray matter disease, however, was enhanced in nude mice, and extensive necrosis occurred. Immunofluorescence studies performed in both heterozygous and nude mice demonstrated viral antigen in white and gray matter of both groups. In fact, in nude mice the amount of viral antigen detected as well as virus titers were greater than in heterozygous littermates, whereas demyelination was found only in heterozygous mice [25] .

In a recent study, demyelinating lesions were usually seen to be associated with mononuclear infiltrates rich in lymphocytes. A close anatomical association between lymphocytic processes and astrocytes or macrophages was interpreted as supporting evidence for immune-mediated myelin injury [42] . Experiments in nude mice also support this contention, as SFVinduced demyelination was reported to be less severe in these animals than in normal mice [40] .",

At least two different mechanisms may be involved in the production of demyelination in viral infections. First, a direct viral cytopathic effect on oligodendrocytes can occur. JHMV encephalomyelitis of mice is the prototypic example of such a mechanism. A second mechanism, involving host immune reactivity to virus or CNS antigens, appears to play a major role in other models. Theiler virus encephalomyelitis may be the best example of such immune-mediated injury. In most infections, both mechanisms probably operate but their relative role varies. Since participation of the host immune system appears to play an important role in MS, models based on combined virus-immune pathogenesis may be especially relevant to human d' isease.",

First, viral antigenic material could be inserted into the plasma membranes of oligodendrocytes, which in turn could be damaged by the ensuing host antiviral immune attack. This is not likely to happen in Theiler virus infection, as picornaviruses do not bud from cells. Second, virus and myelin could share some antigenic determinants. Although cross reactivity has been demonstrated between measles virus and myelin basic protein [71] , this is unlikely to be the case with several different and unrelated viruses. Third, virus could cause primary myelin injury that would lead to release of free myelin antigenic material. The resulting series of events would be quite similar to EAE. Although this appears to be an attractive possibility, data exist which are not supportive. For example, experiments measuring cellmediated immune responses to myelin basic protein in Theiler virus infection have given inconclusive results (unpublished data), in contrast to studies of EAE [73, 741. Finally, in addition to the foregoing classic theories, considerable attention has been devoted in the last few years to the possibility that myelin may be damaged as an innocent bystander in the midst of an immune reaction against unrelated antigens. This concept originates from work done in 1968 by Ruddle and Waksman [85] , who demonstrated nonspecific bystander killing of rat embryo fibroblasts in the presence of heterologous antigen and sensitized lymphoid cells. More recently, Wisniewski and Bloom [loo] extended this concept to the CNS in vivo. They demonstrated primary demyelination following local injection of purified protein derivative in the spinal cord of guinea pigs previously sensitized to that antigen. It has been proposed that a similar mechanism may operate in viral infections, in which virus would act as the target antigen and myelin would be nonspecifically damaged by a surrounding antiviral immunological attack [ 2 1, 56, 791.",

The immunological and viral hypotheses for the pathogenesis of MS are not mutually exclusive since a viral infection could trigger host immune mechanisms, which in torn would mediate tissue injury. The possibility that important human demyelinating diseases may be triggered by viral infection has stimulated numerous laboratories to develop animal models of virus-induced demyelination during the past several years [50, 611. New observations by several laboratories indicate that a variety of conventional viruses produce primary demyelination, probably based on immunopathological mechanisms. This paper reviews those findings and analyzes their relevance to human demyelinating disease. Canine Distemper Virus Infection Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirzls of the family Paramixoviridae [ 3 ] . It is antigenically related to bovine rinderpest and human measles viruses. All three viruses contain hemagglutinin but no neuraminidase in the virion envelope. Virions are composed of a relatively rigid helical nucleocapsid, 15 to 19 nm in diameter, enclosed in a lipid-containing envelope studded with projections. The overall diameter of the virion is 120 to 300 nm. The viral genome is a continuous molecule of single-stranded RNA with a molecular weight of 6 x 106 daltons. It is transcribed by a virion-associated polymerase into complementary messenger R N A , also present in the virion. Infected cells contain several size classes of virus RNA, some of which correspond to replicative and transcriptive intermediates [31 Distemper, measles, and rinderpest viruses have similar protein compositions. Seven polypeptides have been characterized in CDV [l",
