            "text": "SARS is an infectious disease with a high mortality rate caused by the human coronavirus SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003). The severity and global spread of the 2003 SARS outbreak has led to the search for specific antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV. Results from both in vitro studies and case reports from the clinic have been published, but no consensus treatment has yet been established. Major efforts are being made to understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV replication in order to identify drug targets of specific antiviral compounds (Chu et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004, Thiel et al., 2003, Vastag, 2003, Wu et al., 2004). Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that initiate infection of susceptible cells by binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on the host cell membrane via the viral S protein (Li et al., 2003, Xu et al., 2004). Following receptor binding and membrane fusion, the infectious genomic RNA is delivered into the cytoplasm and viral gene expression is initiated resulting in the translation of two replicase/transcriptase polyproteins. These two enzymes are responsible for the replication of the viral genome as well as the generation of a multiple subgenomic mRNAs including those encoding the structural proteins S (spike), M (membrane), E (envelope) and N (nucleocapsid) (De Haan et al., 2002). A complex set of regulatory mechanisms controls the viral gene expression, and additional virus-encoded enzymes, such as helicase and proteases, are crucial for the production of infectious virus particles (Thiel et al., 2003). Progeny virions are assembled in the endoplasmatic reticulum-golgi apparatus and released from infected cells by exocytosis. The viral entry and assembly processes as well as the enzymatic steps involved in viral replication constitute potential targets for antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "Understanding the mechanism of viral replication is not the only key step towards identification of effective drugs against a virus. Development of rapid screening assays is also essential for antiviral drug discovery. The present standard infectivity assay for SARS-CoV is based on viral infection of VeroE6 cells followed by visual monitoring of cytopathic effects (CPE; Ksiazek et al., 2003). The low-throughput nature of this assay format limits its use for efficient screening of large chemical libraries. This study describes the development of a stable cell line susceptible to SARS-CoV that constitutively expresses EGFP, which can be used for the automated screening of inhibitors of virus activity. A high degree of correlation between virus replication and reduced EGFP signal is expected for highly cytopathic viruses such as SARS-CoV where the background EGFP signal is rapidly reduced by extensive cell death. The specificity and selectivity of compounds active in this SARS-CoV screening assay were determined by parallel screening for cytotoxicity and inhibition of a porcine coronavirus using similar assay formats. This set of assays was used in the screening of a test panel of 3388 randomly chosen chemical compounds to demonstrate its application to drug discovery.",

The cells were subjected to FACS analysis of EGFP expression to select those clones exhibiting a profile of high mean fluorescence intensity and homogeneous signal (Fig. 1\n). The EGFP expressing clones were further evaluated for susceptibility to virus infection, showing all clones were susceptible to either SARS-CoV or TGEV as measured by CPE induction after virus challenge (data not shown). The growth characteristics of the VeroE6-EGFP and LLC-PK1-EGFP clones were similar to the parental VeroE6 and LLC-PK1 cell lines (data not shown), indicating that the EGFP expression did not affect cell proliferation. As expected, the transduced cells showed an exponential growth that was dependent on the initial cell density (a representative example is shown in Fig. 2\n). Moreover, the growth experiments showed that a final seeding density of 25,000 cells/ml was suitable for keeping the cells in the exponential growth phase throughout a 5-day assay period. Taking all selection criteria into account, clone 21 of VeroE6-EGFP and clone 45 of LLC-PK1-EGFP (data not shown) were selected as indicator cells to be seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/ml in the screening assays.",

Susceptible cell lines were equipped with EGFP reporter genes and used for quantification of cytotoxicity, SARS-CoV and TGEV activity. This assay system can be readily applied to high-throughput screening and has many advantages over assays based on laborious and subjective scoring of CPE or plaque formation. The assay system described in this study requires minimal manipulation after assay set-up, and no staining, washing, fixation or manual inspection of the tissue culture plates which is especially advantageous when working with hazardous viruses such as SARS-CoV.",

Thus, the platform of three parallel screening assays described here obtains more data from the potentially useful compounds at the initial screening step than simple infectivity assays, and therefore speeds up downstream drug development. It is, of course, conceivable that potent antiviral drug candidates can be developed from compounds targeting multiple coronaviruses: compounds active against other coronaviruses may be selected from the data obtained in this screening system and analyzed separately.",

The variation in results obtained in this study from novaron, glycirrihizin and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine as compared to previously published results may be due to assay conditions including virus strain, multiplicity of infection, detection method and compound concentration and handling (Cinatl et al., 2003, Keyaerts et al., 2004). Notably, other independent groups have also observed lack of anti-SARS-CoV activity of glycyrrhizin (Hertzig et al., 2004, Yi et al., 2004). The assay system was also evaluated in the setting of a chemical library screen. Compounds that were selectively active against SARS-CoV at non-cytotoxic compound concentrations were identified in the library screen.
