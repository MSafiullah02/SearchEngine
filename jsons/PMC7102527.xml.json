The third death was a 82-year-old male who was a Beijing resident with pulmonary infection and multiple chronic diseases, was defined as a confirmed case in Feb 2, transferred to the designated hospital in Feb 3, died in Feb 10, 2020. The fatality of COVID-19 infection was significantly lower in Beijing compared with the whole national (0.9% vs 2.4%, P < 0.001), while the rate of discharged in Beijing was significantly higher than the whole national (14% vs 9.4%, P < 0.001). Beijing was the fourth most affected city or province in China for accumulative confirmed cases of the COVID-19 infection at the end of Jan 23, reduced to the 8th in Jan 25, to the 10th in Jan 27, and out of the top ten later.(Fig. 3\n) By contrast, in May 4, 2003, 4280 confirmed SARS cases had been reported, 206 of whom died (4.8%) distributing in 24 provinces in Chinese mainland. The fatality of the COVID-19 infection has no significant with SARS by the same period (x2=0.592,P=0.442). From May 1st, the new confirmed case of SARS started to decline, but the COVID-19 confirmed cases was still moving in the mainland of China until Feb 10, 2020. (Fig. 4\n)",

Drazen said, the SARS shows that when confronted by a common enemy, we can forget our differences and work together fruitfully. This was the most important lesson from SARS, let us hope that we can all benefit from it.12 Recently, the COVID-19 infection occurred and spread in the mainland of China, but the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus severe and fatal cases for COVID-19 infection is currently still unknown that hampers realistic assessment of the virus's epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response,5 furthermore, the recent publications on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics mainly came from Wuhan,6\n,\n7\n,\n13 the information about the imported city is exceedingly rare. On the basis of this study, firstly we provided the proportion of severe versus common cases of the COVID-19 infection, which was approximately 1:4, the ratio of severe to mild, non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases were 18%, 73%, 4% and 5% respectively, the changes and prognosis of those four categories should be future observed in hospitals. 13 asymptomatic cases were the close contacts who were found by medical observation in this study. If not insulated for medical observation, they would not seek health care or visit hospital and cannot be found in the special period, and will spread to the other close contacts.15, 16 Therefore, to identify and control the non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases are the important measures to prevent transmission on the COVID-19.",

Second, the observation time of this study is only 22 days, which is a bit short, and indicators such as discharge rate and fatality need further observation.
