Ecosystem benefits include stabilization and sequestration of carbon, elimination of nitrogen and sulphur forms of harmful gaseous emissions, and restoration and enhancement of soil productivity. Furthermore, the new European directives indicate that the treatment should also consider biosecurity, health and environmental standards. These standards, applicable both to the treatment technology and the final by-product, are essential for maintaining and improving animal productivity (De la Torre et al., 2001).",

One of the main transformations in this treatment is the conversion of ammonia into nitrate through microbial nitrification. There are two advanced processes to raise the concentration of nitrifying bacteria in the reaction tanks; polymer-immobilised nitrifying bacteria (PINBT) (Vanotti et al., 2001) and membrane bioreactors (BRM) (Martinez-Almela and Luna, 2002). The immobilisation process provides a very appropriate environment in order for the microorganisms to reach optimum efficiency. Ammonia nitrogen elimination rates from 915 to 990 mg N/L-reactor/day have been obtained (after the solid\u2013liquid separation) and from 97% to 99% nitrification efficiency, without any inhibition in spite of the high rates of ammonia concentration (Vanotti et al., 2000). The membrane bioreactor is an advanced activated sludge system where membrane filtration replaces the clarifier. Thus, the system is operated with a very high concentration of microbial biomass in the reactors tanks resulting in an increased efficiency and treatment optimisation.",

In the purification of the separated liquid fraction two basic types of organic carbon can be used: either an endogenous source contained in the waste water itself or an external source, such as methanol, unseparated liquid manure, etc. In the first case, the process leads to a pre-denitrification process which recycles one part of the nitrified effluent in an anoxic tank, and in the second case to a post-denitrification arrangement (Vanotti and Hunt, 2001; Vanotti et al., 2001).",
