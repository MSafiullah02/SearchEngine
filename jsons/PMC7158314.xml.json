Since then, respiratory and general physicians have become accustomed to dealing with an extraordinary range of esoteric and previously unheard of conditions. Pneumocystis carinii (now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia is frequently part of the differential diagnosis of treatment-nonresponsive pneumonic illness. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is almost routinely offered as a \u201crule out\u201d test in clinical cases that defy simple diagnosis. In many parts of the developing world, advanced HIV disease is unfortunately the likeliest reason for seeking medical care. The change this has wrought on people, countries and their economies is huge and depressing.",

Before HAART, defined as a combination of medications that usually includes at least three potent anti-HIV agents, treatment largely consisted of specific opportunistic infection management and less effective antiretroviral therapy. The clinical consequences of this change are enormous. The relative hazard for development of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in an HIV-infected individual has fallen by more than 80%. Drug therapy does have a down side. It has significant unwanted effects, as well as major interactions with other medication (e.g., rifamycins used in treating tuberculosis). The profound change in immunity induced by HAART may also lead to disease (the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [IRIS]).",

Globally, 4.3 million individuals acquired HIV infection in 2006, and over this time 2.9 million died of AIDS. The developing world has been most affected. Sub-Saharan Africa is the current epicenter of the pandemic (two thirds of all infections); here, one in five adults is HIV infected.

In the developed world, North America and Western Europe account for approximately 1.4 million and 740,000 infections, respectively. Most of these are spread through sexual contact, although vertical (mother-to-child) and bloodborne infections are also common.

HIV gp120 must also bind to a cell surface protein coreceptor called chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or to other co-receptors, including CXCR4, depending on the host cell type.

This leads to progressive immune dysfunction and an inability to resist opportunistic disease. The pathogenic process is not well defined, although it is thought that at the time of primary infection, HIV spreads to the lymph nodes, circulating immune cells, and thymus. This is a massive viral infection of the human host; and although there seems to be a relatively potent immune response, in fact, this initial onslaught is so devastating (targeting as it does specific memory T cells responsible for sustaining long-term protective immunity) that the scene is set for progressive immune failure. This occurs through a combination of direct cell killing by HIV replicating within cells, as well as the negative effects of chronic immune activation. Ultimately, these lead in most individuals to immune system destruction and dysfunction. This is reflected not only by clinical disease indicating profound immunosuppression but also by a measurable reduction in the circulating absolute CD4 cell count, the percentage of T cells expressing CD4 markers, and in the progressive reduction in CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio.",

Over time, it has been modified to incorporate the expanding spectrum of recognized diseases affecting immunosuppressed individuals, such as cervical carcinoma and recurrent bacterial pneumonia (see Box 34-1). The 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification included an immunologic criterion for AIDS (CD4 count <200 cells/\u03bcL or CD4 percentage <14% of total lymphocytes) regardless of clinical symptoms (see Table 34-3). These data are used to define a point at which the risk of severe opportunistic infection rises dramatically. An example of this can be seen in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) of homosexual and bisexual men without AIDS, which found that the incidence of PCP in subjects who did not use prophylaxis rose from 0.5% at 6 months in men with a baseline CD4 count >200 cells/\u03bcL to 8.4% in those with a CD4 count <200 cells/\u03bcL.",

Until recently, these have been performed on symptomatic patients who required bronchoscopy as a diagnostic procedure.

Thus, the clinician is left with either proceeding to diagnostic lung fluid or tissue sampling (by either induced sputum collection or bronchoscopy and BAL with or without transbronchial biopsy Table 34-7\n) or treating an unknown condition empirically. HAART has also altered the investigation of respiratory disease. The numbers of invasive procedures performed are falling and tend to be in patients not taking antiretroviral drugs (usually to exclude PCP) or where there has been no response to empiric antibiotic therapy (regardless of the CD4 count).",

Although it is still the case that respiratory disease remains above non-HIV infected background levels, in particular, bacterial pneumonia, TB, and lung cancer are more common, despite apparently effective HAART, in HIV-infected subjects. Overall data indicate that clinical progression is rare in subjects who are able to adhere rigorously to at least 95% of their antiretroviral drug regimen. Mortality rates have fallen by 80% for almost all conditions, and it seems that a damaged immune system can, to a clinically significant extent, be reconstituted for a period of at least several years. Hence, clinicians need to consider not only opportunistic infection or malignancy within their diagnostic workup but also the effects of drug therapy itself. The side effect profile of HAART (e.g., metabolic and mitochondrial toxicities, liver damage, and neuropsychiatric disorders), as well as the large number of drug\u2013drug interactions, makes this a very complex area of management. The best example of this is HIV-related tuberculosis. Here, not only is there overlapping toxicity and pharmacologic interaction, but IRIS is common. Research is needed to address this area. Studies should inform the decision on when to start HAART in patients already on antituberculosis medication. Other work needs to focus on understanding why full pulmonary immunity is not restored.
