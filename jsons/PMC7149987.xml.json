The shocking images of the September 11, 2001, attacks remind us of just how dramatic and devastating terrorism can be. In most developed countries, the concept of bioterrorism and many of the words associated with it are widely recognized. In the United States, bioterrorism became a household word in October 2001, when Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax) spores were introduced into the US Postal Service system by several letters dropped into a mailbox in Trenton, New Jersey (see Fig. 1.1\n). These letters resulted in 5 deaths from pulmonary anthrax and 17 other cases of inhalation and cutaneous anthrax (Thompson, 2003). In the weeks and months that followed, first responders were called to the scene of thousands of \u201cwhite powder\u201d incidents that came as a result of numerous hoaxes, mysterious powdery substances, and just plain paranoia (Beecher, 2006). Public health laboratories all over the United States were inundated with samples collected from the scene of these incidents. Testing of postal facilities, US Senate office buildings, and news-gathering organizations\u2019 offices occurred. Between October and December 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratories successfully and accurately tested more than 125,000 samples, which amounted to more than 1 million separate bioanalytical tests (CDC, 2015). Henceforth there has been a national sense of urgency in preparedness and response activities for a potential act of bioterrorism.",

In his thought-provoking book Guns, Germs and Steel, Dr. Jared Diamond points out the epidemiological transitions we have faced since we were hunters and gatherers. More than 10,000 years ago the human experience with biological peril was mostly parasitic diseases that only affected individuals. After that, human societies began to herd and domesticate animals. The development of agriculture allowed for population growth and a shift from small tribal bands to a concentration of people into villages. Larger groups of people could stand up to smaller elements, thereby enabling them to successfully compete for resources and better defend the ground that they held. Agriculture also brought some deadly gifts: animal diseases that also affected man (zoonotic diseases), outbreaks of disease due to massing of people and lack of innate immunity, and a growing reliance on animal protein (Diamond, 1999).",

Advances in weapons of all types and explosives allowed military forces to defeat their enemies overtly on the battlefield and covertly behind the lines. Technologies leading to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons have also been exploited. Indeed, each has been used legitimately and illegitimately on different scales to bring about a change in the tactics, the military situation, or the political will to face an enemy in battle. Biological agents are no exception to this rule. As such, biowarfare (biological warfare) has a historical aspect to it that must be considered here because advances in the use of biological agents over the last century are one of the main reasons why bioterrorism exists today.",

Other agencies, most notably the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, have been more variable. These two agencies saw increased budget requests in FY2006, focusing on programs that protect the nation\u2019s food and water supplies.

These allegations might have been part of a propaganda campaign, or they may have been due to rumor. Regardless, some of the examples we have been given cannot be supported by microbiological or epidemiologic data. In addition, the incidence of naturally occurring endemic or epidemic diseases during that time complicates the picture so that attribution is impossible (Christopher et al., 1997). More important, our awareness that infectious diseases are caused by microbes does not go back very far in human history. Germ theory, or the fact that infectious diseases are related to and caused by microorganisms, emerged after 1860 through the independent works of Pasteur, Lister, and Koch (Tortora et al., 1995). Therefore how could the attacking or defending commander know that the festering corpses might cause disease when people at that time thought that epidemics were related to \u201cmiasmas,\u201d the smell of decomposition, or heavenly \u201cinfluences\u201d? One need only consider the origin of certain disease names to appreciate this confusion. For instance, malaria gets its name from malaria, or \u201cbad air\u201d (ie, swamp gases; Desowitz, 1991). It was not until 1880 that we learned that the etiologic agents of malaria are protozoans in the genus Plasmodium. The name influenza refers to the ancient belief that the disease was caused by a misalignment of the stars because of some unknown supernatural or cosmic influence (Latin influentia). It was not until 1933 that we learned the flu was caused by the influenza virus (Potter, 2001).\n",

Castle defenders reported that \u201cthe stink and the air were so abominable\u2026they could not long endure\u201d and negotiated a truce.\u2022In AD 1422 at Karlstein in Bohemia, attacking forces launched the decaying cadavers of men killed in battle over the castle walls. They also stockpiled animal manure in the hope of spreading illness. However, the defense held fast, and the siege was abandoned after 5 months. Russian troops may have used the same tactic using the corpses of plague victims against the Swedes in 1710.\u2022In AD 1495 the Spanish contaminated French wine with the blood of lepers.\u2022In the mid-1600s a Polish military general reportedly put saliva from rabid dogs into hollow artillery spheres for use against his enemies.\u2022Francisco Pizarro reportedly gave smallpox virus\u2013contaminated clothing to South American natives in the 15th century.\u2022In a letter dated July 16, 1763, General Jeffrey Amherst, a British officer, approved the plan to spread smallpox to Delaware Indians (Robertson, 2001). Amherst suggested the deliberate use of smallpox to \u201creduce\u201d Native American tribes hostile to the British (Parkman, 1901). An outbreak of smallpox at Fort Pitt resulted in the generation of smallpox-contaminated materials and an opportunity to carry out Amherst\u2019s plan. On June 24, 1763, one of Amherst\u2019s subordinates gave blankets and a handkerchief from the smallpox hospital to the Native Americans and recorded in his journal, \u201cI hope it will have the desired effect\u201d (Sipe, 1929).\u2022The same tactic was used during the Civil War by Dr. Luke Blackburn, the future governor of Kentucky. Dr. Blackburn infected clothing with smallpox and yellow fever virus, which he then sold to Union troops. One Union officer\u2019s obituary stated that he died of smallpox contracted from his infected clothing (Guillemin, 2006).\n",

Furthermore, medical professionals established that wars, famines, and poverty opened populations to the risk of epidemics. Once these links were established, we learned that we could apply control and intervention methods. Scientific knowledge about disease transmission coupled with social stability and active public health campaigns aided human survival. It subsequently became possible for advanced populations to protect their citizens from the burden of some of the most insidious infectious diseases, such as plague, cholera, diphtheria, smallpox, influenza, and malaria. These epidemics swept across nations in previous centuries, hitting hardest in crowded urban centers and affecting mostly the poor (Guillemin, 2006).",

The German military has the dubious honor of being the first example of using biological weapons following a state-sponsored program. However, during World War I, they used disease-causing organisms against animals, not people. The goal of their program was to interrupt the flow of supplies to the Allied frontlines. To do this they targeted the packhorses and mules shipped from Norway, Spain, Romania, and the United States. In 1915, Dr. Anton Dilger, a German-American physician, developed a microbiology facility in Washington, DC. Dilger produced large quantities of anthrax and glanders bacteria using seed cultures provided by the imperial German government. At the loading docks, German agents inoculated more than 3000 animals that were destined for the Allied Forces in Europe (Wheelis, 1999). From the German perspective, these attacks violated no international law. In addition, these activities were dwarfed by the atrocities of chemical warfare that was being waged on both sides of the line.",

Biological weapon experiments in Harbin, Manchuria, directed by Japanese General Shiro Ishii, continued until 1945. A post-World War II autopsy investigation of 1000 victims revealed that most were exposed to aerosolized anthrax. More than 3000 prisoners and Chinese nationals may have died in Unit 731 facilities. In 1939 the Japanese military poisoned Soviet water sources with intestinal typhoid bacteria at the former Mongolian border. During an infamous biowarfare attack in 1941, the Japanese military released millions of plague-infected fleas from airplanes over villages in China and Manchuria, resulting in several plague outbreaks in those villages. The Japanese program had stockpiled 400 kg of anthrax to be used in specially designed fragmentation bombs.",

Production of these agents occurred at Camp Detrick, Maryland, and other sites in Arkansas, Colorado, and Indiana. The British had made two primary requests of us: (1) to mass produce anthrax spores so that they could be placed in bomblets and stored for later deployment against the Germans in retaliation for any future strike and (2) the British supplied us with the recipe to make botulinum toxin and wanted to see if we could mass produce it.

Disguised as maintenance workers, they released noninfectious bacteria into the duct work of the building to assess the vulnerability of people inside large buildings to a bioweapons attack. The Pentagon trial was considered to be a success because it revealed that germs could be formulated and released effectively for a small-scale act of sabotage. However, there was considerable doubt that biological weapons could be effective against a target the size of a city. Accordingly, several tests were conducted on American cities (Miller et al., 2001). In 1977 the US Army admitted that there were 239 intentional releases of noninfectious bacteria in bioweapons experiments (Cole, 1988). One such trial took place in San Francisco in September 1950, when a US Navy ship sailed a course adjacent to the Golden Gate Bridge to release a plume of seemingly nonpathogenic bacteria (Serratia marcescens). This trial was intended to simulate the dispersion of anthrax spores on a large city. On the basis of results from monitoring equipment at 43 locations around the city, the Army determined that San Francisco had received enough of a dose for nearly all of the city\u2019s 800,000 residents to inhale at least 5000 of the particles. Although the researchers believed that what they were releasing was harmless, one report shows that 11 people reported to area hospitals with severe infections because of the release of this agent, 1 of which was fatal (Cole, 1988).",

It was the largest scale act of bioterrorism in US history. More than 750 cases of salmonellosis resulted from the salad bar contamination. It was later discovered that the Rajneeshees wanted to influence the local county elections. Cult members obtained the Salmonella strain through the mail from American Type Culture Collection and propagated the liquid cultures in their compound\u2019s medical clinic.\u2022In 1989 a home laboratory producing botulinum toxin was discovered in Paris. This laboratory was linked to a cell of the German-based B\u00e4der Meinhof Gang.\u2022In Minnesota, four members of the Patriots Council, an antigovernment extremist group, were arrested in 1991 for plotting to kill a US marshal with ricin. The group planned to mix the homemade ricin with a chemical that speeds absorption (dimethylsulfoxide) and then smear it on the door handles of the marshal\u2019s car. The plan was discovered and all four men were arrested and the first to be prosecuted under the US Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.\u2022In 1995 Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult, became infamous for an act of chemical terrorism when members released sarin gas into the Tokyo subway. What many people do not know about the group is that it developed and attempted to use biological agents (anthrax, Q fever, Ebola virus, and botulinum toxin) on at least 10 other occasions. Despite several releases, it was unsuccessful in its use of biologicals. This program is examined more thoroughly in chapter Case Studies.\u2022Several small-scale incidents involving the biological poison ricin (refer to Fig. 1.3\n) have occurred since the Amerithrax incident. Here are the more notable ones:\u2022In 2003 several letters containing ricin were recovered from a mail-sorting center in Greenville, South Carolina. A note from someone calling themselves the \u201cFallen Angel\u201d accompanied those letters.\u2022In 2004 ricin was sent to the office of Senator Bill Frist. Some federal investigators believe that this instance may be tied to the Fallen Angel, but no one has been identified for this biocrime or the 2003 incident.\u2022In 2013 ricin was sent to US President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A woman from Shreveport, Louisiana, was arrested for this biocrime and later convicted on several charges.\u2022Also in 2013 a letter containing ricin was sent to President Barack Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland. A Tupelo, Mississippi man was convicted of crimes related to these incidents and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\u2022In 2014 a Philadelphia man sent a romantic rival a scratch-and-sniff birthday card laced with ricin.

Terrorist groups seek biological weapons; we know some rogue states already have them\u2026It\u2019s important that we confront these real threats to our country and prepare for future emergencies.\nIt is clear that September 11 and the anthrax attacks of 2001 sent the country to war and sparked several initiatives against all forms of terrorism.\n",

Most biological weapons are made up of living microorganisms, which means that they can replicate once disseminated. This possibility amplifies the problem and the effect of the weapon in several ways. First, some agents are capable of surviving in various different hosts. The target might be humans, but the disease may manifest in other animal hosts, such as companion animals (pets). In doing so, the problem may be more difficult to control. Second, when people become infected with a disease-causing organism, there is an incubation period before signs of illness are apparent. During this incubation period and the periods of illness and recovery, the pathogen may be shed from the victim, causing the contagion to spread (a possibility only with diseases that are transmitted from person to person). There is no rule of thumb for how many people might be infected from a single patient. However, the nature of contagion clearly compounds the problem well beyond the initial release of the agent. In this instance the initial victims from the intentional outbreak become more weapons for the perpetrator, spreading the problem with every step they take. As Grigg et al. (2006) stated so precisely in their paper, \u201cwhen the threat comes from the infected population, self-defense becomes self-mutilation.\u201d The would-be terrorist could surely derive great pleasure from watching government officials and responders tread on the civil liberties of such victims as they attempt to limit the problem from spreading among the population.",

The first three steps are designed to get small quantities of seed stock to propagate into a starter culture, grow them to a significant stage of growth in the proper volume, and turn those active cells into spores. The goal of the last two steps is to separate the spores from the dead vegetative cells and spent media. All five steps have dozens of secondary steps.

Stabilization and dissemination are important issues because of the susceptibility of the biological agents to environmental degradation, not only in storage but also in application. These issues are problems whether the end use is for biological weapons, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, pesticides, or food-related purposes. The susceptibility of the organisms to inactivation by the environment varies with the agent. As an example, anthrax spores released into the environment may remain viable for decades, whereas plague bacterium may survive for only a few hours. Loss of viability or bioactivity is likely to result from exposure to physical and chemical stressors, such as exposure to ultraviolet radiation (sunlight), high surface area at air\u2013water interfaces (frothing), extreme temperature or pressure, high salt concentration, dilution, or exposure to specific inactivating agents. This requirement of stabilization also extends to the methods of delivery because the organisms are very susceptible to degradation in the environments associated with delivery systems.\n",

Approximately 4400 people were hospitalized and about 100 people died as a result of the outbreak. The Milwaukee outbreak was attributed to failure of filtration processes at one of the two water treatment plants that served the city. Several deficiencies were found at the plant, including problems relating to a change in the type of water treatment chemicals used for coagulation of contaminants before the filtration step. Weather conditions at the time were unusual, with a heavy spring snowmelt leading to high source water turbidity and wind patterns that may have changed normal flow patterns in Lake Michigan, the raw water source for the city.Critical ThinkingDescribe the fundamental difference between biodefense and biosecurity.\n",

Some of the most insidious disease agents ever to afflict humans, animals, and plants have been mass produced and perfected for maximum effectiveness. Terrorist groups and rogue states may be seeking to develop bioweapons capabilities. These significant developments in bioweapons gave military leaders and politicians cause for great concern over the past few decades. The military necessity to protect the force and defend the homeland is the goal of a good biodefense program. Simply put, biodefense is the need for improved national defenses against biological attacks. These are national programs, mostly planned and carried out by military forces and other government agencies. Initially, biodefense programs require an intelligence-gathering capability that strives to determine what may be in the biological weapons arsenal of an aggressor. Intelligence is needed to guide biodefense research and development efforts aimed at producing and testing effective countermeasures (ie, vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and detection methods). In addition, a real-time reporting system should be developed so that officials can be informed about an emerging threat before an agent has a chance to affect armed forces and millions of people in the homeland. The development of integrated systems for detecting and monitoring biological agents is instrumental to this goal. Although most biodefense initiatives rest with the military, civilian government agencies contribute greatly to the biodefense posture. This is evident by the increases in CBF over the past few years and will be discussed in great detail in Part IV of this book. On the other hand, biosecurity refers to the policies and measures taken for protecting a nation\u2019s food supply and agricultural resources from accidental contamination and deliberate attacks of bioterrorism.",

With all of this money the United States was able to build tremendous capabilities to detect and diagnose the agents and the diseases, respectively. With this money a few medical countermeasures (vaccines and treatments) were developed and produced. Centers of Excellence were funded and highly secure containment (biosafety level 4) laboratories were built. With these new programs, testing modalities, and laboratories came the need to provide a ready supply of positive control agents and contracting opportunities for private biotechnology firms. As one very recent example, the US Army laboratory in Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah, provided positive control samples of anthrax (B. anthracis) spores to public and private laboratories. Before shipment, the spores had been propagated in the Army laboratory and were exposed to gamma radiation to ensure no living spores were in the vials being provided. Upon receipt of the samples, one laboratory in Maryland questioned the integrity of the contents of the vial they received because there was no \u201cdeath certificate\u201d accompanying the samples. Out of an abundance of caution they removed a small portion of the vial and streaked it onto sheep blood agar plates. To their amazement, several days later the plates showed growth and tested positive for anthrax. They immediately notified the CDC and the Army. The CDC initiated an investigation and notified the media of the incident. The investigation showed that the living anthrax samples had been shipped to 69 laboratories in 19 US states and 5 other countries (USA Today, 2015).

Ebola virus exists naturally in fruit bats, with sylvatic transmission to other mammals and sometimes humans when they consume raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. Infection with Ebola virus in humans leads to severe viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), which is often fatal (CDC, 2015). In March 2014 an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) began in Guinea, a Western African nation. Public health agencies at all levels failed to react quickly to the outbreak and it quickly spread to urban areas in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Subsequently, EVD spread to Nigeria and Senegal. International air travel brought EVD to the United States and Europe, although the number of cases was very small and the threat was stamped out with ample infection control procedures in health-care facilities and aggressive public health measures for those exposed to actual case patients (CDC, 2015). This is the largest outbreak of EVD in history. At the time of this writing, the outbreak has been quelled by a \u201cbetter late than never\u201d effort. Volunteers and medical relief groups from the United States and other countries received special training and deployed to West Africa to help identify cases and treat the victims (see Fig. 1.4\n). However, new cases continue to be reported from Guinea and Sierra Leone. As of June 26, 2015, there have been 16,801 EVD cases (suspect, probable, and confirmed) worldwide with approximately 6411 deaths; this equates to a 38% mortality rate (WHO, 2015a).",

However, the stark reality is that international travel can interject EVD into any populace on any continent within a matter of days. No country, person, or organization is immune to this threat. What makes EVD such a great concern? First, Ebola virus is a US Health and Human Services Category A agent. It meets all of the criteria for such a designation. EVD results in high morbidity and mortality. EVD requires special preparedness measures for public health and health care. EVD is spread from person to person. EVD can lead to panic and social disruption (CDC, 2015). With this outbreak in particular, we are seeing all four criteria fulfilled. To make things worse, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine for humans and no FDA-approved drug for treating VHF case patients. In a health-care setting, EVD patients receive supportive care (hydration therapy) and rarely experimental drugs (CDC, 2015). Perhaps the only good thing to come from this outbreak is the development of a vaccine for Ebola virus. There are currently three vaccine candidates undergoing Phase III clinical trials in West Africa (WHO, 2015b).

Biowarfare has a history. The major events are important in helping us understand the issues related to using biological substances against an adversary. We now know the difference between biosecurity and biodefense and can relate them to homeland security and homeland defense, respectively. We also know how expensive these programs are because nearly $80 billion has been spent on civilian biodefense since FY2001 in the United States alone. As discussed herein, there is a significant difference in the reality and the potential of bioterrorism. Bioterrorism on a large scale is a low-probability event. Bioterrorism and biocrimes on a small scale (eg, small amount of ricin directed at one or a few individuals) are fairly routine occurrences with little potential. Biological threats remain very much in the news. Recent examples, such as laboratory incidents, the Ebola outbreak of 2014/2015, the outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea, and the HPAI outbreak affecting poultry in the United States, make us aware that we must remain vigilant and utilize the biosecurity and biodefense programs to help us identify and respond to these accidental exposures and emerging threats.",

Within these efforts are programs and agencies working toward increasing data collection, analysis, and intelligence gathering. The intelligence is applied to programs aimed at mitigating the effects of bioweapons by developing vaccines, therapeutics, and detection methods to increase the defensive posture.

The intentional use of microorganisms or toxins derived from living organisms to cause death or disease in humans or the animals and plants on which we depend. Bioterrorism might include such deliberate acts as introducing pests intended to kill US food crops; spreading a virulent disease among animal production facilities; and poisoning water, food, and blood supplies.\u2022\nBiowarfare, also known as germ warfare. The use of any organism (bacteria, virus, or other disease-causing organism) or toxin found in nature as a weapon of war. It is meant to incapacitate or kill an adversary.\n\u2022\nPathogen. A specific causative agent of disease, mostly thought of as being an infectious organism (eg, bacteria, virus, rickettsia, protozoa).\u2022\nWeaponization. When applied to biologicals, the term implies a process of taking something natural and making it harmful through enhancing the negative characteristics of it. With biological agents, one might weaponize the agent by making more lethal, more stable, and more easily delivered or disseminated against an intended target. There is considerable debate about the use of this term.\u2022\nZoonotic disease. An animal disease that may be transmitted to humans.\n",
