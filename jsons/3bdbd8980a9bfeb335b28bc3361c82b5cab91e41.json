The IN has a longer-term goal to reuse the resulting data and service infrastructure, also for future outbreaks. As a GO FAIR IN, VODAN will restrict itself to projects that are directly associated with FAIR data [1] and services relevant to COVID-19. This also means that VODAN will not concern itself with projects purely aimed at studying, for instance, transmission and severity genetics, experimental drug development, vaccine development or actual clinical interventions currently executed to control the epidemic. Only insofar as such activities are in need of access to, and processing of, FAIR data, VODAN partners can add FAIR data and services value.",

VODAN will also demonstrate the difference between 'FAIR' and 'open' by combining restricted data with opne data [2] . Second, this epidemic is particularly highly politicised, and there is little chance that countries (or even institutions) will 'share their RWO data' in the classical way, i.e. by 'sending' them to a central data warehouse, not even at WHO. A third issue to address is that, like in the earlier HIV epidemic, there will be so much money forthcoming for research and experimental interventions that there will be an enormous variety of overlapping, and even redundant projects and consequently a wave of data, of which a significant portion will be of questionable quality. This means that we need a strong emphasis on distributed analytics as well as on vetting and annotation of data, for which we need (expert) distributed annotation in near-real time. This can only be done with machine-assistance and through (expert) community-based massive annotation.",

The Data Together group and the VODAN partners fully endorse that, but also realise that the pandemic requires a globally coordinated response. The communities that have self-organised in the VODAN IN have assigned their coordinated activities to clusters. This was also needed in practice as the interest in VODAN in the first 2 weeks after its inception and approval was quite overwhelming (Fig. 1) . The clustering activity was started to ensure optimal synergy and convergence, as well as to enable easier coordination and support. We have asked early subscribers to take responsibility and coordination of subgroups addressing particular topics. The VODAN-IN will hopefully be an effective mechanism to coordinate globally dispersed and funded efforts, with co-leading participation of all continents, including Africa, to jointly rise to the challenge and ensure that what is implemented for COVID-19 is sustainable and scalable. On the other hand, it is important to manage expectations clearly and to spell out the limitations of what can be achieved. Many other COVID-19 projects will mushroom and may or may not join or benefit from VODANcoordinated data and analytics activities, and data accessibility and analytics, even if distributed and massive, do not guarantee that we quickly find new approaches to combat the virus. However, approaching this challenge in genuine partnership around the globe is definitely needed (Fig. 2) .",
