            "text": "Post-colonial Nigeria has been plagued with various types of violent conflicts. A bloody civil war in which an estimated 1 million people were killed ravaged the country from 1967 to 1970. Accounts of the war, both real and in fictional forms, have been provided by several writers, including Amadi (1973), Achuzia (1986), Shillington (2005), St Jorre (1972), Madiebo (1980), Forsyth (1969), Kirk-Greene (1971), Iroh (1979), Ademoyega (1981), Adichie (2007), and Johnson (2017). Interethnic and intra-communal conflicts have also shaken the foundations of the nation since 1960 when colonial rule ended.1 Other violent conflicts that have plagued the country are religious conflicts in Kano, Bauchi, Kaduna, Kafanchan, Zaria, Jos, Maiduguri, and many other places. Blood-letting in the name of religion in these and other places in Nigeria has left thousands dead and wounded. Destruction of property in the course of religious violence in Nigeria has also wreaked economic calamity on the country. For instance, wanton destruction of property during the Maitatsene religious uprising in Kano from 1980 to 1985 resulted in the loss of lives and of millions of dollars.2 Clashes between members of the militant Shi\u2019ite religious sect and the Nigerian army in 2016 led to the demolition of an entire neighborhood in Zaria city.3 Violence perpetrated by militants aggitating for greater control over the oil resources of the Niger Delta has also taken a heavy toll on lives and property in the region.",

For many years, some Nigerians from the eastern part of the country who live in other parts of the country could not visit their ancestral homes because they were afraid of being kidnapped. Kidnapping for ransom that began in the Niger Delta region has now spread to other parts of the nation, including Lagos and Abuja. Other forms of violence in Nigeria are those perpetrated by the Niger Delta Avengers and cult groups, including the Badoo Boys.4 Nigeria\u2019s most recent orgy of violence is the ongoing killing and destruction of lives and property perpetrated by the so-called cattle herdsmen who have wreaked havoc in places such as Kaduna, Plateau, Benue and Taraba states. The image of nomadic cattlemen is no longer that of nomads who carry long sticks used in corralling their cattle; it is the image of battle-ready men who are armed with AK-47 rifles.",

A militant Islamic terrorist group whose official name is Ahlis Lidda\u2019awati wal-Jihad (People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet\u2019s Teachings and Jihad), but which is generally known as Boko Haram, has since 2009 carried out bloody bombing campaigns and armed attacks in its bid to overthrow the Nigerian government and establish an Islamic state (caliphate) over the country. Boko Haram began its bloody campaign in the city of Maiduguri but soon extended its influence over much of the north-eastern part of Nigeria. It initially concentrated its attacks on Bornu, Yobe and Adamawa states, but it soon successfully carried out suicide bombing campaigns and drive-by shootings in other parts of Nigeria including Abuja, the federal capital, Kano, Bauchi, Benue, Plateau and several other parts of the country.",

However, the sect is still able to successfully attack government targets and to launch suicide missions in several villages in the north-eastern part of Nigeria. In July 2017, it successfully ambushed members of a government team exploring for oil in north-east Nigeria during which the terrorists killed over seventy members of the team. Boko Haram\u2019s success in the attack clearly underscores the persistent threat it poses, despite the claim by the government that the group is a spent force. Its success in the attack also shows that the jihadist group has continued to acquire enough resources to attack what it may consider as targets of high value in the country.",

It views itself as being at war with the Nigerian state. Boko Haram also denies the legitimacy of the Nigerian government and constitution, and opposes secular Western-style education. The terrorist group opposes democracy and rejects Christianity in Nigeria, and it seeks to convert Christians and other non-Muslims to Islam. Other things that have incurred the ire of the group have included the consumption of alcohol and participation in civic activities such as voting and running for elective posts. The terrorist group, operating in the name of Islam, rejects any ideology and teachings of the faith that differs from its own. It sees itself as part of a global movement for the restoration of the glories of Islam.",

It provides a critical analysis of Boko Haram\u2019s media strategy and shows that its social media messaging is part of its overall military and ideological strategies. The authors examine Boko Haram\u2019s attempts to wage a battle for the hearts and minds of Nigerians through a deliberate use of social media to disseminate its messages. Focusing on statements and video appearances by its leader, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram\u2019s overt and subtle messages to Nigerians and the world at large are outlined. Using content-analytic methodology, the chapter examines the thrust of the messages to decipher their major themes, intents and target audiences. The authors contend that Boko Haram\u2019s messages reveal what the group thinks of itself, the Nigerian government and the Nigerian security establishment. We contend that Boko Haram deliberately uses crude and unsophisticated messaging techniques to convey its brutality, military invisibility and total disdain for the Nigerian government and its armed forces. We contend that Boko Haram uses its social media messaging to assert the righteousness of its interpretation of Islam, arguing that Boko Haram uses Islamic religious imageries and rhetoric to justify its atrocities. We have analyzed Boko Haram\u2019s media strategy within the theoretical framework of propaganda and conclude that unlike IS, Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that use social media messaging as a recruitment tool, Boko Haram uses its messaging to instill fear and to convince its viewers of its inevitable victory over the Nigerian government. Our analysis reveals that not only does Boko Haram use its messaging to claim that the Nigerian government is anti-Islamic but also that it utilizes it to define good or proper Muslims.",

            "text": "As noted earlier, Boko Haram\u2019s reign of violence has been the biggest national security threat that Nigeria has faced since 1999 when the country returned to civil rule. It has also been the biggest blood-letting since the end of the Civil War in 1970. From August 2014 until February 2015 when combined military operations by Nigeria and its neighbors\u2014Cameroon, Chad, and Niger\u2014reversed Boko Haram\u2019s territorial gains, the Jihadist group controlled a good portion of Nigeria. During that period, it controlled fourteen local governments areas, several major towns and many villages\u2014swathes of Nigerian territories that amounted to over 70,000 square miles, about the size of Belgium, and six times more land than IS in Iraq and Syria controlled at about the same time. All of the territories amounted to about 20 % of Nigeria, according to a New York Times report.5 According to a November 15, 2015 report in the New York Times, Boko Haram was responsible for 6664 deaths in 2014, overtaking IS, which killed 6073 in the same year as the world\u2019s most number one terrorist organization. Like IS in Iraq and Syria, it decapitates some of its enemies by slitting their throats. In fact, it openly pledged allegiance to IS in March 2015. Like IS, it intends to create an Islamic caliphate. Unlike IS, however, what Boko Haram opposes is more certain than what it intends to do with power.",

According to the report, Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno State, noted that 2.1 million people had been displaced, and property worth $9 billion destroyed by Boko Haram as at December 2016. In addition, Shettima said that 956,453 private houses, representing 30 % of the number of houses in Borno State, were destroyed across the twenty-seven local government areas of the state. In a single attack on the city of Baga in January 2015, for example, Boko Haram killed over 2000 people.6 Churches, banks, schools, markets, car parks, farms, government offices, police stations and military barracks have been the principal targets of Boko Haram\u2019s attacks. Suicide bombings, motorcycle ride-by shootings, detonation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and invasions by a large contingent of its fighters are the main instruments of the terrorists\u2019 destructive strategies. In addition to creating millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs), Boko Haram has forced over 300,000 Nigerians to seek refuge in neighboring countries. An editorial in The Guardian (Nigerian) newspaper of November 13, 2014 stated that \u201cthere were in Cameroun alone, 33,000 Nigerians that fled Gwoza, a town in Borno State\u2026.\u201d Although Boko Haram began its terrorist activities in Nigeria, it has become a regional menace in West Africa as it has spread its attacks to Niger, Cameroon, and Chad.",

Apart from the humanitarian crisis created by the jihadist organization, the economic costs of the violence have been enormous. By September 2015, Boko Haram had destroyed infrastructure that would cost more than $1 billion to rebuild in Borno State alone (Ibukun and Olukayode, 2015). Shehu (2015) has argued that violent attacks by Boko Haram paralyzed businesses, banking, tourism, transportation and investments in the affected region. The group has seriously disrupted agricultural production, the mainstay of the economy in the area. Drastic reduction in agricultural production has created a specter of famine for millions of people in the violence-ravaged areas. In 2014, the Nigerian government budgeted 12 billion Naira to feed people in internally displaced persons\u2019 camps. The government earmarked 47 billion Naira in the 2017 budget for that purpose. According to the Presidential Committee on North-East Initiatives (PCNI), this was grossly inadequate as the figure to feed the IDPs at the displaced camps should have been 108 billion Naira. Quoting a United Nations estimate, The Economist magazine in its September 1, 2016 issue reported that \u201c240,000 children in Borno are suffering from severe acute malnutrition\u2014the deadliest category of it. More than 130 persons will die each day without assistance. Across the wider north-east part of Nigeria, a population equivalent to New Zealand\u2019s, is in need of food aid.\u201d Searcey and Santora (November 18, 2015), noted how Boko Haram\u2019s violence has caused food shortages in Cameroon. According to their report in the New York Times: \u201cFarmers have fled, leaving behind fallow fields. Herdsmen have rerouted cattle drives to avoid the violence. Throughout the region, entire villages have emptied, leaving a string of ghost towns with few people for Boko Haram to dominate\u2014and little for the group to plunder.\u201d7 Boko Haram\u2019s attacks on Baga and other fishing communities in the Lake Chad area have drastically reduced the quantity of fish harvested in the area. Attacks by Boko Haram have also curtailed tourism in the north-western part of Cameroon as well as various parts of north-eastern Nigeria. In addition, the Nigerian government has expended billions of dollars in extra defense in response to Boko Haram.",

Boko Haram uses its media strategy to advance its military goals as it frequently utilizes video appearances by its leader, Abubakar Shekau, to threaten military attacks. We also seek to demonstrate, using Boko Haram for illustrative purposes, that social media make it relatively easy for extremist groups such as Al Shabaab, IS, Al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups to articulate and disseminate their messages to a worldwide audience, a global reach that would not have been possible without the commitment of enormous and resources. A group such as Boko Haram may be particularly successful in articulating its messages when it is not confronted with counter-narratives by governments and other entities, or when the counter-narratives appear less persuasive than the propaganda that the group is churning out.",

Blaker (2015), examining IS\u2019 use of social media, asserted that:ISIS has made great use of the Internet and online social media sites to spread its message and encourage others, particularly young people, to support the organization, to travel to the Middle East to engage in combat\u2014fighting side-by-side with other jihadists, or to join the group by playing a supporting role\u2014which is often the role carved out for young women who are persuaded to join ISIS.

After his expulsion from two mosques for preaching a radical brand of Islam, he set up his own mosque and was able to attract a large following among the city\u2019s young men. The group became better known in 2009 when it clashed with the police, attacking police stations and other public institutions in Maiduguri. When the police could not contain the group, the federal government deployed the armed forces. The military fought pitched battles with Boko Haram fighters, and its mosque and headquarters were destroyed. Yusuf was apprehended by the military and handed over to the police; he was subsequently shot to death while being held in police custody. According to Mu\u2019azu (2011), the police stated that he died during gunfire exchanges with their officers. Yusuf\u2019s father-in-law and about eight hundred members of Boko Haram were killed during the fighting in 2009. Some of the group\u2019s survivors fled to the neighboring countries of Chad and Niger. Boko Haram was able to recover from its losses, and, as subsequent events clearly demonstrated, it became even more deadly. It is now led by another young cleric, Abubakar Shekau. However, one Abu Musab al-Barnawi claims that he leads another faction of the group.",

Evidence of the group\u2019s military capability is the use of rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft guns in its May 2013 attacks on Bama and its September 12, 2014 downing of a Nigeria Air Force jet plane.9 While its immediate grievances are directed against the federal government of Nigeria, Boko Haram operates under a global brand of Islamic fundamentalism. It is thus a grievous error to view the group solely through the prism of the internal dynamics of Nigerian politics. Its ability to attract fighters from Niger and Chad as well as its pledge of allegiance to IS in March 2015 and the acknowledgement that some of its fighters are trained in Somalia and Mali are clear pointers to its global dimensions. Even though some of its complaints are wrapped around Nigeria-specific issues, Boko Haram is motivated by a global Islamic radicalism. As was the case with Al-Shabab in Somalia and Al Dine in Mali, Boko Haram has struck with a deadly force in Nigeria because the country\u2019s poor governance made it a target of opportunity. The group merely capitalized on the weakness of the Nigerian state, and exploited existing ethnoreligious tensions to launch its insurgency against the country. The external dimensions of Boko Haram are also signposted by the similarities between its tactics and those adopted by Islamic insurgents in Iraq, Afghanistan and North Africa. This is not a mere coincidence. Boko Haram\u2019s suicide-bombing, co-ordinated simultaneous attacks on multiple targets, the use of IEDs and the utilization of motorcycle ride-by assassinations are precisely the methods that have recently been used by Islamic terrorists in other parts of the world.",

Its opposition to secular education recalls the ideology of the Taliban in Afghanistan. It is therefore fallacious to argue that Boko Haram is a political tool of Northern Nigerian elites who were unhappy with the President Goodluck Jonathan administration. The 2009 clashes between Boko Haram and security forces that marked the group as a serious threat to Nigerian security pre-dated the Jonathan administration. It was a Northerner, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, who was president of the country at that time. Moreover, given the opportunity, Boko Haram will go after the elites as ferociously as it has gone after ordinary Nigerians. Its January 2013 attempt to assassinate the former Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, during which the Emir\u2019s driver and some of his loyal bodyguards were killed, is a testament to its loathing and disdain of the elites. This was also attested to when the group warned the elites in Sokoto to avert the replication of the Kano attack by releasing its members who had been detained in that state. In a January 2012 letter, its leader, Shekau, said:This is an open letter to the Emir of Sokoto (Sultan of Sokoto) Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar 111, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal and the Acting Governor of Sokoto State. Before we visited Kano, we wrote open letter [sic] to senior citizens on the imperative of releasing our members but nobody cares [sic] to talk. Indeed, we sent three warnings to Kano before strike\u201d [sic]. What happened in Kano will be inevitable in Sokoto unless you (Sultan and others) intervene and ensure the immediate and unconditional release of our members who were specifically arrested in the city of Sokoto\u202610\n\n",

It intensified its attacks, and it increased the frequency of such attacks. Its ability to strike well beyond the geography of its home base was expanded with its attacks on Kano, Kaduna, Abuja and other cities several hundred miles from its home base. By the end of 2014, its ability to strike terror into the hearts of many Nigerians and its ability to seize swathes of territories at will made the north-eastern region and several other parts of northern Nigeria virtually ungovernable. As the group\u2019s mayhem intensified in 2013, a Nigerian national daily newspaper, The Nation, in its editorial commentary on January 8, 2013 aptly noted that:The scourge of Boko Haram has inflicted dislocations on our country on a number of levels. Some point to its psychological damage, others to the physical and geographical fissures and a few others to the decimation of families.

There is also much arrogance in Boko Haram\u2019s utterances and ultimate objectives. For instance, it aims to cleanse the north-eastern region of Nigeria, if not the entire country, of Christians and Christianity. It wants southern Nigerians living in the north to leave the region.

As Gambrill and Reiman (2011) have noted, propaganda aims to promote ideas and actions that would serve the interests and benefits of those promoting the ideas and actions. The word, propaganda, was derived from Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), a Vatican organization, created in Rome on June 22, 1622 by Pope Gregory XV (Bernays, 1928; Jackall, 1995; Pratkanis & Aronson, 2001). The organization\u2019s duty was to spread the faith and to regulate church affairs in heathen lands. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church used the term first (Black, 2001). Combs and Nimmo (1993) pointed out that this early form of propaganda was considered as \u201ca moral endeavor by the church\u201d (p. 201), but interest in the subject today has expanded owing to its importance in international politics (Chapman, 2000). According to Lasswell (1927a, 1927b), propaganda refers solely to the control of opinion by using pictures and other forms of social communication; it is concerned with the \u201cmanagement of opinions and attitudes.\u201d Qualter (1962) argues that propaganda is the deliberate attempt by an individual or group of persons to form, control or alter attitudes of other individuals or groups. He suggests that propaganda is any form of persuasion aimed to change attitudes.",

The group intended to use this video to serve two purposes. First, it aimed to persuade his audiences to believe that the jihadist sect was stronger than the Nigerian government. Secondly, the video aimed to show that the Nigerian government was untruthful and could not be trusted. When Boko Haram abducted the girls, the Nigerian government at first denied that the group had successfully done so. The wife of the president at the time, Patience Jonathan, as well as some government supporters, denied Boko Haram\u2019s claim that it had abducted the girls. Mrs Jonathan said that members of the opposition political party had fabricated the abduction story as a smear campaign against her husband, who was getting ready to run in the 2015 presidential election. Kema Chikwe, a prominent leader of the then ruling People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), added her voice to President Jonathan\u2019s wife\u2019s denial. As Chikwe contended that Boko Haram did not abduct any girls in the school, on April 30, 2014 she challenged the authorities of the school to release the names and pictures of the girls as a proof of the abduction. Chikwe\u2019s comments were published in the May 1, 2014 issue of National Leadership, one of Nigeria\u2019s dailies. According to the paper, Chikwe said: \u201cThere are many questions to be asked and many more to be answered. How did it happen? Who saw it happen? Who did not see it happen?\u201d",

To prove the veracity of his group\u2019s successful abduction of the Chibok girls, he released a video showing the girls squatting on the ground, wearing black veils over their heads and reciting the Quran. In the video, Shekau spoke in Hausa, Arabic and English. For the first fourteen minutes of the fifty-seven-minute video, he took a swipe at the concept of democracy, Western education and efforts by Muslims and Christians to live in peace. To persuade his audiences that Boko Haram was strong and that Nigerian government lied about the abduction, he said: \u201cI abducted a girl at a Western education school and you are disturbed. I said Western education should end. Western education should end. Girls, you should go and get married.\u201d Shekau further said: \u201cI will repeat this: Western education should fold up. I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market by Allah. I will marry off a woman at the age of twelve. I will marry off a girl at the age of nine.\u201d The video can be viewed at http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/may/06/boko-haram-sell-girls-market-video.

The Nigerian government at first claimed that it never lost any air force jet planes. The former Director of Defence Information of the army at the time, Major-General Chris Olukolade, said: \u201cWe are definitely searching for the jet, it is too early to either talk of a crash or attack by the insurgents.\u201d (Alli, March 10, 2014). Following the government\u2019s denial, Shekau released a video that showed the wreckage of the jet plane and the captured pilot. In the video, he shows the pilot\u2019s own confession in the English language. The video also shows burned parts of a Nigerian air force plane in the bush, with the pilot in a camouflage vest kneeling on the ground, as well as a member of the Islamist sect hovering over him with an axe. Boko Haram later claimed that it would behead the pilot. In the video, the pilot identifies himself as a Wing Commander in the Nigerian Air Force, and says he was undertaking a mission in the Kauri area of Borno State on September 11, when his plane was shot down by Boko Haram fighters. He says: \u201cWe were shot down and our aircraft crashed. To this day I don\u2019t know the whereabouts of my second pilot.\u201d Shekau used the video of the downed plane to persuade his followers and audiences to believe that the Nigerian government was being untruthful.",

However, as new military commanders, including Lieutenant-General Yusuf Buratai, the Chief of Army Staff, took over and began to take the fight to Boko Haram, the tables were turned against it. For over a year, Shekau was not heard from. He has begun to speak again but his threats now sound hollow. Although Boko Haram continues to launch deadly attacks, it has been uprooted from all the towns and villages which it had captured from Nigerian forces. In addition, it has been driven out of Sambisa Forest, which for many years served as its operational base for attacks. Shekau is now on the run and even his leadership of the group has been threatened from within. Boko Haram\u2019s serious military setbacks have not totally silenced its social media propaganda but its loud and boastful braggadocio has been reduced to an occasional whimper. As has been the case of IS, military defeats blunt the allure of terrorist propaganda. They demystify terrorists and their seeming ruthless efficiency and invisibility. Initially, Nigeria did not have a credible means to counter Boko Haram\u2019s social media messaging but militarily routing of Boko Haram has proven to be the most effective response to the group\u2019s reign of terror both on the battlefield and on social media.",
