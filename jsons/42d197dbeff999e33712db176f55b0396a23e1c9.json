Over the last several years, the total number of HCTs performed worldwide has exceeded 60,000 a year (Niederwieser et al. 2016; Gratwohl et al. 2010 ). Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) accounts for the majority of all procedures performed, and in the United States, the number continues to increase at a fast rate, mainly from transplants performed for plasma cell and lymphoproliferative disorders extending to older patients (Gratwohl et al. 2010 ; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 2016). Allogeneic HCTs (allo-HCT) have exceeded 30,000 per year worldwide with the number of transplant recipients surpassing 8000 a year in the United States (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 2016). Approximately 70% of allogeneic transplants use hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from volunteered unrelated donors (URDs). Advances in HLA typing, new immunosuppressive protocols, improved supportive care, and the administration of nonmyeloablative (NMA) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens contribute to the increased frequency of HCT. The observed continuous annual increase of around 10% is mainly because of a rise in allo-HCT from URDs (Gratwohl et al. 2010 (Gratwohl et al. , 2013 .

For allogenic donors, it is important to optimize the whole donation experience as these donors will undergo a procedure for which they will not be receiving any direct benefit.

These regulations are based on the FDA's responsibility to limit the transmission of infectious diseases through the administration of these products and apply to peripheral blood stem cells, cord blood, and donor lymphocytes.

These national registries develop and establish appropriate guidance to ensure HPC donation is performed safely and ethically in volunteer URDs and have published their recommendations for donor evaluation (Sacchi et al. 2008; Lown et al. 2014 ; National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) n.d.-a). Donors are assessed as to their suitability and eligibility to donate HPCs. Donor suitability refers to the general health or medical fitness of any autologous or allogeneic HPC donor to undergo the collection procedures. Donors are evaluated as to their risk and overall safety to donate. Donor eligibility refers to issues that relate to an allogeneic donor for who all screening and testing has been completed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and who has been determined to be free of risk factors for relevant communicable diseases. URDs are only eligible if they are unrestrictedly healthy. Often however, physicians struggle with decision making as to the suitability of a relative as a donor that would not otherwise meet the suitability criteria for unrelated donation. The suitability criteria for related donors (RDs) is often less strict and with considerable variability between transplant centers. Differences between RDs and URDs may exist in mobilization and collection practices (Sacchi et al. 2008; Confer et al. 2011; O'Donnell et al. 2010; Clare et al. 2010) . Published data suggest that the risks for serious adverse events and reactions might be higher for RDs than for URDs, but the amount of adequate prospective data in the RD setting is still limited (Halter et al. 2009; Kodera et al. 2014 ). Many institutions have developed their own processes for the evaluation of RDs; historically, there had been no national guidance available. In 2015, the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Standing Committee on Donor Issues developed a consensus document with recommendations for donor workup and final clearance of family donors that would otherwise not be able to serve as URD because of age or preexisting diseases (Worel et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 444, "end": 464, "text": "(Sacchi et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 465, "end": 481, "text": "Lown et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1563, "text": "(Sacchi et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1583, "text": "Confer et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1606, "text": "O'Donnell et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1625, "text": "Clare et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1845, "text": "(Halter et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1864, "text": "Kodera et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2290, "end": 2309, "text": "(Worel et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Regulatory Guidance, National Registries, and Accreditation Agencies"}, {"text": "The FACT-JACIE (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy/Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT and EBMT) international standards were founded in 1994 to address obstacles faced when transplantation involves donors and recipients in different countries.

In rare cases, children may also be considered as potential donors for an adult sibling, parent, or other family member. Worldwide data indicate that more than 30% of children undergoing HCT receive allografts from siblings under the age of 18 (Miano et al. 2007) . The use of minors as HPC donors is considered medically safe (Pulsipher et al. 2005) and legally accepted given that no alternative approach of comparable effectiveness exists; however, donation of HPCs is not without risk (Pulsipher et al. 2013; Styczynski et al. 2012; Grupp et al. 2006 ) and appropriate medical evaluation of the donor is essential. The source of the graft (peripheral blood vs. bone marrow) has the greatest influence on the type of adverse events that may present. It is important to note that in children majority of grafts are of bone marrow origin. Side effects include pain, either from G-CSF treatment, placement of central venous catheter (CVC), or the puncture wounds made when harvesting bone marrow. Most young donors will require a CVC for apheresis, thus, exposing them to potential risks such as bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, and complications of sedation or general anesthesia (Pulsipher et al. 2005; Styczynski et al. 2012) . Collection of peripheral blood graft requires special attention in children, with the use of growth factors being the main issue. Long-term adverse effects from a brief treatment course with G-CSF for the harvest of HPCs via apheresis continues to be studied in ongoing investigations, but to date, no convincing evidence has shown significant health risks (Pulsipher et al. 2006 ). The worldwide network for blood and marrow transplantation (WBMT) recommends G-CSF is used with caution and only when needed and emphasize the need for long-term follow-up for these donors (Halter et al. 2013) . Several published findings suggest that pediatric donors may experience psychosocial issues around the time of and following donation including higher anxiety and lower self-esteem than non-donors (Packman et al. 2008) , moderate levels of post-traumatic stress, depression, behavioral problems, identity problems, guilt, and resentment (Packman et al. 1997 (Packman et al. , 2008 Wiener et al. 2007) .

There is experience available in the literature for donors up to the age of 75 years. Many health disorders are more prevalent with increasing chronological age, including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, chronic airways diseases, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, etc., and must be taken into consideration by any provider assessing the suitability of an older individual to donate. In some reports, HPC collection by apheresis seems to be a safe procedure for donors \u226560 including those with significant comorbidities (Ghada et al. 2006 ). However, certain complications are more frequent in the older donors and have demonstrated more procedure related complications than younger donors (Lys\u00e1k et al. 2011) . For example, one study demonstrated higher complications associated 1. There is no medically equivalent histocompatible adult relative who is willing and able to donate 2. There is a strong personal and emotionally positive relationship between the donor and recipient 3. There is a reasonable likelihood that the recipient will benefit 4.

A recent related-donor safety study, looking at health-related quality of life issues among older related HCT donors (>60 years) compared to younger adult counterparts, showed very few differences in indicators in physical and mental health donation-related experiences (Switzer et al. 2017 ). This may suggest that older sibling donors do not experience the donation process as significantly more physically or psychologically impactful than their younger counterparts and, in some aspects, their experiences were more positive-for example, less donationrelated pain and less anxiety about donation.

In a concession to the spirit of NOTA, it was deemed that the compensation could not be in the form of cash but rather a voucher that can be applied to things such as scholarships, education, housing, or donation to a charity. In 2011, the WMDA put out a position statement why HPC donors should not be paid (Boo et al. 2011) . Reasons included ethical concerns raised by remuneration, potential to damage the public will to act altruistically, the potential for coercion and exploitation of donors, increased risk to patients, and harm to local transplantation programs and international stem cell exchange, and the povssibility of benefiting some patients while disadvantaging others.
