            "text": "There is no more universal feature of human thinking than the tendency to draw similarities or likenesses between people, objects and events in the world. Not all these similarities play a role in reasoning \u2013 many analogies that we employ in thinking and language have stylistic or figurative uses or fulfil a descriptive or explanatory function.1 But for the substantial number of analogies that play a logical role in our thinking about public health problems,2 it will be argued in this chapter that that role is a largely facilitative one. Indeed, it will be contended that even so-called false arguments from analogy can confer significant gains on our thinking when adverse epistemic conditions obtain in a particular context or scenario. These conditions are frequently encountered in a public health context where both expert scientists and lay people must come to judgement on problems in the absence of complete knowledge. This view of analogical argument requires a new approach to the study of this argument. Within this approach analogical reasoning is not viewed through a deductive or an inductive lens with all the pejorative evaluations that this has historically entailed. Rather, analogical argument must be seen as a rational adaptation of one\u2019s cognitive resources to the problem of uncertainty in practical reasoning. It is within this context that analogical argument, construed as a presumptively valid argument, can be seen to facilitate inquiry or deliberation by bridging gaps in the knowledge of a cognitive agent. This analysis of analogical argument has been initiated elsewhere (Cummings 2002, 2004, 2010, 2014d, e). However, it will be developed at length in the present chapter.",

            "text": "The discussion will unfold along what are by now familiar lines. In Sect. 5.2, the logical structure of analogical argument will be considered along with historical and more recent characterizations of this argument. It will be argued that a latent deductivism in logic is responsible for the largely negative accounts of this argument that have appeared in logical treatises and even some modern textbooks. Analogical argument is used extensively in public health, both in risk assessments and in communications with the public. Yet, there has been relatively little examination of the use of this argument in a public health context. Several examples of the use of analogies in public health reasoning will be considered in Sect. 5.3. It is as a presumptive argument that analogies may be seen to function as a rational adaptation to the problem of uncertainty during practical reasoning. But when an analogy is strong or rationally warranted, analogical argument may also be used to shift a proponent\u2019s burden of proof onto an opponent in argument. These different uses of the argument are at all possible because presumptive arguments exhibit both dialectical and epistemic features. Dialectical and epistemic variants of analogical argument are examined in Sect. 5.4. The critical questions that attend the use of the dialectical variant of this argument can only be successfully transacted within a slow, deliberative process of reasoning (systematic reasoning). The identification of markers of strong and weak analogies requires a less deliberative form of reasoning that embodies cognitive efficiencies (heuristic reasoning). Both forms of reasoning are addressed at length in Sect. 5.5. Finally, the extent to which subjects make use of these two forms of analogical argument during reasoning about public health problems is addressed in Sect. 5.6.",

In his text Fallacies, Alfred Sidgwick leaves the reader in little doubt about his disregard for the argument from analogy. The argument is not even a pretender to deduction, according to Sidgwick: \u2018the more definite the Principle the more the inference possesses the deductive character, the less definite the nearer it approaches to loose Analogy\u2019 (Chap. VI, Part II, p. 215). Analogical argument does not constitute a form of proof in Sidgwick\u2019s view: The argument from analogy is, properly speaking, not so much a mode of attempting proof, as a mode of attempting to dispense with the serious labour of proving. It lies at the end of the scale of cogency which is furthest from Demonstration. (Chap. VI, Part II, p. 232)\n",

They state that \u2018[a]rguments by analogy are not to be classified as either valid or invalid; probability is all that is claimed for them\u2019 (484; italics added). Gensler (2010) reveals his deductivism through his characterization of the argument from analogy as an analogy syllogism. Moreover, of one particular analogical argument about other minds, he remarks that \u2018it at most makes it only somewhat probable that there are other conscious beings\u2019 (99; italics added). Authoritative online sources perpetuate the same deductivism. For example, at the outset of his entry on analogy and analogical reasoning in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Bartha (2013) remarks \u2018such arguments belong in the category of inductive reasoning, since their conclusions do not follow with certainty but are only supported with varying degrees of strength\u2019 (italics added).

This argument draws upon an analogy between BSE and scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in sheep. This analogy was used extensively by scientists in risk assessments of BSE. It was also the basis of repeated public health communications that were intended to reassure the public that BSE would not transmit to humans. The form of the argument that is shown in (1) below is one of several variants which were used extensively during the BSE epidemic (see Cummings (2010) for further discussion): (1)Scrapie in sheep and BSE in cattle are similar in respect of histopathology and epidemiology.Scrapie has not transmitted to humans.Therefore, BSE will not transmit to humans.\n",

Early investigations of the epidemiology of BSE conducted by Mr John Wilesmith of the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey revealed, among other things, that the distribution of BSE cases was consistent with the distribution of meat and bone meal (MBM) which was made from recycled sheep tissues (Wilesmith et al. 1988). All BSE cases had also been fed commercial concentrates which contained MBM (Wilesmith et al. 1988). Aside from epidemiological similarities, there was also evidence that BSE had similar histopathological features to scrapie. Like scrapie, vacuolation was present in the neurones of grey matter in BSE cases. Also, fibrils that were morphologically similar to scrapie associated fibrils were found in BSE cases (Wells et al. 1987). Such were the early similarities between BSE and scrapie that it appeared to investigators that BSE was none other than bovine scrapie. So it was that early in the course of the BSE epidemic many scientists had already come to the view that scrapie had transmitted to cattle to cause BSE.",

Here again, investigators appeared to view this relation as having some degree of rational warrant. However, the presumptive nature of this warrant meant that this relation could be overturned by the later emergence of evidence. In fact, this is exactly what happened when the results of strain-typing studies became available to BSE investigators. These studies were not technically possible when BSE first emerged in British cattle in 1986. When these studies were eventually conducted, they showed that BSE was not related to scrapie but was in fact a novel TSE in cattle. What these studies had effectively demonstrated was that two diseases could be similar in respect of features such as histopathology and epidemiology and yet still be essentially unrelated diseases.

Similarities in the epidemiology of these diseases led investigators to conclude that the pathogen responsible for AIDS must be transmitted sexually and parenterally in exactly the same way that hepatitis B is transmitted sexually and parenterally.4 The argument from analogy which was the basis of the CDC advice took the form shown in (2): (2)AIDS and hepatitis B have similar epidemiological features.Hepatitis B is transmitted sexually and parenterally.Therefore, AIDS will be transmitted sexually and parenterally.\n",

The reconstructed analogical argument to which Plant refers takes the form shown in (3): (3)SARS is similar to other viruses.Other viruses are spread predominantly via the respiratory route.Therefore, SARS will be spread predominantly via the respiratory route.\n",

The issue in question concerns the teratogenic effects of taking sodium valproate (Epilim) during pregnancy. From newspaper reports to blogs and parental narratives, public discourses on this issue have increasingly involved an analogy with Thalidomide, a drug that was widely used in the 1960s to control morning sickness during pregnancy. In at least some of these discourses, this has been used to support the view that Epilim is responsible for a range of birth and developmental anomalies in babies and children who were pre-natally exposed to this drug. This logical analogy was made by Paul Flynn, for example, who is the Labour Member of Parliament for Newport West in Wales. In his blog of 11 March 2013, Flynn remarked of Epilim that \u2018[i]t could be worse than Thalidomide for the same reasons\u2019. This italicised expression attests to the well-established causal link between the ingestion of Thalidomide during pregnancy and the development of birth defects, a link which Flynn is clearly implying holds true of Epilim also. The argument from analogy which is implicit in Flynn\u2019s view is shown in (6) below: (6)Epilim and Thalidomide are prescribed medicines sometimes taken during pregnancy.Thalidomide has teratogenic effects on a developing foetus.Therefore, Epilim will have teratogenic effects on a developing foetus.\n",

However, these drugs are dissimilar in other, significant respects. First, they are used to treat different conditions. Epilim is used to manage a serious, neurological disorder (i.e. epilepsy), while Thalidomide was used to treat an unpleasant, but not life-threatening, symptom of pregnancy. Second, these drugs do not contain the same active ingredients. The chemical ingredients which gave rise to serious birth defects in the case of Thalidomide are not present in Epilim. A causal link may eventually be demonstrated between the ingestion of Epilim during pregnancy and the development of conditions such as autism spectrum disorders in children.

The arguments in (1) to (6) above concern a wide range of public health issues including food and drug safety, infectious diseases and new technologies. Some of these arguments were employed by public health agencies such as the CDC, while others were a feature of how the public conceives of threats to its health. A number of analogies stood up well to scrutiny. They revealed genuine similarities between human diseases (e.g. AIDS/hepatitis B) and animal diseases (e.g. BSE/scrapie), for example, that could be used in support of conclusions about the transmission routes and host ranges of pathogens. Other analogies traded on similarities that were weak or superficial in nature (e.g. Epilim/Thalidomide). These analogies were shown to provide little or no rational warrant for the conclusions of several of the arguments in (1) to (6) above. Having examined the varied uses of the argument from analogy in a public health context, it remains for us to consider how these uses may be best analysed within logical frameworks. These frameworks contain dialectical and epistemic criteria that were used to evaluate each of the analogical arguments in this section. In order to contribute to a theory of public health reasoning, argument from analogy must first be analysed from within these frameworks. It is to this analysis that we now turn.",

Walton (2013) makes this point as follows: When an argument from analogy is initially put forward, it is possible that there is a strong or even striking similarity between the case at issue and the analogous case. As the dialogue proceeds, however, questions may arise as to whether the two cases are similar in certain specific respects or dissimilar in other respects. It is a sequence of argument moves during a particular stage of a dialogue that determines how strong the argument from analogy should be taken to be, from a logical point of view. It is this dialogue sequence that should provide the basis for evaluating the strength of the argument from analogy. (142)\n",

According to Walton (2012), this is best achieved through the use of scripts of the type formulated by Schank and Abelson (1977) in early work in artificial intelligence: \u2018Story schemes allow us to answer the critical questions for the analogy scheme in more detail than any other evaluation has so far done\u2019 (217). A script or scheme is a body of knowledge of events and actions and how they typically unfold and interrelate based on our experience of the world. So, for example, I may have a restaurant script that includes information to the effect that a customer enters a restaurant, requests a menu, orders one or more dishes, is served by a waiter, receives a bill, makes the required payment and then leaves the restaurant. Among the interrelations between actions in a script are those which are causal or temporal in nature. For example, a customer pays a bill because he ate a meal, and the meal is served after an order has been placed with the waiter. The motivations and intentions of the characters in an event can also be represented in a script. In demonstration of how scripts may be used to model the notion of similarity that is the basis of the similarity premise in the basic scheme of the argument from analogy, we return to the analogical argument in (2) above. That argument is repeated below for convenience: AIDS and hepatitis B have similar epidemiological features.Hepatitis B is transmitted sexually and parenterally.Therefore, AIDS will be transmitted sexually and parenterally.\n",

But equally interesting is the pattern recognition kind of similarity that is the basis of the first stage in Walton\u2019s tiered approach. This is a superficial type of similarity that might take the form of visual similarities between two cases. However, pattern recognition in humans is not limited to sensory-based observations and can include recognition of complex patterns that cannot be apprehended by visual or other senses.5 This latter type of pattern recognition need not require significant cognitive expenditure in humans or necessitate computational complexity in artificial systems if a pattern recognition device is sensitive to simple markers of similarity between two cases. These markers may include the identification of existing knowledge on the part of scientists or of multiple similarities between two cases. They may also include the identification of certain features of the context in which an argument from analogy is advanced. All three markers of similarity can be illustrated by returning to the AIDS-hepatitis B analogy. This analogy exhibits the marker existing knowledge as scientists at the CDC had extensive knowledge and experience of hepatitis B when early cases of AIDS emerged. This case also exhibits the marker multiple similarities as both AIDS and hepatitis B were identified to occur predominantly in homosexual males, intravenous drug users and recipients of blood and blood products rather than just one of these groups. The AIDS-hepatitis B analogy also displays an important context marker in that the analogy was pressed into use at the outset of the AIDS epidemic when little was known about this newly emerging disease.",

The AIDS-hepatitis B analogy exhibits all three markers and is a particularly strong analogy in consequence. The detection of these markers represents a form of pattern recognition that is little more complex than the identification of visual similarities between two cases. To appreciate this, it will help to conceive of these markers as entries within a checklist that a pattern recognition device can use to establish if certain features are present or absent in a particular analogy. For example, no extensive deliberation is required to decide in a particular scenario if scientists have existing knowledge of an infectious disease. Also, we do not have to deliberate long and hard to decide if two cases exhibit just a single similarity or multiple similarities. It can also be easily established if an analogy is advanced at the outset of an inquiry into an infectious disease or if it is used when considerable knowledge of this disease has already been amassed (a context marker). These judgements can be arrived at relatively quickly and easily. They are quite unlike the more elaborate judgements that are needed to decide whether a purported similarity between two cases is a true similarity between these cases. Judgements of this type do demand extensive deliberation as the similarity at issue in a particular case is subjected to critical questioning in a framework such as Walton\u2019s hybrid theory of argumentation schemes and story schemes. A pattern recognition device that is equipped to detect simple markers of similarity is not designed to obviate the need for an extended analysis of similarity of the type proposed by Walton. Rather, this device serves instead as an effective mechanism for distinguishing strong from weak analogies when a more extended analysis of similarity is not feasible or practicable in a particular case.",

In psychology, the presence of a similarity or \u2018representativeness\u2019 heuristic in human thinking was identified by Tversky and Kahneman (1974) in their landmark study of probabilistic reasoning.6 Although Tversky and Kahneman took a rather dim view of this heuristic \u2013 it led subjects, for example, to neglect prior probabilities in their probability evaluations \u2013 its presence nonetheless attests to the role of a simple similarity heuristic in human reasoning. Similarity or resemblance heuristics are known to play a role in face recognition (Kleider and Goldinger 2006).7 These same heuristics are impaired in individuals with autism. Behrmann et al. (2006) found that adults with autism are slower than neurotypical controls at face processing, especially as the level of categorization and perceptual similarity becomes more fine-grained. Attitude similarity has been found to function as a heuristic cue that signals kinship (Park and Schaller 2005). In this way, we are more inclined to have kinship cognitions about people with whom we share attitudes than about those whose attitudes are dissimilar from our own. In each of these cases, a simple pattern recognition type of similarity is presumed to underlie perceptions and judgements of similarity. A similar pattern recognition type of similarity is also posited for the epistemic variant of analogical argument.",

When evidence is available and there is time in which to assess its implications for a particular question-at-issue, cognitive agents typically engage in systematic reasoning. Analogies contribute in a myriad of ways to systematic reasoning. They are the means by which connections are forged between previously unrelated entities, events and states of affairs. These connections are the source of insights into new and puzzling phenomena about which little is known. In a public health context, these insights may include a better understanding of the origin, pathogenesis and transmission routes of an emerging disease. For example, investigators used an analogy between BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep to make assessments of the infectivity of bovine tissues, while scientists charged with responding to the emergence of AIDS used an analogy with hepatitis B to determine the routes of transmission of this new disease. In both cases, an analogy with a pre-existing disease became a productive source of theses about a newly emerging disease. The productivity of analogy can be demonstrated in specific ways in the context of systematic reasoning. Analogies are first and foremost the basis of similarity premises in analogical arguments of the following form: Argument from analogy:BSE and scrapie are similar in certain respects (similarity premise).In scrapie, the thymus is less infective than other tissues in the lymphoreticular system.8\nIn BSE, the thymus will be less infective than other tissues in the lymphoreticular system.\n",

As well as generating new theses or claims for reasoning, analogies also steer investigators in the direction of potentially beneficial lines of inquiry. A strong analogy comes with an implicit recommendation. It tells scientists to investigate x over y, as the former is more likely to succeed in addressing the question-at-issue. In directing scientists towards some lines of inquiry and away from others, analogies can help scientists direct their cognitive and technical resources in ways that are likely to have a successful outcome. For example, an analogy between HIV/AIDS and another infectious disease, hepatitis B, had a reasonable prospect of helping scientists to understand the transmission routes of HIV/AIDS. However, the same could not be said of an analogy between HIV/AIDS and a chronic condition such as diabetes or even another infectious disease like tuberculosis. These weaker analogies (for analogies they are) were unlikely to address the question of the transmission routes of HIV/AIDS. As such, they would have represented a poor investment of the resources of scientists.",

These features include slow, deliberative evaluation of all the evidence that relates to a purported similarity between two cases. This evaluation is only possible to the extent that evidence is available to investigators. This condition restricts the contexts in which analogical argument can be employed as a type of systematic reasoning. Furthermore, this evaluation is conducted through the use of critical questions whereby the rational basis of a presumed similarity is progressively laid bare through successive dialectical exchanges between a proponent and opponent in argument. The context for this critical questioning may be a story scheme of the type proposed by Walton or some other dialectical framework. Regardless of how similarity is analysed, it is clear that the use of analogy in systematic reasoning has time and resource implications for cognitive agents. For any degree of critical questioning of a purported similarity between two cases requires time and involves the expenditure of substantial cognitive resources. What makes this expenditure worthwhile for agents is the maximization of the truth of their mental representations of the world that it makes possible.

That such a relation existed was established through the use of the following critical questions: What evidence is there of a causal or systematic relation between the demographic groups at risk of hepatitis B and the routes of transmission of this infectious disease? This question was effectively addressed by appealing to the substantial body of research that existed on the epidemiology of hepatitis B. This research consistently demonstrated a higher prevalence of hepatitis B infection among homosexual males and recipients of blood and blood products, among a number of other demographic groups. The increased prevalence of infection in these groups could only be explained if individuals were exposed to the causal pathogen in hepatitis B, a blood-borne virus, through sexual activity and epidermal injection (i.e. sexual and parenteral routes of transmission). So, a clear causal or systematic relation could be demonstrated between those individuals who were susceptible to hepatitis B and the routes of transmission of this infectious disease.

Alternatively, an extended process of critical questioning may be required to reveal the properties of an analogy and assess their rational merits. Even in a short dialectical exchange, a substantial investment of time is required in order for critical questions to be developed, raised and addressed.

In a public health context, these problems and their solutions can take many forms. They include decisions about how to contain the spread of an infectious disease through the use of vaccination programs and quarantine measures. They also include public health actions such as the banning of noxious substances in food production and the withdrawal of prescribed drugs and medical devices where these have been found to cause harm. These decisions and actions prioritize the protection of human health and are particularly pressing for this reason. A rational procedure such as systematic reasoning that attends to all evidence and weighs up its implications for the truth of a thesis is not always (or maybe ever) well suited to the resolution of problems in the practical sphere. In fact, such a procedure may be potentially harmful to cognitive agents who postpone the taking of urgent action in order to await the outcome of deliberation.

These markers, which include the identification of multiple similarities between two cases and existing knowledge on the part of investigators, require no extensive deliberation to determine their presence or absence in a particular scenario. In much the same way that cognitive agents can readily perceive all sorts of features of their environment, the proposal here is that these agents are also able to rapidly discern if two cases are related by a single property or more than one property. Moreover, they are able to use this rapid recognition to come to a quick judgement about the strength of an analogy. In this way, two cases which exhibit multiple similarities constitute an altogether stronger analogy than cases which are related by only a single property or feature. And while it is certainly possible to undertake a more thoroughgoing evaluation of the nature and extent of these similarities by means of critical questions during systematic reasoning, this critical questioning is not necessary or even possible in those contexts where analogy is employed as a heuristic.

Action of this type is only possible to the extent that agents are guided by heuristics in their decision-making and other rational procedures. Analogy is one such heuristic. Through the identification of simple markers of similarity, an analogical heuristic bypasses the more extensive deliberative process of systematic reasoning. By doing so, it can confer significant cognitive and practical gains upon agents. These gains include an ability to respond promptly to environmental challenges as agents can avoid the time-intensive process of critical questioning. The detection of simple markers of similarity also has few resource implications for agents. Resources such as attention and memory, which are used extensively during critical questioning, can be conserved or redirected to other tasks when analogy is employed as a heuristic. An analogical heuristic can be seen to satisfy the two most important challenges to any physically situated cognitive agent: the need to take action in the practical sphere and the need to make parsimonious use of valuable cognitive resources.

However, with an escalating number of infected cattle and the risk that the disease may transmit to humans, public health officials and scientists could not afford to take no action. Yet, the question of how best to direct that action in the absence of evidence from experimental studies posed a considerable challenge to investigators. An analogy between BSE and a brain disease in sheep known as scrapie stepped into this evidential gap. When BSE was first identified in 1986, there was insufficient knowledge of this new disease to subject this analogy to any degree of critical questioning during systematic reasoning.

The following public health scenarios were used to assess analogical argument: (1) the use of hepatitis B by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA as a model for HIV/AIDS health advice; (2) an investigation by environmental epidemiologists of illness that is possibly related to the presence of chemicals in drinking water; (3) the use of scrapie by British scientists to assess the risk of BSE to human health; and (4) a study by pharmacoepidemiologists of the health effects of a new arthritis drug. The first and third scenarios described actual public health problems, while the second and fourth scenarios described plausible, but non-actual events. Two scenarios presented strong analogies and two contained weak analogies. All scenarios were presented in the form of a written questionnaire which was completed anonymously by subjects in their own time. Each scenario was followed by four questions. Two questions asked about information that was explicitly presented in the passage which described the scenario. These questions were intended to create the impression amongst subjects that they were engaging in a reading comprehension task. A third question asked subjects to rate the analogy in the passage as valid, moderately valid or not valid at all. A fourth question encouraged subjects to expand upon the grounds for their validity rating in an effort to determine the logical and epistemic factors which were decisive in forming their judgement. The passages and questions that were used in each scenario can be found in Appendix 4a.",

In analogical argument, an analogy or similarity is drawn between two cases A and B in respect of certain properties or features. This analogy is then used to argue that if case A has property x then case B must also have property x. Analogical arguments can be more or less rationally warranted depending on the nature and extent of the purported similarity between two cases, and the degree to which there exists a causal or systematic relation between the known properties of these cases and the unknown property that is described in the conclusion. Several historical accounts of analogical argument were examined. These accounts were somewhat dismissive of the logical merits of this argument, a fact that was explained in terms of a pervasive deductivism in logic. The widespread use of analogical arguments in a range of public health problems was illustrated with the use of examples. Dialectical and epistemic analyses of this argument were then examined. These analyses emphasized the use of critical questions to interrogate the rational basis of a purported similarity between two cases (dialectical analysis) and the identification of simple markers of similarity (epistemic analysis). They corresponded to a now familiar distinction, that between the use of analogy in systematic and heuristic reasoning. Finally, the results of a study of public health reasoning were reported. These results tended to confirm a role for analogical argument in the reasoning of members of the public both as a cognitive heuristic and during systematic deliberation.",

            "text": "\nEven within public health, analogies can have a figurative, ethical or descriptive function. Examples include an analogy between infectious diseases and war (De Grandis 2011), between dose-response in toxicology and public health areas such as diet, alcohol and physical activity (Whitelaw 2012), and the use of normative analogies in establishing ways in which new and emerging technologies such as umbilical cord blood biobanking should be used (Hofmann et al. 2006). These analogies do not have an argumentative or logical function, although they may perform other, equally important roles: \u2018Figurative analogies do not argue, though they may elucidate\u2019 (Waller 2001: 200). Health analogies may also be imported into other fields such as the analogy between viral dynamics in humans and in computers (Eubank et al. 2008). For an extensive list of references on the use of analogy across different domains and disciplines, the reader is referred to Guarini et al. (2009). The reader cannot do better than Holyoak (2005) for an overview of analogy.Ness (2012) proposes the use of analogies as one of eleven tools for developing innovative thinking in epidemiology.Walton (1989b) makes this same point as follows: \u2018Many arguments from analogy that could be reasonable arguments unfortunately have to be evaluated as weak, questionable, or even fallacious if treated as inductive arguments. Why is this so? It is so because many powerful arguments from analogy are plausible arguments rather than inductive arguments\u2019 (258).Parenteral transmission is defined as that which occurs outside of the alimentary tract, such as in subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular and intrasternal injections (Berkley 1991).Duin and P\u0119kalska (2007) make this same point as follows: \u2018we are able to deal with much more complex patterns that may not directly be based on sensorial observations. For example, we can observe the underlying theme in a discussion or subtle patterns in human relations. The latter may become apparent, e.g. only by listening to somebody\u2019s complaints about his personal problems at work that again occur in a completely new job. Without a direct participation in the events, we are able to see both analogy and similarity in examples as complex as social interaction between people\u2019 (221\u2013222).Although Tversky and Kahneman (1974) use the expression \u2018representativeness heuristic\u2019, it is clear from their description of this heuristic that they have similarity in mind: \u2018Many of the probabilistic questions with which people are concerned belong to one of the following types: What is the probability that object A belongs to class B? What is the probability that event A originates from process B? What is the probability that process B will generate event A? In answering such questions, people typically rely on the representativeness heuristic, in which probabilities are evaluated by the degree to which A is representative of B, that is, by the degree to which A resembles B. For example, when A is highly representative of B, the probability that A originates from B is judged to be high. On the other hand, if A is not similar to B, the probability that A originates from B is judged to be low\u2019 (1124; italics added).Like the representativeness heuristic of Tversky and Kahneman, it is clear that Kleider and Goldinger (2006) view their resemblance heuristic as having a biasing effect on face recognition: \u2018resemblance refers to a heuristic strategy wherein recognition decisions are biased by a test item\u2019s thematic similarity to other studied items\u2019 (261). Kleider and Goldinger argue that this biasing effect can have serious implications for eyewitness memory.The thymus gland is one of several tissues that make up the lymphoreticular system. Other tissues include bone marrow, tonsils, spleen and lymph nodes. Additionally, in ruminants, there is primary lymphoid tissue in the gut called the ileal Peyer\u2019s patch.\n",
