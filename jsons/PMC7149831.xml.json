            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are important sources of morbidity, mortality, and loss of workforce days throughout the world. Patients at the extremes of age or with preexisting cardiopulmonary disease or immune suppression are at particular risk. Despite advances in our understanding of microbial pathogens and the development of new antimicrobial agents, acute respiratory tract infections continue to place an enormous burden on global health expenditure. Broadly speaking, acute respiratory tract infections can be divided into infections that predominantly affect the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. Anatomically, the vocal cords serve as the dividing line between these two areas with the upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx, peri-tonsillar structures, sinuses, larynx, and epiglottis) being proximal to the cords and the lower upper respiratory tract (bronchial tree and pulmonary parenchyma) being below the cords. Unlike any of the other vital organs, the lung is exposed daily to a large amount of pathogens present in air and is potentially vulnerable to infection and inflammation. For optimal gas exchange, the respiratory tract has a vast surface area (150 m2), a very thin delicate epithelium, and extensive blood flow. Inherent in this structure is an enormous immunological burden. The 11 000\u201315 000 liters of air inhaled daily contain a myriad of pathogens, pollutants, and allergens. In the normal lung, many inhaled microbes are trapped in the mucus layer coating the nasal epithelium and upper respiratory tract. Once trapped, they can be transported by ciliary motion to the pharynx and swallowed. For organisms that evade mucociliary clearance, further protective innate immune mechanisms act locally to facilitate clearance of inhaled pathogens and to modulate inflammatory responses. However, when these respiratory tract defenses are breeched, infection can occur, sometimes with devastating consequences for the host.",

            "text": "The common cold is a symptom complex characterized by nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, pharyngitis, and cough. Over 200 different viral agents including coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, parainfluenza, and influenza viruses are known to cause coryza although rhinovirus is the most common etiological agent. Transmission is by hand\u2013nose\u2013hand inoculation or by droplet spread; the incubation period is typically 48 to 72 hours. The illness may last for up to 1 week but in up to 25% of patients, it persists for 2 weeks. Immunity is short-lived and virus-specific; most adults will suffer between 2 and 4 coryzal illnesses annually. Children tend to have more frequent colds (6\u20138 per year) and cigarette smokers also have more frequent viral URTIs. Physical findings are generally confined to the upper respiratory tract and include nasal mucosal edema and pharyngeal erythema. Therapy is principally supportive and includes bed rest, paracetamol (0.5\u20131 g, 4\u20136 hourly) for systemic symptoms and fever and nasal decongestants in some cases. The benefits of vitamin C therapy remain unproven (Douglas et al., 2004; Sasazuki et al., 2006). Similarly, data supporting the wide use of the plant extract, echinacea, in coryza are lacking (Linde et al., 2006). Complications of coryza are predominantly due to secondary bacterial infections such as sinusitis (0.5% of cases), otitis media (2% of cases), bronchitis, and pneumonia.",

Death may occur from upper airway occlusion and asphyxiation. It is most common in children aged 2\u20133 years but can also occur in adults. The illness usually starts with fever and sore throat progressing rapidly with voice changes, drooling, stridor, and respiratory distress. The presence of stridor, voice muffling, rapid clinical course, and underlying diabetes mellitus have been shown to correlate with the need for airway intervention (Katori and Tsukuda, 2005). Direct visualization of the epiglottis may reveal an edematous, erythematous epiglottis projecting over the back of the tongue. Laryngoscopic blade examination should be avoided because of the risk of precipitating total airway obstruction. A lateral cervical X-ray may show epiglottic swelling (thumbprint sign). Blood cultures followed by prompt antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and chloramphenicol, or a third-generation cephalosporin and skilled invasive airway management, are the cornerstones of treatment. Orotracheal or nasal tracheal intubation is usually done under general anesthesia proceeding to tracheostomy if tracheal intubation is not possible.

Morbidity and mortality are significant, particularly at extremes of age and in those with underlying cardiorespiratory disease. Viral impairment of mucociliary clearance and macrophage function promotes secondary bacterial infection resulting in pneumonia, bronchitis, or otitis media caused by such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus peumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Therapy is mainly symptomatic with antipyretics, bed rest, and fluids. Amantadine may ameliorate the symptoms of influenza A if given within the first 24 to 48 h. It may also be used prophylactically in high-risk individuals in epidemics; however, resistance to this agent is emerging (Bright et al., 2005).

            "text": "Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the large conducting airways. It is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. Cough with or without purulent sputum in association with URTI symptoms suggest the diagnosis of acute bronchitis in an otherwise healthy patient. Bronchitis may present in a manner very similar to pneumonia differing only by the absence of signs of consolidation on chest examination and absent chest X-ray findings. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Influenza A and B, coronavirus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus have all been implicated. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for more than 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered. In the presence of underlying chronic pulmonary disease the manifestations and etiologic agents differ considerably from those seen in the normal host. Bacterial etiologies include H. influenzae, pneumococcus, M. pneumoniae, and B. catarrhalis. B. catarrhalis bronchitis is associated with impaired host defenses and is commonly seen in cigarette smokers or those with preexisting cardiopulmonary disease. Prolonged or high-grade fever is unusual with uncomplicated bronchial infections. Substernal burning or discomfort may be present together with wheeze and rhonci from large airway irritation. Recurrent bouts of acute bronchitis in children should prompt consideration of an underlying immune disorder or respiratory disorder such as cystic fibrosis. Supportive therapy with analgesia, antipyretics, adequate hydration, and assistance with expectoration of viscid secretions may be required. Antimicrobial treatment in acute bronchitis is controversial. The benefits of such treatment have been marginal in many studies, perhaps because of the viral nature of many cases. However, more recent guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians suggest that widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged (Braman, 2006).",

In this chapter, we have reviewed the various clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, likely etiological agents, and therapeutic considerations for patients who present with acute respiratory tract infections. With the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among many respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens, acute infections of the respiratory tract are likely to continue to pose a significant global health burden in the future. Judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics together with research that improves our understanding of microbial pathogenicity and resistance may help combat such infections and reduce unfavorable outcomes.",
