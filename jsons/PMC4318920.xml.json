No more than 1 subject per day was administered vaccine for the first 3 injections in each group, and safety data through 2 weeks after these injections were reviewed by a protocol safety review team before continuing enrollment of that group.",

Both were manufactured under good manufacturing practice conditions. The MAR vaccine consists of a single, closed, circular plasmid DNA macromolecule (plasmid VRC 6712) designed to express WT GP of the MARV Angola strain (GenBank accession No. DQ447653). The EBO vaccine is composed of 2 plasmids combined in equal concentrations (milligrams per milliliter) in which the amino acid sequences for the GP antigens expressed are identical to WT GP of Ebolavirus. These plasmids are VRC 6611, which expresses the GP gene from the SUDV strain (GenBank accession No. U28134) and VRC 6614, which expresses the GP gene from the EBOV strain (GenBank accession No. U23187). The WT GP inserts were codon modified to optimize antigen expression in human cells [16]. The plasmids in both vaccines are incapable of replication in human cells.",
