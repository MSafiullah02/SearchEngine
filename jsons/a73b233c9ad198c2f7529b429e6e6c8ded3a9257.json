There have no longer cases detected in the world population since 1990, but the question that often arose was: can we destroy the samples of smallpox virus existing in some virology laboratories around the world? [3] . The logical answer is certainly not, because we would lose the capability to prepare vaccine doses without the live virus samples to start from. Needless to say that without a vaccine, a small amount of wild virus could ignite a wide epidemic killing a large portion of the human population, since the vaccination is no longer mandatory in any country and a large percentage of young populations have no longer been vaccinated after the early 1990s.",

Examples in time recall the cases of the highly lethal pandemics known as \"Spanish flu\" in 1917-18 (in excess of 40 million deaths worldwide), \"Asian flu\" in 1956 (in excess of one hundred thousand deaths worldwide) and \"Hong Kong flu\" in 1978 (in excess of seven hundred thousand deaths worldwide). The basic question is: when will the new pandemic strike? Sometimes soon, as international experts say. The so called \"Avian flu\" came close to that, but sometime in the future new mutations may emerge with the potential of being much worse.",
