To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, which binds viral RNA and assembles into a filament that is packaged into new virions. We determined a 1.4 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of this protein's N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer very similar to that of related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Using size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering, we find that this domain forms a dimer in solution, and that addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates tetramer formation. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an \u03b1-helix that either self-associates or docks against the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of over 4,400 individual amino acid substitutions in the N protein from ~17,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and find that they are strongly clustered in the protein's N2a linker domain. The nearly 300 substitutions identified within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and selfassembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. As the N protein is a common target of patient antibodies, this work will also benefit ongoing efforts to develop robust and specific serological tests, and could also benefit the analysis of patient-derived antibodies.",

The virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein is critical for this process, binding the genomic RNA and assembling into large filaments before being packaged into new virions. Here, we sought to understand the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and how it forms large assemblies. We combined x-ray crystallography and two biochemical methods to show that the protein's N2b and N3 domains mediate self-association into dimers and tetramers, respectively. We have therefore outlined the first two steps of a probable three-step selfassembly mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. This work will benefit ongoing efforts to develop robust viral tests and to develop new drugs targeting key steps in the viral life cycle.",

Isolation and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in January 2020, and the virus was found to be highly related to SARS and share a probable origin in bats (2, 6) . Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has infected over 4.6 million people and caused over 312,000 deaths as of May 17, 2020 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the worldwide spread of this ongoing outbreak highlight the urgent need for public health measures and therapeutics to limit new infections. Moreover, the severity of the atypical pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019), often requiring multi-week hospital stays and the use of invasive ventilators (7) (8) (9) , highlights the need for therapeutics to lessen the severity of individual infections.",

The antiviral Remdesivir, first developed against Ebola virus (10, 11) , inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of a range of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 (12) (13) (14) and has shown promise against SARS-CoV-2 in small-scale trials in both primates and humans (15, 16) . Another target is the viral protease (Mpro/3CLpro), which is required to process viral polyproteins into their active forms (17) . Finally, the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein mediates binding to host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) proteins, and mediates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (18) (19) (20) (21) . As the most prominent surface component of the virus, the spike protein is the major target of antibodies in patients, and is the focus of several current efforts at SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. Initial trials using antibody-containing plasma of convalescent COVID-19 patients has also shown promise in lessening the severity of the disease (22) .",

One critical step in coronavirus replication is the assembly of the viral genomic RNA and nucleocapsid (N) protein into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which in betacoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 forms a helical filament structure that is packaged into virions through interactions with the membranespanning membrane (M) protein (23) (24) (25) (26) . Despite its location within the viral particle rather than on its surface, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show higher and earlier antibody responses to the nucleocapsid protein than the surface spike protein (27, 28) . As such, a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein's structure, and structural differences between it and N proteins of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, may aid the development of sensitive and specific immunological tests.",

            "text": "Betacoronavirus Nucleocapsid (N) proteins share a common overall domain structure, with ordered RNA-binding (N1b) and dimerization (N2b) domains separated by short regions with high predicted disorder (N1a, N2a, and spacer B/N3; Figure 1A ). Self-association of the fulllength SARS-CoV N protein and the isolated C-terminal region (domains N2b plus spacer B/N3; residues 210-422) was first demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis (29) , and the purified full-length protein was shown to self-associate into predominantly dimers in solution (30) . The structures of the N2b domain of SARS-CoV and several related coronaviruses confirmed the obligate homodimeric structure of this domain (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) , and other work showed that the region C-terminal to this domain mediates further self-association into tetramer, hexamer, and potentially higher oligomeric forms (38) (39) (40) . Other studies have suggested that the protein's Nterminal region, including the RNA-binding N1b domain, can also self-associate (41, 42) , highlighting the possibility that assembly of full-length N into helical filaments is mediated by cooperative interactions among several interfaces. To characterize the structure and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, we first cloned and purified the protein's N2b dimerization domain (N 2b ; residues 247-364) (43, 44) . We crystallized and determined two high-resolution crystal structures of N 2b ; a 1.45 \u00c5 resolution structure of His 6 -tagged N 2b at pH 8.5, and a 1.42 \u00c5 resolution structure of N 2b after His 6 -tag cleavage, at pH 4.5 (see Methods and Table S1 ). These structures reveal a compact, tightly intertwined dimer with a central four-stranded \u03b2-sheet comprising the bulk of the dimer interface ( Figure 1B) . This interface is composed of two \u03b2-strands and a short \u03b1-helix from each protomer that extend toward the opposite protomer and pack against its hydrophobic core. The asymmetric units of both structures encompass two N 2b dimers, giving four crystallographically independent views of the N 2b dimer. These four dimers differ only slightly, showing overall C\u03b1 r.m.s.d values of 0.15-0.19 \u00c5 and with most variation arising from loop regions ( Figure S1 ). Our structures also overlay closely with another recently-deposited structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N2b domain, which was determined to 2.05 \u00c5 resolution at pH 7.5 (PDB ID 6WJI; Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases (CSGID), unpublished). Including this structure, there are now seven independent crystallographic views of the SARS-CoV-2 N2b domain dimer (14 total protomers) in three crystal forms at pH 4.5, 7.5, and 8.5, all of which overlay with an overall C\u03b1 r.m.s.d of 0.15-0.31 \u00c5 (Figure S1 ). We examined the packing of N 2b dimers in the three different crystal forms, but did not identify any consistent dimerdimer interactions that would suggest independent higher-order assembly of this domain.",

To examine the variability of the N protein in these sequences, we downloaded a comprehensive list of reported mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 N gene in a set of 16,975 genome sequences from the China National Center for Bioinformation, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource. Among these sequences, there are 4,454 instances of amino acid substitutions in the N protein (Figure 2A) . These variants are strongly clustered in the N2a linker domain, particularly in the serine/arginine-rich subdomain (SR in Figure 2A ). The most common substitutions are R203K and G204R, which occur together as the result of a common trinucleotide substitution in genomic positions 28881-28883, from GGG to AAC (~1,500 of the 16,975 sequences in our dataset; Figure S2 ). While positions 203 and 204 accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total individual amino acid substitutions in this dataset, the N2a region shows a strong enrichment of mutations even when these positions are not considered (Figure 2A ). One sequence also showed an in-frame deletion of residues 208-210. In contrast to the enrichment of missense mutations in the N2a domain, synonymous mutations were distributed equally throughout the protein (not shown). Thus, these data suggest that the N2a domain is uniquely tolerant of mutations, in keeping with its likely structural role as a disordered linker between the RNA-binding N1b domain and the N2b dimerization domain.",

We next investigated the molecular basis for higher-order self-assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. Prior work with the Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) N protein showed that this protein's C-terminal N3 domain (residues 409-454 of 454) can, on its own, incorporate into nucleocapsid structures that lack the associated Membrane (M) protein, suggesting that this domain mediates a homotypic interaction between N proteins (44) . Other work with SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E N proteins also found that the region C-terminal to the N2b domain (containing the spacer B and N3 regions) is responsible for higher-order assembly of tetramers and larger oligomers (38) (39) (40) . To test the role of different domains in SARS-CoV-2 N protein assembly, we purified the full-length N protein (N FL ) and a series of truncation constructs encompassing the ordered N1b and N2b domains and their associated linker domains (N1a, N2a, and spacer B/N3; Figure 1A ). We found that N FL formed a large oligomer that eluted in the void volume of a gel filtration column ( Figure 3A ). Despite having been purified in high-salt buffer (500 mM NaCl) and incubated with both DNase and RNase to remove associated nucleic acids, this protein retained significant bound nucleic acid as judged by an A 260 /A 280 ratio of ~1.6 (not shown). Thus, as in related betacoronavirus N proteins, this protein assembles into large oligomers in vitro. Because any associated nucleic acids are likely to be short fragments due to incubation with DNase and RNase, we propose that self-assembly is mediated mainly by protein-protein interactions with at most a minor contribution from bound nucleic acids.",

Unexpectedly, we found that the H-D exchange rates within the N2b domain were nearly identical between the two constructs, varying at most ~1.5% in fractional deuterium uptake in individual peptides (Figure 4B, D) .

Through two high-resolution crystal structures, we show that this protein's N2b domain forms a compact, strand-swapped dimer similar to that of related betacoronaviruses. While the N2b domain mediates dimer formation, we find that addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a robust homotetramer.
