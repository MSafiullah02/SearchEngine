In nineteenth century Europe, childbed fever (puerperal fever) was an important clinical and public health problem, with very high maternal mortality. It was thought to be caused by \u201cmiasma,\u201d epidemicity or by the Will of Providence. Apart from bloodletting, there was no cure for it [2]. Semmelweis cared for these women during their illness, and when they died, he did autopsies on them. He tried to correlate the autopsy findings to clinical symptomatology through secondary data analysis of maternal death records.",

Maternal mortality in the first clinic was unexpectedly higher, 16% compared with 7% in the second clinic. In the first clinic, physicians and medical students started their day by doing autopsies on women who had died on the previous night. From the autopsy room, they proceeded directly to labor room, with no cleaning of their hands, and delivered babies for the rest of the day (surgical gloves were not invented yet; all clinical procedures were done with bare hands). Midwives of the second clinic never conducted autopsies.",

Kolletschka\u2019s autopsy findings were similar to those in childbed fever women. Semmelweis suspected a common link between these deaths. He hypothesized that certain \u201cdeath particles\u201d from body tissues of deceased, stuck to the hands of physicians and medical students during autopsies; their unclean hands carried and transferred these particles to women in labor. Presumably these particles caused childbed fever deaths. Adequate hand washing by physicians and medical students might reduce the transmission of these death particles. He designed and implemented a hand-washing policy for physicians and medical students. Before they entered labor room, they were forced to brush under their fingernails and wash their hands in chlorine water till the skin became dry and cadaveric smell was gone. At the end of 1 year, mortality rate in the first clinic dropped to 2.4%, a rate similar to that seen in the second clinic [4].",

But to Semmelweis\u2019 seniors, this association seemed implausible and incoherent.

Semmelweis published a book \u201cEtiology, the concept, and the prevention of puerperal fever\u201d in 1860, after 13 years of his study. The book had an unwelcome response; it was criticized for poor language and unprofessional writing style. Semmelweis could not tolerate the criticism and suffered with bouts of depression, rage, paranoia, and forgetfulness. He ended up in a mental asylum and died in 1865 [5].",
