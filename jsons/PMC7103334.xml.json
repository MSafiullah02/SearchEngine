The Iridoviridae are large, cytoplasmic DNA viruses with an icosahedral outer capsid, an internal lipid membrane, and an electron-dense core containing a circularly permuted double-stranded DNA genome (209 kbp). CIV infects a wide range of insects (Williams et al., 2005), replicates productively in the cotton boll weevil Anthonomus grandis (Henderson et al., 2001), and induces metamorphic arrest and mortality in this host (McLaughlin et al., 1972). Earlier work showed that UV-treated CIV or viral \u201csoluble\u201d protein extract inhibited host protein synthesis in mosquito cells (Cerutti and Devauchelle, 1980). Recently, our group showed that a CIV virion protein extract (CVPE) induces mortality in neonate boll weevil larvae (Bilimoria, 2001) and apoptosis in spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana and boll weevil cell cultures (Paul et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Apoptosis is generally characterized by several criteria. These include caspase activation, cytoplasmic shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cell blebbing (Hay and Kannourakis, 2002). Apoptosis proceeds through signal transduction pathways, usually involving activation of cysteine-aspartate-specific proteases, i.e., caspases. Various signals activate initiator (apical) caspases, which then trigger effector (executioner) caspases. In Drosophila, one mechanism includes interaction of Eiger (invertebrate tumor necrosis factor ligand) with the wengen membrane receptor. This leads to activation of JNK, which then triggers the central initiator caspase DRONC, instigating a cascade triggering the effector caspase Drice and ultimately apoptosis (Igaki et al., 2002). The Eiger-wengen mediated pathway appears to be the invertebrate equivalent of the \u201cextrinsic\u201d pathway found in mammalian systems. Alternate induction mechanisms in Drosophila include activation of DRONC through ER stress or through bcl-2-type stimulation and could represent invertebrate equivalents of \u201cintrinsic\u201d pathways. Induction of apoptosis in uninfected Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) cells appears to involve the equivalents of mammalian apical caspase and caspase-3 (Manji and Friesen, 2001) as initiator and effector caspases, respectively.",

Fig. 1\nshows that CIVXS induced 70% blebbing (A), whereas CIV induced 10% blebbing and 55% lysis in these cells (B). Lysis was indicated by the presence of cell debris. CIVUV (10 \u03bcg/ml) induced 62% blebbing and 5% lysis in CF cells (C). Mock-treated cells incubated at 21 \u00b0C or 28 \u00b0C did not undergo significant blebbing or lysis (D).

Pancaspase inhibitor reduced blebbing as follows: CIVXS-induced by 93% (Fig. 2A), CIVUV-induced by 97% (Fig. 2B), CVPE-induced by 99% (Fig. 2C). To establish whether the apoptotic pathway in this system requires an apical caspase, CF cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK (a mammalian caspase-8 inhibitor shown to inhibit lepidopteran, Sf-caspase-X) (Manji and Friesen, 2001) prior to challenge with CIVXS, CIVUV or CVPE. The results show that Z-IETD-FMK blocked apoptotic blebbing by at least 97% for CIVXS (Fig. 2A); 96% for CIVUV (Fig. 2B); 96% for CIVUV; and 98% for CVPE (Fig. 2C). Mock treatment with RBSS yielded less than 2% blebbing (Fig 2D). These results suggest that apoptosis induction in CF cells by high-dosage CIV, CVPE, and UV-treated CIV is dependent on Sf-caspase-X-like activity, which we have designated C. fumiferana initiator caspase (Cf-caspase-i).",

Kinase activity has been demonstrated in CIV particles (Monnier and Devauchelle, 1980), and our group recently showed kinase activity in CVPE (Paul et al., 2007). Therefore, interaction of bead-bound CIV with cells was confirmed with kinase assays on whole cells.

The cell lysate was analyzed on SDS\u2013PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. Interaction of CIVUV\u2013bead conjugate with the cell surface was confirmed by the presence of at least one phosphorylated cellular protein. CIVUV\u2013beads in supplemented media devoid of cells did not phosphorylate any polypeptides in the media (data not shown). Similarly, addition of gamma 32P-ATP to cells did not show extracellular kinase activity or blebbing. CIVUV and CIVUV\u2013bead conjugate were added to CF cells, incubated at 21 \u00b0C for 24 h, and assayed for cell blebbing by differentially staining the cells but not beads with Gram's safranin.

Moreover, inhibition of viral protein synthesis enhances CIV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that CIV gene expression is required for suppression of apoptosis. To determine if viral early gene expression blocks apoptosis induction upon CIV infection, we pretreated CF cells with aphidicolin (5 \u03bcg/ml) (D'Costa et al., 2001) or with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA; 200 \u03bcg/ml) prior to infection. Fig. 9\nshows that CIV infection induced only 2% blebbing in the presence of aphidicolin and 1% blebbing with phosphonoacetic acid pretreatment compared to 10% during CIV infections of untreated cells. Thus, blebbing levels are significantly lower under conditions permitting only early gene expression compared to those allowing both early and late gene expression. Late gene expression down regulates many early genes in CIV (D'Costa et al., 2004), which probably leads to the observed 10% enhancement of blebbing. Fig. 9 also shows that inhibition of viral DNA replication in CIV infections where CIVUV or CVPE had been added as apoptosis inducers resulted in similarly drastic reductions in apoptotic blebbing. Cells challenged with CIV and CIVUV together (data not shown) manifested blebbing in 65% of the cell population, probably due to an overwhelming dose of viral proteins. Reciprocal experiments involving CVPE treatment for 1 h followed by CIV and PAA resulted in 40% blebbing and 35% cell lysis, probably due to excessive dose of viral proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that one or more viral early gene products inhibited apoptosis induction by CIV, CVPE, or CIVUV.",

Fig. 10\nshows that significant levels of apical caspase activity were detected in CIV infections with or without inhibition of early gene expression with cycloheximide (CHX-CIV; CIV) and in cells treated with CIV virion protein extract (CVPE). On the other hand, when phosphonoacetic acid restricted viral expression to early genes, CIV infection suppressed Cf-caspase-i activity to mock infection levels (Fig. 10: CIV-PAA). Challenge of CIV-PAA with CVPE did not induce Cf-caspase-i activity (Fig. 10: CIV-PAA-CVPE), indicating strong inhibition of this pathway by viral early gene expression. Cf-caspase-i activity was very low at 3 h post-CIV infection (Fig. 10: CIV-3HPI), which is within the immediate-early phase of the CIV replication cycle (D'Costa et al., 2004). On the other hand, Cf-caspase-i activity 3 h after CVPE treatment was high (Fig 10: CVPE-3HPT). Cf-caspase-i levels at initiation of infection or treatment were at mock infection levels.

Binding of CVPE and CIVUV to polysterene beads did not present steric hindrance problems as determined by the ability of virion-associated kinase activity to phosphorylate at least one cellular polypeptide.

A putative apical caspase designated Sf-caspase-X is inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK in S. frugiperda cells (Manji and Friesen, 2001). Our data show that Z-IETD-FMK also blocks CVPE-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3) and suggest that CVPE-induced apoptosis in C. fumiferana cells is mediated through a putative apical caspase, designated C. fumiferana initiator caspase (Cf-caspase-i). There is some evidence that caspase-8 homologue (DREDD) and FADD homologue (DFADD) detected in Drosophila may be contributing to the apoptotic process in insects (Chen et al., 1998, Hu and Yang, 2000); however, this is not firmly established. On the other hand, it is well established that DRONC plays a central role in Drosophila apoptosis as well as metamorphosis and could well be the common conduit for all caspase-dependent apoptosis in insect systems (Waldhuber et al., 2005, Hay and Guo, 2006). It should also be noted that CVPE as well as CIV induce metamorphic arrest and mortality in the cotton boll weevil (Bilimoria, 2001). Given this and the relationship between the JNK pathway and DRONC in Drosophila, we postulate that Z-IETD-FMK suppresses apoptosis in the CIV-CF cell system by inhibiting putative DRONC-like Cf-caspase-i (Fig. 11).",

CIV virion protein extract (CVPE) and UV-irradiated CIV induced strong apoptosis as observed by blebbing and TUNEL assays, but induction of apoptosis with infectious CIV was muted. Induction by CVPE, CIVUV, or CIV in the presence of CHX suggests that CIV gene expression or DNA replication was not required for apoptosis (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 7). Suppression of apoptosis under conditions that permit early but not late gene expression (Fig. 9) and enhancement of apoptosis under conditions that block early gene expression (Fig. 10) further support these findings. Muted apoptosis with infectious CIV (Fig. 7) may be due to expression of iap-like genes documented in the CIV genome, viz ORF 157L (L), ORF 193R (IDL), ORF 332L (IL), and ORF 284R (L) (Jakob et al., 2001, D'Costa et al., 2004). The first three of these ORFs are similar to iap genes in Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV; (Crook et al., 1993) and have the following motifs, respectively: ring finger, BIR repeat profile, and bipartite nuclear localization signal. ORF 284R is similar to an ASFV gene coding for a polypeptide (p27) with an IAP domain (Chacon et al., 1995) and is expressed exclusively at late times in CIV infections (D'Costa et al., 2004). The temporal status of ORFs 157L, 193R, and 332L are not known, but published data do not preclude an immediate-early status for ORF 193R or ORF 332L (D'Costa et al., 2004). IAP genes, dIAP 1\u20133, are described in Drosophila where they inhibit caspase-9 homologue, DRONC, and Drosophila tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1, dTraf1. Our data do not preclude early expression of a CIV gene product other than iap that inhibits apical caspase activity and either blocks apoptosis or recruits cellular factors for this purpose (Saito et al., 2006).",

However, upon infection with CIV, this response is rapidly and significantly inhibited by viral early gene expression. Excessive viral load overwhelms control mechanisms, resulting in profuse, immediate apoptosis. Fig. 11 depicts a working model incorporating our data. This is the first report showing that endocytosis and JNK-like activity are essential components of the apoptotic pathway in a member of the family Iridoviridae and that apoptosis in this virus group is suppressed by early viral expression. This is also the first report of JNK signal requirement during apoptosis induction by an insect virus.",

Note: processes compromised by addition of inhibitor are indicated in gray. During CIV infection, early gene expression inhibits Cf-caspase-i activity and reduces apoptosis. Blocking early viral expression raises activation of Cf-caspase-i activity and consequent apoptosis. JNK and apical caspase inhibitors each hinder CIV-induced apoptosis in C. fumiferana cells (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4).
