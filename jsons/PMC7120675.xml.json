Some of these \u2018emerging infectious diseases\u2019 are associated with pathogens that have appeared in populations for the first time as a result of cross-species transmission (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus\u2014acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), while others were previously known but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range as a result of underlying epidemiological changes (e.g. multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, dengue, West Nile encephalitis, foot and mouth disease, cassava mosaic disease). The latter include prominent diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and yellow fever that were once on the decline but are now re-emerging.",

In human populations, the majority of disease emergence is driven by ecological factors (Jones et al. 2008; Morens et al. 2004; Taylor et al. 2001; Weiss and McMichael 2004; Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007; Woolhouse 2002; Woolhouse et al. 2005). In particular, anthropogenic factors such as deforestation, habitat fragmentation, urbanisation and modern agricultural practices provide increased opportunities for human interaction with infected reservoirs and vectors, and the existence of rapid global transport networks, and high-density human and animal populations facilitate the spread of pathogens at an unprecedented rate, often over very large distances (Jones et al. 2008; Morens et al. 2004; Taylor et al. 2001; Weiss and McMichael 2004; Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007; Woolhouse 2002; Woolhouse et al. 2005).",

This is considered a consequence of their large population sizes and capacity for rapid evolutionary change (Woolhouse 2002) which together can produce large pools of phenotypic variants including viruses with altered virulence, transmissibility or host range that have increased epidemic potential in their original hosts or are able to jump species boundaries and establish themselves in new hosts. Emergence that leads to successful host switching may be classified into three stages: (1) initial single infection of a new host with no onward transmission (i.e. spillovers into \u2018dead-end\u2019 hosts), (2) spillovers that go on to cause local chains of transmission in the new host population before epidemic fade-out (i.e. outbreaks) and (3) epidemic or sustained endemic host-to-host disease transmission in the new host population (Parrish et al. 2008).",

For the majority of emerging viruses, humans apparently represent dead-end hosts and only a few proceed to stage 3 and beyond to achieve human\u2014human transmission and cause epidemics or sustained endemic transmission (Parrish et al. 2008; Wolfe et al. 2007).

There is no doubt, however, that the latter has opened the floodgates since viral genomes can now be generated at lower cost and much more rapidly than was possible using conventional sequencing approaches. The number of viral genomes available in public databases continues to increase exponentially. This wealth of data has led to significant progress in terms of rapid identification and characterisation of emerging viruses, as well as knowledge about their biodiversity and evolution. In terms of evolutionary biology, the beauty of working in viral genomics lies in the ability to study evolutionary changes on the same time scales as the events that shape them. For several viruses, historical samples are available for retrospective study, and their analysis has contributed to our understanding of viral evolutionary and epidemiological factors/events accompanying their emergence, maintenance and spatial diffusion (reviewed in (Pybus and Rambaut 2009)).",

Although disease emergence in other species can be of equal importance and ultimately impacts on human development, for the purpose of brevity, I concentrate primarily on diseases that have emerged in human populations and draw examples from those that have most deeply affected the developing world. While there is no apparent relationship between the tendency for new human pathogens to be reported and a country\u2019s geographic location or level of development (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007), inadequate public health surveillance and response systems in developing countries coupled with the existence of underlying disease conditions have meant that disease burden is usually greater in developing than developed countries (as well illustrated by the recent H1N1 pandemic, (Archer et al. 2009)). Additionally, prevention and control strategies that are effective in more developed countries often fall short in resource-limited settings, which can then act as pockets of refuge where pathogens persist, and may serve as future source populations for outbreaks in other regions.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that preventing viral disease emergence in human populations begins with a systematic survey of viral diversity in animal populations (Wolfe et al. 2007). Such knowledge would enable identification of animal populations harbouring viruses that have previously infected humans or that are likely to do so by virtue of their relatedness to known human pathogens, or perhaps their ability to infect human cell lines (Holmes and Rambaut 2004). Zoonotic viruses generally cause little or no apparent disease in their original hosts; thus animal reservoirs are often not obvious. Since it is clearly impossible to survey all animal species, the focus of animal surveillance should be on species that are more likely to harbour potentially emergent viruses, for example species with large and/or dense populations, and in particular those that live in close proximity to and are more closely related to humans and their domestic mammals, such as rodents, bats and birds (Holmes and Rambaut 2004). Non-human primate populations (regardless of their size or population density) are also worth surveying because of their close evolutionary relationship with humans and the fact that a number of important human pathogens have emerged from them (e.g. dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV) and HIV). Finally, any other species having direct (e.g. bushmeat, livestock) or indirect contact (e.g. vector-mediated contact) with humans that could have led to human infections in the past should also be included (Wolfe et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Traditional approaches to virus discovery such as electron microscopy, cell culture, animal inoculation studies and serology (Storch 2007) have a number of limitations, the most important being that not all viruses can be cultured in the laboratory (Amann et al. 1995). There are now a range of sensitive molecular approaches to virus discovery that circumvent this problem by relying on detection and characterisation of viral genomes rather than targeting viral particles, antigens or their cytopathic effects (reviewed in Bexfield 2011). These include hybridisation-, PCR- and sequence-based approaches that have varying levels of reliance on sequence information from known pathogens and thus differ in terms of the range of pathogens they would be expected to detect. For example, hybridisation-based techniques (such as microarray (Wang et al. 2002) and subtractive hybridisation (Lisitsyn et al. 1993)) require sequence information from known pathogens to detect related pathogens and are unable to detect completely novel virus families. Likewise, PCR-based approaches using degenerate primers are limited to amplification and detection of related viruses. However, there are also sequence independent PCR approaches that facilitate detection of completely novel pathogens. These include sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA), degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR, random PCR and rolling circle amplification (reviewed in Bexfield 2011). When these approaches are coupled with \u2018next-generation\u2019 sequencing technology (Margulies et al. 2005) such as 454 pyrosequencing (Roche), Illumina (Solexa) and SoLiD\u2122 (Applied Biosystems) for definitive identification of amplified fragments, they very efficiently generate large amounts of sequence data that can then be analysed using bioinformatic tools.",

This approach involves deep sequencing of viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNA) produced by host immune machinery in response to infection. vsiRNAs are produced by cutting up viral genomes, so piecing their sequences together recovers the virus sequence. In addition to being a sequence independent approach, the process is expected to be more efficient since only a small proportion of host small RNAs need to be sequenced and data-mined (Wu et al. 2010). Additionally, since vdSAR assembles viral genomes from the products of an active host immune response to infection, only replicating and infectious viruses that induce the immune response are identified by this approach (Wu et al. 2010).",

In March 2003, traditional cell culture resulted in the isolation of a novel virus from patient specimens (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003). Within days of this, the virus was identified as a coronavirus through the use of a pan viral microarray and confirmed by sequencing using two parallel approaches. The first involved designing primers based on known coronaviruses and amplifying regions of the novel virus, and in the second, viral sequences were directly recovered from the surface of the microarray to which they were hybridised, cloned and sequenced without the need to design specific primers (Wang et al. 2003). Comparison with previously characterised coronavirus strains demonstrated that the virus identified was distinct from all known human pathogens (Wang et al. 2003). Thus within 24 h, an unknown virus was identified as a coronavirus and within days partial genome sequences had been generated. Comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses also played the major role in pinpointing bats as the source of the precursor to the SARS virus and the primary reservoirs for SARS-like coronaviruses (Dominguez et al. 2007; Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008; Lau et al. 2005; Poon et al. 2005; Tang et al. 2006; Tong 2009; Woo et al. 2006; Carrington et al. 2008).",

Researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of high-throughput pyrosequencing for the detection of viruses in human clinical specimens such as stool (Nakamura et al. 2009), nasopharyngeal swabs (Bogaert et al. 2011; Nakamura et al. 2009), autopsy-derived liver and kidney tissues (Palacios et al. 2008) and serum (Briese et al. 2009). This includes identification of novel viruses associated with high mortality outbreaks of unknown aetiology (Briese et al. 2009) and in tissues from individuals who died following organ transplantation from the same donor (Palacios et al. 2008). Others have demonstrated the potential usefulness of metagenomic sequencing in field surveillance for arboviruses by applying the technique to mosquitoes experimentally infected with dengue virus (Bishop-Lilly et al. 2010). It has even been suggested that metagenomic sequencing may be used for continual surveillance of large human populations for known and unknown viral pathogens (Anderson et al. 2003). The suggestion is that large pooled samples of human serum and plasma (possibly discarded specimens from diagnostic laboratories) could be enriched for viral particles and then subjected to metagenomic sequencing on a routine basis. Such large-scale continual surveillance could allow identification of viruses that have entered the human population even before the usual detection thresholds (which would normally depend on several people being infected) have been reached. According to the authors, this approach could be used to \u2018monitor the levels of known viruses, rapidly detect outbreaks and systematically discover novel or variant human viruses\u2019 (Anderson et al. 2003).",

However, in the majority of cases, humans are dead-end hosts or even when they are not, the zoonotic virus cannot be sustained in prolonged transmission chains such that outbreaks are small and die out quickly. The barriers to onward transmission are primarily biological (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007). For example, tissue tropism or viral titres achieved might not allow for efficient human-to-human transmission, or transmission might be restricted by reliance on a vector that does not commonly interact with humans or in which the virus does not achieve high enough titres to efficiently infect humans. In an apparent minority of cases, viruses surmount these barriers and can be maintained in the human population and may even lose their ability to replicate in the animal species they originated from.",

VEEV, an arbovirus belonging to the genus Alphavirus, is usually maintained in an enzootic rodent-mosquito-rodent cycle. An amino acid change (Thr \u2192 Arg) at position 213 in the E2 glycoprotein confers the ability to cause high titre viraemia in horses, whereas the wild type is either unable to replicate in horses or does so at very low titres (Anishchenko et al. 2006). Likewise, the dramatic emergence of the CHIKV (another mosquito-borne alphavirus) in Asia has been linked to a single amino acid change in the envelope 1 glycoprotein (E1-A226V) of the Indian Ocean lineage responsible (de Lamballerie et al. 2008; Hapuarachchi et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2008; Ng et al. 2009c; Sam et al. 2009; Schuffenecker et al. 2006). This change results in increased infectivity and transmissibility by Aedes albopictus (Tsetsarkin et al. 2007; Vazeille et al. 2007), previously considered as only a secondary vector in human-mosquito-human cycles (urban epidemic cycles), which typically involve Ae. aegypti.",

This may be because in both cases, the viruses already had the ability to infect the \u2018new\u2019 host, albeit inefficiently. In the case of viruses entering a new species for the first time, the scenario is expected to be much more complicated. This may be why mutations associated with emergence remain unknown for other zoonoses including intensely studied viruses like HIV. Also, more recent work on CHIKV has shown that the effect of the E1-A226V mutation is lineage specific, working only in the IOL genomic background, with endemic Asian CHIKV strains requiring a second mutation (E1-98T) to become Ae. albopictus adapted (Tsetsarkin et al. 2011).",

The plethora of genomic sequence data being generated and the availability of rapid high-throughput sequencing technology therefore represent valuable resources that have already impacted on the way vaccine and therapeutic development is approached. In particular, they present the opportunity to understand the scope and distribution of the genomic diversity that must be tackled for a given virus and facilitate monitoring of the spatiotemporal dynamics of this biodiversity, thereby underpinning reverse vaccinology, pan-genomic and comparative genomic approaches to identifying vaccine and/or drug targets (Seib et al. 2009) (see Box 7.4).

The current and potential impact of these and other dengue, HIV and influenza sequencing initiatives is well reviewed in Holmes 2009. For dengue, in addition to the previously detailed insights into evolution and epidemiology, analyses suggest that some genotypes differ in virulence and/or fitness (Armstrong and Rico-Hesse 2001; Bennett et al. 2003; Cologna et al. 2005; Cologna and Rico-Hesse 2003; Klungthong et al. 2004; Leitmeyer et al. 1999; Rico-Hesse et al. 1997; Sittisombut et al. 1997; Thu et al. 2004; Wittke et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2005) and that immune-mediated natural selection may determine which genotypes survive (Adams et al. 2006). Thus the fitness of a given genotype may vary with the changing immunological landscape, which has major implications for vaccine development since tetravalent vaccines designed to induce immunity to all four DENV serotypes are unlikely to provide complete cross-protection (Whitehead et al. 2007). For influenza virus, analysis of IGSP data has already altered basic concepts of influenza virus evolution and shed light on the evolution of drug resistance, identified important source and sink populations and provided data on genomic diversity that will improve and accelerate the process of choosing which strains to incorporate into annual vaccines (reviewed in (Holmes 2009)). HIV is perhaps the greatest disappointment in terms of our inability to arrive at a vaccine despite a wealth of genomic data on the virus. In this regard, the major lesson learned from viral genomics is that HIV is immensely diverse both within and between individual hosts (Rambaut et al. 2004) and vaccines are likely to have to be location/population specific and require regular updating (Holmes 2009).",

In addition to enabling rapid responses in terms of development of pathogen-specific screening tests, identification of source populations and disease tracking, this will facilitate generation of hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms and ecological factors underlying the patterns observed. However, despite the immense potential, addressing prevention and control issues of more direct clinical relevance such as the development of vaccines and therapeutics will only be possible if genomic data are accompanied by relevant clinical, immunological, phenotypic, host genomic and epidemiological data, with biological measures from In vitro and in vivo experimental studies incorporated as they arise. The development and maintenance of widely accessible and flexible genomic databases is therefore key in this regard. Furthermore, if we are to avoid the limitations of past efforts, it is essential that data from across the clinical spectrum be included so that the all too common bias towards symptomatic and/or severe cases is avoided. An ideal database would also include viral genomic and corresponding metadata from animal reservoir and/or vector populations, particularly if our goal is to predict future viral emergence. In addition to traditional sources, these data might be derived from programmes and early warning systems such as the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative (http://www.gvfi.org/), USAID PREDICT (http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ohi/predict/index.cfm) and the WHO/FAO/OIE Global Early Warning and Response System (GLEWS; http://www.glews.net/), which focus on identification and control of potentially emergent pathogens through surveillance at the animal\u2013human interface.",

Lines represent MCC phylogeny branches projected on the surface. The uncertainty on the location of raccoon rabies is represented by transparent polygons. These 80% highest posterior density regions are obtained by contouring a time-slice of the posterior phylogeny distribution and imputing the location on each branch in each phylogeny using the precision matrix parameters for the respective sample. The white\u2013red colour gradient informs the relative age of the dispersal pattern (older recent). A green circle marks Pendleton County, WV, where the epizootic\u2019s first case was reported in 1977. The maps are based on satellite pictures made available in Google Earth (http://earth.google.com).
