One is its practical application in clinical settings, including its role in the improvement of existing assays. Since the LAMP method was invented, LAMP reactions for detecting various pathogens were developed by many research groups and their performance observed by comparing to that of existing reagents [such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], as reviewed in the papers [3, 4]. These initial studies can be considered as a sort of validation study to evaluate the feasibility of LAMP technology. After these intensive validation studies, LAMP was actually applied for clinical practice. This review offers an overview of the status of LAMP in terms of its practical applications. The second area is basic research on further simplification of the LAMP assay. Current basic research efforts now focus on testing the distinct features of the LAMP technique owing to its simplicity and rapidity of use. Extensive improvement of LAMP technology is necessary to integrate this method into simple genetic tests to be used as point-of-care diagnostics. Thus, this article also reviews the basic techniques involved in improvement of LAMP technology.",

The new reagent features two improvements. First, the test process has been made faster and simpler; by using the kit named the Loopamp PURE DNA extraction kit (Eiken Chemical) for sputum processing, the NALC (N-acetyl-l-cysteine)-NaOH decontamination step is no longer necessary. Second, TB-LAMP is now provided as a dry reagent, allowing easier storage, that is, it can be stored at room temperature with satisfactory shelf life. Figure 1 shows the operation process of PURE and TB-LAMP. Mitarai et al. [6] reported the results of a clinical trial of PURE-TB-LAMP in Japan, concluding that it is a simple, effective, and rapid test for TB testing and that the sensitivity of TB-LAMP for smear-negative and culture-positive samples is about 55 %. Evaluation studies for the use of this system as a simple TB diagnostics tool suitable for use in resource-limited facilities are currently ongoing in some developing countries.\n",

The malaria LAMP kit (Loopamp MALARIA Pan/Pf detection kit) has been launched as a CE-approved IVD. It consists of two LAMP reagents, one for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and another that reacts with all four types of human malarial parasites. The sensitivity of these reagents is enhanced by targeting of mitochondrial DNA, as demonstrated by Polley et al. [7]. The clinical performance of the kit has been evaluated by the same author and his colleagues [8]. They have demonstrated that the clinical sensitivity and specificity compared with a nested PCR method are 97.0 % and 99.2 % for pan-malaria detection and 98.4 % and 98.1 % for P. falciparum-specific detection, respectively, and concluded that the diagnostic accuracy of the kit is similar to that of nested PCR with greatly reduced time to availability of results. The Loopamp Trypanosoma brucei detection kit has also been developed, acting as a highly sensitive tool for the diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), in which sensitivity is enhanced by targeting of the multicopy gene named RIME (repetitive insertion mobile element) [9]. This reagent kit is currently being clinically evaluated in the HAT endemic countries of Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Uganda, in collaboration with the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) [10]. Furthermore, the application of this kit as an animal test reagent for the diagnosis of surra disease and covering sickness is anticipated, on the basis of its reactivity with Trypanosoma evansi and Trypanosoma equiperdum.",

This kit includes a stool collection brush and a dilution buffer, containing formalin-inactivated Staphylococcus aureus, along with LAMP reagents for the detection phase. The assay allows LAMP amplification of the tcdA gene of C. difficile and a S. aureus gene, as an external quality control, in two reaction chambers using the incubator/turbidity meter named illumipro-10. Lalande et al. demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the illumigene C. difficile kit for the detection of toxigenic strains were comparable to those of the culture method and other PCR-based methods [11]. For example, the sensitivity and specificity of the kit compared to the culture method were 91.8 % and 99.1 %, respectively. This high level of performance, combined with the speed of the process (assay results for a batch of ten stool samples can be obtained within 1 h of testing), led them to conclude that LAMP represents a preferred option for management of the disease.",

For example, the efficacy of LAMP primers developed by Han et al. [12] in the detection and typing of four Plasmodium species has been reported by Sirichaisinthop et al. [13], where it was demonstrated that the Han\u2019s LAMP primers were effective, with sufficient sensitivity, for field use. Use of the LAMP primer set has been recommended by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan in their manual. Similarly, the previously developed LAMP assays for the detection of four serotypes of dengue virus [14], Japanese encephalitis virus [15], and West Nile virus [16] were recently shown to effectively and rapidly detect these viruses in both acute-phase patients and vector mosquitoes in an endemic country [17]. Furthermore, the LAMP primer set for detecting Salmonella species developed by Hara-kudo has been evaluated by Zhang et al., who demonstrated that the LAMP assay using the primer set allowed faster and equally accurate detection of Salmonella species in fresh produce [18]. The performance of the two LAMP primer sets (the RIME-LAMP and SRA-LAMP) for diagnosing HAT, designed by Njiru et al. [9, 19], has been evaluated using clinical specimens collected from patients from endemic countries [20]. They have reported that two LAMP primer sets can detect trypanosomes not only in blood but also in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from a late-stage HAT patient. This finding suggests that these LAMP assays can be used as a routine test for diagnosis and staging of HAT patients.",

Application of LAMP to the world\u2019s three major diseases, that is, TB, malaria, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has also been aggressively advanced since 2009, and more than 40 scientific articles on these diseases have been published. Research has not, however, focused solely on these major diseases. Of the 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) recognized by WHO [21], 14 have been studied using LAMP, these being dengue [14, 22], rabies [23], buruli ulcer [24, 25], leprosy [26], Chagas disease [27, 28], human African trypanosomiasis [29], leishmaniasis [30, 31], cysticercosis [32], echinococcosis [33], foodborne trematode infections [34], lymphatic filariasis [35], schistosomiasis [36], soil-transmitted helminthiases [37], and yaws [38]. The three exceptions are trachoma, onchocerciasis, and dracunculiasis. Because sophisticated facilities and well-trained laboratory technicians are unavailable in most areas in which NTDs are endemic, simple and robust diagnostic tools are in high demand [39]. It is clear that the LAMP assay system represents a promising technology in both the diagnosis and post-elimination surveillance of NTDs. In addition, because many of these diseases are zoonotic vector-borne, LAMP has also been applied to the detection of pathogens in vectors [40] and reservoir animals [41, 42], hinting at the potential for LAMP to be useful in both epidemiological surveillance and control of infection in endemic countries.",

Because LAMP is an isothermal amplification method, LAMP can be performed using an inexpensive heater such as a block heater or water bath, thereby removing the dependence upon stable electricity and allowing for LAMP to be conducted at any time in any setting. LaBarre et al. have recently designed an electricity-free incubation system utilizing a phase-change material and chemically generated heat [43]. When this system was applied to the LAMP technology for detecting malaria parasites, its sensitivity proved to be comparable to that observed with the use of reference heaters (thermal cyclers). Curtis et al. [44] have also developed a similar chemical heater and reported that it could be used for LAMP-based HIV assays with performance comparable to results from similar studies using PCR. Additionally, Hatano et al. [45] successfully detected anthrax by using a disposable pocket warmer and reported that their system has the potential to act as a rapid and reliable test method against anti-bioterrorism. Furthermore, Nkouawa et al. [46] conducted a LAMP assay using hot water kept in a thermos bottle and demonstrated the system to be capable of detecting Taenia tapeworms in human stool samples with performance comparable to that observed with the use of a thermal cycler. The notion of combining these simple heating methods with the so-called \u03bcTAS (micro-total analysis system) format, described below, represents a promising line of research toward the development of a non-instructed nucleic acid test.",

[62] prepared an electrochemical detection device, utilizing the LAMP assay for detecting Escherichia coli, to demonstrate its potential for its clinical application as a simple point-of-care diagnostic device. In addition, Sato et al. reported a method for specifically detecting DNA sequences through the use of an electrochemically active intercalator. This technology has been clinically applied in the detection and typing of HPV, named \u201cClinichip HPV\u201d (Sekisui Medical, Tokyo, Japan) [63]. In the paper, it was demonstrated that the Clinichip test detected 13 individual carcinogenic HPV types with high agreement (96.8\u2013100 %) with the direct-sequencing method. Moreover, because the test procedures are simplified and automated, the Clinichp test has potential to be a simple and useful diagnostic tool for risk evaluation of HPV infection.",

It is also expected that LAMP technology will be applied to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms, relating to drug resistance or side effects, to predict the most effective antimicrobial therapy. Because the number of LAMP-based genetic test reagents currently approved by the certification organization outside Japan remains very small, the practical realization of LAMP technology as a simple and swift genetic test would be in high demand in many countries, especially in most developing countries where many people are facing the threat of a wide variety of infectious diseases.",
