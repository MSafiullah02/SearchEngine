However, it is recently reported that bats are also natural reservoirs or natural hosts of the emerging and re-emerging infectious disease, for examples Nipah virus, Hendra virus and lyssavirus infections including rabies, which lead to serious disorders in humans as well as in some animals [6], [7], [8]. Moreover, bat-SARS-CoV and Ebola virus were also isolated from bats, and the infectious disease derived from bats has been increasing in number [9], [10], [11]. Among these viruses, few investigators reported the result of experimental infection to bats and especially for Ebola virus, it was reported that bats supported the replication and circulation of high titers of this virus without any illness [12]. Many investigators focused on bats from the above-mentioned standpoints, however, most of basic information about their vital functions, such as the specific immune system and others associated with anti-viral activity, has been unclear until now. Therefore, basic researches for immunology in bats are important to advance investigation of the bat-derived infectious diseases.",

The phylogenetic position of Megachiroptera within bats is placed neighboring to Rhinolophoidea [15]. However, it is not clear which species of Megachiroptera is the most close relatives to Microchiroptera, especially for Rhinolophoidea. Thus, we determined the complete mtDNA sequence of Egyptian rousette, Rousettus aegyptiacus, which inhabits from South Africa to Egypt, Pakistan and Cyprus, by the direct and the shotgun sequencing methods. The phylogenic analysis was conducted to decide the position of Egyptian rousette within Chiroptera and among other animals.",

To assess the specificity of the anti-bat IgG antibody, we performed western blot analysis. Only one band with a molecular weight of about 160 kDa was detected in both bat serum and purified bat IgG fraction. These results suggested that the prepared anti-bat IgG antibody had high specificity. To compare the specificity, sera were obtained from four orders, i.e. Primate (one squirrel monkey, two lemurian monkeys and one human), Carnivora (four dogs), Insectivora (five large Japanese moles and four house shrews) and Chiroptera including two Rousettes, one Microchiroptera and three other Megachriopteras. The cross-reactivity of IgG epitopes in each serum sample using anti-bat IgG antibody was determined by the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fetal calf serum (FCS) was used as negative control. As a result, all serum samples obtained from Chiroptera showed high cross-reactivity, over 95% of inhibition, and the cross-reactivity of other animal samples was very low, mostly less than 20% of inhibition. The mean and standard deviation of percent inhibition of sera from Primates, Carnivores, Insectivores and Chiroptera were 15.2\u00b14.6, 12.2\u00b12.8, 8.4\u00b12.2 and 100.9\u00b14.5, respectively.",

When the homology of the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared between the bat CD4 and those of other animals, such as human, mouse, cat, dog and chicken, bat CD4 had a higher homology to both cat and dog CD4 than those of other animals. The phylogenic tree using neighbor-joining method with the amino acid sequence of CD4 showed that bat CD4 was closely related to cat and dog CD4 and was distant from duck and chicken, which agreed with the homology of the nucleotide and the amino acid sequence. This result supported that Chiroptera was included in the same clade including cat, dog, pig and whale [45], [46]. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the CD4 Ig-like C-type 1 domain was compared between bat and other animals. In bat CD4, there was an insertion of 18 extra amino acids in the beginning of this domain, where dog and cat CD4 have 9 and 16 amino acids insertions, respectively, provided CD4 of human and mouse being as a standard. The insertion might influence the relationship between V-type domain and C-type 1 domain. In the N-terminus side, cystein pair might be lost because one cystein was replaced by tryptophan in the bat CD4, whereas in the case of human, monkey and mouse CD4 it was still cystein. The latter animals might have a disulfide bond formed by the two cysteins in this region. However, bat CD4 lacked the disulfide bond, as in cat, dog and whale. As a result the conformation of bat CD4 Ig-like C-type 1 region might be different from that of the human and mouse (Fig. 3\n). The conformational change of the bat CD4 might influence the antigen presentation process between APC and helper T cells by means of CD4\u2013MHC classII connection [47], [48].",

Cells make use of two signal transduction pathways to express type-I IFN genes, the classical pathway and the new IFN induction pathway. In the first case, the intracellular sensors detect viral components in the cytoplasm and activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and NF-\u03baB which transactivate IFN-\u03b2 gene [56]. Synthesized IFN-\u03b2 secretes and binds to type-I IFNAR. Viral dsRNA activates this signal through Toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3), RIG-I and MDA5. In the case of latter, cells recognize viral materials with TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 expressed on the cell surface or in endosomes. TLR7 and 8 recognize viral single-stranded RNA, and TLR9 recognizes double-stranded CpG-rich DNA [57]. TLR signaling activates IRF-7 and regulates multiple IFN-\u03b1 and single \u03b2 gene expression [58]. Synthesized type-I IFNs bind to IFNAR and activate the expression of numerous ISGs, such as the PKR, the OAS and the Mx, through JAK-STAT signaling pathway [50]. These products control viral infection, for examples PKR inhibits the viral protein translation, OAS degrades cellular and viral RNA and Mx sequesters viral ribonucleoproteins to specific subcellular compartments.",

We used the supernatant of BPKC treated with poly(I:C) as bat type-I IFN-including medium. Briefly, poly(I:C) exposure was conducted in BPKC with DEAE-dextran for 3 h. After that, culture medium was removed and the cells were washed by PBS and then cultured for 24 h with new 5% FCS medium. The whole supernatant was collected and used as bat type-I IFN-including medium (conditioned medium). In the case of BPKC, IFN-\u03b1 mRNA expression was detected at every time and increased gradually, while IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression was detected at 4 and 8 h and peak at 4 h. However, Tb-1 Lu did express neither IFN-\u03b1 nor \u03b2 mRNA at any time. It indicated that the reaction of IFN-\u03b2 was sooner for a reaction to virus or microbes as soon as possible and that of IFN-\u03b1 was longer for the expression of antiviral activity proteins, including the PKR, OAS and Mx protein, for long time. Meanwhile, when Tb-1 Lu were treated with poly(I:C) and the conditioned medium, these cells did not express type-I IFNs mRNA at any time. From these results, we suggested that the mechanism from the recognition of poly(I:C) through TLR3 or bat IFNs through IFNAR to the expression of type-I IFNs was not working right in Tb-1 Lu cell line, whereas BPKC did work. Therefore, it might be better to use primary cell culture than using an established cell line to evaluate host response to virus or microbes.",

During the past decade, bats have been associated with a number of emerging zoonotic agents, including Hendra, Nipah, Lyssa, Ebola and SARS coronavirus-like viruses. Therefore, bats are thought to be an important reservoir of many mammalian viruses. Serological surveys of viruses that infected bats have been already reported. Most of the surveys were conducted by using neutralization test (NT) or fluorescent antibody tests [9], [11], [61], [62], [63], [64]. However, it is not easy to obtain the sufficient amount of blood samples to perform these tests, because of the size of bats, particularly in Microchiroptera (microbats). Moreover, these assays are not so suitable for testing a large number of samples at the same time. For these points of view, ELISA is a powerful tool for the serological survey viruses that infect bats. However, there are no conventional ELISA systems, except the systems using protein G or competitive techniques with monoclonal antibodies [65], [66], [67], [68].",

YOKV belongs to Entebbe bat virus group, the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and was isolated from a bat in Oita Prefecture in Japan in 1971 [70]. Before the virus was isolated, attempts were done to isolate JEV from bats by Oya et al., to investigate the possibility that bats served as a reservoir for JEV in winter period.

In this survey, 2.7% of the samples collected from the Philippines and 19% from Malaysia showed detectable levels of antibodies. Serum samples were also tested by NT, and the correlation rate between ELISA and NT was 0.79. These data suggest that YOKV is distributed not only in Japan but also in other Asian countries. However, the antibody titer against YOKV was not so high in this survey. And, it is known that antibodies against flaviviruses show cross-reactivity with other flaviviral antigens [68]. Therefore, to examine the specificity of ELISA, ELISA substituting the antigen to JEV, which was widely distributed in South-East Asian countries, was conducted. Although ELISA with JEV antigen reacted with the positive serum against YOKV, the ELISA titer was much lower than homologous titer with YOKV antigen. These results suggest that this conventional ELISA system is useful to detect the specific YOKV antibody in bat sera. The method is so simple, and easy to establish without obtaining specific antibodies against target virus. This system has a possibility to be applied to other viruses by substituting only the coating virus antigen.",

They concluded that YOKV is genetically closer to yellow fever virus than JEV, and is more closely related to the partially reported amino acid sequences of Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus and Sepik virus. Previous phylogenenic analysis of the genus Flavivirus revealed that flaviviruses could be divided into three groups: mosquito-borne, tick-borne, and unknown vector groups [74], [75]. Tajima et al. indicated that YOKV would belong to mosquito-borne group, although YOKV is classified in the Entebbe bat virus group of vector unknown group. Previous report indicated that Entebbe bat and Sokluk viruses could replicate in mosquito cells in vitro [76]. These findings may suggest that YOKV as well as Entebbe bat virus and Sokluk virus is related to mosquito-borne flaviviruses. These facts might suggest that the fruits bats, which showed ELISA antibodies, were infected by mosquitoes.
