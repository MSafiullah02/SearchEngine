            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious disease, caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), that affects poultry production worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007). IBV belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus, subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (Cook et al., 2012). The IBV genome is approximately 27.6 kb in size. All coronaviruses share a similar genome organization with gene 1, the replicase gene, located at the 5\u02b9 end of the genome and the structural and accessory genes clustered at the 3\u02b9 end, which produce the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. IBV also possesses two accessory genes, gene 3 and gene 5, and the recently characterized inter region (IR), all of which have been shown to be dispensable for virus replication in cell culture (Bentley et al., 2013; Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The main method of protecting chickens from infectious bronchitis is inoculation with attenuated live vaccines. Commercial infectious bronchitis vaccines are usually developed by multiple passages of a virulent field isolate in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs until the desired non-pathogenicity and immunogenicity have been achieved (Bande et al., 2015). However, the mutations associated with attenuation of the pathogenicity in chickens remain unknown and are variable leading to the differing efficacies associated with different vaccines. Comparison of the genome sequences of virulent and attenuated avian IBV strain Ark DPI viruses revealed that these viruses are similar and differ only by 21 nucleotides, resulting in 17 amino acids changes. Most of these substitutions were located in the replicase 1a and spike genes (Ammayappan et al., 2009). Philips et al. analyzed the consensus full-length genome sequences of three different IBV serotypes (Ark, GA98, and Mass41) and showed that passage in embryonated eggs, to attenuate the viruses in chickens, resulted in amino acid changes, of which 34.75%\u201343.66% of all of these amino acid changes occurred in the protein encoded by the nsp 3 gene within a virus type, suggesting the potential role of nsp 3 in the attenuation procedure (Phillips et al., 2012). Huo et al. found that the replicase 1a sequence was truncated by 30 bp in the same region of the gene in all of the passaged viruses (Huo et al., 2016). However, due to the lack of a suitable reverse genetic system for virulent IBV, there is no clear confirmation of the specific gene locus that is directly associated with the attenuation of IBV.",

In brief, the obtained positive plasmids, pGPT-S-positive and pGPT-5a-positive, were integrated into the vaccinia virus genome by homologous recombination under the positive selection pressure of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine, to which only recombinant vaccinia viruses with the Ecogpt gene show resistance (Falkner and Moss, 1990). Ecogpt-selected viruses were purified and sequenced to ensure that IBV segment S and 5a has been replaced by the Ecogpt gene in the vaccinia genome respectively. After that, the verified viruses were reconstructed with the obtained negative plasmids, pGPT-S- negative and pGPT-5a-negative, by exerting negative selection pressure on D980R cells due to the presence of 6-thioguanine (Hertzig et al., 2004). IBV full-length RNA transcript was generated in vitro using purified genomic DNA isolated from recombinant vaccinia virus containing the 27.9-kb full-length IBV cDNA, that was digested with NotI and in vitro transcribed by the RiboMAX\u2122 Large Scale RNA Production System--T7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

After 48 h, the virus-containing medium was collected and inoculated into six 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). After incubation in ECE at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h, allantoic fluid from ECE was harvested for further RT-PCR detection and sequencing.

No mutations were found in the 3a, 3b, E, and 5b genes. The nt mutations and deletions are shown in Table 1.

Each rescued rIBV was subsequently passaged to P10 in ECEs for further analysis. The successful rescue of infectious rIBVs was confirmed by IBV-induced embryo curling or death within 144 hpi. The time to death was longer for all recombinant rIBVs than for the wild-type YN. Most embryos died within 72 hpi with wild-type rYN, whereas embryos inoculated with rYN-S-aYN or rYN-5a-aYN mostly survived past 96 hpi.

These results suggested that the replacement or deletion of gene 5a had a minor detrimental effect on virus replication in CEK cells. The replication pattern of the two recombinant strains in ECEs was also slightly different to that of the parental IBV strain rYN. At 24 hpi both recombinant strains showed 0.5\u20131.5 log10 higher copy number than the wild-type rYN strain.

It replicates primarily in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract causing infectious bronchitis, which is characterized by nasal discharge, snicking, tracheal ciliostasis, and rales in chickens, but is also able to replicate in the epithelial cells of other organs such as the enteric tract, oviducts, and kidneys (Ambali and Jones, 1990; Chen and Itakura, 1996; Maiti et al., 1985). Despite vaccination using both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, avian IBV is responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide as a result of poor weight gain and decreased egg production. The absence of vaccine cross-protection and the frequent emergence of new variant strains complicate the control of IBV (de Wit et al., 2011; Muneer et al., 1987).",

As a consequence of this process, the virus becomes more adapted to the embryo, reflected by more efficient replication and higher pathogenicity for the embryo, with concomitant attenuation in chickens and in some cases loss of immunogenicity. However, the mutations associated with attenuation of pathogenicity in chickens are unknown and variable, leading to the differing efficacies associated with different vaccines. Thus, a new generation of vaccines is needed in which the IBV genome could be precisely modified using reverse genetics.",

Using this system, Casais et al. found that spike protein is a determinant of cell tropism. They constructed a recombinant avian IBV expressing a heterologous spike gene and found that it acquired the same cell tropism phenotype as the donor strain in four different cell types. Hodgson et al. constructed a recombinant IBV strain Beaudette with the S gene of pathogenic M41 strain, and the rIBV remained attenuated but induced protective immunity against strain M41 (Hodgson et al., 2004). Armesto et al. also used the IBV Beaudette strain as a backbone and constructed a recombinant virus containing the replicase gene from strain M41; however, virulence was not restored in this recombinant virus (Armesto et al., 2009; Keep et al., 2018). Shan et al. constructed seven recombinant strains by separately or simultaneously replacing the three hypervariable regions of the S gene of strain Beaudette with the corresponding fragments from a QX-like nephropathogenic isolate. None of these rIBVs showed a significant increase in pathogenicity compared with the Beaudette strain in SPF chickens (Shan et al., 2018). The results presented above were all based on the avirulent Beaudette strain, which may not be an ideal background in which to study the role of IBV-specific mutations in pathogenicity.",

We compared the complete genome sequences of these two strains and found mutations and deletions distributed across the whole genome. Among these mutations, a mutation cluster region including the introduction of a premature termination codon within the S protein and a serial 81-nt deletion in the 5a accessory gene were most likely to affect the pathogenicity of IBV strain YN. The mutations in the S gene mostly existed in the region from 1 to 400 nt at the start of the S1 gene. This region includes three characterized hypervariable regions possessing high genetic variability that are responsible for the induction of neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies (Cavanagh et al., 1988; Moore et al., 1997). The role of accessory genes in the attenuation of coronavirus has drawn the attention of researchers in recent years, and the group-specific genes have been proven to have a function in attenuation in natural hosts (Haijema et al., 2004; de Haan et al., 2002; Laconi et al., 2018). To identify the viral components critical for efficient replication and pathogenicity of gamma coronaviruses, in this study, we used an IBV reverse genetics system based on virulent strain YN of IBV to generate rIBVs in which the S gene or ORF 5a of the YN genome were replaced with the corresponding regions from attenuated YN strain aYN. Successfully rescued viruses were characterized and subsequently investigated for pathogenicity and virulence in ovo and in vivo.",

According to previous research, IBV accessory proteins are not essential for viral replication in CEK cells or ECEs (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006), thus we could conclude that the attenuated phenotype (low embryo mortality and curling rate) of the recombinant virus in ECEs is not due to replication deficiency, but because of the decreased virulence of recombinant virus.",

Gross lesions in the lung and kidney were also negligible, but trachea lesions could still be observed in the rYN-S-aYN and rYN-5a-aYN challenged group. According to histopathological examination, moderate epithelium damage and cilia-shedding were observed in the trachea of the rYN-S-aYN or rYN-5a-aYN challenged groups. The ciliary activity of the rYN-S-aYN or rYN-5a-aYN challenged groups recovered faster than that of the wild-type rYN infected group. Furthermore, the viral loads in the trachea were significantly lower at 5 and 7 dpc. As the primary target organ during IBV infection, the trachea is the most sensitive to IBV infection, followed by the kidney and lung. As demonstrated by previous research, trachea cultures were found to be as sensitive as 9-day-old embryonated eggs in detecting IBV either in pathological material or in serial dilutions (Cook et al., 1976). This may explain the fact that even when the recombinant virus load decreased significantly in the trachea, damage to this organ still occurred and the ciliary activity has not restored in the rYN-S-aYN or rYN-5a-aYN challenged groups. The virus copy numbers and the damage in the lung and kidney of rYN-S-aYN or rYN-5a-aYN challenged groups provided evidence of the reduced pathogenicity of the recombinant viruses.",

Score of 0: the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed movement; score of 1: 75\u2013100% cilia of the tracheal section showed movement; score of 2: 50\u201375% cilia of the trachea showed movement; score of 3: 25\u201350% cilia of the trachea section showed movement; score of 4: less than 25% cilia of the trachea section showed movement or no movement at all. For each group, the average ciliostasis score was calculated. Viral load qPCR data comes from 2 euthanized bird at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 dpc from each group, includes three technical replicates/animal. Data were statistically evaluated by two-way ANOVA test adjusted for post-hoc analysis, followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests. Statistical significance was considered as follows: significant at p < 0.05 (*), highly significant at p < 0.01 (**), and very highly significant at p < 0.001 (***).",
