Participants will be randomised to either the Supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) intervention or control. The SPHERe intervention consists of 1) individual assessment and familiarisation sessions; 2) 8-week, twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; 3) psychosocial/motivational support and education; 4) guided home exercise plan. The control intervention consists of best practice usual care with a single one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the incremental shuttle walk test at 4 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL), time to clinical worsening and health and social care use. A purposive sample of participants (n = 20 intervention and n = 20 control) and practitioners (n = 20) will be interviewed to explore experiences of the trial, outcomes and interventions.",

However, exercise rehabilitation has not been tested in those with the most common forms of PH (groups 2 & 3) , or in an out-patient setting in the UK [6, 7, 10] . For people living with chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), without coexisting PH, exercise rehabilitation is recommended by NICE [11] , and the British Thoracic Society [12] , supported by a considerable evidence base [13] . Exercise rehabilitation can improve fitness in these populations, and increase ability to 'self-manage', often reducing health and care utilisation [13, 14] . Thus, it is plausible, that exercise may also help people in other PH groups with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [7, 15] .",

Adequate warm-up and cool-down will be incorporated. Intensity will be monitored and adjusted using heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, dyspnoea scale [26] and pulse oximetry (O 2 saturation). The SPHERe exercise component is optimised to be appropriate for a broad spectrum of patients including deconditioned, low-mobility, exercise-naive participants. It is highly adaptable to allow personalisation to lower or higher ability participants, whilst ensuring safety and efficacy. The SPHERe exercise intervention combines conventional gym-based aerobic exercise with 'functional fitness training'. This uses multi-plane motion to target not only cardiorespiratory fitness, but also essential prerequisites of active, independent living; e.g. agility, co-ordination, proprioception, balance and functional strength [27] . In addition to treadmills, cycle and rowing ergometers, SPHERe will make use of low-cost, readily available, functional fitness equipment; e.g. steps, floor agility ladder, low rise balance beam, power bags, plyometric boxes, ball (throw/bounce) etc. Central to SPHERe is the expertise and experience of the specialist cardio-pulmonary exercise physiologists and physiotherapist at all trial centres who will ensure holistic, safe, individualised and effective exercise training.

The ICC is an overall estimation of the site and practitioner effect, leading to an estimated design effect of 1.33, although a negligible practitioner effect in this trial is anticipated. Accordingly, the group sample sizes were calculated separately, given the power of 90% and a significance level of 5%. An 80% retention rate is expected at 4 months.

Intervention costing will reflect the structure within which care is being given and will, by necessity, balance precision with practicality.

These health state values will be used to estimate QALYs at the patient level, over 1 year, using the trapezoidal rule. The EQ-5D-5 L will be used as the overall HRQoL outcome due to specific concerns about the sensitivity to change of other measures such as the SF-36, in this population. The EQ-5D-5 L is likely to be more responsive to change than the 3 L, and hence is preferred as a clinical outcome. Significant adverse events will be captured summatively in the HRQoL estimation.
