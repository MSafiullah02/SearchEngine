Additionally, because the chronic hepatitis C burden is large and conducting follow-up investigation can be labor intensive, some countries and local areas might lack the capacity to investigate and confirm cases. Despite the challenges of conducting hepatitis C surveillance, there is hope for hepatitis C eradication because primary prevention is effective, and secondary transmission and complications are preventable through case management, new effective treatments, and alcohol counseling. Surveillance data are essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs and policies [3].",

When symptoms are present, they can include jaundice, fever, abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, fatigue, joint pain, loss of appetite, and clay-colored stools [6]. For symptomatic HCV-infected individuals, the onset of symptoms usually occurs 6\u20137 weeks after exposure [7, 8]. For asymptomatic HCV-infected individuals, diagnosis usually occurs incidentally during blood donation screenings and other medical screenings. In the USA, federally supported surveillance captures only a fraction of all acute HCV infections because the identification of acute HCV infection requires the presence of symptoms [9], and the proportion of those with symptoms is relatively small (20\u201330 %) [6]. However, procedures have been developed that account for asymptomatic HCV infections in estimating the total number of reported acute cases (estimation procedures are discussed in Sect. 5.5). Table 6.1 describes the general characteristics of acute and chronic HCV infection.\n",

In Egypt, for example, 15 % of persons aged 15\u201359 years had evidence of past/present HCV infection [11]. In comparison, more developed countries, such as those in North America, northern and western Europe, and Australia, have a low to moderate reported prevalence (<3.5 %) (Fig. 6.1). In the USA, for example, the estimated prevalence of HCV infection is approximately 1.0 %, or 2.7 million persons [12]\u2014disproportionately affecting persons who are middle aged [1, 12, 13]. Hepatitis C has at least six distinct genotypes widely distributed across the globe. In the USA, Europe, and Japan, genotypes 1a and 1b are most predominant although genotypes 2a and 2b are also common [14]. Genotype 2c is prevalent in northern Italy while genotype 3a is prevalent among intravenous drug users in Europe and the USA [14]. In North Africa and the Middle East, genotype 4 is predominant while genotypes 5 and 6 are confined to South Africa and Hong Kong [14].\n",

In developed countries like the USA, the risk of HCV transmission in healthcare settings has dramatically declined due to the implementation of safe injection and universal infection control practices [20]. Despite the decline, from 2008 to 2012, 16 healthcare-associated hepatitis C outbreaks that resulted in 160 cases of HCV infection were reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [21]. Healthcare-associated hepatitis C outbreaks are indicators of failure to implement and strictly adhere to standard precautions and infection control measures. Since the development of the hepatitis C antibody screening test in 1990 and screening of the blood supply for hepatitis C in 1992, HCV transmission from blood transfusions has been greatly reduced in developed countries [22]. In developing countries, this mode of transmission remains significant [22, 23].",

The initial test is for HCV antibodies, which are detectable approximately 4\u201310 weeks after exposure [39]. In symptomatic cases, this time period usually occurs at or before the onset of clinical symptoms. The HCV antibody test is positive in acute, chronic, and resolved infections (Table 6.2). Consequently, HCV antibody tests do not have the capacity to distinguish current infection from past, resolved infection [40]. In addition to standard serologic assays, there are also rapid tests to detect HCV antibodies [41]. The availability of standard and rapid assays varies significantly and is dependent on availability of resources [40]. Over the past decade, new generations of standard tests with high sensitivity and specificity have been developed [40, 42]. However, the proportion of false-positive HCV antibody results is inversely related to the HCV prevalence in that setting [40, 43]. False-negative HCV antibody results also occur, particularly in individuals with severe immunodeficiency [39, 44], but rarely among the general population.\n",

There are a number of qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA assays [43]. However, these tests are expensive and not widely available. Further, because these tests detect HCV RNA, they are important for differentiating current infection from past, resolved infection [45]. Therefore, both in the clinical practice and in epidemiologic studies, it is important to follow up on every HCV antibody-positive result with an RNA assay [43]. In conditions where the HCV antibody test is likely a false negative, RNA testing may provide the correct diagnosis [43]. For these reasons, quantitative HCV RNA assays and genotype studies are important in the clinical management of chronic HCV infection.",

However, if the objective is to obtain data for case management and evaluation of local area prevention programs, then individual cases should be monitored and records updated over time [61]. Furthermore, the population for which information is needed is an important determinant of surveillance methods. For example, in an enhanced surveillance pilot study in select neighborhoods in England, there were concerns about increases in HCV infection among MSM. Health officials quickly recruited and collected information from certain drug treatment facilities and implemented a surveillance project that provided results that were applied and published in less than a year [62]. In another study, researchers sought to determine which hepatitis C genotypes were circulating among injection drug users in Hungary [63]. They approached needle exchange programs and drug treatment facilities in all health districts and found that HCV strains among injection drug users were very different compared to HCV-infected persons who did not acquire their infections from injecting drugs [63]. The objectives and expected use of the surveillance data also should be tempered with the resources available to conduct the activities.",

Registration of death, using a death certificate, is legally required in the USA. As a result, virtually all deaths are included in the registries. Cause of death listed on the death certificate is dependent on the presence/absence of a physician or family member who is knowledgeable about the health of the deceased, severity of disease, complexity of the disease, associated illnesses, and whether or not an autopsy or diagnostic laboratory testing was performed.Death certificates are completed by funeral directors based on information from attending physicians, medical examiners, coroners, and family members. Death certificates are filed in vital statistics offices within each state and the District of Columbia. States share information from death certificates with CDC through the National Vital Statistics System, which then produces public-use mortality files containing death information with cause of death coded in accordance with the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision [70]. These data are used to determine the national burden of mortality associated with specific diseases, including viral hepatitis. A recent analyses of these mortality data from 1999 through 2007 indicated that the hepatitis C mortality rate exceeded the HIV mortality rate in 2007 [32].\nSurveys: Health surveys are used for a variety of reasons, including augmenting our understanding of viral hepatitis from surveillance. Currently, the CDC uses several national surveys, which may include seroprevalence data, to describe and understand hepatitis C-related prevalence, hospitalizations, treatments, and development of CLD. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has provided valuable seroprevalence data on hepatitis A [71], hepatitis B [72], and hepatitis C [12] that are representative of the US noninstitutionalized civilian population [73]. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey use a national sample of visits from nonfederal employed office-based physicians who provide direct patient care and from emergency departments and outpatient department of noninstitutional general and short-stay hospitals, respectively, to obtain information about the use and provision of ambulatory medical care services, including viral hepatitis-related visits [74], in these settings. The National Hospital Discharge Survey was a nationally representative survey conducted from 1965-2010 that provided information from patients of non-federal, short-stay hospitals in the USA about the characteristics of these patients, conditions for which they were treated, cost of treatment, and a number of other public health topics of interest. The National Hospital Care Survey is a new survey which links the inpatient data that was collected by the National Hospital Discharge Survey with the emergency department, outpatient department, and ambulatory surgery center data collected by the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Together, these population-based surveys provide a wealth of readily available data that are already in electronic format. As a result, they can be relatively inexpensive sources of useful information in addition to that obtained from surveillance.\n",

In general, at the national level, surveillance data are used to understand the burden of disease, inform local partners of disease clusters or outbreaks within and across jurisdictions, identify high-risk populations, and inform, prioritize, and evaluate prevention activities. At the local level, surveillance data are used to identify the most likely mode of transmission in the community to limit further transmission, detect and control local outbreaks, improve outreach services, and provide appropriate case management including screening and linking infected persons into care and counseling. Additionally, hepatitis C surveillance data can be matched with other disease registries, such as HIV, in order to integrate medical services for each individual and further understand disease burden. Surveillance data can also be used to evaluate the quality of care, including implementation of hepatitis A and B vaccine recommendations, among HCV-infected patients. Hepatitis A and B vaccine history can be obtained through follow-up investigation of cases and can be used to improve vaccine coverage rates.",

In the USA, CDC estimates that for every reported case of acute hepatitis C, another 12 infections go unreported [80]. There are many reasons why hepatitis C is underreported in the USA. First, HCV infections can only be considered acute if symptoms are present or there is a documented seroconversion. However, 70\u201385 % of HCV-infected individuals are asymptomatic; about one-half are unaware of their infection [84]. Second, a large percentage of HCV-infected persons may lack access to healthcare services and are thus not reported to health departments. In addition, many states lack the funding needed to conduct enhanced surveillance and do not have the capacity to develop a surveillance system capable of receiving and processing the large number of positive HCV antibody laboratory reports. The number of hepatitis C cases annually reported to health departments often outpaces the amount of resources on hand to fully conduct follow-up investigations to determine if the newly reported case is acute. For these reasons, identifying hepatitis C cases is challenging.",

The inability to depend solely on serologic testing to identify acute hepatitis C cases combined with the inability to fully investigate all newly reported cases often leads to the inability to determine if hepatitis C cases are confirmed; these cases instead have a case status label of \u201cprobable,\u201d \u201csuspect,\u201d or \u201cunknown.\u201d Unconfirmed cases may never be tested or investigated to determine if they are currently infected [85].

However, because laboratories lack a standardized system and health departments vary in their capacity to receive and process electronic information, the large number of hepatitis C reports easily overwhelmed their systems. The lesson learned was that health departments needed to invest in electronic data systems that allowed significant numbers of test results to be received, de-duplicated to result in patient-level information, and then processed to determine electronically whether the patient had been reported previously or was a new case [100].\nFunding for staff at health departments to conduct follow-up investigation. Because of limited human resources, it became clear that attempting to follow-up on all de-duplicated cases was not feasible. The solution to this problem was to conduct follow-up investigation on a random sample of cases. In most sites, sampling was conducted prospectively on recently reported cases, allowing a 3-month waiting period to ensure that providers had notified patients of their test results. The goal in most sites was to sample \u226510 % of reported cases and to obtain supplemental information from the healthcare provider associated with the positive test result.\nFlexibility of data collection instruments and data entry and storage systems. Previously, information on mode of transmission was considered desirable, but more helpful to prevention was the identification of which individuals were linked to care. Several health departments had the flexibility to pilot new information items including whether the individual had seen a healthcare provider for hepatitis-related care, and whether they had ever been treated for hepatitis C.\nSecure and standardized transmission of data to a central office. Difficulties with the larger electronic system for notifiable diseases resulted in the use of an independent, secure transfer protocol mechanism to receive electronic data from sites.\nCapacity to conduct analyses at the central office. The application of standardized case definitions was complicated at the local level by subjective interpretations and applications of the definition. Data collected on all positive HCV antibody tests allows surveillance programs to understand the population testing positive, and not only those who have the additional confirmatory testing requirements to meet the case definition (e.g., RIBA, RNA). Therefore, a best practice is to receive all data elements and observations health departments are able to collect and send them to a central office. Then, standardized selection criteria can be applied prior to data analyses. For example, the current US hepatitis C case definition requires a confirmatory antibody test; however, understanding the frequency with which persons test positive and are then not reported to have a follow-up test is useful for prevention [85].\n",

However, careful consideration of objectives should be balanced with available resources. The current US hepatitis C surveillance system forms the backbone of surveillance and provides incidence data. Enhanced surveillance activities provide additional risk and exposure information on cases. To describe the complete spectrum of HCV disease, HCV-related information from additional sources of data, including population-based surveys, is used. As healthcare services evolve in their application of informatics, surveillance of HCV infection can take advantage of the events generated from HCV-related medical encounters in electronic medical records. Testing data from laboratories could be used to monitor the implementation of screening recommendations, and results from nucleic acid tests could be useful to distinguish between current present and resolved or past HCV infection.",
