            "text": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically transformed HIV infection from a death sentence to a clinically manageable chronic disease. Strict adherence to ART effectively suppresses viraemia, halts progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), thwarts HIV acquisition when used as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis, and prevents transmission 1 . However, limitations in medication access and adherence, together with emerging drug resistance, remain major obstacles to ending the epidemic with ART alone 2 . Moreover, the risks of disease progression and virus transmission rapidly re-emerge in the vast majority of individuals upon cessation of ART due to rebound from viral reservoirs that persist during treatment 3 , necessitating lifelong ART administration. These key limitations compel refocused efforts towards understanding the determinants of HIV immune control, and the failure of such control, in order to inform the development of preventive and therapeutic vaccine strategies.",

            "text": "A central challenge to immune containment and vaccine development is that HIV is among the most diverse and rapidly evolving human pathogens ever encountered. For perspective, a snapshot of HIV sequence diversity within a single individual is comparable to the global diversity of influenza virus over an entire year 4 . Perhaps unsurprisingly in light of such variation, vaccine strategies to date have failed to provide adequate protection from HIV infection [5] [6] [7] , and the path forwards to an effective neutralizing antibody-based vaccine remains uncertain. Considering the formidable challenges associated with a preventive vaccine, it is perhaps even more difficult to imagine immune-based elimination of HIV infection, which, in addition to combating viral diversity, would also need to eradicate persistent viral reservoirs. Indeed, the only two examples of apparent HIV reservoir clearance have been mediated not by immunological or pharmacological interventions but rather by HIV-resistant haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 8,9 . In contrast to these cases of transplant-induced elimination of infection, approximately 1 in 300 infected individuals is able to maintain viraemia below thresholds associated with transmission and disease progression without the need for ART 10 . An extensive body of evidence indicates that this durable control is mediated not by antibodies but by effective HIV-specific CD8 + T cells. Given documented cases of spontaneous viral control for decades, such untreated HIV controllers represent a viable model for an effective vaccine and durable immune-mediated HIV remission. In this Review, we synthesize evidence that supports a translatable CD8 + T cell-mediated mechanism of durable HIV control, highlighting preclinical evidence suggesting that vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8 + T cells are able to limit both the transmission and establishment of persistent viral reservoirs. Finally, we outline the remaining hurdles for T cell-based HIV prevention and cure strategies to complement and synergize with ongoing B cell vaccine approaches.",

Unlike many features assessed in comparative studies between HIV controllers and chronic progressors, genetic polymorphisms are not influenced by HIV infection. Initial studies in long-term non-progressors identified a dramatic enrichment in HLA-B*57 (ref. 21 ), and subsequent genome-wide association studies encompassing over 6,000 infected individuals across multiple large international cohorts have confirmed that the major genetic polymorphisms modulating HIV control reside almost entirely within the HLA-B and HLA-C loci on chromosome six 22-26 . In particular, these studies identified strong associations between HIV control and polymorphic amino acids lining the HLA class I peptide-binding groove, which likely influence the viral peptides that are presented for CD8 + T cell recognition of virally infected cells 22 . Variation at these amino acid positions define specific class I HLA alleles that previous studies have repeatedly shown to be associated with increased likelihood of control (for example, HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*52 and HLA-B*14) and others with risk of progression (for example, HLA-B*07, HLA-B*08 and HLA-B*35).",

Thus, combined analysis of both ex vivo and expanded CD8 + T cell responses in the context of antigen exposure provides a more accurate perspective on which qualities of CD8 + T cells are associated with spontaneous viral control ( fig. 1 ).

On the one hand, a small fraction (1.2% per year) of HIV controllers ultimately lose control, experiencing rebound viraemia and CD4 + T cell depletion 10 . Furthermore, some controllers experience significant immune activation in the absence of detectable viraemia due to persistent viral replication in tissue sites and expression of antigen from defective proviruses 88,116-118 , which can be reduced by ART 119 . On the other hand, a subset of elite controllers is able to maintain a stable state of undetectable viraemia with no appreciable immune activation. Indeed, many elite controllers have extremely small replication-competent proviral reservoirs with low sequence diversity, suggesting functional reservoir suppression [120] [121] [122] [123] . In some elite controllers, viral reservoirs are suppressed so profoundly that replication-competent virus cannot be detected or recovered 102, 124 . Such cases of exceptional control, albeit rare, represent a natural model for immune-mediated functional cure approaches with the goal of durable remission, providing optimism that immune-mediated eradication of infection may be possible.

Moreover, humoral immunity alone may be insufficient for protection against the transmission of cell-associated HIV [135] [136] [137] . By contrast, T cell-based vaccines enable targeting of viral antigens less permissive to viral escape than Env, do not require additional somatic hypermutation and may be able to augment humoral vaccine efforts. Although cellular immunity-based vaccines lack historical precedent from other infectious diseases and cells must become infected before CD8 + T cells can recognize and induce cytolysis, in vitro studies clearly show that HIVspecific CD8 + T cells can kill both activated and resting CD4 + T cells before progeny virus is pro duced 49-51, 138 . This suggests the possibility that these responses may not only serve to control established infection but may also, in sufficient numbers, be able to clear the first infected cells rapidly before persistent reservoirs are established.",

Correlates of protection in NHPs include Env-specific antibody responses measured by ELISA and T cell responses measured by IFN\u03b3 149 . These antigens have been tested in human subjects and have demonstrated safety and tolerability as part of the APPROACH study 150 , with clinical efficacy assessment already underway. As part of a complementary strategy, immunogen designs have also aimed to induce broad cellular immune responses solely against sequence-conserved regions of the virus (tHIVConsvX) 151 , which integrates the concepts of protective specificity and breadth into a single immunogen and may afford even greater coverage of incoming viruses. natural CD8 + T cell-mediated control of VL eventually leads to disease progression, marked by CD4 + T cell decline and uncontrolled VLs. Therapeutic vaccines that elicit effective vaccine-induced CD8 + T cell-mediated control of viraemia aim to protect against disease progression, lower VLs to below the transmission threshold and contain and reduce the residual HIV reservoir in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.

Circumventing this issue are novel rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors that are able to elicit persistently active effector memory CD8 + T cell responses in rhesus macaques due to the constitutive expression of SIV Gag antigen and CMV-induced memory inflation 152, 153 . Remarkably, in numerous studies, these vectors have been able to consistently protect ~50% of animals from viral challenge [154] [155] [156] [157] . Moreover, detailed evaluation at necropsy revealed that vaccinated animals lacked any detectable virus, indicating that continuous effector memory T cell responses were able to clear tissue-associated viral reservoirs and thus achieve sterilizing immunity 155 . This protection was also afforded by attenuated RhCMV, even when challenged 3 years post-vaccination 156 .",

Efficacy trials require monitored interruption of ART, including for individuals not receiving vaccination in controlled studies, which has raised important medical and ethical concerns 175 . Recent evidence that brief treatment interruption has no significant long-term impact on immune activation, drug resistance, reservoir size or composition indicates that such studies are safe [176] [177] [178] . Another challenge is that preventive vaccines may be ineffective in a therapeutic setting. For example, therapeutic immunization with the same RhCMV vector that afforded substantial protection and early clearance of SIV infection in a prophylactic setting was ineffective in reducing the SIV reservoir after therapeutic immunization despite early initiation of ART 179 . Pre-existing immune escape and dysfunctional immune responses in chronically infected individuals represent added challenges for therapeutic immunization approaches as immunization may preferentially expand these responses. Nonetheless, much of the preliminary clinical testing for cellular immune HIV vaccines will likely occur in a therapeutic setting owing to practical considerations in evaluating efficacy and managing risk, and where shifts in CD8 + T cell immunodominance to specific regions of the viral proteome have been previously demonstrated 165, 170 . The development of optimal adjuvants, immunomodulatory agents and latency-reversing agents for coadministration with immunogens will also be important for the success of therapeutic HIV vaccines 180 . Intriguingly, the infusion www.nature.com/nri of two potent bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-1074) early during SHIV infection led to sustainable viral suppression that was lost upon subsequent delivery of a CD8\u03b2-depleting antibody, suggesting a possible vaccinal effect of these bNAbs that can improve the induction of anti viral CD8 + T cells 181 . Although NHP models have provided clear benefits for preclinical vaccine testing 182 , differences in viral diversity, duration of therapy, anti-vector immunity and pathogenesis may contribute towards the limited translation of efficacy from such models to humans.",

However, the above data provide ample support for renewed efforts to develop CD8 + T cell-based HIV vaccines in conjunction with ongoing B cell vaccine efforts. Persons with durable spontaneous control of HIV demonstrate that CD8 + T cells hold substantial promise to combat the HIV epidemic. Mechanistic studies in spontaneous HIV controllers highlight the function, specificity and localization of CD8 + T cells as important determinants of protection, and the ability to uncouple protection from specific HLA alleles represents a key step towards broad clinical translation. Preclinical and clinical vaccine trials have provided additional insights towards the development of improved T cellbased prevention and cure modalities. Further rational design of immunogens and careful selection of appropriate vectors to elicit functional effector-memory CD8 + T cell responses against protective epitopes in vulnerable viral regions represents a promising path forwards for preventive and therapeutic T cell-based HIV vaccines.",

Consistent with this, increased frequencies of functional CD8 + T cells have been observed in the rectal mucosa of HIV controllers 76 . HIV-infected follicular helper CD4 + T cells, which reside within B cell follicles in lymphoid tissue and direct humoral immune responses, constitute a significant fraction of the persistent viral reservoir during chronic infection 77,78 . Importantly, CD8 + T cells are largely excluded from B cell follicles, representing a significant obstacle to CD8 + T cell-mediated clearance of infected follicular helper T cell reservoirs 79 . Recent evidence demonstrates that a population of follicular CD8 + T cells that express the follicle-homing receptor CXCR5 can traffic to or reside in lymphoid tissues under certain circumstances 80-82 . Viral control is associated with a higher proportion and functionality of follicular CD8 + T cells 83-86 , but viral replication within follicles can persist even during elite control of HIV 87,88 , underscoring the need to develop strategies that promote the trafficking and function of HIV-specific follicular CD8 + T cells. Tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells represent an additional subset of CD8 + T cells that control viral infection in various tissue sites 89 . Relative to peripheral blood CD8 + T cells, follicular CD8 + T cells and T RM cells in lymphoid tissues have a lower expression of perforin and granzymes, potentially due to tissue-specific microenvironmental regulation of T cell function as a means to limit tissue inflammation and damage 90,91 .",
