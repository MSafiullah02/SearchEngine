The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolated the causative viral pathogen from throat swabs sample of the affected patients. The pathogen was a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by WHO and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Up to February 18, 2020, 58097 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1870 deaths have been reported in China, posing great threats to global public health.",

As far as we known, the symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe. They can be fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and in some severe cases, kidney failure or death similar to SARS-CoV infection may occur (Huang et al., 2020). However, information regarding to the radiological and clinical features of the pneumonia associated with COVID-19 is still scarce, making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without genetic related laboratory analysis. Moreover, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the gold standard for a confirmative diagnosis of COVID-19, has some limitations, such as certain proportion of false negative results, limited sampling method and shortage of kits. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is increasingly recognized as strong evidence for early diagnosis, because the changes in chest imaging sometimes maybe earlier than clinical symptoms. Considering that fewer confirmed cases were included in previous studies (Chung et al., 2020), we set up a Jiangsu multi-center study, to collect a considerable larger sample size in this retrospective study. The purpose of the study is to improve the comprehension of the newly-emerged diseases in order to make the diagnosis earlier, by describing the comprehensive chest CT characteristics and clinical features of patients with COVID-19, who were admitted to the designated hospitals in Jiangsu province, China.",

The expert group, containing 3 senior radiologists with working experience more than 10 years, would make the final decision if there was a divergent opinion between the two attending.1.Basic CT performancesThe distribution features and the shape of abnormal attenuation, as well as the involved lung lobes, were recorded. If there were any common accompanying diseases of lung, such as obsolete pulmonary tuberculosis, emphysema, bronchiectasia, tumor and others, they would be recorded.2.Certain CT signsThe following CT performances were judged and recorded as 0 or 1 (0 for none, 1 for yes), including vascular enhancement sign (VES, vascular enlargement inside the lesion resulted from congestion and dilation of small vessels), air bronchus sign, reticular/mosaic sign (defined as a collection of innumerable small linear opacities that, by summation, produced an appearance resembling a net (Yun et al., 2011)), bronchial wall thickening, interlobular septal thickening, interlobar fissure displacement, solid nodules, intralesional and/or perilesional bronchiectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, pleural thickening and pericardial effusion.3.Quantified evaluationThe signs of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were analyzed quantitatively using a radiologic scoring system ranging from 0-25 points, which was an adaptation of the method previously used to describe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and SARS (Ng et al., 2004). Each lung lobe was evaluated by 0-5 points, on the basis of the area involved, with score 0 for normal performance, 1 for less than 5% of lung lobe areas involved, 2 for 6%\u201325%, 3 for 26%\u201350%, 4 for 51%\u201375%, and 5 for more than 75%. A total score was eventually recorded via the addition of the score of each lobe.4.CT stagesAccording to the performances of CT images, the cases were classified into four stages\u2013stage I (early stage), stage II (progressive stage), stage III (recovery stage), and stage IV (severe stage). The classification method was mainly according to the following CT performances. Stage I: single or multiple lesions, in irregular, round-like or patchy shapes, generally not involved the whole lung segment, often showed GGO with vascular enlargement. Stage II: more extensive lesions, involved bilateral multiple lobes predominantly in the sub-pleural areas, in irregular, round-like, patchy and \u201canti-butterfly\u201d shapes, scattered or diffused patches even fusing into large patches with density increased, often with vascular enlargement, reticular sign and bronchial wall thickening, occasionally with less fibrosis and sub-segment atelectasis. Stage III: the lesions absorbed and diminished, the focus can be completely absorbed, with residual fiber stripes. Stage IV: bilateral diffuse lesions, more than half of the lung field involved, even extended to the whole lung and presented as \u201cwhite lung\u201d.\n",

Merely 16 cases (7.31%, 16/219) were involved with single lobe. 208 cases (94.98%, 208/219) were mainly distributed in the lower lungs and/or the periphery of the lungs. The shape of the lesions was mainly irregular (88.13%, 193/219), followed by small patches (86.3%, 189/219), strip-like (69.41%, 152/219), round-like (49.32%, 108/219) and \u201canti-butterfly\u201d (47.95%, 105/219). 60 patients (27.4%, 60/219) were with common accompanying diseases of lung, of which emphysema (including localized emphysema) and bullae was the most common (88.33%, 53/60), followed by bronchiectasia (16.67%, 10/60).According to the performance of chest CT, the patients were divided into stage I-IV, as the cases showed in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n. 80 cases (36.53%, 80/219) were classified into stage I group, 86 cases (39.27%, 86/219) into stage II group, 43 cases (24.2%, 43/219) into stage III group and 10 cases (4.57%, 10/219) into stage IV.2.Certain CT signsAmong the 219 patients with positive chest HRCT performances, 207 cases were with VES, 205 with interlobular septal thickening, 184 with air bronchus sign, 173 with intralesional and/or perilesional bronchiectasis, 170 with pleural thickening, 138 with solid nodules, 135 with reticular/mosaic sign, 124 with interlobar fissure displacement, 76 with bronchial wall thickening, 29 with minor pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, 21 with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.The frequency of VES was the highest, but there was no significant difference among the four stage groups, as showed in Table 2\n. The frequency of interlobular septal thickening, air bronchus sign and intralesional and/or perilesional bronchiectasis in stage I was significantly lower than that in stage II and stage III (P\n < 0.008). The frequency of reticular sign, pleural thickening and interlobar fissure displacement was the lowest in stage I (P\n < 0.008). The frequency of solid nodules in stage IV was significantly higher than that in stage 1 (P\n < 0.008). The frequency of bronchial wall thickening was lower in stage I than that in stage III and stage IV (P\n < 0.008).The frequency of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was relatively small. The frequency of pleural effusion was lower in stage I than that in stage III and stage IV, and it was also lower in stage II than that in stage IV (P\n < 0.008).

The GGO score was higher than consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping scores of all the patients, however, there was no significant difference of GGO score among CT stages (P\n > 0.05).2.Correlation analysisThere were significant correlations among the ABG analysis indices - PaO2, SpO2 and OI, as well as among the CT scores of GGO, consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. However, there were no correlations between the ABG analysis indices and CT scores (P > 0.05), except the weak relevance between the fibrosis score and PaO2 (P = 0.017, r = 0.218) and between fibrosis score and SpO2 (P = 0.032, r = 0.206), as showed in Table 4\n.\n",

The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections might be attributed to the protection from X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity (Jaillon et al., 2019). Almost 90% patients in present study were classified as common type. Fever and cough were main symptoms. However, some patients presented initially with atypical symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. A large proportion of patients were with normal blood routine examination. Up to February 18, 2020, a total of 629 COVID-19 confirmed cases had been reported without death in Jiangsu Province, compared to Hubei Province 59989 cases with 1789 death. Most cases in Jiangsu were with mild clinical symptoms and approximately 90% patients had epidemiologic linkage to Hubei Province or closely contacted with other confirmed cases in present study, suggesting that the virus might mutate to produce the first generation, the second generation and so on, with the longer the mutation time, the lower the toxicity, as the MERS-CoV (Poletto and Colizza, 2016, Drosten et al., 2014). Because of the relatively lower toxicity, clinical symptoms are slight and the prognosis is relatively good.",

Chest HRCT is a critical screening method for COVID-19 due to its high sensitivity and convenience, although 15 patients with COVID-19 were without abnormal lung changes on initial CT images in present study. Additionally, 6 patients were with pneumonia detected by HRCT, but initial RT-PCR was negative with follow-up test positive. These results suggested that both chest HRCT examination and RT-PCR detection of novel coronavirus nucleic acid had limitations which inevitably lead to false-negative. In the follow-up of the initial negative CT cases, pneumonia would be emerged in some patients, while the initial negative RT-PCR cases would be emerged with positive outcomes after redetection for one time or more than once. It suggestedthe critical importance to combine the two methods in the early stage of the disease to exclude the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

VES was the most frequent sign, followed by interlobular septal thickening, air bronchus sign, intralesional and/or perilesional bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, solid nodules, reticular/mosaic sign, etc. These CT performances of COVID-19 were similar to previous studies (Chung et al., 2020, Noval Coronavirus, 2020). In addition, a few cases of mediastinal lymph node enlargement, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion were found in present study, which were not reported yet. It might be due to the relatively small sample size of previous study. Furthermore, there were group differences of some CT signs among different CT stages, though GGOs and VES sign were most frequently seen in each CT stages without group differences in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In the early stage, interlobular septal thickening, air bronchus sign, intralesional and/or perilesional bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening were less seen than that in progressive stage. The reticular sign, pleural thickening and interlobar fissure displacement were not common in early stage. The frequency of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was relatively small. The quantified evaluation of CT images demonstrated that consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were minor in the early stage. These results suggested that each CT stage had its characteristic CT signs and performances, making it possible to radiologists and physicians to quickly obtained the stage of the pneumonia.",
