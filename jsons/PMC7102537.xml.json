The respiratory illness often evolves into shortness of breath and severe respiratory illness. Disease severity varies widely from asymptomatic cases to fatal outcomes. It is believed that most infected persons do not show symptoms as indicated by a seroprevalence survey that estimated the number of seropositive people in Saudi Arabia to be nearly 45,000 persons [3]. The case fatality rate among clinical cases has been estimated to be 40% [4]. Although the high case fatality of the disease and the frequent occurrence of outbreaks provoked calls to develop a vaccine [5], several obstacles were encountered including lack of an animal model and the high cost of vaccine development [6].",

Humans primarily acquire the virus from camels either directly through direct contact with infected camels\u2019 respiratory secretions or indirectly through contact with people who have had contact with infected camels\u2019 respiratory secretions [18]. These primary infections may in sequence lead to secondary human-to-human transmission through close contact with infected human-respiratory secretions usually in the healthcare [11,12,16,[19], [20], [21], [22]] or, less commonly, the household settings [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Community-based transmission outside the household settings is rare [12,27]. Factors that cause amplification of MERS-CoV infection in the healthcare settings include suboptimal adherence to standard infection control practice and respiratory etiquette, failure to perform triage to segregate patients with acute respiratory illness particularly in the Emergency Departments and Dialysis units, overcrowding of patients, and delayed diagnosis because of atypical presentation often mimicking heart failure or acute dengue [16,[19], [20], [21], [22],28].",

It is thought of as the number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population that is totally susceptible. When R0 is <1, the infection will die out in the long run, whereas, if R0 is > 1, the infection will be able to spread in a population. Generally, the larger the value of R0, the harder it is to control the epidemic. The basic reproductive number in our study was 0.9 which indicated that each case would on average lead to less than one additional case and that transmission of this infection will eventually stop if there was no external re-infection. The continually reported MERS-CoV cases with occasional clusters observed in Saudi Arabia despite the low R0 is likely due to repeated external re-introduction of the virus from camels.",

This possible seasonal increase of human MERS-CoV cases corresponds to the end of the calving season (December\u2013February) for camels in Saudi Arabia [30,31]. It also corresponds to the weaning season when camels are weaned of milk at 12\u201316 months of age. A recent prospective study showed that MERS-CoV detection by RT-PCR in dromedary camels was more common in the period between November and January, corresponding to the camels\u2019 calving season [32]. Several studies also showed that MERS-CoV RNA shedding is more common in juvenile than in adult camels [[31], [32], [33], [34]]. Therefore, juvenile camels younger than 2 years of age are likely to be an important source of new MERS-CoV infections in camels and humans leading to higher incidence of human infection during the period between March and May [31,33,34].",

Enhancing MERS-CoV data-sharing and analysis for better understanding of the epidemiology of this novel virus would help in devising effective preventive strategies to reduce the burden of this viral infection on the health system.",
