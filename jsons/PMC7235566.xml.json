The patient was treated with lumpectomy and sentinel-lymph node biopsy, to be followed by adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy (4256 cGy in 16 fractions) and endocrine therapy, as per multidisciplinary tumor board recommendations. At the time of CT simulation, the patient did not report fever or respiratory symptoms and her lung parenchyma on the CT simulation was normal. Approximately 2 weeks later, in March 2020, RT was initiated and the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient was treated on our Varian Halcyon unit, utilizing daily KV CBCTs for patient set-up. During the first week of treatment, no radiographic pulmonary abnormalities were noted on daily review of the CBCT soft tissue windows.",

Given that cancer patients require frequent medical visits to treatment facilities, the risk of inadvertent dissemination of COVID-19 poses a serious threat to this vulnerable patient population. Adding to this challenge is the covert nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with rates of asymptomatic infection being reported as high as 80%. Up to 50% of asymptomatic patients can have radiographic abnormalities prior to the onset of symptoms [22]. Radiographic imaging findings are important in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. In cancer patients receiving CBCT as part of their RT, review of lung windows to screen for COVID-19 changes could lead to early detection of the infection in asymptomatic patients.",

The imaging features of this viral pneumonia are diverse, typically ranging from normal appearance to diffuse changes in the lungs; patients with multiple comorbidities are more likely to have bilateral and diffuse disease [10]. Overall, there is a slight predilection for the right lower lobe. The extent of disease on CT increases gradually from the subclinical period throughout the first 3 weeks, then decreases thereafter [10], but radiographic changes may continue to evolve beyond 26 days of symptoms [10, 12]. Asymptomatic patients are more likely to have unilateral, multifocal GGOs. After symptom onset, bilateral and diffuse GGOs are predominant. In the progressive stage, GGOs are relatively decreased in frequency, with a transition to consolidation and mixed-pattern development. As the disease peaks, GGOs decrease further, and peak lung involvement is characterized by increasing crazy-paving patterns, reticulation, along with bronchiolectasis and thickening of the adjacent pleura. The resolving stage demonstrates decreasing consolidation and absence of crazy-paving patterns following the first 2-3 weeks of disease [11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25]. Our patient\u2019s radiographic changes were generally consistent with the above findings; during the subclinical period, GGO\u2019s were predominantly located in the peripheral right lower lobe and progressed in the symptomatic stage to become more diffuse and bilateral. Based on our patient\u2019s available imaging, her CT lung abnormalities appeared to peak in severity approximately 11 days after symptom onset, followed by gradual resolution of GGO\u2019s as demonstrated in her diagnostic CTs (Figure 3).",

Modalities include KV port-films using 2D x-ray and/or cone-beam CT scans [15, 28]. Traditionally, patients treated with breast tangent RT do not undergo daily IGRT, but rather weekly portal imaging. The Varian Halcyon 2.0 platform utilizes KV CBCT, and iterative CBCT imaging for improved soft tissue definition [29]. Patients with thoracic and breast malignancies undergoing treatment on the Halcyon receive CBCT for set-up verification, which opportunely encompasses the lungs. Pulmonary infiltrates potentially indicative of infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be identifiable on routine daily CBCTs, which would not otherwise have been appreciable with KV orthogonal imaging or weekly portal imaging. Given the relatively high proportion of breast cancer patients treated in most radiation oncology departments, Halcyon\u2019s daily KV CBCT imaging presents a unique opportunity for lung evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suppli et al. have reported on early pulmonary findings discovered on retrospective review of daily CBCTs done in a lung cancer patient admitted to the ICU during RT, who ultimately died of COVID-19 infection [30].",

            "text": "COVID-19 has impacted the United States on a level not seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918, and NYC rapidly became the epicenter of the pandemic. Due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic patients and the limited availability of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing, a combination of screening for symptoms, clinical acumen, and use of available technology is necessary for the prompt identification and management of these patients. As many cancer patients undergo routine CBCT during RT, familiarity with COVID-related lung changes may lead to earlier detection, diagnosis and treatment, while decreasing inadvertent dissemination amongst this vulnerable patient population.",
