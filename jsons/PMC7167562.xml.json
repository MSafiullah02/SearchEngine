A pandemic is generally defined as a new disease that rapidly spreads in a number of countries and continents. Even a mild pandemic can kill several millions of people (Osterholm, 2005). Over the past hundred years or so, we have seen three deadly pandemics, namely, in 1918, 1957 and 1968 (Mills, Robins, & Lipsitch, 2004). Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) is the most recent pandemic that has resulted in unprecedented social and economic impact on society. Covid-19 is one of a large group of viruses that was transmitted to humans from bats in a local live animal market in Wuhan in late 2019 (Ji, Wang, Zhao, Zai, & Li, 2020). It infects the upper respiratory tract and can result in pneumonia and other associated illnesses, which can eventually affect the central nervous system, ultimately leading to death for those with underlying health conditions. Given the potential for human-to-human transmission and that inventing a vaccine would ideally take about one or two years, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that governments worldwide should quickly intensify active surveillance to identify infected individuals to allow rapid isolation and quarantine (Heymann & Shindo, 2020).",

Cities contribute a whopping 80% of the total global GDP and host about half of the global population (The World Bank, 2019). As a result, cities became hubs for the quick transmission of the pandemic. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and increased global travel attributable to globalization have all contributed to this transmission. However, we are fortunate that our current cities are more resilient than ever before. This is due to the increased adoption of smart technologies such as the Internet of things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI). Especially cities in China and Western democracies are known for adopting smart city based technologies. For the purpose of this paper, Western democracies include the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Spain. These countries were highly affected by Covid-19 in the initial three months after its first transmission.",

For instance, China's response has been described by the WHO-China Joint Mission report as \u201cthe most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history\u201d (WHO, 2020a, p. 16). Whereas the response from Western democracies was considered inadequate. With this background, the current paper reviews academic papers, WHO reports and newspaper articles published in the first three months following the Covid-19 outbreak in China to answer the following research question: How do governments in China and Western democracies differ in their technological response to control the transmission of the pandemic?",

However, the Western democracies, have chosen to adopt the human-driven approach to tackle the pandemic. This research argues that the impact of the human-driven approach is slower than the techno-driven approach in controlling the transmission of the virus. It is further argued that while technology can contribute to enhancing resilience and controlling transmission, censorship and human involvement with technology limit its potential. As a result, the impact of smart technologies is potentially moderated by the social and political contexts in which they are implemented.",

            "text": "China's interest in using smart technologies for governance dates back to the overall shift in its innovation policy that began in the early 2000s (Ling & Naughton, 2016; Liu, Simon, Sun, & Cao, 2011). According to the 2015 statistics, the urban population in China accounts for 56% of the total population, and given the improved living standards and new employment opportunities in cities, it is expected to increase exponentially in the next two decades to 76% (Wu, Zhang, Shen, Mo, & Peng, 2018). In response to the growing population, China has taken an active role in building smart cities where technologies have been used significantly to aid urban governance. One estimate indicates that there are about 500 world-class smart cities present in China (Mak, 2020). Wuhan, the most affected city during the current COVID-19 outbreak itself is a smart city. China stated its commitment to building smart cities in the 12th Five-Year Plan published in 2010 that set a blueprint for the socio, economic and political goals for the next five years. The National New Urbanization Plan which came into effect in 2014 and lasts until 2020 has largely taken charge of constructing new smart cities and remodeling existing cities into smart cities (Zhu, Li, & Feng, 2019). Furthermore, the former Premier of China, Li Keqiang, emphasized in 2015 that smart cities and smart technologies are the two major priorities in the development of the country. The 13th Five-Year Plan, the first under President Xi Jinping's leadership, takes the smart cities vision even more seriously with the aim of not only promoting them but also creating inter-city infrastructures and partnership building among them, which would further aid the national government in its governance (Dameri, Benevolo, Veglianti, & Li, 2019). The concentration of political power in the central government and its control over the provinces and cities allows it to quickly make arrangements for coordination.",

Furthermore, smart devices are connected to utilities such as rubbish bins, which are electronically connected to a system that alerts authorities when they are full (Andrelini, 2019). Thus, both the built environment and citizens in the major cities have been oriented towards the adoption of the enhanced use of the IoT for the past 10 years. As a result, China has the most sophisticated IoT industry, thanks to its aspirations for building smart cities (Kshetri, 2017). In addition, it has the best technological manufacturing industry in the world (Li, 2018). With the help of the IoT, big data, and AI, cities can perform continuous monitoring, offer catastrophe warnings, and make quick decisions (Zhu et al., 2019). Among the other sectors, health care has benefited significantly due to the heightened adoption of new-age technologies (Sun & Medaglia, 2019). As a result, China has one of the strongest technological potentials for handling pandemics compared to other countries.",

Similar to the Chinese context, population growth in urban areas has resulted in cities, especially in North America and Europe, adopting smart city technologies (Albino, Berardi, & Dangelico, 2015). The European Union, for example, initiated several strategies including the European Smart Cities & Communities initiative (Kylili & Fokides, 2015), and the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities (Cardullo & Kitchin, 2019). These programs allow European cities access resources from the European Commission to transform their cities into smart cities. Most Covid-19 affected countries in the Western context are known for their advanced smart cities. These countries are highly interconnected with each other largely due to their geographical proximity and the trading partnerships they have with China. This is the reason the Covid-19 pandemic was able to easily transfer to the major cities in these countries from China (Cohen & Kupfesrchmidt, 2020).",

Other smart cities in the USA include, Washington DC, Boston, Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia (Pyzyk, 2019). When it comes to Europe, Barcelona, a highly affected city in Spain, also built its smart city technological ecosystem to enhance its usage of smart technologies. Especially, IoT driven services in Barcelona smart city have claimed to improve quality of life for its citizens (Kamel Boulos & Al-Shorbaji, 2014).

The techno-driven approach largely places heightened importance on technologies and makes citizens subordinate to the technologies adopted in the cities. Techno-driven approach does not take \u2018context\u2019 into consideration, rather expects technologies to fix all the glitches in cities (Janssen & Kuk, 2016). This approach resonates with the \u2018hard technological determinism\u2019 that considers new technologies as basis of society where they play a pivotal role in structuring the social systems (Bannister & Connolly, 2020; Nograsek & Vintar, 2014). The inherent capabilities of smart technologies are expected to solve problems experienced by the governments (Helbig, Gil-Garcia, & Ferro, 2009). While Techno-driven approach may be more effective in imposing law and order and offer techno-driven objective governance, it may also curtail human freedom, enhance censorship and raise ethical questions (Bimber, 1994).",

Under this approach, governments also enhance social and human capital among their citizens which allow developing technologies based on the local need. There is an overall understanding that human-driven approach allows governments adopt smart technologies to ensure better citizen engagement, to offer accountability (Gil-Garcia, Zhang, & Puron-Cid, 2016; Mora, Deakin, Reid, & Angelidou, 2019), and streamline interactions between communities and government (Androutsopoulou, Karacapilidis, Loukis, & Charalabidis, 2019). Additionally, citizens seek greater participation in the planning of urban development strategies, often initiating local enterprises (Kummitha, 2019).

WHO has urged the Chinese government, medical community and scientists to publish information actively about the emergent trends. As the virus transmitted to other parts of the globe towards the end of January, Western media have made a significant effort to show how technology has been used by Western democracies in controlling the transmission. Further, the scientific publishing houses have fast tracked publishing on Covid-19 and made all the published research openly available for anyone to use. In addition, media outlets have shown keen interest in not only publishing current trends but also various interventions being initiated to control the outbreak.

In cases where citizens failed to report their travel history in the affected areas, IoT devices were used to ascertain their travel history and flag those cases (Liu & Li, 2020). For instance, the travel of individuals to the affected areas was monitored and reported to the concerned authorities by AI applications (Jie, 2020). In addition, corporations allowed the government to access their systems hosting the mobile applications (apps) that citizens routinely use to track down their travel history.

Every citizen is allocated with a QR (also known as Quick Response) code, which allows to track his/her movements. When citizens use public services such as public transportation or visit a super market, they are expected to scan their QR code. When infectors are detected, then those who could have been possibly infected, including those who travelled on the same bus or those who visited a super market at the same time, are informed and a quarantine procedure followed thereafter. Based on the information shared, individuals were allocated a particular color code. Those allocated a red color code were either affected by the virus or those had travelled recently to Hubei province. Those given a yellow code were required to self-isolate for two weeks (the incubation period for detecting the virus; Lauer et al., 2020), and those given a green code retained access to the city (Jie, 2020). AI determined the allocation of codes but very little information is available about the procedure used for allocation (Krolik & Satariano, 2020).",

A mismatch between regional and national policy regulations furthered the complications in sharing this anonymized data. Such data are useful to understand how many people are following the imposed strict lockdowns (Polina & Busvine, 2020). This is quite in contrast to the Chinese approach which was more active in identifying infected individuals. Governments often find it hard to navigate through data privacy laws and not to breach the trust conferred by the public on the government (Servick, 2020). In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) partnered with Amazon, Microsoft and Hancock to analyze the data collected by the NHS telephone service to move available resources to tackle the pandemic.

When Li Wenliang, the whistle-blower doctor who first identified the infection trend while working in the Wuhan Central Hospital sent a message in a chat forum to fellow doctors about the potential of the virus outbreak, his views were censored. Wuhan city authorities forced him to write an apology, and the government claimed that the doctor was disturbing the social order (Green, 2020). A total of eight individuals were investigated by the state in connection with this development. Many activists who questioned the government's initial response strategy were forced into quarantine despite not showing any symptoms related to the virus (Xiong & Gan, 2020). China is notoriously known for employing smart technologies to censor any content or data that citizens upload to social media websites that the government does not feel comfortable with (Westcott, 2020). United Nations Development Program (2015) for instance highlighted that, Chinese smart cities are largely focused on the technology infrastructure, known as hardware. Communities are seen as passive beneficiaries of these technologies rather than playing an active role in the society, which resonates with the hard technological determinism (Hu & Zheng, 2020).

The Mayor of Wuhan admitted that there had been a delay in announcing the information about the virus as the national government had not given clearance in a timely manner (Ayittey, Dzuvor, Ayittey, Chiwero, & Habib, 2020). In addition, it was not until 20th of January that information about human-to-human transmission was announced. However, Wenliang in his WeChat message sent on 31st December had emphasized the human-to-human transmission potential of the virus. Research has now confirmed that human-to-human transmission took place starting from the middle of December 2019 (Li, 2020). Although the Premier Jinping later ordered the free flow of information in a timely fashion, an array of information sources about Covid-19 were censored from the internet, depriving people of the opportunity to know more about the virus. As Kavanagh (2020) highlighted, openness, transference and quick reporting remain active response strategies during an outbreak, which had been altogether missed due to the authoritative nature of government action.

However, governments to different extents downplayed the potential of transmission and the damage it could cause. For instance, the president of the USA was vocal until the second week of March that the damage would be minimal. A similar strategy was visible in the case of the UK. Gaps in governance resulting from the decentralized political system remain a constraint to effectively implementing strategies. In addition, the individual freedom and rights conferred to individuals, the privacy protection laws enacted and the human-driven approaches adopted in smart cities, all limit the potential to actively adopt technologies to constrain the transmission of the virus compared to China.",

Governments may gain full control over the situation by adopting a techno-driven approach and imposing technologies to tackle the pandemic. The enhanced use of technology allowed Chinese authorities to reach into the private space of individuals and breach the privacy of its citizens. Such a forceful approach helped the Chinese regime keep the virus transmission under control in a relatively quick timeframe (Johnson, Robinson, & Philpot, 2020). The level of technology deployed to impose government regulations shows that technology is useful for taking forward the stringent policies set forth. The well-established smart technology ecosystem aids their cities and lets the national government coordinate the strategy. While conventionally, societal needs and norms determine individual behavior, modern days mark the enhanced use of technologies to impose discipline and compliance. The Covid-19 response from China provides direct answers for smart city researchers who raised questions around the problem-solving potential of urban technologies (Greenfield, 2013). The techno-driven approach proven effective to control the virus transmission. However, Western democracies may choose much more holistic approaches by the means of consensus and persuasion, where technologies are used to educate citizens and ensure their compliance with the rules set forth. Under such circumstances, controlling the transmission of the pandemic may be slow and time-consuming. Although technological ecosystems are active in Western democracies, they are mostly oriented towards adopting human-driven approach.",

Concealing information about the virus for over a month allowed it to transmit among the population and across regions. As a result, the nature of the political and institutional context moderates the level of surveillance and discipline imposed. The political and institutional context played a major role in limiting technological determinism (Janssen & Kuk, 2016). In the Western context, the societal and institutional set up does not allow the top-down approaches followed in the Chinese context. Thus, it is safe to argue that, although smart technologies are said to have transformative powers, their potential is subject to the social, political and institutional context in which they are deployed (Kuk & Janssen, 2013; Kummitha, 2020). Earlier research has articulated that smart city initiatives often lack the engagement of social and political conditions (Luque-Ayala & Marvin, 2015). However, the present work highlights that the political and institutional context has indeed played a key role in determining the course of action for controlling the virus transmission.",

The literature has also emphasized that smart city spaces are governed by algorithmic administration and categorization (Dalton, Wilmott, Fraser, & Thatcher, 2020), whereas this research demonstrates that such an understanding is merely an imaginary. This research also highlights that governments continue to retain their agency and conceal information that they deem not to be shared, which limits the influence of technologies. Although the smart city literature emphasizes that technologies aid city authorities in addressing stubborn social problems, the way that Covid-19 has been handled highlights that the techno-driven approach do not directly result in technological determinism, rather, it offers a vector of options for decision-makers to choose, based on their own judgment. As a result, the impact of smart technologies is less effective in smart cities than has been projected in the literature (Hollands, 2008), because of the way humans use, interpret, manipulate and communicate the trends picked by the IoT based on political and institutional needs. In addition, the potential of technologies is constrained by the social and institutional arrangements prevalent in national contexts.

However, one specific aspect governments should address during health emergencies is ensuring that their citizens are fully informed about their privacy rights and assured that any data collected during the pandemic will be handled to benefit the society at large. Governments also need to ensure that the enhanced collection and use of data will be temporary and the activity will cease once the situation comes under control. In this way, governments will be able to assure their citizens about their rights and the governmental responsibility to protect these rights. Such an approach allows citizens to voluntarily come forward to communicate their health data and download dedicated mobile apps to share their health updates and location histories. In countries where the top-down adoption of technologies is impossible, this approach allows crowdsourcing the information from citizens. A specific strength of technological advancement is that communities even in the developing and least developed countries have access to mobile technologies, and hence, data may still be sourced (Klaus, 2020).",

While medical researchers and scientists are active in bringing out new findings and data about the pandemic, scholars from other disciplines should come forward and contribute to advancing our combined potential to face this pandemic.

There is also evidence that community-based initiatives, both technological and non-technological in nature, are in effect to serve the most needy and vulnerable. For instance, community-based apps, such as the Nextdoor app, offer necessary support for those in need in the community. Thus, it is worthwhile to study community-level resilience and how it supplements or even replaces technological responses to handling the pandemic. The other research avenue is to study how governments, technology firms and international agencies address the infodemic to control fake news.
