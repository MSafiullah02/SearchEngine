In addition, disasters have become more heterogeneous. The current structure of Korean disaster management is unable to fully address the impacts of disasters, due to political, economic, social, and cultural reasons. To resolve this, a more collaborative, integrated, and comprehensive form of emergency management is required.",

Also, government institutions at the central government level (being similar to the U.S. federal level) have started to recruit emergency managers as public employees. However, governments have maintained that the capability or knowledge of Korean emergency managers is still limited when it comes to dealing with diverse disasters, both natural disasters and manmade emergencies (Kim, 2014). To be professional Korean emergency managers, they have to be oriented towards multiple disciplines. Such professionals possess specialized training, skill, or education, whereas non-professionals do not. Restrictively speaking, professional emergency managers concentrate on their own areas of responsibility, but they clearly need multiple disciplines apart from their own specialization.",

By depending upon a single aspect or one-sided viewpoint, the unidisciplinary model addresses reactive disaster management, which does not consider planning (Culwick and Patel, 2013, Hartkopf, 2003). On the other hand, a multidisciplinary approach strongly supports disaster planning. Note also that similar terms have been used in place of multidisciplinary, such as interdisciplinary, intradisciplinary, crossdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary. Among them, interdisciplinary has been used frequently or interchangeably with multidisciplinary. What they all have in common is the need for more than one discipline and the interconnection of one discipline to another.",

With the rise of Ministry of Public Safety and Security (MPSS) at the end of 2014, they continued to study which professions would require the human resources of MPSS. In fact, the NEMA was transformed into the MPSS after experiencing the sinking of ferry Sewol in mid-2014.",

Subsequently, flooding may cause fires due to electric leakage. Complex situations such as these scenarios will not be addressed by a linear or single approach. Understanding and quick action, looking into alternatives, and applying a multidisciplinary approach have a greater chance of succeeding and in helping to mobilize as many people and organizations as possible to work together to resolve problems.

Many practitioners, though knowledgeable, may not be readily available or may not have access to relevant networks on account of (geographical) location or other barriers (e.g., language). Some educators, trainers, and researchers also have different means of interpreting certain disaster management data or model (Gonzalez et al., 2012). For this reason, it is crucial to discuss and establish appropriate techniques and strategies for better communications including exchange of best practices towards solidifying multidisciplinary approach.",
