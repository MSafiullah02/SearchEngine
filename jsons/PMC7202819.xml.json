There are many amplification free[7] and amplification based[8] methods for nucleic acid detection. In traditional molecular testing labs, the experimenters need to move the liquid from one tube to another. The sensitivity of nucleic acid detection can increase after amplification. However, pipetting based nucleic acid assays have two disadvantages. One is that complex operating steps cannot meet the requirements of POCT[9]. Another is that target formed aerosol after amplification may contaminate the environment[10], especially some highly infectious viruses which may put technicians in danger. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has become the standard of some infectious disease detection. Although the amplification and detection steps of qPCR are combined in one closed tube, making nucleic acid detection convenient and time-saving[11], the extraction and purification steps are not integrated.",

Recently, microfluidic technology was well developed. It has been widely used in life science, environmental science and diagnosis. Integrated microfluidic chips are gradually moving from laboratory research to commercial application[12]. Microfluidics technology replicates testing functions of traditional biochemical laboratory on a chip but it is difficult to move small amounts of liquid in tight spaces. To solve it, most of microfluidic chips with narrow aisles require pumps, valves or centrifuges to control the liquid transfer, which limits their application and promotion in portable POCT. Some capillary flow assay based or paper based chips can avoid using external equipment to pipette when preventing and monitoring public health outbreaks[13, 14]. However, if the analysis channel is long or the liquid composition is complicated, the detection sensitivity will be significantly affected by the liquid evaporation. In summary, an integrated nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection system without pipetting is needed.",

Many magnetic bead extraction kits have become commercial products[15]. They can move under the magnetic field, avoiding removing the lid and pipetting, which contributes to the integration, portability and rapidity of nucleic acid assays[16]. There are several advantages of magnetic particles assisted nucleic acid assays. Firstly, it is a safe and environmentally friendly nucleic acid extraction method compared with some chemical methods[17]. Secondly, researchers can choose different types and sizes of magnetic particles according to their samples, which is beneficial to improve extraction efficiency and reduce costs[18]. Finally, the magnetic particles can be driven under the magnetic fields with no limitation of liquid volume. It is promising for the integrated nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection[19, 20]. Electromagnet strategy can not only promote the automation of the integrated system, but also help the full mixing of magnetic particles and reaction liquids. The presence of electromagnet will contribute to the automation of integrated nucleic acid detection platform. When using the electromagnet, the magnetic field can be controlled by power-on and power-off. The strength of the magnetic field can be controlled by the intensity of current. In this way, we can control the speed of magnetic particles when passing through different reaction tanks by controlling the current intensity. Also, it will be convenient to accelerate the full mixing of magnetic particles with reaction liquids by electromagnetic field[21].",

Among the above three methods, chemical synthesis methods are the commonly used while physical methods are less used[30]. Physical synthesis methods, including gas-phase deposition[31] and electron beam lithography[32], do not require chemical reagents or complex manual operation. However, it is difficult to control the size of the synthesized particles, which is hard to meet the requirements of bioanalysis. Microbiological synthesis of magnetic particles is a green chemistry approach with low energy and high recovery rate. It was reported that various of magnetic particles can be synthesized by bacteria, fungi, yeast and virus[33]. Although some efforts have been made to optimize the microbial cultivation methods and the extraction techniques, the incubation of microorganisms and production of magnetic particles takes too much time[34]. Chemical methods are the most commonly used, such as oxidation method[35], chemical coprecipitation[36], sol-gel synthesis[37], aerosol/vaporphase method[38], hydrothermal reaction[39, 40] and so on. Chemical methods can synthesize magnetic particles with controllable form and size. In order to improve the efficiency of synthesis, the chemical reactions should be performed under high temperature and high pressure[41], which consumes lots of energy. It is notable that the residuals of stabilizer or metal oxide during the preparation process may influence subsequent biological experiments. Therefore, the separation, washing and drying steps after the reaction are also important.",

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) can be used to measure the hydrodynamic size distribution and zeta potential of magnetic particles. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) experiments can be performed to measure the non-coated magnetic particles.

When the solution is at low pH and high salt concentration, the negatively charged phosphate backbone of nucleic acids bind to the positively charged surface of particles[44]. It was reported that silica coated magnetic particles could extract HBV and HCV nucleic acids from serum in 30 min. 1 g of prepared silica coated magnetic particles can adsorb up to 10.6 mg DNA or 7.7 mg RNA with 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) at pH 5.5[45].

In high concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride solutions, nucleic acids can bind to the surface of carboxyl coated magnetic particles, the mechanism of which is complex. In general, in solution containing low concentrations of salt and PEG, DNA are at random-coil state. The increasing concentration of PEG and sodium chloride promotes the condensation and compaction of DNA. The negative charge on the condensed part of DNA is almost neutralized in PEG solution with a small part of negative charge remaining on the uncondensed part of DNA, eliminating electrostatic repulsion between nucleic acids and magnetic particles and promoting the DNA adsorption on the surface of magnetic particles[51]. The carboxyl coated magnetic particle method is expeditious for extracting of PCR-ready DNA from staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages without using toxic compounds[52]. Apart from isolation mRNA from mammalian cells, carboxyl coated magnetic particles can also be used to extract the supercoiled form of plasmid DNA from agarose gel.

To apply it to on-site detection, disposable cartridges with manual pipetting are studied. In the disposable cartridge, operators need to manually move the pipettor up and down, left and right.

The two wells are covered with a layer of liquid wax, which can connect the two channels and prevent the liquid from mixing. The clinical samples are added to the well of the lysis buffer and then nucleic acids are released from the cells. Magnetic particles that adsorb nucleic acids shuttle through water/oil interface (Fig. 3\nA). In addition to avoiding the bulky equipment and lowering the assay costs, the time required for nucleic acid purification has been shortened and the steps have been simplified[59]. This is the initial device for magnetic particles assisted nucleic acid assays. This device separates the solution in the wells from external environment through the liquid max which contacts with the external environment directly. Different from it, in T-junction device the oil only separates lysis buffer and elution buffer but cannot formed a closed environment. The T-junction device is composed of three wells connecting by a long channel and a short channel (Fig. 3 B). The lysate well and elution well are connected at both ends of the long channel. If the oil is not enough, it can be added through the middle oil well. To make the magnetic particles travel through the channel smoothly, the relatively large passing area is required. This device is applied to extract influenza RNA from nasopharyngeal swab sample[60]. The overall pattern can be printed on a microfluidic chip by using three-dimensional print technology. The cellulose functionalized magnetic particles can recover 61% HPV plasmid concentrations in 15 min, which is promising for the point-of-care diagnosis[61].",

In 2012, the immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST) device was reported. The reaction solutions are not in contact with the external environment. The horizontal IFAST device consists of three wells and two trapezoidal microfluidic conduits arranged in a line. The lysis well and elution well are separated by surface tension (Fig. 3 C). The sensitivity of this device is comparable to the commercial magnetic extraction kits. Furthermore, the time it takes to accomplish extraction process is much less than conventional magnetic extraction kits with manual intensive. It was verified that nucleic acids of Clostridium botulinum type A in the food matrices could be extracted by the device, replacing tedious wash and centrifugation steps[62]. The IFAST device uses surface tension to separate different reaction liquids, greatly simplifying the design of the device for magnetic nucleic acid assays. The wells of IFAST device are designed in a straight line, which is easier to automate. Combined with an automated liquid handler and a custom-built magnet actuator, operation of multiple IFAST and multiple arrays of extraction are realized. The robotic operation gains higher capture and higher repeatability compared with manual operation[63].",

When the surface tension rises to a critical value, the volume of carriers remains constant, which will provide a guidance for the size of magnetic particles and the value of surface tension[69].

The prototype extraction cassette is composed of glass capillary chambers (each chamber 80 mm length; 2 mm inter diameter) and pipet tips (1000 \u03bcL) acted as spacers between each capillary chamber. The capillary chamber is used to place the samples to be detected and the other capillary chambers are preloaded with reaction reagents. To make the design simplifier, the prototype extraction cassette was transformed into the continuous tube (61 cm length; 1.6 mm inter diameter) in which each solution chamber is separated by the 2 mm air gap. The silica coated magnetic particles can connect the entire extraction process as a whole and finish the whole process in 15 min. However, the extraction recovery of RNA remains to be improved.

It was found that fluid stability is maximized if the inter diameter of the tube is below 0.8 mm. When using less than 0.2 mg of magnetic particles, the amount of solution carryover is minimized[72]. To transport more magnetic particles, relatively wider tube and water-air interface with stronger surface tension can be chosen.

To better apply water-air valve, the magneto-capillary valve technologies that magnetic particles travel through discrete liquids separated by water-air immiscible phase are summarized and compared, including the patterned air valve, the geometrical air valve and the paraffin valve. The structure of air valve is simple and of good pinch-off in the narrow tube. The paraffin valve is a robust solid structure but the pinch-off is not strong because of the poor surface tension in the wider tube[73].

In the traditional assays with pipetting, it is easy to realize thorough mixing by vortex or sucking in and out by pipette. Indeed, in the closed type of magnetic nucleic acid assays, it will be a little difficult to realize thorough mix between magnetic particles and reaction liquids due to the gravity of the magnetic particles. Particularly, in narrow tubes, magnetic particles could not interact with samples thoroughly. In water-air passage, magnetic particles have a large specific surface area but are easily deposited in the liquids due to the gravity. To improve the mixing and capture efficiency of targets from the liquids in water-air passage, the two-magnet strategy is applied. Compared with the single-magnet strategy, the capture time of two-magnet is three times faster and the capture efficiency is 2.5 fold higher[74]. Also, the coaxial channel that can be applied to the multiring high-gradient magnetic field is designed. The coaxial channel is composed of an inner quartz capillary and an outer quartz capillary. In this situation, the magnetic particles can be captured against both walls with more uniform distribution[75]. Inspired by magnetic stirrer, we can use magnetic force, generated by electromagnet instead of permanent magnet, to promote stirring and mixing in closed type of magnetic nucleic acid assays. According to the different type of closed devices designed for nucleic acid assays, different strengths of electromagnetic force can be applied. The electromagnetic force generating device will be a very useful tool in the integrated nucleic acid assays.

Compared with integrated immunoassays, the magnetic particles assisted integrated system for nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection without pipetting is a little difficult. There are several reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to link extraction and amplification step because there is no way to transfer nucleic acids eluted from magnetic particles into amplification solution. Secondly, enzymes required for nucleic acid amplification are generally stored at low temperatures. The storage of the reagents placed in advance and the temperature control of enzymatic reactions remains to be solved. The final problems are the testing instruments and the transport of integrated devices. In the following, we will give a few examples to illustrate the above problems.",

The integrated chip is divided into DNA purification zone and digital PCR zone. In DNA purification zone, the magnetic particles in the sample lysate are captured and keep still by the magnet. The tube connected with lysis zone is pre-loaded wash buffer and PCR mix. The pre-loaded wash buffer can flow into the chamber and exclude contaminations by negative pressure from the injection syringe. Then the nucleic acids can be eluted by PCR mix and pulled into digital PCR region[81]. In this study, the role of magnetic particles is to capture and restrict target DNA in the certain chamber when the wash buffer flowing through. The negative pressure provided by the injection syringe play the main role in integrating the nucleic acid purification with amplification. The nucleic acid extraction reagents are not compatible so two steps and outlets are applied to pull the reagents. The PCR mix is comprised of RNase-free water and necessary enzymatic reaction reagents so the elution effect may not be as good as the commercial dedicated elution buffer.",

The small volume of sample is injected into the tiny tube and mixed with magnetic particles. As you can see in the (Fig. 7\n), having completed the extraction process, the eluent is directly pulled into digital PCR chip by an automatic pump. The above two methods integrated nucleic acid extraction with digital PCR. They both use negative pressure to drive liquid transfer and connect the extraction and amplification processes. However, the former uses a syringe for pipetting in the whole process and can handle larger sample volumes. The latter can just handle micro-volume samples and the automatic pump is only used in the interface for extraction and amplification.

The integrated chip combines nucleic acid extraction, digital recombinase polymerase amplification (dRPA) and fluorescence detection. As illustrated in Fig. 8\n, there are four chambers in the integrated chip. The centered one is filled with mineral oil and connected with other three uniformly distributed reagent chambers. The nucleic acids absorbed on the magnetic particles shuttle between the chambers driven by the magnet field. The screw valves can separate solution in different regions and prevent mixing. Having extracted the nucleic acids in almost 10 min, the extracted nucleic acid and mineral oil can be driven into the micro-wells ready for the digital RPA when opening the screw valves[84]. This \u2018sample in and answer out\u2019 chip provide a simple way, screw microvalve, to control the isolation and integration of extraction and amplification.

The LAMP reaction produces a superabundance of pyrophosphate, coupling this reaction with colorimetric indicators.

Different from the microfluidic chips that requires pumps or centrifuges, we stress the liquid transfer free system. Magnetic particles are good carriers for nucleic acid adsorption and transfer driven by magnetic fields. Immiscible interface can effectively separate different reaction solutions but allow magnetic particles to pass through, which creates conditions for integrated detection. In the review, we first introduce the basic information of magnetic particles, including preparation, characterization and types, which is important for the nucleic acid purification. Secondly, to explain the disadvantages of the open detection system and the advantages of the closed system, the steps of traditional open detection system are briefly described. The open nucleic acid detection system has disadvantages of complicated operation, consuming too much time, cross-contaminations, which is difficult to apply to point-of-care detection. The transport of magnetic particles assisted by immiscible interface in the closed system can avoid these problems. Then the integrated nucleic acid purification assisted by magnetic particles through water-oil interface and air-water interface is described, which lays the foundation for integrated detection. Finally, the integrated nucleic acid detection system is introduced. It greatly simplifies the steps of nucleic acid assays and promotes the integrated detection. On this basis, the improved integrated nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection system is discussed in detail.",

The existing problem is how to transfer the eluent containing nucleic acids to the amplification region. There are two solutions to the problem. One method is based on pipetting, which transfers the eluent to the amplification region by negative pressure or withdrawal of physical obstruction; The second method is to integrate the amplification solution with elution buffer, which directly transfers the magnetic particles adsorbing nucleic acids from wash buffer to the amplification solution. Both of the two points deserve further study. For point of care detection, it is better to minimize the operating steps. The reagents required for nucleic acid detection should be pre-loaded on the chips. The storage of the reagents needs to be considered. Lyophilization and chitosan encapsulation are now commonly used to store reagents. It has been shown that the reagents stored for several days behaves well. With the development of cold chain transportation, we believe that storage will not be the main problem hindering the development of POCT. Furthermore, immiscible phase assisted integrated purification and detection devices need to ensure that the solution separated by oil or air gaps should not be mixed when experiencing a certain intensity of shock during transportation.",
