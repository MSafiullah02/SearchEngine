It is intended to bring the coverage of the literature to the end of 2010. Although the intention is to be a comprehensive as possible, there is an increasing tendency to publish MALDI data in Supplementary information. Because of the ever\u2010increasing number of papers and journals, it has not been possible to check all supplementary information and, consequently, papers that do not refer to MALDI in the main text may well have been omitted. Also omitted are papers that simply report the mass of glycoproteins and those concerned with nucleotides and nucleosides: the latter compounds, although containing carbohydrates are considered to be different types of compound.",

Peptide and protein ions are then envisaged as being formed by secondary proton transfer reactions in the expanding matrix plume. This model has been checked experimentally by Hillenkamp et al. (2009) by comparing the yield of positive to negative ions of three peptides (bradykinin, angiotensin I and fibrinopeptide A) and six matrices \u03b1\u2010cyano\u20104\u2010hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA, 1/23), 2,5\u2010dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB, 1/26), 6\u2010azo\u20102\u2010thiothymine (ATT, 1/45), 4\u2010nitroaniline (4\u2010NA, 3/3), 2\u2010amino\u20105\u2010nitro\u20104\u2010picoline (ANP, 1) and 5\u2010aminoquinoline (5\u2010AQ, 2), differing in gas\u2010phase basicity by about 100 kJ/mol. It was shown that the observed ion yields cannot be explained by any single and consistent set of parameters such as gas\u2010phase basicity or acidity of the analyte and matrix. It was concluded that the existing simple model needs be modified to fully explain the experimental findings.",

In both positive and negative ion modes, matrix ions were found to appear from thin, homogeneous DHB matrix films at different threshold laser fluences. The presence of singly charged molecular matrix ions suggests that the existence of DHB ion\u2010pairs may not be a prerequisite in the MALDI process. Photoelectrons induced by the laser excitation may assist the production of negative DHB ions, as shown in experiments conducted with stainless steel and glass substrates. At high laser fluences, the relative yield of positive and negative matrix ions remained constant when homogeneous matrix films were used, but the yield fluctuated significantly with inhomogeneous crystal morphology. This result was also inconsistent with the hypothesis that matrix ion\u2010pairs are essential primary ions. Thus, results from both low and high laser fluences suggest that the production of positive and negative matrix ions in MALDI may occur via independent pathways.",

The threshold laser fluence for the ejection of photoelectrons from DHB, sinapinic acid (1/48) and 2,4,6\u2010trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP, 1/44) on stainless steel targets was found to be 0.05, 0.41, and 8.39 mJ/cm2, respectively. These values were considerably lower than those for MALDI ions, indicating that the electron detachment probably precedes other ionization reactions. The stainless steel target was thought to play an insignificant role in the production of photoelectrons because suspended DHB produced a photoelectron signal similar to DHB on the surface. In addition, decreasing the DHB thickness on the target reduced the photoelectron intensity. For crystalline DHB and sinapinic acid, the photoelectron intensity was found to increase with the laser fluence (nitrogen laser at 337 nm) in less than a second order relationship, suggesting considerable reductions of ionization potentials in comparison with free molecules. According to ab initio calculations, the ionization potential of DHB clusters was found to reduce as the cluster size increased from monomer to octamer. The paper discusses the impact of these abundant electrons on ion production in MALDI.",

The resulting positive/negative ratios of secondary analyte ions show that a recent static equilibrium approach is not adequate for quantitative analysis of MALDI experiments. Although the ion ratios remain close to unity whenever the reaction free energies are at least moderately favorable, deviations from this condition result in unequal ratios of oppositely charged ions and show once again that the dynamic aspects of MALDI cannot be neglected.",

At the same fluence, short (35 or 350 psec) pulses were found to give much higher initial pressures and ion concentrations than longer ones (3 ns). These differences were found not to persist because the system relaxes towards local thermal equilibrium on a nanosecond timescale. Higher fluences were found to accentuate the initial disparities. Axial velocities of ions and neutrals were found to span a wide range and to be fluence\u2010dependent. The total ion yield was found to be only weakly dependent on the pulse width and to be consistent with experimental estimates. Secondary reactions of matrix cations with analyte neutrals were efficient even though analyte ions were ablated in clusters of matrix (Knochenmuss & Zhigilei, 2010).",

This solid\u2010state thermodynamic interpretation was used to examine the desorption of THAP and of an angiotensin I/THAP mixture. It successfully described the changes in ion yield with the effective temperature under various laser fluence and initial temperature conditions. The analysis also revealed the key role played by ion concentration in the modeling used to provide the best fit of the model to observations. Divergence of the ion beam with laser fluence was also examined using an imaging detection method and the signal saturation normally seen at high fluence was appropriately reduced by ion focusing. Simplified but deceptive theoretical interpretations were obtained when the analysis was conducted without adequate calibration of the instrument bias.",

Thus, for every pixel position on the target, the laser spot was moved in a spiral fashion such that both Orbitrap and MS/MS data were acquired. With a fast Nd:YAG laser the data acquisition time was decreased by 43\u201349% compared to that from orbitrap\u2010only scans; however, 75% or more time could be saved for higher mass resolution and with a higher repetition rate laser.

Commercially available nano\u2010structured surfaces were used as substrates for imprinting tissue sections. The lithographic transfers were washed and the lipids were imaged by laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS). The NALDI imaging of lipid transfers was compared with standard MALDI imaging of matrix\u2010coated (CHCA) tissue sections and the resulting images were found to be of the same quality with no spatial information being lost due to the imprinting process. NALDI imaging was reported to be faster due to the absence of the time\u2010consuming matrix deposition step, and the NALDI mass spectra were less complex and easier to interpret than MALDI spectra. The method was applied to the analysis of phospholipids, GSLs and glycerophospholipids in mouse kidney slices. NALDI MS was able to identify the same lipid species as MALDI and was reported to provide better distinction between kidney and adrenal gland tissues based on the lipid analysis.",

In fact, this type of reaction can be used directly on PNGase F\u2010released N\u2010glycans because these are released in this form. Chemical formation of glycosylamines generally utilizes the Kochetkov reaction in which the glycan is treated with an excess of ammonium carbonate. Unfortunately, this reaction is slow and can take up to five days for completion. To overcome this problem, Liu, Salas\u2010Solano, and Gennaro (2009h) have used microwave assistance to speed the reaction up to as little as 90 min. Following amidation the glycans were reacted with tris\u2010(2,4,6\u2010trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium acetic acid N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide ester (36) to introduce a permanent charge on the glycan and the investigators were able to detect derivatized maltoheptaose at 2 fmol/\u00b5L by MALDI\u2010TOF MS using DHB and CHCA matrices. Glycans from RNaseB, chicken ovalbumin and asialofetuin were also detected at high sensitivity. A potential problem arises from possible cleavage of the reducing\u2010terminal N\u2010acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue as such a reaction has recently been reported as a by\u2010product of the Kochetkov reaction when, for example, ammonium bicarbonate at 37\u00b0C was used (Murase & Kajihara, 2010).",

However, sample clean\u2010up of the highly basic reaction mixtures can be a problem with, in some cases, losses offsetting any gain in sensitivity. Introduction of solid\u2010phase permethylation has improved the situation. Experimental details of the solid phase permethylation method (methyl iodide on sodium hydroxide beads) (Kang, Mechref, & Novotny, 2008; Kang et al., 2005) that is capable of permethylating very small amounts of carbohydrate have been published in Methods in Molecular Biology (Mechref, Kang, & Novotny, 2009a).

An alternative procedure for methyl ester formation that provides information on the sialic acid linkage directly from the MALDI spectrum has been published by Wheeler, Domann, and Harvey (2009) (Fig. 2). The sugars were desalted, dried, dissolved in methanol and treated with 4\u2010(4,6\u2010dimethoxy\u20101,3,5\u2010triazin\u20102\u2010yl)\u20104\u2010ethylmorpholinium chloride (DMT\u2010MM, 5/12). After removal of the solvent, the products were transferred directly to the MALDI target and examined from DHB. However, for the analysis of small amounts of N\u2010glycans derived from biological sources, the method benefited from an additional clean\u2010up stage involving the use of a Nafion 117 membrane. Unlike the reaction with methyl iodide with the sodium salt that produced a single peak from each sialylated glycan, irrespective of the linkage, the reaction with DMT\u2010MM produced different derivatives from \u03b12 \u2192 3\u2010 and \u03b12 \u2192 6\u2010linked sialic acids.

Negative ion CID mass spectra of these neutralized glycans provided information, in many cases, on the antenna of N\u2010linked glycans to which the variously linked sialic acids were attached. In an application of the method to the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen\u2010related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), it was shown that both \u03b1\u20102 \u2192 3\u2010 and \u03b1\u20102 \u2192 6\u2010linked sialic acids were present (Harvey, Baruah, & Scanlan, 2009a).",

Tajiri, Kadoya, and Wada (2009b) have recently assessed possible fucose loss and found it to be insignificant. Fucose (Fuc) is known, however, to migrate within [M+H]+ ions particularly when these are derivatized by reductive amination. Experiments on fucose loss were conducted with fucosylated glycopeptides from TF and haptoglobin. Studies with increasing collision energy on the [M+H]+ ions showed that the major fragmentation was cleavage at GlcNAc residues. Biantennary glycans containing \u03b11,3/4\u2010antenna fucose or \u03b11,6\u2010core fucose showed different fragmentation behaviors in experiments. Stability was dependent on peptide backbone sequences. Cleavage of the GlcNAc\u03b21 \u2192 2Man linkage occurred at a slightly lower activation energy than for the core fucosylated (CF) species, while the linkage of \u03b11,6\u2010core fucose was more stable than that of antenna \u03b11,3/4 fucose. However, these fragmentations only occurred at relatively high collision energy. Consequently, the authors concluded that quantitation of fucosylated glycans by MS of glycopeptides, without collisional activation, was justified. The fucosylation levels calculated from the signal intensities in nanospray ionization and UV MALDI mass spectra were essentially the same. The mass spectrometric profiling of glycopeptides from TF from patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG\u2010Ia and CDG\u2010IIc) demonstrated that the elevation or reduction of fucosylation in pathological conditions can be reliably determined by MS of glycopeptides.",

Nystose (2/11), which is chemically identical to the raftilose tetramer, was used as the internal standard.

As a result, the application of ANN led to lower quantification errors and excellent day\u2010to\u2010day repeatability compared to the conventional data analysis. This reproducibility was satisfactory for MS quantification of raftilose in the range of 10\u2013750 pg with errors below 7%.

The fragmentation was compared with fragmentation through dissociative electron attachment (DEA). Fragmentations of deprotonated monosaccharides formed in the MALDI process, as well as their transient molecular anions formed upon electron attachment, were characterized by loss of different numbers of H2O and CH2O units. Two different fragmentation pathways leading to cross\u2010ring cleavage were identified. Metastable decay of deprotonated d\u2010ribose proceeded either via an X\u2010type cleavage yielding fragment anions at m/z = 119, 100, and 89 (dominant ion, C3H5O3), or via an A\u2010type cleavage resulting in m/z = 89, 77 and 71. This result is in contrast to previous CID studies where only A\u2010type cross\u2010ring cleavage was proposed. It was found that the heavier fragment anions at m/z = 119 and m/z = 100 generated via metastable decay exclusively arise from an X\u2010type cleavage whereas the smaller fragment anions at m/z = 89 and 71 arise predominantly from an A\u2010type cleavage. A fast and early metastable cross\u2010ring cleavage of deprotonated d\u2010ribose observed in ISD was dominated by X\u2010type cleavage leading mainly to m/z = 100 and 71; the latter ion is not the same as that found in PSD. For DEA of d\u2010ribose, a sequential dissociation was identified that included metastable decay of the dehydrogenated molecular anion leading to m/z = 89. The most dominant fragment ions in DEA were due to faster decompositions occurring within several hundred nanoseconds (as in ISD) and, thus, sequential reactions including an initial dehydrogenation could be excluded.",

A range of pressures, from 0.05 to 1.8 mbar was used in combination with seven different buffer gases (He, Ne, Ar, N2, CO2, CH4, and isobutane).

For LNFP\u2010II, the yield of molecular ions rose with pressure until at the higher pressures, it was similar to that from substance P. The authors speculated that the consistently lower ion yields reported from oligosaccharides could be attributed to the generally low pressures used when recording their spectra. With respect to fragmentation, glycosidic fragment ions (termed Type I) ions dominated the spectra at low pressure but their relative abundance fell dramatically as the pressure rose. The ions resembled species that are also found in MALDI\u2010PSD MS. The abundance of type II ions, which resembled typical ISD fragments, and consisted mainly of cross\u2010ring products, rose with pressure, probably because of a reduction in the secondary fragmentation process that resulted in loss of fucose. A few other ions, termed type III ions did not show such dramatic changes with pressure. Comparing the yields of fragmentation for the different buffer gases revealed a correlation between their internal degrees of freedom and their collisional cooling efficiency. Changing the buffer gas pressure and/or extraction field provided an easy means to influence analyte ion fragmentation and to switch from the primary production of one type of fragment species to another.",

Three hundred thirty one distinct neutral compositions were obtained but many of these will represent several isomeric glycans. The smallest mass difference that was observed was 0.37 Da.

GlycoSpectrumScan uses MS rather than MS/MS data, to identify glycopeptides and determine the relative distribution of N\u2010 and O\u2010glycoforms at each site. It can be used to assign monosaccharide compositions on glycopeptides with either single or multiple glycosylation sites. The algorithm allows the input of raw mass data, including multiply charged ions, making it applicable for both ESI and MALDI data from all mass spectrometer platforms. Low resolution data from, for example, ITs are heavily smoothed to yield the average mass whereas data from high resolution instruments receive a milder smooth and deisotoping to give the monoisotopic mass.

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on which symbol to use for any particular monosaccharide with most investigators preferring to develop their own system. Several years ago, the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) attempted to redress the problem with the introduction of a system that has since been adopted by several laboratories. Unfortunately, this system has several major drawbacks: (a) it does not diagrammatically show linkage or anomericity and (b) it uses color to differentiate hexoses, thus causing problems when structures are printed in black and white and making the system difficult to use with pen or pencil on paper. A new system that overcomes these problems has recently been introduced (Harvey et al., 2009c). Monosaccharides are shown as shapes with various additions to indicate functional groups (e.g. an inclusive dot to indicate a deoxy\u2010sugar and a filled shape to code for an N\u2010acetyl sugar). Linkage is shown by the angle of the lines linking the sugar symbols and anomericity is shown by the type of line (full for a \u03b2\u2010bond and broken for an \u03b1\u2010link). Examples can be seen below. Although color is not used to define monosaccharides, the CFG colors can be used with the Oxford symbols. Unfortunately, color was omitted from the table of symbols in the original article but was published later as an erratum (Harvey et al., 2009b). The article received comments from the authors of the CFG system (Varki et al., 2009) and discussion is continuing. This scheme and others are compared in a review by Frank and Schloissnig (2010).",

Seyfried et al. (2010) have investigated the use of a high mass (HM) detector combined with a MALDI linear TOF MS system for the detection of PEGylated (glyco)proteins in the range of 60\u2013600 kDa. The system consisted of a Shimadzu AXIMA CFR+ instrument equipped with both a conventional detector and additionally, with an inline moveable HM ion conversion detector (ICD HM1, from CovalX). Spectra were run from sinapinic acid in the linear positive ion mode and were obtained from small (interferon \u03b12a), middle (HSA) and high (coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF), both heavily glycosylated proteins) molecular mass proteins. The particular challenge was the heterogeneity of the (glyco)proteins in the high MW range in combination with heterogeneity added by the PEGylation, Nevertheless, the performance of MALDI linear TOF MS was found to be superior to that of other methods. Although the SEM was able to obtain information about protein PEGylation in the mass range up to 100 kDa (e.g., PEGylated HSA), the HM system was crucial for detection of ions from the larger compounds, the masses of which sometimes exceeded 0.5 MDa. Detection of these compounds was impossible with the standard SEM. The particular challenge for the analysis was the heterogeneity of the (glyco)proteins in the high MW range in combination with additional PEGylation, which even introduced more heterogeneity and was more challenging for interpretation. Nevertheless, the performance of MALDI linear TOF MS with both detector systems in terms MW and heterogeneity determination depending on the m/z range was superior to the other methods.",

A major advantage of MALDI is that is gives a cleaner profile of glycan mixtures because of the absence of multiple charging. New techniques, such as ion mobility have emerged to complement both MALDI and electrospray but there is still much scope for improvement in carbohydrate analysis. Surveys during the review period have highlighted the fact that many laboratories still make mistakes when assigning structures. Much of this can be attributed to assumptions made between a simple mass measurement and structure, particularly when structures are selected directly from databases. At present, no one mass spectrometric technique can identify all structural features of carbohydrates. Sialylated and sulfated glycans still remain a problem although sialylated glycans can be handled after suitable derivatization, particularly by permethylation or simply by methyl ester formation. Permethylation appears to be becoming more popular, particularly for quantification and MALDI. The next few years are expected to bring many developments, particularly in instrumentation and ionization techniques, that will possibly address some of the problems with carbohydrate analysis highlighted above.",
