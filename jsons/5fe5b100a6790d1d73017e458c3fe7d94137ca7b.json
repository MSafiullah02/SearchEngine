It was soon discovered that a novel coronavirus was responsible. The novel coronavirus was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV) due to its high homology (~80%) to SARS-CoV, which caused by this virus was called Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 has been impacting a large number of people worldwide, being reported in approximately 200 countries and territories (3, 4) . As of April 7th, 2020, around 1,400,000 cases worldwide have been reported according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University (5).",

Lower respiratory tract infection related symptoms including fever, dry cough and dyspnea were reported in the initial case series from Wuhan, China (6) . In addition, headache, dizziness, generalized weakness, vomiting and diarrhea were observed (7) . It is now widely recognized that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are extremely heterogeneous, ranging from minimal symptoms to significant hypoxia with ARDS. In the report from Wuhan mentioned above, the time between the onset of symptoms and the development of ARDS was as short as 9 days, suggesting that the respiratory symptoms could progress rapidly (6) . This disease could be also fatal. A growing number of patients with severe diseases have continued to succumb worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown that mortalities are high in elder population (8) and the incidence is much lower in children (9, 10) . Current medical management is largely supportive with no targeted therapy available. Several drugs including lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin have been tested in clinical trials (8, 11, 12) , but none of them have been proven to be a definite therapy yet. More therapies are being tested in clinical trials. A large number of countries have implemented social distancing and lockdown to mitigate further spread of the virus. Here we will review our current knowledge of COVID-19 and consider the underlying mechanism to explain the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof heterogeneous symptomatology, particularly focusing on the difference between children and adult patients.",

The number of male patients was higher initially, but no significant gender difference was observed as case number increased. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days. The combined case-fatality rate was 2.3% (14, 15) . The risk factors of in-hospital death were studied using the data of two hospitals in Wuhan. Older age, higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and d-dimer > 1 \u00b5g/mL on admission were shown to be risk factors in the multi-variable analysis (8) . In the univariable analysis, the presence of coronary artery disease, diabetes and hypertension was also considered to be risk factors. The study of 85 fatal COVID-19 patients with median age of 65 years in Wuhan showed that the majority of patients died from multi-organ failure as respiratory failure, shock, and ARDS were seen in 94%, 81%, and 74% of cases, respectively (16).",

Although the Chinese series showed equal number of cases between males and females, the data suggested that more men than women suffered from severe disease and died (23, 24). The data from other countries demonstrated similar results (25). Adverse outcomes of COVID-19 were associated with comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and lung disease. These conditions are more prevalent in men and linked to smoking and drinking alcohol (25). Sex-based immunological differences were pointed out as another potential explanation (13) . In addition, the study to examine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof factors influencing the adoption of protective behaviors, specifically within the context of pandemics, found that women were about 50% more likely to practice non-pharmaceutical behaviors, suchg as hand washing, face mask use and avoiding crowds compared to men (26), which may be in part responsible. CoV-2 also bound to ACE2(31-33). ACE2 expression was high in lung, heart, ileum, kidney and bladder (34). In lung, ACE2 was highly expressed on lung epithelial cells. Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 binds to an additional target needs further investigation. Following the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the host protein, the spike protein undergoes protease cleavage. A two-step sequential protease cleavage to activate spike protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was proposed as a model, consisting of cleavage at the S1/S2 cleavage site for priming and a cleavage for activation at the S'2 site, a position adjacent to a fusion peptide within the S 2 subunit (35-37). After the cleavage at the S1/S2 cleavage site, S 1 and S 2 subunits remain noncovalently bound and the distal S 1 subunit contributes to the stabilization of the membraneanchored S 2 subunit at the prefusion state (32). Subsequent cleavage at the S'2 site presumably activates the spike for membrane fusion via irreversible, conformational changes. The coronavirus spike is unusual among viruses because a range of different proteases can cleave and activate it (38) . The characteristics unique to SARS-CoV-2 among coronaviruses is the existence of furin cleavage site (\"RPPA\" sequence) at the S1/S2 site. The S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 was entirely subjected to cleavage during biosynthesis in a drastic contrast to SARS-CoV spike, which was incorporated into assembly without cleavage (32). Although the S1/S2 site was The symptom of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from minimal symptoms to severe respiratory failure with multiple organ failure. On Computerized tomography (CT) scan, the characteristic pulmonary ground glass opacification can be seen even in asymptomatic patients (40) . Because ACE2 is highly expressed on the apical side of lung epithelial cells in the alveolar space (41, 42) , this virus can likely enter and destroy them. This matches with the fact that the early lung injury was often seen in the distal airway. Epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are three main components for innate immunity in the airway (43) . DCs These cytotoxic T cells can kill virus but also contribute to lung injury (58) . Circulating monocytes respond to GM-CSF released by these pathological T cells. CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocyte subsets, which seldom exist in healthy controls and were also found at significantly higher percentage in COVID-19 patients. These inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes had high expression of IL-6, which likely accelerated the progression of systemic inflammatory response.",

Because the recent report suggested the correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and the amount of viral loads (or the duration of virus-shedding period) (63), children may have less virus loads even if they get COVID-19.

At the early stage after birth, CD4 + T cells are impaired in production of Th1 associated proinflammatory cytokines and skewed toward Th2 (67) . CD8 + T cells reduced expression of cytotoxic and inflammatory mediators. Less killing ability by T cells at early stage after birth may explain susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in infants. The study comparing aged and young macaques infected with SARS-CoV showed that aged macaques had more robust proinflammatory responses with worse lung pathology (68) . A similar result was reported using aged and young mice infected with SARS-CoV (69) .Severe COVID-19 infection is characterized by a massive proinflammatory response or cytokine storm that results in ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction (MODS). It has been also suggested that inflammatory responses in adults and children are much different (70) . Ageing is associated with increasing proinflammatory cytokines that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f govern neutrophil functions and have been correlated with the severity of ARDS.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of ~30 kb. They infect a wide variety of host species (27). They are largely divided into four genera; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 based on their genomic structure. \u03b1 and \u03b2 coronaviruses infect only mammals (28). Human coronaviruses such as 229E and NL63 are responsible for common cold and croup and belong to\u03b1 coronavirus. In contrast, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 are classified to \u03b2 coronaviruses. The life cycle of the virus with the host consists of the following 5 steps: attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation and release. Once viruses bind to host receptors (attachment), they enter host cells through endocytosis or membrane fusion (penetration). Once viral contents are released inside the host cells, viral RNA enters the nucleus for replication. Viral mRNA is used to make viral proteins (biosynthesis). Then, new viral particles are made (maturation) and released. Coronaviruses consist of four structural proteins; Spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E) and nucleocapsid (N) (29). Spike is composed of a transmembrane trimetric glycoprotein protruding from the viral surface, which determines the diversity of coronaviruses and host tropism. Spike comprises two functional subunits; S 1 subunit is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and S 2 subunit is for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional SARS-CoV (30). Structural and functional analysis showed that the spike for SARS-",

            "text": "reside underneath the epithelium. Macrophages are located at the apical side of the epithelium.DCs and macrophages serve as innate immune cells to fight against virus es till adaptive immunity is involved.T cell mediated responses against coronaviruses have been previously reviewed(27). T cell responses are initiated by antigen presentation via DCs and macrophages. How does SARS-CoV-2 enter APCs? DCs and macrophages can phagocytize apoptotic cells infected by virus(44). For example, virus-infected apoptotic epithelial cells can be phagocytized by DCs and macrophages, which leads to antigen presentation to T cells. Or DCs and macrophages may be infected with virus primarily? Based on the Immunological Genome database (http://rstats.immgen.org), the expression of ACE2 on (splenic) dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages is present but limited (Fig. 1). Determining whether or not SARS-CoV-2 uses another protein to bind to APCs helps to answer this question. SARS-CoV can also bind to dendritic-cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR, L-SIGN) in addition to ACE2(45)(46)(47). DC-SIGN is highly expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages .Another target for SARS-CoV-2, if any, can help the virus to directly infect DCs and alveolar J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f macrophages. This needs future research. These antigen presenting cells move to the draining lymph nodes to present viral antigens to T cells. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells play a critical role. CD4 + T cells activate B cells to promote the production of virus-specific antibody, while CD8 + T cells can kill viral infected cells.Immunological studies were mainly reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients with severe diseases showed lymphopenia, particularly the reduction in peripheral blood T cells(48,49).Patients with severe diseases were reported to have increased plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1\u03b1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1(6, 48,49). The more severe conditions patients were in, the higher their IL-6 levels were. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were activated in those patients as suggested by higher expression of CD69, CD38 and CD44. Higher percentage of checkpoint receptor Tm3 + PD-1 + subsets in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells showed that T cells were also exhausted.NK group 2 member A (NKG2A), another marker for exhaustion was elevated on CD8+ T cells (3).Exhaustion of T cells could have led to the progression of the disease. Another interesting finding was that aberrant pathogenic CD4 + T cells with co-expressing interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were seen in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (48). GM-CSF production from T cells has been previously reported as a response to virus infection. GM-CSF can help to differentiate innate immune cells and augment T cell function, but it can initiate tissue damage at excess(50,51). GM-CSF + IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells were previously seen upon strong T cell receptor (TCR) responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, where CD8 + T cells expressing GM-CSF were found at higher J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f percentage and secreted IL-6. It is worth mentioning that these immunological studies were exclusively reported from adult patients. Immunological responses in pediatric population needs to be examined.The study of SARS-CoV showed that virus infected lung epithelial cells produced IL-8 in addition to IL-6 (43). IL-8 is a well-known chemoattractant for neutrophils and T cells. Infiltration of a large number of inflammatory cells were observed in the lungs from severe COVID-19 patients(52,53), and these cells presumably consist of a constellation of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells. Among innate immune cells, we expect the majority to be neutrophils .Neutrophils can act as double-edged sword as neutrophils can induce lung injury (54-56). The majority of the observed infiltrating adaptive immune cells were likely T cells, considering that the significant reduction in circulating T cells was reported. CD8 + T cells are primary cytotoxic T cells. Severe patients also showed pathological cytotoxic T cells derived from CD4+ T cells(57).",
