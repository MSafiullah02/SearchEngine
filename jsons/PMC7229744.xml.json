The number of cases might have been underestimated, possibly because asymptomatic viral carriers and patients with mild diseases have insidious or atypical symptoms and signs (WHO Collaborating Centre For Infectious Disease Modelling, 2020). The rapid outbreak worldwide could be reflected by the basic reproductive number that reached to 2.68 (Wu et al., 2020). Covid-19 is caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which potently elicits pulmonary inflammation and infiltration, as well as systemic inflammatory cytokine storms. Timely treatment is cardinal to the management of Covid-19, the adverse impacts of which has been estimated to be significantly greater than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Yang et al., 2020).",

Development of a novel class of medication would not be practical within a short span during the public emergency event such as Covid-19. In light of the long history of evolution and the proven efficacy in patients with influenza (Duan et al., 2011), the traditional Chinese medicine has recently been repurposed for the clinical management of Covid-19 (Xia et al., 2020). Several candidates with possible antiviral effects have been explored (Wang et al., 2020). In the latest publication, Lianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule (Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Shijiazhuang, China) was a manufactured product of the traditional Chinese medicine formula marketed in China that could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, alter the viral morphology and confer anti-inflammatory activity in vitro (Li et al., 2020). Moreover, LH capsules could significantly ameliorate the cardinal symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, fatigue) and shorten the course of Covid-19 (Cheng and Li, 2020; Lu et al., 2020). According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial version 7) (Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Coronavirus Pneumonia. 2020), LH capsule has been endorsed by the National Health Commission for the treatment of Covid-19. However, no existing study has been conducted with a sufficient sample size and prospective randomized designs in multicenter settings.",

In light of the lack of validated effective therapeutic approaches, the medications that could ameliorate fever, fatigue and coughing would be valuable for the clinical management of Covid-19. LH capsules, which is a patented product, have been marketed since the outbreak of SARS in 2003 in China. The latest research showed that LH conferred suppression of the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and reduced the viral loads in the cytoplasm and cellular membrane (Li et al., 2020). LH could also suppress the replication of SARS-CoV (Zhu et al., 2003), H3N2, H1N1 and H7N9\nin vitro (Chinese Academy Of Military Hospital, 2009; Ding et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2011; Mo et al., 2007). The inflammatory cytokine storm has been regarded as an excessive host-defense response to the virus (Xu et al., 2020; Zhe Xu, 2020), which can cause diffuse lung injury and predispose to the development of severe disease. Suppression of excessive release of inflammatory meditators is the Holy Grail for halting the progression to severe disease (Xu et al., 2020). Recent studies indicated that LH could dose-dependently inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, macrophage chemokine protein-1 and induced protein-10 (Li et al., 2020), and could also effectively abrogate the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 (Mo et al., 2007), thus ameliorating lung injury associated with inflammatory cell infiltration (Cui et al., 2015). These in vitro findings have provided with the rationale for clinical application of LH capsules in Covid-19.",

The time to symptom recovery was also significantly shorter in treatment group. Overall, LH capsules have shortened the duration of fever, fatigue and coughing by 1, 3 and 3 days, respectively. The higher rate of clinical cure and recovery of chest CT manifestations could also be associated with the activity against SARS-CoV-2, and probably, the anti-inflammatory effects. There was a lack of statistical significance for the difference in the rate of, and the time to, conversion of viral assays. These findings differed from those in the in vitro studies (Li et al., 2020), possibly because of the difference in the model for observation (human vs. cell models) and the study endpoints (changes in the viral loads in human respiratory tract specimens vs. viral loads in the cytoplasm in vitro). No serious adverse events were reported, supporting the safety of LH capsules for the treatment of Covid-19.",

Rhodiola rosea could ameliorate lung injury via the suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis (HuangFu et al., 2019) and abrogation of pulmonary inflammation (Yao and Luo, 2020). In addition, Rheum palmatum could effectively antagonize the binding of spike protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme (Ho et al., 2007) and suppress the excessive release of inflammatory mediators, thus ameliorating the lung injury (Dong et al., 2017). These observations have provided the evidence regarding the antiviral effects of LH capsules.",

Our findings indicated that LH capsules could be recommended to patients with Covid-19 for reducing the symptom burden and improving clinical outcomes. However, there are some limitations of the study design. No blinding was implemented because of the urgency of the outbreak that entailed a timely treatment, and placebo-controlled trial would be unethical in light of the rapid outbreak of communicable diseases such as Covid-19. The duration of treatment was established empirically, and whether a prolonged duration would translate into the greater efficacy warrants further investigation. An extended study would be needed to thoroughly explore the effects of LH capsules on the viral shedding and the resolution of all symptoms.",
