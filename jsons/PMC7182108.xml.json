Bats have greatly elongated digits that support the wing membrane, which is an extension of the skin of the dorsum and ventrum (Fig. 25.1\n) (Nowak, 1999). In pteropodid bats, the first digit is opposable, but it is largely or completely fixed in most of the remaining bat species (Altringham, 1996). The first digit has a claw in all bats, and the second one also has a claw in most pteropodid bats (Nowak, 1999, Vaughan, 1970). The hind limbs are rotated 90\u2013180 degrees so that the stifle bends laterally or dorsolaterally (Altringham, 1996, Neuweiler, 2000). The radius is markedly elongated, longer than the humerus. The ulna is generally small, with the distal portion greatly reduced or absent (Vaughan, 1970, Walton and Walton, 1970). The fibula is often small and sometimes incomplete, and it is absent entirely in the family Nycteridae (Walton and Walton, 1970). The uropatagium is present between the hind limbs. The anatomy of this membrane varies between species, from a single membrane that completely spans the hind limbs to narrow strips of membrane on the medial aspect of the hind limbs (Schutt and Simmons, 1998). A bony or cartilaginous structure called the calcar, associated with the first row of tarsal bones, helps spread and support the uropatagium (Schutt and Simmons, 1998, Walton and Walton, 1970). The calcar generally articulates with the calcaneal tuberosity in most bat species but lacks this articulation in pteropodid bats; examined species of rhinopomatid and craseonycterid bats, as well as some phyllostomid and pteropodid bats, lack a calcar (Schutt and Simmons, 1998).",

The epidermis typically ranges from 1 to 3 cells thick and the stratum corneum is relatively thick in comparison to the epidermis. Melanocytes are present within and immediately subjacent to the epidermis and melanin granules can be found throughout all layers of the epidermis and stratum corneum (Makanya and Mortola, 2007, Quay, 1970). The superficial dermis is composed primarily of collagen with few elastic fibers, while the deep dermis contains dense bundles of elastic fibers (Holbrook and Odland, 1978). Only rare hair follicles and sebaceous glands are present in the patagia (Gupta, 1967). Musculature within the wing membrane includes large skeletal muscles that connect the skeleton to the wing membrane, as well as intrinsic muscles that originate and insert within the wing membrane itself (Swartz et al., 1996).",

            "text": "In general, bats have a short gastrointestinal (GI) tract and rapid GI transit time, likely an adaptation for flight (Strobel et al., 2015). The stomachs are relatively simple in insectivorous bats but may be larger and more complex in some frugivorous and nectarivorous bats (Stevens and Hume, 1995). The stomach of Desmodus rotundus is elongated and tubular; the cardiac portion forms a blind sac for blood stoage (Greenhall et al., 1983, Stevens and Hume, 1995). The stomachs of multiple described pteropodid frugivorous (Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus, Rousettus leschenaulti, Epomophorus wahlbergi) and nectarivorous (Eonycteris spelaea) species have an elongated fundic cecum (Bhide, 1980, Perrin and Hughes, 1992, Tedman and Hall, 1985). A fundic cecum is not described in Eidolon helvum, so it does not appear to be a universal feature of pteropodids (DeFrees and Wilson, 1988, Okon, 1977). The intestine of bats is relatively short and generally lacks a cecum. Therefore, there is often no grossly discernible transition between the large and small intestine, although an increase in diameter may be present at the junction, or longitudinal folds may be present in the colon (Gadelha-Alves et al., 2008, Okon, 1977, Stevens and Hume, 1995). A few species, including Megaderma spasma and Rhinopoma hardwickii, have a cecum (Stevens and Hume, 1995).",

Overload is likely dietary, although the reason for the susceptibility of this species relative to other species on the same diet is unclear. Excess iron participates in the generation of free radicals, resulting in tissue damage (Takami and Sakaida, 2011). The liver is the primary target organ with excessive iron observed in portal macrophages, Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, as well as fibroblasts and bile duct epithelium. With chronicity, bats can develop portal to bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Fig. 25.5\n). Icterus and cavitary effusions can occur with liver failure (Crawshaw et al., 1995). Excessive iron stores are also identified in the spleen, and iron deposition has also been identified in the heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, kidneys, and various other tissues. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma can be seen in R. aegyptiacus with liver damage associated with IO. Myocardial degeneration and/or fibrosis is also common in R. aegyptiacus with IO (occur in about 45% of affected bats) but it is not correlated with the amount of iron present in the liver or heart (Leone et al., 2016). Myocardial fibrosis is also observed in older fruit bats of other species, albeit at a lower rate than R. aegyptiacus. It is not known whether myocardial fibrosis is related to IO or is simply common in this species, as a significant number of R. aegyptiacus without IO have not been examined. Iron overload with hepatic fibrosis has also been observed in R. lanosus. While other fruit bats including Pteropus spp. (Crawshaw et al., 1995), Carollia perspicillata, and Cynopterus brachyotis have been observed with varying amounts of hepatic iron, associated damage has not been identified.",

Lipid and fatty acid concentrations in the myelin of B12-deficient bats were subsequently determined to be different than in control bats; bats in this study were fed washed, peeled banana and papaya with a supplement containing vitamins A, C, and D and four B complex vitamins (B6, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin) (van der Westhuyzen et al., 1983). However, it should be noted that the experimental diets were likely deficient in multiple nutrients, including vitamin E, so reported nervous system lesions could have been the result of deficiencies other than vitamin B12 (E. Dierenfeld, personal communication).",

Hepatic, renal tubular, and cardiomyocyte lipidosis with patagial ecchymoses, perirenal hemorrhage, and icterus has also been reported in a captive colony of Eptesicus fuscus secondary to decreased food intake associated with environmental disturbance, illness, and conspecific trauma (Snyder et al., 2015).

Insectivorous bats are thought to be particularly susceptible to organochlorine exposure due to their higher trophic level in food webs, high metabolic rate, and long life span, as well as the periodic mobilization of adipose tissue during migration and hibernation, at which time lipophilic compounds stored in fat are released (Geluso et al., 1976). Due to their propensity to roost in manmade structures, bats are often exposed to antifungal and insecticide compounds in treated lumber. Bats of all life stages are at risk for intoxication, as some organochlorine pesticides have been shown to cross through the placenta and pass to young in milk (Clark and Shore, 2001).",

Migratory species that roost in trees are disproportionately affected, although high mortality can occur in nonmigratory species (Cryan and Barclay, 2009, Grodsky et al., 2011). Barotrauma was initially proposed as the cause of death in many bats due to reports of intrathoracic and intra-abdominal hemorrhage with a relative lack of external injuries. Other findings supportive of barotrauma included pulmonary lesions such as alveolar bullae, hemorrhage, congestion, edema, and atelectasis (Baerwald et al., 2008). Subsequent studies have concluded that injuries are more compatible with blunt trauma (Fig. 25.7\n). Commonly cited injuries include wing fractures, external lacerations, inguinal and diaphragmatic hernias, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and bone marrow emboli, although rupture of the tympanic membrane in the absence of associated mechanical injuries has been reported in a small subset (6%) of affected bats (Grodsky et al., 2011, Rollins et al., 2012). It is likely that both blunt force trauma and decompression play a role in wind turbine-related bat mortality (see Chapter 2).",

A high seroprevalence rate has been detected in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that they may be able to survive infection (Allendorf et al., 2012). Bats typically undergo a 2\u201325 week incubation period, although prolonged incubation of over 1 year has been reported (Brass, 1994). Cold temperatures inhibit disease progression in cold-adapted (i.e., hibernating) bats (Constantine and Blehert, 2009). Virus may be present in saliva for up to 12\u201315 days before onset of clinical signs, and most bats die within 1\u20132 weeks of developing clinical signs (Constantine and Blehert, 2009, Heard, 2003). Although direct contact with saliva, as through a bite wound, is typically required for transmission, both bats and humans can be infected by aerosolized virus (Constantine, 1993, Davis et al., 2007).",

In a report of rabies infection in five Molossus molossus in Brazil found during the day unable to fly, the presence of rabies virus was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, direct immunofluorescence, and mouse inoculation. However, no microscopic lesions were present, indicating that lack of histologic lesions may not rule out lyssaviral infection in bats (de Ara\u00fajo et al., 2014). Neuronal intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies known as Negri bodies are typical, but their presence and frequency are highly variable.

Although a histologic review of naturally infected bats has not been performed, experimental inoculation of A. jamaicensis and Carollia perspicillata with Tacaribe virus resulted in multisystemic lesions including interstitial pneumonia, hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, neutrophilic splenitis, and lymphocytic leptomeningitis or encephalitis. Development of significant clinical disease in these species may suggest they are unlikely to be reservoirs for Tacaribe virus (Cogswell-Hawkinson et al., 2012).",

By 2018, WNS had spread north into Canada, south to Alabama, as far west as central Kansas, and had been detected in a single bat in western Washington (www.whitenosesyndrome.org/resources/map), demonstrating the potential of the introduced fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus (Geomyces) destructans (Pd) to impact bat populations across North America (Lorch et al., 2016). Certain hibernating North American bat species have been disproportionately affected, while others appear refractory to the disease. Particularly susceptible species include Myotis lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and Perimyotis subflavus (Frank et al., 2014). M. lucifugus, once the most populous species of bat in the Eastern United States, has undergone significant population declines and localized extirpation with complete loss of populations in some affected caves (Frick et al., 2010).",

The fungus\u2019s ability to persist in cave sediment in the absence of living hosts is likely to be an important factor for perpetuation of the infection (Reynolds et al., 2015). Bats are thought to become transiently infected in autumn, with transmission increasing throughout winter. Infection peaks in late winter but is cleared in summer in surviving bats, with zero prevalence reported in summer months (Langwig et al., 2015). However, the fungus may still be present in the summer months on the skin of bats that utilize contaminated underground sites for daily torpor (Ballmann, et al., 2017). The growth range of Pd corresponds to the body temperature of most hibernating bats (Verant et al., 2012), and hibernation and the associated decrease in body temperature during periods of torpor have proven to be significant in the pathogenesis of WNS.",

The area of skin examined microscopically can be maximized by rolling excised portions of the patagia onto wax dowels which are then cut transversely, resulting in multiple cross sections of concentric rolls of skin (Fig. 25.15\n) (Meteyer et al., 2009). Pathognomonic lesions include cupping erosions and ulcers filled with densely packed, PAS- and GMS-positive fungal hyphae with variable extension through the basement membrane (Fig. 25.16\n). Hyphae commonly extend into hair follicles and sebaceous or apocrine glands. In tissue section, fungal hyphae exhibit mild morphological variability. Hyphae are septate and branching, with parallel to slightly irregular walls 2\u20135\u03bcm in diameter. Conidia, when present, are curved and measure \u223c2.5 \u03bcm wide \u00d7 7.5 \u03bcm long (Fig. 25.16A) (Meteyer et al., 2009). The lack of inflammatory response to the invading hyphae is typical of the lesion in hibernating bats. However, neutrophilic inflammation can occur in hibernating bats when the fungal lesion is superinfected with bacteria (Courtin et al., 2010;\nMeteyer et al., 2009). Bats that have emerged from hibernation may exhibit a neutrophilic response to Pd (Fig. 25.17\n), as well as edema and necrosis that are not present in hibernating bats (Meteyer et al., 2011, Meteyer et al., 2012).",

Organisms are most often present in pulmonary alveolar macrophages but can also be found in circulating macrophages and in the mesentery, spleen, liver, adrenal gland, and intestine (Taylor et al., 1999, Tesh and Schneidau, 1966). There is typically minimal to no cellular response to infection, which is thought to occur by the respiratory route with infective fungi being excreted in feces (McMurray and Greer, 1979, Taylor et al., 1999). There are no reports of mortality due to natural infections in free-ranging bats (Greer and McMurray, 1981). The ability of bats to survive disseminated infection, including intestinal infection with shedding of spores, likely allows them to serve as reservoirs. During an outbreak at the Houston Zoo, USA, 12 Rousettus aegyptiacus and one Artibeus jamaicensis had systemic histoplasmosis. The lung was a primary site of infection in all cases except 4 R. aegyptiacus (Tocidlowski, 2003).",

In adult bats, third stage larvae are present in the liver, as well as the mammary gland of lactating females that pass the larvae to suckling bats via transmammary transmission. Adult nematodes are normally only identified in the intestine of juvenile bats (Prociv, 1983). However, they can occasionally be seen in other sites and in other age classes of bats. They have been described in the gall bladder, common bile duct, esophagus, and pharynx/larynx, and a large number of nematodes in the stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum were associated with small intestinal volvulus in a young P. conspicillatus. Aberrant larval migration has also occasionally been reported (Prociv, 1983, Prociv, 1990). In free-ranging bats, large numbers of intestinal nematodes can be negatively correlated with body condition, and volvulus, intussusception and possible partial intestinal obstruction have been observed in some infected bats (Karawita et al., 2017). Failure to thrive may occasionally be observed in hand-reared Pteropus spp. with heavy ascarid loads (Olsson and Woods, 2008).",

(Gruber et al., 1996, Kusewitt et al., 1977, W\u00fcnschmann et al., 2010). Early reports in M. sodalis presumptively identified the coccidia morphologically as Klossiella sp. (Kusewitt et al., 1977). The name Nephroisospora eptesici has been proposed for the organism in E. fuscus (W\u00fcnschmann et al., 2010). White foci up to 2 mm diameter may be visible on the renal capsular surface (Fig. 25.20\nA). Microscopically, the lesion is similar to that caused by Eimeria stiedae in the bile ducts of rabbits. Tubules, particularly those in the deep cortex and medulla, are markedly dilated with hypertrophic and hyperplastic epithelium. Epithelial cells contain asexual and sexual stages of the organism, and tubular lumina contain schizonts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and sporulated and unsporulated oocysts (Fig. 25.20B) (Gruber et al., 1996, W\u00fcnschmann et al., 2010). Eosinophilic, histiocytic, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation may occur but is rare. There has been no evidence of clinically significant impairment of renal function. Marked cystic tubular dilation distinguishes renal coccidiosis of bats from that of waterfowl, amphibians, and other species (Gruber et al., 1996). Moreover, the entire life cycle is thought to be completed in a single host without requiring sporogony in the environment (W\u00fcnschmann et al., 2010).",

Three spontaneously died and one was euthanized within 48 hours of ivermectin administration, one died 7 days after administration, and the other six bats recovered. Three bats that died within 48 hours of ivermectin administration had renal tubular necrosis with regeneration, and the bat that died after 7 days had suppurative bronchopneumonia. As tubular necrosis has not been reported with ivermectin toxicosis except in humans with onchocerciasis, the cause of the tubular necrosis was not determined (DeMarco et al., 2002). Additionally, tubular regeneration would not be expected for a toxic insult within 48 hours, so renal lesions may have been unrelated to ivermectin toxicosis. Bronchopneumonia may have been a result of aspiration due to neurologic weakness in one bat.",

Clinical signs in free-ranging bats include incoordination, inability to fly, aggression, muscle tremors, ptyalism, and ataxia, while captive bats were found separated from the group and were subjects of conspecific aggression. Histologic lesions include renal tubular necrosis, proximal tubular karyomegaly and nuclear pleomorphism, and variably acid fast, eosinophilic proximal renal tubular and hepatic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Hariono et al., 1993, Skerratt et al., 1998, Sutton and Wilson, 1983, Zook et al., 1970). Concurrent lyssaviral infection was diagnosed in one free-ranging P. alecto with signs of aggression and cytoplasmic neuronal brainstem inclusions but no encephalitis (Skerratt et al., 1998). The source of lead was thought to be paint in captive bats (Zook et al., 1970) and environmental in free-ranging Australian Pteropus spp. that had lead in fur washings (Hariono et al., 1993).",
