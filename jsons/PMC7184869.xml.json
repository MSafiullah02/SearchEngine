            "text": "I utilized this assignment in my social studies methods course as well as in various undergraduate and doctoral history of education courses. There were only five students in my methods course which made for a more intimate setting. I used an excerpt from Maus and from Barefoot Gen. First I assigned Maus and we discussed our interpretations as a class so students could understand the process of closure. Next I assigned a page from Barefoot Gen (a survivor\u2019s tale of Hiroshima) and had them go through the questions on the assignment. One group of students had very different interpretations of the excerpt from Barefoot Gen, and the other group had similar ones. I worked with the remaining student, and both she and I brought very different interpretations to the text. Some of the differences for both excerpts were: some students \u201cheard\u201d sounds such as the whistle of the bomb or the eerie silence after the gas did its work. Some students did not hear them. One student thought about her own children and what she would have done in the gas chamber. Some students thought of Hollywood movies they had seen which depicted the gas chambers and the nuclear explosions to help them see the image. An older student remembered the palpable and very real fear of nuclear holocaust she experienced in the 1980s, while I remembered my grandfather\u2019s description of the shadow imprints of human beings that he saw when he was stationed in Hiroshima in the 1950s. I used this assignment to get my students to think about how different individuals interpret the same historical events. I think closure is well suited to facilitate this discussion. I was also very pleased when a student referenced this activity later on to show how different people process the same event. We bring our own ideas, experiences, and background knowledge to the comics page (Duncan et al., 2015) and this was on full display during our activity and class discussion.",

Cohn (2018, 2) asserts: \u201cthis \u2018narrative grammar\u2019 gives categorical roles to visual image units, and then organizes those units into hierarchic constituents.\u201d Cohn asserts that a basic set of panels are establisher, initial, peak, and release panels. Establishers begin a sequence but are passive, initials start the action, peaks are the action, and release \u201creleases the tension\u201d (Cohn, 2018, 2\u20133). The meaning produced relies on the combinations, but is also affected by the content as well (Cohn, 2013, 73). Further, more complex types of combinations of panels are called arcs and work to advance complex stories. So, for example, Cohn (2018, 3) illustrates an arc with a larger initial and peak, but the larger initial is composed of an initial and peak panel, and the larger peak is composed of an establisher, initial, peak, and release. While Cohn (2013, 2) likens comics to a language, he stresses however that \u201ccomics are not a language,\u201d but created with language (Cohn, 2013).",

Moreover, I find teaching teachers and how to teach citizenship in hyperreality is even more difficult. One useful method I have found to convey these ideas to my prospective social studies teachers is through the use of skills and dispositions. Cohen, Pickeral, and Levine (2010) and Torney-Purta and Vermeer Lopez (2006) argue that citizens need certain skills and dispositions. Larson (2017, 8) asserts that a disposition can be thought of asthe \u201cattitudes or mindsets that students need to learn.\u201d Banks and colleagues (1999) similarly argue that citizens need knowledge, skills, values, and to take action. Banks and colleagues (1999) do note however that many times values can conflict (e.g., freedom and equality). Banks and colleagues (1999, 435) also note the difference between values and attitudes. They describe values as more general and \u201cnot related to any specific things, persons, or groups.\u201d Importantly, the questions of what skills and dispositions are needed depend on the type of society that is desired (Cohen et al., 2010). Moreover, Cohen and colleagues (2010) drawing off Westheimer and Kahne\u2019s (2004) tension between different types of citizenship, assert that it is difficult to create a totalizing vision of citizenship. Rather, there should be deliberation about what constitutes good citizenship and this should be kept in mind when discussing skills and dispositions (Cohen et al., 2010).",

The use of comics and graphic novels in the social studies, and in a variety of different K-12 and college classes may be able to help with this task. While I do not reference skills and dispositions in every single assignment in this book, I think all of the exercises necessitate certain stills and dispositions, and teachers and professors can highlight, refine and work toward these as they utilize the assignments in this book. Torney-Purta and Vermeer Lopez\u2019s (2006, 4) notion of \u201cthe braid\u201d is important as well: knowledge, skills, and dispositions must be \u201cequal in importance and connected to one another.\u201d This equivalence depicted with an interlocking braid of three strands, where each strand represents either knowledge, skills, or dispositions.",

I gave them excerpts from The Killing Joke, the Walking Dead, Maus, and a comic dealing the Slavery and the Civil War. The students used the framework to analyze the excerpts. The framework generated some great conversation about how the features of the comics medium interacted with citizenship ideas, as well as how these were portrayed visually.

This comic is a rematch of Superman and his archnemesis Doomsday, who had killed him years before in the famous Death of Superman comic. Both Superman and Doomsday returned to life. This comic gives Doomsday\u2019s harrowing back story. Scientists deposit a baby out in the harsh environment to watch the baby die. They collect the remains, use the genetic material, and create a new baby to repeat this process. The purpose of the grisly experiment is to create a perfect being, one that cannot be killed. The scientists succeed, only to be killed by their own creation. I believe this scene could be related to citizenship questions. When I read this, I wanted to know what else these scientists were thinking. What values and dispositions did these scientists hold? What did they go home and say to their wives and husbands about their work? Was this rationalized in the name of progress and science? What would an outsider think of this? How did the art and features of the comics medium help to convey this story in ways that text alone could accomplish? A student could be asked to reconstruct a scene like this. A nonfiction comic could be used as well. For instance, students can be asked to think about what more information they would like to know about abolitionists or what Abe Lincoln was thinking to himself or told his wife in moments not shown in the comics. The questions of what is not known or cannot be seen in the comic can be an important process for grappling with citizenship.",

Some students felt a little bewildered and were unsure of what I was asking. I learned I need to be clear on these types of assignments. However, overall I was pleased. I had a class of about 18 students and had them work in groups of two to four people. I made sure to talk with each group privately, and then hold a class discussion. I believe this way generates more discussion because people may not open up in front of a class, but people may open up in small groups. We discussed what a VOR is and how it may be created. Admittedly, I stacked the deck a little by selecting two episodes (The US Civil War and the Civil Rights movement) which had an obvious and deadly clash of values (I also considered using Maus, but wanted to introduce the students to some comic\u2019s series they may not have been familiar with). But that was the point. I wanted students to see this clash, not just read about it. I also felt that the VOR assignment aligned with the fourth NCSS theme of identity development. When I spoke with students in their groups, and then in the overall class discussion, we were able to theorize about the VOR\u2019s of the different characters and groups in the excerpts (e.g., Civil Rights protestors and Southern police forces, or Northern and Southern armies) and how sequential art helped to depict some of these ideas. I also drew a portion of my own VOR to show the class what I wanted them to do. I believe this example helped tremendously.",

Specifically, we read about ELL and refugee students and students with epilepsy and the psychological concerns of educating each group. The two graphic novels I chose were Epileptic, by David B., and Illegal by Chris Coffer. Epileptic centers on the story of David, whose brother is an epileptic, and the trials his family faces because of his brother\u2019s illness (Wolk, 2007). Illegal centers on the story of a young boy and his brother who are trying to escape an African nation and make it to Europe. While these topics were specific to my Human Development and Learning course, they nevertheless could be a bridge to wider topics, such as racism, ethnocentrism, and disability. The attitudes we hold toward other people and the actions we take, the ideas we hold about ourselves resulting from our own cultural orientations, and the way we interact with others are psychological and citizenship questions. As pointed out in the introduction, some excellent work has been done on related topics such as disability in comics (Whalen, Foss, & Gray, 2016), cultural concerns, and stereotypes in comics (Cook & Frey, 2017; Dong, 2013) to name a few examples.",

Myths can explain the reasons for things, justify a condition, show people how to act, or warn people about something. Later scholars such as Freud and Jung saw myths as psychological phenomena. For Freud, myths become the \u201ccollective dreams of the human race,\u201d and Jung saw myths as containing \u201carchetypes or recurrent images that exist cross culturally and throughout time\u201d (Vandiver, 2000a, 39). Vandiver (2000a) argues that while all of these theories have something useful to offer, they all may be lacking as well. Instead, she uses the theories above as tools to understand myths when appropriate (Vandiver, 2000a).

Vandiver (2000b) argues that we now see our heroes in the future. She (2000a, b) notes that these characters are not our ancestors. Rather, they are our descendants. Modern audiences may also now have a familiarity with 2500 years of myths.

Another question we must ask ourselves is what is the relation of ancient myths, modern mythmaking in comics\u2019 form, and the hyperreal? If you have been paying attention this far, this question cuts to the heart of this book. Both existing myths and the creation of new myths can be important devices in hyperreality. Citizens can examine some of the ideas behind existing myths and the mythmaking impulse to truly understand myth and how to utilize them in hyperreality. The directions call for students to think critically about how the comics medium helps to convey important information in different and unique ways (e.g., multilinearity, word balloons).",

Myths are possessed by all cultures (Vandiver, 2000a). Teachers can link the study of traditional myths (which as noted above is usually on a variety of state curriculums) to the mythmaking impulse that is still alive and well, albeit which may look a little different. Below are assignments in which students analyze the traditional myths as well as modern myths found in comics. Students then compare them to ancient myths using Vandiver\u2019s (2000a, b) ideas. As with most of the assignments in this book, the teacher will have to decide on certain parameters. The most obvious one is whose mythology to study. In my own experience from teaching Ancient World History, I had to cover Sumerian, Egyptian, Greco-Roman, and Aztec mythology. So, for simplicities sake, let\u2019s stay with Greco-Roman myths. Another consideration is graphic adaptations of myths. Certain myths are now in graphic novel form. Gareth Hinds has created an excellent adaption of Beowulf and The Odyssey. Carter (2011) argues that examining the same story in two different mediums can lead to fruitful discussions about different choices different creators make in the different renditions of the story. Following this, I have students looking at the same story in different mediums ( graphic novel and traditional print text). Obviously, not all myths are in graphic novel form so the first assignment can only be done with graphic adaptations. Teachers will also have to decide how much of a story (both the traditional myths and the comics) students will read. Finally, teachers will have to give some instruction on Vandiver\u2019s (2000a, b) ideas (Table 2.3).\n",

Halsall (2018) argues for reading classic texts alongside of graphic novels. Halsall (2018, 93) notes: \u201cA graphic novel thus possesses a crossover ability to inspire deep and passionate responses from readers in the reading of canonical classics.\u201d Halsall (2018) had students look at a traditional version of the Odyssey and Frank Miller\u2019s 300, two different stories. The assignment below has students looking at a traditional story, such as the Odyssey, and a modern myth that either students or teacher and students as a class identify as such. An excellent starting point may be Robert Kirkman\u2019s The Walking Dead which I use as an example. Of course all stories may not be suitable for some students, so teachers could adjust as necessary. Portions of The Walking Dead are definitely not suitable for high school students. This exercise could also be done in conjunction with the above exercise or as a standalone exercise. I have also added a question on heroes. As Vandiver (2000b) notes, the heroes of ancient myths are not always good or morally upstanding, in fact many commit some terrible actions. One conception of hero just entails that a person has done extraordinary, and not necessarily, good, things (Vandiver, 2000b). Negan, a dictator type in this post-apocalyptic world in the Walking Dead series, may be considered a type of a hero. Even Rick, the protagonist, does some very questionable things. Deciding who is a hero can be a fruitful exercise not just for the text, but also from a social studies standpoint. There are many people in the past who may have done extraordinary, but morally questionable acts. Students can get their hands dirty with this question. The last column on the chart links this exercise back to the traditional (and usually curriculum based) study of myth. Teachers may want to give students time to complete this individually, in groups and then as a class discussion led by the teacher (Table 2.4). In addition, I assigned a variation of the assignment below to my own children when I homeschooled them during the COVID-19 crisis.\n",

The left side of the chart calls for students to write about what they learned on a topic. The middle column has students compare this with a comic. So, if students are given a lecture and some worksheets pertaining to the Holocaust, the next week they can read selections of Maus.

The last column specifically pertains to the comics medium and forces students to consider how the comics medium differs from traditional text.
