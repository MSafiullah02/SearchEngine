All subjects had developed rashes on the hand, foot, and mouth. For each of these patients, enterovirus virus infection with hand, foot, and mouth disease was suspected. Each subject underwent chest radiography and a routine physical examination at admission. Blood cell counts, blood gas levels, and biochemical factors, such as glucose level, creatinine level, urea nitrogen level, and hemoglobin level, were assessed. CSF samples were obtained and used to determine protein concentration and WBC count. Swab samples from the throat, rectum, and vesicles were obtained. Neurological and respiratory signs were observed. During episodes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), AP and HR were continuously monitored with use of a polygraph and a tape recorder, allowing a retrospective analysis of AP and HR variability [4, 7] . Consent for autopsy of patients who died of acute PE was obtained from the patients themselves (in 4 cases) or from their relatives. Postmortem specimens obtained from the brain and lungs were examined for pathological lesions. RT-PCR was used for detection of iNOS mRNA expression in the lungs. RT-PCR was performed according to the manufacture's instructions (Alpha-Innotech). Consent for autopsy of patients who died of acute pulmonary edema was obtained from the patients themselves or from their relatives.

After receipt of intensive care and respiratory therapy over a period of 8 days, the symptoms gradually subsided in 27 of the patients (15 male and 12 female patients). Twenty-one patients (14 male and 7 female patients) developed severe dyspnea, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and decreased blood oxygen partial pressure. AP and HR fluctuation ensued. In these 21 patients, frothy pink secretions (and even fresh blood) was expelled from the endotracheal tube. Each of these 21 patients died within 4 h after the development of ARDS.

            "text": "Before the onset of ARDS, the patient's AP and HR were within normal limits. Later, the AP and HR (the reverse of the R-R interval) increased and fluctuated. Before death, there was a dramatic decrease in AP and HR. The patient's blood glucose level \u202b\u05e2(\u202c SE) was mmol/L at admission. Hypergly-7.6 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0.4 cemia (blood glucose level \u202b\u05e2\u202c SE, mmol/L) devel-26.7 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 2.5 oped. At admission, the patient's WBC count \u202b\u05e2\u202c SE was 15.6 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 3.2 \u03eb 10 9 cells/L. An elevated WBC count (WBC count \u202b\u05e2\u202c SE, 48.6 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 9.4 \u03eb 10 9 cells/L) was noted at the onset of ARDS. In samples of the CSF, WBC count and protein concentration were cells/L and mg/dL, respectively. Discussion. Our laboratory has performed a series of studies on the mechanisms of acute PE induced by cerebral compression or increased intracranial pressure [3, [11] [12] [13] . The PE associated with ARDS is usually fatal. In brief, central sympathetic overactivation produces systemic hypertension and vasoconstriction. These changes cause a shift of the blood to the pulmonary circulatory system [3] . We extended the study from animals to human subjects. Acute PE can be induced in rare cases of Japanese B encephalitis, fat embolism, breast cancer with lymphangitis, and rupture of intracranial aneurysm [14] . The lesions in the CNS following EV71 infection that were observed in the current study matched those that we have previously observed in patients who died of Japanese B encephalitis [14] . In a recent review article [13] , we described and discussed early and recent studies of ARDS in animals and humans and recommended further studies on the mechanism, prevention, and treatment of ARDS in the clinical practice of intensive care. The present study also supports the contention that hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and elevated protein levels in CSF are risk factors for the development of ARDS due to en- terovirus infection [1, 2] . The relationship between hyperglycemia and ARDS remains an interesting topic for future study.",

            "text": "Our research demonstrated enhanced iNOS mRNA expression in the hemorrhagic lung. The increase in iNOS expression does not definitely indicate that nitric oxide formation is detrimental to the lung. Our previous studies [15, 16] found that exogenous and endogenous nitric oxide were toxic to the lung in cases of sepsis and of ischemia and reperfusion. Therefore, nitric oxide production may be responsible for the pathogenesis of ARDS due to EV71 infection, and selective iNOS blockers may be therapeutic agents for ARDS induced by EV71 or by other viral infections. In the present report, we did not measure the pulmonary AP, which was demonstrated to be high during the development of PE [3, 11, 14, 16] . It is well known that nitric oxide exerts vasodilatory effects in various vascular beds. The production of nitric oxide through iNOS could reduce pulmonary hypertension. On the other hand, it may increase the oxygen free radicals and recruit more capillaries to increase pulmonary microvascular permeability. In this connection, we found that endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide reduced pulmonary hypertension but increased the capillary filtration coefficient and the extent of injury in an isolated rat's lung that was subjected to ischemia and reperfusion [16] .",
