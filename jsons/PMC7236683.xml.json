Virus strain was amplified once in Vero E6 cells and had titers of 5 \u00d7 106 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. Huh7 cells (human liver cell line) were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were infected with SARS-COV-2 or PBS (Mock) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 h (Natekar et al., 2019; Azouz et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2018; Krause et al., 2019). Cell were washed twice with PBS and media containing different concentrations of auranofin (0.1\u201310 \u03bcM, Sigma) or DMSO (0.1%, Sigma) was added to cells. Supernatants and cell lysates were harvested at 24 and 48 h after infection. The cytotoxicity of auranofin in Huh7 cells was measured using trypan blue method as described previously (Varghese and Busselberg, 2014). Briefly, Huh7 cells were treated with different concentrations of auranofin (0.1\u201310 \u03bcM) for 48 h and percentage cell numbers were quantified using trypan blue.",
