            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are major causes of upper respiratory tract illness in humans. Recently, a novel HCoV was found to induce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by action of the spike protein of coronavirus to mediate infection of target cells.1 Patients with SARS-associated coronavirus infection could develop atypical pneumonia with fulminant pulmonary edema. Additionally, more than 2000 people have died of this disease during the last two years. Therefore, research and development of an anti-HCoV agent is an important way to control disease. Generally, there are three targets for developing anti-viral agents,2 (1) inhibitors of virus entry and membrane fusion, (2) protease inhibitors to inhibit cleavage of the viral polymerase protein and viral RNA synthesis, and (3) nucleoside inhibitors to block viral replication. Among them, the inhibitors of HCoV (or SARS-CoV) proteinase and anti-HCoV agents are attractive targets for treating SARS now.3 Therefore, L-700,417, a HIV-1 protease, and sabadinine, a natural product isolated from Veratrum sabadilla, were considered as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV proteinase based on computational modeling evaluation.[4], [5] Additionally, glycyrrhizin, a natural component of traditional Chinese medicine from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, was demonstrated to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV.6 On the other hand, HCoVs and their associate viruses usually induced pulmonary inflammation. While the inflammation was induced by virus, a key event (leukocyte extravasation through the endothelium) is the local activation of endothelial cells, as indicated by the expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin.7 Therefore, in our research on anti-HCoV and anti-inflammatory agents from natural sources and their derivatives, we found the dianthranthramide derivatives, benzoxazinones, exhibited anti-HCoV and anti-inflammatory effects.",

In here, we report the preparation and preliminary screen data of anti-HCoV and ICAM-1 expression inhibition of these 2-substituted benzoxazinone analogues (Fig. 2\n).",

Moreover, compounds 1 and 6 were also showed impressive effects in the inhibition of ICAM-1 expression. This is the first report for benzoxazins as ICAM-1 inhibitors, and they also serve as anti-HCoV agents. These results propose a lead compound on research and development of anti-HCoV and ICAM-1 inhibition agents.",
