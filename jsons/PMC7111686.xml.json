Newspapers are under increasing pressure due to declining sales and the growth of free sources of news, such as the Internet and \u2018free sheets\u2019. These findings suggest that medical journalism would be improved if newspapers concentrated on producing a smaller number of more detailed articles, and not be overly reliant on stories derived from press releases from specialist journals, taken out of context, many published as anonymous articles. This is likely to require dedicated health correspondents who are able to build relationships with scientists, gaining the trust of the readership and the scientific community, rather than trying to compete with the ever-increasing amount of \u2018news\u2019 available to the public.",
