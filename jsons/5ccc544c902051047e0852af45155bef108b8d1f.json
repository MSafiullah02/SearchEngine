Though the key platforms for promoting public understanding of science are spearheaded mainly by institutions that promote informal science learning as well as by learned societies, the contribution from newspapers is also important. Content analysis of one continuous week of a national newspaper was undertaken, and the results show that coverage of science and technology was modest and predominantly news driven. For news stories set locally, there was a pronounced emphasis on the use of institutional actors in the text as well as quotations. Articles on health/medicine and earth science elicited the most coverage in the press. Some suggestions for using newspaper science to introduce inquiry in the science classroom are discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Developments in science and technology are impacting society to such an extent that it is increasingly important for the public to keep abreast of these developments to some extent. They would then be in a position to make informed decisions on matters related to science and technology that affect them. For example, high cholesterol foods are increasingly being partaken by people in today's urban societies -are they aware that cholesterol can be deposited on the walls of blood vessels and later give rise to heart problems? Furthermore, with the pervasive influence of globalisation, borders between countries have become more porous, and developments in one country can affect another. Air travel has shrunk distances between countries, and infectious diseases can spread quite rapidly from its source, which could be in another distant part of the world; also, forest fires in one country can affect air quality in neighbouring countries. As such, people do need to know what steps can be taken in order to mitigate such risks. More such examples can be given, but the point to note is that people need to have some basic science literacy in order to manage risks as well as to be able to make prudent decisions on matters related to science and technology that affect them. This is where public education about science can play a useful role.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Science and technology are also recognised as instruments for socio-economic development. Many countries in the West have used this approach to provide their people with a good standard of living. Such an approach for development is possible when people are receptive to the potential of science and technology to promote economic development and their well-being. Again, public education about science is essential. A scientifically literate citizenry can help governments to realise socio-economic objectives (Tan & Subramaniam, 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 536, "text": "(Tan & Subramaniam, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Various mechanisms exist for the dissemination of science and technology to people in Singapore, a country located in South East Asia.

Destinations such as the zoo, bird park and botanic gardens have also played a useful role in public education about science. However, some aspects of public education about science in Singapore have been underexplored (or not done so systematically) in the literature. One of these is the role of print journalism. In reaching out to the public through the print media, there are two key avenues in Singapore -articles in the best-selling local science magazine, the Singapore Scientist, and science-based articles in the national daily, The Straits Times.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 353, "end": 380, "text": "(Caleon & Subramaniam, 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 381, "end": 414, "text": "Dairianathan & Subramaniam, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 415, "end": 438, "text": "Tan & Subramaniam, 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 522, "end": 546, "text": "(Tan & Subramaniam, 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 547, "end": 553, "text": ", 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Public Education About Science in Singapore"}, {"text": "The Singapore Scientist is a popular science magazine published by the Science Centre Singapore. It has been in publication since 1977 and has a readership of about 60,000. Its readers comprise mainly students, but copies of the magazines are also sent to the local institutes of higher learning as well as various government departments and statutory boards. The quarterly magazine is available for sale, mainly through subscriptions for students and direct sales through bookshops. Articles in the magazine come in various forms -for example, articles written by science centre staff and local academics on contemporary topics in science, quizzes, competitions (with prizes) and information about upcoming attractions at the science centre. As the magazine is printed in colour and on glossy paper, it is attractive from a design standpoint. Typically, it is of 50 pages in length. The efforts of popular science magazines also play a useful role in helping to enthuse the school-going public about the multifaceted splendours of science and technology. While somewhat different from other established popular science magazines, such as Popular Science and New Scientist, as the latter two are managed by full-time staff, inclusive of editorial, production and marketing teams, as well as having an international readership, the Singapore Scientist magazine relies almost totally on staff from the science centre to contribute most of the articles and take care of the editorial work and artwork. Profit is not the motive for publishing the magazine, popularising science is. Its circulation is also mainly local. Since the writing in the magazine is generally pitched at the level of school students, often difficult topics can be communicated in a way that they can reasonably understand. More importantly, the fact that a popular science magazine has been in production for over 35 years in Singapore without a full-time editorial and management team and with minimal reliance on advertisements is a testimony to its effectiveness in contributing to public science education in Singapore.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Public Education About Science in Singapore"}, {"text": "The Straits Times, a national newspaper which has a history of over 150 years, regularly carries articles related to science and technology as well as those related to socio-scientific issues, besides others.

The importance given to science can also be seen from the fact that a few reporters cover the local science and technology beat. Given the high circulation of the national newspaper, such articles do reach out to a good number of people in the country and contribute in some way to sensitising them about issues related to science and technology.

These authors also noted that the way an issue is depicted in a press article has a bearing on how the public would interpret it and form their opinions. Sometimes issues are complex to understand, and the reporters have to resort to particular perspectives in order to get the message across to readers. By giving a certain slant to an article, it is possible for a particular message to be conveyed to readers. The notion of 'frame sponsors' (Deprez & Raeymaeckers, 2010) or the participants selected to partake in the process of building the frame is also closely tied to legitimising the views of an article.

Secondly, there has been a marked decline in interest in physics among students at the secondary and postsecondary levels (Oon & Subramaniam, 2010) , leading to a decline in undergraduate enrolment in physics at the local universities (Oon & Subramaniam, 2011) . The lack of reporting of issues related to physics could well be a manifestation of this trend, that is, it is being perceived as being minimally newsworthy. Thirdly, and which is the most plausible reason in my opinion, is that physics has become very much embedded in many other disciplines, including technology, that its purveying per se is not really necessary to reinforce its importance. There is no technology in the medical, biological, chemical, computing and engineering fields that does not make use of some fundamental concepts grounded in physics. That is, there is an implicit, though not explicitly stated, manifestation of the influence of physics in the sciences.

With the mountains of garbage in most countries being either directly incinerated or dumped into landfills, the article on 20 April that a Singapore company is building a waste-to-energy plant in Britain is a reinforcement of the point that Singapore is one of the very few countries that have adopted environmentally friendly practices in waste disposal and that the experience in this initiative has led the company to land a contract to replicate the Singapore experience in the UK. Waste-to-energy plants are a new development in the waste industry -their principal advantage is that the enormous amounts of heat generated during incineration is captured and fed to the country's electricity grid rather than being allowed to go to waste, as is the practice in many countries (Tan & Subramaniam, 2012) . The 20 April article on 'Indonesia fires bring haze to Singapore' is a timely reminder to Singaporeans of the environmental consequences that the action of one country can have on another and of the need to stay tuned to the three-hourly broadcasts of the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) readings. Even most of the articles from overseas also took on a news angle for their reporting. The article on 'Taiwan confirms first case of H7N9 outside mainland China', published on 25 April, is a poignant reminder (without explicitly stating it) to citizens to exercise caution and discretion when travelling to affected countries and reinforces the point that in this age of international travel, people and local health authorities need to stay vigilant.

It may be pertinent to recall the work of Hijmans, Pleijter and Wester (2003) , who have noted that the use of news items allows for relevant scientific knowledge to be slanted into a story for public consumption.

The positioning of an article in this manner may admit of a reportorial acknowledgement that greater authenticity could be endowed on the content if institutional actors are given some, albeit brief, column space. Thus, for example, in the article on 'Residents more worried about dengue', which appeared on 20 April, the Healthway Medical Group and the National Environment Agency earned mentions. It may not be prudent to feature such an article depicting people's concerns if major players in the big picture are left out and their views not sought. In another article on 'Boy burnt by liquid on seat of bus stop', which appeared on the same day, the name of the boy's school as well as the National University Hospital was mentioned. In the article on 'More sightings of wild otters in Singapore', which appeared on 22 April, there were mentions of the National University of Singapore, International Union for Conservation of Nature, the National Parks Board and the name of a wildlife consultant.

It would seem that adherence to such 'norms' -that is, mention of institution and use of quotations -is generally a characteristic feature of science articles generated in the local context. It may be of interest to note that Dimopoulos and Koulaidis (2003) have found that the linkages of science and technology to the corresponding 'social actors' are a characteristic feature of science portrayal in the Greek press. In their study, however, the principal actors were mainly those related to the economy and politics, while in the present study, these were mainly national institutions.

When the visibility of the articles was analysed on the basis of Prominence Index, four were in the earth sciences category and two were in the health/medicine category. Surprisingly, the two articles that generated the most column space in this study did not generate the two highest Prominence Indices. In the literature, the column space area seems to be the de facto measure for endowing articles with visibility. The use of Prominence Index, which is of relatively recent origins, has been the subject of only very few studies. The results of the current study attest to the fact that more research is needed to explore the impact of an article through the use of Prominence Index. Use of multiple measures can help to address the weaknesses inherent in any one measure and help to portray a more realistic picture of the perceived impact of an article in the press. Science journalism via newspapers has probably a greater reach as compared to institutions such as by science centres, mainly as a result of the print medium being able to reach out daily to their large readership base, which runs into the hundreds of thousands for newspapers. Especially, newspapers are ideally positioned to communicate new developments in science and technology on a timescale that is not possible by science centres -for example, it requires time, resources and funding for science centres to mount exhibitions and other programmes on these developments, and some of these developments many not even be amenable to treatment via exhibitry, the principal tool used by science centres to communicate to the public. Since newspapers are published every day, they are in a position to educate the public about new developments in a time-effective manner. However, it has to be noted that given the breadth and scope of scientific disciplines as well as the rate at which new developments in science and technology are occurring, newspapers can cover only a minuscule fraction of what is happening. The fraction that is covered must pass several tests before it can muster editorial acceptance. For example, is the item newsworthy? Is it likely to appeal to a good number of readers? Are there other pressing news items competing for column space at the same time? Is the level of language used in the item amenable to comprehension by the lay public? Is advertising space, which brings in revenue, affected in the process? and so on. Thus, it is not surprising that only a limited number of topics can be covered in newspapers. The lack of a daily science section in The Straits Times is one reason why the scope of coverage of topics is still limited as compared to other newspapers such as The New York Times (Clark & Illman, 2006) and USA Today. The Straits Times, however, has a section devoted specifically to science and which appears on Sundays; both locally generated articles and those from wire services are featured in this section.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3004, "end": 3026, "text": "(Clark & Illman, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The way science is presented in school and the way it is portrayed in the press admits of a dichotomy that is not easy to bridge. Science in schools follows a curricular framework, while that in the media is more complex and very much issues driven. Because of the latter, students, depending on their educational level, may sometimes lack the necessary scientific vocabulary or critical thinking to make sense of the content presented in some of the articles though they may be able to follow these to some extent. This is a challenge for science teachers to address as after all, one of the aims of science education is to make students become more discerning in their approach when reading news in the media, a skill that would be especially needed as they transition to adulthood. McClune and Jarman (2010) call this 'critical engagement with science in the media'. The invoking of relevant articles in the press when teaching particular science topics in the class and coming up with appropriate activities that can provide meaningful learning experiences to students would be a possible approach. These activities can leverage on inquiry in the broad sense. It has to be reiterated that in the literature, there is no consensus on what exactly constitutes inquiry (e.g., Barrow, 2006) . True inquiry is generally regarded as being promoted when students engage in tasks that mirror the work of scientists -for example, doing investigations in the laboratory. However, given the need to complete the curriculum in time and to allocate time for revision activities, there is a limit to how much time teachers can devote to inquiry activities for students in the true context of the word. The laboratory need not necessarily be the place, although it is highly desirable, to promote inquiry. In fact, Chiappetta (1997) notes that 'Scientific inquiry goes beyond constructing knowledge through handson activities. Much of the inquiry that scientists and engineers engage in involves reading and communicating with other people' (p. 25).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1277, "end": 1290, "text": "Barrow, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1821, "text": "Chiappetta (1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications for Teaching"}, {"text": "The classroom can thus be used to promote elements of inquiry to students -for example, use of questioning and crafting of activities that promote thinking without recourse to the laboratory environment. Questioning and thinking are two attributes that are used by scientists in their work, and these can be made the basis for promoting inquiry when using newspaper articles in the teaching of science. Some examples will now be given using the articles covered in The Straits Times. In using the article on 'LNG terminal will boost energy security', published on 26 April, for the teaching of chemistry, students can be given some tasks to do -for example, writing the chemical equation for the combustion of liquefied natural gas and comparing it with when petroleum products are combusted, and asking them to explain from the products formed why the former reaction is in line with clean energy initiatives; calculating the heat change for these reactions to see which reaction produces more energy; following the carbon trail for these fuels to study the effects of pollution; and doing simple cost-benefit analyses in respect of the fuels. Another article which appeared on the same day is 'Banned chemicals found in 3 cosmetic products'. In using this article for the teaching of chemistry, students can be asked to look into the properties of mercury, hydroquinone, salicylic acid and tretinoin from the point of view of its effect on human physiological systems and find out what is the critical concentration beyond which each of these chemicals can pose a risk to human health; by correlating these concentrations with those found in the cosmetic products, they can see why the authorities have banned these products. In line with the recommendations of McClune (2007, 2010) , further activities can be promoted when using press articles for the teaching of science in class -for example, engaging students in a brief question-and-answer session based on the article, promoting general discussion of the article and asking students questions such as what aspects that would allow them to make greater sense of the text are missing from the article; if given an opportunity, what would they want to ask the reporter who wrote the article; and what topics in the syllabus have allowed them to reasonably understand the article.

Students need to realise that the natural world is interdisciplinary in nature and that these artificial divisions are made for pedagogical convenience and administrative reasons. Science-based articles in newspaper offer tremendous potential to reiterate this point. For example, in the article on 'Indonesia fires bring haze to Singapore' which appeared on 20 April, a number of subject domains will be apparent -the slight changes in the composition of the atmosphere due to the presence of colloidal particles as well as the reduced visibility arising from these can be linked to chemistry; forest clearing via burning to make a way for development can be linked to earth science; deforestation contributing to reduced transpiration and photosynthesis has implications in biology; and the body parts affected as a result of such pollution can be related to biology or medicine. In the article on 'Banned chemicals found in 3 cosmetic products', linkages can be made to not only chemistry but also biology.

Other topics which could be explored are how controversial issues in science are presented, what the tone of coverage in the articles is and how the tensions between multiple perspectives in a topic are managed in the various articles.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "In Singapore, public education about science comes under the mandate of a few agencies dedicated to informing the public on such matters. Contributing to and complementing these efforts are the efforts of other platforms. The role of science journalism via newspapers is such a platform and it has been explored in this study. It is shown that there is modest coverage of science in one major local newspaper, with the coverage being more pronounced for health/medicine and earth sciences for the period explored. As the newspaper medium has not been explored for science coverage in the Singapore context in the literature, this chapter is a small contribution in this respect.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans":
