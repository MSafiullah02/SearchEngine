Standard fixation procedures should be sufficient to kill microorganisms, one exception being material from those with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other prion diseases. It has been shown that well-fixed tissue, paraffin-processed blocks and stained slides from CJD cases remain infectious when introduced into susceptible animals. Treatment of fixed tissue or slides in 96% formic acid for 1 hour followed by copious washing inactivates this infectious agent without adversely affecting section quality (Brown et al., 1990). Laboratory safety protocols should cover infection containment in all laboratory areas and the mortuary, or necropsy area, where handling unfixed material is unavoidable. When available, unfixed tissue samples should be sent for microbiological culture, as this offers the best chance of rapid and specific identification of etiological agents, even when heavy bacterial contamination may have occurred.",

There are many commercially available antibodies for viral, bacterial and parasitic organisms. Most methods today utilize (strept)avidin-biotin technologies. These are based on the high affinity that (strept)avidin (Streptomyces avidinii) and avidin (chicken egg) have for biotin. Both possess four binding sites for biotin, but due to the molecular orientation of the binding sites fewer than four molecules of biotin will actually bind. The basic sequence of reagent application consists of primary antibody, biotinylated secondary antibody, followed by either the preformed (strept)avidin-biotin enzyme complex or the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique or by the enzyme-labeled streptavidin. Both conclude with the substrate solution. Horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatases are the most commonly used enzyme labels.",

These methods represent a rapidly expanding and exciting field, particularly when considering novel and emerging infections. However, testing must be undertaken rationally and appropriately in order to produce meaningful results (Procop, 2007). Conventional staining may lack sensitivity and specificity to detect and speciate microorganisms. Microbial culture is not viable from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. In comparison, molecular identification of pathogens is rapid with high sensitivity and specificity and can be applied to a variety of histological specimens (Rogers et al., 2009).",

In addition, as technology advances, it is now possible to obtain detailed genetic sequencing information which provides important information relating to microbial transmission, virulence and resistance mechanisms. This is increasingly important in an age of global communities and the advent of unprecedented antimicrobial resistance. However, further studies are still required to answer a more fundamental question, which is whether molecular testing improves patient outcomes, and this is an area for future work.

The fatty capsule influences the penetration and resistance to removal of the stain by acid and alcohol (acid- and alcohol-fastness), and is variably robust between the various species which make up this group. Phenolic acid, and frequently heat, are used to reduce surface tension and increase porosity, thus forcing dyes to penetrate this capsule. The speed with which the primary dye is removed by differentiation with acid alcohol is proportional to the extent of the fatty coat. The avoidance of defatting agents or solvents, such as alcohol and xylene in methods for Mycobacterium leprae, is an attempt to conserve this fragile fatty capsule.",

The tissue reaction to leprosy depends on the immune status of the host. It can be minimal with a few macrophages packed with crescentic, pointed, intracytoplasmic bacilli (lepromatous leprosy), or may contain scanty organisms and show florid granulomatous response (tuberculoid leprosy). M. leprae is only acid-fast and is best demonstrated with the modifed Fite method (see page 261).",
