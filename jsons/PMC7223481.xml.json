In addition, grade IVa is defined as single organ dysfunction requiring dialysis, or mechanical ventilation, and grade IVb refers to multiple organ failure. Grade V is defined as the complication-related death of patients. In previous reports, the rates of grade IV and V complications were 0.6\u20131.1% and 0.1\u20130.5%, respectively [6, 11]. In most other studies addressing postoperative complications after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, grade IV complication rates have not been specifically mentioned [3\u20135]. Reasons for lack of data might cause difficulty in clearly defining the CDC grade IV complications, complexity of ICU treatments, and vast number of other parameters that influence the appropriate classification.",

Patients who underwent palliative procedures without gastrectomy (e.g., gastro-jejunostomy and explorative laparotomy) or procedures in cooperation with other surgical techniques (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft and abdominal aorta aneurysm operation) were excluded.

Complications data based on CDC were collected prospectively through weekly team meetings [10]. The type of complications was divided into two categories: local and systemic. Complications were defined and grouped based on our previous report on complication following gastrectomy [11].

We adopted this concept when determining the cause of organ failure and mortality. Based on this classification and clinical relevance and frequency of occurrence, we allocated the cases based on the causes of organ failure and mortality into six categories with slight modifications: pulmonary failure (pneumonia, prolonged ventilator assistance, pulmonary edema, pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumothorax); surgical site complications (hemorrhage and surgical site infection); cardiac complication (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and unexplained cardiac arrest); cerebrovascular complications (stroke); cancer progression; and other complications (urinary tract infection and suicide). Three attending surgeons (HJ Lee, JH Park, and SY Oh) independently reviewed all medical records including ICU data and determined the cause of organ failure and death. In case of disagreement, the medical record was reviewed by the entire committee. After discussion, a final consensus on the cause of organ failure and death was reached.",

In the acute care surgical field, characteristics of complications such as type of seminal complication and number of complications were reported as significant prognostic factors for FTR [32, 33]. However, details about complication (type of 1st complication, duration, timing of complication) did not influence FTR in our study.",

Many prognostic models exist, suggesting that the optimum model has not been established. In particular, few studies have applied risk scoring systems to ICU patients with gastric cancer. The most commonly used adult ICU prognostic scoring systems are APACHE and SAPS. Major revisions of these models were published between 2005 and 2006, namely APACHE IV in 2006 and SAPS 3 in 2005 [18, 20]. Moreover, the SOFA score is used to track a patient\u2019s status during the stay in an ICU to determine the organ function or rate of failure. In this study, we analyzed these three systems and SAPS 3 was most useful in predicting FTR among gastric cancer patients with organ failure. Unlike other systems, SAPS 3 includes data regarding the anatomical site of surgery, presence of acute infection at ICU admission, and vasoactive drug therapy before ICU admission (Table 1). These factors might contribute to the accuracy of the analysis of gastric cancer patients. Future studies are needed to evaluate the role of risk scoring or benchmarking, performance improvement, resource use, and clinical decision support.",

More than half of the risk for mortality is already determined when a patient is admitted to the ICU. In order to reduce mortality, it is advisable to correct physiologic indices when a high risk of mortality is suspected as soon as possible and perform prompt assessments to identify patient status. In this system, mortality differs in the etiology for ICU admission; transient organ failure shows a better chance of recovery compared to definite conditions such as intracranial mass or severe pancreatitis.",
