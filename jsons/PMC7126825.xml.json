            "text": "The study of feline genetics had its roots in early gene-mapping strategies using linkage and physical mapping approaches 19, 20, 21, 22. Over the past few decades, several important biological and informatics resources required for genetic investigations in cats were developed. The resources are comparable to those developed in other genome projects and include the following: (i) somatic cell and radiation hybrid panels used to build a framework physical map of comparative anchor tagged sequence (CATS) markers for cats 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28; (ii) three large cat pedigrees used to build a cat linkage map 29, 30, 31, 32; (iii) several genomic libraries (BAC, PAC, cosmid and fosmid) for gene discovery and genome assembly validation 33, 34, 35 and (iv) finished DNA sequence of three subregions of the cat genome [i.e. FLA, the major histocompatibility complex (3.3 Mbp), mitochondrial DNA and counterpart nuclear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; numt) sequence; and 30 Mbp of the ENCODE Project cat genome sequence (http://www.genome.gov/10005107, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40). The application of these important tools led to significant advances in cat genetics including gene discovery and regional gene annotation and to anticipation for a whole genome sequence.",

            "text": "In 2005, the cat was included in a selection of 24 mammals for whole genome sequencing by National Human Genome Research Institute, to facilitate interpretation of the finished human genome sequence. The species were chosen to capture the evolutionary divergence across the 4500 living species of mammals initially with a \u2018light\u2019 (i.e. twofold) genome coverage 18, 41. The principal criteria for selecting these species were (i) to discover short conserved sequence regions among mammals that would include gene regulatory motifs; (ii) to provide a platform for reconstruction of ancestral genomes that preceded the divergence nodes of the mammalian radiations and (iii) to stimulate the development and application of new animal models for human medicine and biology. In 2006, the whole genome sequence of a female Abyssinian cat named Cinnamon was determined by Agencourt Bioscience (http://www.agencourt.com); Abyssinian cats are the most inbred, making genome assembly easier. A consortium of scientists assembled, mapped and annotated the cat genome sequence using a comparative approach that involved cross-reference to NCBI-annotated genome assembles of six index mammals (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog and cow) [8]. For details of the annotation strategy and highlights of genomic features that were discovered, see Box 1\n.Box 1Annotation of the cat whole genome sequenceHere we give an overview of the strategy and main conclusions from the cat genome sequence study; full details can be found in Ref. [8]. The \u2018light\u2019 (1.9-fold coverage) of Cinnamon was assembled, mapped and annotated using a comparative approach to finished whole genomes sequence/maps of six mammals (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog and cow). Briefly, 8 027 672 sequence reads (84% plasmid and 16% fosmid) were assembled to 817 956 overlapping contigs and 217 790 scaffolds using the ARACHNE and PHUSION genome assembly algorithms 93, 94, 95. The contigs were aligned to the index mammals\u2019 sequence maps and anchored with 1682 ordered markers from the cat radiation\u2013hybrid map, assuming that the order of reciprocal best match (RBM) sequences between the radiation hybrid (RH) anchor markers for cats was the same as for a their dog and human counterparts. The cat genome sequence is accessible on a web-based genome sequence browser, GARFIELD http://lgd.abcc.ncifcrf.gov\n8, 96, which includes the following annotated features:o817 956 contigs and 217 790 scaffolds across 2.7 Gbp of cat genome sequenceodefinition and mapping of >1 million RBM alignments between cat and six index mammals, revealing a set of 133 499 conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) present in all seven genomes.

Cinnamon's genomic history was molded by three episodes of historic inbreeding; the original domestication event for cats (\u223c10 000 years ago), Abyssinian breed formation and disease (rdAc) pedigree establishment 42, 43. Her genome is a patchwork of short regions of SNP homozygosity interspersed with regions of heterozygosity (more than one SNP per 600 bp), perhaps a reflection of historic inbreeding. In total, there are 275 alternating homozygous/heterozygous segments in Cinnamon's genome, with 57% of her genome being largely homozygous. Similar alternating homozygous genome segments occur in dogs, likely for the same reason [44].",

Currently there are 38 cat genes for which mutational variants responsible for feline metabolic diseases or for morphological phenotypes are described [8]. This includes 18 hereditary diseases, where the mutation in cat occurs in the homologous gene to the analogous human syndrome. The single exception, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a leading cause of human infant mortality, involved a large 140-kb deletion of the LIX1 gene in the cat model [45]. The LIX1 gene is located on chromosome A1 within 25 cm (Mbp) of the SMN1 gene, whose human homolog carries causal mutations in 97% of human SMA patients. In addition, the resolution of the molecular genetic bases of ten coat color (or hair length) variants now establishes cats as important species for study of pigmentation, hair development and ocular albinism 8, 21, 31, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.",

The planned supplement of SNP discovery using \u2018light\u2019 resequence coverage of 30 cats from ten cat breeds assures a large store of SNPs and short tandem repeats (STRs) suitable for gene association discovery using SNP genotyping arrays. The decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) already measured among 24 cat breeds predicts that a SNP genotypic array including \u223c45 000 evenly placed SNPs is appropriate for gene association discovery in cats, similar to the approach successfully applied to dogs 8, 44, 52, 53. However, cats have shorter LD stretches than dogs (because they were domesticated more recently than dogs; see below) and require three times more SNPs for gene association studies. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to the discovery of 2 million new SNPs, which will aid the development of an eagerly awaited genotype array chip of 80 000\u2013100 000 SNPs, suitable for genome-wide association studies. The dog genome sequence led to scores of new gene discoveries 44, 52, 53; the availability of these promising cat genome resources portends that cat advances should be close behind.",

Using sophisticated breakpoint parsimony algorithms [genome rearrangements in man and mouse (GRIMM) synteny and multiple genome rearrangement algorithm (MGR)] 62, 63, 64 that resolved the breakpoint coordinates joining 500 homologues synteny blocks [HSBs; previously called smallest combined evolutionary unit segments (SCEUS); Figure 1\n], the paradigm of dichotomous rates of genome exchange was unseated 8, 26. The wrinkle came from the occurrence of numerous intrachromosomal rearrangements but at different tempos in the slow default translocation lineages versus the reshuffled lineages (Figure 1). A preliminary analysis of six species genome sequences showed that lineages with few translocation exchanges display considerably more intrachromosomal inversions, whereas species with reshuffled and increased translocations showed fewer inversions (Table 2\n). The total number of translocations plus inversions is similar in all lineages, because in the slow \u2018default\u2019 lineages (human and cat), inversions are increased, whereas in the shuffled translocation-rich lineages (murids and dogs), inversions are infrequent.

Second, \u223c20% of chromosome breakpoint regions defined by comparative alignments were not only reused more than once during mammalian evolution, but the reused sites are clustered nonrandomly around centromeres. Third, chromosomal breakpoints defined between mammals show a marked enrichment in gene density compared with the genome-wide average; they seem to cluster in gene-rich areas. Fourth, primate-defined breakpoints (translocation and inversion) occur in regions of human segmental duplications, suggesting that such local aneuploidy plays a part in chromosomal exchange. Finally, evolutionary breakpoints in mammal lineages seem to coincide with breakpoints that occur in human cancers, suggestive of a common underlying mechanism.",

This was accomplished by selecting 35 cat genes (a total of 22 789 bp chosen from autosomal, mitochondrial, X- and Y-linked loci) that were sequenced in all cat species [1]. Available tree-building algorithms converged on a phylogenetic tree on which the nodes could be dated with a dozen well-calibrated fossils. The earliest predecessor of living cats, Pseudaelurus, lived in Eurasia during the Miocene and spawned the Asian ancestor of modern cats \u223c11 MYA. Molecular phylogeny defined eight principal Felidae lineages (Figure 3), descended from major Miocene divergence events that form the axiom for Felidae genus recognition [69]. Armed with robust and high resolution molecular phylogeny, the fossil-calibrated dates for the branches, the current and historic locations of cat species and a record of global sea level changes and continental movements, we postulated a plausible sequence of 11 historic felid migrations to explain available data 1, 2. This scenario describes our current understanding of how cats came to be (Figure 3).",

Interestingly, a novel species of clouded leopards, Neofelis diardi, the first new Felidae species described in a century, was defined recently on the basis of genomic analysis 70, 71. A second major separation, also in Asia, led to the Bornean bay cat lineage, a group that evolved, speciated and currently resides in Southeast Asia. The next divergence and first intercontinental migration founded the caracal lineage, three African cat species whose progenitors crossed into Africa 6\u201310 MYA (migration route A; Figure 3). During the Miocene, sea levels were \u223c60 m below current levels such that Africa and the Arabian Peninsula were connected by land bridges across the Red Sea, facilitating the first felid migration to Africa. During the same period, cats dispersed across Asia and traversed the Bering Straits to Alaska (migration route B; Figure 3). The earliest progenitors of three subsequent cat lineages, (the ocelot, lynx and puma) were found in North America. Thus, cats were present in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. Subsequently the sea levels rose, separating the continents; the changing habitats of the now \u2018isloated\u2019 cats contributed to the evolution of new cat species we are familiar with today.",

Although it was well known that modern wildcat populations often include ongoing admixture of domestic cats and wildcats 42, 78, 79, 80, 81, subspecies-specific nuclear and mtDNA lineages in each population were clearly resolved. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, two versions of mtDNA genotypes were apparent (domestic and African wildcat; beige and blue pie charts, respectively, in Figure 4). The derivative molecular phylogeny for five geographically distinct subspecies (F.s. silvestris, F. cafra, F.s. ornata, F.s.lybica and F.s. bieti) were monophyletic and well resolved using both mtDNA sequence (Figure 5a) and composite STR genotypes [42]. The analysis also showed that a large assemblage of domestic cats from across the globe (including 112 fancy breed cats) had genotypes that were indistinguishable from the clades defined by the Near East subspecies F.s. lybica. Furthermore, a STRUCTURE-based population genetic analysis identified a discrete population of wildcats from the Near East (Israel, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; Figure 5b) that probably reflects the ancestral founder population for the world's domestic cats.",

Alternatively, the combined genomic archaeological data seem to point to a domestication event in the Near East around the same time as the first agricultural village settlements in the Fertile Crescent (\u223c10 000 years ago).Perhaps the wild cats made themselves useful to early farmers by dispatching rodents from the early grain stores.",

A comprehensive SNP and STR survey of 38 cat breeds (\u223c27 individuals per breed, 1040 cats in total) revealed only modest phylogenetic and population genetic partitions caused by the recent timing of breed initiation and (unlike dog breeds) the allowable intercrossing between certain breeds in recent generations 89, 90. Nonetheless, there is a recognizable and diagnostic population structure that permitted confirmation of 96% breed assignment on the basis of a forensic panel of ten highly informative, tetra-nucleotide STR loci [91]. In Figure 6\n, we present a phylogenetic topology of 34 cat breeds based on composite STR genotype, population genetic\u2013based STRUCTURE algorithm output of the same individuals.
