Tourism demand is particularly sensitive to security and health concerns (Blake & Thea Sinclair, 2003), and the industry is highly susceptible to changes in the international political situation, natural disasters, and epidemics (Cavlek, 2002, Ioannides and Apostolopoulos, 1999, Richter, 2003, Sonmez, 1998, Sonmez et al., 1999). In recent years major disruptions that have affected international tourism flows include the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the US, the Foot and Mouth outbreak in UK farms in 2001, the October 12, 2002 terrorist attack on Indonesia's resort island of Bali, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the 2004 tsunami in South Asia. These events caused severe declines in tourist arrivals in those places and had a crucial impact on regional tourism (Blake and Thea Sinclair, 2003, Blake et al., 2003, Huang and Min, 2002, Prideaux et al., 2003). Tourists concern about health risks is increasing. Infectious disease particularly poses a direct impact on travel behavior and on the choice of tourist destination (Cartwright, 2000).",

Explaining the process of crisis/disaster and the recovery is rarely addressed. On the other hand, traditional methods such as regression can be used to perform data analysis to indicate what has happened, but cannot explain why. The use of the catastrophe model can help achieve this.",

            "text": "Catastrophe theory was developed in the early 1970s to provide a theoretical framework for studying discontinuous phenomena in otherwise continuous systems (Thom, 1975, Woodcock and Davis, 1978, Zeeman, 1976, Zeeman, 1977). Catastrophe phenomena are \u201ca class of dynamic processes that exhibit a sudden and large scale change in at least one variable in correspondence with relatively small changes in other variables\u201d (Brown, 1995, p. 1) (e.g., water suddenly boils, ice melts, earthquake, and stock market crash). In some ways the original designation of the dynamics as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d is unfortunate because this term is colloquially used to describe extreme and negative changes (Lockwood & Lockwood, 1993). In the mathematical usage, the term \u201ccatastrophe\u201d means a process that is manifested as sudden changes in the state of the system (e.g., the shift of an animal's behavior from attack to submission, Saunders, 1980). The theory was popularized in the early 1970s, and has been applied to human and social science (e.g., Bigelow, 1982, Guastello, 1982, Herbig, 1991, Kauffman and Oliva, 1994, Poston and Stewart, 1996, Saunders, 1980, Sheridan and Abelson, 1983, Zeeman, 1976, Zeeman, 1977). Some controversy in the application of the theory has been discussed (e.g., Kolata, 1977, Sussman and Zahler, 1978a, Sussman and Zahler, 1978b, Zahler and Sussman, 1977). The main controversy includes excessive reliance on qualitative methods, inappropriate quantization in some applications, and the use of excessively restrictive or narrow mathematical assumptions. However, one advantage of the theory is that the most important idea associated with it can be learned without getting into the detailed mechanics of catastrophe theory itself.",

However, Japanese tourists tend to have a high preference for safe and passive activities (Pizam and Jeong, 1996, Pizam et al., 1997). As a result, the willingness of Japanese tourists to visit Taiwan fell sharply due to the adverse impact of SARS outbreak. It is known that the traveling purposes that do qualify as tourism include recreation, visiting friends and relatives, and business (Weaver & Oppermann, 2000, p. 29). However, only the purpose of recreation is considered in this study. According to the statistics of the TTB, before the outbreak of the SARS, the number of Japanese tourist arrivals (only for the purpose of recreation) in Taiwan averaged around 50,000 per month. During the SARS period, the number of Japanese arrivals declined sharply from 60,786 in March 2003 to 1227 in June, the steepest drop ever recorded in history. After Taiwan was officially removed from the list of SARS-affected areas on July 2003, there was a slight rebound in the number of fully independent travelers from Japan. The number of Japanese tour groups, however, remained very low. The TTB immediately launched aggressive promotion campaigns in the Japanese market to jack up the tourism demand. The number of inbound tourists altogether from Japan started bouncing up slowly and but steadily since August 2003, it was until September 2004 the Japanese travelers regained the pre-SARS level of 50,000-plus arrivals per month (see Fig. 1\n).",

This phenomenon where the critical point of the recovery process does not coincide with that of the original state change process, but locates at a farther away position (or equivalently with a time lag comparing to the \u201csupposedly to occur\u201d time point) is called the hysteresis effect of a catastrophe system (The forth and back tracks of the state change processes shown on the state surface should be aligned together, but are drawn as separated lines for the convenience of illustration.). The hysteresis phenomenon represents the effect of system memory or the inertia of the system. Thus for a changed system to recover its original state, it must be \u201cover-corrected\u201d with extra efforts. The existence of hysteresis effect also calls for the need to exercise a deliberate \u201cunfreezing\u201d (to break the ice of system inertia) endeavor before any drastic change of the state of a system can bring about.",

A comparative graph is given in Fig. 4\nto reflect the test results. To the Hong Kong and US travelers, the statistical analysis results indicate that both arrival patterns can be divided into three stages, namely, stage 1: before the outbreak of SARS, stage 2: the SARS epidemic period, and stage 3: the SARS alert lifted. Each of their arrival levels in stage 1 was statistically indifferent from that in stage 3, respectively, while the levels in stage 2 was significantly different from the respective levels in the other two stages. This verifies the existence of binary patterns (bimodality) from pre to post-SARS period. In addition, the arrivals from both countries exhibited significant abrupt drops as soon as the outbreak of SARS and bouncing back up to the pre-SARS level clearly right after the alert was released. This verifies the existence of threshold effect. However, because in both cases, the arrivals revived immediately after the removal of SARS alert, they demonstrated no hysteresis effect.",

As a result, they had no hesitation to make the \u201ccome\u201d decision immediately after the SARS alert was removed. On the other hand, while the US was not a SARS-affected country (like Japan), its recovery pattern without hysteresis was similar to that of Hong Kong. One possible reason is that the US travelers are more confident of the judgment of WHO. Once WHO had removed Taiwan from the list of the SARS-affected areas, they departed for Taiwan without hesitation.",

Since individual Japanese tourists have different perception of security towards travel risk in the post-SARS period (i.e., the splitting factor b is heterogeneous), the time each traveler taken to make his or her decision to \u201ccome\u201d varied significantly. If their perceived risk was homogeneous, then, in this extreme case, the hysteresis effect would result in a delay which took a shape as an extended horizontal line to the far right and bounced vertically up to the pre-SARS level as line (1) shown in Fig. 5\n. As to line (2), it demonstrates that if the market can be hypothetically grouped into two segments with different levels of perceived risk, then the recovery pattern will be in a single step form. However, the actual perceived risk may be distributed as a wide range and the corresponding recovery pattern collectively can be approximated by a multiple-step form as line (3) shown in the same figure.",

According to the cusp catastrophe model, it is rather clear that after the outbreak of any natural or human disaster, the first thing to do in the destination country is to control the situation and restore it into order as soon as possible. In the cusp catastrophe term, it means that the responsible authorities or agencies of the destination country should commit themselves into a battle of annihilation against the normal factor in an effective and efficient way so as to bring it back to the regular mode, e.g., to remove the SARS alert officially in their country as soon as possible. Without the reversal of the normal factor (e.g., from with SARS to without SARS), there is no ground to promote and attract inbound tourists from other countries. The sooner the normal factor can be changed to the original mode, the earlier the destination is ready to receive the return of the inbound travelers.",

Such an action will produce the following effects: the right threshold line in Fig. 6\nwill be rotated in the clockwise direction and moved as closer to the vertical axis as possible. This reflects the relaxation of the alertness at the group norm level and in turn will induce the travelers to make their \u201ccome\u201d decision much earlier. The macro level to reduce the public fear/risk in the origin country will effectively shorten the stage 3 in Fig. 5.(2)Micro strategy targeted to individuals: to reduce the perceived risk of individual traveler (to move the b\u2019s coordinates further up along the vertical axis, i.e., from b\n0 to b\n1 in Fig. 6) through segmented and individualized marketing channels so as to help make up his/her mind to come earlier.\n",

The studies on the subjects of crisis, disaster and their recovery, in the past, are mainly addressing the economic impacts and the prospects for crisis management. The issue regarding the pre-through-post process of the incident is rarely dealt with mainly because of its complexity. This study has demonstrated that the catastrophe theory is useful to describe the disastrous process and to explain its underlying causal relationships among the key factors. It is plausible to argue that the same approach (including statistical verification) can be applicable to analyze other disasters in the tourism market, for instance, the 2002 terrorist attack in Bali, the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
