In these models, transmission rates are used to describe the flow of individuals in a population going from a susceptible state to an infected state, and it is important to obtain a realistic estimate of the transmission rates in order to create a useful and realistic simulation models for decision support11\u201313. Accurate estimation of this rate is important because it can have a major influence on model predictions and conclusions (e.g. refs11,14). The rate may have different names depending on the specific mathematical representation of transfer between susceptible and disease states, e.g. infection rate, transmission coefficient and transmission rate. This key parameter is difficult to estimate for most host-pathogen models because natural processes are stochastic, and transmission events are influenced by other parameters than what can be included in a transmission model1,15. Thus, large datasets are often needed to reach a good estimate.",

A means to obtain longitudinal data for estimation of the transmission rate can be to sample a subpopulation instead of the whole population, as for instance the study of Backer et al.16 where field data were used to estimate transmission rate of hepatitis E virus in pigs, subsampling down to 5% of the population. This can be the case for instance if animals must be caught prior to sampling, if the population is large, or if the test for disease is expensive17. In such situations subsampling can be a convenient method, but the precision of the estimate can be jeopardized by sampling fewer individuals. We wanted to quantify this in the present study.",

            "text": "In longitudinal studies of disease transmission, a short sampling interval is often desired because it provides precise data on the incidence. Ideally, the period between sampling points should be the average time between the infection of one individual and the infection of the next individual that is infected from the first individual18. However, it is often not practical to sample with very short sampling intervals. For instance, Caley and Ramsey12 used a sampling scheme with three samplings per year, and Zadoks et al.11 sampled every three weeks. If the time between sampling points is long, some individuals may be infected and recovered between sampling points and therefore not recorded. Hence, the transmission rate will be underestimated. On top of that, data from biological systems most often contains noise that may impact the estimated rate. Numerous studies have estimated the transmission rate from field data11,16,19. However, few studies have evaluated how precise the estimated transmission rates actually are. O\u2019Dea et al.20 recently used Poisson regression to estimate the transmission rate and showed that the precision of the estimate increased with the number of outbreaks used for estimation. Cook et al.21 used Bayesian inference to show that it is important to take spatial population heterogeneity into account when estimating transmission rates. To our knowledge, no previous studies have explored the precision of the estimated transmission rate in relation to a known simulated transmission rate, the sampling interval and the subsampling percentage.",

A challenge of estimating transmission rates is that a low rate can result in very low numbers of or no new infections per time period, which can prevent the use of regression procedures with a log-link.

The SIScom model is a complete individual based model of a cow herd, were cows can be culled based on low milk yield or high somatic cell count, and can befall ill and slaughtered, there is also separation between cows in different production stages (lactating, drying off, giving birth). The SIScom model was created by merging the transmission framework for intramammary infection created by Halasa et al.14 with the iCull simulation model described by Kirkeby et al.28. Briefly, the iCull model simulates a dairy herd with 200 cows and after a 3 year burn in period the SIScom model is started. We recorded data during a single simulated year. In the model, all cows are simulated realistically where they typically calve and lactate for around 350 days. Then they are dried off in about 56 days and then they calve again. The farmer takes weekly decisions on culling, choosing the lowest producing cows for slaughter. Individuals can also be culled due to diseases like infection. Individuals are only culled when new heifers, raised in the herd, enter the lactation stage. Thus the number of individuals is kept fairly stable. The transmission framework was adopted from Halasa et al.14, simulating intramammary infections (IMI). Susceptible individuals can be infected with IMI and enter a subclinical or a clinical stage. Infections in subclinical individuals can flare up, and the infection in clinical individuals can be subclinical again (remission). Finally, infected individuals can recover from disease and be susceptible again. The disease spread is analogue to the differential equations:4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\,\\beta \\frac{{I}_{S}+{I}_{C}}{N}S+{\\alpha }_{S}{I}_{S}+\\eta \\,{\\alpha }_{C}{I}_{C}-\\mu S+\\mu N$$\\end{document}dSdt=\u2212\u03b2IS+ICNS+\u03b1SIS+\u03b7\u03b1CIC\u2212\u03bcS+\u03bcN5\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{d{I}_{S}}{dt}=\\rho \\beta \\frac{{I}_{S}+{I}_{C}}{N}S-{\\alpha }_{S}{I}_{S}+\\mathrm{(1}-\\eta )\\,{\\alpha }_{C}{I}_{C}-{\\gamma }_{S}{I}_{S}-\\mu {I}_{S}$$\\end{document}dISdt=\u03c1\u03b2IS+ICNS\u2212\u03b1SIS+(1\u2212\u03b7)\u03b1CIC\u2212\u03b3SIS\u2212\u03bcIS6\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{d{I}_{C}}{dt}=\\mathrm{(1}-\\rho )\\beta \\frac{{I}_{S}+{I}_{C}}{N}S-{\\alpha }_{C}{I}_{C}+{\\gamma }_{S}{I}_{S}-\\mu {I}_{C}$$\\end{document}dICdt=(1\u2212\u03c1)\u03b2IS+ICNS\u2212\u03b1CIC+\u03b3SIS\u2212\u03bcICwhere S is the number of susceptible individuals, IS is the number of subclinically infected individuals, IC is the number of clinically infected individuals, and any other parameters are given in Table 1 in the supplementary material.

The estimation error increased with large sampling intervals and high transmission rates.

The two new methods assume that the system is close to an endemic equilibrium, while the Poisson method assumes that the number of susceptible and infected animals is stable between sampling points.

The infectivity could also be heterogeneously distributed within the population, adding to the complexity in real populations21.

This means that Method 2 is not as sensitive to large sampling intervals as the two other methods.
