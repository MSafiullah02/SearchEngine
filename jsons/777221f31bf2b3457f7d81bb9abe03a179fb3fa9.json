The presence of neutralizing antibodies is a strong correlate of protection against lethal disease in animals. However, since RNA viruses are prone to high mutation rates, the possibility that these viruses will escape neutralization remains a potential concern. In the present study, we generated neutralization-escape mutants, using 6 different monoclonal antibodies, and studied the effect of these neutralization-escape mutations on in vitro and in vivo fitness. These data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of cocktails of cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize residues within the glycoprotein that are important for virus replication and virulence.",

            "text": "Henipaviruses (HNVs) are emerging zoonotic viruses that belong to the family Paramyxoviridae [1] . The genus Henipavirus is currently composed of 3 viruses, Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah virus (NiV), and Cedar virus [2] . Outbreaks of HeV and NiV infection occur almost yearly in horses and/or humans, and the human case-fatality rates range from 57%-100% [1] . Currently, no vaccines or therapeutics are approved for use in humans. Neutralizing antibodies are a strong correlate of protection in experimental animal challenge models [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . A well-characterized human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (m102.4) has been used on a compassionate-use basis in 9 individuals who were at high risk of exposure to HeV in Australia and in 1 individual at high risk of exposure to NiV in the United States [8] . Several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that target the HNV glycoprotein (G) [8] [9] [10] . G is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal ectodomain, which is divided into the stalk region and the globular head domain. The globular head domain is involved in receptor binding, while the stalk region is involved in triggering the fusion protein (F) to induce virus-cell fusion [11] . The 2 main mechanisms of neutralization involve blocking the interaction of the HNV G with its receptors ephrin B2 and B3, to block virus attachment or blocking the induction of fusion. Recently, the crystal structure of HeV G bound to a derivative of the human mAb m102.4 was solved [12] , showing that the interaction of m102.4 involves binding of 4 hydrophobic pockets that also engage the HNV receptors, suggesting direct competition for the receptor-binding site [12] .",

In vitro growth characteristics of wild-type Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) and neutralization-escape mutants. Cultures of Vero E6 were infected in triplicate with wild-type and neutralization-escape mutants of HeV (A) and NiV strain Malaysia (NiV-M; B) at a multiplicity of 0.01, as described in \"Materials and Methods\" section. Virus titers at different time points were determined by a 50% tissue infective culture dose (TCID 50 ) assay, using Vero E6 cells. Error bars represent standard deviations. *P < .05 by 2-way analysis of variance, compared with the wild-type strain. ( Figure 7A ). Mutations in the NiV-M G at residues Q388R, V507I, and Q450K resulted in replication below the levels of detection in lungs and brains of moribund hamsters ( Figure 7B ). The mutation at R516K resulted in levels of replication in lungs and brains similar to those for WT NiV-M ( Figure 7B) . DISCUSSION We performed a detailed analysis of the residues critical for HNV neutralization by 6 different mAbs. We focused on the G, since this is a major surface membrane glycoprotein that is required for virus attachment and fusion. As previously reported, mAb m102.4 effectively neutralizes HeV and NiV-M, as well as the NiV-B strain [12] . Surprisingly, while the mAb 213 efficiently neutralized the NiV-M strain, the NiV-B strain was not completely neutralized. There are 25 amino acid changes between the G of NiV-M and NiV-B; however, a mutation at residue Q388, which was associated with escape from neutralization by mAb 213, is not one of them. Interestingly, 2 mutations, at residues T385A and K386E, are present in NiV-B, which could affect the structure of the loop responsible for the interaction of Q388 with D108 on the ephrin B2 molecule [18, 19] . It has previously been shown that mAb 213 recognizes a conformational epitope on the NiV-M G and that binding is affected by a N-glycosylation site in the stalk region [20] .",

This is not surprising, since the mAbs used in this study all targeted the HNV G. Two neutralization-escape mutants had 2 amino acid changes in NiV-M. They shared a mutation at residue N159, but this mutation was unlikely to play a role in neutralization escape, since each escape mutant was only refractory to neutralization by its respective mAb. This suggests that the unique changes at R516K or Q388R and not the common residue at N159D play a role in neutralization escape from mAbs 213 and nAH1.3. The function of the N159D change in association with neutralization escape remains unknown, but it is possible that this is a compensatory change. Position 159 is between 2 critical cysteines, C158 and C162, of the NiV G stalk region that mediate covalent subunit dimerization [21] . Residue 159 is also a predicted glycosylation site (G2) that plays a crucial role in membrane fusion and F triggering [20] .",

The V507I and D582N mutations in NiV-M and HeV respectively have previously been shown to disrupt m102.4 binding while maintaining high affinity for ephrin B2 and B3. The crystal structure of m102.3 (m102.4 derivative) bound to the HeV G shows that m102.3 resembles the G-H loop of ephrin B2 in both its shape and insertion angle into the HeV G binding pocket [12] . The HeV escape mutant H406Y is adjacent to another binding pocket on the HeV G that is responsible for interacting with the ephrin B2 residue W122 [17] . Finally, the Q388R mutation affects the hydrogen bond between Q388 and D108 on NiV-M G and ephrin B2, respectively [18] , which imparts affinity and stabilizes the receptor-bound complex [22] . This hydrogen bond is involved in an area that contains salt bridges and other hydrogen bonds. The Q388R mutation is close to the T385A and K386E found on the NiV-B strain, which could explain why the NiV-B strain is not efficiently neutralized by mAb 213. Interestingly, this epitope is also missing in a recently described HNV isolated from a Ghanaian bat, suggesting that this virus would not be susceptible to neutralization by mAb 213 [22, 23] .",

In a more recent study, we have shown that mutations at V507 and D582 on the NiV-M and HeV G, respectively, did not result in significant differences in replication in vitro [12] . Here we expanded this finding by testing the in vitro replication of 5 other neutralization-escape mutants. Although at least 2 of these mutations were located within the receptor-binding domain, no changes in propagation were detected, but a change at R516K resulted in a lower titer at 18 hours after infection, suggesting that entry may have been affected by this mutation. While virus replication was not affected in cell culture, significant attenuation was observed for some mutants in the hamster model. Several neutralization-escape mutations in NiV-M G resulted in a significant delay in time to death (4-6 days).
