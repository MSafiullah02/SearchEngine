            "text": "There are only a handful of proteins for which there is a consensus that they form channels (for reviews see [8], [9], [12], [13]). Mentioning the proteins in brief, one of the proteins is M2 from influenza A [14], [15]. It is now established that M2 is a proton channel [16], [17], [18]. It is now also suggested that the mode of action rather correlates with the one of a proton transporter [19]. Other channels from influenza B are reported to conduct protons, such as BM2 [20], or ions, such as NB [21]. Protein p7 from HCV [22], [23], 2B from Polio virus [24], 3a [25] and E protein [26] from SARS-CoV are potential channel proteins. Plant viruses also encode a complement of a potassium channel, Kcv [27], [28]. Vpu from HIV-1 is heavily debated whether it is forming a channel or whether this is just one of its roles in the cellular life cycle. Possibly on the boarder-line of being a channel with a stable more or less defined diameter is Vpr from HIV-1. Vpr has been shown to exhibit channel activity [29], [30]. It is also considered that the protein harbors the capability to traverse through the membrane [31].",

More recent experiments were done with Polio virus indicating that upon 2B deletion permeability of infected HeLa cells to outside compounds is reduced [1]. Permeability essays reveal that a cut-off in size for the permeating substrates exists [35], [36].

Ion channels show more or less precise ion selectivity and gating and can be selectively blocked by small molecules. The mode of action can be triggered either by voltage gradients of small molecule ligands or mechanical stress. The consequence of channel activity is an alteration of electrochemical gradients across those lipid membranes which harbor the proteins. Channels are mostly found to be involved in the electrochemical signal transduction in nerve fibers and in the brain or they are taking part of the signal transformation cascade in the retina. In general they are involved in a very specified mode of action which is driven by their ion selectivity and specific mode of activation.",

The modes of action as for peptide antibiotics may find only limited applicability to describe the mode of action of the channel proteins. The way of how these proteins can assemble needs to be considered in more detail for suggesting a solution. For a single TMD it is hard to envision that in a homooligomeric assembly some of them suddenly may induce the formation of lipoidic pores such as the peptide antibiotics whilst the others are not. It rather remains interesting to analyze whether the formation may lead to a \u2018pore\u2019 or \u2018channel\u2019 at all. With two TMDs within a protein one helix could eventually behave \u2018detergent\u2019 like. 2B from Poliovirus may show such a dual-type of TMD system [49]. With 3 TMDs, such as in 3a from SARS-CoV, it may be worthwhile to compare the channel proteins with the larger host channels. The question remains whether we see a range of possible features where each of the features is limited to one particular protein. Or is it possible that a single protein covers multiple features and behaves channel/porin or detergent-like?",

            "text": "Based on a recent investigation it has been suggested that at least one of the proteins, may show a channel\u2013pore dualism [40]. The proposal is based on conductivity experiments with a peptide representing the first 32 amino acids of Vpu from HIV-1, Vpu1\u201332, reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers. The peptide, assumed to form bundles, shows conductance pattern in aqueous solutions of different alkali salts which reflect very weak selectivity. Selectivity in the pore is not driven by any strong electrostatic interaction of the permeating ion and the pore wall. It is also observed that the conductance is due to the simultaneous flow of cations and anions during an opening event. This will not allow for high selectivity and needs the respective pore diameter to be wide enough so that possibly also small molecules may permeate. Such an idea is supported by findings for 2B from Polio virus with 2 TMDs, where the pore size of the potential pore allows for size dependent substrate diffusion [35]. Structural data of the membrane morphology of 2B are not yet available. It is still an option for the 2B channel to adopt a \u2018carpet\u2019 like morphology [47] with one of the helices lying onto or strongly exposed to the membrane surface. A similar topology and uncertainty of membrane morphology like for 2B holds for p7 from HCV. In the case of the latter experimental data from cryo electron microscopic suggest that the two TMDs align antiparallel when in detergent environment [50]. Again, the question remains, whether this is the only morphology or can p7 also adopt various conformations under specific in vivo conditions. The concept of a weak channel with the consequence of a channel\u2013pore dualism may not hold for all channels. With increasing TMDs per monomer, the likely-hood may vain. Hither forth the name \u2018channel\u2019 is used for the proteins for simplicity.",

TMD1 of TASK overlaps with 19 amino acids followed by BST-2 and MscL both showing 17 amino acids overlap of their TMD and TMD2, respectively. The nAChR and 3a still align 17 and 16 amino acids, respectively, with Vpu6\u201327. For nAChR the match is most pronounced for M2 (sequence A/D) followed by M3 with a match of 16 amino acids (sequences C and E).

For pFC the match is with the P segment which if fully embedded in the structure (Fig. 3C). A match with the pore lining domains is only found for two of the segments of the nAChR (Fig. 3B). Also for ClyA the matching segment \u03b1A is a pore facing part of the giant pore (Fig. 3A). In most of the cases the TMD of Vpu matches with outside or embedded TMDs of the channels. For nAChR a duality is detected. It is concluded that the motif of the TMD of Vpu most likely harbors the capability of diffusing as a non-channel with some expertise to form a conducting channel. Channel formation need possibly specific conditions in vivo, such as lipid composition and dynamics or possibly also co-factors such as host membrane proteins or rafts to adopt a fully functional pore. For 3a the pore lining TMD is still to be elucidated, however the proposal of a match with TMD1 does not match with a proposed model in which TMD3 is pore lining [62] (Fig. 3C).",

In this method positioning is done for the backbone structure of a specific helix. The backbone structure is derived from a classical MD simulation of the monomer or monomeric unit embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer. All the structures from the MD simulation are due to a principle component analysis (PCA). The frames belonging to the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix are averaged and used in the assembly method. Positioning is based on a rotational matrix for the C\u03b1 atoms in which rotational symmetry, tilt and rotation is altered with an angle and step widths chosen by the operator. In the assembly protocol for each positioning the side chains are consequently \u2018attached\u2019 to the individual C\u03b1 atoms on the bases of the most probably configuration taken from the software data base (MOE, www.chemcomp.com). At this stage short energy minimization steps follow and the models are ranked according to their potential energy. Structural integrity [76] or ion selectivity [77] of selected models can be further assessed stressing MD simulation techniques.",

Most likely it seems that possibly two TMDs approach each other followed by either monomeric or dimeric TMDs and also oligomeric units. Along this line investigations have been conducted in which the alignment of the monomeric units of the three TMDs of 3a follows the so call sequential pathway (Hsu and Fischer; to be published).",

Also the TMDs of these proteins may harbor potential target sites as has been shown recently with experiments for M2 of influenza A on a structural level [65], [66]. The antiviral drug amantadine has been detected inside the tetrameric bundle of M2 [65] which is in accordance with other experimental [80], [81], [82] and computational evidence [83]. In a most recent solid state NMR investigation amantadine is found at both an inside and outside pose [84]. The outside location of amantadine is detected to be on the \u2018surface of the protein\u2019 which is in contrast to the reported outside binding site of rimantadine which is identified to be at the protein\u2013lipid interface [66]. A detailed evaluation of the currently ongoing controversy over the drug binding site in M2 is reviewed elsewhere [85]. The conclusion from the current discussion in the field is that for future modeling of drug\u2013protein interaction the lipid environment has to be more thoroughly taken into account in drug development.",

Here \u2018within\u2019 means the lipid membrane with the drugs preventing the oligomerization of the target protein either with itself or with the host. These \u2018anti-oligomerization\u2019 drugs (AODs) may either be peptides (anti-oligomerization peptide drugs (AOPDs), mimicking the potential interaction-partner in its sequence and conformation, or again small molecule drugs derived from conventional sources such as drug design, derivatives of existing drugs or herbs. Since screening for drug candidates needs to take the environment of the lipid membrane more thoroughly into account, this consequently imposes novel aspects on the docking approach. Peptide drugs have so far been reported to be a successful approach when interfering with the mode of action of fusion proteins from paramyxoviruses [98], HBV [99] or gp41 from HIV-1 [100] and one of HIV's entry receptor protein [101]. In all cases the peptide drug mimics parts of the viral fusion protein. Also membrane active proteins such as Nef from HIV are suggested to be the target of antiviral peptide drugs [102].",

In the latter case the protein consists of multi TMDs or as in the case of a single TMD (M2 from influenza A) is covalently coupled to a neighboring protein of the same kind (dimer of a dimer). Thus, increasing number of TMDs goes alongside with specificity. The single TMD protein Vpu shows motifs similar to pore lining helices but most likely also motifs of outer helices of large ion channels, which surround the pore lining helices. This supports a dual mode of action.",
