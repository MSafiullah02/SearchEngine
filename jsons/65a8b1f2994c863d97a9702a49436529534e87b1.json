            "text": "Coronavirus is one of the most important common human and animal pathogens [1] . In December 2019, new coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in China. It spreaded rapidly in China and worldwide within a short time [1] . It is now referred to as Coronavirus disease . It is a highly contagious [2] . The disease is secondary to the coronavirus b family; it has already led to severe epidemics, including SARS-CoV (Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus). The mortality rate of SARS-CoV was about 10% and MERS-CoV was up to 37%. Over the past two decades, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have resulted in more than 10,000 deaths [3, 4] . Some articles have considered pregnant women as a high-risk group of COVID-19 [5] . But the latest data in UptoDate suggest that pregnancy is not an additional risk factor for the infection, and the risk of disease, treatment and prognosis is similar to that of nonpregnants [1] . There is currently no information on foetal maternal or vertical transmission [5] . Although the COVID-19 can affect all age groups, the disease is usually milder in children than in adults, and may be accompanied by non-specific symptoms, especially in neonates [6] . The presentation of COVID-19 in children and neonate can range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress [6] . The most common clinical symptoms include fever, fatigue and dry cough. Some patients have upper respiratory manifestations such as nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and sore throat, and others have gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea [6] . So far, no mortality has been reported in children [7] . The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the contact, travel history and related laboratory tests [6] . Symptomatic and supportive measures, including oxygen, are the main treatment for these patients. Intravenous therapy, correction of water, electrolyte, acid-base imbalances are extremely important as well [6] . Only three newborns have been reported with COVID-19 [1, 6] . These neonates were 36 h, 5 and 17 days old. Their mothers had COVID-19. The disease is rare in neonates, so its suspicioncan help for a quick diagnose.",

He was the third child of non-consanguineous parents; he was born by caesarean section with a birth weight of 3460. His parents recently reported fever and cough. His mother also had sweating, weakness, and malaise. The infant had no history of hospitalisation. At admission, he had fever (38.2 axillaries) and mottling. There were no cough, runny nose or gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination, he was completely alert, with tachycardia (heart rate of 170 min), tachypnoea (respiratory rate of 66), and mild subcostal retraction, O 2 saturation was 93% (without oxygen). He was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) due to illness and respiratory distress. There, he was isolated. The supportive and therapeutic care began. Proper fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, antibiotic therapy by Vancomycin (10 mg/kg/q8h made by Exir Pharmaceutical Co., Iran) and Amikacin (10 mg/kg/ q8h made by Caspian Tamin Pharmaceutical Co., Iran) and Oseltamivir (3 mg/kg/12h made by John Lee Pharmaceutical Co., India) started. Blood tests were done. Then pharyngeal swab specimens were taken to evaluate for coronavirus and influenza by Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Chest X-ray was performed. Consultation with paediatric cardiologist was requested. According to the Iranian Ministry of Health guidelines for Novel coronavirus, cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalisation, PCR testing is not recommended, so no tests were sent to his parents. The results of the patient's test were:",

Only three newborns with the Novel coronavirus were reported, by 1 March 2020 [6] . Case one was 17-day-old with fever, cough and vomiting [8] , the second case was 5-day-old with fever [6] , and the third case was 36-h asymptomatic [5] . These neonates had a positive history of COVID-19 in their mothers. All three infants had stable vital signs and no serious complications were reported [6] . An important finding of our neonate, consistent with the others, was the presence of fever and a positive history of COVID-19 in their parents. But our case had no vomiting and cough despite respiratory distress and mottling. Mottling was not reported in any neonatal case. The uncomplicated discharge of these neonates, like ours, indicates a good prognosis of COVID-19 in the neonatal age group. Therefore, in neonates with non-specific symptoms of infection, and history of COVID-19 symptoms in their parents, performance of PCR testing for Novel coronavirus seems reasonable. Especially at this age, clinical and laboratory symptoms can vary.",
