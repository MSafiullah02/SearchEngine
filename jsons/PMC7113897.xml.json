While IBV has been detected in other avian species, including guinea fowl (Numida meleagridis), partridge (Alectoris sp.), peafowl (Pavo cristato) and the blue-winged teal (Anas sp.), clinically detectable disease has only been observed in chickens (Liu et al., 2005; Cavanagh, 2007; Sun et al., 2007).",

The genes encoding the structural proteins are S (spike glycoprotein), E (envelope glycoprotein), M (membrane glycoprotein) and N (nucleocapsid protein) (Ignjatovic et al., 1997; Cavanagh, 2007), while the 3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b genes encode accessory proteins (Liu et al., 1991; Liu & Inglis, 1992a, b; Cao et al., 2008; Hewson et al., 2011; Bentley et al., 2013), the functions of which are still unknown (Liu et al., 2008). The S glycoprotein is a virion surface, rod-shaped protein that is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 (Cavanagh, 1981; Stern & Sefton, 1982; Cavanagh, 2007).",

The polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab) are then translated, and the papain-like (PLP) and 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) proteases are released from these polyproteins after an auto-catalytic process. These proteases initiate the cleavage in trans of the 15 peptides contained in pp1a/pp1ab. These peptides, probably together with some cellular proteins, form the replication\u2013transcription complex. This initiates the transcription of a series of 3\u2032 nested subgenomic RNAs that are translated into the viral structural and accessory proteins (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Liu & Brown, 1995; Tibbles et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1998; Ziebuhr et al., 2001; Ziebuhr, 2005).",

Previous studies (Hewson et al., 2012) have demonstrated that the VicS vaccine contains two subpopulations, referred to as VicS-v (the predominant subpopulation in the vaccine) and VicS-del, which has a 40-nucleotide deletion in the 3\u2032 UTR and multiple single-nucleotide differences in the structural protein genes compared with VicS-v (Hewson et al., 2012). These viral subpopulations differ in their ability to replicate in vitro and in their pathogenicity in vivo. In VicS-v inoculated groups, all the birds exhibit clinical signs, including head shaking and eye scratching/irritation, from day 2 to day 8 post-inoculation, whereas in the VicS-del inoculated group the clinical signs are less severe and only seen between days 6 and 9 post-inoculation. Birds inoculated with VicS-v also have significantly more severe tracheal lesions than those inoculated with VicS-del.",

During infection 3CL, the main protease, is auto-catalytically released (Ziebuhr et al., 2001; Ziebuhr, 2005). There may be an interaction between the 3CL (nsp5), the TM2 (nsp4) and the TM3 (nsp6) hydrophobic domains (Ziebuhr, 2005), which are also referred to as MP1 and MP2 (Tibbles et al., 1996), during this proteolytic process. The importance of TM3/MP2, the transmembrane domain downstream of the 3CL proteinase, in the autocatalytic processing of 3CL has been suggested by in vitro assays (Tibbles et al., 1996). In this experiment, the further processing of a 66-kDa immature protein product into smaller, post-translationally cleaved products of 59, 42, 35 and 24 kDa (with the 35-kDa peptide the size predicted for the fully processed form of 3CL protease) did not occur if these two hydrophobic domains were not associated with microsomal membranes. Changes in TM3/MP2, such as those detected in VicS-del, could affect the membrane association of this domain and thus the conformation of the protein, and the autocatalytic release of 3CL, which is essential for the initial stages of replication (Ziebuhr, 2005).",

The difference in the proportions of each of the non-synonymous codons between the VicS-v and VicS-del populations, with a greater prevalence of the truncation phenotype in the VicS-del population, suggests that truncation of the S2 protein may be related to the difference in virulence between these strains. The carboxyl terminal end of S2 anchors the S protein to the virion and also assists in membrane fusion with target cells (Cavanagh, 2007). Alternatively, the differing B-TRS sequences, CUGAACAA and CUUAACAA, which have both been identified previously in IBV (Mondal & Cardona, 2007; Woo et al., 2010), may differ in their efficiency in regulating replication and transcription and thus may influence production of mRNA 3, which encodes the E protein. In the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus the deletion of the E protein results in a replication-competent, propagation-defective virus (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013). A nine amino acid truncation, resulting from the nucleotide change from U to G, has been described previously in an M41 strain variant, M41H (Kusters et al., 1989). While these alternative codons have also been found in other IBV strains, the methods used for sequence determination would have precluded identification of differing subpopulations within these strains, as cloned, single cDNA molecules were used for sequencing.",

This divergence has been shown previously in the structural genes (Yu et al., 2001; Bochkov et al., 2007), but this is the first study to show that the divergence can be seen consistently throughout the genome. However, most of the fully sequenced IBV genomes are of strains with an origin in the USA or China, as only a few QX-type and QX-like strains (which now predominate in Europe) have been fully sequenced, and this bias could have influenced the topology of the tree. These European strains were represented in this tree by strains from Italy (Ita/90254/2005) and Sweden (Ck/Swe/0658946/10). The phylogenetic tree constructed with the nucleotide sequences of the S1 protein (Figure 4) includes more QX-type and QX-like strains, including Ck/UK/KG3P/10 and Ck/UK/3355/09 (UK), Ck/Ger/GB1835/10 (Germany), Ck/Swe/0658946/10 and Ck/Swe/082066/10 (Sweden), Ita/90254/2005 (Italy) and Ck/Sp/170/09 and La/Sp/116/09 (Spain). Phylogenetic trees of individual ORFs (Figures 3, 4 and 5) indicate that different regions of the VicS-v genome varied in their similarity to the two major clusters, suggesting historical recombination events. However, this seems very unlikely to have happened recently, based on the results from the network tree analysis (Figure 6). VicS-v diverged and evolved as a distinct cluster, with the length of the VicS-v branches, especially in the 3CL, Hel and RdRp phylogenetic trees, suggesting more rapid evolution than most other strains.",

The differences in the replication rate and pathogenicity of these two viral subpopulations may be attributable to the mutation in the TM3 domain in nsp6 and the SNP found at the end of the S glycoprotein gene, described in this study for the first time. These newly described differences are additional to the previously described frameshift/truncation of the ORF 4b and the 40-nucleotide deletion in the 3\u2032 UTR in VicS-del (Hewson et al., 2012). Further analyses of the complete genome sequences of other Australian IBV strains may reveal additional information about relationships between these distinct vaccine strains and IBVs within the USA and Chinese clusters. Additional investigation of the effect of the differences between the VicS-v and VicS-del strains described in this study may shed more light on the replication and pathogenicity of IBV and may also indicate whether the naturally attenuated strain VicS-del and other strains with similar mutations have potential as novel vaccine candidates for the control of IBV infections.",
