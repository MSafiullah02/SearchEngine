            "text": "High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) (also known as amphoterin or HMG1) was originally defined as a non-histone nucleosomal protein that is important for the regulation of transcription. It is a 215 amino-acid protein, encoded on chromosome 13q12, which is highly conserved between species (99% species homology between rodents and humans). HMGB1 contains two internal repeats of positively charged domains, the A- and B-Box, in the N terminus, and a negatively charged COOH terminus (Figure 1). The two boxes bind to the minor groove of chromatin, thus modifying DNA architecture.1 This facilitates the binding of regulatory protein complexes to DNA such as V(D)J recombinases2 and p53\u2013p73 transcriptional complexes.3, 4, 5 In its resting state, the acidic tail of HMGB1 interacts with specific residues in the A-Box and B-Box, forming an extended and flexible segment, shielding them from other interactions that might occur before HMGB1 binds DNA.6 HMGB1 likely has a role in DNA repair and replication. HMGB1 overexpression, which is observed in many tumors, accelerates cell cycle progression, and recent data suggest that endogenous HMGB1 is a critical pro-autophagic protein that enhances cell survival7 and that HMGB1-induced autophagy promotes chemotherapy resistance in leukemia cells.8",

(1999) in a mouse model of endotoxaemia that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages release HMGB1, but later than secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin 1 (IL-1), and that protection against endotoxin lethality could be obtained by administration of anti-HMGB1 antibodies9 has revealed that HMGB1 is a proinflammatory mediator able to alert the immune system to tissue damage and to trigger an immediate response. The term \u2018alarmin' has been proposed to differentiate the endogenous molecules that are very rapidly released or produced in response to microbial infection or tissue injury, and act as potent effectors of innate defense.10 Alarmins have antimicrobial, enzymatic or chromatin-binding activities and they share common features, including their rapid passive release from necrotic cells or secretion from cells of the innate immune system (macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells) in response to infection, they bind to TLRs and receptors of antigen-presenting cells such as DCs, thus promoting adaptive immunity, and they are involved in the reconstruction of tissues destroyed secondary to inflammation.11 Based on these criteria, a list of putative alarmins has been proposed, including the defensins, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, thymosins, annexins, HSPs, or IL-1\u03b1.12 HMGB1 remarkably fulfills these criteria and it is probably the best-characterized alarmin. The crucial role of HMGB1 not only in response to infection, injury and inflammation, but also its pathological effects in many diseases have recently challenged important questions regarding its biological activities and pathological effects.",

            "text": "During microbial infection, the activation of innate immune responses by DNA and RNA is essential to protective immune responses and is mediated by the transmembrane TLRs and cytosolic receptors.23 TLRs belong to a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have essential roles in innate immunity. They are a class of single-membrane-spanning receptors that have the ability to recognize structurally conserved molecules from bacteria. Engagement of TLRs activates the immune response. HMGB proteins bind to all immunogenic nucleic acids and have recently been identified to serve as universal sentinels for nucleic-acid-mediated innate immune responses.24 Activation of macrophages or DCs with microbial cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG)-DNA, resulting in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, involves TLR9 initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mechanism of TLR activation by CpG-DNA was recently discovered and HMGB1 was found to have a crucial role. HMGB1 binds to CpG-DNA and receptor for advanced glycated endproducts (RAGE), the first identified receptor for HMGB1, and this DNA\u2013protein complex preassociates with TLR9 in the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment, thus accelerating the delivery of microbial DNA to TLR9 and leading to the recruitment of the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88.25 Thus, HMGB1 and RAGE are pivotal for TLR9-dependent induction of genes encoding type I interferon after stimulation of DCs with DNA-containing complexes. Ablation or depletion of HMGB1 impairs redistribution of TLR9 to early endosomes in response to CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), leading to a decreased response to CpG-ODN, but which could be complemented by extracellular HMGB1.25 In addition, HMGB1 was found to be a key factor in immune complex-triggered activation of autoreactive B cells and the induction of type I interferon by plasmacytoid DCs, thus possibly contributing to SLE.25",

Wang et al.9 first reported that HMGB1 was liberated from macrophages stimulated with LPS, and that HMGB1 had an important role in experimental sepsis. HMGB1 secretion from LPS-primed macrophages was shown to require the inflammasome components apoptotic speck protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase 1 and NALP3.28 Monocytes, macrophages and immature DCs (mDCs) secrete HMGB1 in response to LPS, TNF-\u03b1, or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation.29 IFN-\u03b3 can induce HMGB1 release from macrophages that, at least in part, requires induction and signaling through TNF-\u03b1.30 Secretion of a nuclear protein requires a tightly controlled relocation program. Several forms of post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation and oxidation result in the accumulation of HMGB1 in the cytosol.31, 32, 33, 34 Upon activation with LPS, monocytes and macrophages acetylate HMGB1 extensively, allowing its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytosol, and further concentration into secretory lysosomes.35 Thus, because it does not contain a leader sequence, HMGB1 is secreted via a non-classical vesicle-mediated secretory pathway.",

Thus, DAMP is released and can work, but briefly and in a short range, until it gets oxidized. This restricts its activity temporally and spatially, preventing a prolonged stimulation of its targets and thereby limiting inflammation.39",

In addition, HMGB1 protects the conformation of CXCL12 in a reducing environment, a state existing in the draining lymph node. However, only a partial inhibition of DC migration was observed in the presence of a CXCL12 inhibitor or HMGB1 A box, suggesting that multiple receptors are responsible for mediating the DC response to the HMGB1/CXCL12 complex. An interesting study performed in CD24-deficient mice revealed how the host distinguishes between danger versus pathogen PAMPs.45 The proinflammatory activity of HMGB1 is regulated by CD24, which associates with HMGB1, thus inhibiting NF-kappa B activation occurring through CD24 association with Siglec-10. Thus, this CD24-Siglec-10 pathway protects the host against a lethal response to pathological cell death, but it would allow an appropriate response to invading pathogens.45",

Analysis of conjugates between DCs and T cells revealed the recruitment of HIV and its receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 to DC\u2013T cell junction, thus facilitating transmission of HIV during the formation of an infectious synapse in the absence of antigen-specific signaling.55 This process, known as \u2018trans-infection', takes place when part of the virus evades classical degradation pathways, being maintained in endosomal acidic compartments, thus retaining viral infectivity for long periods and promoting efficient HIV transfer to CD4 T cells.56, 57 Trans-infection ability may be restricted to mDCs that display a greater ability to capture incoming virions, retain them in an infectious form in large vesicles within the cells, and transmit them to target CD4+ T cells,58, 59 thus augmenting viral dissemination in the lymphoid tissues and significantly contributing to HIV disease progression.

In addition, they can interact with T cells and DCs to shape the magnitude and quality of adaptive immune responses.66, 67, 68 Following tissue invasion by pathogens and subsequent initiation of inflammatory responses, NK cells migrate to lymphoid tissues in response to the chemokines IL-8 and fractalkine (CX3CL1). In a mouse model, Lucas et al.69 showed that, in vivo, naive NK cells do not acquire effector function unless a priming step has occurred by contact with DCs in draining lymph nodes. The requirements for NK priming was independent of IL-12 and it included secretion of IFN-\u03b1 by TLR+ cells, which induced upregulation of IL-15R\u03b1 and IL-15 expression by DCs, and trans-presentation of IL-15 by DCs to NK cells in the lymph node. NK cells are not fully activated during priming by DCs, as they do not spontaneously produce IFN-\u03b3 or mediate cytotoxicity. Full activation of NK cells requires an additional contact with mDCs. This results in mutual activation of previously primed NK cells and DC,70 and in the release of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells, thus contributing to antigen-driven T-cell activation.71 Blocking of IL-12 abolishes DC-induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion by NK cells, whereas membrane-bound IL-15 on DCs is essential for NK cell proliferation and survival72 (Figure 2).",

This process involves inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptors specific for the non-classical HLA-E molecules.74 mDCs are resistant to NK killing due to the upregulation of HLA class I expression including HLA-E.79 mDCs also upregulate an array of additional surface molecules including CCR7, CD80, CD86 and HLA class II, which allow their migration to lymph nodes and their optimal interaction with T cells during their priming phase. Thus, during the early phases of inflammation, DC maturation is under the control of NK cells that have a major role in keeping in check the quality of DC undergoing maturation (Figure 2).",

Semino et al.80 showed that NK cells trigger immature DCs to polarize and secrete IL-18 at NK\u2013DC synaptic cleft, thus instructing NK cells to release HMGB1, which promotes DC maturation and protects DCs from lysis. Interestingly, the ability of different NK cell subsets to induce DC maturation is unlinked to their phenotypic and cytolytic features but correlates with the relocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is strongly enhanced by engagement of the surface molecule NKp30.81 Moreover, in the presence of DC-derived cytokines, such as IL-12, a cooperation between NKp30 and DNAM-1 to induce NK cells to kill DCs, release TNF-\u03b1 and promote DC maturation were evidenced.82 HMGB1 shows a nuclear localization in primary resting NK cells sorted from the blood, and the NK cell activation induces HMGB1 relocalization from the nucleus to the cytosol followed by extracellular release.21 During the cross talk between activated NK (aNK) cells and iDC, both NK cells and DCs express HMGB121 that appears essential for the upregulation of CD80, CD83 and CD86 maturation markers on DCs and for IL-12 production. The HMGB1 secreted during NK\u2013DC cross talk is also essential for Th1 polarization of na\u00efve CD4 T cells, and RAGE is required for HMGB1 effects on DCs.43, 21 Moreover, the autocrine/paracrine release of HMGB1 is required for the upregulation on DCs of the CCR7 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors and their migration in response to the chemokines receptor ligands CCL19 and CXCL12, respectively,40 and RAGE has a nonredundant role in DC homing to lymph nodes, as shown in mice by noninvasive imaging by magnetic resonance.41 Overall, HMGB1\u2013RAGE pathway is activated in DCs that are committed to maturation in peripheral tissues, and it controls the expression of chemokine receptors in DCs that acquire the ability to reach secondary lymphoid organs where they initiate the clonal expansion of Ag-specific T cells. The disruption of HMGB1-RAGE pathway by specific inhibitors43, 21 or the genetic deletion of RAGE41 interrupts this circuit, possibly limiting the initiation of T-cell adaptive response.",

This inhibitory effect of HMGB1 was caused by repression of LTR-mediated transcription.83 Extracellular HMGB1 also showed a dichotomic effect in different cell types. Addition of HMGB1 to primary monocytes with active HIV-1 infection was reported to suppress viral replication, associated19 or not associated20 to HMGB1-mediated increased release of \u03b2-chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2), strong inhibitors of HIV entry. In contrast, extracellular HMGB1 increased HIV-1 replication in the chronically infected monocytic cell line U1,19 a process that did not require de novo protein synthesis.84 HIV-1 induction relied on HMGB1-RAGE interaction, involved p38, ERK and NF-\u03baB pathway, and stimulated the release of TNF-\u03b1.84 Interestingly, HMGB1 could reactivate ex-vivo quiescent HIV-1 from latently infected PBMC collected in aviremic HIV-infected patients.84 Thus, HMGB1 may reduce viral replication in acute infection by inducing inhibitors of viral entry, but it may trigger viral replication in latently infected cells, including in cells from HIV-infected patients.",

Blocking HMGB1 with specific antibodies or glycyrrhizin, a specific inhibitor of HMGB1, impaired maturation of infected DCs. However, the cross talk between HIV-1-infected DCs and aNK cells was functionally defective, as demonstrated by the strong impairment of DCs to induce Th1 polarization of na\u00efve CD4 T cells. This was associated with the defective production of IL-12 and IL-18 by infected DCs, known to trigger the adaptive response.21 Moreover, the interaction between aNK and HIV-1-infected DCs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral DNA expression in DCs. This process was mainly triggered by HMGB1, released both by NK cells and DCs, and blocking HMGB1 strongly inhibited HIV replication in both isolated infected DCs and DCs cocultured with aNK cells21 (Figure 4). Thus, these findings provide evidence for the crucial role of NK\u2013DC cross talk in promoting viral dissemination, and challenge the question of the in vivo involvement of HMGB1 in the triggering of HIV-1 replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs in AIDS.",

Indeed, NK cells from viremic patients show a decreased ability to kill immature DCs.87 The defect is associated with an increase in the proportion of CD56\u2212 NK cells with impaired NKp30 function.86 In addition, increased production of IL-10 during HIV-1 infection can protect immature DCs from NK cell-mediated lysis, resulting in accumulation of partially mature, poorly immunogenic DCs in the lymph nodes of infected individuals.88 In an ex-vivo model of NK\u2013DC cross talk, we showed that HIV-1-infected DCs become resistant to NK cell-mediated lysis due to an upregulation in DCs of two apoptosis inhibitors, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2).22 The expression of these inhibitors was upregulated by HMGB1, released by aNK cells at NK\u2013DC synapse, and they protected HIV-1-infected DCs from TRAIL-dependent apoptosis.22 Blocking HMGB1 with specific antibodies restored the susceptibility of infected DCs to NK killing, and similar effect was observed knocking down c-FLIP or c-IAP2 by siRNA22 (Figure 5). Overall, these findings suggest that impaired NK\u2013DC cross talk during HIV-1 infection is a consequence of bidirectional alteration of both DC and NK cell functions, and they reveal the pivotal role of HMGB1 in HIV-1 persistence in DCs.",

HMGB1 has a pivotal role during NK\u2013DC cross talk but, in the context of a chronic viral infection such as that induced by HIV-1, it triggers viral replication in DCs and blocks NK-mediated killing of infected DCs, thus contributing to viral persistence. Increased circulating HMGB1 levels are detected in progressive HIV-1-infected individuals and, in combination with microbial products and TLR ligands, it may also contribute to gut inflammation and subsequently increase microbial translocation and chronic immune activation, a hallmark of HIV-1 disease progression. In order to get a better understanding on the role of HMGB1 in HIV disease and to develop interventions aimed at enhancing immunity to HIV-1, several major questions need to be addressed.",

It is organized in three domains made up by two positively charged homologous DNA-binding structures (A and B box), and a negatively charged acidic tail composed of 30 glutamic and aspartic acids, exclusively. There are two positively charged nuclear-localization signals, including amino-acid sequence segments 28\u201344 for NLS1 and 179\u2013185 for NLS2. Amino-acids 50\u2013183 segment in the C-terminus of HMGB1 is responsible for RAGE binding. The extracellular cytokine activity resides within the B box, and it can be antagonized by truncated A box domain. The cysteine in position 106 in the B box is indispensable for HMGB1 to activate cytokine release, as shown by selective mutation. The C-terminal acidic tail is required for transcription stimulatory function of HMGB1. (b) The primary HMGB1 sequence is 98.5% identical in all mammals. Comparison of human HMGB1 to the murine counterpart shows two differences in the acidic tail and one amino-acid change in the B box, whereas bovine HMGB1 shows only one amino-acid change in the acidic tail, and canine HMGB1 shows 100% homology with human HMGB1 (adapted from Murua Escobar et al.96)",

The disruption of an epithelial barrier allows invasion of microbial pathogens, which elicit an innate response at the site of infection (1). Neutrophils and macrophages infiltrate the site of tissue infection and release alarmins, including HMGB1 (2). HMGB1 recruits iDCs, resulting in an increase in local mobilization of iDCs (3). Functional DC maturation requires a cross talk with NK cells, which involves HMGB1 expressed at NK\u2013DC synapse (4). Immature to mDC conversion allows DCs to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs (5) and contributes to the enhanced uptake, processing and presentation of microbial antigens to na\u00efve T cells, thus polarizing a Th1 response (6). This T-cell response involves IL-12 and IL-18 released by mDCs. Cognate interaction between NK cells and DCs may also lead to the selective killing of DCs that are not appropriate for antigen presentation to T cells (7). This editing process, which involves TRAIL, allows NK cells to control the quality of DCs, thus regulating adaptive immunity",

This bidirectional cross talk that involves NK receptors NKp30 and CD94/NKG2A, leads both to NK cell activation (2) and DC maturation (3), through the release of cytokines by both cells. In addition, HMGB1 produced both by NK cells and DCs, has a pivotal in NK-dependent DC maturation. During HIV-1 infection, NK\u2013DC cross talk is impaired. NK cell activation is altered and HMGB1-dependent DC maturation is incomplete. Cognate interaction of infected iDCs with NK cells leads to their phenotypic maturation, as evidenced by the expression of maturation markers, including CD80, CD83 or CD86 (3), but not to their functional maturation shown by the inability of DCs to polarize a Th1 response in na\u00efve T cells (4). This functional impairment is associated with the absence of release by DCs of IL-12 and IL-18 required for Th1 induction. Moreover, cognate NK\u2013DC interaction leads to the increase of HIV-1 replication in infected DCs and to the accumulation of DCs with proviral DNA (5). The triggering of HIV-1 replication in DCs is mediated by HMGB1. Thus, HMGB1 contributes to HIV-1 dissemination and persistence",

NK cell-dependent killing of iDCs involves the activating NKp30 receptor (1) and the DR4/TRAIL death receptor pathway (2). HIV-1 infection induces a defective editing process. NK cells show a decreased ability to kill infected DCs associated with impaired NKp30 expression and TRAIL secretion (3), and infected DCs become resistant to NK-mediated killing due to the upregulation of two anti-apoptotic molecules, c-FLIP and c-IAP2 (4). HMGB1 induces these two potent inhibitors of apoptosis in infected DCs, thus making them resistant to NK killing",

            "text": "Figure 6: Proposed contribution of HMGB1 to HIV persistence and dissemination. HIV disease progression is characterized by gut inflammation and consequently microbial translocation leading to the release of LPS in the bloodstream (1). Circulating LPS may induce active release of HMGB1 by innate cells, including macrophages and DCs (2). Necrotic and apoptotic cells that accumulate during chronic HIV infection may also be a constant source of HMGB1 (3). HMGB1 activates DCs by signaling through the receptor RAGE or TLR4 if cooperate with TLR4 ligand LPS, thus triggering NF-\u03baB activation (4). This results in the release of HMGB1 (5) and proinflammatory cytokines (6), and the triggering of HIV replication in mDCs (7). Trans-infection of HIV from mDCs to CD4 T cells involves HIV capture by DC-SIGN followed by its recruitment at the site of T-cell interaction (8). This infectious synapse will lead to the productive infection of CD4 T cells (9). Trans-infection of HIV can also be mediated by exocytosis of the HIV-1 particles captured by DCs. After endocytosis, the captured HIV-1 particles are targeted to a multi-vesicular endosomal body (MVB) in DCs (10). Although some of the MVB-localized virus fraction is targeted to the lysosome and degraded to be further presented to TCR in the context of MHC molecules, fusion of MVB with the plasma membrane results in the release of virus particles along with exosomes (11). Virus produced by infected CD4 T cells, DCs and macrophages spread the infection to the draining lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissue",
