A virus-borne disease affecting this crustacean called white tail disease (WTD) was first observed and reported in a hatchery in Guadeloupe, then in Martinique, French West Indies (Arcier et al., 1999) and in Taiwan (Tung et al., 1999). Later, WTD was reported in China (Qian et al., 2003, Sri Widada et al., 2003), India (Sahul Hameed et al., 2004) and most recently in Bangkok, Thailand (Yoganandhan et al., 2006). Clinical signs in infected postlarvae include lethargy, opaqueness of abdominal muscles, degeneration of telson and uropods. The mortality may reach 100% within two or three days after the appearance of the clinical sign of opaqueness (Arcier et al., 1999, Sri Widada et al., 2003, Sahul Hameed et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Two viruses, the M. rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) and the extra small virus (XSV), were identified as causative pathogenic agents of WTD (Arcier et al., 1999, Qian et al., 2003). MrNV is a small icosahedral non-enveloped particle, 26\u201327 nm in diameter, identified in the cytoplasm of connective tissue cells. It contains a genome consisting of two linear single stranded positive sense RNA segments, RNA1 of 2.9 kb, which encodes the viral part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA2 of 1.3 kb that encodes the capsid protein. The capsid contains a single polypeptide of 43 kDa (cp-43) (Bonami et al., 2005). XSV is also an icosahedral virus with a diameter of 14\u201316 nm. Its genome consists of a linear single stranded positive sense RNA about 0.9 kb coding for a capsid protein, cp-17 (Qian et al., 2003, Sri Widada et al., 2004). Because of its extremely small size and the absence of a gene which codes for enzymes required for viral RNA replication, it has been suggested that XSV may be a satellite virus, while MrNV plays the role of a helper virus (Sri Widada et al., 2004). The linear correlation between MrNV and XSV genome copies in infected prawns confirmed that XSV is a satellite virus, dependent on MrNV, but its role in the pathogenicity of WTD remains unclear (Zhang et al., 2006).",

            "text": "As there are no effective treatments for these viral pathogens, the spread and impact of white tail disease can be minimized only by adoption of better management practices in hatcheries and farms. Early diagnosis of pathogens in hatcheries is the only way of preventing the development of disease. It is essential, therefore, that sensitive, specific and rapid diagnostic methods be developed for early detection of both pathogenic agents of this disease (Pillai et al., 2006). Various diagnostic methods have been developed for detection of these viruses including histopathology, serological methods, and genome based detection methods. Sandwich ELISA (Romestand and Bonami, 2003) and three genome based methods, i.e., dot blot hybridization, in situ hybridization and RT-PCR (Sri Widada et al., 2003, Sri Widada et al., 2004), are available for detection of WTD. Of these, RT-PCR was found to be the most sensitive and highly specific method for detection of MrNV and XSV (Sri Widada et al., 2003). Although very sensitive and specific, RT-PCR requires the use of a thermal cycler and hence needs a well-equipped laboratory for performance. It is a time consuming process, which takes at least 3\u20135 h to complete. Apart from the sensitivity and rapidity, any detection method developed for M. rosenbergii needs to be economical as unlike the tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon, which has a high fecundity of 0.5\u20131.0 million eggs, M. rosenbergii has a much lower fecundity of 20,000\u201330,000 (Vadher, 2003).",

(2000), was developed for rapid diagnosis of white tail disease in M. rosenbergii (Pillai et al., 2006). There are very few reports of the application of LAMP method for detection of RNA viruses. It is a specific nucleic acid amplification technique that can amplify target nucleic acid to 109 copies at 60\u201365 \u00b0C in 1 h (Notomi et al., 2000, Parida et al., 2004, Savan et al., 2005). The method relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis by the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment, a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity. Using this technique, the presence of the virus can be detected successfully in 1 h by observing the formation of a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate. As the reaction is carried out under isothermal conditions, it can be conducted with a simple and inexpensive water bath (Notomi et al., 2000, Parida et al., 2004, Savan et al., 2005). There is no time loss of thermal change due to the isothermal reaction and the inhibition reaction at the later stage of amplification is less likely to occur, compared with the PCR.",

Each set consisted of four primers, two outer primers (F3 and B3) and two inner primers (FIP and BIP). FIP consisted of two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense (F1) and antisense (F2c) sequences of the target, with a TTTT spacer in between. Similarly, the BIP consisted of the complementary sequence of B1 (B1c), a TTTT spacer and the sense B2 sequence. The FIP and BIP initiate LAMP cycling by structuring the loop while the outer primers initiate the strand displacement of DNA (Notomi et al., 2000). The sequence of primers for MrNV specific to RNA2 and XSV is shown in Table 1, Table 2\n.",

The specificity of amplification of the template was optimum at 63 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C with set VII primer as observed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visually by the formation of a whitish precipitate (Fig. 1\n). Uninfected Macrobrachium sample collected from the wild showed no visible precipitate at these temperatures. However, a slight absorbance was observed in the uninfected sample in the spectrophotometer reading. The results indicated that set I and set II primers were very specific for XSV detection at 63 \u00b0C as well as at 65 \u00b0C. The optimum time required for amplification by RT-LAMP was studied for both MrNV with set VII primers and XSV with set II primers. The results suggested that efficient amplification of template RNA could be obtained within 15\u201345 min (Fig. 2\n).

In this study, extensive standardisation of the RT-LAMP method has been carried out to increase its efficiency and rapidity for the detection of MrNV and XSV in M. rosenbergii. In an earlier study, it was established that the RT-LAMP reaction for the detection of MrNV and XSV works well at 63 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C (Pillai et al., 2006). Further studies with different primer set combinations have again reaffirmed that the optimum temperature for RT-LAMP assay is 63 \u00b0C or 65 \u00b0C. However, since reverse transcriptase is used in the RT-LAMP assay, and considering the convenience of use of the LAMP method for detection of the two viruses simultaneously, all further reactions were carried out at 63 \u00b0C for both MrNV (with set VII primers) and XSV (with set II primers). In their study on detection of West Nile virus by RT-LAMP, Parida et al. (2004) observed the efficiency of amplification to be optimal at 63 \u00b0C.",

The present studies with primer set VII for MrNV showed that amplification begins to occur in 15 min. In the present study, the time to obtain a white precipitate has been reduced to 15 min by the choice of appropriate primers. The time required for initiation of amplification in the case of XSV was also the same as MrNV. The earlier studies by us showed that the accelerated LAMP reaction by the use of loop primers could reduce the time for appearance of the white precipitate to 20 min (Pillai et al., 2006). However, non-specific amplification appeared to be a problem with the use of additional primers (Pillai et al., 2006). Since highly visible whitish precipitate could be obtained with LAMP primer VII by the use of 4 primers in 15 min, loop primers were not used in the present study. The RT-LAMP assay (without loop primers) for MrNV and XSV reported here showed exceptionally high rapidity in comparison with LAMP assays of other RNA and DNA viruses.",

The quantity of white precipitate produced was found to increase with the amount of template used as observed by Caipang et al. (2004). Even though a slight amplification was observed in uninfected sample in spectrophotometer reading, it remained more like background amplification and was not found to increase with the increasing amounts of template. With the LAMP reaction, there was no inhibition of amplification with increasing amounts of template used. This is an advantage of RT-LAMP over RT-PCR since increase in template beyond the optimal level could actually inhibit detection by RT-PCR (Sri Widada et al., 2003, Sahul Hameed et al., 2004).",

The ability of LAMP method to amplify DNA from fewer copies of initial target DNA compared to PCR has been demonstrated conclusively (Gunimaladevi et al., 2004, Gunimaladevi et al., 2005, Kono et al., 2004, Savan et al., 2004, Pillai et al., 2006). Though RT-LAMP has many advantages over RT-PCR, our experience has shown that RT-LAMP needs highly purified template RNA for assay. In an earlier trial, non-specific DNA amplification, including formation of white precipitate, was observed in uninfected samples using RNA without prior DNAse and proteinase treatment. This problem was solved by the use of ultra pure RNA. In their study on detection of food borne salmonella in raw milk by LAMP, Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated very clearly the importance of nucleic acid purity in the LAMP reaction. Another disadvantage of the LAMP assay is that the high sensitivity and very large amount of amplified DNA produced makes it susceptible to false positive reactions because of cross-contamination. Hence, the necessary precautions should be taken during extraction of RNA and preparation of the reaction mix.",
