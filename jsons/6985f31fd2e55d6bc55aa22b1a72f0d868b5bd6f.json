One hundred and sixtyseven animals were treated once orally with 15 mg/kg toltrazuril, and 164 animals served as placebo-treated controls. Two treatment regimes were compared, a metaphylactic (treatment on the day, or 1 day after, turn out) and a therapeutic treatment (4 or 7 days after turn out). During an observation period of 14 days after treatment the animals were clinically examined for diarrhoea and faecal samples were regularly assessed for Eimeria oocysts. Other possible causes of diarrhoea were excluded on the basis of microbiological and virological examination. Animals were predominantly infected with Eimeria alabamensis. Number of days with diarrhoea in animals treated with toltrazuril was significantly lower compared to the placebo-treated group (therapeutic treatment: P=0.0024; metaphylactic treatment: P<0.0001). Furthermore, the number of animals with diarrhoea during the observation period for a minimum of at least 3 days, the number of animals positive for Eimeria oocysts, and the number of animals with both diarrhoea for a period of at least 3 days and positive for Eimeria oocysts, were significantly lower (P<0.01) in the toltrazuril-compared to the placebo-treated animals. Body weight in the toltrazuril-treated animals significantly exceeded that of the placebo-treated animals at the end of the observation period. Mean difference in body weight was higher in the metaphylactic (+7.3 kg) compared to the therapeutic treatment group (+3.4 kg). No adverse reactions were observed. The results indicate that toltrazuril is highly efficacious and safe in the metaphylactic and therapeutic treatment of coccidiosis caused by E. alabamensis in first-year grazing calves.",

In various European investigations E. alabamensis was identified as the dominating species in grazing cattle with clinical coccidiosis.

All other comparisons were carried out by employing a logistic regression model, using covariates age, sex and baseline body weight. The comparison of oocytes per gram of faeces between treatments was carried out using a repeated measures model for binary variables. Weight gain was analysed using an ANCOVA, using covariates age, sex and baseline body weight. For all statistical tests a nominal significance level of 5% (a=0.05) was used.

For northern Germany, reports exist which describe clinical outbreaks as well as the epidemiological situation in grazing cattle on a multi-herd basis (Gr\u00e4fner 1989) . The animals usually showed diarrhoea and weight loss during the first weeks following turn out and occasionally mortality was reported. The pattern of E. alabamensis infections in first-year grazing calves is characterized by significant increases in oocyst counts starting at approximately 7-9 days after turn out (Snoep and Potters 2004) . Infections are considered to be mainly caused by oocysts which persisted on the pasture since the previous grazing season (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1982; Svensson et al. 1993 Svensson et al. , 1994 . The findings of the present study are consistent with this view. In all herds and in nearly all of the calves E. alabamensis oocysts were found and in approximately 80% of the animals clinical coccidiosis was diagnosed. The pathogenic Eimeria species encountered in the present study were E. alabamensis and E. bovis, which were also >> S131 the most prevalent in an earlier study in the GDR (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1982) . Although infection with this pathogen is usually considered to be acquired during the first few days of grazing (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1982; Svensson et al. 1993) , it is also known that calves may be infected before turn out, usually leading to the excretion of low numbers of oocysts. It has been shown that E. alabamensis oocysts can be transmitted by contaminated hay (Svensson 1997) . On several of the farms included in this study, anecdotal reports of calves which died with signs of clinical coccidiosis during the first 2 months following turn out were given. In contrast to E. bovis which can cause significant lesions in the large intestine with morbidity and mortality (Daugschies et al. 1997; Taylor and Catchpole 1994) , E. alabamensis is known to cause clinical cases with lower morbidity (Hooshmand-Rad et al. 1994) . Nevertheless, such natural infections usually contribute to reduced weight gain during the first months of grazing and may occasionally require treatment to avoid a fatal outcome of the disease.",

For example, in Germany, currently only sulphonamides are registered for the treatment of bovine coccidiosis. However, repeated applications of these drugs for several days only result in the reduction of clinical symptoms but are unable to prevent these effectively. Experience with sulphonamide treatment against bovine coccidiosis has been described worldwide. A sulphonamide-bolus-based treatment using a baquiloprim/sulphadimidine bolus has been studied in Sweden and found to have significant effects on reduced weight loss and oocyst output in treated calves (Svensson 1998) . Nevertheless, it is not marketed as a registered product and may be used in niche markets only due to the handling expenses. Other combinations of molecules tested for enhanced efficacy, such as sulphamonomethoxine/ormetoprim (Hasbullah et al. 1996) , are reported to be effective as well. However, a multitude of reports concerning the unsatisfactory efficacy of these combinations in the field reflect the decreased compliance of users for this class of compounds.",

Furthermore, the number of animals with diarrhoea and/or the number of animals positive for Eimeria spp. was significantly lower in animals treated with toltrazuril compared to the placebo-treated animals, and treatment with toltrazuril resulted in a significantly higher body weight compared to placebotreated animals.",

However, possible differences in formulation have to be considered since the off-label use of this compound in the 1990s did not employ the formulation used in the present study. Nevertheless, in both publications a significant reduction in oocyst shedding, as well as an improvement of clinical symptoms, were observed. Furthermore, in the experimental infection model against E. bovis the com-pound proved to be fully effective in a prophylactic application (Mundt et al. 2003) .",
