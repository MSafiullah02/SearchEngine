This brings into question how can an abstract concept such as the gist be computationally extracted and quantified? Due to this abstract nature, there does not exist a common formalism of the gist in psychology, computational linguistics or NLP. In computational linguistics the notion of gist appears in gist preservation for discourse [22] and gisting or summarisation [18]. Our view of the gist differs from these works in the sense that we view the gist as a very high level but low dimensional semantic representation of a text which can novelly be quantified as a real number known as the gist score. To evaluate the predictive capabilities of the gist score we experimentally applying our representation to few-shot document classification and compare the results to existing classical and few-shot classifiers. In particular, we focus on the classification of large documents where documents on average are comprised of thousands of words. Standard datasets for document classification such as Yelp, IMDB, Reuters, etc. contain documents with only hundreds of words on average. As such, few works evaluate large document classification partly due to the fact that neural-based models have large memory requirements to train over documents with large numbers of words or are only trained using sections of the document. Intuition also tells us that extracting and quantifying the gist of a document should be more accurate in longer documents.",

There has been recent interest in applying this methodology to NLP however the nature of language makes the complexity of few-shot learning more difficult. Many approaches to few-shot learning employ some form of transfer or meta-learning which requires supervised learning over related classes. However, in a real-world application where N-shot learning could be applied, it is also unlikely that suitable labelled training data of related classes will exist. Therefore, taking an unsupervised approach to few-shot learning is arguably more important and we show that few-shot learning in NLP can be approached in an unsupervised way by determining the semantic similarity based on our purposed method using the gist score. The fundamental difference in our approach compared to few-shot approaches in computer vision can be seen in the following problem formulations.",

(1) We propose an unsupervised gist representation that provides a link between psychology and computational linguistics which allows for the extraction and quantification of the gist from a text. This acts as a first step towards a possible computational model of FTT. (2) We apply the gist score to few-shot large document classification and experimentally show that our gist representation performs as well as centroid based similarity measures and better than traditional baseline algorithms while effectively only using a one-dimensional representation for each word. This has significant implications towards the dimensionality required for word embeddings by suggesting it is possible to train a greatly reduced embedding while still retaining high accuracy in downstream tasks.",

The concept of gist can also be found in artificial intelligence to explain norm emergence using gist information [10] and for summarising image information using gist descriptors [6], few works attempt to computationally quantify the gist in language. Many computational models were inspired by cognitive models which have been developed and studied in psychology. Our work is closely related to the psychological notion of fuzzy-trace theory (FTT), a well-founded theory that states that reasoning occurs on simple gists rather than exact details [4]. Underlying FTT are seven key principles, the first being gist extraction which is the task of reducing information to its essence. In FTT, it is hypothesised there are two cognitive systems of memory, the verbatim memory and the gist memory. The verbatim memory acts to retain detailed information whereas the gist memory acts to retain only the quintessential information. Therefore, assuming a sequential memory model the gist memory can be thought of as a compressed representation of the verbatim memory. In this paper, we explore a computational model for FTT that allows for the extraction and inference of the gist based on the underlying principles of FTT.",

In particular, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [2] a generative topic model assumes that the distribution of the gist over topics is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. The topic model presents a very structured representation that assumes there exists a strict predefined latent structure and dependencies on how the language was generated, our work differs from this as it assumes no such structure and no distribution over topics. Furthermore, the gist generated from these generative models have no direct application to other downstream tasks. In this paper, we apply our notion of the gist to document classification, the task of determining and assigning the classes of documents. This is an important and well-studied task in NLP with applications in information retrieval and spam identification with many different approaches from term frequency [12], state vector machines (SVM) [11], current state of the art neural-based methods [24] and recent few-shot learning approaches [8, 23].",

Since PCA aims to minimize the MSE and the embedding set follows a power law distribution where a relatively small set of common words occur often, then intuitively p will be chosen such that the MSE is minimized for these common word embeddings. When p is chosen in this way the projected value for the common words will have a lower value as they contribute less to the variation on the first principal component. Conversely, the unique words that corroborate more closely to the gist will have a higher value in the resultant PCA. For example, when reducing the combined C002-C029 texts to 1-dimension via PCA using Word2Vec embeddings the words \u201cpatients\u201d, \u201cphysicians\u201d and \u201cclinicians\u201d have the highest values in both the C002 and C029 segments.

Fundamentally, document classification involves determining the semantic similarity between documents which has been argued to fundamentally be a cognitive modelling problem [14]. Therefore, to some extent computational semantic similarity measures should align to some aspect of human judgement which we aim to do by aligning our method towards principals in FTT. As such, we explore the use of two types of gist known as the local and global gist to compute the gist score. It has been proposed that the gist can be differentiated into two types, the global gist which captures the meaning of an entire event as a whole and the local gist which captures the meaning of a more discrete event [17]. To some extent determining the semantic similarity between documents in a few-shot learning instance should involve both the global and local gist, In Algorithm 3 we employ the local gist to capture the discrete pairwise gist between the query and support documents whereas the global gist captures the query document in relation to the entire support set.\n\n",

Figure 6 and 7 display the effects segment size has on capturing this underlying distribution based on different embedding types. The results show that segment size can significantly improve that initially under-performing GloVe and FastText models to be more comparable but still not better than ELMo and Word2Vec based embeddings. Interestingly, this aligns with psychological experiments where fuzzier gist-based representations are better from making decisions rather than verbatim representations [1]. In both cases, we see that ELMo embeddings are robust in the sense that the accuracy is not greatly affected when the segment size is changed one again. More significantly, when the segment size is one we still get relatively high accuracy for both ELMo and Word2Vec embeddings. This implies that theses embeddings are semantically more meaningful and it is possible to represent each word embedding as a single real number and still achieve accurate results in large document classification. This is a significant implication as in general nearly all the features in the original embeddings are lost in creating the gist embedding however our results show that we can still capture the semantic similarity between documents. This suggests for certain tasks we can feasible train lower dimensional embeddings thus reducing training time and the memory requirements associated with handling large sets of embeddings.\n\n",

The results in Fig. 8 and 9 show that generally the local gist is more effective to perform inferencing on over the global gist in both binary and multiclass classification. This makes sense as the local gist captures the discrete differences between two documents which is a more direct measure for classification opposed to the global gist. When naively combining the local and global gists by averaging, in binary classification the combined gist performs within 2\u20134% better or worse than the local gist whereas in the multiclass case the combined gist performs 2\u201320% better in all cases. Once again, intuition tells us that when there are more classes to compare the global or contextual comparison becomes more important as reflected in the results. This suggests that as the number of classes or size of the support set increases evaluating the pairwise semantic similarity is not sufficient and global or contextual information about other classes can improve accuracy. From a psychological standpoint based on the fuzzy-preference theory, in general the combined gist is the preferred gist representation along the fuzzy-to-verbatim continua which although isn\u2019t that fuzziest representation provides still provide the most information needed for inferencing.\n\n",

As future work, in this paper we assumed a sequential memory model in which the gist representation is created from the verbatim representation, but it is theorised that the gist and verbatim representations are created in parallel in FTT. It would be interesting to explore a model which learns both the verbatim and gist represents of words simultaneously as our work shows that one-dimensional gist representations for words are sufficient for large document classification and can be created from higher dimensional word embeddings, such a representation would be beneficial for memory constrained environments.",
