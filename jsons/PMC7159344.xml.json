There are likely a multitude of pathways in which neurodevelopment can be disrupted, leading to inadequate mood regulation that characterizes BD 3. A multiple\u2010hit model, centred in the perinatal period, has been proposed as a sequence of three events: genetic predisposition acts as \u2018hit 1\u2019 while perinatal environment acts as \u2018hit 2\u2019, giving rise to phenotypes of vulnerability to \u2018hit 3\u2019, that is later life\u2010experiences and exposures 4. Although the mechanistic details are unclear, this sequence of events has been proposed to chronically dysregulate homeostasis, in a process that is thought to involve the immune system 5.",

This chronic immune dysfunction, including activation of cell\u2010mediated immunity, development of autoimmune disorders and systemic inflammation, may be a primary consequence of inflammatory processes and/or result from altered central nervous system integrity, and thus be a reflection of neuroprogression 8, 9.

Associations of BD with Borna disease virus, influenza virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6 and Toxoplasma gondii suggest that these relationships may not be specific to any one pathogen but rather involve a common mechanism, possibly immune activation. Although it has been proposed that some infections act early in life on specific stages of neurodevelopment 22, most studies are still rather inconclusive in this regard. Most research in BD has restricted the detection of infectious stigma to IgG antibodies, which are informative of a previous exposure but not able to identify the particular period of that exposure. These studies are thus insufficient to demonstrate that infections predate the diagnosis of BD, leaving open the possibility that they might even have occurred after onset. In that case, such infections would not be causal for BD, and their increased prevalence could reflect lifestyle\u2010related factors, or even be an epiphenomenon of BD\u2010related genetic backgrounds, that could independently increase liability to infection.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, some studies have provided clearer evidence of infections being associated with a higher risk of developing BD later in life. Parboosing et al 23, suggested that influenza during pregnancy increased the risk of BD in offspring by a factor of approximately 4 [OR: 3.82 (95% CI: 1.58\u20139.24)]. A key advantage of this study is that the infection was measured long prior to onset of BD, indicating that BD was not a consequence of influenza exposure. Moreover, Benros et al. 24, in a population\u2010based analysis in Denmark, have shown that a previous hospitalization for an infectious disease was associated with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.55\u20131.68) for a subsequent BD diagnosis. Additional evidence has similarly suggested that infections occurring during adult life may be associated with BD, probably triggering mood episodes or influencing clinical presentation. One such study demonstrated that anti\u2010Toxoplasma gondii circulating IgM antibody levels were significantly higher in manic patients at hospital admission as compared to healthy controls [OR: 2.33 (95% CI: 1.08\u20135.03)], suggesting a recent infection, and the possibility that even a first contact with this parasite may trigger mood episodes in those susceptible 25. Similarly, another study showed a trend towards an increased prevalence of urinary tract infection in hospital\u2010admitted patients, with approximately 21% of those with BD affected, compared with only 3% of controls [OR: 8.1 (95% CI: 0.9\u201369.3] 26. A nationwide population\u2010based retrospective cohort study in Taiwan found a 2.671 hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI: 1.921\u20133.716) of newly diagnosed BD in subjects with pelvic inflammatory disease, further suggesting that infection/inflammation is a risk factor 27.",

Seminog and Goldacre 28 observed that the risk of pneumococcal disease (lobar pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases) in people hospitalized for BD is 2.3 times higher than in people without a record of hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder [RR: 2.3 (95% CI 2.2\u20132.3)] and that the risk remained high for years after discharge, suggesting an association with the psychiatric disorder rather than with the event of hospitalization. Davydow et al. 29, in a Danish population\u2010based cohort study, found that individuals with serious mental illness (in this study, SZ and BD) are at increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia [IRR: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.66\u20131.79)] and urinary tract infection [IRR: 1.70 (95% CI: 1.62\u20131.78)] and rehospitalization for the same reason within 30 days. In Sweden, in a national cohort study involving 6 587 036 individuals, of which 6618 were diagnosed with BD, the mortality rate from influenza or pneumonia was found to be increased in BD patients when compared to the general population [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) in women: 3.74 (95% CI: 2.39\u20135.88); aHR in men: 4.38 (95% CI: 2.76\u20136.96)] 30. Also, Ribe and collaborators (31) observed that the 30\u2010day mortality after any infection was 52% higher [mortality ratio = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.43\u20131.61)] for individuals with severe mental illness (BD and SZ) than for individuals without 31. Hayes et al. 32, in a recent review and meta\u2010analysis, found that a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.25 (95% CI 1.70\u20133.00) can be attributed to infection in BD. These observations may partly explain the premature mortality in BD, with rates comparable to those of a heavy smoker 33, leaving aside other potential contributors namely risk behaviours, delays in seeking care and/or low adherence to treatment 34, 35, 36, 37.",

Furthermore, by exploring genetic variants of the NOD2 gene, an intracytoplasmic pathogen receptor particularly well described in intestinal inflammatory disorders, the same research group showed that the NOD2 rs2066842 T allele is less prevalent in cases than in controls, seemingly conferring some \u2018protection\u2019 against BD 58. This allele has been described as a \u2018standing\u2019 common variant in Caucasians but rare in other ethnic groups 59. The maintenance of the NOD2 rs2066842 polymorphism in Caucasians (in contrast to other population groups) is believed to be due to selection of heterozygotes by factors that are specific to the Caucasian environment, namely through increased resistance to bacterial infection 60, 61.",

This allele is associated with more prolonged and severe proinflammatory immune responses 80.

According to these results, a model was proposed whereby the TLR2 rs3804099 TT genotype carriers may be more susceptible to inflammation\u2010mediated damage induced by early\u2010life stress, with consequent younger age at onset of BD 91. A subsequent study from the same group, using an independent sample set of modest size, observed a nominal interaction between that TLR2 polymorphism (rs3804099) and Toxoplasma gondii seropositivity (IgG), although the finding did not persist following correction for multiple comparisons 90. Nevertheless, and consistent with these findings, mechanisms of immune priming early in life have been related to the higher vulnerability to subsequent exposure to stress in animal models 92, 93. Avramopoulos et al. 89, using a genomewide approach, also explored potential interactions between infection, determined by plasma IgG antibody against Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and human herpes virus 6, and the genetic background. In this study, no signal reached genomewide significance for BD.",

In addition to the limited sample sizes often used in these studies, reducing statistical power, this may be one of the reasons for not detecting significance in statistical interaction analyses, such as regression analysis. Moreover, these studies were limited to data on IgG antibodies, which is not informative of the \u2018time window\u2019 of exposure, possibly compromising the quality of the analysed environmental measure.

Besides the conceivable existence of a \u2018leaky gut\u2019 contribution to systemic inflammation in mood disorders, systemic inflammation has also been suggested to increase intestinal permeability, possibly through the facilitation of paracellular mechanisms 105. The pleiotropy and wide expression of innate immune receptors such as TLR4, present in brain structures rich in vasculature and lacking a normal blood\u2013brain barrier like the circumventricular organs, place them as potential transducers of the gut\u2013brain immune\u2010inflammatory axis. TLR expression in other leaky structures such as choroid plexus and leptomeninges, in endothelial and perivascular cells of the BBB, has also been proposed as well as in neurons, astroglia and microglia 106. Work from G\u00e1rate et al. 107, in a murine model, using antibiotic intestinal decontamination, suggested a role for intestinal bacterial translocation in the upregulation of TLR4 expression in mice prefrontal cortex after stress exposure.",

HERVs belong to the superfamily of transposable elements, resulting from the integration of genetic elements from ancestral infectious retroviruses into human genomic DNA along evolution 109. Although epigenetic silencing mechanisms as well as the predominance of defective or inactive copies prevent the expression of HERVs, they may also be responsive to environmental stressors and thus be reactivated 108, 110. This has been shown for influenza and herpes simplex type 1 viruses, both acting as potent transactivators of HERV\u2010W element expression 111, 112. Reactivation of HERV\u2010W is not without consequences as production of Envelope (Env) protein, a TLR4 agonist, activates inflammation and neurotoxic effects through the activation of this pattern recognition receptor 111, 113. One study involving 45 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, 91 patients diagnosed with BD and 73 healthy controls found HERV\u2010W Env transcription to be increased in both psychiatric disorders, as compared with the control group, with higher values present in BD than in schizophrenia 114.",

However, characterization of genetic influences remains difficult as they may be dependent on epistatic and environmental interactions. Likewise, BD\u2010associated immune dysfunction most likely has multiple origins and may reflect aberrant immune activation triggered by gene\u2013environment interactions. Improvement in the quality of environmental measures is critical to move this area of research forward, as most studies rely on retrospective information with imprecise data on time of exposure. Collecting this information is essential because consequences of environmental insults, such as early\u2010life infections, acting on a background of immunogenetic vulnerability may (i) increase susceptibility to subsequent environmental exposures; (ii) increase vulnerability to the development of chronic immune dysfunction with consequent low\u2010grade inflammation, autoimmune and autoinflammatory phenomena, \u2018leaky gut\u2019/altered microbiota and reactivation of human endogenous retroviruses; (iii) increase the risk of other general medical comorbid conditions.
