While this first generation of GM plants has benefits for farmers, it is more difficult for the consumers to see any benefit other than, in limited cases, a possible decreased price owing to reduced cost of production. This may be one of the most important reasons why today's transgenic plants are under permanent fire of criticism. This situation may change in the near future when transgenic crops of the so-called second generation enter the market.A key to the success of such GM plants is metabolic engineering: the in vivo modification of cellular processes in specific plant cells resulting in the production of modified and/or increased amounts of non-protein products. The creation of these novel crops is a more ambitious and technically challenging task since it involves the modification of plant physiology and biochemistry rather than the overproduction of a single protein.",

Examples include enhancing the vitamin and mineral content of staple foods, eliminating common food allergens, developing higher protein quality and quantity in widely consumed crops.

The role of dietary fats in human nutrition has created widespread interest among consumers, clinicians and food producers. Concern with the type of fat, as an important dietary risk factor in coronary heart disease, has been a major impetus for the development of specialty modified fats and oils from plants. Consumers want oils that are low in saturated fats and low in trans-fatty acids. The food industry also requires that the oils have a high stability to oxidative changes as these can result in off-odours. The natural health products market for the omega-3 fatty acid and a-linolenic acid, found to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels and reducing the clotting of blood platelets and lowering blood pressure, is well established. Opportunities also exist to produce elevated levels of nutraceutical products such as vitamin E (the antioxidant a-tocopherol) in oils from plant sources. New findings in diet formulations and health-promoting substances will certainly drive further research and breeding of specialty crops that will be suited to fill such needs.

Amylose is the straight-chain form of this polymer, while amylopectin is the branched form. Starch is the main carbohydrate food reserve in plant seeds and tubers and while it forms an important part of human nutrition, it also provides a useful raw material for industry. Amylopectin has unique physicochemical properties that makes it attractive for a vast range of non-food purposes. Most industrial uses normally involve modification by physical, chemical or enzymatic methods to alter its properties for specific purposes. There is an advantage, however, in producing a wider range of natural starches or derivatives to circumvent the need for processing steps since this is expensive and some constitute an environmental load. Transgenic potatoes and maize producing amylose-free starch have indeed been developed and are ready to enter the market. Even the creation of transgenic plants with more complex genetic changes, which would result in the production of bio-degradable plastics (a third generation GM plant product) instead of starch, are well underway. Transgenic potatoes have also been modified to prevent starch degradation resulting in sugar formation during cold storage to prevent browning (due to the presence of reducing sugars) of french fries and chips. Other potatoes with a modified high-density starch absorb less oil when deep-fried, resulting in chips containing less fat. These and other lines of research have the potential of producing healthier foods or increasing the role of agriculture in replacing limited natural resources.Again, the design of such GM plants requires a detailed understanding of the chemistry of starch synthesis in plant cells and an extensive search for suitable traits that will not disturb the physiology of the host plant.",

One particular observation is worth noticing: in the Philippines a rice variety has been developed that does not die at the end of one season. Moreover, it can be grown in virtual hedgerows across mountain slopes. This perennial rice plant can be harvested again and again, while providing living barriers to soil movement on sloping land. This would help reduce loss of precious topsoil in upland regions, the silting of rivers and irrigation systems downstream, and the intensive inputs and hard labour of annual rice crops.While some of the plants have also survived experimental drought stress and yield more grain than expected, further breeding and multiplication may take five years or more before these plants are available to farmers.",

To be active, beta-carotene -(a pro-vitamin) must be split by an enzyme in the intestinal mucosa or liver into two molecules of vitamin A. Like vitamin A, the pro-vitamin is fat-soluble and requires dietary fat for absorption. Thus, digestion, absorption, and transport of beta-carotene require a functional digestive tract adequate energy, protein and fat in the diet. Therefore the RDA for carotene in healthy persons has been set to 2.4 mg. The current varieties of golden rice contain approximately 1.6 mg of beta-carotene/g dry weight. Using the standard beta-carotene-to-vitamin A conversion, 30 g of current golden rice would contain 8 mg of vitamin A activity, less than 1% of the RDA. Many children exhibiting symptoms of vitamin A deficiency suffer from generalised protein-energy malnutrition and intestinal infections that interfere with the absorption of betacarotene or its conversion to vitamin A. Therefore, at first glance, golden rice does not seem to contribute a great deal. On the other hand, RDA values are to some extent luxurious recommendations, representing a \"nice to have\"-supply, which also considers the multiple effects of vitamin A and especially of provitamin A, beta-carotene. The latter, besides being a provitamin, has one additional effect, which is to act as a free radical scavenger, thus preventing typical diseases in developed countries (diseases of the cardio-vascular system and some sorts of cancer). There is consent that the amounts required in the prevention of those severe symptoms of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries are significantly lower than given by RDA values. Furthermore, it is expected that future varieties of golden rice will contain increased levels of carotenes -carrots accumulate approximately 100 mg or more of beta-carotene/g fresh weight! We will therefore know a correct answer only after having data from the varieties bred by the plant breeders, from bioavailability studies and from nutritional studies on vitamin A-deficient people.",

Poor people do not eat plain rice out of choice, they just do not get enough to eat and are undernourished as well as malnourished. In numerous countries where vitamin A deficiency is endemic, food sources of beta-carotene are plentiful but are believed inappropriate for young children, are not cooked sufficiently to be digestible, or are not accompanied by enough dietary fat to permit absorption. In addition to doubts about cost and acceptability, biological, cultural, and dietary factors act as barriers to the use of beta-carotene, which explains why injections or supplements of pre-formed vitamin A are preferred as interventions. Opponents therefore reject the notion that golden rice could play a significant role to alleviate the VAD problems and dismiss the enthusiasm by others as a publicity campaign for the application of genetic modification.",

Continuous development in these areas of research has so far resulted in three \"generations\" of GM plants. The first GM plants contained genes responsible for agronomically important traits, such as herbicide tolerance or insect and disease resistance, which provide advantages for farmers by reducing the necessary input of herbicides, pesticides or manpower. The second generation of GM plants are those with improved end-use quality traits (see previous section). These plants are supposed to provide improved (food) products for consumers. The introduced genes change the composition of carbohydrates, fats or the functionality of proteins. Improved amino acid composition or vitamin content (for example golden rice, a GM rice with enhanced levels of pro-vitamin A) could enhance food quality (nutraceuticals). An increase in shelf life could lead to fresher products in supermarkets and to less spoilage during transport. Also, the taste of fruits and vegetables and the decrease of allergen content in food can be influenced by genetic modification. The third, and so far the most recent, generation of GM plants are those to be used as biofactories producing non-food fine chemicals or raw materials. Researchers may choose genetic modification of plants, but micro-organisms or animals can be attractive hosts as well. Substances to be used for diagnosing diseases or for therapy have already entered the market place. Researchers are also looking for new ways of immunising people and animals against viral and bacterial diseases. Apart from medical applications, GM plants with altered patterns of fatty acid contents find uses in the production of technical oils. GM plants may also be used to produce biopolymers replacing petroleum-based compounds in the plastics industry.",

Soil acidity is a major problem for about 30% of all arable land in tropical regions. The presence of aluminium at levels exceeding 200 ppm presents a serious abiotic stress for most crops. The most important symptom of aluminium toxicity is the inhibition of root growth, caused by inhibitory effects on calcium and magnesium import at the level of the cellular membrane. Long-term exposure of plants to aluminium also inhibits shoot growth by inducing nutrient deficiencies, drought stress and phytohormone imbalances. Metal toxicity and nutrient deficiency problems in acid soils are investigated by only a handful of scientists in developed countries and this topic has thus far been largely neglected by large agrochemical companies. Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the oldest and most depleted soils in the world. Thousands of years of weathering have leached the nutrients, leaving the soil highly acidic, causing aluminium and manganese to become soluble and thereby toxic to plants.

Paul Ehrlich, author of the book The Population Bomb, developed an equation in the 1970s to describe the impact of human population on the environment. The population-resource equation puts the challenge that faces agriculture into perspective by saying: (Natural resource use)\u00a5(technology)=(population)\u00a5(per capita consumption). It would mean that, unless plant science and agricultural technologies can bring significant progress, natural resources will be increasingly employed to feed a growing world population with rising demands.",

Pesticide or fertiliser runoff and soil erosion threaten aquatic and avian species from sweet and coastal waters. But, paradoxically, if agricultural technology had been frozen at 1961 levels, the level of agricultural production in 1998 would have required more than a doubling of land devoted to agriculture: an extra area approximately the size of South America. Since the best agricultural land is probably already being cultivated and new cropland is unlikely to be as productive, this may even be a conservative estimate. Thanks to improvements in productivity this could still be avoided, but, as the human population rises from 6 to 9 billion people in the next 50 years, the environment may be further stressed by necessary increases in agricultural farmlands. There are still areas, mainly in Africa, where the techniques of the Green Revolution have yet to be tried, but in most of the developing world the gains in productivity are tailing off. Perhaps again we need a new impulse from science in developing sustainable agricultural systems that will curb the trend.",

So far conventional plant breeding still leads in contributing to yield increases. Farmers were modifying plant genomes long before they knew anything about genes. For thousands of years, they sought to transfer desirable traits from one plant species to another by cross-breeding. This was how wheat was obtained from wild grasses. Modern plant breeders further developed these crops with additional desirable traits, such as disease resistance. When crossing two plants, hybrids are formed and their genetic materials will be fully mixed. After subsequent rounds of self-crossing of the progeny and selection of promising candidates, a new and stable variety may be obtained with a set of desired characteristics. It typically takes 8-12 years to produce an improved plant variety by way of conventional cross-breeding. Now, using techniques of molecular biology, scientists can identify traits from similar species or even from unrelated organisms and, basically in a single step, transfer those desirable genes into agronomically important crops. Therefore, as an extension of traditional plant breeding, plant biotechnology or genetic modification uses genetic knowledge and scientific techniques to add specific traits to crops, such as an ability to fend off pests, survive droughts, delay ripening, or require less pesticides. Such traits specifically benefit farmers, including those in developing countries where crop losses due to weeds, pests and diseases are high and conventional tools to ward off those problems are unavailable or unaffordable. Other traits, such as disease resistances or less dependence on fertilisers also have benefits for the environment, while crops with enhanced levels of healthpromoting substances or improved taste benefit the consumer.",

It is this labelling standard that motivated the African countries to refuse the US food aid that contained GM maize. There was concern that farmers would plant the maize instead of using it as food, resulting in cross-pollination of native maize seeds. If that should happen the European standards would no longer be met and the countries would no longer be able to export surplus maize in the future.

Similar restrictions apply more or less for protection through the plant variety protection laws (PVP, or plant breeders' rights), which are generally based on the UPOV Convention. To be granted protection, a variety must fulfil criteria governing novelty, distinctiveness, uniformity and stability while allowing farmers to save seeds for their own use.

The broad spectrum of traits that is addressed by Chinese researchers include yield increases, disease resistances, abiotic stress responses, enhancement of the nutritional value of crops and reduction of the use of inputs that are causing environmental and health concerns.
