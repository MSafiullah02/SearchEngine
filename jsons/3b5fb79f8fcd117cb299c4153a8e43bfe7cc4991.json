However, we do not know whether infected children play a substantial role as drivers of the epidemic.

To address these issues, we developed a protocol addressing reception, risk-management and hospitalization of suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases at the pediatric emergency department and medical-surgical units aimed at containing intra-hospital transmission of the infection, considering that currently our hospital is the largest referral site in the primary outbreak area in Italy. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids on nasal-/oropharyngeal swab (NO/OP swab).",

Eight out of 33 (24%) pediatricians and 14/45 (31%) nurses were infected in 22 days, 6 exhibiting radiographically confirmed pneumonia (requiring hospitalization in two), the others having mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and/or fever requiring home isolation. However only 4 cases occurred after (\u2265 48 hours) the adoption of the spatial reorganization of the Emergency Department and of the ward, and the adoption of the final COVID-19 protocol (Figure 2).DISCUSSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak represents a hazard of unknown proportion to national healthcare systems. It is now clear, that, in the absence of population-wide mitigation policies aimed at containment, the number of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with suspected COVID-19 is large. This sudden and overwhelming burden of patients has rapidly saturated the general and intensive care bed capacity, and shifted the human and medical resources to the care of patients who occupy most of the beds in all health care facilities. Infection of a large proportion of HCP has been recorded, and the role of healthcare facilities as sources of spread of the epidemic has emerged. The high rate of infections among HCP in Wuhan, China, and in our experience in Bergamo suggests that hospitals may play a substantial role in SARS-CoV-2 dispersion to the community. For their own health and for protection of others, HCP PPE should be a priority.Although children are relatively spared as far as morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, they also can spread the infection. The mission of a pediatric department is to cocoon hospitalized patients carrying the virus. As the tertiary pediatric care facility in the \"eye of the cyclone\" -pediatric oncology hub and pediatric liver transplant center -we aimed to create safe reception routes to the Emergency Department by the identification of patients at-risk of COVID-19 at the point of entry, to detect infections among children admitted to the hospital units, and to protect HCP. Because children infected with COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms (5,6), we chose to obtain a NP/OP swab from all children requiring hospitalization, regardless of presenting symptoms, in order to separate the cohorts of patients effectively.",
