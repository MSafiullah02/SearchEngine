This allows the operator to rebreathe his expired (but hopefully uncontaminated) air for a limited time during the procedure. Although this might offer better protection from infection than current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for homemade cloth masks in situations of last resort, it also introduces risks of hypoxia and hypercarbia due to rebreathing (1,2).",

Heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored. The gas composition in the bag (fraction of inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressure) was continuously sampled with the gas analyzer module of an anesthesia machine (M-CAIOV, Datex Ohmeda, General Electric Company, Boston, MA) via a sampling line inserted into the bag. Each run was aborted when symptoms experienced were felt to be significant enough to impair the capacity to safely carry out a medical procedure, such as endotracheal intubation. At termination, time elapsed and subject\u2019s end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure were recorded. The experiments were then repeated, with the same bags prefilled with oxygen prior to use (results in Table 1\n).",

This accounted for the breathlessness (the primary symptom that resulted in termination of the experiments), anxiety, and distress that both authors reported nearing the end of each run. Overall, the mean duration tolerated was short, although longer when bags were prefilled with oxygen (5 min vs 7.5 min). Only the environment in bags prefilled with air became hypoxic, although no oxygen desaturation below 94% occurred. These findings are consistent with our understanding of physiology, with hypercarbia being the major contributor of dyspnea and limiting factor for tolerance in this situation, secondarily compounded by hypoxia (4).",

They also may risk hypoxia (especially if the bag is not prefilled with oxygen) and serious carbon dioxide toxicity in situations where the option to abort an unexpectedly prolonged procedure may not be possible without resulting in significant patient harm (5). In addition, our findings suggest that prefilling the bags with oxygen may obviate the need for continuous oxygen insufflation via additional tubing during use because hypercarbia will limit use in this context long before hypoxia develops. This will have the advantage of simplifying the setup and reducing the risk that an already-vulnerable seal quality may be further compromised by the need to allow for additional inflow tubing.",

Where possible, we also suggest having a second operator available to spot and keep time for the first, and to don and take over as a contingency during longer procedures. Capnography monitoring, if available, may be considered, although use must again be weighed against the disadvantages of increasing unwieldiness and complexity of the setup.",
