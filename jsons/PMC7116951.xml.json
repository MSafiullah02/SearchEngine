Moreover, BCoV is shed both through respiratory and enteric secretions in high amounts (1 billion virus particles per ml of feces) for up to 14 days23. Consequently, BCoV infection is transmitted by fecal-oral or respiratory route and generally occurs by horizontal transmission from the mother to the offspring or between calves14, 18.",

Serial 4-fold dilutions of the serum samples were tested in duplicate followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated commercial Ab to bovine IgG1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., USA). The reaction was developed using hydrogen peroxide and ABTS as substrate/chromogen system (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and read at a wavelength of 405 nm (Multiskan Ex, Labsystems Inc.). The titer of each sample was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with a corrected optical density (OD405C; OD405 values in the BCoV-coated wells minus OD405 values in the HRT-18-coated wells) greater than the cut-off value of the assay. The cut-off value was established as the average of OD405C values of four blank wells (PBS-0.05% Tween 20) plus three standard deviations (SD).",

The IgG1 Abs to BCoV significantly differed between groups depending on the time (GLMM Group-Time F(5,120)\n = 12.17, p\n < 0.0001). The FPT group had significantly lower IgG1 Ab titers to BCoV than the APT calves for up to seven days after the beginning of the experiment.

As expected, the higher the initial level of IgG1 Abs in the calves\u2019 sera, the longest it took for them to decrease to a susceptible level. When BCoV IgG1 Ab titers decreased to 16 or 64, BCoV infection was evidenced by either virus detection in feces, or by a minimum 16-fold increase of anti-BCoV IgG1 ELISA Ab titers for around two weeks (defined as seroconversion for the purpose of this study) (Table 1, Fig. 2\n). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed BCoV IgG1 seroconversion between 14 and 21 days of the experiment while only 29.4% (5/17) of the animals from the APT group presented sequential seroconversion during the same period (Fisher's exact test, p\n = 0.085) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

In Argentina, we previously reported a significantly higher rate of BCoV diarrhea in dairy herds compared to beef herds6. We detected viral shedding in a small number of animals but high viral circulation manifested through BCoV seroconversion. Low viral detection could be due to a lower sensitivity of ELISA compared with the RT-PCR assay to detect BCoV in feces7. However, another country from the southern hemisphere shows a low detection rate using RT-PCR1. BCoV shedding was detected at high titers during only two or three days differing with other experiments in which BCoV shedding was long lasting23, 32. This supports the idea of a lower sensitivity of the ELISA assay for BCoV detection used. Moreover, we showed that calves with high BCoV IgG1 Ab titers were often protected against infection, while animals with low BCoV IgG1 Ab titers showed significantly higher BCoV infection rates (p\n < 0.0001). On the one hand, BCoV infection dynamics was drastically affected by these Ab titers since 71% of FPT animals showed BCoV IgG1 seroconversion during the experiment. The significant difference in Ab titers at the beginning of the study was also associated with a significant difference in total protein levels. Furthermore, when IgG1 titers decreased over time and reached non-protective levels (BCoV IgG1 Ab titers of 16 or 64), calves seroconverted confirming BCoV infection, even when the antigen was not detected in the feces by the methodology used. On the other hand, 70.6% of animals from the APT group maintained elevated IgG1 Ab titers over time and only five calves eventually seroconverted. Moreover, calves with maternal BCoV IgG1 Ab titers of 4096 or higher seemed to be protected against BCoV infection over the course of this study, suggesting that specific IgG1 Abs from colostrum are critical for the prevention of BCoV infection20. Although there was a tendency to observe more BCoV IgG1 seroconversion in calves from the FPT group compared with calves from the APT group, this difference was not significant (Fisher's Exact Test, p\n = 0.085). This could be due to a low number of experimental units in the FPT group.",

However, vaccination success can be affected by several factors including deficiencies in herd management and varying vaccine quality29. As was mentioned previously, we have no information either about the vaccination of dams against neonatal diarrhea or about the quality of commercial CoVB vaccines. Therefore, Abs transferred to calves through colostrum intake might be due to previous exposure to BCoV or to an active immunization of the dam with this agent. The lack of a good passive immune transference in addition to a diet based on milk replacer might only have contributed to the occurrence of diarrhea in 100% of the studied animals. All calves suffered a severe and long lasting diarrhea (17 to 19 days). The etiology of diarrhea could be diverse since other infection agents were not discarded, and neither antibiotic nor anti-parasitic drugs were used as preventive strategies. BCoV infection was evidenced by antigen shedding or seroconversion in 42% of the calves, while RVA infection was evidenced by shedding in 50% of calves. Thus, RVA is a major agent associated with NCD, as has been reported elsewhere1, 2, 13.",
