Therefore, the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides incorporated into the diet, at a dose of 5-40 g/kg, induces a beneficial population of microorganisms in different intestinal segments, maintaining the health of the animals (Mikkelsen, Jakobsen, & Jensen, 2003) . However, the post-weaning use of prebiotics and probiotics is very questionable; several authors (Fedalto, Tkacz, & Ader, 2002; Mikkelsen et al., 2003; Sanches et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2003) reported a lack of improvement in weight gain and feed conversion from 22 to 54 days of age. In theory, prebiotics can improve the digested volume as a result of the increase in microbial biomass, and consequently, the action of a probiotic is suitable (Lan, Tran, & Kim, 2017; Utiyama et al., 2006) . In our study, the ADG response was greatest in T4 (combined use of prebiotic and probiotics), and the FCR improved throughout all the fattening periods. Another study reported an increase in weight gain with a combination of probiotics (Taras, Vahjen, & Simon, 2007) , and the use of anaerobic fermentable products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been reported to improve weight gain in weaned piglets due to the increase in beneficial microorganisms in the intestine (Price et al., 2014) . Therefore, the inconsistencies among the above-mentioned authors can be explained by the type of prebiotic and probiotics used for each experiment. The inclusion levels of efficient prebiotics in feed improve the concentration of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the intestine, although high concentrations might affect the digestibility of nutrients (Cross, 2002) . Prebiotics improve energy efficiency, allowing the animal to generate muscle mass and a desired body weight for the market (Branner & Roth-Maier, 2006 ).

The intestinal villous atrophy in T1 was mild in the ileum compared with the other treatments.Hornich, Salajka, Sarmanova, Ulmann, and Sedlacek (1975) observed the importance of atrophy of the intestinal villi in pig ilea in diets that did not include any additive or growth promoter. They concluded that atrophy not only affects the normal mechanisms of absorption but also allows development of pathogenic microorganisms such as Rotavirus and Coronavirus, which are important agents responsible for lesions of the intestinal epithelium. On the other hand, in other studies, reporting that enterotoxigenic E. coli strains do not cause significant villi atrophy, and when atrophy is produced in newborn piglets, it is associated with enteroinvasive E. coli. (Barker & Van Dreumel, 1991; Castillo, Mart \u0131n-Or ue, Nofrar \u0131as, Manzanilla, & Gasa, 2007). Microscopically, the ileum of T1 pigs was the most affected segment, showing congestion, bacterial adherence, epithelial vacuolization of intestinal villi, atrophy, eosinophilic infiltration, mononuclear infiltration (greater inflammation) and lymphoid necrosis in Peyer's patches, with the T1 pigs showing the most severe lesions compared to the other treatments. Lemos et al. (2005) studied the effect of probiotics and prebiotics added to the diet of pigs on the structure of small intestine villi and found atrophy when these additives were not included. On the other hand, the concentration of cytokines was essential and corroborated the presence of an inflammatory reaction in the ileum. TNF-a and IL-6 are proinflammatory cytokines that play a critical role in normal host resistance to infection, serving as immmunomodulators of inflammatory responses (Nyachoti et al., 2012). Both are primarily created by activated macrophages through many signals, such as ionophores, lipopolysaccharide, and antigenic stimulation by pathogenic microorganisms (MohanKumar et al., 2017).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "nization by pathogenic bacteria (Solis, de los Reyes-Gavilan, Fern andez, Margolles, & Gueimonde, 2010).
