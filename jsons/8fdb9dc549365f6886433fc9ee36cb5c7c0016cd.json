Type I Alveolar Cells or Pneumocytes are thin and flat and form the structure of alveoli. Type I cells take a major role in the gas exchange process between the alveoli and blood circulation. They are unable to replicate and sensitive to toxins. Type II alveolar cells are few in number (< 5%), and they are mostly found at the blood-air barrier and secrete surfactants. Type II cells play a major role to protect the lung in case of damage. They undergo cellular division, giving rise to more type I and II alveolar cells, without which the alveoli would collapse. Alveolar macrophages or the dust cells are very important in providing the lungs protection against microorganisms. They not only engulf the microorganisms, but they also scavenge any foreign molecules like dust, carbon particles, and molecules developed from blood cell injuries. There are three types of macrophages found in lungs. Alveolar macrophages or AM\u03a6s are found within the airways and guard the alveolar cells in bronchi, alveoli. The interstitial macrophages (IM\u03a6s) are found in lung interstitium, while the exudate-derived macrophages, EM\u03a6s, are recruited in response to an inflammation. These three populations are distinguishable from each other morphologically and functionally (https://epi.publichealth. nc.gov/cd/diseases/respiratory.html).",

            "text": "The major phagocytic cells of our immune system are neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Silva Manuel and Correia 2012) ( Fig. 7 .1). The phagocytic cells exhibit their microbicidal properties by generating huge amount of ROS and RNS within the phagosomes (Fang 2011 ). This metabolic process or respiratory burst is most prominent in neutrophils as compared to other phagocytic cells and causes oxidative stress. Respiratory burst initiates with the assembly of the components of an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase (Groemping and Rittinger 2005) present on the plasma membrane and on the membranes of phagosomes in an inactive form. Upon phagocytosis of any molecule, assembly of the components leads to the formation of an active enzyme complex. This complex transfers one electron to O 2 from NADPH and forms superoxide radical (O 2 .\u2212 ) within the phagosomal lumen (Peterhans 1997) . The superoxides can undergo spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed dismutation to yield H 2 O 2 and O 2 . H 2 O 2 combines with halides in presence of the enzyme myeloperoxidase and produces reactive hypohalous acid. These superoxide radicals may also interact with NO to produce peroxynitrite, ONOO-. These ROS/ RNS can damage a variety of biomolecules and kill the ingested microorganism (Halliwell and Aruoma 1991) . They form adducts with unsaturated bonds and clusters having less electrons. Thus they can damage enzymes and unsaturated fatty acids or can oxidize 4Fe-4S clusters present in enzymes or proteins resulting in metabolic defects. Damaged Fe-S clusters can release Fe, which will react with H 2 O 2 (Fenton reaction) and yield . OH leading to more damage. The cysteine residues present in proteins and enzymes can also interact with H 2 O 2 directly. Superoxides do not damage membranes in bacteria, as they lack polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Fig. 7 .2). Acidification of phagosomes is required for the optimal function of hydrolytic enzymes and thus for the degradation of the internalized pathogen. The acidification process is achieved by the recruitment of vacuolar proton-ATPase to the phagosomal membrane at the early phase of phagosome maturation. Recently it has been shown that TRPM2, the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential cation channel, expressed on the membrane of phagosome regulates the acidification and is essential for the efflux of Ca 2+ during phagosome maturation (Di et al. 2017) . The antimicrobial capacity of neutrophils is higher than that of macrophages as their cytoplasm contains granules full of multiple antimicrobial molecules and peptides like defensins, cathelicidins, and proteins like lactoferrin and bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein (Gudmundsson and Agerberth 1999) .",

In Mtb-infected macrophages, Mtb glycolipids can block PI3P synthesis and thus interfere with phagosome-lysosome fusion and escape lysosome-mediated killing (Vergne et al. 2005 ). \u2022 Another strategy is to prevent accumulation of PI3P on the membrane of phagosomes by degrading it by an acid phosphatase called SapM, a 28KDa protein, secreted by Mtb within the host cell cytosol (Saleh and Belisle 2000) . \u2022 Two protein phosphatases of Mtb, PtpA and B, interfere with host protein trafficking processes and increase the chance of survival for Mtb (Bach et al. 2008 ). \u2022 PknG, another protein kinase of Mtb, prevents the degradation of Mtb in lysosomes (Scherr et al. 2007 ). \u2022 The Mtb internalized phagosome is prevented from fusing with lysosomes by host protein coronin1/TACO and calcineurin and thereby helps in the survival of Mtb ). \u2022 The proteasomes of Mtb neutralize the effect of NO and thus escape RNSmediated killing. In addition, the induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin (LL-37) is done through TLR signaling, and the process is vitamin D dependent (Fabri et al. 2011 ). \u2022 Mtb produces several proteins/enzymes that are responsible for removal or detoxification of ROS and RNS. One such protein, KatG, a catalase peroxidase, destroys hydrogen peroxide. An extracellular Mn-Fe SOD (SodA) converts superoxide radical to O 2 and H 2 O 2 . Another Cu-Zn SOD (SodC) remains bound to the outer membrane of Mtb and possibly protects the surface against extracellular superoxides generated by host cells (Piddington et al. 2001 ). \u2022 A genome-wide interaction study performed by Nambi et al. predicted the functional relationships among three proteins, the superoxide-detoxifying enzyme (SodA), an integral membrane protein (DoxX), and possibly a thiol oxidoreductase (SseA). This oxidoreductase complex helps Mtb to survive inside the host (Nambi et al. 2015) .",

This results in the damage of cell membrane resulting in fibrosis and dysfunction of lungs in pulmonary TB. Vijayamalini M et al. reported significant increase in lipid peroxidation marker, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), in pulmonary tuberculosis patients, both newly diagnosed and untreated, as compared to controls. The levels of antioxidants in plasma were found to decrease leading to the pathogenesis and severity of the disease (Vijayamalini and Manoharan 2004) . Generation of ROS increases in TB patients coinfected with HIV. Rajopadhye et al. reported decreased NO levels in serum of TB patients, while no change was observed in patients having both HIV and TB (Rajopadhye et al. 2017 ). There were increased levels of TBARS and CRP in both groups though increase in superoxide anion was found in HIV-TB group. Increased ROS production by the tat protein of HIV might activate NF-\u03baB (Fiume et al. 2012 ) and lead to the increased rate of transcription in HIV. The activities of catalase and SOD were found to decrease in TB group. Increased SOD activity and total serum protein concentration were found in both groups compared to control. Power et al. reported in their study that antioxidant supplementation along with antituberculosis treatment (ATT) for 6 months significantly decreased the MDA level and increased the levels of vitamin C and E and total antioxidant status. Hence, their study concludes that supplementation of micronutrients or antioxidants promotes recovery of patients from tuberculosis by reducing OS (Pawar et al. 2011) . Another work conducted by Janiszewska and group also reported that MDA concentration in the plasma of pulmonary tuberculosis patients was significantly higher before and after 1 and 2 months of antioxidant treatment with ATT compared to the control group which received only ATT (Janiszewska-Drobinska et al. 2001 ). Wagh et al. found in their study that the levels of prooxidants were significantly increased, whereas antioxidant markers were significantly decreased in the TB population compared to healthy controls (Wagh et al. 2016) . In another experiment, the authors measured the OS markers and antioxidant capacity in granulomatous lesions in BCG-vaccinated and non-vaccinated guinea pigs infected with Mtb (Palanisamy et al. 2011) . They observed decreased serum total antioxidant capacity and increased MDA concentration within lesions in nonvaccinated guinea pigs within 2 weeks of infection which were partially restored by the treatment of N-acetyl cysteine. In addition, the antioxidant also decreased Mtb counts in the spleen and severity of lesion necrosis in the lung and spleen. Hence, proper antioxidants might be used as an adjunct therapy along with conventional ATT for better treatment and prevention of tuberculosis.",

Influenza virus can infect epithelial cells present both in upper and lower respiratory tract depending on the nature of the HA present on the capsid. In vivo studies showed that different IAV subtypes infect and replicate differently in the lung and thus result in different outcome (Taubenberger and Morens 2008) . In most cases of mild and avirulent viruses, the HA is cleaved from the viral envelope by proteases in the upper respiratory tract, and these viruses mainly infect the nose, throat, and mouth. Hence, these strains are easily transmitted among people through sneezing and coughing. The HA of strains like H5N1 can be cleaved by a variety of proteases, allowing the virus to spread throughout the body. These strains cause severe flu but are not easily spread among people. The infected cells secrete huge amount of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that lead to inflammation. It is believed that the virus inhibits adrenocorticotropic hormone resulting in lowered cortisol levels (Taubenberger and Morens 2008) . Coinfection of a susceptible cell by two IAVs at the same time can lead to antigenic shift where viral RNAs are mixed and a new shift virus strain can be generated.",

It has also been found that infection with IAV strains that replicate productively in M\u03a6s can induce many changes in M2 M\u03a6s, causing them to phenotypically resemble proinflammatory M1 M\u03a6s. Expression rate of the antibody Fc receptors (CD16 and CD32) present on M\u03a6s surface and responsible for opsonization has been found to decrease in IAV-infected cells (Cline et al. 2017 ). Depletion of AM\u03a6s in mice and pigs using clodronate (released inside the M\u03a6s after phagocytosis and kills the cells)-loaded liposomes resulted in higher viral loads proving major role for M\u03a6s in controlling disease severity (Duan et al. 2017) .

Neutrophil depletion leads to increased number of virus particles and increased morbidity and mortality compared to control mice (Tate Michelle et al. 2008 ). Tumpey et al. established the role of macrophages and neutrophils in early-phase protection against an infection with a recombinant human influenza virus (H1N1) (Tumpey 2005) . It can be inferred that neutrophils contributed to early protection against low inoculum of the virus but not against the high inoculums indicating a limitation of PMN function. Haruo Fujisawa showed that neutrophils provide protection against influenza viruses in tumor-bearing mice with neutrophilic leukocytosis (Fujisawa 2008) . In vitro multiplication of influenza virus was also prevented by neutrophils from both normal and tumor-bearing mice. Addition of N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), a chemotactic factor and macrophage activator, to the culture, increased the inhibitory effect of neutrophils. Virus infectivity was found to decrease in the initial phase after infection in ICR and BALB/c mice though no such decrease was observed in tumor-bearing C57BU6 mice. Administration of fMLP inhibited the virus propagation in the lungs of normal and tumor-bearing mice having intranasal IAV infection. Hence, neutrophils play a significant role against IAV infection in vivo.",

Infection with seasonal IAV also results in production of cytokines and chemokines from macrophages. The number of M\u03a6s increases in the lung in case of an IAV infection and returns to regular numbers following the resolution of the infection. Yu-Hsiang Lee et al. compared the immune responses induced by two strains of influenza virus, A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Panama-like (H3N2) in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast to A/Panama-like (H3N2), WSN virus induced severe lung pathology accompanied by massive Gr-1 + and CD11b + cell infiltration and high levels of CXCL6/GCP-2, CCL2/MCP-1, and TIMP-1 production. Both the Gr-1 + and CD11b + cells produced ROS and RNS in lungs (Lee and Huang 2017) . The level of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme synthesizing O 2\u2212 , was found to increase in lung homogenates, and cells lavaged out of the lung showed a marked increase in O 2\u2212 production when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). In another model, Oda et al. showed that intravenously injected pyran copolymer-conjugated superoxide dismutase protected mice from the lethal effect of IAV (Oda et al. 1989 ). In addition to ROS, NO seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of IAV (Akaike et al. 2003) .",

The reason lies on the effect of ROS on protease inhibitors present in the lung surfactant. The HA protein must be cleaved intracellularly into the dipeptides HA1 and HA2 for the propagation of the disease. Influenza virus strains that possess a HA that fits optimally with the intracellular protease is released into the extracellular space in the HA1/HA2 form, which is infectious. The HA that fits less optimally with the protease is released mostly in the noninfectious HA0 form (Kido et al. 1993) . Cleavage of HA0 can still take place by the extracellular proteases present in pulmonary surfactant. As a protective mechanism, surface of alveoli carries antiproteases. These antiproteases can be inactivated by ROS. Hence, ROS generation can result into manyfold increase in infectious virus particles. A group of workers reported that intracellular ROS levels decrease in phagocytes after influenza infection. This decrease in ROS leads to increased susceptibility to secondary infections by bacteria like S. aureus (Sun et al. 2016a ).",

The authors suggested that the sources of H 2 O 2 were activated leucocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, and development of OS leads to the activation of neutrophils and other effector cells with generation of excess active oxygen forms in the lungs of CAP patients (Majewska et al. 2004 ). These ROS migrate through the alveolar-capillary membrane in the process of gas exchange and are able to induce the OS development in the erythrocytes (Ugurlu 2016 ). Trefler in their work showed increased levels of TBARS in CAP caused by bacteria compared to control. However, they observed lower TBARS levels and increased glutathione redox system in viral CAP caused by H1N1 compared to normal (Trefler et al. 2014) . In another study, Vilen et al.",

It has been found that postinfluenza Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia leads to extensive lung inflammation even after antibiotic treatment. The chronic granulomatous diseases in humans are linked to X chromosome-linked Nox2 expression (Sun et al. 2016b ). Yuanyuan Chen et al. demonstrated increase in OS and cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the lung and peripheral blood with increase in the severity of CAP. Vitamin C supplementation inhibited ROS, DNA damage, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in LPSstimulated macrophages. It also inhibited autophagy in MH-S cells exposed to LPS and H 2 O 2 (Chen et al. 2014) . Rodrigo et al. observed lower FRAP and the GSH/ GSSG ratio and increased lipid peroxidation in both plasma and erythrocytes in CAP than control values. Thus the antioxidant status alterations are correlated with clinical severity (Castillo et al. 2013 ). Many studies have showed that administration of antioxidants such as Vitamins E and C have positive effects on oxidative biomarkers in in vivo and in vitro models of CAP (Siempos et al. 2008 ). There are controversies regarding the use of vitamins in CAP though (Merchant et al. 2004 ).",
