The association of RSV-ADV coinfection with severe disease was, however, not evident when we assessed prolonged hospitalization. Our data are supported by findings of another study in which RSV-ADV coinfection showed statistically significant increases in hospital length of stay, days with supplemental oxygen use, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation compared with RSV monoinfection in children hospitalized for LRTI, although no comparison was made with ADV monoinfection [33] . In a study of mixed RSV-ADV infection, RSV-ADV coinfection was not found to be more severe than ADV alone when examining duration of fever, oxygen requirement, and length of hospital stay [34] . Another study of 9 RSV-confirmed infants found that 75% of children with RSV-ADV coinfection died despite mechanical ventilation [35] . Even though ADV alone may be responsible for more severe disease, clinical features such as hospital stay were not found to differ between RSV and ADV hospitalized LRTI [36] . However, increased pathogenicity may be explained by distinctly different immunological responses produced by RSV and ADV.
