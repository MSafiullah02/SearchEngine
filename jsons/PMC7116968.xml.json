The use of ginseng in traditional Chinese medicine dates back to about 5000 years ago, by the legendary Emperor Shennong who, as reported in literature, was the first to classify hundreds of medicinal and poisonous herbs, giving rise to the bedrock of the oldest Pharmacopoeia in the world (Yun, 2001). The term ginseng, from the Chinese jen-shen, means \u201cplant-man\u201d, possibly due to the anthropomorphic shape of its root (Yun, 2001). It is also believed that, according to Oriental medicine, ginseng roots contain the three main human essences, i.e. the body, mind and spirit and, therefore, it is considered \u201cThe Lord of herbs\u201d (Yun, 2001).",

Thirteen species of ginseng have been identified, but the most common used are the Panax ginseng (or Korean ginseng) grown in China and Korea and Panax quinquefolius (or American ginseng) grown in the United States (Virginia and Wisconsin) and Canada (Ontario, Quebec) (Baeg and So, 2013). Indeed, the world's largest producer of ginseng is China (44.749 tons), followed by South Korea (27.480 tons), Canada (6486 tons) and the United States (1054 tons) (Baeg and So, 2013). Data collected in 2009 confirm that Hong Kong is the biggest importer of ginseng root, whereas Canada is the biggest exporter in the world (Baeg and So, 2013). As far as the market distribution is concerned, South Korea is the largest in the world; however, in this Country the domestic consumption of ginseng is larger than the amount exported (Baeg and So, 2013). Ginseng is also used as an ingredient to season foods, such as chewing gums, candies and beverages. Remarkably successful is ginseng coffee which can be drunk in many coffee bars, but also prepared at home.",

            "text": "The bioactive compounds in ginseng are about thirty triterpene glycosides, called ginsenosides. From a chemical viewpoint, these glycosides are divided into either the 20(S)-protopanaxadiol group (PPD), which includes ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg3, Rc and Rd or 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT), which comprises ginsenosides Re, Rg1, Rg2 and Rh1, depending on their aglycone moieties (Kim et al., 2013a) (Table 1\n). In fresh ginseng, ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Re and Rg1 are the main ones (70\u201380% of total ginsenosides) (Koh et al., 2015). P. ginseng roots often undergo specific processes to promote their preservation and effectiveness, including steaming (red ginseng), air-drying and fermentation (fermented red ginseng) (Koh et al., 2015). Both steaming and air-drying reduce the amount of ginsenosides compared to those contained in the fresh root by approximately 50%; nevertheless, the total amount of remaining ginsenosides, after steaming and air-drying, varies between 14 \u00b1 0.04 mg/g and 18 \u00b1 4.5 mg/g (Koh et al., 2015). These conservation procedures also alter the quality of ginsenosides, e.g. steaming results in the formation of novel compounds, such as, Rh4 and Rf2, whereas steaming and air-drying significantly increase the amount of Rb1 with respect to fresh ginseng, suggesting that other ginsenosides are transformed into Rb1 during the process (Koh et al., 2015).",

Blood absorption of compound K starts 4 h after the administration of P. ginseng powder and reaches the maximum 9\u201314 h after the administration (Lee et al., 2009). Interesting data by Wang et al. (2011) on P. quinquefolius (10 g per os with a cup of water), showed that ginsenoside Rb1 peak plasma concentration (Cmax) occurred 4 h after the administration, whereas, at this time point, compound K was not detected, in agreement with Lee et al. (2009). Table 2\nreports the main pharmacokinetic parameters for both Rb1 and compound K in subjects receiving supplements of several P. ginseng or P. quinquefolius preparations. It is also worth underlining how the previously described methods affect the pharmacokinetics of compound K (Table 2). Steaming reduces, Cmax, Tmax (the time to reach Cmax) and AUC0\u201324h (an index of bioavailability) for P. ginseng-derived compound K, whereas fermentation reduces Tmax and increases both Cmax and AUC0\u201324h (Table 2). The latter data support the fact that fermented red ginseng produces active compound K faster and in a greater amount.",

(2017) reported the influence of Asian or Western diets on compound K and ginsenoside Rb1 formation and absorption in six healthy male volunteers, supplemented with P. quinquefolius powder (2 g/day per os for 7 days). Individuals eating a Western diet showed a marked decrease in ginsenoside Rb1 plasma levels vis-\u00e0-vis with a significant increase in compound K plasma levels compared to those eating an Asian diet (Wan et al., 2017). On the other hand, ginsenoside Rb1 and compound K fecal levels resulted much higher in individuals consuming a Western diet than an Asian diet. These findings suggest both an increased conversion of ginsenoside Rb1 into compound K in Western-diet subjects with a longer duration of ginseng-microbiota interaction in the colon without compound absorption (Wan et al., 2017). As the Asian diet is based on various vegetables and rice, whereas the Western diet is rich in fats and animal proteins, it is likely that these differences are responsible for the alteration of enteric microbiota population affecting ginseng metabolism and absorption (Genton et al., 2015, Janssen and Kersten, 2015, Moco et al., 2012, Simpson and Campbell, 2015, Wan et al., 2017). Indeed, Wu et al.

Korean red ginseng (20\u201360 mg/kg/day per os for 3 days) inhibited anxiety-like behavior in rats undergoing ethanol-withdrawal by increasing dopamine (DA) brain levels (Zhao et al., 2014). In mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress, the administration of an aqueous extract of P. quinquefolius (100\u2013200 mg/kg per os prior to the stress) reverted both corticosterone plasma levels and the stress-induced depletion of noradrenaline (NA), DA and serotonin (5-HT) in the hippocampus and cortex by restoring the regulation of the stress axis and decreasing interleukin production (Rasheed et al., 2008) (Fig. 1).",

Such events occurred through the up-regulation of pro-survival pathways, such as Akt and eNOS, together with the down-regulation of members of the apoptotic cascade, including caspase-3/7 (Luo et al., 2015). Red ginseng extract (250\u2013500 mg/kg/day per os for 7\u20139 days) improved ventricular hemodynamic function parameters, reduced ST segment and QRS complex intervals and increased antioxidant myocardial levels in both pigs and rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury (Lim et al., 2013a, Lim et al., 2014). Similarly, Korean red ginseng (250\u2013500 mg/kg/day per os for 14 days) suppressed both lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB fraction and cardiac troponin I and reduced oxidative stress-induced damage in guinea pigs with I/R injury; as a consequence, aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output and left ventricular systolic pressure increased (Lim et al., 2013b). A P. quinquefolius extract (50 mg/kg/day per os for 7 days) decreased infarct size and myocardial apoptosis in mice with I/R damage via activation of eNOS (Wu et al., 2011b). Intriguingly, both compound K (10 mg/kg per os) and ginsenoside Rb1 (40 mg/kg per os) reproduced the cardioprotective effects discussed above, in particular they reduced infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial swelling in rodent models of I/R injury (Tsutsumi et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2011c).",

A possible explanation is that, when designing clinical trials with the purpose of evaluating the effect of drugs on subjects with myocardial infarction or other severe heart diseases, hard endpoints are typically employed (e.g. cardiovascular morbidity or mortality, all-cause death, etc.) in order to highlight the most clinically important effects able to change the history and clinical course of the disease. Therefore, it is worth considering the difficulty, in clinical trials, in using medicinal herbs, such as ginseng, rather than a well-defined drug, for therapeutic purposes, in people at risk of death for cardiovascular diseases.

Fermented red ginseng (150 mg/kg/day per os for 8 weeks) decreased fasting blood glucose level and increased serum insulin and glucose tolerance in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (Jang et al., 2017). In a rat model of high-fructose diet-induced metabolic disorder, fermented red ginseng (250 mg/kg/day per os for 8 weeks) reduced hyperlipidemia and hypertension together with an up-regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporter (GLUT) type 4 in the muscle (Kho et al., 2016) (Fig. 1). In a well-known preclinical model of obesity (ob/ob mice), fermented red ginseng (0.5\u20131% in drinking water for 16 weeks) decreased body weight and blood glucose levels compared with control ob/ob animals; both GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 mRNA were increased in the ginseng group (Cheon et al., 2015). Korean red ginseng (400 mg/kg/day for 7 days) increased glucose-induced insulin release from Balb/c mouse islets and decreased apoptosis thus enhancing the metabolic function (Kim et al., 2016b). It is worth pointing out that compound K and ginsenoside Rb1 are responsible for the same effects on glucose metabolism ascribed to ginseng preparations (Chen et al., 2016b, Shen et al., 2015).",

In addition, Choi et al. (2012) reported that Korean red ginseng (50\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml) decreased the expression of both cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase and cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase - the enzymes responsible for hydrogen sulfide synthesis - in HUVEC. In this study, the Authors showed, in the same cell line, a ginseng-related decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules and enzymes, such as IL-6 and IL-8, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NOS (iNOS) (Choi et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Korean red ginseng effectively abrogated hydrogen sulfide-induced angiogenesis (Choi et al., 2012). Compound K (2.5\u201310 \u03bcg/ml) inhibited angiogenesis in HUVEC by suppressing sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced cell migration via modulation of sphingosine kinase-1 (Shin et al., 2014). Likewise, compound K inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis in HUVEC through the reduced phosphorylation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt (Jeong et al., 2010). Lastly, compound K was shown to inhibit the viability of HL-60 human leukemia cells through the (i) activation of caspase-3, caspase 8 and caspase-9, (ii) loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, (iii) release of cytochrome c, (iv) mitochondrial translocation of Bid and Bax and (v) down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Cho et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Ginseng exhibited a remarkable antioxidant effect through the enhancement of the cell stress response, mainly by up-regulating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a member of the heat shock protein family (Dattilo et al., 2015, Mancuso and Barone, 2009) (Fig. 1). Heme oxygenase-1, exerts its pleiotropic effects by reducing heme concentrations, toxic under conditions of redox imbalance, producing the gaseous neuromodulator carbon monoxide and, ultimately, generating biliverdin, the precursor of the strong endogenous antioxidant bilirubin (Barone et al., 2009, Mancuso et al., 1997, Mancuso et al., 2008, Mancuso et al., 2012, Navarra et al., 2000). The upregulation of HO-1 is currently considered a conserved mechanism by which herbal products exert beneficial effects in many organs and tissues (Catino et al., 2016, Fetoni et al., 2015, Mhillaj et al., 2017). A water extract of Korean red ginseng (0.25\u20132 mg/ml) induced HO-1 expression through the activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in both HUVEC and neuron-like PC12 cells (Park et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2011). Furthermore, the cytoprotective effect of Korean red ginseng against free radical-induced damage was abolished either by specific silencing of the Nrf2 gene or administration of the HO inhibitor zinc-protoporphyrin-IX, thus suggesting the main role of HO-1 in ginseng-induced cytoprotection (Park et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2011). Compound K (25\u201350 \u03bcM) suppressed the cytotoxic activation of BV2 microglial cells challenged with bacterial endotoxin through the up-regulation of HO-1 (Park et al., 2012). Ginsenoside Rb1 (10\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml) inhibited 6-OH-DA-induced oxidative injury in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line through the Nrf2-related HO-1 overexpression (Hwang and Jeong, 2010).",

Unfortunately, clinical trials carried out to investigate this effect have given rise to rather contrasting results. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study included 90 subjects (21 men and 69 women) experiencing chronic fatigue for more than 6 months; the randomization lead to the formation of three groups, 30 subjects each receiving, daily and for 4 weeks, either placebo or 250 mg soft capsules with an ethanol extract of P. ginseng titrated to contain 1 or 2 g of P. ginseng (Kim et al., 2013b). The individuals treated with P. ginseng did not have any significant effects on fatigue severity with respect to the placebo group (Kim et al., 2013b). However, the mental fatigue symptoms, but not physical symptoms, significantly improved by both 1 g and 2 g P. ginseng compared with the placebo groups (Kim et al., 2013b). Interestingly, in these subjects, P. ginseng, at both the doses, reduced reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation and increased reduced glutathione compared to the placebo group (Kim et al., 2013b).",

            "text": "Regarding the effect of P. ginseng on cognition, Geng et al. (2010) published an extensive systematic review which included nine randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (eight of which enrolled healthy participants) and concluded there was no convincing evidence to support the cognitive enhancing effect of ginseng. Following this report, additional clinical studies in literature described the beneficial effects of Cereboost\u2122 (100\u2013400 mg per os) on the short-term working memory performance in both 52 middle-aged healthy adults (Ossoukhova et al., 2015) and 32 healthy young adults (Scholey et al., 2010). Although these Authors did not provide any direct evidence about the mechanism(s) underlying the nootropic effect of Cereboost\u2122, they speculated a possible role for the activation of both cholinergic and dopaminergic brain systems and modulation of NO production. With regard to dementia, Heo et al., 2011, Heo et al., 2012 reported the beneficial effects of Korean red ginseng, in doses ranging from 1.5 to \u20134.5 g/day to 4.5\u20139.0 g/day per os for 24 weeks, on the cognitive performance of subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) (N = 30) or moderately severe AD (N = 30). In these groups, ginseng significantly improved both ADAS-Cog test (which evaluates memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities) and MMSE test (which evaluates orientation, attention, calculation, language and basic motor skills). The same Authors, confirmed the beneficial effects of Korean red ginseng up to 96 weeks of treatment on subjects with probable AD (Heo et al., 2011). Similarly, positive results on cognitive skills and memory function were described by Lee et al. (2008) who treated 58 patients with AD with P. ginseng powder (4.5 g/day per os for 12 weeks). The reduction of both A\u03b21-42 and tau protein neurotoxicity together with the potentiation of cholinergic pathways and the enhancement of long-term potentiation are among the determinants of this ginseng-induced neurocognitive improvement in AD subjects (Heo et al., 2011). Intriguingly, ginseng showed beneficial effects as an adjuvant treatment in subjects suffering from mood disorders and psychosis. Jeong et al. (2015) showed how Korean red ginseng (3 g/day per os for 8 weeks) improved residual symptoms in 35 female individuals who remitted from major depression and hypothesized multiple mechanisms, including the NO-mediated modulation of the stress axis and the increased production of NA, DA and 5-HT. Regarding mood disorders and their adverse effects, Chen and Hui (2012) reported the beneficial effects of HT1001\u2122 (200 mg/day per os for 4 weeks), an extract of P. quinquefolius consisting of a mixture of ginsenosides Rb, Rg1 and other bioactive phytochemicals, on extrapyramidal symptoms in 64 subjects with schizophrenia and claimed, as a possible mechanism, the ACh-mediated regulation of DA transmission.",

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 100 healthy volunteers, Lee et al. (2012) reported that Korean red ginseng (3 g/day per os for 12 weeks) significantly reduced the episodes of acute respiratory illness (ARI), mainly due to rhinovirus and coronavirus infections, in the 50 subjects randomized in the treatment arm with respect to the 50 individuals in the control group. A patented poly-furanosyl-pyranosyl-saccharide-rich extract of P. quinquefolius, COLD-fX, showed a beneficial effect on common cold. As described by Predy et al. (2005), who conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 323 healthy volunteers who had contracted at least two colds in the past year, COLD-fX (200 mg twice a day per os for 4 months) significantly reduced the proportion of subjects with two or more Jackson-verified colds compared to the placebo group. The P. quinquefolius extract significantly reduced also the total symptom score and the total number of days of cold symptoms in the ginseng-treated group (Predy et al., 2005). In a similar clinical trial carried out on 43 community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older, the 22 subjects in the COLD-fX group (200 mg twice a day per os for 4 months) reported a significant reduction of ARI and ARI-related symptoms during the last two-months of treatment (McElhaney et al., 2006). The anti-infective effect of ginseng can be ascribed to both the strengthening of immune functions (see also Section 3.1) and the direct inhibition of virus replication (Lee et al., 2012). Scaglione et al. (1996) designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 227 volunteers to study the effect of a standardized P. ginseng extract, Ginsana G115 (100 mg/day per os for 12 weeks), on both common cold and influenza. These Authors showed a significant decrease in the incidence of common cold or influenza illness in the G115 group between weeks 4 and 12 (Scaglione et al., 1996). Interestingly, subjects treated with the ginseng extract had an increase in anti-influenza antibody titers and natural killer cell activity (Scaglione et al., 1996). However, due to their heterogeneity, these clinical studies are unsatisfactory to guarantee a therapeutic effect of ginseng in such pathologies.",

(2010) conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial on 643 subjects with chronic atrophic gastritis who received Korean red ginseng extract powder 1 g/week per os for 3 years and followed for 8 years. Among these 643 patients, 24 developed cancers during the 11 years, in particular lung and stomach cancers (14 out for 24). The Authors reported a significant reduction of relative non-organ-specific cancer risk in male subjects treated with Korean red ginseng compared to the placebo group (Yun et al., 2010). Further studies focused on the role of ginseng in contrast to cancer-related fatigue. In an open label study, Yennurajalingam et al. (2015) evaluated the effect of P. ginseng (800 mg/day per os for 29 days) in 30 patients affected by cancer-related fatigue. In these subjects, P. ginseng reduced fatigue and improved both quality of life and appetite and sleep at night (Yennurajalingam et al., 2015). Similar results had been shown by Barton et al. (2013), who included 364 cancer survivors in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial; these subjects received 2 g/day P. quinquefolius per os for 8 weeks and the fatigue evaluated. A significant improvement of cancer-related fatigue was detected at 8 weeks, and the greatest benefit was reported in patients still receiving an active cancer treatment (Barton et al., 2013). Among the possible mechanisms through which ginseng could affect cancerogenesis, worth mentioning are the inhibition of angiogenesis and the down-regulation of cellular pathways, such as iNOS or COX-2 (see also Section 3.5). Concerning the beneficial effects of ginseng in preventing cancer-related fatigue, these seem to be linked to the reduction of inflammatory processes and modulation of cortisol release through the stress axis.",

However, vaginal bleeding and mastalgias have been reported by some patients due to the estrogenic effect of ginseng (Greenspan, 1983, Kabalak et al., 2004, Oh et al., 2010, Palmer et al., 1978). In patients taking high doses of P. ginseng (more than 2.5 g/day) central nervous system (CNS) effects have been reported, such as insomnia (Coon and Ernst, 2002, Scaglione et al., 1996), tachyarrhytmias (Kabalak et al., 2004), hypertension (Siegel, 1980) and nervousness (Coon and Ernst, 2002, Siegel, 1979). Other reported adverse effects of P. ginseng are headaches and gastrointestinal disorders (Coon and Ernst, 2002).",

Due to its well-known estrogen-like effect, ginseng should be used with extreme caution in women taking progestogens for the possible worsening of side effects of the latter (Greenspan, 1983, Punnonen and Lukola, 1980). Subjects treated with warfarin or other anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, should avoid taking ginseng-based supplements due to the high risk of bleedings (Chen and Hui, 2012, Coon and Ernst, 2002, Janetzky and Morreale, 1997). Subjects receiving digoxin or corticosteroids should also be cautious when taking ginseng (Chen and Hui, 2012, Dasgupta and Reyes, 2005, Miller, 1998).

Ginsana G115 administered to beagle dogs in doses up to 15 mg/kg for 90 days did not cause any sub-chronic toxicity (Hess et al., 1983). Chronic studies in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice treated with P. ginseng at doses up to 5000 mg/kg for 2 years did not show any toxic effect; furthermore, no increases in the incidence of cancer or non-neoplastic lesions were detected (National Toxicology Program, 2011).",

(2004) and Liu et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006, ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1 and Re were responsible for embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in rodent whole embryo cultures. For this reason, P. ginseng should be considered with caution during the first trimester of gestation (Chan et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006, Seely et al., 2008). Hess et al. (1982) studied the safety of Ginsana G115 on growth, reproduction, lactation and maturation of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. At doses ranging from 1.5 to 15 mg/kg per os, Ginsana G115 did not show adverse effects on the reproductive parameters evaluated or treatment related effects on animal behavior, physical appearance or food consumption (Carabin et al., 2000, Hess et al., 1982). Dietary mixtures of purified P. ginseng at doses of 1% and 5% for 60 days did not cause any significant change in the weight of the testis, epididymis or seminal vesicles; interestingly, rats in the 5% group exhibited a marked increase in testosterone plasma levels (Carabin et al., 2000, Fahim et al., 1982). A systematic review by Seely et al. (2008) suggested that breast-feeding women should not be supplemented with P. ginseng.",

At concentrations up to 36 mg ginseng extract/ml of culture media, no mutagenic response was detected (Carabin et al., 2000, Chang et al., 1986). Interestingly, in cultured Chinese hamster V79 cells, P. ginseng (0\u20131 mg/ml) inhibited DNA synthesis, but increased the rate of DNA excision repair processes upon treatment with ultraviolet radiation or methyl methanesulfonate (National Toxicology Program, 2011, Rhee et al., 1991). Furthermore, ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 exhibited anti-mutagenic activity in S. typhimurium strain TA100 (Ohtsuka et al., 1995, National Toxicology Program, 2011).",

Moreover, ginseng has had nearly no toxic effects in case of controlled intake. However, Siegel (1979) described a \u201cginseng abuse syndrome\u201d characterized by previously described symptoms of CNS hyperactivity, skin eruptions and morning diarrhea, although it became evident in the case of high dose intake of ginseng (up to 15 g/day). Thus, considering the consumption of ginseng in the Western and in the Eastern world, its intake merely at toxic doses, should be considered scarcely frequent although it cannot be completely ruled out. It is worth focusing on the intake of ginseng products by subjects receiving cardiac, antidepressants and anti-hemorrhagic medications for possible side effects.",
