In patients intolerant of penicillins, erythromycin may be prescribed but a significant proportion of H. influenzae will not be susceptible to this regimen. A five-day course length is recommended. 28 Resistant bacterial otitis media is recognisable by the persistence of signs and symptoms after three or more days of antibiotic therapy. In this circumstance bacteria resistant to the empirical regimen may be implicated, 32 eg isolates of M. catarrhalis that possess a beta-lactamase conferring resistance to amoxicillin. In these cases therapy should be changed; 29 a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as co-amoxiclav may be used as a second-line agent, or azithromycin for penicillin-allergic patients. 33 Adjunctive measures such as decongestants and antihistamines are unlikely to be of benefit and have the potential for unwanted side-effects. 34 Recurrent otitis media is defined as three or more episodes of otitis media in six months. It has been associated with hearing loss and consequent speech delay; it would, therefore, be desirable to limit episodes of AOM for this reason, the associated morbidity notwithstanding. A review of the use of long-term antibiotics to prevent otitis media indicated that they may be beneficial in reducing episodes, but no evidence indicating improvement in long-term outcome was available. 35 Additionally, the effect of longterm systemic therapy on promoting antibiotic resistance was not addressed, so long-term therapy might be cautiously recommended only where benefit is likely to outweigh risk.",

Bacterial pathogens, if present, may then multiply.The aetiology of AOM has been defined by specimens obtained via tympanocentesis demonstrating that Strep. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens followed by Moraxella catarrhalis, with Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus being rare.
