Since the real origin of infection is still not fully confirmed, a complete control of infection in Wuhan is essential for a sustained control in the whole country.Will there be any near-term resurging of cluster cases in other parts of China, including regions in Hubei beyond Wuhan, capital of the province? The random cases can be quickly put under control given the highly alert local monitoring systems and well-practiced healthcare teams\u2019 effective work over the last several weeks. But the cluster cases may pose a new threat for their potential to generate another regional outbreak.Will the world, especially those countries less prepared or with less healthcare resources, be able to handle the sudden appearance of cases at their doorstep? The assumption of persistent transmission of SARS-2 at a global scale may no longer be so far-fetched. Even if the virus does not bring a high mortality, the scenario of Community Acquired Coronavirus Infection (CACI) caused by a SARS type virus as part of our daily life will likely disrupt the world social and economic order.",

The immunopathogenesis plays a major role in SARS-2 infection and thus it is important to ensure that vaccines against this virus should not elicit the same type of detrimental immune responses. This will affect the type of vaccines to be selected and immunogens to be designed. Will a qualified manufacturing process be sufficient for the advancement of a candidate vaccine or it has to be validated? Can the manufacturing and regulatory experience achieved in other countries be applied to the review of a vaccine application in the current country? Can the cell banks or other intermediate products be accepted across country borders? Will the political or commercial considerations become the barriers to the global effort in addressing the urgent need of a SARS-2 vaccine?",

Within 18 years, the world has witnessed three major emerging pathogenic beta coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-2) entering large human populations.
