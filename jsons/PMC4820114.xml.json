            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are a frequent cause of medically attended illness in older adults and often require hospitalization. The management of mild acute respiratory infection in the outpatient setting is clear, as most infections are due to viruses, illnesses are self-limited, and data showing the safety and benefits of withholding antibiotics are robust.[1\u20134] Interventions to reduce unnecessary antibiotics can be focused on provider education and strategies to change behavior.[5\u201311] However, physicians who provide care for patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are faced with more challenging decisions. Data regarding the etiology of respiratory illnesses in hospitalized adults are incomplete and current microbial diagnostic tests frequently do not allow clinicians to rule out bacterial infection with certainty.[12\u201314] Highlighting the problem further, we recently reported that 39% of adults hospitalized with viral infections had evidence of bacterial co-infection.[15] Thus, it is not unreasonable when faced with diagnostic uncertainty to treat with antibiotics. Professional societies have espoused an approach de-emphasizing diagnostic testing and promoting empiric antibiotic treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP).[12, 16] In addition, the Center for Medicaid Services (CMS) has added pressure to quickly administer antibiotics as a quality measure for patients with pneumonia leading to treatment of many patients with \u201cpossible pneumonia\u201d that actually have other conditions.[17\u201319] The wisdom of these approaches in an era of rising rates of Clostridium difficile colitis and multi-drug resistant organisms is now being questioned.[20\u201321] The use of biomarkers and definitive viral diagnostic testing may provide more accurate targeting of antibiotics to those most likely to benefit, and minimize adverse outcomes.[22\u201324]",

Importantly, antibiotic duration was significantly shorter in algorithm adherent versus nonintervention patients.

However, compliance with treatment algorithms, especially in patients with low PCT values, will be important if such trials are to be definitive in proving the value and safety of using PCT algorithms as a means of reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. Analysis of our clinical trial data found that there was a trend towards algorithm non-adherence in subjects with higher WBC, a positive adequate sputum culture, a possible infiltrate on CXR, and an admission diagnosis of pneumonia (Table 2), with only the latter being statistically significant. Consistent with these results, our survey identified positive adequate bacterial sputum cultures, abnormal peripheral blood counts, possible infiltrate on chest radiograph, as well as age and severity of illness as factors frequently considered by providers as \u201cvery or somewhat important\u201d in deciding to override algorithm recommendations. While each of the above appear to be a reasonable factor when assessing patients for the likelihood of bacterial infection, many studies have shown that such clinical variables lack sensitivity and specificity in predicting bacterial infection.[44\u201347] Finally, though given less weight by providers, patient expectations, medical legal issues and antibiotics started in the emergency room were all at least \u201csomewhat important\u201d considerations in decision making.

However when coupled with good clinical judgment, such guidelines and algorithms may improve overall outcomes. In future trials it will be important to prospectively monitor a more thorough assessment of the reasons why a physician might choose to overrule algorithm recommendations.",

Our analysis suggests that addition of viral testing to a PCT algorithm is useful, and we have identified a number of issues that may be amenable to education. Our results should assist in design of definitive US randomized clinical trials of PCT guided algorithms, as these will be most influential in clinician acceptance of biomarker based approaches for the management of respiratory infections in adults.",
