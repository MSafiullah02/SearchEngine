Tropical medicine has caused unnecessary debate among African health experts and the former colonizers, or others, who have used the two words loosely. It is important that this distraction from the real health issues be dealt with here before it causes further confusion when addressing the most important concepts of public health, medicine, and global health. This much we know on the controversy. It is agreed that the concept of tropical medicine started during the nineteenth century in British, French, and German laboratories and schools of medicine whose primary motive was to care for the health of the army and the European administration living in tropical climates, as is the case of 80% of the African continent. However, in trying to solve the problem of ill health, the pioneers of the tropical effort focused on disease without seriously thinking about the socioeconomic factors responsible for certain disease clusters and the various pathogenic agents.",

It is widely accepted today, for example, that in Africa, many of the contagious diseases, such as syphilis and smallpox, spread to the interior from the coast\u2014the preferred place for Europeans\u2014which allowed the newcomers to control the shipping industry, the welcoming and enhancement of the arrival of more colonizers, and the discharging of laborers from one area of the continent to another. The reasons and impact of the stigma associated with several diseases, such as leprosy and mental illness, and how to combat them received little attention then. Sadly, this neglect continued even with the emergence African universities and medical schools at the end of the colonial period. In fact, the spread of such diseases as influenza is related to population density and people\u2019s relation to disease vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, helminthes, and lice, resource allocation, social interaction, and relationships of power that influence social organization and space, and not simply to geographic characteristics, climate, and tropical location (Niang 2008: 29).",

            "text": "Many public health experts make a sharp distinction between the concepts and goals of public health and global health, between international health and tropical medicine, between health itself and its disciplines, and between population and individual health. For one, some maintain that \u201ctropical medicine has connection with [an] international [domain],\u201d which is somewhat inaccurate, because one can focus on tropical medicine [or public health] and not necessarily transcend a country\u2019s or colonial national boundaries. Due to its connection with the early years of colonialism, as noted above, tropical medicine originated among interested colonial doctors and scientists in England who described the state of Africa\u2019s health negatively while portraying themselves as the saviors of the continent. Eddleston notes in this context that, when the organization of European Schools of Tropical Medicine (TropMed Europe) met in Addis Ababa in 1997, \u201cwe were persuaded by our African colleagues that the term \u2018tropical medicine\u2019 still had patronizing colonial overtones and should be replaced by \u2018international medicine\u2019 although this decision was never implemented\u201d (Eddleston 2011: vi). Prominent historian Roy Porter (1997: 462) objected to the use of the concept as it created the wrong impression of \u201cIntrepid doctors going off to the steaming jungles and overcoming some of the most lethal diseases besetting mankind,\u201d as the greatest benefactors to mankind (Eddleston et al. 2011: v). To be sure, tropical medicine was defined by Manson in 1898 as the branch of medicine that focuses on the diseases \u201coccurring only, or which from one circumstance or another are specially prevalent, in warm climates,\u201d requiring \u201cthe necessary skills and experience needed to meet its special challenges: the zoology of vectors and reservoirs, hygiene, anthropology, economics, epidemiology and demographics as the mainstream medical sciences.\u201d",

            "text": "No wonder the replacement of the concept of tropical medicine with that of \u201cinternational medicine\u201d was never adopted. Indeed, talking about international medicine makes little sense because, as the preceding authors noted, tropical medicine asks several questions whose answers are extremely relevant to such continents as Africa, including those that are not in the tropics: issues of medicine chain; impact of the heat on medication; drying a blood film or staining a malaria film; stabilizing airways obstruction by using a \u201ca bloody tracheotomy\u201d; weighing patients quickly in a humid temperature; operating a hospital without electricity and clean water; sanitizing and sterilizing hospital needles and similar equipment; applying the technique of weighing patients and monitoring their fluid balance \u201cat the most peripheral levels of the health service\u201d; avoiding contamination in situations where water is scarce; and improving the methods that might offset the impact of mosquitoes, flies, rodents, germs, and parasites that thrive in humid climates and wet areas. These and myriad other health-related issues are important or less critical where geography presents advantages or disadvantages for managing health care more efficiently and more effectively. Thus, even though tropical medicine has local, international, and even global implications, it need not be international: it may be simply national or regional depending on its specific focus. This means that in dealing with diseases health experts must go beyond the concept because it is narrow in approach and confuses those who see health as determined by more factors than climate. In short, one must be careful when using the concept of tropical disease or diseases, which should mean that certain diseases are common in certain geographical locations and not that all found in such locations are tropical, as is the case with HIV/AIDS and SARS. Additionally, diseases appearing in cooler climates are not necessarily non-tropical, as many can adapt to any climate. As the world continues to shrink, the distinction between tropical and non-tropical becomes less accurate. Finally, one must consider genetic predisposition of an individual born in a tropical or cooler climate when trying to classify the disease.",

In the US, the resistance to imposing or promoting certain behaviors that public health professionals, practitioners, and advocates request is heightened when politicians and policy-makers claim that the field should be the domain of states rather than the federal government. This ideology has, for a long time, hurt the government\u2019s ability to act as the most important agent for the protection of people\u2019s health. In the US, such type of thinking is clearly underscored by the continued controversy over President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in March 2010 and declared constitutional by the Supreme Court in 2012.",

However, if one were to follow this logic to the extreme, as is the case among certain US politicians and pharmaceutical conglomerates, then one could simply posit that no state, federal, locality, or community has the right to regulate people\u2019s lives in so far as health is concerned and that only the individual can determine by himself his own conduct, even if this may result in an epidemic or a pandemic outbreak that affects everyone else. Such thinking demonstrates how absurd or unwise it is to reject the tenets and the sociopolitical requisites of public health. It is fortunate, at least for now, that this debate has not permeated discussions over the power of the African governments to legislate, survey, monitor, evaluate, fund, and advocate for certain types of policies designed to protect the health of the community and, consequently, that of the individual. This non-combative attitude in Africa has its roots in the colonial authoritarian regimes Africans inherited, the family and community-based traditions prevalent on the continent prior to the imposition of a system that focused on individualist capitalism interested only in the accumulation of material goods regardless of the methods used, one that sought instant or visible gratification brought about by the public health system. In the long run, however, a population-based approach is less expensive than a focus on individual disease cases and individual well-being.",

For a long time, in fact, mental disease remained neglected by the medical profession and even public health practitioners and scholars, and policy-makers globally, including the West. As a positive concept, the United Nations (UN) definition emphasizes the point that \u201csocial and personal resources as well as physical capabilities\u201d are all important elements for the health of the community (Lloyd and Morrow 2010). Public health is precisely what the two words mean, that is, \u201cthe state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being\u201d of the public \u201cand not merely the absence of disease\u201d in its midst.

However, it is agreed that definitions must be concise, precise, and relatively brief, while containing the essential elements that make something what it is, presenting a form of existence and operation that are unique to the subject been defined. In this light, Novick and Brown\u2019s definition seems to be too general to the extent that it needs some elaboration. Some definitions note, for example, that public health relies on a combination of science and art. Suppose there is no science, does one still have public health? What is science and who defines it? Can a community have public health without the element of art? What is art and who defines art? Aristotle gave us a simple principle for defining something: showing the specific genus and its unique species. By defining public health the way we have done over the past three decades or so, Africa and the less developed world may not have public health, which is only acceptable as long as we maintain the Eurocentric definition of science and art.",

Winslow\u2019s definition has received such negative criticism that renowned sociologist Paul Starr called it a downright subversive \u201c\u2014a conception [that is, if taken seriously, is an invitation to conflict.\u201d Starr continues his criticism: \u201cPublic health cannot make all these activities its own, without, someone, sooner or later, violating private beliefs or private property or the prerogative of other institutions\u2026Much of the history of public health is a record of struggles over the limits of its mandate\u201d (Starr 1982: 180). Starr further adds that, in the past, religious organizations opposed public health because it was perceived as officially introducing its own concepts of health and hygiene, while businessmen and merchants did not welcome the emerging field as they perceived it as encroaching upon their domain. At the end of the nineteenth century, physicians also vehemently objected to the impression that public health was infringing on the core of their medical profession.",

Thus defined, public health may be applicable to even ancient societies, including those found in Africa, because it does not make essential the subjective Western understanding of science, technology, and medical practices, as the identifying elements of the concept. The WHO makes two points in its discussion of the evolution of the field of public health and its belated acceptance as a one that the public needed, making a major contrast with the medical field and the unchallenged role of physicians. Battams notes that, for a long time, particularly in the aftermath of the Second World War,The nature of health issues became increasingly more medical and professional. The discovery of new drugs and other irrefutable medical progress laid the foundations for a strong belief in the ability of doctors and the health services to solve all the major health problems. Health policy became increasingly synonymous with medical care policy, with the debates centering on how we should finance and recruit personnel to an ever-swelling hospital sector.

This appeared to show both the impotency of physicians and the weakness of their clinical treatment of patients faced with infectious and non-communicable diseases. This understanding was highlighted and sharpened by the HIV/AIDS pandemic outbreak. Second was the fact that, for treatment and cure, enormous amounts of personal and governmental funds were being spent for years indefinitely, always escalating to such an extent that many people were unable to pay for the services they wished to receive.

First, it places the state at center stage, implying that, with no state, there is no public health. It further stresses the role of the \u201cmodern state\u201d rather than simply any state or any society that functions at the margins of society. Furthermore, the two authors restrict the term to the application of \u201cmodern, scientific medicine, and its administration through the use of rational principles.\u201d The problem, however, is that this conception of public health rules out any system in Africa or elsewhere prior to colonialism, especially among societies that had an egalitarian character or were stateless, such as the Ibo of Nigeria, given its emphasis on the modern state, the adoption of Eurocentric principles of science, and a \u201crational\u201d type of administration that refers to the way the Western world has organized the conduct of health care through structures that are often too bureaucratic, unaccountable, voracious, and universalistic, allowing for no exceptions for population segments, and culturally unsound. This description of public health and its role is problematic also in so far as pre-colonial and pre-modern African medical practices are concerned. Indeed, concerted initiatives aimed at preserving, promoting, and treating disease in populations were common and intricate parcels of health practices on the African continent prior to the Atlantic slave trade during the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries and the scramble for Africa during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century (1884\u20131905).",

Medicine or clinical practice, on the contrary, focuses primarily on the health of the individual and treatment of disease in clinical settings, to the extent that caring or curing one individual may not necessarily improve the health of the community. Medicine is, in a sense, a private, confidential, and individual practice, whereas public health is a communal act intended to prevent and control or eradicate all risks harmful to health\u2014now commonly called the social and environmental determinants of health following official endorsement of the concept by the WHO in 2008.

Including this element as a part of the definition would eliminate passive definitions that, leaving the agency out, would appear as coming out of the blue. Agency often comes from one health-focused individual, professional, researcher, or a small group of individuals. This needs prominence in the discussion of both medicine and public health. After noting that the public health profession differs from the clinical health professions in that the former encompasses many professional disciplines such as medicine, dentistry, nursing, optometry, nutrition, social work, environmental health sciences, health education, health services administration and the behavioral sciences, Medicine Network notes that its activities focus on entire populations rather than on individual patients (Medicine Network\n2014). Another way of expressing the most effective way of improving the health of all is targeting \u201cgeographic or otherwise defined populations, as an organizing principle.\u201d In fact, physicians have of late implicitly and explicitly acknowledged the importance of public health by enrolling in public health programs where they upgrade their knowledge and skills regarding, for example, the measurements of disease and its impact on populations, better understanding of the etiology of illness, and familiarity with the most recent best practices in the evolution of medicine itself and its application to the needs of the community at large.

This problem has been clearly highlighted by the dispute between some American doctors who deal with the Ebola virus treatment and European companies that have tried to discover drugs or vaccines against the deadly disease that erupted in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea recently as to the ethical process to prove the effectiveness and safety of a recommended intervention. Some experts, such as Dr. Kalil of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, argue that double-blind randomized trials that use drugs and placebos in a case-control study of diseases, such as Ebola, are the only ethical studies acceptable, of which Africa is being short-changed. As Nicole Lurie, US Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response put it, \u201cWe recognize the need for compassion and quick access to effective drugs for those in need,\u2026but history has taught that the best approach is to conduct rigorous controlled trials to determine both safety and effectiveness\u201d (The Wall Street Journal, May 13 2015: A7).

The most important caveat for anyone studying, reading, and applying public health is that this field has elements of natural and social science and the arts, the latter including the ability to assemble and integrate components of health to make results plausible or reasonable enough when weighed against science, strengthened by common sense and deeply embedded knowledge of people\u2019s behavior and culture.

These changes resulted in unprecedented population growth and consequently overcrowding in the cities, the appearance of slums, increased poverty among those who could not make it in the urban enclaves, the rapid spread of infectious diseases, and, therefore, in more deaths than expected. The result of the industrial revolution prompted Thomas Malthus to posit that, even though the population of England was growing too rapidly, death would be a natural balancing factor and that therefore there was no need of trying to slow down its impact. This thinking was disputed by many, including the emerging epidemiologists such as John Graunt, through his 1662 Bills of Mortality (his observations on mortality statistics from a plague outbreak in the City of London captured in government registries), and, later, William Farr, at times also known as one of the founders of modern epidemiology. Equally important is mentioning the British epidemiologist John Snow, who changed our perception of disease and suggested the ways to combat it. Thus, up until the 1980s, the consensus has been that epidemiology was born in England and \u201cexported\u201d to the New World, especially the US, as most of the first public health professionals including physicians were British and American.",

As a result, there are many types of studies that epidemiologists conduct to find health risks, sources of contagion and infection, types of diseases and their virulence, and their likely frequency and side effects, the nature of the disease environment, the appropriately administered and recommended remedies, interventions, or treatment. On one hand, stand the important epidemiological observational studies which are based on events or episodes that might trigger a response in people\u2019s immune system and impact their health status. In observational studies, the search is for the observable variables or data to understand or explain the likely outcome\u2014that is, good health, infection, infectivity, disability, disease, or death.

This criticism may have been justified some time ago but not currently because of peer review requirements and the level of improved and sophisticated methodologies in the field of public health. Critics must also remember that it is easier to study inanimate objects and non-humans than humans and societies, because of the latter\u2019s ability to manipulate data and information, conceal facts, hide feelings, and harbor preconceived or biased ideas. One might agree that it is much more difficult to be absolutely sure of one\u2019s \u201cscientific\u201d conclusions when dealing with people. Indeed, the inherent and potential problems apply to all sociobehavioral sciences, which have prompted Sharma Rausch, a Ph.D. psychologist at the US Homeland Security, heading the Human Factors/Behavioral Analysis Division at the Science & Technology Directorate, to affirm that it is the social sciences that are the harder sciences and not the natural sciences, which, more accurately, according to her, should be called the \u201csofter sciences\u201d and not the other way around. Summing up, as FAO says, \u201cInherent in the epidemiological approach is the belief that the frequency of occurrence of a disease in a population is governed by the interaction of a large number of different factors or determinants. Epidemiologists believe that by studying these interactions it may become possible to manipulate some of the determinants involved and so reduce the frequency with which the disease in question occurs in a population\u201d (FAO 2015: 1). As John Last wrote in 2002, epidemiology is an \u201cindispensable basic science of public health. It provides the logical framework for the facts that enable public health officials to identify important public health problems and to delineate their dimensions. Epidemiologic methods are used to define these health problems; to classify, identify, and elucidate their causes; and to plan and evaluate rational control measures\u201d (Last 2002: 1).",

As expected, in the course of its long evolution since the mid-eighteenth century but particularly the nineteenth century and thereafter, following the firm entrenchment of the germ theory of disease (Kunitz 2007: 12), epidemiology has accumulated its own theoretical base derived from the series of studies it has conducted, many of which have resulted in the discovery and announcements of irrefutable or probable causes or association among risk exposure, infection, disease, disability, or death. One thing is clear at this juncture, namely, that true epidemiology is based on rigorous methods or protocols set for collecting data and information, selecting the subjects for studies, analyzing, interpreting, or synthesizing the results or findings. As Nancy Krieger notes, \u201cscientific observation [in epidemiology] is not a passive phenomenon of what we \u2018see\u2019 and our technical capacity to do so\u2026 In one sense, this means that meaningful observation is, at some level, theory-laden: what we \u2018see\u2019 depends in part on what our ideas are about what we expect to see and what assumptions underlie the methods used to \u2018observe\u2019 the data\u201d (Krieger 2011: 24). What constitutes the wrong or unethical approach in epidemiological studies is the manipulation of the results or the research process itself to suit preconceived ideas or ideologies, as some social and even natural scientists have been accused of doing, reflected, for example, in the vehement attacks from some conservative circles on those scientists that claim that climate change is a hoax designed to advance their liberal theories.",

Retrospective studies are historical in nature, while prospective are forward looking, as is the case with the cohort studies, in which prevalence baseline gives place to the events, such as exposure to risk, infection, death, or disease that occur during follow-up. Ecologic studies focus on populations and not individuals, which may span diverse countries and geographic locations and are often comparative in nature.

However, cohort studies tend to be more expensive than others and must therefore be crafted very carefully because they may require a long follow-up and a large sample. This is where the concept of relative risk (RR) is used. In contrast, a case-control study is simply a cross-sectional observational retrospective study that uses subjects who have already suffered the impact of an exposure, weighed against healthy individuals\u2014the control group\u2014which is suspected of having been exposed to the same risk. The goal is to find the causes or the associations that might have resulted in disease or death. The major group of interest here is actually the case and not the control group, in an attempt to find out why they turned sick or died. A case-control study may not need a large sample, and therefore tends to be cheaper, and does not require follow-up like the cohort study, and the determination of risk is done through the odds ratio (OR) that provides the ratio of likelihood that a non-exposed person in the control group versus one exposed individual in the case group may end up contracting the disease. In contrast, a valid clinical trial, which is designed to answer the questions what, where, when, how, why, who, and which, requires a randomized selection of individuals who share the same exposures and risks and who have other similar characteristics that make them equally qualified to be participants in the study. Most often, a clinical trial requires some type of blinding of the subjects, the investigators, and often the analysts, a process called triple blinding, to ensure that the results are not biased. Blinded individuals will not know in advance who was subjected to an intervention, such as a drug or a vaccine, and who was administered a placebo (Bhuyan et al. 2015: 254).",

The minimum requirement of his or her research or detective activity is to at least find scientific probability. Thus, as a detective, the epidemiologist protects the lives of a population through consistent disease surveillance and by being the first source of information and analysis when an unexpected disease outbreak occurs in a locality. Most of the epidemiologists are also part of the other public health disciplines and serve as physicians, as is the case in Africa.

Therefore, the rigor of the research techniques, study relevance, and ability to acquire funding are major hurdles in the conduct of most studies. These are constraints that all developing countries, including those in Africa, face daily. Funding shortages, the dearth of trained personnel, slow turn-around permission from the authorities to conduct research, unnecessary bureaucracy, poor and decaying, dilapidated infrastructure, and obstacles generated by ethnic preferences, make it very difficult for African scholars to undertake and complete meaningful and externally valid studies. Sheba Gate et al. note that, among others, one of the many shortcomings of epidemiological endeavors in Africa \u201c\u2026is the weakness of the public health (and clinical) laboratory networks which are critical for effective public health surveillance especially for communicable diseases\u201d (Gate et al. 2011: 1).",

Spark alerts us about the distinction between the concepts of nutrition and public health and nutrition in public health or public health nutrition. Nutrition and public health denotes an independent discipline or a discipline co-existent alongside public health. Even though the two may be separately considered at times, they are normally used synonymously and fit the definition provided above. As a public health discipline, nutrition\u2019s ultimate functions are the surveillance and monitoring of risk factors, employing a community-focused approach for assessment, program planning, evaluation, leadership and population based interventions, and leadership in promoting access and quality related to the nutritional needs of a population. For Africa, this discipline is absolutely critical. Malnutrition affects over half of Africa and is responsible for most underweight at birth as well as for older children, who, as a result, grow stunted and are unable to combat disease due to a compromised immune system that normally should help them fight infectious and chronic diseases.",

On the effect of malnutrition on host defense mechanisms, for example, after pointing out that it is best described as the result of loss of protein, carbohydrate fat in the body, and changes in micronutrients\u2014vitamins and minerals\u2014the two experts write:A common finding in malnourished patients is the depletion of lymphocytes, particularly in T-cell regions of thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Studies suggest that there is a relative reduction in circulating mature T lymphocytes (both helper T and suppressor T cells) so that plasma is enriched with immature and functionally defective cells. As a result, there is a reduction in the efficacy of all host defenses that depend on T-cell function. Serum antibody levels are usually normal or elevated in the presence of malnutrition. This may be due in part to the numerous infections and high antigenic loads faced by malnourished individuals in impoverished areas, and at the same time, a defect in suppressor T-cell function, which normally inhibits antibody production.

In East and Southern Africa, some 25 million or 40% of children under five are victims of stunting or irreversible low weight for their age, or have chronic malnutrition. Furthermore, while 18% of the under-fives are underweight, that is, too small for their age, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 7\u201342% of the children live with acute malnutrition, or wasting, defined as a quick weight loss due to illness and from not having enough to eat. While stunting is \u201ca measure of protein-energy malnutrition, indicated by low weight for age or failure to achieve expected stature,\u201d wasting is a \u201cmeasure of protein-energy malnutrition that occurs when a child\u2019s weight for height falls significantly below what is expected in the reference population\u201d (Last 2000: 28).",

            "text": "In Africa, malnutrition often begins with the poor nutritional conditions of pregnant women, affecting negatively the yet unborn child. One form of malnutrition is manifested in the disease that is called pellagra. Pellagra is an Italian word that means rough skin, which can still be found in South Africa, even though few cases of it exist in the rest of the continent today. It used to be common in refugee camps, as was the case in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, DRC, and Angola during the 1980s and 1990s. Pellagra is caused by deficiency in the niacin B-Vitamin complex group, which, biologically, is \u201ca generic descriptor for pyridine 3-carbonylic acid and derivatives which exhibit qualitatively the biological activity of nicotinamide\u201d (Prinzo 2000: 10). Too much reliance on rice, corn, pork meat, and molasses is known to be a major culprit. In its worse stages, pellagra can result in diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death. The disease is almost extinct but it was a major problem in Africa during the 1930s, when it was discovered. The first doctors to treat the disease, which can deform one\u2019s skin, described it as early as 1937, when they wrote that it was:\u2026An endemic disease which has been described in certain African tribes both on the East and West coast and also in Central Africa. It is characterized by an acute course progressing usually towards a fatal termination in the second and third month. It displays itself by edema [swelling] which is often severe, a rash which in some respects is unlike the classical description of that in pellagrous adults, diarrhea, dysentery, and perhaps fatty stools. Only a few cases develop obvious neurological signs. Differing thus from the more common but slow and remittent type of the disease as seen in adults no clinical observer who has recorded cases in Africa has been able to agree that it is pellagra. It is known variously as in Africa as \u2018Gillan\u2019s edema,\u2019 \u2018Williams disease,\u2019 and malnutrition edema, and is believed to be a new clinical entity. (Trowell 1937: 70)\n",

Kwashiorkor is a severe condition of malnutrition, a word that was introduced in the medical lexicon during the 1930s by a Caribbean (Jamaican) pediatrician by the name of Cecily Williams. This disease, which some confuse for pellagra, is also a result of lack of protein from such foods as meat, cheese, eggs, fish, nuts, seeds, beans, soy, and specific grains, including quinoa, as well as milk. Just like pellagra, kwashiorkor, in Africa, we are told by nutritionists and biologists, is often associated with war, frequent famines, and natural disasters, such as floods and drought. Its symptoms are fatigue, diarrhea, edema (swelling), damaged immune system, protruding large belly, enlarged liver, flaky rash, shock, change in skin color and hair, muscle mass loss, irritability, and physical inability to grow.",

Many health ministries, public health practitioners, African leaders, and communities have heeded the growing and acknowledged need for proper nutrition of children, women, HIV/AIDS orphans, widows, and senior citizens. In summary, Africa\u2019s malnutrition rates must be fought from all angles and sectors, including food security, agricultural production, and child and maternal health. Poverty is a major cause of hunger and malnutrition, but hunger is as well one of the causes of poverty stemming from the inequities in the distribution of economic resources, income, political leaders\u2019 \u201cmalfeasance,\u201d and intermittent conflicts such as wars, and climatic fluctuations in the form of flooding, drought, and volcanoes, which may require abandonment of centuries-old farming and herding lifestyles and the introduction of crop diversification.

In such situations, the people most vulnerable to malnutrition and undernutrition have always been children under the age of five, unaccompanied others, chronically ill people, including those co-infected with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, all pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, individuals from households without an adult male, orphans, and certain underserved or discriminated against ethnic or religious minorities (Levy and Sidel 2008). Malnutrition is aggravated by such infectious diseases as measles, diarrhea, and dysentery, which lead to loss of appetite and risk of malnutrition or undernutrition, and increase the metabolic rate exponentially. Invariably, such situations contribute to acute malnutrition and lack of vital micronutrients such as vitamin A and tend to exacerbate other physical and nutritional deficiencies. It is easy now to measure nutritional levels through BMI or body mass index. However, according to Levy and Sidel (2008: 219), at time of emergencies, as happens in Africa, nutritional levels are usually measured through weight-to-weight, because \u201cweight is more sensitive than height to sudden changes in food availability.\u201d",

Yet, the realization of the nutritional deficiencies does not seem to ring a bell among many African leaders who do not believe that, by addressing the nutritional needs of these vulnerable populations, they would also raise the living standards of the nation as a whole, increase life expectancy at birth, and enable the containment or control of the high DALYs that stifle and choke economic growth and health quality. Recall that historian Geoffrey Rose argued with the founding fathers of epidemiology that adequate and healthy nutrition would prolong the population\u2019s life expectancy and surpass the need for vaccines and many of the interventions we design to fight disease. Healthy nutrition requires awareness, financial commitment from the state and its leaders, adequate infrastructure, sanitation, and hygiene, and safe food.

Prior to colonialism, people definitely understood how in general nutrition worked to save a child or a sick person, and most people survived from knowledge and experience of traditional practice and remedies. Consequently, they would adjust to the environment. Furthermore, soil contamination, chemicals that interfere with the growth of quality foods, unavailability of land to cultivate vital crops, the introduction of new diseases, and the rapidly disappearing animal kingdom, deforestation, desertification, and drought continue and will continue to prevent Africans\u2019 ability to be reasonably well-nourished. In most of the continent, the combination of malnutrition, defined here, as the lack of adequate quality food, and undernutrition, which may be described as lack of enough food intake, even if its quality is adequate, have disturbed the human development process, which was aggravated by frequent periods of hunger and famine during the colonial period in particular.",

Fortunately for Africa, the colonial harm can be reversed, but it appears that, despite calls from science, public health, and global organizations interested in populations\u2019 health, either due to ignorance or lack of concern, leaders in Africa do not respond to the crisis with urgency, especially in the villages.",

Conventionally, this word is used in a positive sense, implying the set of foods and liquids that are good, therefore, of quality, for the body. Malnutrition may refer to sufficient but not quality food intake, that is, consumption of deficient foods. Undernourishment or undernutrition means insufficient intake of good or bad foods undermining physical development and thus survival in good health.

On the individual, community, organizational, societal, and national, and now, global level, it is the core function of health education and promotion to allow people to change behavior, if deemed unhealthy, and embrace evidence-based healthy practices. Health education focuses on the dissemination and understanding of the risks and positive effects of certain behaviors, while promotion refers to urging individuals and communities to behave in certain ways. This is where the role of professionals and advocates is critical.

In the process, training the workforce, including academic and health professionals, is a necessary lifelong activity as the need for healthy behaviors will always be with us as human beings, given that we are constantly interacting with one another domestically and globally. Just like public health in general, behavioral promotion and education targets all determinants of health with the aim of reducing or eliminating inequalities or disparities that influence healthy or unhealthy behavior, such as the impact of fast food restaurants and businesses that pollute the air and contaminate our soil. This is the reason why, at times, behavioral health as a discipline is closely associated with environmental health, as reflected in its designation as \u201cBehavioral and Environmental Health\u201d that one sees in textbooks and government health instructions.",

In the developing world, where there is a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, behavioral health education and promotion is even more pressing. For Africa, the nature of this discipline, the application of its principles, and the body of knowledge it can provide to the community are all a part of the critical ingredients of the field of public health. Unfortunately, quite often, the relevant information is available to people but not the skills or will needed for them to modify their behavior. In other words, knowledge and skills rarely go together in Africa, a continent that is viewed globally as having one of the weakest health systems, programs, and outcomes in this arena. In the words of Dennis Raphael in the Oxford Health Promotion International some time ago (2000), in Africa, \u201cthe major distinguishing features included the incorporation of cultural and spiritual factors, emphasis on the community, and emphasis on health promotion as a set of tools rather than a process.\u201d The last dimension implies that imparting information and skills is the key strategic option.",

Third, long-held cultural practices continue to hinder much progress in the health and other sectors, most of which have direct or indirect impact on the spread and prevention of diseases on the continent. We are also advised that \u201chealth promoters should not look at the role of culture as a barrier but rather embrace the cultural dimension in health and not equate health development to Westernization,\u201d which seems to be the case in most of Africa. Recall that people will change behaviors if there is an incentive, if the outcome is what they expected, and are self-convinced that they can do it (Govender 2005: 39\u2013420). Fourth, there are competing forces and agents in Africa, including the governments themselves, which pit one health organization against another, or overlapping activities that are not coordinated to achieve one clearly defined and targeted goal. On this, Health Promotion International observes that, \u201cIn Africa, there exists an undeclared war for supremacy among different practitioners. While there seems consensus that health education practitioners are the protagonists of this \u2018war,\u2019 medical doctors, nurses, and professionals from areas seen as social mobilization, behavioral change, communication and social marketing are jostling for niches in a complex pecking order\u201d (WHO 2001). Furthermore, lack of effective data collection methods and analysis for outcomes assessment are at their initial stage and little research is conducted by governments and their scholars on the subject of behavioral change. Even worse, for the past 20 years, autonomous schools and programs of public health that would strengthen the role of education and promotion in Africa have been rare.",

Finally, as a thesis of this volume, there is a vacuum of effective, informed, visionary, and committed leadership. It is important to mention as well that strategies for behavioral change did not reach Africa before implementation of the Bamako Initiative in 1987. Many of the relevant targets and strategies, imported from former mother countries, were, therefore, not based on the real needs of the Africans. Yet, to fill this imbalance, African universities have not created more autonomous public health degree programs apart from just offering courses that are simply appendages to the medical schools.

This is a kind of education [he continues] that is appropriate in a lifelong learning situation\u201d (Ebewo 2008: 471). The power of theater and drama was highlighted in an evaluation of a program implemented in Lesotho and Botswana, which showed theater to be \u201ca powerful tool for community education, one which captured the minds of communities and sensitized them to the spread of HIV/AIDS and the need for prevention and imparted skills for care and support\u201d (see Gasennelwe and Rantona 2000). Challenges include \u201cthe need for multi-sectoral collaboration and Ministries leadership, paucity of human resources and stable funding, and the limited research and evaluation of best practices\u201d (McNab et al. 2013: 246\u2013259). Others point to the need to invest in distance learning technologies, both educational and technical, to optimize the available human and financial resources. However, nothing effective will impact health promotion and education until the presidents and the remaining kings, relics of the distant past, as well as the ministries of health in Africa realize the need for change and advocacy, appropriating the needed funds, and taking action to implement robust programs and activities that aim at creating people awareness and changing health behaviors. As things stand right now, the vision and human seem to be missing, while the universities and medical schools continue to pay lip service through a few courses here and there so often under the \u201ccommunity health\u201d or \u201ccommunity medicine\u201d banner. A study conducted on public health programs in Africa published in 2007 showed the following realities: Overall, out of 53 countries at the time, 54.7% offered no postgraduate training in public health. Eleven countries, 20.7%, had one program. Eleven others or 20% had more than one program, almost all located in Anglophone countries of Sub-Saharan and Northern Africa. Very few postgraduate programs in Francophone, Portuguese, and Hispanophone countries existed, the Portuguese showing the worse record, where 91% of the population lived without any public health program whatsoever, followed by (Spanish) Equatorial Guinea at 34%.

The external domain, on the other hand, includes issues of licensing or licensure, accreditation of related programs by bodies such as the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH), regulations for the industry and the specific ideal organization, CEOs, stakeholders\u2019 views and relations, think tanks, business process managers, competitive rival organizations and groups, Medicaid and Medicare (so specifically called in the United States), and insurance or insurers and managed care organizations (Buckbinder and Thompson 2010: 4).",

In this context, health care administrators or managers operate from a population-based framework: they measure population status, analyze the issues and determinants of health, and recommend and implement interventions, set priorities, take action, assess and evaluate outcomes, institute measures of accountability, and ensure that resources are appropriate and spent efficiently and effectively, and preserve the quality of care, which is a tall order in poor countries.",

Health managers, therefore, must be hired using procedures that respect the training, experience, and the ethical conduct of the applicants through merit rather than acquaintance, kin, or family ties\u2014unlike many of the hiring practices in Africa. In policy and management, the organizational structure is usually presented in a pyramidal form (say the experts), clarifying the hierarchy and the various types of responsibility and the chain of command, specifying who is in charge of what and of whom, determining whether one is to work alone or in a team or unit, and the overall structure of the type of care. Within this context, the manager or administrator is expected to work to improve the quality and direction of the organization and hire and retain the appropriate individuals, aspects that are often run over by health systems on the continent, \u201cshaping health policy,\u201d and \u201csuccession planning.\u201d",

Because health care policy and management is one discipline of public health that recommends, manages, and allocates funds for the health of the population, those in position of responsibility are expected to be impeccable in character and ethical in their private and public behavior. As David Eboh (2013) has written about Africa, \u201cHealthcare is one of the key public services that require significant investment of public fund. As a result, health care institutions need the skills, knowledge, experience and competence of the people that are primarily trained and qualified in the field of business leadership and corporate strategic management, who can think outside the box about ways to maximize clinical productivity, economic profitability, income sustainability, organizational growth and services expansion/contraction.\u201d Simply put, health policy and management focuses on the provision of effective, efficient, and equal access of health services to the individual and the population. Finally, we might summarize the major distinctions between clinical sector management and non-clinical sector management, as the James Lind Institute does:Healthcare managers in the clinical sector work on provision of quality and efficient control in costs, implementation of novel technology methods such as electronic medical records, recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals to ensure that it is in compliance with changing regulations, reimbursement and implementation of programs to improve the health of communities. In the non-clinical sectors, managers work in enrollment of health insurance benefits, health care marketing, and health information, provider networking contracts, pharmacy benefit management, medical devices, health policy and biomedical consulting.

The excuse of lack of resources is always used by leaders to justify their shortcomings and the weakness of the system. Since the revision of many primary health care systems in Africa at the Ouagadougou Conference (see Ouagadougou Declaration on Primary Health Care Revitalization), under the auspices of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNAIDS, AFDB, and the World Bank in 2008, African states are at varying stages of strengthening the managerial and policy aspect of public health. Some countries have decided to make the system community-based, while immediately strengthening district systems in capacity building, planning, management, integration of activities, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation. In contrast, while others have decided to use their scarce resources on high impact interventions and develop the tools to accomplish the goals, others have focused, at least in theory, on quality assurance and rapid assessment. In terms of the Health Policy and Management, the conference underscored the need to strengthen capacity in policy analysis for the WHO African Region (World Health Organization 2014a, b, c, d: 1\u20133).",

There is no doubt that not every aspect of the health care system is always working in a crisis mode. However, the fact that health care is impacted by almost everything people and the government do, one sector will not run smoothly, if part of it is \u201cill.\u201d Most analysts today will agree with Morfaw\u2019s study (2008: 249) which showed that: \u201cActually, the African health-care industry is experiencing serious management, organizational, and structural problems. Isolated examples of excellence are not the goal, but system-wide quality,\u201d which requires the use of a total quality control approach to prune and improve the whole system, a strategy proven effective by the physicist W. Edwards Deming who saved the Japanese economy during the 1980s. The WHO has made it clear that a good system to be called such must have the six building blocks in quality and shape on a scale that benefits efficiently and effectively its citizens, whose application in health care is recommended by Morfaw (2008).",

It has been noted by the WHO and Africa\u2019s health care systems analysts that the workforce in Africa is not only small but also not well-trained; supervision of doctors is minimal; data collection is one of the weakest among the various continents compared; resources are not used efficiently; high level of bribery and corruption go hand-in-hand; the quality of drug provision is wanting in every respect; and the infrastructure allowing faster mobility of the patient transport system is missing or functioning at a minimal level. As a result of the globalizing technological advances in communication and the expansion of telephones, IPads, fax machines, the Internet, the desk computer and the laptop, the radio, the smartphone and the newspapers (which are still popular in Africa), the continent has, in a sense, undergone a radical change in the way people communicate with each other and how fast news is spread, prompting Adebayo Fayoyin to write excitingly that Africa is no longer on the \u201cperiphery\u201d in the flow of global information or \u201closing out\u201d or \u201cneglected in the global highway of information.\u201d Fayoyin then adds:While we do not suggest that information asymmetry has been totally eliminated on the continent, it is noteworthy that advances in digital technology have created a data revolution in Africa [author\u2019s emphasis]. The continent has one of the highest levels of digital penetration in the world and young people are now more connected via social media then before. In many African countries, there are initiatives [that are] revolutionizing the pattern and flow of information and enhanc-ing a vibrant culture of data utilization. (Fayoyin 2014: 530).",

If one starts from zero and reaches 100 feet in a matter of decades when others start at 100 and reach 1000, the achievement might be impressive but it is comparatively inadequate. Furthermore, it all depends, as is the case with health, on whether one refers to communicating at long distances or reporting instantly events of great importance that affect populations and the state of health indicators, such as epidemics, which require advanced and consistent surveillance\u2014as we learned from the Ebola virus in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone: The quality and nature of the \u201ccommunication\u2019s revolution\u201d may be superficial. One is quite sure that data on sports attendance and scores, tourists\u2019 arrivals at airports, and money transfers from abroad that go through the proper channels are documented in Africa, but not the vital issues and data on health. However, the rate of fund disap-pearance, for example, that fuels corruption cannot be accounted for; data needed after an epidemic outbreak; hard information necessary to forecast earthquakes and floods; climatic changes and damage to water supplies; and acceptable and reliable records on maternal and child mortality at the hospitals and other health facilities have not experienced a revolution from the digital age. Hospital registries are still done by hand in most places, including the cities, and causes of death, if they are listed, are often unreli-able, at the time when globally known ways of ensuring some measure of accuracy are available.In other words, collection of critical data that count for economic development, health, and health care, is still in its infancy on the continent\u2014the reason why the UN and all its agencies have noted that this accurate and consistent information, which could be used to improve the lives of Africans, is one of the most serious shortcomings of the health systems on the continent. It is also important to remember that, besides the inaccuracy and the paucity of databases, many sources of information sought by researchers are unavailable and remain in secret vaults, underscoring incompetence, corruption, mismanagement, and lack of vision. Even Fayoyin (2014: 528\u2013530), who writes of an information revolution in Africa, is compelled to admit that:Although most governments have their own statistics divisions set up to collect and process data on various sectors, such as health and population, climate change, water management, etc., they rarely update the databank. In some cases it is impossible for the public (e.g., researchers, aid groups, companies) to obtain access to existing data due to bureaucratic red tapes, lack of appropriate legislation or policy and incompetence\u2026The external groups eventually turn to online publications and other secondary sources that are unreliable.\n",

The precarious condition in Africa regarding the issue at hand was highlighted by a 2008 study that showed that, out of 53 countries then, 50 provided 826 institutions that offered university or post-secondary education; out of 242 of these that had a website, 97 offered a statistics course or statistics-related programs; and among the latter, namely those with a website, only four universities in four separate countries offered a co-op or internship statistics program\u2014the University of Nairobi (School of Mathematics), the University of Ilorin in Nigeria through the Department of Statistics, the University of Zimbabwe in Harare, and the University of Kwazulu-Natal, Faculty of Science and Agriculture ( Thabane et al. 2008).

On air pollution, the Third African Environmental Outlook notes that, while outdoor pollution globally kills 800,000 people annually, mainly in urban areas, Africa accounts for 40,000 of the deaths per year. In fact, indoor pollution caused by smoke from cooking charcoal, heat, and prolonged exposure to second hand cigarette smoke has the highest effect in children, and, in Nigeria, studies have shown that quite often these conditions are responsible for such respiratory diseases as capillary bronchitis or bronchopneumonia and asthma. Frightening is the fact that scientists have estimated that home indoor pollution in Africa is higher than the pollution allowed in environmental pollution in industrialized countries. Thus, while in Angola, for example, according to a UNEP Report, 6.9% of the burden of disease comes from solid fuel use, in Malawi it accounts for 5.2% of the deaths.

It is now a topic that grapples the imagination of a dozen major international foundations, most of which are discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-32461-6_3. As a result, it has caught the attention of those who believe that health is a right of all people and that globalization, particularly in terms of communication advances, economic expansion worldwide, and technological novelty, has made our globe smaller and interdependent, to the extent that, even when one epidemic hits a small region, it can instantly affect the rest of the world, as was the case with the 2013\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in parts of West Africa. Ebola temporarily affected Europe (Spain and the UK), and the US. Thus, despite the controversy, global health has been an attractive theme in Africa and virtually all African leaders have endorsed the concept and its goals. However, experts must make it clear or define what they mean when they talk about global health. It stands to reason that an acceptable definition of global health must be found before we can recommend and apply common and unique evidence-based strategies, provide funds that are commensurate with the magnitude of the problems at hand, agree on the metrics that will allow us to evaluate the expected outcomes, and share, throughout these changes, the most effective approaches to gathering and delivering health information and the building of the most appropriate infrastructures for the globe.",

The secondary characteristics in the definition should contain the following: (1) source of obligation (to help those who do not have the means); (2) multidisciplinary approach (joint work of various disciplines and health professionals); (3) actors (individuals or groups as agents of global health); and (4) reactive/proactive measures and interventions (provision of global health). Yet, this heralded definition has been disliked by certain scholars who believe that insisting on the concept of equity or inequity as part of the definition is unjustified as it interjects ideology or opinion, expressed by one scholar as \u201cideological baggage,\u201d thus making it less attractive to those who try to be less intrusive in the objective discussion and provision of health. To this author and many others, the criticism seems paradoxical and misplaced. Eliminating inequalities (and unjustified disparities) has been one of the most important foci in public health literature endorsed by the UN and all its agencies for decades, including condemning unfair disparities which result in or perpetuate poverty and ill health as the cause or associated cause of many diseases and deaths. It is therefore a legitimate concern in all international pronouncements and strategies. The WHO has agreed on the following with the member nations:The poorest of the poor have high levels of illness and premature mortality. But poor health is not confined to those worst off. In countries at all levels of income, health and illness follow a social gradient: the lower the socioeconomic position, the worse the health. It does not have to be this way and it is not right that it should be like this. Where systematic differences in health are judged to be avoidable by reasonable action, they are, quite simply, unfair. It is this that we label health inequity. Putting right these inequities\u2014the huge and remediable differences in health between and within countries\u2014is a matter of social justice. Reducing health inequities is, for this WHO Commission of Social Determinants of Health, an ethical imperative. Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale (author\u2019s emphasis).

It is clear, for example, that no country in Africa can achieve the three health-related goals without an increased budget allocated to health, notwithstanding the fact that some 10 countries may have raised theirs from 4% to close to 15% as the Abuja Declaration prescribed. It is impossible for Africa to improve its health if it does not invest massively in the health infrastructure and in the training of a competent and sufficient health workforce.",

The awful condition of the health infrastructure (i.e., capable and sufficient number of hospitals and clinics to isolate and treat the infected persons), the lack of essential drugs, mobile units such as ambulances, health emergency gear, and sufficient trained health workers (nurses and doctors), proved that leaders in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and several West-Central African countries were absolutely unprepared for any unexpected or expected health emergencies, despite warnings emanating from previous outbreaks in the area. Undoubtedly, these countries endangered the health of the whole world, which, unfortunately, was not itself prepared to deal with a calamity of such magnitude. This was made worse by the fact that states began to quarrel about what quarantining someone meant, when quarantine should be used, and what the criteria were for the globe to apply when similar catastrophes occur\u2014at the time when even citizens and states in the most developed corners of the world began questioning the very idea of quarantining and isolating someone. In the US, the controversy ended up in a court of law, resulting in a victory of the nurse citizen who had worked in West Africa, while the rest of the country, including the supposedly \u201cinfallible,\u201d know-it-all Centre for Disease Control, led by Director Tom Frieden, and the National Institutes of Health, continued to squabble about what to do. Would the global community not be better served if there were serious sanctions against any country that accepts global responsibilities but does not follow them through? Should behavior that threatens the health of a country and the international community not be carefully scrutinized and be subject to accountability? Presently, for example, any country that does not achieve the eight MDGs suffers no consequences.",

With a population of more than 660 million, Sub-Saharan Africa would require approximately 1 million healthcare workers (including 700,000 physicians) to meet the MDGs and deliver basic healthcare services. The current capacity has been unfortunately neglected by governments, donors, agencies, and global health initiatives. (Cooper and Kirton 2013: 13; Sewankambo 2013: 159\u2013182)\n",

Paul Starr\u2019s criticism of an all-encompassing public health definition is not the only one leveled against the field and its practitioners. The frequent recalls of health products that are prematurely allowed in the community, and the tendency of public health to pose itself as a predicting science, rather than a field that is subject to the whims of individuals and populations\u2019 behaviors, and therefore not as solid as a natural science, are major pitfalls that make people distrust what epidemiologists, behaviorists, and nutritionists claim and \u201cpreach\u201d to be good for people. Indeed, no matter what theories public health practitioners may come up with, they are not always applicable to all individuals and all populations and must always be tailored to specific circumstances, and specific places and times, if possible, and to specific genetic make ups. Public health dilemmas were well expressed by Johnson in 2009 when he wrote that \u201cachieving public health outcomes for the society involves a contentious process of blending \u2018science, politics and activism,\u2019 resulting in battles fought along both political and behavioral lines\u201d (quote by Fayoyin 2014: 188).",

However, both are important concepts and goals and critical to the health of populations. Often, treatment or direct service has been viewed as a more critical task than preventive medicine or preventive health care, perhaps because it is more related to individuals and doctors who often receive more attention than populations. Prevention or preventive health care is antecedent to or the anticipatory step against disease occurrence or ill health if certain measures are not taken or behaviors are not dealt with seriously, and is often seen to be on a higher scale of impact as it aims to preserve the health of populations through what some colonialists in Africa termed \u201csocial prophylaxis.\u201d In the colonial battles against smallpox, jiggers, yaws, and sleeping sickness on the African continent, there was little distinction between the two, as colonial administrators and their physicians often \u201ctreated to prevent\u201d or \u201ctested and treated,\u201d without much considering the benefits of prevention. The ambiguity is carefully examined by Guillaume Lachenal, who calls it the \u201ctreat-and-treat strategies\u201d or the \u201ctest-and-treat paradigm\u201d in colonial Africa. Says Lachenal (2013: 84), \u201cFrom quinine to pentamidine, a constant ambiguity prevailed between individual prophylaxis and collective prevention through \u201ctest-and-treat\u201d strategies,\u201d when these were actually based \u201con fragile theories, hubristic hopes, na\u00efve faith in wonder drugs, and racial, and colonial paternalism, all of which will sound familiar to many global health practitioners who are aware of public health history.\u201d Indeed, treating may lead to prevention, as is the case with the HIV/AIDS where the most recent therapies do not only make the sick better but they also stop the easy transmission of the virus to others.",

Indeed, after each treatment, there is often the need for secondary and even tertiary prevention. In other words, this is often the case where the two go hand-in-hand. One thing is clear, though: When preventive steps are not taken, like cigarette smoking cessation, the disease outcome stage is costlier than when the smoker changes his behavior, which often results in no cancer or in a prolonged life span. However, an individual with genetic pre-disposition, at least for most major non-communicable diseases, may not benefit as much from preventive measures, at least at this stage of our public health and medical scientific advances. Unfortunately, even in developed countries, and more so, of course, in the developing nations, budgets for prevention are minimal\u2014they hover around 4\u20135% while the remainder goes to salaries, equipment procurement, maintenance of health facilities, and treatment. Studies by Weinstein Station conducted in 1976 and 1978 intimated that preventive measures that attempt to reduce the need for treatment against a heart attack, for example, through reduction of early death, may be, in the long run, more costly than the treatment itself, mainly as a result of drug costs. The same seems to be true of the efforts to prevent diabetes by decreasing high cholesterol: The cost is higher than the resulting heart disease treatment (see Okorafor 2010). This suggests that other factors than simple preventive care should be considered along those that might result in greater positive health outcomes.",

Thus, Physicians for Human Rights Tools and Resources (2010) were enraged when, in 2001, the highest ranking aid official in the Bush Administration, Andrew Natsios, advised, regarding AIDS, that Africa should only be given funding for prevention \u201cas treatment regimes were too complex for Africans who \u2018have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives.\u2019\u201d Such a policy stand is certainly a perversion of the emphasis on preventive care.

Unfortunately, at present, despite all financial assistance provided by the major external donors and funders, ECOSOC maintains that the gaps are still too many to make global health a reality, especially in health care systems (ECOSOC 2009: 22). For African institutions of higher learning, global health is considered by many to be another branch of public health. Despite its great appeal at our African institutions today, global health has its own potential negative side for Africa. Institutions with a global health program sometimes have avoided working directly with their African counterparts through African structures or bureaucracy and have tended to use \u201c[Western] American certified laboratories\u201d rather than those of the developing countries. Furthermore, by making itself different from public health, it appears that global health is moving toward providing resources to a smaller group of people and relegating supplies and treatment to private institutions. In the end, global health science carries with it a new set of inequalities, which in every case have favored the West and its institutional allies. As Crane puts it:It is not only African public health that is absent from global health experience\u2014it is also African expertise\u2026.In order to truly enact the ethic of partnership it espouses, global health science must account for the social relations of knowledge production it engenders. Moreover, it must strive to make these social relations of science more equitable just as it aims to make health more equitable. (Crane 2013: 180)\n",

We might conclude this discussion by echoing the words of Spielberg and Adams (2011: 5\u20136), when they wrote: \u201cThe primary aims of global health are to improve population health, reduce the existing disparities in the health between population groups, and protect populations from health threats\u2026A characteristic of global health is that its activities are best carried out in ways that are collaborative and cooperative, and involve multiple interested partners, often from a variety of disciplines\u201d (see also Farmer 2004).",
