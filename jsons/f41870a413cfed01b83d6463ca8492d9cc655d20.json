            "text": "The quantification of COVID-19 infection in CT images using deep learning has not been investigated. Clinically there is no automatic tool to quantify the infection volume for COVID-19 patients. Purpose: To develop a deep learning (DL)-based system for automatic segmentation and quantification of infection regions as well as the entire lung from chest CT scans. Materials and methods: The DL-based segmentation employs the \"VB-Net\" neural network to segment COVID-19 infection regions in CT scans. The system is trained using 249 COVID-19 patients, and validated using 300 new COVID-19 patients. To accelerate the manual delineation of CT images for training, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy is adopted to assist radiologists to refine automatic annotation of each case. To evaluate the performance of the DL-based system, Dice similarity coefficient, the differences of volume and percentage of infection (POI) are calculated between automatic and manual segmentation results on the validation set. Results: The proposed system yielded Dice similarity coefficients of 91.6%\u00b110.0% between automatic and manual segmentations, and a mean POI estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung on the validation dataset. Moreover, compared with the cases of fully manual delineation that often takes 1 to 5 hours, the proposed human-in-the-loop strategy can dramatically reduce the delineation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. Conclusion: A DL-based segmentation system was developed to automatically segment and quantify infection regions in CT scans of COVID-19 patients. Quantitative evaluation showed high accuracy for automatic infection region delineation, POI metrics.",

The infectious disease caused by this virus was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Feb 11, 2020 8 . To date (Mar 5 th 2020), there have been 80,565 confirmed cases in China and 95,333 confirmed cases all around the world 9 . Each suspected case needs to be confirmed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the sputum 10 . Although it is the gold standard for diagnosis, confirming COVID-19 patients using RT-PCR is time-consuming and has been reported to suffer from high false negative rates. On the other hand, because chest CT scans collected from COVID-19 patients frequently show bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity (GGO) in the lung 11, 12 , it has been used as an important complementary indicator in COVID-19 screening due to high sensitivity.",

Due to fast progression of the disease, subsequent CT scans every 3-5 days are recommended to evaluate the therapeutic responses. Although CT provides rich pathological information, only qualitative evaluation has been provided in the radiological reports owing to the lack of computerized tools to accurately quantify the infection regions and their longitudinal changes. Thus, subtle changes across follow-up CT scans are often ignored. Besides, contouring infection regions in the Chest CT is necessary for quantitative assessment; however, manual contouring of lung lesions is a tedious and time-consuming work, and inconsistent delineation could also lead to subsequent assessment discrepancies. Thus, a fast auto-contouring tool for COVID-19 infection is urgently needed in the onsite applications for quantitative disease assessment.",

In order to provide delineation for hundreds of the training COVID-19 CT images, which is a tedious and time-consuming work, we proposed a human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy to iteratively generate the training samples. This method involves radiologists to efficiently intervene DL-segmentation results and iteratively add more training samples to update the model, and thus greatly accelerates the algorithm development cycle.

Specifically, the training data were divided into several batches. First, the CT data in the smallest batch are manually contoured by radiologists. Then, the segmentation network was trained by this batch as an initial model. This initial model was applied to segment infection regions in the next batch, and radiologists manually correct the segmentation results provided by the segmentation network. These corrected segmentation results were then fed as new training data, and the model can be updated with increased training dataset. In this way, we iteratively increased the training dataset and built the final VB-Net. In the testing stage, the trained segmentation network segments the infection area on a new CT scan via a forward pass of neural network, and the HITL interaction also provides possible intervention and human-machine interaction for radiologists in clinical application. According to our experience, this HITL training strategy converged after 3~4 iterations. Figure  2 illustrates the process of the proposed HITL training strategy.",

With this deep learning system, the POIs of lung lobes and bronchopulmonary segments can be automatically calculated. Thus, statistics of infection distribution can be summarized in a large-scale dataset, e.g., 300 CT scans in our study. Figure 6 show the boxplots of these POIs calculated from 300 CT scans of COVID-19 patients in Shanghai district. Figure 6 (a) shows that the mean POIs of left and right lower lobes are higher than those of other lobes, which coincides with the findings reported in 23, 24 . Moreover, infection distribution can be analyzed further down to the bronchopulmonary segment level, as shown in Figure 6 (b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reveals the COVID-19 distribution in bronchopulmonary segments in terms of a largescale patient CT data. Our results show that the following segments are often infected by COVID-19 (listed with decreasing mean POI): right lower lobe -outer basal, right lower lobe -dorsal, right lower lobe -posterior basal, left lower lobe -outer basal, left lower lobe -dorsal, left lower lobe -posterior basal, and right upper lobe -back.",

Existing AI-based systems for automatic quantitative assessment always requires a large amount of annotation CT data, whereas collecting the annotated data is very expensive or even difficult. Moreover, these AI systems are always trained as a black box to users, who however always want to know what has happened behind the model. Our experimental results indicate that the HITL strategy makes the manual annotation process faster with the assistance of deep learning models. Also, the HITL strategy makes the system more comprehensible. That is, with manual intervention in HITL, the radiologists are aware of how good the system performs in the training process. Besides, the HITL strategy helps radiologists accustomed to the AI system because they are involved in the training process. It integrates the professional knowledge from radiologists in an interactive way.",

Second, the system is developed to quantify infections only, and it may not be applicable for quantifying other pneumonia, e.g., bacterial pneumonia.",
