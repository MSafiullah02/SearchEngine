            "text": "It is thought that A. albopictus was introduced in Europe in 1979 through Albania, by the trade of used tyres, although the first publication on its introduction in the European continent dates back to 1990 in Italy.8 Since then, A. albopictus has expanded throughout the Mediterranean area. In Spain, this aggressive mosquito is well established in Catalonia, Levante, in the coastal area of Murcia and Andalusia. It has also been detected in Guip\u00fazcoa,9 and little by little it is introduced in other non-coastal areas such as Aragon, extending through travel routes (for example, motorways).10 The last detection was carried out in the Community of Madrid11 (Fig. 1\n). A few months ago, the first specimens of this species were also identified in the North of Portugal. This mosquito has been incriminated as a vector of numerous arboviruses in different parts of the world, including Europe. A. albopictus, is the chikungunya virus vector. In this regard, most of the cases in Europe are imported, although in the last two decades there have been different epidemic outbreaks in Italy12 and, recently, in France.13 In Spain, only imported cases have been reported.14 This mosquito (next to Aedes aegypti which, as will be detailed later, has been detected in a timely manner in Europe) can act as a vector of the dengue virus and with less effectiveness of the Zika virus.15 In France, A. albopictus was responsible for the first autochthonous cases of dengue16 and of those reported in the same country during the following years, one of them with a history of travel to Madeira, where a large outbreak had been reported (more than a thousand cases) between 2012 and 2013.17 In 2011, the occurrence of autochthonous cases of dengue in Croatia were also attributed to A. albopictus, establishing the transmission by this mosquito in Europe.18 In Spain we are only suffering from their annoying bites, for now.19\n",

In Europe, after the eradication of malaria, most cases are imported, although sporadic cases have recently been reported in many Mediterranean countries such as France, Italy, Greece.24 The emergence of autochthonous cases in Greece between 2009 and 2017 has raised doubts about the real situation in Europe as a malaria-free zone.25\n",

The species Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus ariasi, are the competent vectors of the leishmaniasis agent (Leishmania infantum). There are also other potential vectors of L. infantum in Spain, as they are Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus sergenti. Leishmaniasis is endemic throughout the Mediterranean basin in Europe and its geographic scope is spreading. Usually, the epidemiology of leishmaniasis was linked to the rural habitat with the presence of dogs. The great epidemic outbreak of Fuenlabrada with a high number of cases in an urban area, in which leishmaniasis was not common, showed the dangers of changing the urban model in Spain. Many houses were built in rural agricultural areas with gardens and peri-urban green spaces where wildlife was present. In these places the concentration of phlebotominae sand flies was high, and, in their environment, there were not only dogs but also other L. infantum reservoirs, such as hares and rabbits. This fact together with mild temperatures in recent years, decreasing the mortality of the vector, seems to be what caused the great outbreak.26, 27, 28 Undoubtedly, the presence of phlebotominae sand flies throughout the Iberian Peninsula is a great threat, since not only do they transmit leishmania, but they are also Toscana virus vectors, which is causing numerous cases of meningoencephalitis in some areas of Spain29 and other phleboviruses such as the Granada virus (without proven pathogenic power), the Naples virus or the Sicily virus.30\n",

This species, which is distributed and well represented throughout the Iberian Peninsula, is capable of transmitting the West Nile virus (WNV). West Nile fever is becoming a serious problem in some areas of Europe, as in Greece, where there has been an outbreak with numerous neuroinvasive forms,31 and in 2017 cases have been reported in France, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia and Austria.32 In Spain, according to the data from the situation report and WNV risk assessment, published in 2013, there are several species of mosquitoes capable of virus transmission. For example, Culex modestus, Culex perexiguus and Culex theileri show a high vector competence, while C. pipiens and A. albopictus have a moderate vector competence.33 The first human case of neuroinvasive disease due to WNV in our country was identified, retrospectively, in a patient diagnosed with meningitis in September 2004 who, in the days before the onset of symptoms, visited a village in Badajoz, Extremadura (Spain).34 In 2010, the Ministry of the Environment reported the detection of WNV in 36 equine farms in the provinces of C\u00e1diz, Sevilla and M\u00e1laga.35 Through this active surveillance, 15 suspected cases were investigated and two human cases of WNV meningoencephalitis were confirmed.35 Between 2011 and 2016, virus activity was detected in equines, suggesting that the virus is endemic in our country.36 In addition, there was previous evidence about its circulation in birds that were considered for the development of a predictive virus circulation model in our country.37\n",

Just to mention an example, Ixodes ricinus, the tick that most frequently bites people in the north of Spain, is very sensitive to climate warming. This, among other factors, is increasing its survival.41 This species of tick transmits very prevalent diseases in Europe, such as Lyme disease or tick-borne encephalitis, or others such as Rickettsia monacensis infection, human anaplasmosis, and babesiosis.42, 43 In Spain, human cases of all of them have been described, except for tick-borne encephalitis. Although there is a high suspicion of the circulation of the virus in Spain, the molecular screening of hundreds of ticks has been carried out in our laboratory, with negative results.43 In addition, other pathogens have been detected in I. ricinus specimens collected in Spain, such as Rickettsia helvetica, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis or Borrelia miyamotoi, which leads us to be alert to the possible occurrence of human cases.44, 45, 46 As a consequence of climate change, the hypothesis about the probable changes in the distribution of another species of tick, Hyalomma marginatum, which is the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) vector in Europe, has also been established. Under warmer climate conditions, according to prediction models, it is expected that the distribution of this tick species will extend to new areas which were previously free of the vector. In relation to this issue, the epidemiology of Mediterranean spotted fever seems clearly associated with climate change, especially with low rainfall values47 and it has been shown that warming causes greater aggressiveness in its AVs. Table 4\nshows the tick-borne diseases throughout the world, with the prediction of risk for Spain (subjective assessments).",

Early detection and implementation of control strategies allow minimizing the impact on the population. Between 1990 and 2010, 91% of emerging infections spread from a wild-type focal point.2 Occasionally, the infection is spread directly from reservoirs such as bats, rats or chimpanzees to domestic animals, which amplify the infection, or to people; other times, infection dissemination (spill-over) occurs through AV such as ticks, fleas or mosquitoes. In any case, it is essential to carry out a surveillance and to know the microorganisms carried by AV. A recent example in Spain is the detection of CCHFV in ticks of the species Hyalomma lusitanicum collected in deer a few years ago48 in the province of Caceres and the explanation of one of the possible ways of the arrival of the virus to our country.49 Both findings contributed to the early detection of the disease that appeared in 2016 as, to some extent, it was predictable. On September 1, 2016, the Ministry of Health issued a press release reporting the death of a man by CCHF and the contagion of the nurse who had taken care of him in the ICU of the Vallecas Hospital where he had been treated. The first two autochthonous cases of CCHF in Spain were confirmed50 (Fig. 2\n). In the last CCHFV situation report and transmission risk assessment in Spain,51 the virus has been found in a low percentage of ticks of the species H. lusitanicum. This tick does not bite people very often and does not seem to be a good virus vector, although it shares an ecological niche with another very active species (H. marginatum) which bites humans more often. Given this situation, two scenarios could be developed: that of Turkey, where in 2002 the first case was reported and there are currently around 1,000 cases/year, or the scenario in Greece, where the first case was reported in 1975; the second, in 2008 and to date, no new cases have been reported.52\n",

In addition, this year the list is completed with disease X, referring to an international epidemic that could be caused by a pathogen whose pathogenic potential and route of transmission is unknown at the moment. This list takes into account the transmissibility between humans, the severity of cases and the percentage of mortality, the difficulty of control and diagnosis and the context of public health and global expansion. In addition, there are other diseases that need more attention as soon as possible: hemorrhagic fevers by other arenaviruses, chikungunya virus, diseases by other highly pathogenic coronaviruses or by emerging enteroviruses and febrile syndrome with severe thrombocytopenia.53 Many of these diseases are AV-borne.",

Body lice have been a serious public health problem until recently. They live in the seams of clothes and multiply in cold weather, lack of hygiene and war conditions. A person can be infested with thousands of lice, and each specimen is capable of biting an average of five times a day. It is said that body lice were one of the main problems during the Russian Revolution, where three million people affected by exanthematic typhus died. Thus, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870\u20131924) stated: Either Socialism defeats the louse, or the louse will defeat Socialism\u201d. Here in Spain, it was also a problem during the post-war period and was used as propaganda by Franco's regime. We can ask ourselves: Is there a risk of an epidemic or an epidemic outbreak of exanthematic typhus? It could happen, as it occurred in Burundi in 1996, when a large epidemic affected more than one hundred thousand patients.54 All the alarms went off when a Red Cross nurse was diagnosed after returning from work in the affected country. Body lice are not seen on the body surface but live in the seams of clothing, in 20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C temperatures. Parasitism by body lice should be suspected in persons with signs of scratching and lack of hygiene, more frequently in cold times of the year. At present, body lice have reappeared in refugee camps in Europe, as in the Second World War. In November 2015, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported the emergence of 27 cases of recurrent fever due to body lice at different points along the route followed by refugees arriving in Italy from the Syrian war.55 In Western Europe, although we have not experienced any epidemic since the post-war period, and the fact that the condition had been eradicated, occasionally, there are R. prowazekii and B. quintana infection reports in homeless people parasitized by lice56 and cases of Brill\u2013Zinsser disease have been described in people who have suffered from exanthematic typhus which could lead to an epidemic outbreak in certain conditions.57\n",

As far as we know, rickettsias are not transmitted by the human flea (Pulex irritans). In Europe, murine typhus is a common AVBD in Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Spain, including the Canary Islands.58 It develops as a non-specific febrile disease, with or without rash, which is often underdiagnosed. In clinical practice, murine typhus should be included in the differential diagnosis of any patient with fever of intermediate duration, that is, in a patient with fever (more than 38 \u00b0C) of more than 7 and less than 28 days of progression, without focality to guide the diagnosis, which remains without a diagnosis after an initial evaluation that includes a complete clinical history, physical examination, complete blood count, chest X-ray and biochemical blood and urine tests.59\nR. felis infection is another rickettsiosis with characteristics similar to murine typhus, of which cases have also been published in Spain60 and that should be considered in patients with fever and/or rash, with a history of contact with cats or flea bites. Despite the fact that there have been no reports of autochthonous Yersinia pestis infection transmitted by the rat flea (X. cheopis) in Spain, there is an alert for travellers at the time of writing this manuscript due to an epidemic outbreak in Madagascar that has affected several thousand people.5\n",

The human tampering of ecosystems (deforestation, erosion of geographical limits to facilitate travel, etc.) or climate change are some of the factors that are favouring a greater contact between wild animals (with their ticks and the diseases they transmit) and people, facilitating the expansion of ticks to new previously unoccupied areas. Diptera, ticks or other AV may play the leading role in the next pandemic. Therefore, anticipating the next Public Health crisis is in our hands.",
