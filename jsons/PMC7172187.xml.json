A typical feature of many infectious and non-infectious diseases, the aetiological diagnosis of fever poses a considerable challenge for health professionals and surveillance systems, especially when confirmatory tests are not available at point-of-care [2]. Environmental conditions, socio-economic factors and availability of vaccines are some of the factors influencing the incidence and aetiology of infectious febrile illness in the region.",

The progression from malaria to non-malaria febrile illness (NMFI) has shaped the fever epidemiology landscape and exposed new challenges for management and control in the region [5]. Hence, identifying the causes of NMFI is of paramount importance for improving patient care, for more efficient surveillance systems that include detection of emerging pathogens, and to guide implementation of diagnostic and preventive tools.",

Among these, dengue virus (DENV) has recently shown an expanding geographic range, moving from urban to rural areas, with efforts to control Aedes aegypti being largely unsuccessful [7]. The recent introduction into Latin America of zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which share many epidemiological and clinical features with DENV, highlights the lack of preparedness of local health systems to promptly and accurately ascertain the aetiology of AFI, resulting in inadequate management of and delayed responses to epidemics.",

From a clinical perspective, there is no clinical algorithm robust enough to distinguish between these three arboviruses. Clinical guidelines in Latin America recommend patients to be managed in the initial phase as DENV, as lack of early intervention can result in high rates of complications. Point-of-care diagnostics are of limited value, due to low sensitivity for some of the serotypes, while serology interpretation is challenged by previous exposure to DENV and other flaviviruses.",
