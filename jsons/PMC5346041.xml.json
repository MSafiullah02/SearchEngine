This review will focus on the PRRs that sense viral nucleic acid PAMPs within the cytosol of the cell generated during RNA and DNA virus infection. We will describe how the cytosolic nucleic acid sensing PRRs, the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and DNA sensors, discriminate between self and non-self to activate antiviral immune responses (Figure 1\n).",

            "text": "RIG-I senses a number of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, alphaviruses, coronaviruses, reoviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses [9, 10]. RIG-I recognizes PAMPs, including short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) containing either a 5\u2032 triphosphate or 5\u2032 diphosphate moiety that are generally unique to viral RNA [11, 12, 13\u2022]. Interestingly, a recent report identified RIG-I as a PRR for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), whose RNA genome is 5\u2032-monophosphorylated, implicating an additional ability of RIG-I to sense 5\u2032-monophosphate-containing viral RNAs [14\u2022]. Therefore, while canonical ligands of RIG-I have been identified, future research may uncover additional features of ligands, such as post-transcriptional RNA modifications, that allow RIG-I to distinguish self from non-self. Indeed, self-RNAs are distinguished from foreign RNAs by post-transcriptional modifications of their 5\u2032 triphosphate ends, which contain the RNA cap structures. These include cap0: 7-methylguanosine addition to the gamma phosphate on the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs; cap1: identical to cap0, with 2\u2032-O-methylation of the first nucleotide following the 5\u2032 triphosphate; and cap2: identical to cap1, with an additional 2\u2032-O-methyl group on the second nucleotide. The 2\u2032-O-methylation present in cap1 is crucial for avoiding recognition by RIG-I [15\u2022\u2022, 16\u2022\u2022]. In addition, 2\u2032-O-methylation protects host mRNAs from sequestration by IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs), which would otherwise inhibit the translation of these proteins [17]. In fact, certain viruses including flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and alphaviruses have co-opted cellular RNA capping strategies, likely to evade detection by RLRs [18, 19].",

            "text": "RIG-I contains several functional domains that regulate sensing of PAMPs and its subsequent activation. It is comprised of two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), followed by two tandem helicase domains (Hel1, Hel2) separated by an insertion domain (Hel2i), as well as a C-terminal repressor domain (RD) [11, 20, 21]. In resting cells, Hel2i interacts with the second CARD, keeping RIG-I in an auto-inhibited state [22, 23]. The RD inhibits self-association of RIG-I, preventing its interaction with MAVS [20]. Upon sensing viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change, in which the RD interacts with viral RNA and the helicase domains, breaking the interaction of Hel2i with the second CARD to release the CARDs for interaction with MAVS, which also contains a CARD motif [21, 22]. Following this conformational change, both the RD and CARDs are subject to post-translational modifications (PTMs). First, the RD of RIG-I is subject to Lysine (K) 63-linked poly-ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RIPLET [24, 25]. This promotes tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) K63-linked ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs [26]. Mex-3 RNA Binding Family Member C (MEX3C) was recently identified as an additional essential E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates K63-linked ubiquitination on RIG-I CARDs [27], and TRIM4 was found to enhance RIG-I signaling via K63-linked ubiquitination that is redundant with TRIM25 and RIPLET [28]. Recent structural work has demonstrated that K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I stabilizes assembly of its CARDs into a helical tetramer. This tetramer of RIG-I CARDs facilitates interaction with MAVS, and nucleates MAVS filament formation [29]. Removal of specific PTMs, including lysine acetylation by histone deactylase 6 (HDAC6) and dephosphorylation of RIG-I CARDs by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is required for full RIG-I activation [30, 31, 32]. In addition to regulation by its structure and by PTMs, RIG-I is regulated at the cell biological level. In resting cells, RIG-I is localized to the cytoplasm where it can detect PAMPs of invading viruses. However, upon activation, RIG-I interacts with various proteins, including TRIM25 and 14-3-3\u025b, to form a translocon that facilitates RIG-I re-localization into intracellular membranes for interaction with MAVS [33, 34]. Taken together, these complex regulatory mechanisms prevent aberrant activation of RIG-I.",

            "text": "While some overlap exists between the viruses sensed by RIG-I and MDA5 \u2014 such as flaviviruses, alphaviruses, coronaviruses, reoviruses, and paramyxoviruses \u2014 MDA5 plays an indispensable role in detection of picornaviruses and caliciviruses [35]. MDA5 has similar structural domains to RIG-I (CARDs-helicases-RD) and also signals downstream through MAVS. However, MDA5 senses long dsRNA, which are viral replication intermediates [36, 37]. Similar to RIG-I, 2\u2032-O-methylation at the 5\u2032 end of RNAs prevents MDA5 sensing [38]. While RIG-I recognizes the terminal end of dsRNA, MDA5 recognizes the internal duplex structure of dsRNA in a length-dependent fashion [37]. The crystal structure of MDA5 bound to dsRNA reveals that MDA5 stacks along dsRNA, forming filamentous structures, in a head-to-tail arrangement for signaling [39]. The ATP hydrolysis activity of the helicase domains is required for MDA5 filament formation [39, 40]. These filaments expose the CARDs of MDA5 for interaction with the CARD motif of MAVS [39]. PTMs also regulate MDA5 function. Like RIG-I, PP1 dephosphorylates MDA5 CARDs, leading to MDA5 activation [32]. However, unlike RIG-I, little is known about other PTMs that may regulate MDA5 activation, such as K63-linked ubiquitination [3]. In addition, little is known about the cell biology that regulates MDA5 activation. Future studies to address these aspects of the regulation of MDA5 will be of interest.",

LGP2 has similar domains to RIG-I and MDA5 (Helicase-RD), however it lacks the N-terminal CARDs required for interaction with MAVS. While it has been shown that LGP2 recognizes both dsRNA and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), with a preference for RNA with a 5\u2032 triphosphate, LGP2 is not able to independently activate downstream signaling to MAVS because it lacks N-terminal CARDs required for this interaction. In addition, multiple conflicting functions have been attributed to LGP2, including negative regulation of RIG-I [41, 42], as well as negative regulation of MDA5 [45], and positive regulation of MDA5 [43\u2022, 45]. Recently, LGP2 was found to regulate the binding of MDA5 to RNA and regulate MDA5 filament assembly for enhanced signaling activity [43\u2022]. Therefore, it seems LGP2 may serve multiple, diverse functions in response to different viruses. Further research will be required to appreciate the role and function of LGP2 in regulation of RNA virus sensing and downstream signaling.",

While cGAS was only recently identified, it is already recognized as the primary cytosolic DNA sensor. Indeed, recent reports suggest that cGAS may mediate the ability of other DNA sensors to activate STING and the ISD pathway [57\u2022]. cGAS senses DNA viruses such as herpesviruses, human papillomavirus, adenovirus, and hepatitis B virus, as well as retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus, and murine leukemia virus [58, 59]. Additionally, cGAS plays a role in the innate immune response to a number of positive-sense RNA viruses, although it is not known whether cGAS can act as a true RNA sensor [60, 61].",

            "text": "Structural studies on cGAS have provided important insights into how it recognizes DNA and synthesizes the second messenger cGAMP. cGAS is composed of an N-terminal unstructured region, followed by a nucleotidyl transferase domain, and a C-terminal male abnormal 21 domain [55]. Resting cGAS exists in a bilobal conformation, with a zinc thumb located between the lobes. cGAS binds to dsDNA via this zinc thumb, which induces a conformational change in cGAS. The catalytic pocket of cGAS is then accessible for synthesis of cGAMP [59, 62, 63]. This synthesis generates 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, an endogenous cGAMP, which contains two unique phosphodiester bonds [59, 64, 65, 66]. Interestingly, 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP binds STING with much higher affinity than cGAMP molecules with different phosphodiester linkages, demonstrating the importance of the specific product of cGAS to activate innate immunity [66]. This production of cGAMP is essential for STING activation by cGAS, as catalytically inactive cGAS does not induce type I IFN, despite its ability to bind DNA [55]. cGAMP activates STING by inducing a conformational change after which STING dimerizes and is subject to K63-linked ubiquitination by TRIM56 and TRIM32 [67, 68]. Further mechanisms governing cGAS activity, such as regulation by other PTMs, remain uncharacterized. Given its widespread or ubiquitous expression and the requirement of cGAS in the ISD pathway, future studies to uncover these regulatory mechanisms will be of importance.",

A recent study used in vitro pull-down assays to show that DAI binds to DNA in a sequence-independent, but length-dependent manner [74]. Interestingly, this study also shows that DNA may serve as a scaffold upon which DAI can aggregate and that artificial dimerization of DAI induced type I IFN expression in the absence of DNA, suggesting that dimerization or oligomerization of DAI drives downstream signaling [74]. Further research will be required to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which DAI senses DNA. While STING is known as the major adaptor protein in DNA sensing pathways, it has not been clearly demonstrated that DAI signals through STING [75]. Though DAI may be dispensable for the innate immune response to viral DNA, future efforts should focus on dissecting the DAI pathway, given its possible roles in cell type-specific antiviral responses, and its contribution to autoimmune diseases.",

They are also known to be required for inflammasome activation in response to multiple pathogens [78, 79, 80]. The inflammasome is an inflammatory response induced following transcriptional activation of caspase-1, which then cleaves IL-1 cytokines into IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to promote inflammation [81]. The ALR family consists of five members in humans: absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), pyrin and HIN domain family member 1 (PYHIN1), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), and pyrin domain-only protein 3 (POP3). AIM2 and IFI16 are the two most prominent members of the ALR family and are members of the pyrin and HIN domain (PYHIN) family. Both AIM2 and IFI16 have been shown to be required for inflammasome activation after DNA virus sensing. AIM2 activates inflammasomes in response to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), vaccinia virus, and mouse cytomegalovirus [80], and IFI16 activates inflammasomes in response to HSV-1 [82].",

Depletion of IFI16 has been shown to dampen the IFN response to viruses such as the retrovirus HIV-1, HSV-1, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [83, 84, 85]. While these studies have implicated IFI16 as an important sensor of both cytosolic and nuclear foreign DNA, a recent study demonstrated that in mice, ALRs are not required for the ISD response [86\u2022\u2022]. Further, by using genetic knockouts, human IFI16 was shown to be non-essential for the IFN response to HCMV infection. Alternatively, cGAS was essential for the ISD response in both mice and human cells [86\u2022\u2022]. Thus, similar to DAI, ALRs such as IFI16 either serve a cell type-specific role in initiating the ISD pathway, or have a redundant role with other factors. These recent findings highlight the uncertainty surrounding many putative DNA sensors, and the clear requirement of the recently discovered cGAS as the PRR of the ISD pathway.",

Following RIG-I sensing of short dsRNA, this sensor is further activated through K63-linked ubiquitination by TRIM25 and RIPLET, as well as through lysine deacetylation by HDAC6. Following sensing of long dsRNA, MDA5 oligomerizes along the dsRNA. Both RIG-I and MDA5 activate signaling through the adaptor MAVS located on mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated ER membranes (MAM), and peroxisomes (perox.), leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB and the production of type I IFN and ISGs. Viral DNA PAMPs are sensed by cGAS which catalyzes the production of cGAMP after binding to DNA. cGAMP then signals through the adaptor STING, located on ER membranes to activate IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. Other viral DNA sensors in the cytosol such as DAI and IFI16 are also postulated to function through this pathway. Activation of IFI16 or AIM2 following viral DNA detection leads to inflammasome activation.",
