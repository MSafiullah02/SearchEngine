Social and sexual networking apps have long been used by GBQT2+ to seek social connections, either virtually or in-person.

For example, compared with the previous month, Tinder has seen an increase of up to 15% on their apps in the United States and up to 25% in Italy and Spain.

For instance, the Hassle Free Clinic, a Toronto STI and HIV testing clinic provides services to GBQT2+ clients, has significantly reduced hours, removed clinic drop-in services, and stopped providing routine STI/HIV testing amid the pandemic [15] . Additional community-based resources providing mental and sexual health-related services to GBQT2+ have significantly limited available resources or suspended programming, including STI/HIV testing, low-cost counselling services, mental health support groups, and walk-in health services [16] [17] [18] . Across British Columbia, as a part of cancelling all non-emergency surgeries, gender affirming surgeries have largely been cancelled or postponed indefinitely [19] .

This included paid advertising and boosted posts on Facebook and Instagram for CBRC and partners who have a large social media presence. Additionally, several community champions and local celebrity drag queens promoted the survey on their social media profiles and were provided with a small honorarium as compensation for their time. Finally, CBRC purchased recruitment ads on popular sex seeking apps and websites (Grindr, Squirt, Scruff, Jack'd), porn sites (PornHub), and GBTQ2-oriented media sites (Xtra, Fugues). The eligibility criteria restricted participation to individuals who identified as men or another gender other than women (e.g., non-binary, genderqueer, agender; inclusive of trans men and Two-Spirit people); identified as gay, bisexual, queer, asexual, or other non-heterosexual identity (inclusive of Two-Spirit) and/or have reported having had sex with another man in the last 5 years; were at least 15 years of age; lived in Canada; provided informed consent; completed a questionnaire in either French or English; and did not already participate in this study cycle.

In fact, among 6198 GBQT2+ who participated in the 2019 Sex Now Survey, over one-in-five GBQT2+ (21%) had Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item [22; PHQ-2] depression scores greater than clinical screening thresholds and 29% self-reported having \"Fair\" or \"Poor\" mental health overall. Further, a staggering 57% of respondents wanted help with a mental health problem they were facing. Notably, of those who wanted help with a mental health problem, 19% wanted help dealing with suicidal thoughts. These statistics are alarming considering that we also see a dose-response relationship between the number of people GBQT2+ can turn to for support and the proportion who have depression symptoms and the proportion who want help dealing with suicidal thoughts. If social distancing prevents people from accessing these supports, it may contribute to worse mental health outcomes, potentially even suicide. In addition to the effects on social distancing, economic impacts may also harm GBQT2+ and their mental health. In Sex Now 2019, only one third (33%) of GBQT2+ reported having \"extra\" money and 10% reported not being able to \"make ends meet.\" Recent national research in Canada highlighted that half of LGBTQ2+ households (52%, compared with 39% of households overall) have experienced lay-offs or reduced employment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [23] .",

While some people, including GBQT2+, will undoubtedly continue to connect in-person with sexual partners during the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that the apps and websites are also used for online sexual acts. With 32% of GBQT2+ reporting camming or sexting online-it would suggest that at least some GBQT2+ may be able to find safe ways to fulfill their sexual needs while social distancing.

Beyond issues of delayed or missed diagnoses of STIs, especially asymptomatic ones, a lack of STI screening also means that clinical eligibility for PrEP [24] will be limited if rectal STIs or syphilis are not diagnosed. Regarding PrEP, 86% of HIV-negative GBQT2+ on PrEP reported daily use. Fortunately, if access to PrEP is made difficult by increased burden on the healthcare system or if individuals are worried about accessing health services to get their prescription fulfilled these individuals might be able to switch to on demand regimens (only 11% were currently taking it on demand), but this may not provide adequate HIV prevention during sex if sexual frequency is very low. Issues with antiretroviral adherence for people living with HIV may also be impacted by a lack of physical access to healthcare providers and peer navigators [25] . In Sex Now, there were already indications of sub-optimal adherence among people living with HIV: 33% reported having missed a dose in the past 4 weeks alone. Disruptions to regular habits and schedules as well as potential challenges to medication access could compound these problems.",
