Within the IgG antibodies, preferential transport of IgG isotype 1 is noted, leading to a more efficient transport of antibodies elicited by vaccines containing protein antigens compared with vaccines containing polysaccharide antigens (eliciting IgG2 isotype antibodies) [5] . Some chronic maternal infections like malaria and HIV can cause an impaired transplacental transport [6, 7] .",

In 1988, the WHO estimated that 787,000 newborns died due to neonatal tetanus corresponding with a global incidence of approximately 6.7 deaths per 1000 live births. In low-and middleincome countries, the overall incidence was even higher with 50 to 110 deaths per 1000 live births due to neonatal tetanus [20, 22] . Therefore, the World Health Assembly launched the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Program (MNTE) in 1989. The goal of this program is to eliminate MNT through the promotion of birth hygiene, surveillance and maternal immunization with tetanus toxoid. WHO recommends that unimmunized pregnant women or pregnant women without documentation of previous tetanus vaccination should receive two doses of tetanus toxoid (TT) at least 4 weeks apart. The first dose should be given as early as possible during pregnancy and the last dose should be given at least 2 weeks prior to delivery. A total of 5 doses are considered sufficient for life-long immunity so further doses should be given during subsequent pregnancies or at intervals of at least 1 year [23].",

During recent years, some countries with high vaccination coverage experienced a rise in the incidence of pertussis with the highest incidence, disease burden and case fatality rate in infants below 1 year of age. These infants are too young to be protected by the currently available vaccines and vaccination schedules since infant pertussis vaccination does not start before the age of 6 weeks, resulting in a susceptibility gap for pertussis infection in infants [28] . As a result of the resurgence of pertussis disease and to better protect these vulnerable infants, national advisory bodies from both industrialized and developing countries have recommended immunization with a tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (aP) (Tdap) vaccine for all pregnant women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy [29, 30] . Many studies have reported the safety of maternal Tdap vaccination concluding that the current strategy of maternal pertussis vaccination is a safe strategy for mother, fetus and infant [31, 32] .",

Vaccinating pregnant women with an aP-containing vaccine induces similar humoral immune responses compared with non-pregnant women [33, 34] . Overall, pertussis-specific antibodies wane quite rapidly with already a significant decline in antibody titers 1 year after maternal Tdap vaccination [34, 35] . This observation supports the recommendation for repeated booster vaccinations in successive pregnancies. In the case of cellular immune responses, maternal Tdap vaccination stimulates significantly weaker proliferative and IFN-\u03b3 responses in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women [34] , but the vaccination is still immunogenic and induces a sufficient amount of maternal antibodies in women. These antibodies can be transported actively across the placenta to the fetus to protect the offspring in the first weeks of life. Recent studies show that maternal Tdap vaccination, administered in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, prevents pertussis in at least 9 out of 10 infants below 6 months of age [36] [37] [38] .",

However, recent data show that vaccination earlier in pregnancy, even second rather than third trimester vaccination, is the best option since this timing offers the necessary time to develop and transport maternal antibodies towards the unborn child. An Australian study reported higher pertussis-specific antibody titers in cord blood of infants born to women immunized at 28-32 weeks of gestation compared with women immunized between 33 and 36 weeks of gestation suggesting that vaccination earlier in the third trimester is more effective than later in pregnancy [40] . More recently, a Swiss study found that second trimester immunization was associated with significantly higher titers in cord blood of term born infants compared with third trimester immunization [41]. The same effect was seen in the cord of preterm born infants, even when they were born before 33 weeks of gestation [11], a time point where transplacental transport is considered to be suboptimal.",

In the 1990s, blunting of naturally acquired maternal pertussis antibodies with the infant's humoral immune response to whole cell pertussis (wP), yet not to aP vaccines, was already described [42] . On the other hand, it has been shown that the presence of vaccine-induced passive maternal antibodies may blunt the infant immune response to childhood aP vaccination. However, this interference effect is highly variable for different aP-containing vaccines and even in different studies on the same aP-containing vaccine [2, 14, 33, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . More recently, also blunting of the infant immune response to childhood wP-containing vaccines in the presence of vaccine-induced maternal antibodies has been shown [48] . Besides blunting of the infant humoral immune responses to the same vaccine antigens as the ones included in the Tdap vaccine, also blunting of vaccine antigens conjugated to the diphtheria toxoid variant (CRM) or TT has also been demonstrated, for example, blunting of the pneumococcal immune response, mainly after primary immunization [47, 49] . Up until now, no clinical evidence of blunting has been shown [50] . But, ongoing surveillance in older, vaccinated infants and toddlers is still essential to understand the longer-term impact and possible significance of these immunological findings.",

Pregnant women are at increased risk of influenzaassociated complications and are recognized as a priority group for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination. During recent seasonal influenza episodes, pregnant women had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization [51] compared with non-pregnant women. The disease severity increased with each trimester and was the highest for pregnant women with medical co-morbidities, e.g. metabolic disorders and chronic lung diseases [52] . Besides, influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and small for gestational age for infants [53, 54] . Additionally, infants under 6 months of age are at high risk of severe influenza and associated complications with high rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations and even mortality [55] . However, currently, there is no influenza vaccine approved in any country for use in infants below 6 months of age. So, protection of infants during the first months of life can only be achieved by influenza vaccination during pregnancy [56] . Several national and international institutions, e.g. the WHO and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recommend that every pregnant women should be vaccinated with one dose of an inactivated influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy before the start of the flu season [57, 58] . In 2012, the WHO stated that pregnant women should be prioritized above other groups for influenza vaccination in countries considering the initiation or expansion of their programs for seasonal influenza vaccination [59] .",

On the other hand, vaccinating earlier in pregnancy will provide protection against influenza during a longer proportion of the pregnancy, which is beneficial for the pregnant women, but may increase the probability that protection does not last until delivery and that consequently protection is not transferred to the offspring [66] . Additionally, safety data on influenza vaccination during the first trimester of pregnancy are lacking.",

The duration of passive protection against influenza in the infants depends on the maternal level of antibodies, the amount of antibodies transferred from mother to infant and on how quickly these passively acquired antibodies wane during the first months of life. Studies in South Africa and Bangladesh describe a half-life of vaccine-induced maternal influenza antibodies in the infant of 42-50 days corresponding with a protection of approximately 2-3 months [64, 65] .",

Of the more than 30 million RSV childhood cases worldwide, the disease causes 1.4 million hospitalizations in the first year of life and 120,000 deaths before 5 years of age each year [69] . Currently, vaccination of pregnant women is considered as the most plausible strategy to protect these infants against RSV. Several maternal vaccines are currently under various stages of development and could be available within a few years [70] . One of these vaccines, the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (Novavax\u00ae), was already tested in 4636 pregnant women in an international phase 3 clinical trial. Despite the fact that the primary outcomes of the study were not met, the candidate vaccine showed no significant safety issues in pregnant women and their offspring, a good immunogenicity and seroresponse rate in pregnant women, an efficient transplacental antibody transfer with high concentrations of RSV antibodies in the infants at birth and a progressively greater efficacy against severe outcomes of RSV infection in young infants [71] .",
