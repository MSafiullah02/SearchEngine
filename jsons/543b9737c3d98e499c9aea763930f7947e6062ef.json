However, being exposed to something that is important to one's self-esteem can provide relief to mortality threats (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1999) .

To boost the manipulation, they were asked to write a short paragraph on how they were living this situation. Following this, we used 2 items: \"I'm feeling my life is threatened\" and I'm thinking about death\" to measure mortality threat (our first moderator). A principal component analysis reveals that the scale is unidimensional, and it shows a high level of reliability (\uf061\uf03d\uf02e72). Afterwards, participants were reminded that due to the social distance policies, which prevents tourists from visiting museums, some of them were offering virtual tours. Hence, they were randomly assigned to one of the virtual tours (interactive, control A, control B).",

In line with this, our paper merges two literature streams: that of innovation in the tourism industry and Terror Management Theory in psychology. While there is some research combining these two streams (Oren, Shani, & Poria, 2019; Ulqinaku & Sarial-Abi, 2020) , research is still unclear on what could be the results of the threatened consumers on tourism. We contribute to these streams of research by shading some light into how tourist practitioners can address changing needs of consumers that are now overwhelmed by reminders of death and, hence, with mortality salient. In this research, we offer for a deeper understanding and quick response that can offer help to tourism during the COVID-19 lockdown. Empirically, the paper adopts an experimental approach with between-subjects design in the tourism context, which provides solid and rational grounds for assuming a causal effect (Viglia & Dolnicar, 2020) between the type of virtual tours in tourism and attitudes of tourists.",

While we hope that these events do not happen in the future, people can be reminded of fear of death in numerous situations, by reading the newspaper, by watching the news, or simply by reading a book or watching a money where the main character dies. Given that mortality salience can affect such a broad array of human behavior, and it can also affect consumer behavior, we believe that it is important to extend this in tourism, offering some initial insights on their relationship and calling for future research on these topics.",
