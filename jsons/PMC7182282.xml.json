On March 27, MoH made official (Note n\u00ba 5/2020-DAF/SCTIE/MS \n21\n ) the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients with severe forms of COVID-19 \n22\n\n-\n\n27\n . The proposed protocol consists of treatment over five days, however these two drugs should be used as a complementary measure to all other types of treatment support used, such as mechanical ventilation and symptomatic medications, as well as others provided in the treatment manual \n21\n . Two national clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the CQ use as treatment for COVID-19 infection were approved by the national research ethics committee (CONEP) \n28\n .",
