As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.",

However, for this to occur there are a number of hurdles that the virus would need to overcome to infect a novel wildlife host. Here, we propose a plausible mechanism where SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the disease COVID-19, could spillover from infected humans into novel wildlife hosts in North America. We developed a conceptual model for this hypothesized mechanism (Fig. 1) , which we outlined as five premises supported from the existing literature on shedding of coronaviruses by humans, survivability of these viruses, and documented pathways for movement of coronaviruses into the natural environment.",

            "text": "For our conceptual model to be plausible, we assume that coronaviruses can be shed in the feces of infected humans. This assumption has been supported by research on other coronaviruses (Yeo et al. 2020) . For example, MERS coronavirus was detected in 14.6% and 2.4% of fecal and urine samples, respectively, from 37 infected individuals (Corman et al. 2015) , while SARS CoV was shed in the feces of 56 infected individuals for a median of 27 days, with 4 individuals shedding for over 100 days (Liu et al. 2004 ). In addition, 38.4% of SARS-infected patients experienced diarrhea, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in 16\u250073% of the stool samples, and cultured from the small intestines of 5 patients (Leung et al. 2003 , Yeo et al. 2020 ). In addition, SARS-CoV remained infectious in diarrheal fecal samples at room temperature for up to 4 days (Lai et al. 2005) . More recently, a U. S. patient with COVID-19 also shed SARS-CoV-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 59% of 96 infected patients for up to 31 days (Zheng et al. 2020 ). Thus, a portion of infected humans are capable of shedding novel coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in their feces, with some for extended (1-4 months) periods. Although there is uncertainty whether SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in feces, similar coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, are infectious in feces, and ACE2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2, are abundant in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia cells in humans (Xiao et al. 2020) . This, coupled with the positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from feces in a large portion of infected patients (Wu et al. 2020b , Xiao et al. 2020 , Zheng et al. 2020 suggests that infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are secreted from gastrointestinal cells into feces (Xiao et al. 2020 ).",

In general, the transit time for sewage to reach a WWTP is less than one day (Wigginton et al. 2015) . While WWTP do reduce virus levels, infective virus is still detected in the effluent from these plants (Wigginton et al. 2015) . Based on metagenomics, coronaviruses were detected in 80% of the samples from effluent class B sewage sludge from 5 WWTP in the U.S., which is typically applied to agricultural lands as a soil amendment (Bibby and Peccia 2013) . Although data is lacking for coronaviruses, wastewater treatment prior to disinfection results in 0\u25002 log 10 reduction of infective enteroviruses and 2 \u2500 >3-log reduction of infective adenoviruses, with infectious virus still being detected in the final effluent from the waste treatment process released into the environment (Simmons and Xagoraraki 2011, Wigginton et al. 2015) . Thus, there is evidence that infectious coronaviruses could pass through the wastewater treatment process and enter natural aquatic systems via WWTP (pathway 3 in Fig. 1 ).",

In addition, coronaviruses have been detected in feces of North American bats with viral RNA prevalence in shed feces of 17-50%, depending on the species of bat (Dominguez et al. 2007 ). Other North American wildlife strongly associated with aquatic environments are raccoons (Procyon lotor), which have also been infected with coronaviruses (Martin and Zeidner 1992) . Interestingly, raccoons also feed on aquatic organisms, such as mollusks, that are also potential candidates to bioaccumulate viruses. where they increased their foraging activity downstream from WWTP relative to upstream (Vaughan et al. 1996 , Abbott et al. 2009 ). This suggests a potential pathway for bats to become infected with HCoV, and presumably SARS-CoV-2, from water sources contaminated with these pathogens from WWTP.",

Because domestic cats can efficiently replicate SARS-CoV-2 and transmit the virus to na\u00efve cats , domestic cats represent another mechanism for spillover transmission from wild cats to humans. Another risk associated with the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in a wildlife host population is the potential for mutation in novel hosts that results in a variant virus (Menachery et al. 2017) . Of particular concern, is whether there is the potential for recombination of SARS-CoV-2 with other bat coronaviruses should spillover of SARS-CoV-2 occur in bat populations.",

In addition, we posit that spillback of novel coronaviruses from the new wildlife hosts is also possible. Thus, considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater treatment plants and their surrounding environments should come under increased scrutiny for serving as a potential areas where spillover into wildlife hosts could occur. This was recently conducted in the Netherlands where SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in sewage from WWTPs servicing 6 cities and an airport (Medema et al. 2020) . Such scrutiny could integrate surveillance of key wildlife species, such as bats and raccoons, which have the potential for acquiring coronaviruses from their aquatic environments. An enhanced surveillance program of identifying SARS-CoV-2 spillover into wildlife would ideally involve 1) identifying \"hotspot\" municipalities with high human caseloads of COVID-19, 2) identifying areas downstream from WWTP effluent releases, and 3) sampling target wildlife species, such as bats, mustelids, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 raccoons, for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and viral presence. Such an effort could be conducted in conjunction with sampling WWTP effluent as proposed by Medema et al. (2020) .",

            "text": "they operated efficiently, there are numerous opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the aquatic environment through periodic accidental spills of untreated waste from WWTPs. There are two types of WWTP systems in the U. S. Combined sewer systems (CSS) are the earliest WWTP constructed and collect sewage and storm water runoff through a single pipe system while sanitary sewer systems (SSS) are newer and are separate from municipal storm water systems (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2004). Of the 14,194 WWTP in the U.S., 65.8% are which are responsible for 850 billion gallons of untreated waste being accidentally released each year; SSS are responsible for 3-10 billion gallons of spills each year (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2004). Often, these spills coincide with extreme events, such as severe storms. For example, 11 billion gallons of untreated (31.3%) and partially treated (68.7%) sewage was released from WWTP into rivers and canals from during Hurricane Sandy, mostly in New York City and northern New Jersey (Kenward et al. 2013). Both of these areas are currently experiencing massive COVID-19 outbreaks. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been large sewage spills in outbreak areas. For example in February-March 2020, 16.1 million gallons of sewage spilled in two separate accidents near Atlanta, Georgia (Kelly 2020) and 211 million gallons of sewage was released in multiple accidents near Fort Lauderdale, Florida (Brasileiro 2020). Thus, accidental releases of untreated sewage into the environment is an additional mechanism whereby infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be released into nearby waterways5. Bats and other wildlife become infected with coronavirus by drinking contaminated water in the natural environmentAlthough coronaviruses are assumed to lose infectivity in aquatic environments because of their lipid envelopes, the time for these viruses to reach 90% inactivation (T 90 ) varies considerably, depending on strain, medium characteristics, and temperature(Wigginton et al. 2015). For example, a swine coronavirus has a T 90 of 4 days at 25\u00b0 C and 24 days at 4\u00b0 C in wastewater(Casanova et al. 2009) while HCoV can survive up to 588 days in filtered tap water at 4\u00b0 C(Gundy et al. 2009). While in some circumstances, coronaviruses released into natural bodies of water may become too dilute for uptake by wildlife, there are two mechanisms where dilution of coronavirus would be minimized. The first are if effluent from WWTP is released into small body of water. For example, one of the WWTP in Fort Collins, Colorado releases its effluent into a slow moving, 8m-wide irrigation canal that is adjacent to a natural area. In addition,Medema et al. (2020) andWu et al. (2020a) found high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage at WWTP in both the Netherlands and North America. While not definitive, their results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is measurable in waste water. A second mechanism is possible bioaccumulation of coronaviruses by molluscs and other aquatic organisms. For example; clams have been found to bioaccumulate avian influenza viruses from the surrounding water(Huyvaert et al. 2012).",

Bats drink directly from natural water sources, such as lakes, ponds and slow-flowing streams and rivers, by swooping over the water sources and lapping at the surface(Korine et al.   2016). For some species, use of natural body waters was influenced by proximity to WWTP,",
