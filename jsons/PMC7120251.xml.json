            "text": "Pneumonia is common, affecting up to 1% of adults in the UK each year. Although most patients with pneumonia make a complete recovery with antibiotics and supportive care, pneumonia remains a common cause of death. Mortality among adults admitted to hospital with pneumonia is approximately 10%, with around half of deaths occurring in patients aged 85 years or older. Pneumonia has been classified according to the location and circumstances in which it develops, distinguishing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), aspiration pneumonia, and pneumonia in the immunocompromised host. Within the category of HAP, most is known about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is pneumonia arising de novo in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. This pragmatic classification indicates the most likely range of causative pathogens, thus guiding empirical antibiotic therapy.",

            "text": "While this classification system has been helpful in guiding treatment, some confusing aspects of terminology have arisen, some of which are worth considering. In particular, strictly speaking, aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury induced by non-infective liquid entering the lung (for example gastric acid in a patient whose conscious level has deteriorated rapidly, perhaps due to alcohol intoxication, and who cannot protect his/her airway and is vomiting). This scenario is usually witnessed and the aspiration is of moderate volume. Aspiration pneumonia entails repeated, clinically silent and usually un-witnessed entry of small volumes of infected material into the lung, usually from the oropharynx, in patients with chronically impaired swallow and/or consciousness (for example in patients with neurological conditions such as stroke, motor neurone disease, or multiple sclerosis). The distinction is important because, at least initially, aspiration pneumonitis does not require antibiotic treatment. Unfortunately, the two terms are often used interchangeably, and the situation is further confused in that a true bacterial pneumonia can complicate aspiration pneumonitis a few days after the initial aspiration. Similarly, the reader may encounter terms such as \u201chealthcare-associated pneumonia\u201d (HCAP)\n, which seeks to distinguish HAP from pneumonia acquired in healthcare organisations other than hospitals (e.g. nursing homes), but the range of organisms implicated are not sufficiently different for us to make the distinction here. Finally, as VAP becomes increasingly used as a marker of healthcare standards, a bewildering and confusing array of new terms (e.g. ventilator-associated events, ventilator-associated conditions, infective ventilator-associated conditions) has emerged. The key point here is that these are terms employed to aid epidemiological surveillance, and not terms that should be used to make diagnoses in real time. They will therefore not appear again in this chapter.",

Very occasionally these defences are overwhelmed, and AMs signal recruitment to the alveolus of a cellular inflammatory exudate, predominantly composed of neutrophils. Neutrophils are avidly phagocytic cells, recruited to engage, ingest, and kill bacteria. Bacteria are packaged into phagolysosomes inside neutrophils, within which reactive oxygen species and high concentrations of proteolytic enzymes are generated, leading to bacterial death. It is generally believed that the cytokines generated locally and systemically to recruit neutrophils contribute to the fever, malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, confusion, and delirium experienced by patients. In severe pneumonia, a significant contribution to lung destruction may come from toxic contents of neutrophils being spilled extracellularly and \u201cattacking\u201d the host, although there may be a contribution from bacterial virulence factors also.",

Each involved alveolus is therefore effectively contributing to \u201cshunt,\u201d with perfusion but no ventilation. Dyspnoea, and ultimately hypoxaemia, ensues if sufficient alveoli are involved. Because adjacent bronchi are not involved, if enough alveolar tissue is consolidated the chest X-ray (CXR) or CT scan often reveals the classical \u201c air bronchogram\u201d (Fig. 10.1). Similarly, air flows down a bronchus unimpeded in pneumonia, but breath sounds are distorted and amplified by the consolidated alveoli, which leads to bronchial breathing on auscultation, and whispering pectoriloquy. In practice, however, pneumonia is more commonly a patchy process (Fig. 10.2, left panel), with foci of infected alveoli rather than one large contiguous area of consolidation. Therefore, inspiratory crackles (as inspired air opens partly consolidated alveoli) are a far more common auscultatory finding than bronchial breathing. The relatively rare presentation with lobar pneumonia still provides valuable clinical information, as it is almost always caused by or (far less commonly) , usually in an expanded, consolidated right upper lobe.\n\n",

Classical studies describe a congestive phase quickly followed by \u201cred hepatisation\u201d where the lobe appears macroscopically like liver on cut section, the alveolar walls being expanded by capillaries engorged with erythrocytes (many of which spill out into the alveolus itself) and neutrophils, and the alveolar spaces filling with exudate from those capillaries (Fig. 10.2, right panel). Exudate fluid is rich in plasma proteins including fibrinogen. Fibrin strands formed in the alveolus may serve to limit the spread of infection, localise bacteria to areas where host defences are concentrated, and provide a scaffold for alveolar repair. However, excessive fibrinous reaction in severe pneumonia may potentially lead to fibrotic scar formation.",

Indeed, a feature of histological pneumonia is that alveolar walls are recognisable in the consolidation, as shown in the right hand panel of Fig. 10.2. This remarkable feat of resolution was recognised long before the widespread use of antibiotics. The process seems to be characterised by a carefully regulated process that depends on neutrophils clearing bacteria efficiently, then undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death) without disgorging their toxic contents. Macrophages ingest erythrocytes and apoptotic neutrophils, as well as scavenging extracellular debris, and migrate to regional lymph nodes. This sequence explains the classical macroscopic phases of \u201c white hepatisation\u201d as capillaries become less engorged and macrophages predominate over erythrocytes and neutrophils in the still-packed alveoli.",

These effusions are divided into \u201cparapneumonic\u201d effusions (in which the pleura produces a reactive exudate in response to inflammation but the pleural space is not itself infected), and empyema (in which the pleural space is infected). Parapneumonic effusions usually resorb and resolve spontaneously with clearance of the pneumonia, and scarring is rare.

Bacteria may be identified on Gram stain or via culture, but absence of an identifiable pathogen does not exclude empyema if the clinical and biochemical features support the diagnosis. Importantly, fibrinogen is rapidly converted to insoluble fibrin, usually leading to walled off locules of pus, such that the pleural space no longer has a single, drainable collection, but multiple small, unconnected collections (Fig. 10.3). Once empyemas become loculated, they can wall off chronic pockets of infection, which consume enormous amounts of energy, cause pain, and make chest drain insertion futile in that one tube will only drain one single locule. In the pre-antibiotic era, empyemas were well recognised to form painful sinuses through to the skin, though this is rare now.\n",

Return from foreign travel with pneumonia raises the possibility of Legionnaire\u2019s disease (especially after a stay in hotels with air conditioning systems in warm countries), and some particular pneumonias have associations with particular geographical locations (for example melioidosis in South East Asia and Northern Australia, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] outbreaks).",

Secondly, patients are commonly already taking empirical antibiotics on presentation to hospital, and it is recognised that sputum culture is less likely to give an accurate reflection of pneumonia in that setting. Thirdly, as pneumonia is infection of the alveolar regions of the lungs, it is often hard to be certain that the sample is derived from the relevant part of the respiratory tract.

Studies consistently show true pneumonia to be present in only around one-third of patients with suspected VAP. Because mucus production in the conducting airways is markedly increased in mechanically ventilated patients, tracheal aspirates are poorly reflective of alveolar pathology, and contribute significantly to false positive diagnoses of pneumonia. Unlike in most cases of CAP or HAP, the clinician has potential access to the alveolar space in that bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be performed under controlled circumstances via the endotracheal tube, and high-quality BAL specifically samples the relevant region. The clinician must choose between empirical treatment (in the knowledge that the correct diagnosis may not be VAP in two-thirds of cases) and an invasive diagnostic procedure. One large randomised controlled trial (RCT) suggested better outcomes with a bronchoscopic approach, but another showed no difference [6, 7].

However, if an organism has been confidently isolated, the general consensus is to use a single antibiotic to which it is fully sensitive for around 8 days. If no organism is isolated, then the North American view is generally to give two antibiotics with different modes of action, with the aim of covering a range of Gram-negative pathogens (most importantly P. aeruginosa), S. pneumoniae, and MSSA, with the addition of cover for MRSA if it is known to be prevalent on the ICU in question. UK guidelines give less-specific advice, but favour monotherapy where possible, making use of local microbiological epidemiology. Treatment is again recommended to be for approximately 8 days. The figure of 8 days is based on a trial that compared 15 versus 8 days of treatment, and found no difference in outcomes [14]. Interestingly, a recent paper suggests that adherence to previous American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the empirical treatment of VAP in patients at risk of MDR pathogens was associated with increased mortality [15]. The precise interpretation of these findings is difficult, but one tentative suggestion would be to seek a pathogen wherever possible in the hope of reducing the antibiotic load.",

This approach seems very sensible, but clinically it often proves challenging. Clearly this approach is irrelevant in patients in whom no respiratory samples are obtained, or in patients in whom there is an ongoing extra-pulmonary indication for antibiotics. Some centres seek to improve antibiotic stewardship by considering early withdrawal of antibiotics if procalcitonin levels are clearly decreasing in parallel with clinical improvement, or if the \u201cClinical Pulmonary Infection Score\u201d (a relatively cumbersome scoring system with a range from 0 to 12) [16] remains at \u22646 over days 0\u20133 of empirical treatment.",

In concluding this chapter, we shall consider four important aims that will be difficult to achieve, but where success could make a major difference to outcomes. The first is obviously the generation of novel ways to eradicate pathogens efficiently without toxicity to the host. The dearth of new antibiotics emerging for use in clinical practice is well documented, though intensive research continues into new ways of disrupting key bacterial survival mechanisms. In this context, increasing interest is focusing on ways to boost host innate immune mechanisms that clear bacterial pathogens, and these may begin to suggest novel, non-antibiotic-based approaches.",

This is particularly true in elderly, hospitalised patients, given that frailty and extensive co-morbidity broadens the differential diagnosis considerably, impairs the diagnostic precision of CXR, and reduces realistic chances of obtaining microbiological samples representative of the alveolar space. The ideal scenario is generation of a rapid, near-patient blood test that discriminates pneumonia from other causes of lung inflammation. This remains a distant aspiration, but there is much activity and interest in finding truly diagnostic biomarkers. There is also considerable interest in obtaining microbiological diagnoses from less-invasive specimens. Some caution needs to be exercised here. There has been an explosion of interest in the microbiome, and in whole genome sequencing of pathogens. This has fundamentally re-positioned our understanding of the normal and disease-associated microbiome deep in the lung. However, the relationship between detailed molecular microbiology of pneumonia and effective change of management is far from being worked out. Until it is, one concern is that the extreme sensitivity of molecular diagnostics may lead to detection of harmless commensals that are misinterpreted as pathogens, in turn leading to overuse of antibiotics.",
