A 59-year-old woman was admitted to the isolated ward for severe type of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the time of admission, her platelet count was in a normal range. Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding. Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal. The phenomenon disappeared after 17 days when the patient was cured. This case emphasized the importance of peripheral blood smear and clinical manifestation, especially in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.",

Combing the Chest CT scanning and other laboratory tests, she was finally confirmed with COVID-19. At the time of admission, her platelet count was in a normal range (100-400 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Although receiving the antiviral treatments with Lopinavir, Arbidol and Oseltamivir, the patient developed shortness of breath after 3 days of admission. The arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/ oxygen concentration was 276 mmHg, and IL-6 was up to140.50 pg/ml indicating a severe type. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

We collected the blood samples in EDTA tubes and monitored the routine blood cell counts. Two days later, we suddenly found a low platelet count of 91 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Her platelet count was decreasing progressively from then on. She was treated with platelet infusion twice but failed to respond. In spite of the lowest value of 17 \u00d7 10 9 /L, the patient had no signs or symptoms of bleeding. The peripheral blood smear presented platelet aggregation. Meanwhile, the IgG/IgM antibody of SARS-CoV-2 in her serum was conformed qualitatively to be positive. We collected the blood samples with both EDTA tube and citrate tube on the same day. The number of platelet with citrate was normal (118 \u00d7 10 9 /L), while that with EDTA was lower with 17 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with EDTA-PCTP. With the remission of COVID-19, the platelet count in the citrate anticoagulant samples remained normal, and the platelet count in the EDTA anticoagulant samples eventually returned to normal (Figure 1 ). One week after discharged, the patient was negative to the repeated result of IgG/IgM antibody of SARS-CoV-2, and her platelet count in the EDTA anticoagulant samples remained normal.",

The mechanism is not completely clear, but autoimmune antibody is considered to be a key factor [12, 13] . In vitro, the cryptic platelet antigen on the membrane of platelets can be exposed to the autoimmune antibody when EDTA exists. The active antigen-antibody reaction is attributed to the aggregation of platelets. What we present is the first typical case of EDTA-PCTP complicated by COVID-19. Since the patient was transferred to ICU, the medication was unchanged till the platelet count of EDTA anticoagulant returned to normal. The possible reason is that the antibody of coronavirus has the epitope binding to the cryptic platelet antigen to cause a cross-reaction of antigen-antibody. Notably, after the anti-virus treatments, the IgG/IgM antibody of SARS-CoV-2 changed from positive to negative as well as the disappearance of EDTA-PCTP. It's proved by the return of platelet counts through the blood routine examinations of EDTA anticoagulant. Thus, it's the evidence to support our inference. Due to the higher value of IL-6 which reflected the severity of COVID-19 [14] , we speculated that inflammatory factors are essential to EDTA-PTCP.",
