To develop an attenuated, immunogenic vaccine, we have previously generated chimeric viruses that encode the replicative machinery from a relatively apathogenic member of the genus, Sindbis virus (SINV), and structural genes derived from VEEV (strain ZPC738, subtype ID) (Paessler et al., 2003). The chimeric vaccine candidate SIN/ZPC was selected and extensively tested for its safety and immunogenicity in hamsters and in a variety of mouse strains with selected immune deficiencies (Ni et al., 2007, Paessler et al., 2006). It has been shown that SIN/ZPC induces a high level of protection in animals with functional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and that the passive transfer of CD3+ T cells from vaccinated immunocompetent donors protects mice lacking \u03b1\u03b2 T cells (Paessler et al., 2007).",

Among the potential targets of VEEV infection in the CNS, e.g., neurons, astrocytes and glial cells, it appears from examination of the brains of VEEV infected mice that neurons are the major target, but astrocytes may be also infected in lower numbers (16). In order to allow comparison of the results with the mouse model, we also performed experiments with 3 different astrocyte cell lines of murine origin (Alliot and Pessac, 1984). While the neuronal cell population is the major target for VEEV infection, it is unclear to what degree astrocytes may be involved in amplifying the virus and/or orchestrating the inflammatory response (Schoneboom et al., 2000, Schoneboom et al., 1999). It is known, however, that reactive hyperplasia and hypertrophy of astrocytes (gliosis) may be detected in infected brains (Audouy et al., 1999, Caccuri et al., 2003).",

First, astrocytes improve neuronal survival in a variety of injury models by taking up toxic amino acids and/or by producing factors such as neurotrophic factors needed for neuronal survival (Rosenberg and Aizenman, 1989, Zhao et al., 2004). For example, molecules that are secreted by astrocytes protect neurons against a variety of insults such as hypoglycemic damage (Cheng and Mattson, 1991), excitotoxicity (Mattson and Rychlik, 1990) and anoxia (Vibulsreth et al., 1987). Second, astrocytes have a role in neuronal differentiation and maturation (Chamak et al., 1987). A variety of growth factors produced by astrocytes, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) modulate neuron\u2013glia interactions and have mitogenic effects on astrocytes (Stitt and Hatten, 1990). Based on these important functions within the CNS, it is clear that the infection of astrocytes by VEEV may have an impact on neuronal survival either by direct \u201ckilling\u201d of astrocytes or by changing their physiological profiles and indirectly influencing their neuroprotective function and their ability to proliferate.",

A variety of molecular and cellular events may lead to the final resolution of a lesion (glial scar), and astrocytes are usually the predominant cell type involved (Fawcett and Asher, 1999). The production of the scar is potentially aimed at isolating the necrotic tissue and non-neuronal cells from the CNS parenchyma (Eddleston and Mucke, 1993), with the final goal of protecting surviving neurons (Silver and Miller, 2004). However, one of the negative aspects of the scar formation is the inability of the host to proceed with axonal regeneration in the injured area and to fully repair the damage (Silver and Miller, 2004).",

Our data show that VEEV infection leads to a similar \u201cstress-response\u201d in infected human astrocytes characterized by the release of bFGF, which is a prototype growth factor of the FGF family that includes some 22 members in vertebrates (Ornitz and Itoh, 2001). Induction of bFGF in human astrocytes also correlated with the peak of virus replication and development of cythopathic changes, suggesting a damage-dependent secretion. This observation is in contrast with previously described results obtained with rat astrocytes, in which apparently upregulation of potentially neurotoxic immunomodulators such as TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS was reported, leading to the speculation that astrocytes may contribute in a negative way to pathology and apoptosis of neuronal cells in VEEV infected brains (Schoneboom et al., 1999). The late glial scar formation in survivors may also limit the ability of the host to repair the axonal damage and thus may be a factor contributing to the high rate of occurrence of neurological sequelae in people surviving alphaviral encephalitis. We suggest that the production of growth factors in the VEEV infected brain may be of considerable importance, previously poorly recognized, and more detailed characterization of this response will contribute to better understanding of the CNS phase of the disease.",

Direct IFN-\u03b3 secretion by NHA was demonstrated in our study with a 4-fold increase post exposure to the SIN/ZPC chimera over uninfected controls and an approximately 2-fold increase with TC83. In contrast, the wild type VEEV replicated to high levels without increasing the production of IFN-\u03b3. It is well-known that IFN-\u03b3 has very important antiviral functions and, while some overlap with defense pathways induced by type I interferons, others appear to be more strongly activated by IFN-\u03b3. One of the best characterized pathways is the induction of the enzyme nitric oxid synthetase 2 (NOS2), described in the literature as inducible NOS (MacMicking et al., 1997). The activation of NOS2 may have a direct impact on the function of viral proteins and therefore negatively impact virus amplification. Additionally, there is a long and still growing list of various interferon-inducible genes that may encode for proteins with GTPase activity (Carlow et al., 1998, Taylor et al., 1996, Taylor et al., 2000). It is well known that early IFN-\u03b3 production, which may depend on induction of IL-12 secretion, is present in many human and animal viral infections (Biron, 1999).",

Elevated IL-8 levels have also been demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid of children with both bacterial and viral meningitis (Shapiro et al., 2003). IL-8 release by NHA was markedly upregulated by 48 h (3.2-fold increase at the secreted protein level), and differences between treatments (virulent versus attenuated virus) were noted as early as 24 h. IL-1\u03b2 is a potent agonist for upregulation of CNS expression of both KC and MIP-2, which also mediate recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation (Anthony et al., 1998). Transgenic expression of IL-1\u03b2 in the hippocampus of mouse brain results in marked upregulation of KC (Shaftel et al., 2007). In this model, KC was found to be linked to expression in astrocytes but not microglial cells. Increased pathogenicity of coronavirus infection in the CNS has been associated with neutrophil recruitment and proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CCL-2, and IFN-\u03b3) (Ireland et al., 2008), and similar influx has been noted in the mouse model of VEEV (Paessler et al., 2006, Paessler et al., 2007). Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediated signaling in response to dsRNA results in upregulation of IL-8 and IP-10 in astrocytes (Park et al., 2006). These results are similar to the cytokine profiles that we obtained for NHA following exposure to SIN/VEEV.",

G-CSF is a growth factor with a role in systemic homeostasis by regulating the production of neutrophils from stem cells in the bone marrow (Demetri and Griffin, 1991). More recent studies have shown a neuroprotective effect following treatment with G-CSF in response to various injuries or other stimuli such as ischemia (Gibson et al., 2005, Komine-Kobayashi et al., 2006, Park et al., 2005, Solaroglu et al., 2006b, Schneider et al., 2005, Sheibani et al., 2004). G-CSF has been proposed to be down-modulatory with respect to inflammation in the CNS and may have a similar role in the post-exposure response by astrocytes and other cells types after viral exposure (Solaroglu et al., 2006a). Inflammation and the recruitment of autoreactive T cells have been shown to be reduced in G-CSF treated animals in an EAE model of disease (Zavala et al., 2002). Specifically, G-CSF treated mice demonstrated reduced demyelination and reduced CNS cytokine and chemokine expression. This effect was countered in the periphery by increased production of MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP-1, both pro-type 1 and type 2 factors. These effects were also correlated with reduced production of TNF-\u03b1, which corresponded with a reduced inflammatory response. Other potential activities for G-CSF involve modulation of antigen-presenting cell activities (Rutella et al., 1999). RANTES, IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1b are upregulated by 30 h post exposure to the chimeric SIN/ZPC strain with peak levels by 50 h post exposure. Chemokines direct the trafficking of specific subsets of inflammatory cells, and potentially play key roles in the pathogenesis of viral CNS disease, repair and cellular communication. Regarding flavivirus infections, RANTES is expressed by primary mouse cells infected with Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV). Several cell types are involved including primary neurons with glia, mixed glia, microglia, and astrocytes, but not pure neuronal cultures (Chen et al., 2004).",

            "text": "In summary, we show that VEEV efficiently infects both human and murine astrocytes in cell culture as well as in the murine brain. The astrocyte response to VEEV infection in vitro appears to be aimed more toward promoting neuronal protection rather than activating antiviral innate immune response, which may allow the virus to grow more efficiently in brain. In contrast, the attenuation of virus growth of the chimeric vaccine candidate correlates positively with the induction of a strong proinflammatory innate response in astrocytes. It appears that the VEEV vaccine strain TC83 is similar to the wild-type VEEV in efficiently infecting human and murine astrocytes while inducing a host response comparable to the wild-type virus. This correlates with the fact that TC83 is virulent for mice if introduced directly into the brain as previously reported by others (Fine et al., 2008, Julander et al., 2008, Paessler et al., 2003, Steele et al., 1998) and our group (Paessler et al., 2003). Future studies are needed to identify how the virulent VEEV suppresses (or avoids inducing) the proinflammatory response in astrocytes.",
