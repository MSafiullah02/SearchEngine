Earthquakes, bombings, industrial catastrophes, plane crashes, fires-our colleagues look to us in those times to act quickly and courageously to save lives. From domestic events, such as the Boston Marathon bombing, to those across our borders, like earthquakes in Haiti and elsewhere, orthopaedic surgeons have been on the front lines. Not this time. Now, during the biggest health crisis of our lifetime, we find ourselves on the sidelines, a challenge that many of us in the orthopaedic community feel profoundly, as other authors have expressed 1 .",

In this medical disaster, the heroes are the emergency-medicine physicians, internists, intensivists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and ancillary hospital staff. Internists and emergency-medicine physicians are long-accustomed to sorting through intertwined illnesses, whereas intensivists can provide the most extreme care during the arduous days patients spend recovering on a ventilator. It is demanding, time-intensive work.",

A few of us have actual training and experience as intensivists and so can make the shift from the sidelines if needed to put those skills to work. Some of us have the knack of thinking broadly about all illnesses a person might have, not just zeroing in on 1 surgical issue, and can help with the diagnosis and triage of COVID-19 patients. Every one of us is, by nature, hard-working, detail-oriented, and self-sacrificing when it comes to patient care. Those skills and attributes can all be helpful now.",

            "text": "Another key attribute that will serve us well is our team mentality. Throughout our training and careers, we have been accustomed to considering ourselves as members of the orthopaedic team. We are reminded of this by each daily consult email our department receives, in which the resident greeting is \"Good Morning, Team\" or simply just \"Team.\" With this mentality, we understand that everyone on the team plays an integral role-from the heroes to the supporting players. Of particular importance during this time, being a good team member requires the willingness to fill in where needed. Within the past few weeks, our role has shifted to that of helpers, and we are now playing for a larger team: our hospital system. At our hospitals in Boston, we had the relative luxury of planning for reassignment ahead of the surge in patients who are COVID-19-positive and requiring admission. We have tried to learn from our colleagues in harder-hit New York City, so in each of our hospitals, we have organized to reassign staff-residents especially-to the intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency departments (EDs). The authors of another recent JBJS \"What's Important\" article shared their perspectives on such redeployment in a New York City hospital 2 . As our own surge of patients has now begun, we have started those reassignments.",

We have actually had to make a waiting list for opportunities to serve outside of orthopaedics, in the ICUs and ED. Once assigned, our residents have given 100% of their intellect, adaptability, and capacity for hard work to help their new teammates. They have learned rapidly and accurately to diagnose COVID-19 and to help manage those patients from initial presentation to intensive care on ventilators. The residents who have volunteered say they feel well-protected and well-trained; we are fortunate to have enough masks and other personal protective equipment. Our COVID-19 protocols are clear, sensible, and easy to follow. Many ICU and ED providers are \"COVID-19 veterans\" already, and everyone is willing to answer questions. Most importantly: they have made it clear that our help has been genuinely useful. We take our lead from our residents and provide support as needed. The work we will do will not be glamorous: we will enter orders, gather vital signs, and follow checklists. In all sincerity, we would be honored just to bring coffee to the ICU nurses, but we will get to do more than that. In this public health crisis, we will be helpers, not heroes, and that is just fine. n ",
