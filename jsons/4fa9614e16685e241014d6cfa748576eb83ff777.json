Amoxicillin is often used for sinusitis and 71 other upper respiratory tract infections similar to azithromycin and has not been associated adverse events of interest were death and TdP/QT prolongation. To capture each 75 adverse drug event, Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) were utilized, which aggregate 76 MedDRA \"Preferred Terms\" into meaningful broader categories. To further increase confidence 77 in the results, the analyses also included SMQs for \"dummy\" outcomes of accidents/injuries and 78 depression as these unrelated medical conditions or events should not be affected by possible 79 drug-drug interaction effects. 80 81 A structured query captured all FAERS reports that included HCQ/CQ, azithromycin, or 82 amoxicillin.

In FAERS, the unexposed are representative of all other FAERS reports. PRRs are 90 interpreted as being potentially meaningful in pharmacovigilance based on the lower level of the 91 95% confidence interval (Lower95CI) \u22652.0. 14-16 Values less than that are often deemed not to 92 indicate a potential safety signal.

For 101 azithromycin, there was a significant safety signal detected with an Lower95CI of 3.80 for 102TdP/QT prolongation. No other events were significant for the azithromycin group. For the 103 combined HCQ/CQ+azithromycin group (n=600 total reports), the Lower95CI was 1.80 with a 104 wide confidence interval range. For amoxicillin as a control comparison, there were no safety 105 signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. 106 107 DISCUSSION 108Although multiple ongoing trials are investigating the efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination 109 with azithromycin, safety concerns are often not resolved in small scale clinical studies. 110 Therefore, monitoring of spontaneous reporting systems is necessary to ensure the safety of 111 repurposed or novel therapeutic options. No significant safety signals were observed for 112 HCQ/CQ when used alone using a disproportionality analysis approach with FAERS data. 113However, when azithromycin was used alone, it was associated with a significant safety signal 114 related to TdP/QT prolongation. With HCQ/CQ+azithromycin, results did not reach the threshold 115 to indicate a significant safety signal which is likely a result of the small number of reports 116 evident in the wide confidence interval range. 117118These results are consistent with a pre-print report of an analysis conducted in an international 119 distributed data network analysis of electronic health records and claims databases.17  That 120 analysis showed that short-term treatment with HCQ appears to be safe, whereas the use of 121HCQ+azithromycin was associated with 15-20% increases in the risks of angina, chest pain, 122 and heart failure along with two times the increase in cardiovascular mortality. Nevertheless, 123 their study design does not elucidate whether the increased risk with HCQ+azithromycin is due 124 to a potential drug-drug interaction or solely the azithromycin adverse effect. 125 126 It should be emphasized that neither the current study nor the pre-print study mentioned above 127 were conducted in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Both studies captured patient 128 populations utilizing these medications for common indications such as lupus and sinus 129 infections. Results from ongoing clinical trials are desperately needed in order to understand the 130 efficacy of HCQ for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Further, safety analyses must 131 consider the disposition of the patient as safety outcomes, particularly TdP/QT prolongation, 132 which may be more common in critically ill patients with impaired renal or liver function, 133 electrolyte abnormalities, and other medical conditions. 8 134 135 Several strengths could be mentioned for the present study. First, FAERS database has the 136 capability to capture rare safety events such as TdP/QT prolongation. Second, this analysis was 137 strengthened by including both control drug exposures and control safety events as means to 138 assess potential reporting biases. However, there are some limitations to the analysis inherent 139 to the data source. FAERS safety reports do not include a denominator of medication users, 140 and may not be used to report rates or relative measures between exposure groups. FAERS 141 data are spontaneously reported and subject to reporting biases associated with public 142 knowledge of a safety issue, release of new medications, or masking effects due to imbalance 143 in event reporting associated with other medications. 15,18 However, more recent time periods 144 were excluded since the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, and reporting biases are less", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "no funding for this research.
