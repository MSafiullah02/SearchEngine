[1] [2] [3] Healthcare worker infection was reported to be as high as 20% in various countries, especially when they were unprepared or had not donned adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). [4] [5] We sought to mitigate risks to our patients and healthcare personnel by conducting group simulation sessions aimed at identifying unanticipated issues that arise during a Protected Code Blue (PCB) while caring for COVID-19 patients, which involved rapid cohort training and workflow improvements. 6 The Singapore National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board Ethics Committee approved this study.",

She subsequently develops a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest secondary to hypoxaemia leading to code blue (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) activation by the first responder nurse. The simulation was facilitated by an intensivist and a nurse educator. Each simulation session consisted of 8-10 participants: 2 doctors and 3 nurses (total of 5) were actively involved in the scenario, while the rest were observers. Each simulation session involved new participants who had not observed or participated in previous sessions. A total of six sessions of simulation were conducted over two weeks with a total of 50% of the nurses and 80% of the doctors in the unit completing the cohort training.",

When the code response team arrived, the first responder nurse handed over the case to the code response team and functioned as a runner nurse outside the isolation room after proper doffing of PPE.

We have since conducted N95 mask fitting sessions and PPE and PAPR training sessions 8 for all the acute care teams. To facilitate communications between staff inside the isolation room and the runner nurse, we implemented use of white board to minimise the need for opening of the isolation room door and its associated risk of cross contamination. PAPR battery failures and flow check failures were reported, hence we implemented a daily PAPR calibration check and procured replacement and standby batteries. Most issues were identified during the first two simulation sessions and were promptly addressed. Issues encountered are detailed in Appendix 3.",

We implemented intubation as a priority in resuscitation to minimise the extent and duration of aerosol-generating mask ventilation. We developed pre-packed COVID-19 packages for common procedures such as intubation, and intra-arterial and central venous line insertions to minimise the need for staff movement and associated risk of cross contamination. We also modified the layout of our ICU rooms with specific considerations for seamless donning and doffing of PPE and PAPR and provisions for hand hygiene. (Figure 1) In conclusion, in situ simulation resulted in rapid cohort training evidenced by improvements in the time to key events in resuscitation and team competencies with each subsequent simulation session. The simulation sessions allowed testing and improvement of processes and training of staff through prompt sharing of lessons learnt from previous sessions to all staff, attributing to the improvement observed over the six sessions. A comparable approach emphasizing the imprantnce of infection prevention 9 with similar findings has recently been reported from Hong Kong. 10 We also achieved higher levels of educational outcomes (Level 4a BEME-Modified Kirkpatrick's level) with change in organizational practice or delivery of care, attributable to an educational program. 11",
