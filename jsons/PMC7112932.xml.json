            "text": "Membrane fusion is the prerequisite event that allows enveloped viruses, some of which are linked to emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), to enter their host cells. Among these emerging diseases, AIDS has become a global threat to human health. The discovery of a membrane fusion inhibitor has made HIV-1 Env an important target for anti-HIV-1 chemotherapy (Chan et al., 1997, Eckert and Kim, 2001, Este and Telenti, 2007, Poveda et al., 2005, Weissenhorn et al., 1997). Recently, a new class of inhibitor that blocks the interaction between Env and its co-receptor, CCR5, has been developed (Santoro et al., 2004). A simple phenotyping method of Env-mediated membrane fusion will facilitate progress in the development of new inhibitors or in the evaluation of drug-resistant mutants (Olson and Maddon, 2003).",

The system employs a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP), split GFP (spGFP), which has been engineered to have the capacity for self-assembly (Cabantous et al., 2005). The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Lemmon, 2008) was fused at the N-termini of spGFPs so as to focus the signal in the membrane regions. These spGFPs become fluorescent only when they have reassociated with each other (Cabantous et al., 2005) during the membrane fusion. Unlike an enzyme-based assay, this spGFP system allows real-time monitoring of the membrane fusion process without any additional substrates.",

The oligonucleotides were combined and assembled by PCR (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 40 s for 30 cycles). Similarly, 30 oligonucleotides, which overlapped each other with 18 bases at the both ends, were used to assemble the optimized GFP gene, named GFPopt1\u201311. The primary sequences of the PH domain and GFPopt1\u201311 are shown in Fig. 1A. Both amplicons were cloned and sequenced in pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). GFPopt1\u201311 was split into GFP1\u201310 (1\u2013642 base pairs) and GFP11 (643\u2013696 base pairs), at a point between the 10th and 11th \u03b2-sheets of the GFP. The subscripts 1\u201310 and 11 reflect this location. The PH-GFP1\u201310 and PH-GFP11 genes were generated by combining the PH domain gene with the spGFP genes. These genes were then cloned to pdEGFP, which was constructed by deleting the EGFP gene in pEGFP-N2 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) (Fig. 1B). The expression vector for each protein was named by adding pd in front of the target protein, such as pdPH-GFP1\u201310.",

The green signal was observed at the plasma membrane surrounding several red nuclei (Fig. 4A). The red nuclei were derived from the 293FT cells expressing Env as pNHcRedEluc expressed the nuclear-localizing HcRed proteins. The unique localization of green signal in the membrane region made it easy to differentiate the real signal from the non-specific autofluorescence background. Furthermore, the non-envelope-mediated spontaneous fusions, if they occurred, could be ruled out by the absence of red nuclei in the syncytia. This result indicates that the simultaneous use of pNHcRedEluc and spGFPs allows us to monitor membrane fusion directly without the addition of dyes or substrates.",

For a comparison, in addition to the spGFP assay, the fusion assay using the Env(+)- or receptor(+)-cells expressing GFP and DsRed, respectively was used. In the spGFP assay, the number of the GFP signal-positive cells was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, left column). In a parallel assay, the number of the fused cells indicated by the presence of the both GFP and RFP signals in the fused cells was decreased similarly (Fig. 4B, right panel). The new spGFP assay was much easier to monitor, because the green signal was only observed when the actual fusion took place. In a conventional method relying on the mixture or redistribution of the two colors was more time consuming, because each cell has to be scored for the presence of either or both colors.",

The combination of dye-transfer and fluorescence-activated cell sorting can achieve this (Huerta et al., 2002, Lin et al., 2003). However, the system reported in this study is much simpler than these methods because it generates the detectable signal only when fusion actually occurs. In the dye-transfer assay or similar \u201ccolor\u201d-mixing assay shown in Fig. 4B, one has to discriminate the simple aggregation from real fusion because the dye signals are persistent throughout the assay.",

If one can clone the envelope genes from clinical samples into an appropriate expression vector, this system may be useful for detecting a minor population of Env that possesses the different co-receptor usage. Such a tropism assay can be easily adapted by using CCR5/CD4+ cells together with CXCR4/CD4+ cells. Similar identification of fusion foci can be achieved if GFP is used as a reporter gene in a transcriptional factor transfer assay, such as T7 RNA polymerase or Tat (Barbeau et al., 1998, Feng et al., 1996, Lin et al., 2005, Sakamoto et al., 2003), but the need for de novo transcription/translation steps may result in a longer lag time for signal generation. Of course, membrane fusion by viruses other than HIV-1 can be monitored easily.",
