            "text": "The family Polyomaviridae are classified as group 1 viruses in the Baltimore classification scheme as they contain double stranded DNA genomes. There is a single genus designation within the virus family (Polyomavirus) and this genus contains 14 different species that infect at least 8 different mammalian species. In addition to containing dsDNA genomes all members of this virus family are non-enveloped. The members of the family typically display restricted species and cell type specificity for lytic infection but many can induce the transformation of cells that do not support lytic infection. Host cell and species-specific transcription and replication factors contribute significantly to the restricted specificity displayed by these viruses (Feigenbaum et al., 1987, Lynch and Frisque, 1991, Tada et al., 1989). Virus-receptor interactions are also known to contribute to cell type specificity and more importantly to pathogenesis in vivo (Caruso et al., 2007, Chen and Atwood, 2002, Dubensky et al., 1991, Freund et al., 1991a, Freund et al., 1991b, Fried et al., 1981). Like many other virus families the polyomaviruses use multiple and often distinct receptors and entry mechanisms to infect cells. At high enough multiplicities many of these viruses can infect cells using alternative often poorly described mechanisms. The structures of two major members of the family have been solved in complex with receptor fragments and this has given insight into how these viruses recognize host cells (Liddington et al., 1991, Neu et al., 2008, Stehle and Harrison, 1997, Stehle et al., 1994). A major area of current investigation by several labs is focused on understanding the intracellular trafficking of polyomaviruses in host cells and the mechanisms involved in virus uncoating and delivery of the dsDNA genomes to the nucleus. This paper will overview the field of virus structure and entry from its beginnings to the present. The focus will be on the mouse polyomavirus, on SV40, and on the two major human polyomaviruses, JCV and BKV.",

He noticed that mice inoculated with cell free extracts from leukemias were capable of not only transmitting leukemia to na\u00efve animals but that some of the animals also developed parotid tumors. In classic experiments he found that the \u201cparotid\u201d agent could be distinguished from the mouse leukemia virus by filtration. Filters with larger pore sizes allowed both viruses to pass but filters of smaller pore size selectively trapped the leukemia agent indicating that the parotid agent was smaller than the leukemia virus. In the mid to late 1950s Stewart and Eddy followed up on these observations and found that the \u201cparotid\u201d agent was capable of inducing many different types of tumors when inoculated into mice and renamed the virus \u201cpoly\u201doma from the Greek for many tumors (Eddy et al., 1958, Stewart et al., 1958).",

Shortly after virus cultivation a number of groups began examining the interaction of mPyV with host cells using both biochemical and electron microscopy (EM) techniques. Infection of cells by the mPyV was envisioned as a multi-step process that included virus adsorption, virus penetration, and virus uncoating. Morphological studies documented that whole virions were taken up into cells by phagocytosis as membrane bound single particles and membrane bound aggregates (Mattern et al., 1966, Mattern et al., 1967). Virus particles then appeared between the nuclear membrane but viral particles were not seen within the nucleus at these early times. This led to the conclusion that viral particles uncoat between the nuclear membranes and before they reach the nucleus (as we will see later this interpretation is largely correct with some minor modifications).",

The ability to plaque purify virus preparations allowed for an enrichment of infectious virions and for their separation from empty capsids by density gradient centrifugation. Detailed analyses of these individual populations by EM indicated that empty capsids and light populations of virions (pseudovirions) were endocytosed by two different pathways (Bolen and Consigli, 1979, Mackay and Consigli, 1976). Virions and pseudovirions were predominantly endocytosed as single membrane-bound particles that trafficked intact to the nucleus. Empty capsids were endocytosed as aggregates into large vesicles that later appeared to fuse with lysosomes, apparently destined for degradation. A model was developed showing these two opposing endocytic routes in the cell (Fig. 1\n).",

Using radiolabeled preparations they identified six species of VP1 (A\u2013F) by isolelectric focusing (Bolen et al., 1981). Only virions and pseudovirions were found to contain species E leading the group to hypothesize that species E was critical for delivering virions and pseudovirions to the nucleus. Antibodies raised against virions that were found to be neutralizing specifically recognized species D, E, and F supporting this hypothesis (Bolen et al., 1981). The group then went on to attempt isolation of cellular receptors for mPyV by preparing anti-idiotypic antibodies to VP1 (Marriott and Consigli, 1985, Marriott et al., 1987). These antibodies blocked infection and pulled down several proteins associated with cell surfaces. The identities of these proteins were never determined and none were found to act as receptors for the virus.",

            "text": "The mPyV and the two human polyomaviruses, JCV and BKV are known to require sialic acid for binding to host cells as \u201creceptor destroying enzyme\u201d or neuraminidase inhibits the viruses' ability to agglutinate red blood cells and to infect cells (Table 1\n). SV40 was thought not to attach to sialic acid as it did not agglutinate red blood cells and neuraminidase treatment of host cells did not reduce infectivity (Clayson and Compans, 1989). However, SV40 does attach to a sialic acid containing receptor, ganglioside GM1, with sialic acid being the major contact point, but the narrow specificity of SV40 for GM1 prevents it from binding to carbohydrates on red blood cells. In addition, the neuraminidase used for treating cells before challenge with SV40 does not cleave the sialic acid off GM1 so that it leaves the receptor intact (Miller-Podraza et al., 1982). It can even cleave sialic acid off higher order gangliosides to yield GM1. Therefore, neuraminidase treatment did not reduce SV40 receptors on cells and did not abolish infectivity. Early reports in the mPyV system suggested that the sialic acid interactions were largely due to non-specific electrostatic interactions between the virus and these negatively charged cell surface carbohydrates. Subsequent studies by the Paulson group proved this hypothesis to be incorrect (Cahan and Paulson, 1980, Fried et al., 1981). They showed that mPyV recognized specific sialic acid structures on red blood cells and on mouse cells containing \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid. Small and large plaque binding variants of mouse polyomavirus were subsequently shown to have different affinities for a branched compound that additionally contained a second, \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid. Large plaque strains bound less well to the branched structure than did the small plaque strain (Cahan et al., 1983). These data correlated well with an earlier study showing that small plaque viruses adsorb to cells much better than the large plaque strains (Diamond and Crawford, 1964).",

More importantly these differences in plaque behavior directly translated to their behavior in mouse models of infection (Dubensky et al., 1991, Freund et al., 1991a). The large plaque strain spread more efficiently in mice and induced a higher frequency of tumors and the tumors were more widespread than those caused by the small plaque strains. This led to the hypothesis that the branched structures act as pseudoreceptors that are bound by the virus, but do not result in productive infection. The analysis of virus\u2013host cell interactions was thus important for understanding spread and pathogenicity of this group of viruses and generated increased interest in identifying specific receptors.",

This was found to be mediated by an LDV integrin binding motif present in mPyV VP1 as a specific mutation in this motif reduces infectivity (Caruso et al., 2007). Interestingly, when inoculated into newborn mice, the mPyV displays an altered pattern of infection when compared to wild type (Caruso et al., 2007). Previous receptor hunting experiments described above would have missed this ligand as the virus apparently needs to undergo a conformational change after binding to sialic acid that then allows it to bind to the integrin receptors as a second step in the entry process. It is not certain whether infection of all cells requires this second step but it is clear that in some cases it is utilized. However, the LDV motif is buried under the receptor binding loops deep within VP1, and the mutation could have affected the structure of the binding site indirectly.",

The Rapoport group used sucrose flotation assays to initially ask whether mPyV would float when mixed with plasma membrane preparations from human erythrocytes, from bacterial membranes or from yeast membranes. They found that when mPyV was incubated with buffer or with either bacterial or yeast membranes the virus fractionated in the bottom third of the gradient. When mPyV was incubated with plasma membrane from human erythrocytes the virus floated to the top of the gradient indicating an association with plasma membrane lipids. Upon treatment of the plasma membranes with neuraminidase the virus failed to float and fractionated at the bottom of the gradient. Specific gangliosides were then tested for their ability to interact with polyomaviruses. mPyV only floated to the top of the gradient in the presence of GD1 and GT1b, and SV40 only floated to the top of the gradient in presence of GM1. The group then showed that rat cells cell deficient in complex ganglioside biosynthesis are poorly susceptible to mPyV and SV40 infection. However, when preincubated with GD1a or GT1b they become highly susceptible to mPyV and GM1 restores susceptibility to SV40. Fluorescent co-localization studies indicated that the virus traffics directly to the ER with the gangliosides (Fig. 2\n).",

            "text": "This mode of internalization is strikingly similar to the one used by ER directed bacterial toxins of the AB5 family, such as cholera toxin, whose known receptors are gangliosides. In the case of the toxins, however, trafficking proceeds through the Golgi. Thus far there is no evidence that mPyV or SV40 traffics through the Golgi and instead they appear to traffic through caveosomes to eventually reach the ER where partial uncoating of the viruses take place. Once the mPyV reaches the ER it takes advantage of an unusual member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, ERp29 (Magnuson et al., 2005) (Fig. 2). PDI family members are oxidoreductases that contain one to several CXXC motifs in their thioredoxin domains (Hebert and Molinari, 2007). They function to both reduce and oxidize disulphide bonds in newly synthesized proteins. They also isomerize disulphide bonds assisting in the formation of native protein structures. ERp29 is structurally related to PDI proteins but it contains only a single cysteine in its entire sequence and hence can only function in the isomerization reaction. A role for ERp29 in normal cellular functions has not been established. The Tsai group identified ERp29 as the PDI family member responsible for inducing a conformational change in mPyV VP1 that exposes a trypsin sensitive site in VP1 (Tsai et al., 2003) (Fig. 3\n). This conformational change is thought to result in the proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal arm of VP1. As the C-terminal arm is involved in linking and stabilizing pentamer\u2013pentamer interactions its cleavage would be predicted to destabilize the particle. The cleavage also led to the formation of a virion particle capable of binding and penetrating a lipid bilayer. This is predicted to facilitate the release of a partially disassembled and de-stabilized virion into the cytosol where nuclear localization signals in the VP1 protein could direct it across the nuclear pore (Fig. 3). Work from the Benjamin lab identified another ER protein as being critical for mPyV infection. In this study shRNAs directed at a protein involved in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins out of the ER, Derlin 2, was found to significantly impair mPyV infection (Lilley et al., 2006) (Fig. 3). In related work Helenius and colleagues found that several ER associated factors played critical roles in SV40 disassembly and release from the ER (Schelhaas et al., 2007) (Fig. 3). Inhibition of PDI, ERp57, and Derlin 1 by siRNA knockdown all inhibited SV40 infection of cells. Knockdown of ERp29, calnexin or calreticulin had no effect on SV40 infection. They found that ERp57 uncoupled the 12 five-coordinated VP1 pentamers of SV40. This led to complete uncoating in the presence of EGTA, which removes the calcium ions that help to anchor the incoming C-terminal arms. The group also demonstrated a role for Derlin 1 and SelL1, two proteins involved in the ERAD retrotranslocation pathway in SV40 infection (Fig. 3). The model that emerges is one where the virion is delivered to the ER where it is recognized by components of the ER quality control machinery and is subjected to PDI related proteins that isomerize specific disulfide bonds involved in linking pentamers together within the capsid. The destabilized virion is then recognized essentially as a misfolded protein and is retrotranslocated out of the ER where it encounters a low calcium environment in the cytosol. Calcium is critical for viral particle stability and low levels of calcium in the cytosol likely contribute to further destabilization of the virion. Exposure of nuclearlocalization signals in viral capsid proteins that likely remain bound to the mini-chromosome then transport the mini-chromosome across the nuclear pore (Ishii et al., 1996, Kasamatsu and Nakanishi, 1998, Nakanishi et al., 1996, Yamada and Kasamatsu, 1993) (Fig. 3). It thus appears that at least two polyomaviruses, mPyV and SV40, utilize ER associated degradative pathways for uncoating.",

Hummeler and colleagues followed the fate of SV40 particles in cells by electron microscopy (Hummeler et al., 1970). They describe the majority of particles becoming rapidly enveloped at the plasma membrane into monopinocytotic vesicles. SV40 particles could be seen as early as 1 h post-infection in the nucleus. Maul and colleagues subsequently investigated the uptake and trafficking of SV40 in permissive and non-permissive cells (Maul et al., 1978). No qualitative differences were seen between the two cell types indicating that these steps did not restrict virus infection of cells. Their findings were very similar to those of Hummeler but they described several intervening steps in the entry process including a prominent association of viral particles in tubular membrane structures and of particles associated with rough ER. They did observe particles in the nucleus but these particles were not surrounded by membrane. They proposed a model where the entry of SV40 followed a series of membrane fusion and fission steps eventually liberating virions in the nucleus for uncoating. As they observed some free virions in the cytoplasm and some in the nucleus they proposed that the nucleus must contain an uncoating enzyme not present in the cytosol. As it turns out it appears that the ER contains the necessary factors for uncoating. The tubular structures they observed were likely virions pinching off in large tubular structures from caveosomes as described by Helenius many years later (Pelkmans et al., 2001). These tubular vesicles are transported to the ER in a microtubual dependent manner (Pelkmans et al., 2001) (Fig. 2). We now appreciate that most if not all polyomaviruses are trafficked to the ER where uncoating occurs or at least begins.",

Caveolae are membrane microdomains rich in sphingolipids and signaling molecules. SV40 exploits these domains most likely by virtue of its interaction with the ganglioside GM1. Entry is relatively slow and proceeds in a pH neutral manner from caveolae to caveosomes to the ER (Pelkmans et al., 2001). In addition to the ganglioside GM1, SV40 was also reported to use MHC class I molecules to infect permissive cells (Atwood and Norkin, 1989) (Table 1). The virus can infect some cells lacking MHC I and in these cases GM1 is the principle receptor although infection is inefficient. The relationship between these receptors remains unclear.",

JCV can use either an \u03b12,3- or an \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid to infect permissive glial cells (Dugan et al., 2007, Liu et al., 1998) and a ganglioside (GT1b) may also be involved (Komagome et al., 2002) (Table 1).

Paramyxoviruses bind to their host cells with their haemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase protein that uses the same binding site for attachment to NeuNAc and cleavage of its glycosidic bond (Crennell et al., 2000). We will, however, focus here on viral proteins that solely mediate attachment and do not possess enzymatic activity. Sialic acid binding by catalytically active viral neuraminidases is probably not directly comparable to binding by attachment proteins, as neuraminidase function requires high affinity as well as additional binding energy to distort the sialic acid for catalysis. Neuraminidases thus feature deeply buried binding sites with a higher number of specific contacts than are found in attachment proteins.",

            "text": "Although most of the attachment proteins listed above are not homologous and are found on unrelated enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses, there are some general similarities in the modes of oligosaccharide binding. First, in all viral complexes, NeuNAc is the major, and in the case of Ad37 and VP8\u204e the only, point of contact. This distinguishes these complexes from, for example, bacterial toxins, which can also recognize sialylated receptors but form more contacts with carbohydrates attached to sialic acid than with the sialic acid itself (Fotinou et al., 2001, Merritt et al., 1994, Stenmark et al., 2008). Second, all viral attachment complexes bind NeuNAc in shallow depressions rather than deep grooves on the protein surface. The affinities for these interactions are only in the millimolar range, which is consistent with the exposed binding surfaces (Burmeister et al., 2004, Dormitzer et al., 2002b, Eisen et al., 1997, Neu et al., 2008, Stehle et al., 1996). A relatively low affinity may in fact be crucial for a productive viral infection as a very tight attachment to the host cell will prevent progeny virus from spreading. Third, the attachment protein complexes all feature NeuNAc in its chair conformation, which is the preferred conformation in solution. Fourth, as detailed in the next section, there are several parallels in the strategies used by attachment proteins to bind sialic acid.",

The mPyV and Ad37 form salt bridges from the positively charged side chains of Arg and Lys residues to the negatively charged carboxylate group (Figs. 4E and C, respectively). By contrast, the other three viruses engage the carboxylate group with two parallel hydrogen bonds. In each case, the carboxylate group accepts two hydrogen bonds from two specifically spaced hydrogen bond donors in the proteins. In the Influenza HA, SV40 VP1 and Rotavirus VP8\u204e complexes, these are either the hydroxyl groups of Ser and Thr side chains or backbone amido groups (Figs. 4B, D, E). These parallel hydrogen bonds also have similar geometry. For each of them, the angle between the carboxylate C1, the carboxylate O that is engaged and the hydrogen bond donor approaches 120\u00b0.",

The N-acetyl group, situated on the opposite side of the sugar ring as the carboxylate group, can serve as additional \u201chandle\u201d on NeuNAc and it provides specificity by additional favourable contacts with the correct ligand. The N5 atom of the N-acetyl group is contacted by a hydrogen bond in each of the complexes. The binding partners are hydrogen bond acceptors in the protein, such as backbone carbonyl groups (Figs. 4B\u2013D), the side chain carbonyl group of an Asn residue (Fig. 4F) or the hydroxyl group of a Tyr side chain (Fig. 4E). The mPyV VP1 also forms an additional hydrogen bond by an Asn side chain, which contacts the carbonyl group of the acetyl function. With the sole exception of mPyV VP1, the binding sites of all proteins also feature a depression into which the methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety inserts. This depression is shallow and rather hydrophobic in the case of Ad37, Influenza HA and Rotavirus VP8\u204e, as it is lined with hydrophobic side chains (Figs. 4B\u2013D). Interestingly, SV40 VP1 does not feature such a shallow depression to accommodate the methyl group. Rather, it has a substantially deeper pocket that is formed by hydrophobic residues such as Leu65 and Phe75 and lined with hydrophilic side chains of residues Gln62 and Gln278 at its rim (Fig. 4F). The natural hosts of SV40 are monkeys, in which N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NeuNGc) is the predominant sialic acid. In contrast to the human NeuNAc, NeuNGc has an additional hydroxyl group attached to the methyl group. The big, partly hydrophilic and likely water-filled cavity in SV40 could likely accommodate the more polar NeuNGc better than NeuNAc (Campanero-Rhodes et al., 2007), which might account for its shape.",

In addition, most also feature a depression that accommodates the methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety. Since all binding surfaces are exposed, the interactions determining NeuNAc binding lie in the rather polar environment of the protein surface. The polar interactions are therefore probably quite weak. Hydrogen bonds between sialic acid and protein atoms can be replaced by contacts between water molecules and protein atoms without much difference in energy. Salt bridges in aqueous solution also possess less energy than salt bridges that are located in a partially hydrophobic, solvent-inaccessible environment. Likewise, the non-polar van der Waals interactions between carbohydrate and protein are also not very strong as such interactions increase in strength with the area of surface buried in the contact. Most of the contacts described above exclude rather small areas from solvent compared to the extensive interfaces found in protein\u2013protein complexes.",

            "text": "Different strains of Influenza A virus infect different species because their HA molecules bind sialic acid in different contexts. The adaptation of avian HAs to human hosts occurs by a switch in binding specificity from avian-like \u03b12,3-sialylated glycans to the longer \u03b12,6-sialylated glycans that are present in the upper respiratory tract epithelia of humans (Russell et al., 2006, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Stevens et al., 2006, van Riel et al., 2007). NeuNAc is bound in the same orientation and by the same residues of both avian and human HAs so that specificity is conferred by the residues in contact with additional monosaccharides. Recent data indicate that the different glycan types are not discriminated by contacts with the sugar residue to which the NeuNAc is linked, but that the different overall topology of the glycans is recognized (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008). Given the preferred torsion angles of the NeuNAc-\u03b12,3-Gal-\u03b21,3/4-GlcNAc motif typical of the recognized \u03b12,3-linked glycans, the Gal-\u03b21,3/4-GalNAc part is fairly linear and can occupy the space delineated by a cone with NeuNAc at its tip. Sugar moieties farther away from the NeuNAc mostly do not interact with the protein in this conformation. The glycans containing \u03b12,6-linked NeuNAc, for which NeuNAc-\u03b12,6-Gal-\u03b21,4-GlcNAc is typical, can also adopt this cone-shaped topology. However, these also sample a topology, in which the Gal is relatively fixed with respect to NeuNAc and there is a kink at the Gal position, forcing the GlcNAc and subsequent sugars to point back towards the protein. The space that can be sampled by the glycan therefore resembles an umbrella, with NeuNAc-\u03b12,6-Gal as the stick and the rest of the glycan as the umbrella. For \u03b12,6-linked trisaccharides that can sample both cone- and umbrella-shaped topologies, the cone-shaped one is preferred. However, the longer \u03b12,6-linked glycans that confer infectivity in humans prefer the umbrella-shaped topologies, leading to additional contacts with the protein. If the HA of an influenza strain cannot accommodate these long, umbrella-shaped \u03b12,6-linked glycans, it cannot spread in humans (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008).",

In the case of SV40, only the correct GM1 receptor bound to the protein. Smaller, unbranched components of the GM1 structure would not have given insight into SV40 receptor binding as they do not bind with detectable affinity (Neu et al., 2008).

            "text": "The original studies describing polyomavirus host cell interactions depicted infection as involving a series of discrete steps that included virus adsorption, virus entry into membrane bound organelles, and virus trafficking by sequential membrane fusion and fission events. Although there was controversy regarding whether these viruses could penetrate the nuclear envelope intact an early pivotal study demonstrated that the virus capsid only penetrates the outer nuclear envelope. Recent studies on these viruses describe largely the same series of steps but in significantly more detail. We now know and appreciate that the majority of these viruses recognize specific linkages of sialic acid on gangliosides and glycoproteins. These viruses also recognize other cellular components such as the 5HT2a receptor for JCV, \u03b14\u03b21 integrin for mPyV, and the MHC class I protein for SV40, likely as part of a receptor complex with gangliosides or other sialic acid containing structures. There are clear cell type specific and viral strain differences that determine what components of the receptor complex are required to initiate infection. Once bound to cells all of these viruses induce molecular signals that initiate infectious entry. The mPyV, SV40, and BKV all infect cells by caveolae dependent endocytosis. Non-caveolar cholesterol dependent mechanisms can also be exploited by some of these viruses depending on cell type. Downstream of both caveolae and raft dependent mechanisms the viruses traffic to a pH neutral caveosome that lacks markers of other cellular organelles. High resolution video microscopy of virus entry has found that these viruses are trafficked out of the caveosomes in elongated tubular structures that fuse with the ER membrane. This trafficking step is dependent on microtubules. The human polyomavirus, JCV, appears to be an exception and rather than utilizing caveloae to enter cells this virus exploits clathrin dependent mechanisms to initially traffic to early endosomes. In the early endosomes JCV is found to be tightly opposed to the inner leaflet of the endosome and in a pH and Rab5 dependent step traffics from the early endosome to caveosomes. At this point the virus likely follows the fate of other polyomaviruses and travels to the ER. Once in the ER the viruses take advantage of protein disulfide isomerases to rearrange their capsid structure. In the case of SV40, PDI and ERp57 rearrange the 12 five-coordinated VP1 pentamers. The now misfolded structure is recognized by components of the ERAD pathway (Derlin 1, SelL1) and exported to the cytosol. Calcium levels in the cytosol of resting cells are significantly lower (0.1 \u03bcM) than levels in the ER (100\u2013400 \u03bcM). As calcium is required to stabilize polyomavirus virions the low levels of calcium encountered as the destabilized virus exits the ERAD pathway are likely sufficient to further distort and disassemble the virion and prepare it for transport through the nuclear pore. In the case of mPyV a novel PDI like protein, ERp29 acts to unfold VP1 exposing a protease sensitive site in the C-terminal arm of the protein. Once cleaved the destabilized particle can insert into a lipid membrane. The virus may directly escape the ER via this mechanism or it might utilize the retrotranslocator Derlin 2 as inhibition of this protein reduces mPyV infection. It is likely that the two human polyomaviruses use similar mechanisms to escape the ER but this has not been formally demonstrated.",

Subsequent high resolution structural studies provided the molecular basis for this unexpected capsid construction. It revealed that the interpentamer contacts are primarily mediated by C-terminal extensions of VP1, termed arms, that protrude in different directions from each VP1 monomer and contact neighboring pentamers. Both pentavalent and hexavalent pentamers donate and accept five C-terminal arms to tie the capsid together. The VP1 pentamer cores and the contacts between incoming arm and acceptor monomer are identical throughout the capsid, demonstrating that the polyomavirus capsid also uses a form of quasiequivalence as the basis for its construction. Recent high resolution structural studies on viral capsid proteins in complex with receptor fragments has provided a detailed picture of how these viruses engage this component of the receptor complex. This level of detail may provide the basis for the design of small molecular weight compounds capable of antagonizing polyomavirus host cells receptor interactions and may in time lead to novel therapeutic approaches to treat patients with polyomavirus induced disease.",
