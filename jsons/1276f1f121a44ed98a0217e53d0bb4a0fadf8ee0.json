H9N2 influenza virus, a low pathogenic avian influenza viruses' subtype, has become endemic in different types of domestic poultry in lots of countries, resulting in great economic loss due to reduced egg production or high mortality associated with coinfection with other pathogens. These two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens to aggravate the disease, and often cause mixed infection in clinics. Co-infection of C. psittaci with H9N2 commonly induces severe pneumonia and high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. According to previous studies, we postulated that C. psittaci infection may beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11. Consequently, in this study, we clarify the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11, which is the first study of the coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro.",

However, the pathogenesis is still unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that C. psittaci infection execrates macrophage function and facilitates H9N2 infection. To explore the potential mechanism, we studied the effect of C. psittaci and H9N2 on the functions of HD11 cells in vitro by simultaneous infection of C. psittaci and H9N2. At the same time, we used infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone as the control groups. The results showed that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to C. psittaci or H9N2 infection alone. In addition, coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 did not induce high C. psittaci loads compared to C. psittaci infection alone at 12-and 24-hours post-inoculation (hpi), but coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could increase the loads of H9N2 compared to H9N2 alone in HD11 cells at 12 hpi. More importantly, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels, enzyme activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and phagocytosis were reduced significantly in the group with C. psittaci and H9N2 coinfection compared to those of H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Finally, C. psittaci infection induced robust expressions of type Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, while interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) displayed a significant decrease compared to H9N2 infection alone at 24 hpi. All the above data indicate that C. psittaci infection can facilitate H9N2 invasion and to aggravate severe avian airsacculitis by impairing macrophage functions.",

However, these two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens, and thus can aggravate diseases. More recently, it was reported that C. psittaci and H9N2 often cause mixed infections in clinic. Our previous study found that C. psittaci infection increases the mortality of avian influenza virus H9N2 by suppressing the host immune response [15] . In addition, coinfection of C. psittaci with H9N2, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), and Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) contributes to severe pneumonia and a high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, explaining why severe avian airsacculitis is prevalent in the winter season in northern China [16] .",

The depletion of macrophages from mice prior to infection with Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) and C. psittaci results in increased morbidity and pathogen burdens [17, 18] . Macrophage activities may not contribute to pathogen clearance, because C. psittaci is able to survive and deliver to other tissues by using the macrophage as a \"vehicle\" [19] . Macrophages activated by interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are associated with increased mortality of macrophages, nitric oxide (NO) production, secretions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and pro-inflammatory cytokines [20] . In this study, we illustrate the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11.

The detection system uses a proprietary asymmetric cyanine dye, which is blocked by living cells but can stain the DNA of dead cells. When the dye binds with DNA, it emits fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence signal produced by the dye bound to the dead cell DNA is directly proportional to the cytotoxicity. We operated strictly according to the protocol, adding 50 \u00b5L cells with a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 5 /mL to the 96-well cell culture plate. Then, we added 100 \u00b5L CellTox TM Green reagent (Madison, WI, USA), and after incubation for 15 min, it was put into a fluorescence enzyme labeling instrument.

The tissue or cell homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g and 4 \u2022 C for 10 min. The clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh pre-chilled tube and kept on ice. The protein concentration was measured, and the lysates were used immediately to assay NOS activity. Then, 30-60 \u00b5L (200-400 \u00b5g protein) of cell/tissue homogenate or purified protein was measured into the desired wells in a 96-well plate. For the positive control, NOS enzyme was diluted 1:20 in NOS Dilution Buffer just before use. Next, 5-10 \u00b5L of the diluted NOS enzyme was added into the desired well(s), and the volume of the sample and the positive control wells were made up to 60 \u00b5L/well with the NOS Assay Buffer. Enough reaction mixes for the number of wells (standards, positive control, and sample) were prepared to be analyzed, which were then mixed well and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. After incubation, 90 \u00b5L of NOS Assay Buffer was added to the standard, positive control, and sample wells, and subsequently 5 \u00b5L of the enhancer was added into each well, which were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After this, 50 \u00b5L of Griess Reagent 1 and 50 \u00b5L of Griess Reagent 2 were added to the standard, positive control, and sample wells, which were then mixed and incubated for 10 min, before the absorbance (540 nm) was read using a microplate reader. The nitrite standard curve was plotted and the iNOS activity calculated according to the formula: sample iNOS activity = nitrite amount in sample well from standard curve/(reaction time \u00d7 amount of protein) = pmol/min/\u00b5g = mU/mg.",

Our major finding was that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to the effects of infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. Moreover, the iNOS expression and enzyme activity, as well as NO concentration, of HD11 cells were significantly reduced compared to those of C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. In other words, coinfection of C. psittaci with H9N2 could stimulate HD11 cells to express less iNOS and NO compared to infection with H9N2 alone. In addition, coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 induced lower phagocytosis of HD11 cells than H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Furthermore, both the mRNA expression and cytokine levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly increased at 24 hpi in the C. psittaci + H9N2 group. On the contrary, the Th1 cytokines of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6 were significantly increased in the C. psittaci + H9N2 group compared to those of C. psittaci or H9N2 alone at the early stage. Later, only TNF-\u03b1 secretions were increased significantly compared to those of the C. psittaci group at 24 hpi. All the above data support our hypothesis that C. psittaci infection could aggravate the infection of H9N2 by impairing macrophage functions, leading to the outbreak of severe respiratory diseases.",

It was the first report that C. psittaci infection can induce immune suppression in vivo and can lead to increased susceptibility to H9N2 infection. It also suggested that we should consider primary infection by C. psittaci in any respiratory disease, and should eradicate it during the treatment of avian respiratory disease. In addition, other studies have also reported the role of C. psittaci and H9N2 in the pathogenesis of coinfection. In this sense, coinfection is a common infection of two or more pathogens in the same host. Similar coinfection occurs frequently in human cases. For example, in 1918, in the human influenza virus pandemic, almost all cases of death were caused by bacteria mixed infection, and the additional bacterial infection greatly increased the risk of death [25] . Moreover, the combination of malaria and helminth is prevalent in less-developed countries [26] . Hence, identifying the primary pathogen of the mixed infection has been underestimated due to limited investigation. Traditionally, low pathogenic avian influenza virus triggers primary infection, and then the secondary infection of bacteria follows [27] . Since 2007, the outbreak of avian airsacculitis has been documented by the mixed infection of various pathogens [28] .",

            "text": "Macrophages play an important role in innate immunity, such as phagocytosis, antiviral infection, and enhanced immune regulation. Pathogens infect the body and the monocytes after infection of the main target cells. After entering macrophages, Chlamydia can escape immune surveillance and transport to the whole body with macrophages, and thus macrophages act as the delivery system for Chlamydia [19] . Therefore, it is necessary to study how macrophages play a role in the host's immune response to the pathogen, as well as the pathogenesis of the pathogen, after the study of Chlamydia and H9N2 infection. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and its activity have been shown to be involved in the reaction of L-arginine decomposition into NO and L-citrulline. Endotoxin or cytokines, such as LPS and IFN-\u03b3, can induce chicken macrophages to produce iNOS, and to further produce NO [29] . Our research shows that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly decrease the iNOS expression level and enzyme activity, as well as the NO concentration, of HD11 cells compared to H9N2 or C. psittaci infection alone. However, the potential mechanism is unknown. The monocyte macrophage system has the function of phagocytosis and the killing of pathogens and tumor cells directly. In our study, we found that coinfection induced lower phagocytosis of HD11 cells compared to H9N2 infection. All this evidence illustrates the mechanism of macrophage dysfunction post-coinfection or after C. psittaci infection alone. Cytokines secreted by macrophages are also important components of their immune regulation. Here, several pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines were determined by mRNA expression and ELISA cytokine kits. The role of Th1/Th2 cell cytokines is important in the immune response to chlamydial infection. It appears that the Th1 CD4 cell response plays a dominant role in protective immunity, while Th2 CD4 cytokines (particularly IL-10) play a role in the immunopathology of chlamydial infection. Products of Th2 cells do not facilitate the production of IFN-\u03b3 or inhibit Chlamydia growth [30] . TNF-\u03b1 regulates critical cell functions, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. Macrophages are the major producers of TNF-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to play a pivotal role in orchestrating the cytokine cascade in many inflammatory diseases [31] . Increased TNF-\u03b1 levels have been associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease post-infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) [32] . IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine known to play a critical role in chronic infections caused by intra-cellular organisms. During chlamydial infection, high IL-10 secretion was shown to be associated with pathogenesis in a mouse model of Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection [33] . In the present study, high TNF-\u03b1 production was induced by coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2, and this might be associated with increasing the increased mortality of the HD11 cells. In our results, the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 were increased significantly in the coinfection groups, suggesting that chlamydial infection mediated the polarization of Th1/Th2 to the Th2 direction. The dominant role of Th2 cytokines hampers immune function, so that pathogens can evade immune surveillance and immune attacks. The Th2 polarization was consistent with our previous data, implying that immune suppression is aggravated post-artificial infection with H9N2 and C. psittaci [15] .",

Understanding the mechanisms and effects of coinfection will improve the understanding of the common pathogenicity mechanisms. Since 2007, severe respiratory infections and avian airsacculitis in chickens in many parts of China have been the result of coinfection with bacteria and viruses. The role of viral-bacterial coinfection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received enough attention, and should be emphasized in future investigations. We have established a SPF chicken model of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in vivo. At this point, it is urgent to continue to study cell models of coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro. In this study, we did such work and found that infection with C. psittaci will increase the replication of H9N2, decrease the iNOS-NO pathway, and raise the IL-6 and IL-10 expression of HD11 cells by H9N2 infection. At the same time, C. psittaci infection can also reduce the phagocytosis of macrophages. Like the results of previous animal models, we found that C. psittaci can reduce the function of immune cells in many ways, thus aggravating the susceptibility of H9N2. In addition, the further findings of this study are that not only does C. psittaci aggravate H9N2 infection, but also H9N2 can increase the mortality caused by C. psittaci infection.
