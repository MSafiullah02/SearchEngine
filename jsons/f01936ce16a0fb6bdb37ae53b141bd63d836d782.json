We present a statistical model which can be employed to understand the contagion dynamics of the COVID-19, so that its impact on finance can possibly be anticipated, and digitally monitored. The model is a Poisson autoregression of the daily new observed cases, and considers both short-term and long-term dependence in the infections counts. Model results are presented for the observed time series of China, the first affected country, but can be easily reproduced for all countries.",

This is clearly exemplified in the recent work of Yu et al. (2019) , who show how artificial intelligence, econometrics, statistics and fast parallel computing can join their efforts to build a Financial Risk Meter (FRM, see Mihoci et al. 2020) , that provides an easy-to-read and interpretable monitor of the impact of stressful events in finance. Such a monitor can be applied not only by policy makers, to take informed decisions, but also by citizens, to increase the knowledge and understanding of stress events, and of their impact, so to improve awareness and, eventually, acceptance of measures aimed at contrasting the source of such stress.",

Figure 1 clearly shows that the largest impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will be on the intermediate risk classes (B, BB, BBB, which correspond to about 65% of Italian SMEs), for which the default probability could go from 0.98 to 2.14% (under scenario a) and possibly from 0.98 to 3.29% (under scenario b).

We report the results of FRM application to European financial markets, in Fig. 2 . Figure 2 clearly shows the impact of the COVID-19 on the European financial markets, in two subsequent phases. The first one starts on February 21st, when the news about the outbreak of local contagion in Italy becomes of public domain. The second starts on February 27th, when many positive contagion cases are also reported for France, Germany and the UK. In both cases, there is a sudden increase in the systematic risk values, both in their main body (the boxplots, which also show an increased variability between the constituent markets) and in their maximum values (the red line on top). Again, we remark that the results in Fig. 2 are constantly updated, and publicly reported, at: http://frm.wiwi.hu-berli n.de. From the previous considerations, it seems that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on companies, financial institutions and markets is high. On the other hand, it is clear that this impact depends on what is the perceived effect of contagion, especially at the country level, as this is the level at which most policy-making decisions are taken. We believe that digital finance can, once more, help, by attempting to provide predictive models for COVID-19 diffusion for each country which can be made accessible on-line, to better inform the decisions of policy makers and to improve the awareness and the willingness to accept restrictive measures, also on the economic side. In addition, the same contagion diffusion measurements could be implemented in risk monitors, as the ones shown before, to improve predictions.",

The next section presents the proposed model. Section 3, instead, presents the results from the application of the model to the available time series for China.

In the study of epidemics, it is usually assumed that infection counts follow an exponential growth, driven by the reproduction number R 0 (see, e.g., Biggerstaff et al. 2014) . The latter can be estimated by the ratio between the new cases arising in consecutive days: a short-term dependence. This procedure, however, may not be adequate, as the incubation time is quite variable among individuals, and data occurrence and measurement is not uniform across different countries (and, sometimes, along time): these aspects induce a long-term dependence.",

Specifically, the component represents the short-term dependence on the previous time point. The part expresses instead the long-term dependence on all past values of the observed process, and can, thus, be interpreted as a trend component. Its inclusion is analogous to moving from an ARCH (Engle 1982) to a GARCH (Engle and Bollerslev 1986 ) model in Gaussian processes, and allows to capture long memory effects. The advantage of a log-linear intensity specification, rather than the linear one known as integer-valued GARCH (see, e.g., Ferland et al. 2006) , is that it allows for negative dependence.

On February 13th, besides laboratory-confirmed cases, also clinically suspected cases are reported, and also retrospectively, creating a data spike of more than 15,000 cases. This additional counting, and consequent data inflation, has continued until February 18th. The WHO report of February 20th states that, from February 19th, only laboratory-confirmed cases are included, exactly as before February 13th. We decided to consider only laboratory-confirmed cases, in line with World Health Organisation (2020). Figure 3 reports the observed dynamic of the counts of daily new infected cases in China, in the considered period. Figure 3 shows that COVID-19 contagion in China has completed a full cycle, with an upward trend, a peak, and a downward trend. The application of our model can better qualify these conclusions. The estimated model parameters for China are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that all estimated autoregressive coefficients are significant, confirming the presence of both a short-term and a long-term dependence. From an interpretational viewpoint, the estimate of shows that, if the expectation of new cases for yesterday was close to 0, 100 new cases observed yesterday generate about 40 new expected cases today. According to the value estimated for , an expectation of 100 new cases for yesterday generates instead about 2 new expected cases today, if no cases were observed yesterday. These results show that, at the writing date, the short-term component is driving the infection count process in China, which is well beyond the peak. Additionally, we remark that the goodness of fit of the model To gauge the impact of the growth in contagion counts on digital finance, we measure its direct impact on financial markets.

            "text": "We remark that daily contagion counts are available also for the days in which the markets are closed. However, we assume that the signal that matters for market is the variation in the level of contagion over two consecutive open market days. This assumption is in line with the underlying rationale of epidemiologic models, whose core is the reproductive number of the virus ( R 0 ), usually calculated from the ratio y t y t\u2212m , with an m that can vary according to the random variation of the incubation time. In this sense, the markets do not have special reasons to consider m = 1 rather than an m that is equal to the number of consecutive days of open markets ( m = 3 during weekends, for example). Figure 4 reports the observed time series of the SSE index returns r t , along with the corresponding observed series of the contagion counts variation in China, v t , for the considered period. For the sake of clarity, we reported both series with their calendar interruptions, due to weekends or vacation periods. Figure 4 shows that the two curves are initially positively correlated: before the beginning of February the number of infected cases (as can be seen in Fig. 3) is still low, and the market does not seem to react. In the first week of February, instead, after the Chinese New Year's celebrations, contagion tops up and the SSE index plummets. Negative correlations, although weaker, are observed also during the following weeks. Indeed, the overall Pearson correlation coefficient between the two series is equal to \u22120.33 and significant (p value = 0.025). We remark the count variations in Fig. 4 are based on the observed counts, which may be affected by daily random variations. A good statistical model for disease counts should be able to capture the core part of the counts variation, smoothing away the random component. To verify this statement, we also consider the relationship between the financial market returns and the fitted values of the proposed Poisson autoregressive model. Such values are plotted in Fig. 5 , along with the SSE index returns, similarly as before.",
