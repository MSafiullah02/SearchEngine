However, government officials are unable to succeed in these aims unless they have the cooperation and goodwill of clinicians, in particular medical practitioners working in primary health care and hospital settings. Medical practitioners carry the responsibility of making a diagnosis, of reporting cases of disease, of managing the cases and family members; they often are needed to identify other close contacts and may be called upon to provide prophylactic chemotherapy or immunisations to these contacts as well. In some jurisdictions medical practitioners have additional responsibilities. This chapter provides an overview of the duties and obligations of medical practititioners under public health legislation by reference to English-language legislations from a selection of jurisdictions in Europe, North America, Australasia, Asia and Africa.",

It is acknowledged that many cultures, Western and Eastern, ancient and more recent, developed practices which were concerned with preventing the transmission of infection from one person to another. Some examples are the use of variolation to prevent cases of smallpox and the more recent invention of vaccination, using material from cowpox sores, for the same purpose; the isolation of lepers; distribution of clean drinking water through reticulated systems protected from sewage contamination; drainage of swamps to eliminate mosquitoes responsible for malaria transmission; and the enforcement of quarantine of vessels carrying diseased individuals.",

Broad public health laws were a nineteenth century development. Chadwick\u2019s landmark exploration of the health impact of the industrial revolution, his 1842 Report on the sanitary condition of the labouring population, found that, particularly in overcrowded, poorer quarters of the industrial cities, the population was virtually living among rivers and lakes of sewage [2]. Despite the increasing application of the scientific method, by the early Victorian period, the germ theory had not yet gained acceptance and the generally understood cause of what we now know as infectious diseases was the emanation called \u201cmiasma\u201d arising from the raw sewage and rotting material that contaminated much of the urban environment. Chadwick\u2019s report and a resurgence of the second cholera pandemic together forced the British parliament to pass the Public Health Act in 1848 \u201cAn act for promoting public health.\u201d This legislation required local government authorities to employ staff responsible for public health: the medical officers of health and inspectors of nuisances [3]. These two disciplines provided, respectively, the capacity to assess illness among members of their local communities, and the power to examine the living conditions of those communities and to remove the sources of \u201cmiasma\u201d to which were attributed what we now know as infectious diseases.",

In the particular case of Victoria, between 1854 and the passage of its most recent statute, the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008, there were 20 separate versions of the Public Health Act or as it was known for most of this period, the Health Act, as well as numerous brief amending Acts. Some of the requirements, under earlier Acts, are no longer considered necessary, such as the \u201cInfant life protection\u201d powers introduced in 1883 to register and regulate people who nurse and feed infants under the age of 2 years, or the requirement for compulsory smallpox vaccination. Other provisions have been transferred to separate legislation, such as those related to food and drug safety, fire precautions, building of public hospitals and prohibition on growing of narcotic plants; quarantine powers were ceded to the Commonwealth of Australia upon its establishment.",

In Sydney, a medical practitioner wrote, not long after, to the British Medical Journal with an anecdote which casts a little light on the tensions around disease control legislation and the role of medical practitioners. He stated that a fatal case of smallpox in the Sydney epidemic had failed to be reported by the patient\u2019s physician, who was subsequently censured by the members of the local branch of the British Medical Association. He goes on to say that very soon after this meeting was publicized, the NSW parliament passed the Infectious Diseases Supervision Act, which made notification of smallpox compulsory by medical practitioners, at pain of 50 pounds [currency] penalty [5].",

The occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and continuing threat of highly pathogen avian influenza viruses with potential to become communicable to and between humans prompted a complete reevaluation and eventual re-design of the International Health Regulations. The new Regulations are based around the obligation of all countries to report to the World Health Organisation, rather than just three diseases, any \u201cevents which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern.\u201d This reporting must be undertaken by signatory countries through a \u201cnational focal point.\u201d In order to meet this obligation, countries are required to develop their capacity for surveillance and response to such an extent that they will be able to detect a significant public health event and, by an appropriate investigation, determine whether it reaches the threshold for notification to the World Health Organisation [6].",

The rationale for this in NSW public health legislation, from the 1991 Act onward, has been to reduce the burden on general (family or primary care) practitioners for notification. This is effected by limiting the number of diseases they must notify to those readily diagnosed in the primary healthcare setting, for example, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) and making the conditions notifiable by hospital personnel those which should most likely require admission to hospital for assessment and diagnosis, for example, typhoid fever or meningococcal disease.

This requires the notifying medical practitioner to provide the case\u2019s identity to the authority.

Where medical practitioners are mentioned, it is generally to say that a patient must submit to examination by a medical practitioner; sometimes, as in the UK Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, the practitioner is nominated by the authority. These provisions may then open the way for the authority to direct medical practitioners to take certain actions in respect of such patients. The Singapore Infectious Diseases Act 1976 requires a practitioner to furnish the authority with any information required for control of a disease or outbreak \u2013 this is a broad requirement and may apply to either a disease notification or information obtained following assessment of a patient directed under the Act to submit to medical examination. When a patient is directed under the Malta Public Health Act 2003 to have a medical examination by the public health authority, the Act requires the medical practitioner to conduct the examination promptly and to furnish a written report to the authority, with penalties provided if the practitioner fails to do so. The Victoria Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 obliges the medical practitioner to provide written results of the examination or specified tests to both the authority and the patient.",

The experience of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with its high morbidity and mortality in hospital staff, identified reluctance among some healthcare workers to care for cases because of quite reasonable concerns for their own health or for the health of their own family members [20, 21]. The Ontario Health Protection and Promotion Act 1990 was amended in 2007 to allow the public health authority to direct medical practitioners and other healthcare providers to use personal protective clothing and equipment during an infectious disease outbreak.",

Medical practitioners, in clinical practice, have a vital role in the control of diseases of public health concern. This role is reflected globally in the obligation, under health legislation, for medical practitioners to notify the public health authority of specific details of named patients suspected of having these diseases. While the principle is universal that the notification include the identity of the patient, so as to allow prompt and direct public health action if needed, jurisdictions have varying approaches to many other aspects of notification: the actual list of notifiable conditions; who must notify and based on what degree of diagnostic certainty; in what timeframe and with what specific details; what information is to be provided to the case; and who bears responsibility for contact tracing. In some jurisdictions, medical practitioners have associated statutory obligations and powers, related to the examination of a patient directed by the public health authority to be assessed, the furnishing of reports of such examinations, the role of the practitioner in ordering a patient into isolation, and responsibilities of medical practitioners in public health emergencies.",
