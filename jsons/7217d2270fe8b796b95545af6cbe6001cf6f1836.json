RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .73-1.44]; P = .87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .30-1.44]; P = .29).",

Different preparations of recombinant rIFNs (rIFN-\u03b12a, rIFN-\u03b12b, rIFN-\u03b21a, and rIFN-\u03b21b) are active against MERS-CoV in vitro [5] .

High doses of RBV/rIFN-\u03b12b administered 8 hours after inoculation of rhesus macaques with MERS-CoV resulted in reduced viral loads and was partially effective in preventing progression to pneumonia compared to animals that were untreated [3] .",

In addition, because of therapy initiation was not standardized, such studies are prone to 2 sources of bias: immortal time bias and indication bias. Immortal time bias may occur because patients in the therapy group have survived for a period of time before receiving the therapy. Because the outcome (death) could not possibly have occurred during this period in this group, this type of bias systematically underestimates adverse outcomes (eg, death) [11, 12] . Indication bias occurs when the association of the therapy and outcome is caused by the indication for which the therapy was used and not to the therapy itself. If physicians typically prescribe certain therapy, such as RBV/rIFN, only when the clinical condition is not improving or is worsening, standard multivariable analyses may overestimate the association with poor outcome. Addressing both immortal time and indication bias in observational studies requires accounting for baseline and time-varying confounding associated with the decision to initiate treatment.",

We calculated stabilized weights for the probability that each subject received the treatment, censored on the day of therapy, ICU discharge, or 28-day mortality, whichever came first. We included in this model selected baseline characteristics as well as time-dependent variables (SOFA on the index day of RBV/rIFN initiation and the previous day, ventilation status on the index day and on the previous day [0: not ventilated, 1: noninvasive ventilation, 2: invasive mechanical ventilation, 3: oxygen rescue therapy], hemoglobin, WBC count, AST and creatinine on the index day, and corticosteroid therapy on the index day). We included corticosteroid therapy as a time-varying covariate, as we have shown previously that corticosteroid therapy in critically ill MERS patients might prolong MERS-CoV RNA clearance although it was not associated with difference in mortality [19] . Because these values were recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, we imputed missing values for the remaining days (Supplementary Methods). We used a weight-trimming approach to deal with extreme weights; weights <5th percentile value were fixed at the 5th percentile value and weights >95th percentile value were fixed at the 95th percentile value. This process continued until the average weight reached approximately 1. Then, we used a weighted regression model using these weights taking in consideration the repeated-measures nature of the data to estimate the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality.",

What are the possible explanations for lack of clinical and virological benefit? First, it has been shown that the RBV concentrations required to inhibit MERS-CoV replication are much higher than clinically achievable concentrations with oral dosing [5] . Second, the lack of rIFN effectiveness may be related to the type used. One study examined the in vitro MERS-CoV susceptibility to different rIFN preparations (rIFN-\u03b12b, rIFN-\u03b3, rIFN-universal, rIFN-\u03b12a, rIFN-\u03b2) and found that rIFN-\u03b2 had the strongest MERS-CoV inhibition, at 41 times lower than the previously reported 50% inhibitory concentration (56.08 U/mL) of rIFN-\u03b12b [5] . Another in vitro study found that serum concentrations achievable at therapeutic doses of rIFN-\u03b2-1b were 3-4 times higher than the in vitro inhibitory concentrations of MERS-CoV, whereas those of other rIFN preparations and RBV were lower than inhibitory levels [24] . Of note, none of the patients in the current cohort received rIFN-\u03b2-1b. An RCT (MIRACLE) is currently recruiting patients examining the effect of a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and rIFN-\u03b2-1b on mortality of hospitalized patients with MERS [16] . Third, the positive, but modest, effect observed in previous rhesus macaque experiments occurred after very early treatment (8 hours after inoculation of with MERS-CoV) and with the administration of high doses of RBV/rIFN-\u03b12b. In contrast, it took a median of 5 days for patients in our cohort to present to the hospital and another 4 days to start therapy.",

Limitations include its retrospective nature and lack of randomization (and therefore inevitable initial imbalance in potential confounders). Although marginal structural models adjust for time-varying confounding, unmeasured confounders cannot be entirely excluded. Quantitative data on viral loads were not available. Because practices for repeating MERS-CoV rRT-PCR varied among centers and because of competing risk of mortality, sufficient data to assess MERS-CoV RNA clearance were available for only about 50% of the patients. RCTs remain the best approach to derive the most unbiased estimates of treatment effect. Most patients included in this study were diagnosed with MERS prior to the launch of the first therapeutic RCT mentioned earlier (MIRACLE). Since then, efforts have focused on considering eligible patients in this trial. .71",

For logistic regression, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to assess the model fitness, and P values were not significant for all analyses. For marginal structural model, adjustment was made for the same afore mentioned baseline characteristics and for the following time-varying covariates: SOFA on the index day of RBV/rIFN initiation and the previous day, ventilation status on the index day and on the previous day (0: not ventilated, 1: noninvasive ventilation, 2: invasive mechanical ventilation, 3: oxygen rescue therapy), hemoglobin, white cell count, aspartate aminotransferase and creatinine on the index day, and corticosteroid therapy on the index day. For Cox proportional hazards regression model and marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model, we censored patients if they never cleared MERS-CoV RNA or at the time of last real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test.
