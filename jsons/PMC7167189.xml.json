Furthermore most previous studies have indicated that the majority of hMPV\u2010positive patients are children of young ages [McAdam et al., 2004; Vicente et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013; Reiche et al., 2014], which is similar to the findings of the present study. The peak of hMPV infections was found in the spring in the present study, which is similar to that of Beijing [Zhu et al., 2011], but different from that of Chongqing where the peak of hMPV epidemics are observed in the spring/summer and the winter/spring seasons [Zhang et al., 2012]. In the United States, hMPV infections have been reported to occur predominately in the winter and spring seasons [McAdam et al., 2004]. These unique characteristics of hMPV infections may be related to the geographic region and climate, and requires the further study for verification.",

The present study revealed a rather high mixed infection of hMPV with other viruses (45.9%) and HBOV was the most frequently detected virus with hMPV. The rates of hMPV coinfection of previous studies range from approximately 9.4% to 70.8% [Zhu et al., 2011; Fathima et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2014], and the commonly co\u2010detected viruses include RSV, HRV and PIV\u20103. These discrepancies are most likely due to the differences in the types of viruses examined and the test methods employed in the studies. However, the discrepancies may also be related to the selection of research objects, geographic regions and research periods. Previous studies have indicated that mixed infection may aggravate the diseases and affect prognosis [Greensill et al., 2003]. In the present study, lung auscultation did reveal that rhonchi were more common in patients with mixed hMPV infection compared with patients with single hMPV infection. However, no other significant differences were found between the patients, including the requirement of supplemental oxygen and duration of hospitalization.",

The annual distribution indicated that genotype A2 and genotype B1 prevailed alternately. Previous studies have reported the prevalence of certain predominant hMPV genotypes in a given year. hMPV sub\u2010genotypes may vary in different years and alternative predominance of hMPV sub\u2010genotypes has been observed [Matsuzaki et al., 2008; Pitoiset et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013]. The present study found that the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features were fundamentally similar among patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV, which is consistent with the results of some studies [Bosis et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2013]. Diarrhea was a clinical manifestation that occurred more frequently in patients infected with type B hMPV compared with patients infected with type A hMPV in this study. However, there are different epidemiological and clinical findings in other two studies [Matsuzaki et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012]. Furthermore, a study indicated that patients with type A hMPV infection are often associated with more severe symptoms [Vicente et al., 2006]. However, there is no apparent link between the genotype of hMPV and the severity factors of the disease in other studies [Agapov et al., 2006; Pitoiset et al., 2010]. Certainly, more data are needed to elucidate this issue.",
