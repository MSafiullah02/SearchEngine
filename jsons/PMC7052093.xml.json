For this purpose, after transiently reducing the respiratory rate to 10 breaths/min to reduce the risk of air trapping, a prolonged expiration was performed while abruptly reducing PEEP from its baseline value to 5 cmH2O for one breath. The difference in end-expiratory Vt between the breath while PEEP was decreased and the one before was defined as the total change in lung volume [34]. At the same time, we estimated the minimal predicted change in lung volume determined by the PEEP change, as previously described [35]. Briefly, the respiratory system compliance at low PEEP was multiplied by the pressure difference between the two PEEP levels. Then, this value was subtracted from the total change in lung volume and the result was considered as an estimation of derecruited lung volume induced by PEEP reduction [34, 35]. In addition, in the whole population, we estimated the degree of derecruitment during the PEEP decrease by observing the simultaneous changes in compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) [36]. For this purpose, Crs was calculated as the ratio of tidal volume (Vt) over the driving pressure (plateau pressure\u2014PEEP).",

Moreover, the few available studies did not specifically investigate the artefact that may affect the TPTD estimation of PEEP-induced changes in EVLW [6\u20138, 28]. As a matter of fact, by relieving the hypoxic vasoconstriction in recruited areas, PEEP may allow the cold indicator to reach these regions, increasing the volume of EVLW that is accessible to measurement. In our study, the changes in EVLW were the same among patients with high or low derecruitment, when derecruitment was assessed by the PEEP-induced change in lung volume, the method that is today the best one for estimating recruitment/derecruitment at the bedside [36]. It was also the same in the whole population, when we defined derecruitment as a decrease in Crs. Moreover, neither the estimated derecruited lung volume nor the Crs changes were independently associated with EVLW changes at linear mixed model analysis.",

In theory, three mechanisms might explain why EVLW varies in the same direction as PEEP (Additional file 3: Figure S1). First, decreasing PEEP decreases CVP, which is the backward pressure of the drainage through the thoracic duct. This may happen by direct transmission of the intrathoracic pressure to the right atrial pressure, or as the result of the decrease in the right ventricular afterload. Although the changes in EVLW were of lower amplitude than those of CVP, the results of the linear mixed effect model make this pathophysiological hypothesis acceptable. Of note, even though it may increase CVP in ARDS patients [48, 49], prone position in our population was not an element influencing the relationship between CVP and EVLW.",

It is well known that, on the opposite, augmenting PEEP increases the intramural pulmonary artery occlusion pressure [50].

Moreover, the estimation of pulmonary lymphatic flow in humans comes from animal studies, and it is much of an assumption that lymph flow is the same per kilogram of bodyweight in humans as in dogs [51]. Then, this is compatible with the amount of changes in EVLW we observed. The PEEP decrease led to a reduction of EVLW by 1.6 \u00b1 1.6 mL/kg, which was equivalent to roughly 100 mL of lung water accumulated in 15 min, and vice versa when PEEP was re-increased.

Moreover, it would have been impossible to avoid confounding events (changes in ventilatory setting and fluid administration or removal) over longer periods. Second, we estimated the derecruited volume during the PEEP decrease and not the recruited volume during the PEEP re-increase. Indeed, we speculated that derecruitment may occur faster than recruitment and be easier to detect [34]. Third, we directly measured the PEEP-induced changes in lung volume in 30 patients only, though it is the best method to estimate lung recruitment or derecruitment at the bedside. Estimating derecruitment through changes in Crs, as we did in the whole population, has many limitations [36]. Fourth, the number of saline boluses required for averaging EVLW measurements may have provoked fluid-induced changes in EVLW. However, the fact that EVLW decreased at the first study step indicates that this limitation probably had a very small impact. Fifth, because this was a human study, we could not directly measure the lymphatic flow, a procedure that could have strengthened our conclusions. Finally, we did not insert either a pulmonary artery catheter or an oesophageal balloon and thus could not estimate the hydrostatic lung filtration pressure and the transmural pressure. We thus cannot exclude that changing PEEP also changed the degree of pulmonary oedema formation.",
