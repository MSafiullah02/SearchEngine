Others have obtained similar results for an association between preterm birth and wheezing. 7 Another meta-analysis 8 suggests that caesarean section, a procedure often done for women with pre-eclampsia, is also associated with a 20% increased risk of asthma.",

            "text": "Finally, asthma in early life might be linked to the subsequent development of COPD. Most patients with COPD also have features of asthma, and diff erentiation between the two disorders is often diffi cult. This issue has been highlighted in many reports in the past 2 years and has been comprehensively reviewed by Postma and Rabe. 9 Patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) are usually excluded from clinical trials and, depending on their clinical features, might be misdiagnosed and given incorrect treatment. The Dutch hypothesis, originally suggested by Orie, 10 stated that diff erentiation of asthma from COPD in adults depends on clinical expression as modifi ed by age, sex, and the environment (eg, infection and smoking). Postma and colleagues 11 have updated this hypothesis in modern terms. Full clinical phenotyping, as suggested by Orie, is still extremely valuable. Rather than simply labelling patients as having asthma, COPD, or ACOS, they should be fully characterised with genomics and systems biology approaches. Ultimately, such approaches will be necessary to clearly distinguish between these two disorders, fully understand their unique aspects and their overlap, and defi ne new treatments. 12 Dietary modifi ers of fetal development hold the key to prevention of asthma and other complex diseases, and the application of systems biology approaches to multiomic data will also be needed to fully understand the biochemistry of disease development.

As a result, we remain without a licensed therapy for this disabling disease. 1 No such large phase 3 studies have been reported in 2015, and we await results of major trials of inhaled antibiotics, which are due to be reported in 2016.

            "text": "Identifi cation of the underlying cause of bronchiectasis is crucial for ongoing management. A cohort study of 1258 patients from six European countries reported that the frequency of idiopathic disease was 18-58%, while that of disease with a post-infective cause ranged from 5% to 43%. 2 164 (13%) patients had an underlying cause that required a specifi c treatment. Clear geographical variations in disease cause were noted, but there was no association between underlying cause and severity, suggesting that all patients with bronchiectasis need to undergo protocolised testing for cause of disease. 2 Geographical variation in the cause of bronchiectasis is even more marked outside Europe, with up to 60% of patients in the USA having disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which is less common in Europe (2-9% of patients in some reports). 2 In 2015, several small translational studies have added to our understanding of disease mechanisms. One of these is Szymanski and colleagues' whole-exome sequencing study 3 of 69 patients with pulmonary NTM infection and bronchiectasis, and 18 of their unaff ected family members. The investigators reported a high frequency of mitral valve prolapse, pectus excavatum, and joint hypermobility in these patients, and that these features were associated with several immune genes (eg, STAT1, IRF8, CARD9, CLEC4D, and MPEG1) and cilia genes, and with the cystic fi brosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This fi nding suggests that NTM-associated bronchiectasis might have a characteristic morphology and genetic susceptibility, but large studies in diverse populations are needed. 3 Frequent and severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis are both independently associated with mortality. 4 Gao and colleagues 5 identifi ed respiratory viruses in a large proportion of exacerbations. Viruses-most frequently coronaviruses, rhinovirus, and infl uenza A/B viruses-were identifi ed in 49 of 100 exacerbations (in 58 patients). Although many bronchiectasis exacerbations might have a viral cause, viruses were detected in 11 (19%) patients when they were clinically stable, suggesting that viral carriage or delayed viral clearance could be a factor leading to exacerbations. 5 Bronchiectasis is characterised by airway neutrophilia, a form of infl ammation that is relatively resistant to existing therapies like inhaled corticosteroids. 6 The chemokine receptor CXCR2 is expressed on neutrophils, and antagonism of CXCR2 can reduce neutrophil recruitment to the lung. A phase 2A proof-of-concept study of AZD5069, a CXCR2 antagonist, has been performed in 52 patients with bronchiectasis. 6 Sputum neutrophil count was decreased by 38% in the active treatment group compared with placebo. Surprisingly, this decrease was associated with an increase in the concentrations of some sputum and serum cytokines, and did not result in a reduction in exacerbations. 6 Larger studies are needed, since this trial was not powered to detect clinical benefi ts.",

They called for a coordinated eff ort to stimulate further research and highlight the need for better clinical trial endpoints. 8 A major step towards achieving this goal was taken in 2015 with the launch of a \u20ac50 million programme of work across Europe. Led by Stuart Elborn from Queen's University Belfast, UK, this EU-funded programme represents the largest investment in bronchiectasis research worldwide, and it aims to develop two new inhaled antibiotics for bronchiectasis. 9 The programme will also address challenges in drug development through validation of new clinical trial endpoints, including LCI, sputum biomarkers, and microbiome characterisation. 9 Moreover, the programme will provide long-term support for the European Bronchiectasis Registry (EMBARC), which began recruitment in February, 2015, and aims to gather data from up to 10 000 patients across Europe while building a sustainable framework for future multicentre clinical trials.",

As a heterogeneous disease with few disease-altering therapies it presents a complex challenge. Several studies published in 2015 have substantially contributed to our understanding of the disease process and its treatment modalities.COPD has long been thought to be caused by a rapid decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV\u2081) as a result of lung damage. Although cigarette smoking is the predominant and most common cause of disease development, environmental pollution, ageing, recurrent respiratory illnesses and infections, and genetic factors have all been reported as important contributors. Using three independent cohorts (the Framingham Offspring Cohort, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, and the Lovelace Smokers Cohort), Lange and colleagues 1 showed that decreased baseline airflow in young adulthood (age <40 years), along with normal rates of decline in FEV\u2081 (<40 mL per year), can result in development of grade 2 COPD or higher, as defined by the Global Initiative for",
