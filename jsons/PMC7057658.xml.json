In burn patients, potential biomarkers can be used clinically to identify infections and sepsis; they can also be used to predict the survival of injuries, monitor the severity of injuries, organ function or wound healing. There are several risk factors which facilitate microbial colonization and infection, including age and comorbidities, burn wound size, impaired immunity (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypermetabolic response), and medical measures (e.g., use of invasive catheters, transfusion, delays in burn wound excision) etc. [1, 2]. The microbial colonizers or pathogens affecting burn patients include bacteria and fungi [3, 4]. The most common Gram-positive bacteria implicated in burn wound infections include Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group A. Among that group, Staphylococcus aureus continues to be one of the most important bacterial cause of burn wound infections [4\u20137]. The most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria from patients with burn wounds include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae [1, 2, 5, 7, 8].",

The care and treatment of these patients have been quite challenging. If some of the infection control measures are neglected, these pathogens may even cause an outbreak in burn units [3, 10].

One sudden dust (flammable starch-based powder) explosive event occurred at a recreational water park in northern Taiwan. More than 4000 young attendees went to the music party where the incident happened on stage. As a result, 499 people were injured, 393 were hospitalized and 221 of them ended up in the intensive care units (ICUs) of 46 hospitals in seven cities. As most attendees wore flammable swimwear, the patients had large total body surface area (TBSA, average 41%) of burns. A total of 281 people suffered more than 40% injuries; of those, 41 victims were severely injured with TBSA more than 80%, and 15 fatalities were attributed to the explosion [18]. Among the hospitalized, 44 patients with similar age group and exposure levels were enrolled in the study.",

Culturing of pathogens was performed when the patient had a temperature over 38 \u00b0C or a fever of unknown etiology, exudates or pus from an insertion site or surgical site, or signs and symptoms of suspected infections. The microbial culture of burn wounds was judged by the physician for the degree of the wound dirty and the signs or symptoms of infection. Specimens of a burn wound were usually collected after the wound has been cleaned during the patient\u2019s operation. Microbiological work was carried out in a microbiology laboratory that was certified internationally through the College of American Pathologists. Identification of all microbial isolates was confirmed at the laboratory using automated-method employing identification cards of VITEK-MS system (BioMerieux Inc., Mercy L\u2019etoil, France). The susceptibility results were interpreted based on the criteria specified by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2015. Cultures reported with intermediate sensitivity were considered resistant.",

Our data displayed that in all types of ICU, the IRAB BSIs of burn CU increased during the first month after hospitalization. The TBSA in those cases ranged from 67 to > 90%, and those infections occurred 6\u201317 days after admission. More information might be provided if molecular epidemiological surveillance was available. However, the overall data from our study showed that the incidence of A. baumannii isolates resistant to carbapenem was relatively low, and the result was similar to the incidence of CRABs (21%) reported by two similar groups, but treated in different hospitals [23, 24].

Due to the fact that subjects in this study belonged to a young and homogeneous group, of particular interest to us was the influence of both burn severity and time factor on the types of microbial isolates. Several multivariate analyses of prospective or retrospective studies have revealed that the degree of burn wounds was a major risk factor for microbial colonization and infection [1, 5, 7, 26]. Compared to \u226419% of TBSA, patients with greater than 20% of TBSA were more than twice (RR 2.09\u20132.41) likely to be infected at a rate that was five times faster [7]. Several studies revealed that patients with TBSA range greater than 25% or greater than 30% had a high risk of microbial infection, because these patients usually need to use invasive devices for treatment [4, 26]. One report suggested that infection rates rose by an increase in TBSA of burn; they observed infection rates of 18, 30 and 52% in patients with 15\u201330%, 31\u201350% and 51\u201369% of TBSA respectively [5]. In the present study, patients with severe burns cases had the average TBSA of 46.1%; however, infection rates for patients with greater than 50% TBSA rose by 56.8%.",

We found an upward trend (p < 0.001) in the proportion of overall microbial isolates over time, until the TBSA reached 79%. Afterwards, the trend stabilized followed by a decline. In general, the risk of death of patients with severe burns was relatively high and rapid, so overall isolated microbial maybe thereby reduced. However, our data could not confirm this statement due to death in only one case (70% TBSA). In terms of the overall MDRO, we also used regression analyses approach to adjust the depth of burns, the likelihood of infections by MDRO increased by 2.58\u201317.57 times for each 10% increase in TBSA.",

One report indicated that the third-degree burns would significantly influence (HR 7.88) the burn wound infection. They concluded that risk of infection for patients with third-degree burns almost doubled and patients got infected at a faster rate [7]. Another study using multiple analysis revealed that only the third-degree burn (OR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.02\u20131.19, p = 0.012) was an independent risk factor [23]. Using univariable analysis, our results demonstrated significantly higher likelihood of MDRO infections (1.14\u20131.79 times) for every 10% increase in the third-degree burn severity. However, when the multiple analyses were used after adjusted TBSA variable, the risk of MDRO was reduced by 47\u201374%. This may be linked to early excision, debridement and grafting, use special materials dressings to treatment, as well as appropriate antibiotic use and infection control, which could reduce the risk of MDRO and cross-contamination in patients with deep burns.",

Recently one study showed that the overwhelming majority of bloodstream pathogens were GNB isolates typically isolated within 2 weeks after the burn. During 15\u201328 days after burn, A. baumannii was the most common causative pathogen, while Chryseobacterium spp., S. maltophilia, and R. mannitolilytica were most frequently isolated early (mean: 14.5 days) after the burn [24]. The proportion of the overall microbial isolates in this study showed a significant change in trend over time; in particular, hospitalization for more than 14 days (OR 4.5\u20139.8, p < 0.001). Our findings correlated well with previous studies with reference to isolation of GPBs; nearly a half of them (only 4 strains) were isolated within 3 days of hospitalization, before showing downward trend (p < 0.001). Although there was no statistically significant difference in the trend for the proportion of GNFGNB isolation (p = 0.299), with Acinetobacter spp. (71.4%) and P. aeruginosa (84.8%) being two major groups isolated at 15 or more days after hospitalization.",

The cases had homogeneity including patient age, medical treatment and care, and environmental setting factors. Therefore, our results successfully demonstrated the trends in microbial isolation and important factors that govern the rate of isolation. Second, the dispersion of the patients in different 5 ICUs and burn ward might cause some heterogeneity of the sampling. However, an interdisciplinary medical team was quickly established and held regular meetings on treatment and disposal strategies to achieve consensus and consistency. Third, this manuscript was mainly based on recommended of the US CDC\u2019s definition of burn infection, including changes in the appearance or characteristics of burn wound. Burn injury could result in severe sepsis and septic shock; however, our database could not display the data.",
