Although EF1a showed stable expression in both tissues and developmental stages, it had the least stability in insects fed on resistant and susceptible host plants.

The requirement of optimal number of HKGs can be obtained from the pairwise variation (V), wherein Vandosomplele et al. (2002) proposed a cut-off value (0.15), below which the inclusion of other reference genes are not required. Results in the current study showed that the application of at least two stable reference genes maintains proper normalization irrespective of treatment, tissue, and development stages\u00d5 samples (Fig. 3A\u00d0C, respectively) . Because the pairwise variation was calculated by adding candidate genes stepwise according to rankings shown in Fig. 2 , two of the most stable genes identi\u00deed for a particular experimental condition (Fig. 2) should be able to be combined for normalization. The candidate genes having lower stability in a given treatment (Fig. 2) should be avoided for normalization even if it is to be used in combination with other reference gene given the suitability and availability of other reference genes. For example, GeNorm analysis suggests that for qRT-PCR normalization in A. glycines fed with resistant and susceptible soybean, both TBP and RPS9 could be used together. Similarly, for normalization among different developmental stages and among tissues of A. glycines, TBP and EF1a could be combined. It is interesting to note that various HKGs (RPS9, GAPDH, HEL, and UBQ) were not consistently ranked in terms of their stability under different experimental conditions, that is also the case observed in other insect studies (Hiel et al. 2009 , Hornakova et al. 2010 , Jiang et al. 2010 , Lord et al. 2010 ). Therefore, care should be taken in determining which HKG to use depending on experimental conditions. NormFinder Analysis. NormFinder showed similar results to GeNorm, wherein TBP was shown to have low stability value (lower variation of gene expression) across all the samples (Fig. 4) , further indicating the potential for this gene as a HKG for gene expression studies in A. glycines. Although there are discrep- ancies between the GeNorm and Norm\u00dender output, TBP was shown to be the best ranking reference gene with both methods among treatments, tissues, and developmental stages ( Fig. 2 and 4) .
