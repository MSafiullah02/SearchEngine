Despite a common coping strategy for mass casualty (earthquake and blast injury) in China, SARI epidemic has proposed a new challenge for healthcare workers, especially intensivists. About 15\u201320% of suspected and confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics developed severe hypoxemia (since the second week of disease course), and required some form of ventilatory support such as high-flow nasal cannula, and non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, other complications might occur, including, but not limited to, shock, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis. No antiviral agents have been proven to be effective against the coronavirus. Therefore, management of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection still remains supportive rather than definitive, indicating remarkable workload for intensive care physicians and nurses. This surge of critically ill patients in designated hospitals as well as fever clinics represents urgent demands for intensive care with regards to space, supplies, and staff (Table 1) [5\u20138]. Response to these demands requires cooperation between the medical rescue team, infection control specialists, local health authorities, and center for disease control and prevention [9].",

Potential benefits of centralized provision of intensive care might include better and more efficient utilization of scarce resources, and improved clinical outcome [10]. However, these benefits should be balanced against the risk of inter-hospital transfer, delay in access to intensive care, and de-skilling of staff in other designated hospitals [10]. In addition, intensivists are also involved in the inter-hospital transfer such as design of transfer plan, patient screening and evaluation, and escort of patients.",

As part of the national response to inadequate local intensive care resources, 31 deployed support medical teams including 598 intensivists and 2319 ICU nurses from other cities have been dispatched to ICUs of the designated hospitals since early January 2020. However, it is not uncommon for them to spend some time to get familiar with colleagues, environment, and local hospital administration before working as a team. Furthermore, different personal experience and lack of knowledge of this novel disease often result in different, and sometimes conflicting, treatment plans within the same team. Therefore, a national intensive care expert team has been developed, with some experts working in ICUs as attendings, while other more senior experts make regular inspections of all hospitals and fever clinics with critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing consultation for some difficult cases, discussing strengths and weaknesses of the patient management strategy, and providing suggestions to the national and local health authorities. In addition, the volume of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has surpassed the intensive care supply for quite a long period of time, meaning that only a small proportion of critically ill patients could get access to intensive care services. Under these circumstances, patient triage and provision of essential rather than limitless intensive care would be very important [7].",
