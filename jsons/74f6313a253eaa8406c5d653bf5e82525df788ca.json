It has been hypothesized that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might suffer from cytokine storm [11] . It is, therefore, more likely that impaired immune system in HIV patients reduces the frequency of cytokine storm. Alternatively, the lower disease rates among higher risk groups is due to a lower threshold for testing in these populations or an increased adherence to social distance among those with known immunocompromising diseases. Information on what percentage of the patients with cancer were being treated with immune suppressive therapy is therefore critical but lacking at this point. In addition, data on lymphocyte count, plasma CRP, IL-6 and TNF was not available when our data were compiled and is being actively collected.
