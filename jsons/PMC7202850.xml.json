Pollution emissions from the transportation and industrial sectors were expected to decrease, and the following questions can be asked: Did the air quality improve during the control of Covid-19? If so, how was the improvement related to the reduced emissions from these two sectors? Also, what was the major cause for the improvements in air quality and which atmospheric species were most affected? Answering these questions is a way to evaluate the influences of traffic and industrial emissions on air quality during winter in China. The results of the evaluation can then be used to make recommendations regarding air pollution control during winter in China.",

During the control period, a series of measures was undertaken to reduce gatherings of people (China State Council, 2020). Specifically, all non-essential factories were shut down, and schools were closed as were all entertainment venues and restaurants. A dramatic reduction in road traffic was observed during the control period. For example, the flow of commercial trucks and buses in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding areas decreased by 77% and 39%, respectively, during the control period (MEP, 2020).",

The AQI averaged over all stations decreased by 20%, from 89.6 before the control period for Covid-19 to 71.6 during the controls (Fig. 2\n), demonstrating an overall improvement in air quality from the control measures. A total of 322 of the 366 cities studied experienced a decline in the AQI. The highest AQI reductions occurred in the Ningxia, Shandong, and Henan Provinces (Fig. S1), which normally have high numbers of vehicles in use (Shandong and Henan) (Fig. S2a) and many secondary industries in operation (Ningxia, Shandong, and Henan) (Fig. S2b). The lowest AQI reductions occurred in the Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hainan Provinces (Fig. S1), where motor vehicle usage and secondary industries are relatively low (Fig. S2). Therefore, the improvement of air quality apparently was related to the number of motor vehicles in use and the percentages of secondary industries in each province. The AQI in 366 urban areas had the highest correlation coefficient (r2 of 0.99) with the PM2.5 before and during the control of Covid-19, which reflects the fact that fine particles were the major air pollutant throughout the study.",

A total of 331 (309, 366) of the 366 cities studied experienced reductions in CO (SO2, NO2). The highest reductions of CO and NO2 occurred in the Shandong and Henan Provinces (Figs. 3\n, S5) where there are large numbers of motor vehicles and many secondary industries (Fig. S2). This suggests that the reduced emissions from the transportation and industrial sectors were what caused the concentrations of these two gases to decrease. The largest decreases in SO2 were found in Shanxi and Jiangxi Provinces (Fig. 4\n), which have low numbers of vehicles but many secondary industries (Fig. S2). This indicates that the reduced SO2 concentration was probably caused by the lower emissions from secondary industries during the control period.",

The SO2/NO2 ratio is an indicator of the relative contributions of air pollutants from stationary versus mobile sources (Aneja et al., 2001), and higher values occur when there are greater influences from stationary sources. The SO2/NO2 ratio averaged over the two sets of samples increased from 0.39 to 0.70 after the controls were in place (Fig. S6), suggesting an increase in the relative importance of stationary sources (Song et al., 2017). The AVCs for PM2.5 and PM10 were \u221221% and \u221227%, respectively (Fig. S3), and the PM2.5/PM10 ratio increased from 0.76 to 0.82 (Fig. S6); these are signs of either decreased impacts from dust sources or enhanced secondary aerosol formation during the Covid-19 control period (Song et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018).",

Therefore, the reduction in the PM2.5 is best explained by lower emissions from the transportation and industrial sector. The reduced NO2 concentrations were positively correlated with both vehicle numbers (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.001; Fig. 6) and industrial NOx emissions (R2 = 0.36, p < 0.01; Fig. 6), indicating that decreased emissions from both the transportation and industrial sectors led to improvements in NO2. As the reduced NO2 concentrations were more strongly correlated with vehicle population than with the industrial NOx emissions, transportation probably was more responsible for the decrease in NO2 concentrations. The SO2 concentrations showed a significant positive relationship with industrial SO2 emissions (R2 = 0.16, p < 0.1; Fig. 6) but not with motor vehicle numbers. Therefore, the reduced SO2 concentrations were only linked to the industrial sector. The CO concentrations showed a significant positive correlation with both the vehicle numbers (R2 = 0.17, p < 0.05; Fig. 6) and percentages of secondary industries (R2 = 0.29, p < 0.01; Fig. 6), but the stronger correlation with the latter (Fig. 6) suggests a reduction in industrial emissions was more responsible for the decrease.",

However, increasingly stringent emission standards, electric vehicle subsidies, and the promotion and development of the public transportation have limited the impacts from mobile emissions (Wu et al., 2017). In fact, those measures have prevented increases in the vehicular emissions of air pollutants (except for NOx) since 2010 (Wu et al., 2017).

Yes, the overall air quality improved: the AQI decreased from 89.6 prior to the control period to 71.6 during the control period. In fact, a large majority (322 of 366) of the cities studied experienced a decline in the AQI. The concentrations of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2) decreased during the control period for Covid-19, but O3 did not decrease.",

Lower emissions from motor vehicles and secondary industries most likely were responsible for the observed decreases in PM2.5, NO2, and CO concentrations during the control period. Lower emissions from the transportation sector were the main cause for NO2 reduction, while the industrial sector was responsible for the PM2.5 and CO reductions. The reduction in SO2 was only related to reduced emissions from the industrial sector.",

Despite restrictions placed on motor vehicles and secondary industries during the control period, air pollution continued to be problematic in large parts of northern China. The concentrations of O3 actually increased during the control period, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO2 and as a result greater O3 production. These results illustrate the importance of reactions that can occur between gaseous and particulate pollutants, but clearly, lowering the emissions of both NOx and VOCs will be needed to control O3. Results of our study highlight the importance of emissions from the residential sector for wintertime pollution in northern China, and they show that this source must be taken into account in developing pollution mitigation plans.",
