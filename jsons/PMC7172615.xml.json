However, production of complete immunoglobulins (Igs) turned out to be extremely difficult, given their structural complexity. This fact directed interest to the production of small Ab fragments that retain full antigen-binding capacity, a strategy that yielded the first successful reports of active Fab (antigen-binding fragment of antibodies composed of heterodimer VH\u2013CH1/VL\u2013CL) and single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments expressed in the periplasm of E. coli in the late 1980s. These studies were followed by the cloning of large repertoires of scFv and Fab genes in phage or phagemid vectors, allowing the display of these recombinant antibodies (rAbs) on the capsid of filamentous phage. Phage display permits the in vitro selection of clones with distinct antigen-binding specificities in a process named biopanning, which mimics the clonal expansion of B cells in vivo (Figure 1\n).",

The generation of large combinatorial libraries of Fabs and scFvs, the engineering of selected clones to improve their binding and stability properties, and the design of new systems for their expression in different bacterial hosts, cellular compartments and protein formats (e.g. bivalent and multivalent molecules, diabodies, etc.) have been the major areas of investigation. The search for even smaller rAb fragments has led to the use of single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), based on natural V domains from heavy-chain-only Abs (e.g. VHH camelbodies) or engineered VH or VL domains with autonomous antigen-binding activity. Other antigen-binding fragments have been constructed using the rational design of binding capacities in small protein scaffolds, not based on Ig domains, and these are generally referred to as affibodies (Afs).",

A recent study using a non-immune human scFv library [16\u2022] has clearly shown that phage vectors allow higher display levels and make biopanning more efficient (i.e. greater numbers of binders are isolated in fewer rounds). The reason for these differences stems from the need for a helper phage (e.g. VCS-M13 or M13KO7) for rescue of phagemid vectors (Figure 2\n). Wild-type pIII, encoded by the helper phage, is packaged more efficiently than scFv\u2013pIII fusions encoded by phagemids. As a result, phagemid virions contain none or a single copy of the scFv\u2013pIII hybrid, whereas several copies can be packaged in phage virions.",

In the case of Fabs, multivalency is difficult to achieve even with phage vectors owing to their larger size (proteolysis of the Fab fusion generates wild-type pIII that is packaged in the virion).

Compared with other M13\u2013pIII mutants 23., 24., the new helpers appear to be more stable and produce higher titers of rescued phagemids. These mutant helper phages can also be extremely useful for the selective infection of phage (SIP) [25].

Autotransporters comprise a large family of proteins secreted by Gram-negative bacteria. They are characterized by a C-terminal domain that inserts into the outer membrane and assembles into an oligomeric complex with a 2 nm hydrophilic pore through which the N-domain of the protein is translocated [30]. By substituting the natural protease N-domain of the IgA protease from Neisseria gonorroheae (an autotransporter) with different scFvs, VHH domains, and strings of two or three VHH domains, it has been shown that stable scFvs and VHH can be displayed on the surface of E. coli cells with efficiencies close to 100% [29\u2022\u2022]. Using this expression system it was also shown that E. coli cells displaying an scFv against enteric coronaviruses were able to act as delivery vehicles of passive immunity capable of neutralizing the infection of mammalian cells cultured in vitro\n[31].",

Alternatively, shortening the length of the linker peptide connecting the VH\u2013VL domains in scFvs generates diabodies (scFv dimers), triabodies and tetrabodies, with mono- bi- tri- or tetra-antigen specificities (reviewed in [57]). Bivalent dimeric and bi-specific camel sdAbs have also been produced by fusing two VHH domains with a natural hinge peptide [58].

Another important protein modification is biotinylation. scFvs can be biotinylated in vivo in the cytoplasm of E. coli trxB gor cells with very high efficiencies (>90% of the total scFv produced) [49\u2022]. This has been achieved by fusion of the scFv to the 89 amino acid C-domain of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein, a substrate of the endogenous E. coli biotin ligase.

            "text": "Two Af libraries have been constructed based on ankyrin repeats (AnkR) as protein scaffolds 69.\u2022\u2022, 70.. AnkR proteins are composed of several 33 amino acid repeats stacked in a row, each repeat comprising a \u03b2-turn followed by two antiparallel \u03b1 helices and a C-terminal loop [71]. The AnkR proteins are found in organisms from all phyla and can be located in the cytoplasm, anchored to membranes or secreted to the extracellular space. The strategy to generate the AnkR Af libraries was based on the design of a synthetic AnkR consensus sequence, derived from natural AnkR sequences, with randomized amino acid positions at the \u03b2-turn and the short hinge connecting the two \u03b1 helices. This AnkR module was repeated two or three times, depending on the specific library, and the fusion proteins were flanked at their N and C termini with capping AnkR of defined sequence [69\u2022\u2022]. The AnkR Afs were highly stable, soluble and accumulated in the cytoplasm of E. coli at high concentrations (yields averaged 200 mg/L of culture in shake flasks). More importantly, high-affinity binders (KD in the nanomolar range) against different protein targets (e.g. MBP) were selected from these libraries using ribosomal display (a powerful technique for the selection of binders directly from an in vitro transcription-translation reaction 72., 73.). The same report also showed a co-crystal of MBP with its binder AnkR Af, revealing the interaction surface between these two molecules. The three-dimensional X-ray structure of the MBP\u2013Af complex showed the randomized amino acids of the AnkRs forming a concave surface contacting MBP and covering \u223c600 \u00c52 of its surface, which is only slightly smaller than the surface covered in antigen\u2013antibody complexes (777 \u00b1 135 \u00c52) [74]. Given the extraordinary properties of AnkR Afs (e.g. high solubility, affinity, flexible modularity, absence of disulfide bonds, etc.), these Afs may be suited not only for in vitro applications (e.g. affinity purification, protein co-crystallization and protein chips), but might also have a role as intracellular inhibitors of specific processes in vivo.",

Gene libraries of rAbs or Afs, cloned in phage or phagemid vectors, can be rescued in phage particles displaying the corresponding rAb or Af on their capsids. This allows the specific binding of phage particles displaying rAb and Af binders to a given immobilized antigen, for example, on a solid surface (other strategies have also been developed [77]). Elution of bound phages, and their amplification by re-infecting E. coli cells, permits their clonal expansion. After a few rounds of panning (including phage binding, elution and amplification), the binding activity of individual clones can be screened by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on microtiter plates.",

Phagemid DNA (navy blue circle) is packed as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA, navy blue solid line) into capsids of filamentous phage (light blue rod) composed of the major coat protein pVIII and some minor coat proteins like pIII. Capsid proteins (e.g. pVIII, pIII) and other phage proteins required for packaging, such as pV (a ssDNA-binding protein) and pIV an outer membrane (OM) secretin, are encoded by the DNA of a standard helper phage (light blue circle). Wild-type pIII and pIII fusions, encoded by phagemids, insert into the inner membrane (IM) before assembly into the terminal tip of a filamentous virion (3\u20135 copies/virion). Usually, wild-type pIII is packaged more efficiently than the pIII fusion, which are found in a single copy per virion unless a M13\u0394pIII helper phage is used for rescue.",

Periplasmic chaperones (e.g. DsbA and FkpA) fold the Ig domains or rAbs using this expression strategy. When fused to a C-terminal autotransporter domain (AT), these rAbs can be redirected to the outer membrane (OM) and become exposed at the surface of the bacteria. Alternatively, rAbs devoid of Sec signal peptides can be expressed in a functional form in the cytoplasm of E. coli trxB gor mutant strains. Cytoplasmic co-expression of signal sequence-less (\u0394ss) derivatives of periplasmic chaperones (e.g. DsbC or Skp) assist in many cases the folding of the cytoplasmic rAbs. In addition, rAbs can be secreted toward the extracellular medium, directly from the cytoplasm, by fusion with a C-terminal secretion signal from E. coli \u03b1-hemolysin (HlyA) and its type I transporter (TolC-HlyB-HlyD).
