Often, these mucosae are oversimplified as mere physical barriers; however, their molecular composition, consisting of intricate glycan structures (see Glossary) on secreted proteins and lipids, provides many additional immunological functions 3, 4. The large diversity of glycans that can be displayed by mucosal surfaces are determined both by inherited variation [5] and transcriptional regulation within epithelial cells [6]. Importantly, interindividual variation in the types of glycan present on mucosal surfaces is a major contributor to differences in susceptibility to a variety of infections 3, 5, 7, 8. Indeed, the contribution of mucosal glycans to infection susceptibility has gained much recent interest, owing to studies that have provided mechanistic insight into their function 9, 10, 11.",

            "text": "Mucosal constituents that are decorated with glycans are formed through a process mediated by a diverse family of glycosyltransferase enzymes, mostly acting in a template-independent manner [12]. FUT2 encodes an \u03b1(1,2)-fucosyltransferase that is expressed in mucosal tissues by multiple epithelial cell types. FUT2 facilitates the attachment of the L-fucose monosaccharide to specific O-linked glycan chains, producing \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans 5, 8. This resulting \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycan is a highly versatile structure and can be further modified to form one of a number of clinically important glycans, including the A and B histo-blood group antigens on mucosal surfaces 5, 8. Mucosal histo-blood groups are analogous to those found on erythrocytes, although only those secreted by mucosal surfaces are dependent on FUT2. For example, an individual who has an A blood type will express A-type glycans on erythrocytes, but will only express A-type glycans on mucosal surfaces if they have a functional FUT2\n[5]. After the glycosylation process, \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated proteins and lipids are either secreted from mucosal epithelium into the lumen directly, or are anchored to the apical cell surface membrane. Because FUT2 controls the nature of the various \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans secreted by mucosal surfaces, it was termed the \u2018secretor\u2019 gene, although it does not regulate secretion per se\n[5].",

            "text": "As \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans act as important precursors for a range of mucosal glycans, the high frequency of nonsense SNPs within the FUT2 gene in humans [13] is perhaps surprising. In fact, approximately one-fifth of the global population harbour two nonfunctional alleles and are therefore unable to express \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans on mucosal surfaces 7, 13. While individuals with a functional FUT2 allele are termed \u2018secretors\u2019, those with loss-of-function mutations are termed \u2018nonsecretors\u2019. Interestingly, the frequency of nonsecretors varies substantially with ethnicity 7, 13, with a range of SNPs found to confer this nonsecretor phenotype. However, the widespread distribution of these traits indicates a conserved selective advantage for nonsecretors under certain circumstances [14] (Box 1\n). In addition to an absence of \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans in mucosal secretions, including the absence of histo-blood group antigens, nonsecretors also display increased levels of sialylated glycans in mucosal secretions [15], presumably as a result of reduced glycosyltransferase competition.Box 1FUT2 SNPs and Historical InfectionsMultiple SNPs, found in the FUT2 coding region, confer loss, or hindered function. The most common nonsense SNP in Caucasian, African, and central Asian populations is a G\u2192A substitution at base pair 428 (rs601338); however, the most common in east Asian populations is an A\u2192T substitution at base pair 385 (rs1047781) 7, 13. Both SNPs occur at similar frequencies in their respective populations, with estimates dating the emergence of the 428G\u2192A mutation to at least 1.87 million years ago and the 385A\u2192T mutation to at least 256 000 years ago [72]. The age and frequency of these mutations suggest that they are maintained in the gene pool by balancing selection, where both secretor and nonsecretor variants provide selective advantage. Available evidence suggests that differential resistance to infection is the driver of this balancing selection [14], although identification of the causative infective agent is speculative. However, this phenomenon has been observed outside of the human population, where infection-driven selection of glycosyltransferase variants was reported in a study of rabbit populations, where those with endemic rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus had glycosyltransferase SNPs at higher frequencies compared to populations without endemic virus [73].Alt-text: Box 1",

A large number of studies have now reported significantly higher rates of viral infection in secretors, including life-threatening infections caused by HIV, influenza, and norovirus 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. At the same time, secretors appear to be at a reduced risk of infections caused by bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 9, 11, 22, 23, 24. This dichotomy in susceptibility also extends to chronic multifactorial diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis [25], and diseases of altered immune regulation, such as asthma 26, 27, type 1 diabetes [28], and psoriasis [29]. It is important to note that while all of the studies listed in Table 1 reported significant associations between secretor status and disease, sample sizes and effect sizes vary.",

As has been reviewed in detail 30, 31, 32, multiple bacteria encode specific receptors that bind to host \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans for pathogen adherence. A well characterised example of this is in Helicobacter pylori, facilitated by the BabA adhesin. BabA has a specificity for the \u2018Lewis b\u2019 \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated mucosal glycan, therefore BabA-expressing H. pylori is more readily able to adhere to the gastric mucosa and colonize the stomachs of secretor individuals [33] (Figure 1\nA). BabA-encoding H. pylori and subsequent infection susceptibility is something of an exception, as this is the only bacterial species listed in Table 1 where susceptibility is increased in secretors (due to the specificity of BabA towards \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans). Two viruses have analogous receptors, norovirus (specifically strain GII.4) 34, 35 and rotavirus (specifically strains containing spike protein VP8) 36, 37. Both of these viruses encode different adhesins, specific to \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans. The absence of these glycans in nonsecretors therefore confers high levels of resistance 20, 21, 38 (Figure 1A).",

Glycosylated proteins and lipids are abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, either anchored to the cell surface, secreted into the lumen, or taken in through ingestion. Therefore, infection susceptibility, where pathogens adhere to glycans, depends on the location and anchoring of the glycan. Glycans that are not attached to the epithelium can, in fact, reduce infection susceptibility by acting as receptor decoys. For example, the cell surface mucin, MUC1, carries Lewis-b glycans and is shed from the surface of gastric epithelial cells acting as a releasable decoy to limit adhesion by BabA-expressing H. pylori to other cell surface Lewis-b-expressing molecules [39]. As a separate example, maternal secretor status affects glycosylation of glycoproteins in milk [40], and consequently maternal secretors reduce their infants\u2019 susceptibility to Campylobacter jejuni diarrhoea [41]. This has been attributed to C. jejuni binding to \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated milk glycans [42], which act as a receptor decoy in the infant, sequestering the pathogen away from the epithelium (Figure 1B). As these examples demonstrate, the dynamics of how glycan-mediated adherence (either membrane-bound or luminal) ultimately confers susceptibility or resistance to infection is complex.",

Even small changes to microbiota composition can alter nutrient availability, profoundly affecting the ability of bacterial pathogens to colonise the gut [43]. Beyond such \u2018colonisation resistance\u2019, murine studies have also shown that Fut2-dependent fucosylated glycans are an important endogenous nutrient for commensal microbes, facilitating rapid host recovery following periods of stress caused by intestinal infection or inflammation [9].

Particularly in the airways, mucus hydration is an important characteristic for mucociliary clearance 4, 54. Well-described examples of impaired clearance are evident in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis [4]. While this requires experimental validation, higher sialic acid levels in nonsecretor airways may affect mucus clearance mechanisms. Such a difference might explain the observed findings of a study in which infection by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, and echovirus were all lower in nonsecretors [19].

Many viruses also utilize host membranes for encapsulation. Several studies have demonstrated that viruses shed from epithelial cells displaying A or B glycans also display these glycans. Specifically, cell lines infected with HIV-1 [59] or measles virus [60] were found to produce viral particles coated in their specific blood group glycan (as depicted in Figure 2\n). While these studies were performed in vitro using transformed cell lines, they support a logical conclusion; viruses from a cell expressing particular glycosyltransferases carry a host-glycan fingerprint of this parent cell. Addition of anti-histo blood group NAbs was found to bind to these viruses and elicit antibody-mediated inactivation 59, 60. Further studies have investigated NAb-mediated viral neutralisation using other, analogous glycan structures, showing supporting results 61, 62. However, it is unlikely that nonsecretors develop NAbs with specificity to secretor glycans, as \u03b1(1,2)-fucosylated glycans exist in nonmucosal sites, which are not reliant on FUT2. Secretor status may however affect a virus\u2019s ability to evade host antibody defences. As FUT2 mediates the display of ABO histo-blood group antigens in mucosal secretions, viruses that come from a nonsecretor would not display blood group antigens and hence would not be affected by anti-histo blood group NAbs. Further infection models are required to elucidate the contribution of viral glycosylation to infection dynamics.",

We are now entering an era in which whole-genome sequencing is becoming increasingly common in both research (for large cohort studies) and at an individual level (as a predictive tool for risk susceptibility).

Developing stratification strategies based on glycosylation compatibility could therefore inform and reduce infection spread. At an individual level, identification of common genetic infection and disease risk factors, such as FUT2 SNPs, could inform and direct an individual\u2019s behaviour to minimise infection and disease risk, particularly when linked to other risk factors.

Respiratory- and gastrointestinal-associated diseases often have a direct microbial component, and many other seemingly unrelated chronic diseases are also associated with our interactions with microbes, including type 2 diabetes [64], asthma [65], and rheumatoid arthritis [66], to name but a few. Secretor status is associated not only with susceptibility to many of these chronic diseases, but also their progression and severity. This relationship could inform the stratification of patient populations and the prediction of adverse events. For example, stratification of patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis by secretor status identified that chronic airway infection, lung function, and pulmonary exacerbation frequency were higher in secretor individuals [67].",

Early-life antibiotic exposure or a dysregulated microbiota has been linked with allergen sensitisation [65]. Maternal secretor status is linked with infant microbiota composition 44, 69, and nonsecretors are more susceptible to asthma [26], psoriasis [29], and early-life IgE-associated eczema [70]. While it is essential that we better understand how the influence of glycan fucosylation on the microbiome contributes to the development of these conditions, such relationships might also present opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies. For example, might breast milk, supplemented with \u03b1(1,2)-fucose, reduce allergic disease susceptibility in at-risk infants? Oral supplementation with \u03b1(1,2)-fucose has been shown to be well tolerated and shift the intestinal microbiota in healthy adults [71], highlighting its safety and efficacy as a potential prebiotic.",

The effect of genetic variation in genes that mediate mucosal glycosylation, such as SNPs in FUT2, increases our understanding of immunology at a population level, and creates opportunities to implement effective precision medicine. Testing glycan-mediated mechanisms of infection and disease susceptibility is now warranted to assess their inclusion in clinical and policy practices. Ultimately, precision medicine requires an integrated decision-making model that encompasses extrinsic factors, including diet, mental and physical health, the microbiome, and intrinsic factors, such as human genetics and subsequent phenotypes. While testing population-level variability remains challenging [2], a better understanding of the factors by which glycans mediate disease susceptibility offers the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes.Outstanding QuestionsHow do the effects of secretor status on infection and disease susceptibility replicate across multiple studies?Does transcriptional regulation of FUT2 change during health, infection, and disease? Might this influence severity of infection and/or disease?Does ABO blood group type affect viral transmissibility?Are viral particles from nonsecretors better able to evade host NAb defences?With personal genome sequencing becoming increasingly common, might an individual\u2019s knowledge of their infection/disease susceptibility reduce incidence or late diagnosis?\n",
