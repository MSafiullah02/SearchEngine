As the evidence progresses, are these markers which we should be routinely be assessing in confirmed cases of COVID 19?",

In a recent and very small sample from Singapore,\n5\n it might appear that the virus has a relatively mild course in many affected patients, and that the faeco\u2010oral route as well as the more classic respiratory route of transmission may be a factor. These early observations appear to be supported by more robust data which imply that at the height of the China outbreak, some 36% of cases observed occurred in patients without previous clear exposure to the virus.\n6\n Based on these early data, it appears to be the case that it is increasingly likely that person to person spread of the virus responsible for COVID 19 becomes more common between apparently relatively unaffected people or those with only mild coryzal symptoms as the virus becomes endemic within communities. Does this raise questions for screening strategies, public health policy and front\u2010line clinical teams as the illness spreads within communities? In addition is it possible that published overall mortality rates may be overestimates as the true denominator (the total numbers with COVID\u201019) is unknown because of mild cases, perhaps especially among children and younger adults, not presenting for screening?",
