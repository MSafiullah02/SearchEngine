            "text": "With the explosive growth of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic age, scientists are anxious to know their attributes because they are closely correlated with the structures and functions of the proteins as well as their roles in biological processes, and hence are very important to both basic research and drug target development. For instance, given an uncharacterized protein sequence, what is its folding rate? Which structural class and quaternary structural attribute does it belong to? Which subcellular location site does it resides? Can it simultaneously exist in or move between two and more subcellular locations? How can we identify it as an enzyme or non-enzyme? If it is an enzyme, to which enzyme functional class does it belong? Is it a membrane protein or non-membrane protein? If the former, to which membrane protein type does it belong? Is it a protease? If it is, to which protease type does it belong? Is it a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)? If it is, to which GPCR type does it belong? Which part of the protein serves as its signal sequence? Where are its cleavage sites by proteases such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) protease and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) enzyme? And so forth. Although the answers to these questions can be determined by conducting various biochemical experiments, it is both time-consuming and costly by relying on experimental approaches alone. As a consequence, the gap between the number of newly discovered protein sequences and the knowledge of their attributes is continuing to expand. To bridge such a gap and acquire these kinds of information in a timely manner, scientists are challenged to develop computational methods for predicting various attributes of proteins based on their sequence information alone.",

The learning dataset is used for training the predictor's \u201cengine\u201d, while the testing dataset used for evaluating the predictor's accuracy via a cross-validation. As we can see from Eq. (2), none of the proteins in the testing dataset ST should occur in the learning dataset SL. Therefore, ST is also called an independent dataset for performing cross-validation. However, as will be shown later, there is no need to artificially separate the benchmark dataset into a learning dataset and a testing dataset when the cross-validation is performed by the jackknife test, in which case one benchmark dataset can serve both the training and testing purposes.",

(2003) and Chou and Cai (2002) based on the 2005 FunDs in the SBASE-A database (Murvai et al., 2001). Since then, a series of new protein FunD databases were established, such as COG (Tatusov et al., 2003), KOG (Tatusov et al., 2003), SMART (Letunic et al., 2006), Pfam (Finn et al., 2006), and CDD (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2007). Of these databases, CDD contains the domains imported from COG, Pfam, and SMART, and hence is relatively much more complete (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2007) and was adopted in most of the recent publications (see, e.g., Chou and Shen, 2010a, Chou and Shen, 2010c, Shen and Chou, 2009d). The version 2.11 of CDD contains 17,402 characteristic domains. Thus, when using the general formulation of PseAAC (Eq.

(9)), then the prediction should be carried out based on those proteins in the training set that can be defined in the exactly same 17402-D FunD space as well. If a query protein is defined in the 60020-D GO space (see Eq.

If the query protein in both the 17402-D FunD space and 60020-D GO space is a naught vector and hence must be defined instead in the sequential evolution space (see Eq.

This is because the more the stringent of a benchmark dataset in excluding homologous and high similarity sequences, the more the difficult for a predictor to achieve a high overall success rate (Chou and Shen, 2010a). Also, the more the number of subsets (attribute categories) a benchmark dataset covers, the more the difficult to achieve a high overall success rate. This can be easily conceivable via the following consideration. Suppose a benchmark dataset consists of two subsets (attribute categories) with each containing the same number of proteins. The overall success rate in identifying their attribute categories by random assignment would be 1/2=50%. However, for a benchmark dataset consisting of 20 subsets, the corresponding overall success rate by the random assignment would be 1/20=5%, which is only one-tenth of the former.",

This is because we are living in the Internet Age. To make a new prediction method really useful for the majority of people, it is an important direction or necessary procedure to provide a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-server for the method (Chou and Shen, 2009). Technically speaking, a web-server means a computer program that is responsible for accepting Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests from clients. By means of web-servers, many computational prediction methods, regardless how difficult their mathematics or how complicated their algorithms are, can be easily used by the vast majority of scientists to generate their desired data without the need to understand the mathematical details.",

Many studies from various research laboratories around the world have indicated that mathematical analysis, computational modeling, and introducing novel physical concept to biology and medicine, such as graphical analysis (Andraos, 2008, Myers and Palmer, 1985, Zhou and Deng, 1984), modeling three-dimensional structures of targeted proteins/peptides for drug design (Sharma et al., 2008, Zhou and Troy, 2003, Zhou and Troy, 2005a, Zhou and Troy, 2005b, Zhou et al., 2004), diffusion-controlled reaction simulation (Zhou et al., 1981, Zhou and Zhong, 1982, Zhou et al., 1983), cellular responding kinetics (Qi et al., 2007), and biological functions of solitons in DNA (Zhou, 1989) can provide useful insights for both basic research and drug design and hence are widely welcome by science community. In view of this, it is highly desirable to develop automated methods by introducing new concepts and approaches for fast and accurately predicting the attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. During the past two decades or so, many statistical methods for predicting various protein attributes have been proposed. In this review, the key steps for establishing a powerful predictor in this regard have been analyzed in hopes that the points raised here may help stimulate the further development of new and more powerful predictors in this area. It is anticipated that the general form of PseAAC as formulated in this review may further stimulate the efforts to find various new modes of optimal PseAAC, which is one of the most important future directions we should focus on in order to substantially improve the power of predicting protein attributes.",
