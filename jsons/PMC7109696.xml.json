Being under permanent pressure to escape from the defense mechanisms of the cell and at the same time driven by an essential requirement to ensure optimal conditions for efficient and selective replication, viruses are forced to continuously co-evolve with the host by adapting various properties and mechanisms, often uncommon to cellular organisms (Domingo, 2005; Firth and Brierley, 2012; Gale et al., 2000; Gibbs et al., 2005; Holmes and Drummond, 2007; L\u00f3pez-Lastra et al., 2010). These mechanisms can involve the recruitment and/or modification of cellular factors, but are also inherent in the nucleotide composition of the viral genomic sequences themselves. In particular, viral genomes, and specifically coding regions, not only determine protein products, but also include additional, overlapping, information encrypted in the combination of synonymous codons. This information does not affect the protein encoding (i.e. phenotypically \u2018silent'), and is associated with different biophysical and evolutionary aspects related, among others, to the amplification of the genomic coding potential, to the regulation of viral gene expression and to the mediation of intercellular interactions (Brierley, 1995; Cuevas et al., 2012; Firth and Brierley, 2012; Gale et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Accordingly, it is reasonable to anticipate that the genomic footprints of virus host co-evolution could be seen in the form of common compositional signatures shared both by viral and host genomes. Indeed, examination of such signatures has revealed correspondences between the genomes of viruses from different specific groups and their hosts (Barrai et al., 1990; Cardinale and Duffy, 2011; Greenbaum et al., 2008; Jenkins et al., 2001; Kerr and Boschetti, 2006; Lobo et al., 2009; Mihara et al., 2016; Pride et al., 2006; van Hemert et al., 2007). For example in Bahir et al. (2009) and Mihara et al. (2016) a significant correlation between GC content of bacteriophages with their prokaryotic hosts was demonstrated (although no significant associations were found for other taxonomic groups). In Greenbaum et al. (2008), Lobo et al. (2009) and Shackelton et al. (2006) it was shown that CpG pairs are under-represented in many RNA and most small human DNA viruses, in correspondence to dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts. Further motivated by the possibility that a complete dependence on the translational machinery of a cell might subject the codon usage of viral genes to host selection pressures, various studies have focused on exploring the similarity between the codon usage preferences in viruses and their hosts. These studies revealed numerous examples of viral codon usage either matching or significantly deviating from the codons usage for corresponding organisms from different taxonomic domains (Bahir et al., 2009; Barrai et al., 2008; Carbone, 2008; Cheng et al., 2012; Coleman et al., 2008; Gu et al., 2004; Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016; Lobo et al., 2009; Lucks et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2006; Sau et al., 2005, 2007; Su et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2008). Nevertheless, almost all of the previous works examined a limited number of specific viral families and were mostly based on comparisons of very basic (low-dimensional) compositional characteristics of genomic sequences such as: GC content, dinucleotides, codons and more generally short oligomers. Although these features may present, to some extent, evidence for possible virus-host co-adaptation, they cannot fully capture longer patterns of information. For example, transcription factors binding sites (TFBS), the binding site of micro-RNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs), spliceosome, sequences related to immune system (e.g. CRISPR), etc., can typically be longer than 10 nt and can vary among different viruses, cells and host organisms; therefore they cannot be fully described by simple features spanned by short nucleotide k-mers. Since viral genomes co-evolve with their hosts and adapt the function and expression of their genes to interact with intracellular environments, we expect such longer patterns to appear both in the viral and in the cellular coding regions and play role in controlling the viral fitness.",

Our analysis was based on the largest viral-host dataset analyzed so far that contains most of the available virus-host associations and covers 2625 unique viruses of all classes and 439 different hosts from all kingdoms of life. We have shown that the coding regions of many viruses tend to undergo evolutionary selection for inclusion of repeating substrings that are on average longer or more abundant than expected in random, and cannot be explained by the encoded viral/host proteins or by basic genomic features such as the preferences for synonymous codons/codon pairs or distribution of nucleotide pairs. Nor can they be explained by gene transfer mechanisms or by canonical mechanisms of protein recognition by the immune system alone. Our approach was inspired by universal methods for data compression without any prior knowledge of its statistical characteristics (Ulitsky et al., 2006; Ziv and Lempel, 1977) and is based on the idea that various aspects of viral fitness are encoded in the composition of synonymous codons by possibly long patterns of nucleotides that tend to appear in the coding regions of both viral and host genomes. Our results provide evidence of a complex genomic level evolutionary adaptation of viruses to their hosts and may have important implications in understanding the viral evolution and developing novel antiviral vaccines and therapeutic approaches.",

They are motivated by the assumption that evolution shapes the viral coding sequences to improve their interaction with the intra-cellular environment. Thus, if longer (than expected from compositional biases driven by neutral evolutionary forces) substrings of a coding region tend to appear also in host and/or other viral coding sequences, it may suggest that these substrings are associated with functional synonymous motives related to various aspects of viral replication and have been selected by evolutions to improve viral fitness, e.g. via adaptation to the cellular gene expression machinery or to the innate immune system. These scores can potentially capture known and unknown (or hidden) high dimensional (longer than a single codon or short k-mers) information encoded in the genomic substrings of nucleotides of an arbitrary length. They can be efficiently and systematically applied to a large scale set of viruses and their related hosts in an unsupervised manner, i.e. without a prior knowledge on the intrinsic genomic structure shaped by these associations, and with no prior knowledge on the substring length. In addition, as was previously demonstrated in (Zafrir and Tuller, 2017; Zur and Tuller, 2015), such scores are able to capture complex information that does not appear in single codon/codon-pairs distributions and in particular to be used for predicting the expression levels/protein levels of a gene from its sequence.",

Coding regions/viruses for which the sequence-specific/virus-specific AHRS scores were found to be significantly higher than in both randomizations models (P < 0.05) were designated as AHRS-significant, i.e. selected for long host-repetitive substrings. AHRS-significant coding regions were further analyzed in order to investigate whether the propensity to be selected for long host-repetitive substrings is related to the functional properties of the corresponding proteins. Also in order to check whether certain sectors of a coding sequence tend to be enriched with longer host-repetitive sequences more than others, local analysis of AHRS in 3 different equal parts of each coding sequence was performed. In addition, explicit relations between the global AHRS scores in AHRS-significant viruses and different low-dimensional genomic features (LDF) of their coding sequences, such as: Effective Number of Codons (ENC), Codon Pairs Bias (CPB), Dinucleotide Bias (DNTB), CpG and GC content and the total length of coding sequences were examined.

This pattern may be related to the fact that initiation and termination (of translation and transcription), encoded in the coding region ends, tend to be non-canonical in viruses (e.g. initiation via IRES), while the regulation at the middle of the coding region is more conserved relatively to the host (Clyde and Harris, 2006; Gale et al., 2000; Groat-Carmona et al., 2012; Jackson, 2005; Kieft, 2008; L\u00f3pez-Lastra et al., 2010; Thurner et al., 2004). In addition, this pattern may be related to the fact that often ends of the viral coding regions tend to include various functional structures which naturally decrease the efficiency of the host CRISPR immune system (Rath et al., 2015); this corresponds to a weaker selection pressure for sequence similarity to the host.",

Viral genomes include various types of motifs that are recognized by the host gene expression machinery; since the same (host) gene expression machinery processes both the viral and the host genes these motifs tend to appear both in the host and in the virus. Indeed, our analysis demonstrates that the long-subsequences found are enriched with sequence motifs (longer than singe codons) related to TFBS and RBPs.",

It is important to emphasize that in our analysis the amino acid content of the viral genes was controlled for; thus, the reported signals cannot be, trivially, attributed only to the classical mechanisms, such as viral recognition by the host (e.g. antibodies), as these mechanisms are traditionally believed to be based on interactions between proteins. However, it is plausible that they are related to alternative known and/or unknown immune mechanisms. One such relevant mechanism in bacteria is given by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) (Krieg, 2002). This mechanism is based on creating fragments from the viral genome that are transcribed to short RNA molecules (crRNAs); these short RNA molecules match a certain region in the viral genome and \u2018guide\u2019 a protein complex (CAS-crRNA complex) that cuts the viral genome in this region and inactivates the virus. Since this mechanism is based on the recognition of short genomic sub-sequences that should appear in the virus/phage but not in the host, this may trigger evolution of the nucleotide composition of the virus/phage to be similar to the host. This may result in similar patterns of codons, and longer sequences that appear in the phage and the host, explaining especially high levels of AHRS-significant viruses in the bacteria reported here.",

Second, it may be related to higher effective population size in bacteria and bacterial viruses, which is expected to contribute to higher selection efficiency (Kimura et al., 1963).

Specifically, we have analyzed separately groups of proteins with different functions, found high enrichment for structural proteins (see Fig. 2), and show that this result is not associated with the length of the virus ORFs. One explanation for that is related to the fact that these proteins tend to be more highly expressed and thus are under stronger selection for gene expression optimization, as is well known for non-viral genes; see for example (dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009). In addition, our analysis shows that up to 15\u201350% of the variance related to the shared host-virus sub-sequences can be explained by LDFs (e.g. codon bias; see the Results). Among others, this correlation may be related to the fact that viruses that undergo stronger selection for LDFs (e.g. due to larger effective population size or higher selection pressure) also tend to undergo stronger selection for shared long subsequences with the host in their coding region; for example, as explained above, both signals may contribute to improved expression levels.",

In this case a transferred gene is expected to be successfully expressed in a new host if its silent features are compatible (Medrano-Soto et al., 2004; Roller et al., 2013; Tuller, 2013, 2011; Tuller et al., 2011). Thus, although the host-homologous genes were excluded from our analysis, many of the results reported here may be generalized to the case of HGT. It is important to emphasize that a central HGT mechanism is transduction, the process in which bacterial DNA is moved from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage (Soucy et al., 2015). Thus, the reported relations between (i) the host silent patterns and (ii) the transferred gene silent patterns have much overlap: The fact that viral fitness is related to the similarity of its silent patterns to the host should directly improve its ability to transfer genes; it is also directly related to the fact that the silent aspects/codes in the transferred genes are more adapted to the new host since the virus undergoes evolution to be better adapted to the host.",

Second, experimental and computational approaches for engineering viral coding regions for improving and decreasing their fitness based on the optimization of their AVRS/AHRS should be developed. Third, it will be interesting to perform further specific study related to the functionality of some of the virus-host repetitive sequences, or to the ways the host immune system may have been adapted to these silent/signals.

The numbers (e.g. x/y) shown under each bar indicate the number of viruses (e.g. x) that show significant enrichment out the total number of viruses checked (e.g. y); thus, for each class-specific segment, the sum of its two parts (significant and not significant) represent the total portion of viruses of this class within all viruses related to the organism described by the bar, and the sum of all segments is equal to 1. Horizontal bars visualizes the total percentage of AHRS-significant viruses in each host domain.
