Here three experiments were undertaken to better de\u00aene the clinical impact of combined PRRSV-H1N1 infections in conventional and caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs. Groups of pigs were inoculated by aerosol with PRRSV followed by H1N1 at 3-, 7-or 14-day intervals. During the post-H1N1 period, mean body temperatures, respiratory signs and mean weight gains in the PRRSV-H1N1 inoculated groups were recorded and compared with those in uninoculated controls (experiments 1 and 2) or in singly virus-inoculated pigs (experiment 3). In a \u00aerst experiment with conventional pigs, the PRRSV-3d-H1N1 and PRRSV-7d-H1N1 infections induced mean body temperatures >40.5\u00b0C during 8 days (peaks 41.1 and 41.6\u00b0C, respectively) and mean growth reductions of 3.4 and 4.8 kg, respectively, during the 2 weeks after H1N1, along with marked depression and respiratory disease. The PRRSV-14d-H1N1 infection, on the contrary, was largely subclinical. In a second experiment with conventional pigs, PRRSV-3d-H1N1 and PRRSV-7d-H1N1 infections were clinically milder, with smaller increases in mean body temperatures (peak 40.5\u00b0C in both groups) and growth reductions (1.4 and 1.6 kg, respectively). In both groups, only one pig showed prominent general and respiratory signs. In a \u00aenal experiment with CDCD pigs, PRRSV-7d-H1N1 infection had minimal effects on mean clinical performances and growth and, except for one pig that was severely affected, differences with the single virus inoculations were negligible. Thus, both the time interval between infections and the sanitary status of pigs can affect the clinical outcome of dual PRRSV-H1N1 infections. However, factors so far unknown seem to cause large variations in the clinical response between individual pigs. U. S.",

Virus transmission readily occurs by the respiratory route, and multiplication in the respiratory tract is followed by viraemia and replication in several organs. The virus has a predilection for pulmonary alveolar macrophages (AMs) and the lungs are a major target organ (Duan et al., 1997; Labarque et al., 2000) .

            "text": "However, it cannot be denied that there has been a general increase in respiratory disease and poor productivity since PRRSV has become enzootic. Respiratory infections which have been very common for many years seem to have increased in severity since the appearance of PRRSV. In problem herds, PRRSV has been demonstrated together with various bacteria and with porcine respiratory coronavirus and swine in\u00afuenza virus (Keffaber et al., 1992; Morrison et al., 1992; Halbur et al., 1993; Kamogawa et al., 1996) . Combined infections with PRRSV and other agents may therefore play an important part in respiratory disease problems. It has previously shown that experimental dual infections with PRRSV followed by H1N1 in\u00afuenza virus can result in enhanced fever, respiratory disease and growth retardation in comparison with the respective single virus infections (Van Reeth et al., 1996) . In these earlier studies, conventional PRRSV-seronegative pigs were used and a \u00aexed 3-day time interval between PRRSV and in\u00afuenza virus inoculations. Yet, PRRSV replicates in the lungs during 1 month and longer (Duan et al., 1997; Labarque et al., 2000) , and there is thus a much longer time period for a second infection to occur in the PRRSV-infected pig. Under \u00aeeld conditions, secondary infections may occur with an interval of a few days or several weeks, and the exact timing and chronology of infections will differ from case to case. The present experiments compare PRRSV-H1N1 inoculations at 3-, 7-and 14-day intervals in conventional pigs. Next to clinical evaluations, this study includes bacteriologic examinations of the lungs of selected pigs. In addition, the clinical effects of the PRRSV-7 day-H1N1 inoculation were studied for the \u00aerst time in caesareanderived colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs.",

            "text": "These studies were undertaken to better de\u00aene the clinical impact of dual viral infections with PRRSV followed by swine in\u00afuenza virus. In particular, an attempt was made to investigate the effects of the time interval between infections and of the sanitary status of pigs. The design of each of the three experiments differed depending on the principal study objectives and on the numbers of pigs available. As such, a \u00aerst experiment with conventional feeder pigs aimed at comparing PRRSV-H1N1 infections at 3-, 7-and 14-day intervals. A second conventional pig experiment was designed to con\u00aerm the clinical effects of the PRRSV-3d-H1N1 and PRRSV-7d-H1N1 inoculations and, in addition, to judge on the possible contribution of bacterial or mycoplasmal infections. Uninoculated littermates served as controls in both experiments. Singly PRRSV-or H1N1-inoculated pigs were not included, because of the limited number of pigs available for this study. Furthermore, the single virus inoculations were repeatedly shown to be subclinical under the conditions used here (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1996) . A \u00aenal CDCD pig experiment was conducted to compare the clinical effects of the PRRSV-7d-H1N1 3 and the respective single virus inoculations in pigs of the highest possible health status. 288 VAN REETH et al. The present data suggest that the time interval between a PRRSV and a subsequent in\u00afuenza virus infection can affect the clinical outcome. That is, pigs of the same herd and/or litter developed disease after PRRSV-H1N1 inoculations at 3-and 7-day intervals, but not with 14-day intervals. The reasons for the limited duration of the interaction between PRRSV and in\u00afuenza virus are unknown. PRRSV replicates in the lungs during at least 4\u00b16 weeks, and microscopic lung changes have been reported to persist until 28 days after experimental infection (Halbur et al., 1995) . However, PRRSV speci\u00aec immunity starts to develop and virus titres gradually decrease from 14 days postinoculation onwards (Nelson et al., 1994; Labarque et al., 2000) . Although knowledge of the cytokine pro\u00aele during PRRSV infection remains incomplete, cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-b have been demonstrated in the lungs during the subacute stages of infection with in\u00afuenza virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Hennet et al., 1992; McInnes et al., 1998 4 ). These`late' cytokines are known to limit the (pro)in\u00afammatory actions of the early cytokines produced during the acute stage. It has therefore been postulated that a secondary infection occurring during this period will cause few pathological and clinical effects (Bielefeldt-Ohmann, 1995) . It is thus an attractive hypothesis that the mild clinical course of the PRRSV-14d-H1N1 infection relates to the production of down-regulatory cytokines. Conventional pigs, even if clinically healthy, may carry a variety of bacteria in the upper respiratory tract and colonization of the lungs may follow after (experimental) virus infection and thereby enhance disease. Streptococcus suis was isolated from the lungs of one of two PRRSV-H1N1 infected pigs in the second conventional pig experiment. The role of this streptococcal infection in the extensive lung pathology and disease seen here is uncertain. On the one hand, the fact that just a few bacterial colonies were isolated from only one of four lung lobes minimizes their clinical signi\u00aecance. On the other hand, S. suis has been associated with disease and bronchopneumonia, particularly in pigs with concomitant virus infections of the lungs. Galina et al. (1994) have demonstrated that PRRSV can predispose pigs to infection and disease caused by S. suis. Furthermore, it is remarkable that a variety of bacteria \u00b1 Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus suis and Bordetella bronchiseptica \u00b1 have also been isolated from pneumonic lung tissue of pigs during experimental infections with PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 2000) . Thus, although conventional pig experiments have the advantage of mimicking the \u00aeeld situation closely, it is assumed that bacterial infections often contribute to the clinical picture in such experiments and that PRRSV perhaps predisposes to bacterial colonization of the lungs.",

For unknown reasons, only one out of \u00aeve pigs showed severe clinical signs upon the dual virus inoculation. Although PRRSV is recognized as one of the most important aetiologic agents in multi-infectious respiratory disease of pigs, it has proved to be extremely dif\u00aecult to reproduce such disease syndrome experimentally. Dual infections with PRRSV followed by Salmonella choleraesuis, Pasteurella multocida or Haemophilus parasuis were all very mild or subclinical (Cooper et al., 1995; Carvalho et al., 1997; Solano et al., 1997) . The combination of PRRSV with either in\u00afuenza virus, M hyopneumoniae or S suis produced disease in experiments by some researchers (Galina et al., 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1996; Thacker et al., 1999) , but remained subclinical in the hands of others (Albina et al., 1995 5 ; Cooper et al., 1995; Van Alstine et al., 1996; Pol et al., 1997) . The present study supports the suggestions that differences in the time interval between infections or in the sanitary status of pigs can be in part responsible for these discrepancies. However, a large variation in clinical disease between individual pigs is a hallmark of the PRRSV-in\u00afuenza virus infection, irrespective of the time interval between infections or the sanitary status of pigs. Finally, the important question as to which factors determine the clinical outcome of a PRRSV infection remains unanswered. Further experimental studies will be carried out to \u00aend out why severe disease develops in some PRRSV-H1N1 infected pigs and not in others.",
