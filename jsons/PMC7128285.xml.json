In particular, the use of digital technologies to crowd-source and interpret volumes of public information from the Internet for signs of outbreaks\u2014so-called event-based Internet surveillance (EBIS)\u2014has received great interest because of its potential for early detection. The National Academy of Medicine suggests that new information technology, which has increased surveillance capacity even in low-resource settings, be fully exploited.1 The United Nations recommends that the World Health Organization (WHO) create an open platform to manage and analyze public data on unusual health events globally.2 Developing the capacity for event-based surveillance is also required under the 2005 International Health Regulations (2005 IHR),3 an international law that binds 196 states worldwide.",

The detection rate approximately doubled when 6 EBIS tools were combined, and overall timeliness improved.8 Another study found that none of the examined tools could individually detect all studied events before official reporting.7 Integration is likewise needed to reduce duplication from cross feeding (ie, when one tool draws data from another) and to standardize rumor verification protocol.",

Many developing countries lack the infrastructure to conduct follow-up verification and response efforts, and the WHO currently lacks the resources to assist them. Without an effective verification and response system, the media attention resulting from an early warning can cause unnecessary economic havoc as other countries impose excessive restrictions to international trade and travel, or can lead to a diversion of scarce resources from basic health and nutrition programs to infectious disease control that may not make sense for the local population. An international funding mechanism is needed to safeguard the continued existence and advancement of EBIS, to provide access to all countries, and to strengthen outbreak verification and response capacity at national and international levels.",
