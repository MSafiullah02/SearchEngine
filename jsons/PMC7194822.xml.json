However, a series of data raises the possibility that sexual intercourse could be an additional direct way of infection. This hypothesis mainly derives from the recent evidence of a likely fecal-oral transmission.1 The exact mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the gastrointestinal tract is unknown. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) seems to be used by the virus as a receptor to enter cells. ACE2 messenger RNA is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal system, and immunofluorescent data show that the ACE2 protein is abundantly present in the glandular cells of rectal epithelia.2\n,\n3 In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification and intracellular staining of viral nucleocapsid protein in rectal epithelia demonstrated that the virus infects such epithelial cells.2, 3, 4\n",

We thus hypothesize that practice of certain sexual behaviors could constitute an additional way for the contagion, both directly (eg through oral-anal contacts), or indirectly (eg with exposure of the rectal mucosa to the saliva for lubrication during anal sex).",

Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that patients can persistently test positive on rectal swabs even after negative results for nasopharyngeal testing.5 This means that the gastrointestinal tract may continue shedding the virus and that fecal-oral, or eventually sexual, transmission may be possible despite the apparent recovery. Indeed, some authors recommend that real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction be routinely performed to test for SARS-CoV-2 from feces.3\n",

These observations highlight the need for physicians, and dermatologists in particular, to strongly discourage sexual practices if infected during the pandemic COVID-19. Indeed, beyond the hypothesized possibility of a direct sexual transmission, sexual intercourse involves close contact that inevitably expose individuals to the risk of contagion. Refining the questions in epidemiologic surveys and conducting extensive studies of the mucosal sites (genitals included) of SARS-CoV-2 shedding may perhaps confirm our hypothesis, allowing for a greater understanding about SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes and effective strategies to control infection spread.",
