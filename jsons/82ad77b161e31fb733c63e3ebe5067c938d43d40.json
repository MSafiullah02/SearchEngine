It is also responsible for large outbreaks of waterborne acute hepatitis in tropical and subtropical countries as well as sporadic infections worldwide. Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease in industrialized countries, with pigs, wild boar, and deer being the major animal reservoirs of HEV [1] . HEV, genus Hepevirus, family Hepeviridae, is an unenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. Like all RNA viruses, HEV exists as a mixture of closely related variants defining a quasispecies. The approximately 7.2 kb genome of HEV has a coding region consisting of 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF2 encodes the capsid protein; ORF3 encodes a small protein implicated in virus egress [2] , whereas ORF1 encodes a nonstructural protein that contains several putative functional domains. These include at least 4 enzyme activities: methyltransferase, cystein protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [2] . Homologies with other plant and animal positive strand RNA viruses have been used to identify other domains: the Y domain, the polyproline region (PPR), and the macro domain.",

It has been shown that the quasispecies heterogeneity in the ORF2 region encoding the capsid protein during the acute phase of infection is associated with the development of a chronic HEV infection [12] . Our data support the finding that great genetic heterogeneity of the quasispecies in patients whose infection become chronic seems to favor the appearance of variants that can persist, as reported for HCV infections [13] . Although the diversity of the region preceding the PPR was higher in patients with chronic infection, nt and aa complexities were not different in the 2 groups (data not shown), suggesting that the higher heterogeneity in chronic patients was not a general effect seen across the entire region studied. This great genetic heterogeneity could also reflect an inadequate control of the viral replication, but no correlation was found between quasispecies heterogeneity and viral concentrations. PPR appears to be dispensable for in vitro HEV replication, but it is required for in vivo infection, suggesting that it is involved in infecting cells with innate immunity [4] . Although the role of the macro domain in the replication of HEV is unknown, it does not seem to be essential for the replication of coronavirus in cell culture [14] . It was recently suggested that genes that are dispensable for virus replication are involved in modulating the host immune response, like down-regulating interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) secretion [5] . The macro domain is also involved in the inflammation caused by the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the substitution of a strictly conserved amino-acid residue is responsible for reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines [6] . The great quasispecies heterogeneity in patients whose infection became chronic may include some variants that reduce inflammatory cytokine production, which could facilitate HEV persistence. This could explain the lower serum concentrations of interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist and TNF-\u03b1 found in patients whose infection became chronic [12] .",

Similar results were obtained for the macro domain (0.52 [0.43-0.75] in group I and 0.29 [0.24-0.32] in group II; P = .03; Figure 1B). The mean pair-wise within-sample genetic distance (diversity) of the PPR was higher in group I (0.0058 [0.0039-0.010]) than in group II (0.0030 [0.0025-0.0032]; P = .006). The macro domain diversity was also greater in group I (0.0050 [0.0038-0.011]) than in group II (0.0023 [0.0019-0.0025]; P = .002; Figure 2). The nt complexity and diversity of the PPR were positively correlated with those of the macro domain (r = 0.69 P = .009 and r = 0.83 P = .0005, respectively). Association Between the Ka/Ks Ratio and the Development of a Chronic Infection The ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) for the PPRs seemed to be higher in group I (0.51 [0.38-0.70]) than in group II (0.93 [0.61-1.75]), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .30). The Ka/Ks ratios for the macro domains in group I (0.54 [0.17-0.93]) and group II (0.37 [0.27-0.38]; P = .90) were similar.",
