This paper presents the CovidNet, a COVID-19 tracking project associated with a large scale epidemic dataset, which was initiated by 1Point3Acres. To the best of our knowledge, the project is the only platform providing real-time global case information of more than 4,124 sub-divisions from over 27 countries worldwide with multi-language supports. The platform also offers interactive visualization tools to analyze the full historical case curves in each region. Initially launched as a voluntary project to bridge the data transparency gap in North America in January 2020, this project by far has become one of the major independent sources worldwide and has been consumed by many other tracking platforms [4, 9]. The accuracy and freshness of the dataset is a result of the painstaking efforts from our voluntary teamwork, crowd-sourcing channels, and automated data pipelines. As of May 18, 2020, the project has been visited more than 200 million times, and has empowered over 522 institutions and organizations worldwide in policy-making and academic researches. All datasets are openly accessible for non-commercial purposes at https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com via a formal request through our APIs.",

The original purpose of the project was to provide real-time case information in North America to compensate the delayed official reporting at the time. In less than three months, the platform has grown into a Global COVID-19 tracker which includes geographic information of COVID-19 spread with sub-division level breakdown for more than 27 countries and territories. Up to now, we have become one of the very few completely independent reporting sources of COVID-19 case data integration. As the United States has become the epidemic center of the world since late March where a realtime data collection across the country was unavailable from most official channels, we have been the original data provider to the platforms like [4, 9] and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since March 2020. To provide a full picture about COVID-19, we have also collaborated with another project team [1] to integrate testing and hospitalization statistics in the U.S., and delivered a richer visualization of local pandemic status combined with our real-time case data.",

While numbers were still closely tracked by local media, the task of integrating all available sources manually by volunteers had become more and more challenging. Health official departments also started to actively release case information but yet to provide a real-time data. With limited capacity, in addition to active searching for media reports by volunteers, we offer an issue report submission form to all users, through which anyone can provide useful information back to us. The submission form categorizes information reports into 9 different classes: \"New Case\", \"Recover Case\", \"Death Case\", \"Error Report\", \"Feature Request\", \"Breaking News\", \"Further Details\", \"Testing Location\", and \"Question\". Whenever a delay of our data or an error was noticed, a user could directly report the issue to us with trustful links. The reputation we built up during the initial stage has rewarded us with a large number of visits and users, which in turn provides us informative feedback frequently. As of May 14, 2020, we have received and resolved 16240 issue reports from our users, which have been a significant part of the data source. After an issue gets reported by users, a volunteer would be assigned to manually check the provided information (via media or official sites), and compare the report with all currently recorded cases (within the same county). 6 3.1.3 Rapid Increasing Stage: Since April. The total number in the U.S. surpassed 10,000 on March 27, 2020, which significantly elevated the difficulty for data collection and validation. While local media remained to be a valuable data source, in regions with large increasing numbers, there appeared to be also a delay even in media reports. On the other hand, more local health departments started to develop official announcement schedules (generally from 1 to 3 times per day). Therefore, while still accumulating local media reported data in real-time, we attempted to adapt our collection process to include most up-to-date official health reports, which would prevent a possible delay in the data integration procedure. We now give a brief introduction about the construction of this pipeline by using U.S. health systems as an example.",

While each paradigm requires a specific quality model, the general principle is to start with the data with the finest granularity and/or with the full history. For instance, when per-case data are provided (e.g. open data projects in Columbia 16 and Philippine 17 health ministries), the pipeline would aggregate from such per-case dataset to get daily case statistics and geographical distributions. Following the same principle, when health officials release and update the entire aggregated daily history (e.g., Italy and Spain), we update the entire time series whenever edits are made officially. We dedicated our effort mostly in health reporting systems with a federated administration structure. The key challenge presented with such a system is the asynchronized natural of data from different levels. Taking the United State as an example: county health departments release case statistics following their own schedules while state officials may update at a lower frequency, typically 1-3 times a day. At any given time, aggregated county-level data may differ from state-level ones. In extreme cases, state-level reports could be delayed by days.

Uncoordinated Deployment All volunteers can deploy data updates to the front-end website. This was designed earlier to avoid delayed data presentation to the public. However, when one attempts to deploy a correctly completed number change, other members might be in the middle of updating and validating case information in a different region. For instance, on April 15, 2020, when a volunteer attempted to modify the confirmed number in Okaloosa, Texas from 102 to 103, the data entry experienced a transit state as \"102103\", which was quickly corrected by the volunteer. However, during the short transit stage, there happened to be a website deployment, which resulted in an abrupt number jump by more than 100000, and then got corrected within minutes after the subsequent deployment. 21 These type of issues are not typical \"data errors\", but due to the decentralized deployment setup, which is, however, necessary to prevent delayed website presentations.

They provide daily update by collecting data from all levels of official health departments, which has been quite trustful, and we have adopted their data as our source in China. Compared with the case in U.S., the data collection in China has been relatively easy and well-organized, as official channels have started a formal reporting schedule since the early stage and no extra media reports were required. We have seen the success and the impact brought by DXY's integrated data platform, which helped local communities in China to response effectively to the outbreak. This inspired us to start our own project for North America and eventually as a global tracker. We also studied their data presentations which helped us build our own system.

At the same time, as inter-national connections have been much stronger than any previous time, global level pandemic information sharing would be of vital importance in both learning from experiences of other countries and assessing a local public health risk level according to interactions among different countries and regions. On the other hand, when more public challenges have upgraded to the global level, we have also seen the strength of data driven approaches in tackling large scale problems.",
