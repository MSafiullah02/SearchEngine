Srr7 has a single amino acid mutation in the S protein (L1114F). 2 Primary mixed neural cell cultures were established from the forebrains of 1-to 3-day-old neonate mice as described previously with minor modifications. 3 Primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry (FACS) to identify each cell type were as follows; anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibody for astrocytes, O4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for oligodendrocytes, and MAP-2 for neuron. Binding of the Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (GS-lectin) was used for microglia/macrophages identification. To detect MHV-specific antigen in cells, mouse anti-MHV MAbs were used. 4 MAb CC1to detect MHVR and to block the infection was kindly provided by Kay V. Holmes. 5",

To see whether this is a case or not, we have examined whether CC1 prevents wt spread from initially infected cells. Neural cells were infected with wt JHMV, and 1 hour later CC1 was added in the culture. There was no substantial difference in the proportion of wt JHM antigen-positive syncytium formation, when cultured in the presence or absence of CC1. This indicates that wt virus spread from initially infected cells is not mediated with MHVR. We have also done a similar experiment using either wt or srr7 in failed to prevent the wt virus spread in a similar way observed in srr7 infection, though it reduced wt syncytium formation to a certain extent. These results clearly showed that wt virus spread from initially infected cells to a variety of cells in an MHVR-independent fashion, while srr7 infection was solely MHVR-dependent.",

Because the virus with CC1 accounted for 2.1% of the entire neural cell population, while GS-lectinmicroglia/macrophages. In contrast, 48% of GS-lectin-positive cells were MHVRpositive, indicating that half of the microglia/macrophages express MHVR and the other half does not. Virus-bound cells accounted for only 1% of all cells isolated from brain, but more than 83% of those cells were GS-lectin-positive cells. This suggests that most of the cells bound with JHMV are microglia/ macrophage.",
