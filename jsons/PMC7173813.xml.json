However, establishing the source of infection to ascertain the possible extent of spread can be difficult, because scant epidemiological data might be available. Even when possible nodes of transmission are retrospectively identified through epidemiological investigations, nucleic acid-based tests would not be diagnostically useful if these infected individuals have recovered and no longer shed the virus. Hence, serological tests are needed to identify convalescent cases and aid investigations and containment efforts.",

We used the keywords (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d, OR \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, OR \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d) AND (\u201cserology\u201d OR \u201cserologic testing\u201d). Our search did not identify any reports of the epidemiological application of serological tests in COVID-19. In one report, researchers described serological characteristics of COVID-19, and in other publications, researchers have commented on the potential importance of COVID-19 serological tests. In another study, epidemiological investigations were reported of the epidemic in Singapore, but serological methods had not been used.\nAdded value of this study\nIn our epidemiological investigation, we used RT-PCR and serological testing to diagnose cases of COVID-19 and establish links between clusters. RT-PCR testing alone is limited by its ability to detect convalescent cases of COVID-19, because RT-PCR can only detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the period of viral shedding, which is the acute phase of infection. Serological testing can be useful in detecting previous infection in people with suspected infection who have recovered, assisting in epidemiological investigation and containment efforts.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nCOVID-19 laboratory testing is focused on use of quantitative RT-PCR for diagnosis, and serological testing can be overlooked. We have highlighted the importance of serological testing for epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 cases, and we urge further development of serological testing capabilities.\n",

Contact tracing before symptom onset was done to identify the source of exposure that led to the case being infected, allowing for further active case-finding around the source. Contact tracing after symptom onset until isolation was done to identify exposed individuals for quarantine to break the transmission chain. Both these approaches were part of the containment strategy. A close contact was defined as anyone who had prolonged contact within 2 m of the case. All close contacts with active or recent symptoms were tested, whereas those who were asymptomatic and exposed while the case was symptomatic were quarantined. Activity maps were reviewed and cross-checked to establish potential exposures and identify possible epidemiological links between cases and clusters.",

The clusters were linked to two travellers (W1 and W2) from Wuhan, China, who attended a church service at Church A on Jan 19, 2020 (figure 1\n). The clusters at Church A and Church B were linked by one individual from Church A (A2), who probably transmitted the infection to the primary case of the Church B cluster (F1) at a family gathering on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing, except for A2, who was diagnosed by serological testing.",

Challenges include difficulty in obtaining information from cases and contacts, which could be inaccurate because of recall and other biases. In our investigation, information for symptom onset of W1 and W2 was based on case history alone and could not be independently corroborated.5 In such instances, determining the transmission chain would have to account for possible inconsistencies in case history and rely on triangulation with other methods.

Identifying people who were probably infected in household or school clusters could help ascertain attack rates by age, particularly among children who mostly manifest less severe disease.18 Calculating population-level attack rates is also important to estimate disease incidence and the case-fatality rate (CFR). Thus far, the CFR for COVID-19 has been based on PCR-diagnosed symptomatic cases. Serological surveys would be important to estimate CFR more accurately and would better inform calibrated responses to COVID-19. As the pandemic progresses, monitoring seroprevalence would enable countries to track transmission dynamics and population immunity levels and to inform disease control policies.
