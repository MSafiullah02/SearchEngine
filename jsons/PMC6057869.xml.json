As of April 2016, the WHO reported 1728 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, and at least 624 deaths [2]. All known reported cases have been associated with nine affected countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Twenty-seven countries in Europe, USA, Africa and Asia have also reported cases, among people who travelled from the Middle East or their contacts [2], [3]; but none have been reported from India. In 2015, the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside of the Middle East (186 infections and 36 deaths) was reported in the Republic of Korea that was traced to a single person returning from Saudi Arabia [4].",

Human to human transmission requires close contact with infected persons [1], [4]. Muslim pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah, draw millions of people (>2.0 and > 5.0 million, respectively in 2014) to Mecca annually. Hajj is performed in the 12th month of the lunar calendar and Umrah throughout the year. A high risk of acquisition of respiratory tract infections has been reported during these pilgrimages [5] which has implications of subsequent international transmission to other countries [6], [7]. Kashmir valley in the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir receives 6\u20137 thousand Hajj and 25\u201330 thousand Umrah returnees every year. We report our findings of screening the returning pilgrims with acute respiratory tract infection for MERS coV and influenza viruses.",

In-flight announcements for all airlines arriving from Mecca and landing at Srinagar airport were arranged for disembarking passengers, and advised pilgrims with current respiratory symptoms or fever to report to the medical team stationed in the arrival hall. Disembarking passengers were also questioned about the symptoms and enrolment in the study was offered to symptomatic passengers after their informed verbal consent. Data on demographics, symptoms, and history of prior influenza vaccination were recorded in a predefined case report form. Two swabs (nasopharyngeal and throat) were collected from each participant and pooled in viral transport media; and then transported to the laboratory in Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) within 3\u20134 h of collection. Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for MERS-CoV using a WHO recommended protocol (targeting region upstream of E protein gene (upE) of MERS-CoV [8]and influenza viruses. Patients with positive results for influenza viruses were contacted for assessment for therapy by the medical clinic at SKIMS or by respective physicians and treated if indicated. Descriptive statistics was used to assess various prevalence rates. Comparison of proportions was performed by SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) Version 17 software, IBM Limited, USA. Values have been expressed as percentages and a p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of SKIMS.",

Participants had been in Saudi Arabia for 21\u201342 days (median 40 days) and reported symptoms of 1\u201315 days duration (median 5 days) (Table 1\n). Cough (89.7%) and nasal discharge (86.3%) were the most commonly reported symptoms. None of the 300 participants tested positive for MERS-CoV; however, 33 (11%) participants aged 37\u201386 years tested positive for influenza viruses (A/H3N2 = 13), A/H1N1pdm09 = 9 and B/Yamagata = 11). Influenza positive cases had a significantly higher frequency of fever, rigors, and chills than influenza test-negatives (Table 1). All influenza positive cases were asked to follow-up at the study-hospital based-clinic and advised about infection control. Sixteen (48%) patients reported back to the study clinic and were prescribed oral oseltamivir. Seventeen (52%) patients who did not reach the hospital clinic were advised to seek medical help locally and the reports were conveyed to their physicians; two were prescribed oseltamivir. There is no state policy for use of influenza antivirals, however the common practice is to prescribe oseltamivir during an influenza season for suspected influenza cases who appear sick and febrile without waiting for laboratory confirmation. No hospitalizations were needed and all had uneventful recovery over a period of 2\u20135 days (median 5 d).",
