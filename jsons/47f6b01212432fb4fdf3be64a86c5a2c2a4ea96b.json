Following this event, additional resources in IPAC and public health were instituted in Canada to improve preparedness for managing highconsequence pathogens (9, 10) . The key differences in preparedness and capacities at our hospital between SARS and COVID-19 epidemics are summarized in Table 1 . 7 Additional lessons learned were applied in the management of this patient with COVID-19. First, we did not rely on a specific dedicated team, but instead built on IPAC capacities already in place among our usual staffing model that includes baseline preparedness of management of novel high-consequence pathogens. This approach differed from SARS as well as Ebola in 2014, where many hospitals developed dedicated teams to care for these patients, which required significant investments in human resources and training (11) . In the aftermath of those epidemics, this approach was difficult to sustain for hospitals resulting in loss of preparedness. Second, what allows our hospital to maintain baseline preparedness for novel high-consequence pathogens is that our standard PPE for managing these patients only includes components that are already familiar to our HCWs. This decision was made based on evidence demonstrating that additional PPE complexity is associated with risks of self-contamination during doffing (12) . This approach is also consistent with prior evidence from SARS-CoV-1 suggesting that transmission occurs by the droplet or contact route (13) . Finally, we instituted administrative controls for preventing super-spreading events around AGMP (3, 8) . While our patient did not end up requiring any AGMP, coordinated communication and planning was in place to ensure these would be performed in a controlled fashion to minimize HCW risk.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 140, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 305, "end": 308, "text": "10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 442, "end": 443, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 963, "end": 967, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1468, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1612, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1715, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1718, "text": "8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 439, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "When to discharge this patient was a decision that required us to carefully balance the risk that a stable patient who is yet early in the COVID-19 illness with potential to require medical intervention (2), against the ongoing risk of HCW exposure with each additional day of inpatient care.
