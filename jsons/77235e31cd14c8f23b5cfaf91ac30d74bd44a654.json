Protein nanoparticles are an attractive candidate for gene and molecular therapy due to their relatively easy production and manipulation. These particles combine the advantages of both viral and non-viral vectors while minimizing the disadvantages. However, their successful application depends on the availability of selective and scalable methodologies for product recovery and purification. Downstream processing of nanoparticles depends on the production process, producer system, culture media and on the structural nature of the assembled nanoparticle, i.e., mainly size, shape and architecture. In this paper, the most common processes currently used for the purification of nanoparticles, are reviewed.",

Since then, significant advances have been experienced in the field of human gene therapy, driven by the increased knowledge and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diseases, as well as by the advances in vector design and technology to produce more effective, efficient and safer delivery vectors [5] . Since 1989, more than one thousand gene therapy clinical trials have been conducted worldwide for the treatment of several diseases (www.wiley.co.uk/genether-apy/clinical). Cancer is the main target with about 67 % of the total approved clinical trials. Further targets of gene therapy clinical trials include cardiovascular pathologies (9 %), monogenic diseases (8 %) and infectious diseases (6.6 %), among others.",

Even though viral vectors are still the most popular delivery systems used in laboratory studies and clinical trials, there are several disadvantages associated with such vectors, including possible adverse immune responses and random insertion into the genome. The advantages and disadvantages of the main delivery systems used in molecular therapy are summarized in Tab. 1. Non-viral delivery systems have several advantages over viral vectors. Such systems, which include liposomes, DNA-protein and polymeric complexes, can be constructed to be less immunogenic in order to enable repeated administrations, have no the- . Relatively low titers (10 6 -10 7 pfu/mL) Table continues on the next page oretical limit to the size of the expression cassette, can be used as a drug delivery system, and some can be produced from chemically defined components [5, 10] . However, a number of obstacles, e.g., lack of specific targeting, low transfection efficiency and transient expression, have limited the application of non-viral based vectors in molecular therapy approaches [11] , Tab. 1. The ideal delivery vector is the one that combines the advantages of both viral and non-viral vectors while minimizing all of their disadvantages. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are bionanoparticles mainly composed by structural proteins of a virus, but usually lacking the correspondent genetic material. They are produced by the recombinant expression of the viral structural proteins, which self-assemble into nanostructures identical to the native viruses. As such, while being non-infectious, VLPs have a similar structure and tropism to the natural virus from which they are derived and demonstrate comparable cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking [12] . VLPs are an attractive candidate for prophylactic vaccination, genetic and molecular therapies, since they are relatively easy to produce and manipulate. However, their successful application depends on the availability of selective and scalable methods for product recovery and purification that integrate effectively with upstream production steps. This paper reviews the most common downstream processing methods suitable for the purification of VLPs.",

Similar to other biologicals for molecular therapy [68] , the purification of VLPs has specific concerns that are related to the structural nature of the assembled nanoparticles, mainly size, shape and architecture. Producer cell-line derived impurities, as well as some producing media additives such as serum, need to be removed to meet the quality approval standards of the regulatory agencies. The general rules of thumb for the establishment of purification processes of recombinant proteins may be applied in the downstream processing of VLPs. In particular, the initial operation, aimed at the removal of the most abundant impurities or contaminants, should be selected from those having higher volumetric capacity and throughput, while the final purification steps, aimed at the removal of structurally similar molecules or assemblies, should be selected from the high selective unit operations with lower volumetric capacity and throughput, Fig. 2 . Typically, the initial steps are aimed at the separation of culture media from producing cells, product concentration and conditioning, Fig. 1 . Microfiltration and diafiltration are the operations generally selected for this stage. The purification stage of the process (see Figs. 1 and 2) involves highly selective operations, traditionally ultracentrifugation and more recently chromatography, in order to remove all impurities and purify the assembled VLPs to high purity standards. The final stage of the process (polishing stage) is aimed at the polishing and further concentration of the product. At this stage, the operations must be selected to enable an additional tight control over misassembled particles and particles with similar sizes although with different final architectures.",

For instance, depending on the type of the native virus, e.g., adenovirus, retrovirus, etc., VLPs can be released to the culture media of the producing cell culture or remain soluble or compartmentalized inside the producer cell lines. While the released particles can be easily separated from the producer cells by a simple lowspeed centrifugation, the recovery of non-released particles is preceded by a cell lysis process.",

Regarding the overall properties, released nanoparticles are involved in a lipid bilayer that renders the outermost surface of the particles negatively charged. Since it is the surface that is presented, and thus targeted, in most of the purification operations, it is very difficult to distinguish such nanoparticles from impurities containing similar outer surfaces, of which cellular vesicles are the most relevant example. The lipidic bilayer of the released nanoparticles is also very labile and overall, the particles become very sensible to shear, osmotic pressure, temperature, pH and ionic strength variations. The degradation of nanoparticles may be inherent to the majority of the purification operations, resulting in the generation of impurities with similar characteristics as the product, and thus, is another critical issue to consider when designing nanoparticles purification processes.",

According to the DLVO theory, nanoparticles are maintained in solution while the total repulsive potential is higher than the total attractive potential. In this DLVO theory, the net balance of attractive and repulsive potential energies is dependent on the surface potentials, the dielectric constant and ionic strength of the medium, and the strength of the van der Waals forces. The dispersion stability is normally associated with the presence of a surface layer of adsorbed ions that can be destabilized by the addition of neutral salts, by changing the dielectric constant, by modifying the surface potential of the particles, and/or by changing the balance of charged versus hydrophobic regions. Whilst the detailed quantitative application of DLVO theory has been criticized, presenting several limitations regarding its application to protein solutions, the theory offers a simple descriptive approach to the understanding of particle-particle interactions, and their effect on dispersion stability.",

These protocols, based on ultracentrifugation and density gradient methods, were the first to be adapted for integration in protein nanoparticle purification for therapeutic use. In these processes, the separation is achieved based on the [45, 67] , are the agents most commonly used to generate the density gradients, even though other media such as colloidal silica Percoll [54] , Nycodenz [64] , and iodixanol [79] , have also been successfully used to purify viral particles. Although they are widely used, ultracentrifugation methods are time-consuming, difficult to scale up, and recoveries are very small, mainly due to particle degradation occurring upon pressure forces or osmotic shock [52] . In addition, co-purification of contaminants derived from the culture media and packing cell line, such as membrane cell vesicles released to the culture medium, may also occur [52, 56] . Moreover, the preparation of density gradients requires technical expertise, is timeconsuming, and has several practical disadvantages regarding the manipulation of the density gradient agents. In most cases, the recovery yields are very small, at about 1.6-4.4 % [21] , mostly due to the high sensitivity of protein nanoparticle assemblies to osmotic pressure. In fact, the viscous and hyperosmotic nature of the commonly used density gradient generating agents, e.g., saccharose and caesium chloride, together with the high shear forces generated in the centrifugation force field, contribute to the disruption of integrity and functionality of assembled protein nanoparticles. Even though iso-osmotic media, such as colloidal silica Percoll [54] , Nycodenz [64] , and iodoxanol [79] have been successfully used to address these disadvantages, with evidence of preservation of the integrity and functionality of the viral particle, the use of ultracentrifugation-based methods for the large-scale purification of protein nanoparticles is still limited.

As a consequence of the macroporous structure of these materials, mass transport is mainly based on convection, which overcomes pore diffusional issues encountered in classical porous beads. The large porosity of the support leads to higher nanoparticles that have access to the ligands located inside the monolith channels [69] . The Table 4 . Different resins used in interaction and size-exclusion chromatography for purification of virus-like particles and respective % recovery rates. Table continues on the next page low pressure drop that characterizes monolith operation is an additional advantage, which enables the use of high flow rates, and thus, leads to higher throughputs as compared with traditional bead matrixes. Membrane absorbers are also being developed for nanoparticulate material purification [69] . Similar to monolithic columns, adsorptive membranes reflect technological advances on liquid-chromatography based on favorable hydrodynamics. The interaction between the target molecules and the active sites on the membrane occurs in convective flow-through pores, and thus, membrane units also maintain high efficiencies at high flow rates as well as when they are used with large molecules with low diffusivities.",
