Therein, an incident case and a prevalent case mean those who newly contract the disease and those who have already got the illness, respectively. We used a stochastic model to simulate SARS nosocomial transmission, because a stochastic model can predict both an average trend and a variation of prevalence. In addition to the transmission in a hospital, we examined the situation in which the SARS spreads outside the hospital through visitors and healthcare workers who are infected in a hospital. In fact, patients who were infected with SARS at Tan Tock Seng Hospital brought the disease into Singapore General Hospital in Singapore (8) . Moreover, we estimated the size of the SARS epidemic to estimate the period in which the negative pressure rooms will be filled, when a single SS is admitted to a hospital in Chiyoda-ku, one of the 23 wards in Tokyo, Japan, with the detailed epidemiological data from Hong Kong reported by Donnelly et al. and Leung et al.

In the model, the process of transmission is simulated stochastically. The susceptible population is divided into two groups: (1) individuals that work in the hospital or are resident patients (Nq) and (2) In the nosocomial transmission model, Nq denotes all individuals affected by infection in a hospital, including inpatients, medical staff and all the people who spend a significant amount of time in the hospital. Nq is segregated into six categories according to the SEIR model (1) . Sq defines a fully susceptible population. When an individual of Sq becomes infected, he/she enters a latent category (Lq) that is composed of infected, asymptomatic individuals. During the outbreak, frequently unprotected or inadequately protected patient-to-health-care worker contacts and grouping large numbers of ill persons greatly amplifies the chance of infection in a hospital (8, 18, 20) . The patients who are not isolated transmit the infection and produce new patients. Y denotes the category of infectious and symptomatic patients who are not isolated, and Hq denotes the category of isolated patients. The categories Rq and Dq identify recovered and dead individuals, respectively. In the early phase of the epidemic, the transmission occurs within hospitals. In the late phase, we assume that hospitals have identified the SARS epidemic, isolated infected patients, and implemented infection control. During this late phase at p days after admission of the first infected person (the index case), Lq individuals pass category Y and move directly into category Hq. Therefore, this model assumes that the first hospitalized SARS patients are left unisolated until infection control starts at p days. Figure 1 shows the scheme of the model ( Fig. 1 : Inhospital infection).",

A stochastic model is useful for a small population. Our stochastic model proceeded day by day with infection events and transition among infectious stages; the number of secondary infections and the transition among infectious stages are governed by Poisson distribution and Gamma distribution, respectively. These parameters are described below. We carried out 60,000 time simulation trials to calculate the averages and quartile points. Underlined deterministic model. To explain our stochastic model clearly, we introduce the underlined deterministic model, which is formulated by a system of differential equations. Generally, a deterministic model is adaptable for a large population. The average results of many trials in the stochastic model tend toward the result in its underlined deterministic model when stochastic simulation trials increase in number. The underlined deterministic model of our hospital-derived transmission model uses the following nonlinear system of differential equations (1) .",

We also define four periods for the Out-hospital infection model: infection to onset (tLo), onset to admission (tI), admission to discharge (tHo_R) and admission to death (tHo_D). The same symbols are also used in the control model. These parameters except for tYo are treated as probability parameters according to Gamma distributions as described previously (5, 12) . The sets of means and variances for these parameters were respectively estimated to be 4.6 days and 15.9 days 2 for tLq and tLo, 23.5 days and 62.1 days 2 for tHo_R, 35.9 days and 572.9 days 2 for tHo_D.

As a result, the maximum number of newly infected cases (the day of maximum new incidence, 25th percentile of observations [the first quartile point], median, 75th percentile of observations [the third quartile point]) were 7.3 (31, 0, 4, 11) for the control and 0.4 (2, 0, 0, 1), 1.0 (4, 0, 1, 2), 2.1 (6, 1, 2, 3), 4.3 (8, 2, 4, 6), 9.1 (10, 5, 8, 12) , and 18.9 (12, 11, 17, 25) for the case of p\u03ed2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, respectively.

The result of the simulation in the In-hospital infection model (\u03ba\u03ed0.0) indicates that the beds can accommodate all the patients that arise in the case of p\u03ed2, 4 (the maximum number is 3.4 and 7.3, respectively), while they will be filled at the 8th day for p\u03ed6. This result suggests that prolonging the non-isolation period of patients (p) exponentially increases the number of new incident cases and total prevalent cases. When taking into account SARS transmission outside the hospital in the hospital-derived transmission model (\u03ba\u05460.0), the beds are filled at the 42nd day even for p\u03ed2 (\u03ba\u03ed0.16).

Therefore, we instead considered an epidemic within a city-or ward-sized population, such as Chiyoda-ku, one of the 23 wards in Tokyo. In such a small population, the stochastic model is regarded as better than the deterministic model, because it can provide both the average and range from individuals. We therefore made a stochastic model. We investigated the dynamics of the new incident number and prevalent number of cases, assuming that the SARS epidemic occurred in Chiyoda-ku.",

In addition, in the In-hospital infection model, the maximum number of prevalent cases simultaneously increased and were higher than that of the control for p\u03ed12 (Fig. 3 (B) ). The result revealed that a prolonged preisolation period (p) would cause an exponential increase of incident cases and prevalent cases without infection spreading outside the hospital.",

Nosocomial transmission may occur when visitors and outpatients visit the hospital where SARS patients are staying. They are at risk of contracting SARS during their visits to the hospital and consequently transmitting it outside the hospital. In fact, there are many reports of outpatients and visitors being infected in the hospital and serving as a new source for SARS transmission (8, 20) . Therefore, we assessed the relationship between the number of maximum incident cases or maximum prevalent cases and the rate of secondary infections (\u03ba) in which inpatients transmit SARS to visitors and outpatients. The simulation showed that transmitting SARS outside the hospital contributed to SARS infection, especially for small p (p\u05458). The p values in the In-hospital infection model (\u03ba\u03ed0) were estimated to be 10 and 12 when the number of maximum incident and prevalent cases was greater than that of the control, while p values in the hospital-derived transmission model (\u03ba\u03ed0.98) were estimated to be 6 in both situations. Thus, when SARS leaked outside the hospital, even a small value p could cause a SARS epidemic (Fig. 4 (A, B) ). These case results indicate that it is important to diagnose and isolate SARS patients as early as possible to control the epidemic and prevent further infections.",

Secondly, the simulation results using limited Gamma distributions may include some errors. As the distributions used in this model were referred from an initial SARS epidemic in 2003, the number of cases was limited. Thirdly, there were some substituted parameters in the model. We used the sum of days from infection onset to hospital admission (tI) and from admission to discharge (or death) (tHo_R, tHo_D) as the hospitalization period of inpatients (tHq_R, tHq_D) because such data were not available for the hospitalderived transmission model.
