            "text": "The mechanism responsible for the induction of apoptosis by the rapidly replicating HM175/18f strain of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) was investigated. Full length HAV RNA and viral capsid protein VP1 were detected in 18f infected cells at earlier times post-infection than in HM175/clone 1 infected cells. Analysis of total cellular RNA from HM175/18f infected FrhK4 cells by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and Northern blot hybridization revealed extensive degradation of both the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. Similar degradation was observed when these cells were infected with Human coxsackievirus B1, a fast replicating enterovirus. In contrast, the parental strain of 18f, HM175/clone 1 did not induce RNA degradation. Inhibition of RNA degradation correlated with inhibition of virus replication. The pattern of rRNA degradation resembled degradation of rRNAs by RNase L, an enzyme activated in interferon-treated cells following infection with certain viruses. Ribosomal RNA degradation was accompanied by the reduction in the levels of several cellular RNAs including those for \u03b2-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, while the levels of c-myc and c-jun were higher. Interferon mRNAs could not be detected in either infected or mock-infected control cells, and STAT1, a key regulator of interferon action was not phosphorylated following virus infection. These results reveal a heretofore-undescribed pathway that involves the regulation of RNA degradation and apoptosis following HAV/18f replication in FrhK4 cells.",

It is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route and is a principal agent of localized food-borne outbreaks of infectious hepatitis in developed countries [17] . The virus contains a single (+) stranded RNA genome that is approximately 7.4 kb long and contains a 3 poly (A) tail. The 5 end is uncapped but covalently linked to the viral coded protein VPg [65] . The viral genome has been cloned and sequenced from a number of strains.

The cp strains arise during repeated passage of cc strains in permissive cells [2, 7, 21, 25, 47, 62, 68] . Although the molecular basis for the development of the cp phenotype is poorly understood, it is well documented that both viral genome replication and viral protein expression can be detected much earlier in permissive cells infected with cp strains such as HM175/18f, HM175/24a and HM175/HB1.1, than in cells infected with the parental cc strains from which they were derived [7, 26, 29, 32, 42] . The rapid replication and viral gene expression observed for cp strains has been attributed to a more efficient initiation of translation from the IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) of cp strains due to mutations in this region [9, 28, 66] , though some have disputed this interpretation [32, 38] .",

The cytopathic effect that is observed in cells following infection with cp strains of HAV has been attributed to the induction of apoptosis [7, 29] . Apart from the demonstration of a link between rapid replication and cytopathogenicity of the cp strains of HAV, the actual molecular events leading to apoptosis following infection with cp strains are unknown. Expression of P2 region proteins 2B and 2C from either cp or cc strains in FrhK4 cells result in the accumulation of a tubularvesicular network [29, 37] . Expression of the P3 region protein 3AB has been shown to result in membrane alterations in bacterial cells with resultant changes in membrane permeability [50] . The lack of correlation between apoptosis and expression of either P2 or P3 region proteins prompted us to investigate alternative mechanisms of apoptosis induction by cp strains of HAV.",

Ribosomal RNA degradation was specific for the 18f strain and the fast replicating enterovirus coxsackievirus B1 (CBV1), while the parental cc strain of 18f did not induce rRNA cleavage. The effect of 18f or CBV1 infection on rRNA integrity was observed in the absence of interferon (IFN) induction. Ribosomal RNA degradation was detected early after virus infection and prior to induction of cpe. This degradation was blocked by inhibitors of virus replication. The pattern of rRNA degradation suggests the involvement of the dsRNA activated RNase L; the regulation of this enzyme could provide an alternative mechanism by which 18f infection induces apoptosis.",

The percentage of cells exhibiting cpe increased for the next 48 h, so that by 96 h, 70 to 80 % of the cells were rounded and detached from the surface of the culture flask. Thus, even with the 18f virus, infection is characterized by a slow and asynchronous recruitment of cells into supporting viral replication. Similar effects have been reported for other cp strains of HAV, namely HM175/24a, and HB1.1 [7, 29] . In agreement with these results, we confirmed the induction of apoptosis in 18f infected FrhK4 cells by a colorimetric TUNEL assay (data not shown).

In CBV1 infected cells, degradation of both species of rRNA was observed after CBV1 infection at 6-7 hpi, when almost all the cells in the monolayer were rounded but still attached to the surface ( Fig (Fig. 2B, lane 3) , though small amounts of degradation products may be detected at 60 days following infection (Fig. 2B,  lane 5) . The levels of viral RNA and protein in clone 1 infected cells at 35 and 60 days pi were comparable to those observed in 18f infected cells, as measured by RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting (Fig. 5 ) and EIA (data not shown). We have continuously cultured the persistently clone 1 infected cells for over five months without significant changes in cell morphology or rRNA integrity. When RNA was obtained from 18f-infected monolayers following separation of the rounded cells from cells with a normal morphology by vigorous agitation, rRNA degradation was apparent in both populations of cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7) . In lane 6, only 3 \u00b5g of RNA was applied, since the percentage of floating cells at 48 hpi was low and the yield of RNA much less compared to the cells that remained attached (Fig. 2B, lane 7) . In lane 6, no intact 28S or 18S bands were visible, indicating that almost complete degradation of the rRNA species has occurred in these cells. It should be noted that CBV1 infection proceeds much faster and synchronously in FrhK4 cells. Since we did not examine rRNAs from CBV1 infected cells between 4 and 6 hpi, it is quite possible that RNA degradation occurs in CBV infection prior to the onset of morphological changes associated with cpe.",

The gel was Northern blotted and hybridized to a labeled anti-sense RNA probe specific for 28S rRNA (nucleotides 4515 to 4400). The probe was synthesized from pTRIRNA-28S by transcription with the SP6 polymerase. The arrow indicates the position of a 28S RNA degradation product. B An identical Northern blot was hybridized to a nick translated DNA probe for HAV as described in Fig. 1 . Arrows indicate position of full-length HAV RNA (7.5 kb) and putative degradation products degradation products seen in EtBr stained gels (Figs. 1 and 2 ) that migrated to the region between the 28S and 18S species. It is likely that these latter products were derived from the 5 end of the 28S rRNA and could not be detected by a probe targeted to the 3 end. Nevertheless, it is clear that both the large and small rRNA molecules were degraded in CBV1 and 18f infected cells, and that this degradation coincided with the appearance of cpe in CBV1 infected cells but preceded the appearance of cpe in 18f-infected cells. In contrast, infection of permissive cells with mouse hepatitis virus (a coronavirus) resulted in the degradation of only the 28S species [3] . Apparently intact HAV RNA was detected in 18f-infected cells at 48 hpi and 96 hpi, and, albeit at lower levels in clone 1 infected cells at 10 dpi (Fig. 3B ). This blot was exposed longer to reveal the existence of HAV RNA in clone 1 infected cells. While overexposure of the blot showed that some degradation of viral RNA might also be taking place, the bulk of the viral RNA remains intact, possibly protected from degradation by its association with capsid proteins. On the other hand, the smaller virus specific RNA molecules could have resulted from premature termination of transcription [48] .",

Cyclohexamide (CH) is a strong inhibitor of protein synthesis in many cultured cell lines and produces a marked cpe in treated cells that is attributed to induction of apoptosis [1, 7] . In agreement with the results of Brack et al. [7] , we observed 18f-like cpe after treatment of FrhK4 cells with CH at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 \u00b5g/ml. Despite the induction of cpe/apoptosis, CH treatment failed to elicit RNA degradation in uninfected FrhK4 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 8) , and inhibited both virus replication (Fig. 4A) , and degradation of RNA in 18f infected cells (Fig. 2B, lane 9 ). The inhibition of virus replication was not unexpected since CH inhibits picornavirus genome replication by preventing translation of input genome to produce viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase [1] . Brefeldin A (BFA) has been shown to induce apoptosis in other cell lines through the activation of caspase and disruption of Golgi complex function, and to inhibit replication of HAV and some picornaviruses, as well as viral RNA synthesis [5] . Treatment of FrhK4 cells with 5 \u00b5g/ml BFA produced marked apoptosis within 24 h while suppressing 18f replication and 18f induced RNA degradation (Fig. 4 , panels A and B respectively). Thus, RNA degradation in 18f-infected cells was prevented by both CH and BFA. CH and BFA induced apoptosis in FrhK4 cells was synchronous and was complete by 24 h as evidenced by cell rounding and eventual detachment from the growth surface. However, these changes were not accompanied by RNA degradation following treatment with either CH (Fig. 2B) or Brefeldin A (data not shown). Treatment of 18f-infected cells with 2.5 mM guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), on the other hand, had a marginal effect on 18f replication at high moi, and a somewhat larger effect at low moi (Fig. 4A) . However, GuHCl treatment did not prevent RNA degradation in 18f-infected cells (Fig. 4B ). It has been reported that GuHCl, an inhibitor of poliovirus replication, is ineffective against HAV due to a mutation in the genome [18] , but GuHCl was found to be a strong inhibitor of HM175/p39 virus [15] . These experiments clearly show that in FrhK4 cells, replication of the 18f virus is required for RNA degradation, and that degradation of RNA is not a consequence of apoptosis.",

Since viral RNA replication and expression occurs much earlier post infection in 18f-infected cells compared to clone 1 infected cells, the degradation of rRNAs could result from an early dsRNA dependent activation of RNase L in 18f-infected cells. We further investigated whether the lack of RNA degradation and cpe in clone 1 infected cells observed at later times pi may correlate with diminished levels of viral RNA or protein. FrhK4 cells were infected with HM175/clone 1, and the cells were serially passaged at weekly intervals until viral antigens were detectable by EIA (data not shown). After 35 days, the level of viral antigens was comparable to that observed in 18f infected cells after an acute infection. Total cellular RNA, and proteins were isolated from the persistently infected cells. The level of viral RNA in the persistently infected cells was measured at 35 and 60 days of continuous culture by RT-PCR (Fig. 5A) . The level of viral RNA was somewhat lower in clone 1 infected cells after 35 days, but at 60 days the levels were almost the same as in 18f infected cells at 48 hpi. PCR amplification was carried out for 27 and 30 cycles to ensure that the signal strengths of the PCR products were obtained before the reactions reached saturation (27 cycles) . Western blot analysis with anti-VP1 antibody also showed lesser but easily detectable accumulation of the viral capsid protein VP1 in persistently clone 1-infected cells (Fig. 5B) . However, the cells did not show any discernable morphological change after more than 120 days of weekly subculture and produced viral antigens and RNA as determined by EIA and RT-PCR. The data indicate that, unlike 18f infection, clone 1 replication and expression does not induce rRNA degradation.",

For example, translation of HAV RNA in infected cells requires interaction of trans-acting cellular protein factors with cis-acting elements present at the 5 [13, 40] . Indeed, a competition between GAPDH and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) for stem-loop IIIa of HAV IRES has been reported by Yi et al. [67] . While PTB functions as a positive effector of HAV RNA translation, the binding of GAPDH to stem-loop IIIa of HAV IRES has been shown to destabilize RNA secondary structure and inhibit translation [55, 67] . These results prompted us to investigate the levels of GAPDH mRNA in 18f-infected cells since decreased levels of this mRNA may indicate a functional relationship between 18f replication and regulation of effector proteins such as GAPDH. As a control, we also investigated whether virus infection affects the level of another cellular housekeeping gene \u03b2-actin. Northern blot hybridizations to \u03b2-actin and GAPDH specific probes were used to assess the levels of these two cellular mRNAs (Fig. 6) . The levels of both mRNAs were reduced in a time dependent manner in CBV1 and 18f infected cells while there was little effect of clone 1 infection on these molecules. However, unlike the rRNAs, we did not find any degradation products of these RNAs. Two reasons for this could be that these mRNAs are transcriptionally repressed and/or the degradation products are too small to detect by this analysis. ",

Since the cell line used for these experiments was not treated with interferon prior to virus infection, it was important to determine whether the FrhK4 cell line is a natural producer of interferon, or if interferon is induced as a result of virus infection. To investigate if interferon mRNAs were present in FrhK4 cells prior to or following virus infection, nylon arrays, each containing 1176 human genes including those for interferons \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 were hybridized to cDNA probes synthesized using total RNA from uninfected and virus infected cells as templates. Surprisingly, we did not find significant hybridization signals Table 1 . Induced and down-regulated genes during 18f infection of FrhK4 cells. Array hybridizations were carried out in duplicate with cDNA probes prepared using two independent RNA preparations each from mock and virus infected FrhK4 cells. Independent phosphorimager scans for each duplicate sample (control or infected) were averaged using AtlasImage program to produce composite arrays for control and infected cells. The composite arrays were then compared to detect differences in signal levels using AtlasImage software.",

Ratios of higher than one represent up-regulation in the infected cells. A less than two-fold difference of signal intensity between control and infected samples are considered insignificant. ND means the pixel value for that gene was equivalent to background corresponding to the interferon genes in either uninfected or HAV infected cells (Table 1) . These results are supported by the data from Pieti\u00e4inen et al. [49] suggesting that IFN mRNAs are neither present nor induced during PV1, EV1 and CBV4 infection of HOS and HeLa cells. However, low levels of IFN RNAs, and any comparative differences between uninfected and infected cells, may not be detectable by array hybridization. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from virus infected FrhK4 cells did not show increased level of \u03b2-IFN mRNA compared to uninfected cells. However, treatment of these cells with dsRNA resulted in \u03b2-IFN mRNA induction (data not shown). We investigated the possibility that low levels of IFN may be present in control or infected FrhK4 cells by looking at the phosphorylation status of STAT1 by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 7) . Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and 2 are regulators of IFNinduced gene expression. In cells treated with IFN, both STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated by Janus kinase (JAK), which is a prerequisite for dimerization and translocation to the nucleus [58, 59] . The antibody to STAT1 readily detected the two forms of this protein in both control and virus infected cells, as well Volumes of extracts containing equal number of cpm or protein were heated in SDS sample buffer containing reducing agent prior to loading on a 4-20 % polyacrylamide gel that was run in MOPS-SDS buffer along with molecular weight markers. The gel was stained, destained and, and treated with Amplify (Amersham) prior to drying according to standard protocol and exposed to phosphorimager screen, which was scanned by a Typhoon scanner as in control and interferon treated HeLa cell extracts. Both STAT1 proteins in HeLa migrate as slightly larger molecules. Using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated STAT1, STAT1 phosphorylation was not detected in either control or 18f-infected FrhK4 cells (Fig. 7) , confirming the results obtained by array hybridization. In addition, STAT1 phosphorylation was not observed in CBV1 infected FrhK4 cells while phosphorylated STAT1 was readily detected in IFN treated HeLa cells (Fig. 7, panel A) , and FrhK4 cells (Fig. 7, panel B) . These results are in agreement with those obtained by array hybridization, indicating that IFN is not expressed and, therefore, is not mediating RNA degradation in 18f-infected cells.",

This inability to cause host shut-off is most likely due to a non-functional 2A protease, and is probably a major reason for the slow growth phenotype of HAV [34] . While it would contradict published reports, it seemed possible that 18f induced RNA degradation could result in host shut-off triggered by events peculiar to FrhK4 cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of 18f infection on overall protein synthesis by pulse labeling of cells for 2 h and analysis of the products by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). As shown in Fig. 8 , CBV1 infection resulted in a dramatic reduction of cellular protein synthesis at 7 hpi, and viral proteins could be clearly identified. In contrast, the effect of 18f infection was much less pronounced, and comparable to the effect of the parental cc (clone 1) strain. Thus no positive identification of HAV specific proteins could be made from such an analysis. It should be noted that the clone 1 infected cells used for protein labeling in this experiment have been routinely sub-cultured for more than two months, and were actively producing viral antigens as detected by a colorimetric EIA procedure (data not shown) as well as viral RNA and VP1 capsid protein (Fig. 5) .

The cp strains arise during repeated passage of cc strains in permissive cells and the genetic basis for the development of the cp phenotype is poorly understood [2, 7, 21, 25, 47, 62, 68] . There is no evidence to indicate conclusively which nucleotide changes arising in the cp genotype are responsible for both the rapid growth and the cp phenotype [23, 26, 29, 38, 42, 68] . These characteristics may be the result of different mutational events that have occurred during cc strain replication. The data presented here identify a previously unreported event that occurs during infection with a cp strain of HAV, namely the degradation of rRNAs and the reduction in the level of cellular RNAs. Similar effects on rRNA, and \u03b2-actin and GAPDH mRNAs were also observed after CBV1 infection. However, the non-cpe inducing parent strain of 18f, HM175/clone 1 had only a marginal effect on rRNA integrity during long-term persistent infection. Similar to the effects of enteroviruses, such as PV1, CBV4 and EV1, on the expression of certain cellular genes involved in apoptotic pathways, c-myc and c-jun levels were moderately increased in 18f-infected cells, while c-jun level was markedly reduced in clone 1 infected cells (Table 1) . Full length viral RNA was detectable much earlier in 18f-infected cells compared to cells acutely infected with the clone 1 virus (Figs. 1 and 3) . Significantly, viral RNA and viral capsid protein VP1 were present at comparable levels following extended culture of clone 1-infected cells in the absence of significant RNA degradation (Fig. 5) .",

            "text": "Degradation of rRNA following infection of interferon treated cells has been reported for a number of DNA and RNA viruses [58, 59] . Moreover, dsRNA, a likely intermediate of RNA virus replication or transcription, has been shown to promote rRNA degradation without interferon treatment in some cell lines [6, 12, 35, 36, 45, 52, 53, 64, 69] . The function of dsRNA as an effector of the interferon response is dependent on both the cell type and the nature of the virus [58, 59] . For example, vaccinia virus is known to evade the effects of IFN treatment, but in suspension cultures of mouse L929 cells treated with IFN, rapid degradation of rRNA was observed [30] . Activation of the 2-5A/RNase L pathway has been reported during estrogen withdrawal from chick oviducts [19] . The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 2-5A, 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase can apparently be also induced by hepatitis C virus coat protein [46] . While the role of a viral protein in the activation of 2-5A/RNase L pathway in 18f or CBV1 infected FrhK4 cells cannot be ruled out, previous reports with EMC virus and the studies involving dsRNA clearly suggests a similar mechanism of rRNA degradation reported here. It remains unclear why rRNA degradation and apoptosis are absent in clone 1 infected cells despite the presence of viral RNA and protein. Perhaps cellular inhibitors of RNase L play a role in blocking RNA degradation in clone 1 infected cells [44] . It is also possible that a mechanism, analogous to the adenovirus VAI RNA mediated inhibition of PKR activity is used by the clone 1 virus to disarm the RNase L pathway [58, 59] . Clearly, accumulation of sufficient viral RNA or proteins cannot account for either rRNA degradation or the cp phenotype, since cc strains accumulate enough viral RNA and proteins after an initial lag (Fig. 5) . It is interesting to note that while the precursor of mature VP1 protein VP1-2A is present in equal amounts in both 18f and clone 1 infected cells, VP1 itself accumulates to higher levels in 18f infected cells, suggesting a slower processing of the precursor in clone 1 infection. Surprisingly, we did not see a general inhibition of protein synthesis in FrhK4 cells infected with the cp (18f) strain of HAV despite massive RNA degradation, although an almost total shutoff of host protein synthesis was observed in CBV infected FrhK4 cells (Fig. 8) . This is in contrast to the general inhibition of protein synthesis observed upon activation of the RNase L pathway in some cell lines [11, 12, 30, 35, 36, 52, 69] . The effect of CBV infection on protein synthesis is most likely a combination of rRNA cleavage (this study) and cleavage of eIF4G, poly (A)-binding protein (PBP), and other translation factors mediated by an active 2A protease [10, 39, 41] .",

            "text": "It has been shown that both caspase activation and apoptosis induction can occur when 2 -5 A synthetase is activated and rRNA degradation is induced [11, 12, 24, 52, 69] . While we have not directly assessed the level of 2-5A following virus infection, no other RNase currently known produces the characteristic degradation pattern of rRNA that we have observed. It is apparent from our data, however, that RNA degradation is dependent upon cp virus strain replication, since compounds, such as cycloheximide and Brefeldin A, that inhibited 18f replication also abolished rRNA degradation in 18f infected cells (Figs. 2 and 5) . Treatment in the absence of infection did not induce RNA degradation. Additionally, the treatment of uninfected cells with these compounds induced apoptosis in the absence of RNA degradation (Figs. 2 and 4) . In view of the temporal relationship between onset of rRNA degradation and induction of cpe/apoptosis, these results suggest that RNA degradation following 18f (or CBV1) infection is the cause, rather than the effect, of apoptosis. On the other hand, an apoptotic reaction may also be induced by the preferential synthesis of apoptosis inducing proteins such as c-jun [20] or c-myc [22] . As shown in Table 1 , several gene transcripts linked to apoptosis are present in higher levels in 18f-infected cells compared to clone 1 infected cells. Particularly intriguing are lack of induction of c-myc and downregulation of c-jun in clone 1 infected cells. We cannot rule out the possibility, therefore, that apoptosis in 18f-infected cells may be induced via regulation of relevant proteins such as c-jun or c-myc.",

Therefore, the nature of the host cell is clearly as important as the genetic makeup of the virus. It is interesting to note that a 14 base insertion is present in the IRES of cp strains HM175/18f as well as HM175/24a. It would be tempting to speculate that conformational changes brought about by this or other mutations result in a better inducer of 2 -5 A synthetase, a possibility that is currently under investigation.",

We believe that the apparent lack of inhibition of host protein synthesis in 18f-infected cells is a result of asynchronous RNA degradation, which masks the effect of RNA degradation on protein synthesis. The other possibility is the absence of activation of dsRNA stimulated PKR, which may be lacking in these cells. However, several different mechanisms exist, through which viruses can disarm the PKR response [58, 59] . Further studies are required to assess the level of activity of this enzyme in virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "Recent studies using DNA arrays have revealed that genes involved in the interferon pathway (interferon response genes, ISGs) are the major targets of a diverse group of viruses [27] . A direct effect of interferon in inducing 2 -5 A synthetase during 18f or CBV infection is unlikely because we failed to detect IFN mRNA or STAT1 phosphorylation in either uninfected or virus infected cells. These results are supported by previous findings that cell culture adapted HAV does not induce IFN in cultured cells [63] . Moreover, recent studies also have shown that a non-cytopathic cc strain of HAV down regulates dsRNA-induced transcription of \u03b2-IFN [8] . However, there are now several studies to show that ISGs can be regulated in the absence of IFN by viral dsRNA or viral proteins [6, 45, 64] . While many viruses have evolved mechanisms to disarm various facets of the IFN inducible antiviral response, the usurpation of the IFN response by the cp strain 18f to facilitate it's spread is unique. The fact that only a few cell lines of primate kidney origin are susceptible to apoptosis in response to rapidly replicating HAV variants suggests that both cellular processes and genotypic changes in the viral genome are responsible for the establishment of a cp phenotype. In order to define the contributions of these two processes, it will be necessary to examine strain differences at the genetic level as they relate to substantive changes in viral protein expression/function, and to investigate the connection between viral and cellular events at the level of cellular protein expression.",

Sixty-five \u00b5g of each protein extract was subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-10 % polyacrylamide gels followed by electrophoretic transfer onto supported nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of VP1 and actin with specific antibodies were performed as described under Materials and methods. The positions of VP1 and actin are identified with arrows. VP1-2A is a precursor of mature VP1 and 3 ends of the viral RNA",

Proteins extracts from untreated (neg) and IFN treated (pos) HeLa cells (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., A) and from untreated (\u2212) and IFN treated (+) FrhK4 cells (B) were used as negative and positive controls for STAT1 phosphorylation, respectively. The two splice variants of STAT1 (A and B) are indicated by arrows. HeLa STAT1 proteins migrate as slightly larger molecules. Phosphorylation results in an upward shift of both splice variants in the positive control",
