Such an increase in ICU reception capacity would not have been possible by allocating patients exclusively to hub hospitals. Therefore, several hospitals also were involved to create a regional ICU network.

The respiratory high-dependency units are areas where patients can be cared for more extensively than on a normal ward but not to the point of intensive care. Respiratory high-dependency units were staffed by pulmonologists already familiar with the treatment of respiratory failure and were dedicated to hypoxemic patients requiring noninvasive respiratory assistance, such as high-flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation, including continuous positive airway pressure. The patient-to-nurse ratio was less than that of a typical ward but more than that in an ICU. The surge of respiratory high-dependency units aimed to save ICU beds for the most critically ill patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and multiple organ support therapies. Furthermore, this strong enhancement created an intermediate step between the ordinary medical ward and the ICU, allowing for a more rapid ICU discharge and patient turnover.",

In the following weeks, however, the number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeded the number of deaths or discharged patients (Fig 3\n). Nonetheless, the occupancy rate of ICUs in the region remained constant, consequent to the increase of available beds (Figs 1 and 4\n). The number of ICU beds occupied by non-COVID-19 patients decreased over time (see Fig 4), which likely can be ascribed to the suspension of ordinary surgical activity with planned postoperative ICU monitoring and to the reduction in the number of major traumas as a consequence of the restrictions imposed on everyday life activities. Therefore, the usual triage decision-making for ICU admission did not need to be modified, and all patients requiring advanced life support therapies were allocated easily.",
