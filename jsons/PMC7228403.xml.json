Since HIV infection is a common disease in Asia, the concurrence between HIV infection and other disease is an interesting problem. The present case by Zhu et al\n1\n might be the first report on coinfection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and HIV. Zhu et al\n1\n noted that \u201cHIV infection need to be regarded as vulnerable group\u201d to COVID\u201019. Nevertheless, there is no identified interrelationship between the two viral infections. In fact, despite there are many HIV\u2010infected patient and COVID\u201019 outbreak expands to cover a large area in Asia, there are few observations on infection among HIV\u2010infected patients. In our setting, Thailand, where the COVID\u201019 disease occurred after China, there is no case of infection among HIV\u2010infected patients despite there is an extremely high prevalence of HIV infection in this area. Regarding the case report by Zhu et al,\n1\n the patient did not have antiviral therapy for HIV infection before. At present, antiviral drug is widely used for treatment of HIV\u2010infected patient and anti\u2010HIV drug is proposed as possible effective drug against SARS\u2010COV\u20102.\n2\n, \n3\n Therefore, HIV\u2010infected patients receiving standard anti\u2010HIV drug might not have increased risk for COVID\u201019. On the other hand, there might be a lower risk than general population.",
