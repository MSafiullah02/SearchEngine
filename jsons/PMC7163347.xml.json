SMM refers to an organizational framework established with both vertical organizational hierarchies and horizontal relationships across departmental lines that pool team members together for specific work assignments or projects. A matrix management plan directs team members to the assignment where the need and the benefit derived are the greatest. Based on the SMM mode, the medical staffs from Union Hospital were mainly responsible for the communication with the hospital and other wards, the preparation of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) and sterilizing equipment, the writing of medical records, and the communication with patients and their families to release mental stress. The intensive medical staffs focused on the treatment and care of severe patients. Both teams gave full play to their respective advantages and carried out their duties to fight against the epidemic together.\n",
