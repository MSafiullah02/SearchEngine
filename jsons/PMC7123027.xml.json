Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is defined as SE that continues despite administration of both benzodiazepines and an appropriately dosed second-line antiseizure drug. Depending on the semiology of the seizures and comorbidities of the patient, this stage may be treated with further antiseizure drugs or anesthesia. When seizures recur upon weaning the anesthetic agent, typically after 24 h of seizure suppression, or in the rare cases where seizure control cannot be achieved with anesthesia, status epilepticus is considered to be super refractory (SRSE). The incidence of status epilepticus has been increasing, from 3.5 to 12.5/100,000 population between 1979 and 2010. During this time hospital mortality has not changed [1].\n",

These delineations have treatment implications. Convulsive seizures are easily recognized and must be controlled emergently. At the refractory stage of convulsive SE, the standard treatment is anesthesia which is highly effective at achieving seizure suppression. The semiology of nonconvulsive status epilepticus is highly varied and thus may be diagnosed after some delay when seizures are identified on the electroencephalogram (EEG) with limited or fluctuating clinical correlates. Patients may have subtle behavioral changes, confusion, or automatisms as well as an altered level of consciousness. Patients in NCSE may exhibit subtle rhythmic jerks, eye fluttering, or gaze deviation. The optimal treatment of refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus is not well established. Compared with focal status epilepticus, generalized status epilepticus may warrant more aggressive treatment. Yet, paradoxically, both focal motor seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus predict development of refractoriness [3].",

Important historical features include circumstances at seizure onset (prodromal illness, motor vehicle accident, or party suggesting substance abuse), medical history (epilepsy, neoplasms, autoimmune conditions), and active medications (cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones). The patient should be examined for signs of trauma, meningismus, and focal neurological deficits. In nearly all episodes of status epilepticus, a comprehensive laboratory evaluation including antiseizure drug levels, serum electrolytes, glucose level, urine and serum toxicology screens, troponin, lactate and creatine kinase levels, and a head computed tomography (CT) scan is warranted. Because cardiopulmonary complications are commonly associated with status epilepticus, a screening chest X-ray and electrocardiogram would aid in evaluation for aspiration, ischemic changes or development of a prolonged QTc, or other stress-related changes. When laboratory evaluation and neuroimaging do not yield an etiology for SRSE, workup continues with CSF analysis for infection and autoimmune and paraneoplastic conditions. This basic workup will identify the most common causes of SE. In addition to this evaluation, mitochondrial studies are occasionally conducted in younger patients. A stepwise approach to the evaluation of RSE etiology is presented in Table 3.\n",

The contralateral cerebellum is involved through pathways of crossed cerebellar diaschisis otherwise known as the corticopontocerebellar pathway. Laminar necrosis is theorized to occur due to cytotoxic edema from excessive excitatory amino acid release [16]. Serial imaging can reveal cerebral atrophy that results from prolonged seizures [2] and is likely the result of excitotoxic injury to the neurons. The significance of these radiographic changes is not well established. Epileptogenesis is not infrequent in patients who recover from SRSE. Sixty-nine percent of patients who recover go on to suffer medically refractory seizures [17] likely as a result of structural damage and glial scarring. SRSE affects nearly every organ system. Systemic complications include cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, venous thromboembolism, infections, and critical illness neuropathy and myopathy, among others. While these complications are common to any patient that remains in the intensive care setting for weeks to months, they appear to be more common in the setting of RSE even after adjusting for length of stay [3].",

The EEG showed multifocal lateralized periodic discharges localized independently in the left frontal, right and left frontotemporal, and occipital head regions. These findings were consistent with a widespread encephalopathic etiology. The patient exhibited a number of clinical features such as pelvic thrusting that were not directly correlated in time with the discharges. This electromechanical dissociation suggested a subcortical as opposed to cerebral origin for these clinical features. Given the continued electrographic seizures and clinical events, phenobarbital was administered, leading to a discontinuous, and in her case, burst\u2013suppression pattern (Fig. 2). Despite treatment with several anticonvulsants and phenobarbital administration, seizures continued to occur. A left temporal seizure discharge is noted in Fig. 3. Quantitative EEG trending software facilitates following efficacy of therapy. The quantitative EEG in this patient (Fig. 3) indicated that seizures were continuing to occur at a rate of 4 per hour. During the patient\u2019s treatment, sedation was decreased periodically in order to determine if seizure potential had ceased. An example of the patient\u2019s cEEG from Hospital Day 10 shows continued seizures (Fig. 4). The seizures at this point were more widespread when compared to the distribution of the discharges at admission, suggesting the development of synchrony between the multifocal regions previously generating the seizures at admission. Quantitative EEG showed seizures occurring at a rate of 16 per hour at that point in the patient\u2019s care. The cEEG on Hospital Days 35 (Fig. 5) and 58 (Fig. 6) showed continued generalized and lateralized periodic discharges. Anesthetic therapies were required to prevent seizure recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This prompted initiation of ketamine. Her EEG then returned to baseline PLEDs and her ketamine was discontinued. A ketogenic diet was initiated although she never achieved ketosis due to the many medications and their carbohydrate contents. Intravenous methylprednisolone was attempted but did not impact favorably on her EEG. A repeat MRI of the brain performed after 3 weeks of SRSE revealed diffuse cortical atrophy, bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and FLAIR signal hyperintensities in bithalamic nuclei. Muscle biopsy showed cytochrome C-negative muscle cells, suggesting mitochondrial cytopathy. A chromosomal array showed 530 kilobase duplication at 10q26.3.

The cEEG at admission showed polyphasic lateralized periodic discharges over the right posterior head region (Fig. 8). The patient showed intermittent left upper extremity jerks, which were not in synchrony with the discharges. Rhythmic right upper extremity jerks were also noted. The lateralized periodic discharges were polyphasic in morphology, suggesting some degree of asynchrony of the underlying epilepsy network generator. The cEEG also showed rhythmic activity during stimulation and cares (Fig. 9). These discharges had the characteristics of SIRPIDs (stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges) and had no clear clinical correlate. Further maturation of the lateralized periodic discharges occurred by Hospital Day 3. This was suggested by the conversion of polyphasic to bi- and triphasic morphology (Fig. 10). These periodic discharges would emerge and resolve in a periodic manner as shown on the quantitative EEG trend display (Fig. 11). These continued as did the patient\u2019s multifocal clonic activity, prompting sedation with several agents including ketamine. The periodic discharges would resolve following administration of sedative agents (Fig. 12a) and convert to a discontinuous (Fig. 12b) and sometimes a burst\u2013suppression pattern. The patient\u2019s status epilepticus did not resolve despite several interventions. Lightening of anesthetic treatment would result in reemergence of the periodic discharges.

A CT head showed a large subdural hematoma with the right frontal and temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Following successful drainage of the subdural hematoma, the patient was noted to be intermittently mute. In addition, nursing staff noted the patient to exhibit intermittent jerking of the left face, thumb, and fingers. An emergency EEG showed polyphasic periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (\u201cpoly-PLEDs\u201d) over the right posterior temporal\u2013occipital region. Poly-PLEDs are typically present in acute or subacute conditions as opposed to chronic focal cerebral lesions. Over time, the area of cerebral damage gives rise to more synchronous discharges, and poly-PLEDs may evolve to less complex biphasic or triphasic PLEDs. This EEG was also notable for the presence of iterative discharges seen in the same derivations as the poly-PLEDs. PLEDs occurring in association with iterative discharges are referred to as \u201cPLEDs plus.\u201d Clinical seizures occur at a higher prevalence in patients with PLED plus compared to those with PLEDs alone. Prolonged EEG monitoring should be considered in patients with PLEDs plus, given the risk of subclinical electrographic seizures in these cases. In addition to poly-PLEDs and PLEDs plus, frequent electrographic and clinical seizures were present in this patient, justifying a diagnosis of focal NCSE. He was conscious in between seizures and had not required ventilator support. Non-sedating therapies for status epilepticus were utilized initially including levetiracetam, phenytoin, lacosamide, and low-dose lorazepam, which were unsuccessful. An IV infusion of phenobarbital at a subanesthetic dosage of 5 mg/kg resulted in definitive suppression of seizures in this case.",

Risk factors for refractoriness include traumatic brain injury, stroke, encephalitis, brain tumors, AED noncompliance in patients with epilepsy, and drug intoxication or withdrawal. Apart from etiology, there are no reliable predictors of outcome. In addition to the established treatment, there are several alternative or adjunctive treatment options that have anecdotal success but remain poorly studied. Mortality is generally due to transition to palliative care or complications related to treatment. Prognosis can be favorable in up to 20 % of patients despite weeks or months of seizures.",
