[14, 18, 20, 21] Median times to ICU admission and onset of secondary infection among patients at 2 hospitals were 10-12 days and 17 days after first COVID-19 symptoms, respectively. [16, 17] Median time to death was 19 days, suggesting that superinfections were often terminal events. In March 2020 at 2 New York City hospitals, bacteremia was found in 6% and 12% of all COVID-19 patients and mechanically ventilated patients, respectively. [22] In the first A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 European series, one of three patients with severe COVID-19 in France was diagnosed with secondary A. baumannii and A. flavus co-infection. [23] In a report from 552 hospitals in 30 Chinese provinces, 58% of patients were treated with antibiotics [17] . Antibiotics and antifungals were administered to 80%-100% and 7.5%-15% of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Chinese ICUs, respectively. [13-16, 21, 24, 25] At several Wuhan hospitals, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, carbapenems, azithromycin, vancomycin and linezolid were most common empiric agents, but details on dosing and treatment courses were lacking. [13, 14, 21, 25, 26] Empiric antimicrobial usage was likely widespread because 25%-70% of severely ill COVID-19 patients manifested evidence of sepsis, and it was very difficult to exclude bacterial or fungal superinfections based on signs and symptoms, physical findings, radiographic abnormalities and laboratory results. [16] [17] [18] The French patient with severe COVID-19 and aspergillosis was treated with various combinations of meropenem, tigecycline, levofloxacin, aerosolized colistimethate, voriconazole and/or isavuconazole before dying. [23] In contrast to the data above, studies of COVID-19 in 788 hospitalized patients in Zhejiang province, China and 24 patients in Seattle ICUs in January-February 2020 reported that there were no superinfections. [27, 28] In a paper on 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients at a Kirkland, Washington hospital, one P. auruginosa bloodstream infection was noted. [29] Other COVID-19 cases series did not report information on superinfections. [26, 30] Washington. [20, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30] Second, severe COVID-19 is associated with immune dysregulation, which may create a milieu for bacterial or fungal proliferation. [16, 32, 33] Patients with severe COVID-19 have higher pro-inflammatory (e.g., interleukin-2, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (e.g., interleukin-4, interleukin-10) levels, fewer CD4 and CD8 cells, and less interferon-gamma expression by CD4 cells than those with more moderate disease, which likely contributes to lung pathology. [32, 33] Cytokine release syndrome, immune exhaustion and/or lung damage may pre-dispose to superinfection.",

Bacterial or fungal co-infections are unlikely to be common in patients with mild COVID-19 or in those with more serious disease upon admission to the hospital. It is reasonable to anticipate that superinfections will occur in an appreciable minority of critically ill, hospitalized patients, since risk factors for nosocomial infections such as advanced age, underlying systemic diseases, mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospital and ICU stays are prominent features of severe disease. [14, 26] Susceptibility to infections may be abetted by immune dysregulation coinciding with acute respiratory distress. The use of corticosteroids, tocilizumab (anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody) or other immunomodulatory agents for treatment of COVID-19 could have unintended consequences for secondary infections. Adherence to rigorous infection prevention practices will be crucial in limiting nosocomial infections.",

[45] A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 DISARM sets stewardship criteria for hospitals, and mandates reporting of data on antimicrobial use. For both CMS reforms and DISARM, reimbursement is still linked to perunit drug use, which creates tension between tying revenue to prescription volume and responsible stewardship. Moreover, these reforms do not address the biggest challenge in the market, which is that numbers of AMR infections requiring a new drug are currently insufficient in the US to support more than a few agents. For example, we estimated that the annual US market for new anti-CRE drugs is only ~$300 million, even with full reimbursement. [10, 45] Other models propose to de-link revenue from use, thereby attempting to compensate the societal or insurance value of antibiotics against AMR pathogens.

A counterargument is that there are already too many drugs in certain spaces, such as anti-CRE and anti-methicillin resistant S. aureus agents. Non-profits have developed tuberculosis and malaria drugs, but their ability to sustain a successful pipeline against multiple pathogens and to respond to newly emergent threats is unproven. In addition to drug discovery and development expenses, non-profits that brought a new agent to market themselves would face formidable post-approval costs for manufacturing, regulatory compliance and pharmacovigilance (at least $350 million over the first ten years).

In the interim, legislative priorities will be impacted by the course of COVID-19 and November 2020 elections.

Early indications are that Aspergillus spp. and other fungi may play prominent roles at certain centers. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be prevalent in critically ill patients, both as empiric and pathogen-directed therapy. Managing antimicrobial usage will be a stewardship challenge. A stewardship issue we have observed is that sample collection for therapeutic drug monitoring may be limited, impacting use of agents like vancomycin. As always, patients receiving antimicrobials should be observed for Clostridioides difficile infections and invasive candidiasis. Clinicians, hospitals, microbiology labs, and public health organizations must be vigilant in monitoring the potential impact of increased antimicrobial consumption on emergence of resistance in individual patients and at institutional and regional levels. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, availability of specific antimicrobials may be limited if there are disruptions in global manufacturing or supply chains, especially at possible choke points for raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients in China and India, respectively.[34] Local evolution of AMR will occur against the backdrop of larger, ongoing trends, such as the remarkable growth of PDR-A. baumannii and metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Asia, and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the United States (US).[6,35] Before COVID-19: Antimicrobial reimbursement and development.COVID-19 has emerged at a crucial time for antimicrobial development. Realizations in the early 2000's that the antibiotic pipeline was inadequate to meet the challenge of AMR prompted public and private investments to support drug development.[36,37] As a result of these \"push\" incentives, 15 antimicrobials with activity against top-priority, AMR pathogens gained US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval from 2014-2019.[38] However, most of these agents have had negligible US sales.[39] The pipeline is the most robust it in decades, with over 60 agents, including novel biologics, in development against priority bacteria and fungi.[40,41] At the same time, many pipeline agents have overlapping spectra of activity. For example, 6 antibiotics with anti-CRE activity have been approved since 2015, and there are 9 CRE-active agents in the pipeline. While incremental improvements of pipeline agents over existing antimicrobials may have significant clinical utility,[42] economic prospects for these drugs are uncertain. If companies consistently fail and/or the pipeline is not replenished, hard-won gains may be squandered, and nextgeneration drugs may not be available against future AMR threats. There is a small window of time to rectify the antimicrobial marketplace and development model.Several proposals for reforming the marketplace and bolstering sustainability of antimicrobial development have been advanced.[43,44] Details and potential strengths and limitations of various models are listed inTable 2. Reforms have already been enacted by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), as part of their 2020 Final Rule for reimbursing hospitals.[45, 46] These measures were not meant to fix the broken marketplace, but rather to ameliorate financial pressures on hospitals that stem from use of newly approved antimicrobials. Despite their shortcomings, CMS's actions were important federal recognition of a need to address present inadequacies of antimicrobial reimbursement. Like CMS reforms, most proposals target the existing for-profit, private industry model through \"pull\" incentives that assure revenue after FDA approval of a drug. Payment to US hospitals by Medicare for care of an individual is made as a bundled disbursement, based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) classification of the case. Since all services and treatments are subsumed under the DRG, use of higher cost new antimicrobials in hospitals may be disincentivized.

Within policy discussions and debates on these issues, there is unprecedented opportunity to also re-consider AMR and antimicrobial development. Prior to COVID-19, there was steadily growing appreciation of the importance of these issues by governments and policy groups. US Congress passed the first pull incentive in 2012. The GAIN (Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now) Act granted 5 years of additional market exclusivity for new antibiotics, but its impact was undermined by the unprofitability of these drugs.[43] New market exclusivity legislation, the REVAMP (Re-Valuing Anti-Microbial Products) Act, failed to pass Congress in 2018. REVAMP proposed a 12-month exclusivity extension for any brand name drug, if a company brought a novel antibiotic to approval. DISARM has circulated for 2 years in the current Congress, and it was included in the original Senate version of the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) Act that was drafted in response to COVID-19.
