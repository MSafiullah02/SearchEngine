Methods: This was a prospective, observational study conducted in the EMS system of Taipei, Taiwan. Probable/suspect cases of SARS were defined by World Health Organization criteria. SARS-related transports were categorized into 1) requests from hospitals for probable/suspect cases of SARS, 2) quarantined individuals, and 3) febrile persons. City ambulances were organized into teams A, B, and C for transports of different perceived risks. Data on the EMS volume, the transport category, the final SARS status of patients, and the EMT responsible for the transports were collected. The EMS projected volume was computed by previous years' data and compared with that collected. The SARS incidence among EMTs was assessed by investigating probable SARS (P-SARS) and by surveying the seroprevalence of SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody. Results: From March 18 to June 19, 2003, there were 7,961 EMS transports, similar to the volume projected from previous years (7,506) (95% CI = 6,688 to 8,324). Of these, 1,760 (22.1%) were SARSrelated. When SARS-related transports were excluded, there was a 12.2% decrease (95% CI = 11.4% to 12.9%) in EMS activities. Requests from hospitals, quarantined individuals, and febrile citizens accounted for 23%, 18%, and 59% of",

Two EMTs working in team C, the team with the lowest risk, developed P-SARS. One of them died soon thereafter. The incidence of P-SARS was 0.6% (95% CI = 0.2% to 2.2%), or 0.1% (95% CI = 0.03% to 0.4%) per transport. SARS-CoV serology was available in 74.1% of EMTs who were alive. In addition to the surviving P-SARS EMT, one EMT from team A, the team with the highest risk, was seropositive. Combining P-SARS and the seropositive case, three EMTs were infected (incidence 1.3%, 95% CI = 0.4% to 3.6%). No patient transported by the infected EMTs developed SARS. The hospitals serving EMS by the infected EMTs had been involved in a clustered outbreak prior to the EMTs' infections. Conclusions: During the outbreak of SARS, the overall EMS volume did not change significantly, but the non-SARS EMS activities decreased. Compared with the general population, EMS providers are at higher risk of contracting the SARS virus regardless of different perceived levels of risk. Standard protections and procedures for infection control should be strictly followed during transport and within the hospital environment.

SARS infections among other HCWs were also reported, although these reports were much less detailed. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] During the SARS outbreak, emergency medical services (EMS) systems were used to move febrile patients to medical facilities for further assessments and care, 10 and they were also responsible for the transport of the ill or quarantined people who had close contacts with SARS patients. It is possible that EMS personnel were exposed to the SARS virus. Up to this time, SARS infection among paramedics was only briefly reported without any systematic investigation. 7 The use of EMS for SARS patients' transport as well as SARS infection among EMS providers should be evaluated. Information of this kind will be helpful in our prevention strategies for future outbreaks of SARS.",

In our system, an attempt to reduce the risk of exposure among EMTs was made by designating special transport teams and categorizing SARS-related transports according to perceived levels of risks. The purpose of the original transport scheme was to try to contain the risk of exposure to SARS virus to a limited number of ambulance crews. However, because of the increased volume secondary to clustered outbreaks, and the city policy of transporting all febrile patients seeking emergency care by EMS, all the teams were ultimately exposed to P-SARS patients. Contrary to original expectations, the severely infected EMTs (i.e., P-SARS cases with respiratory distress) were all from team C, which was responsible for transporting patients with the lowest perceived risk of SARS. However, all three teams had the same access to protective equipment and received the same education and training in infection control procedures.

It implied the possible existence of subclinical or asymptomatic cases among HCWs. [24] [25] [26] The incidence of P-SARS among EMTs studied in our metropolitan EMS system was 0.6% (2/322; 95% CI = 0.2% to 2.2%), well above that of the general public in this metropolitan area (incidence: 0.01%; 95% CI = 0.01% to 0.02%). Most individuals with SARS were HCWs, i.e., physicians and nurses. [5] [6] [7] 27 The incidence of SARS infection among physicians or nurses was not studied in this report. According to the data from other locales, among the 770 HCWs who had contact with SARS patients, 18 (2.3%) were infected with the virus. The respective rates of infection reported among nursing assistants, nurses, and physicians were 6.67%, 4.78%, and 2.88%. 28 It is reasonable to assume that EMS personnel who had contact with the SARS patients only briefly during the transport period were at lower risk of contracting SARS when compared with HCWs who had more frequent contacts with SARS patients. 28 The sources of virus infections for the EMTs deserve closer examination. When all patients transported by the three SARS-infected EMTs were reviewed and followed-up, none was diagnosed as having P-SARS or S-SARS. Therefore, SARS transmission from direct patient contact during transport would be unlikely to explain the infection. None of the families or close friends of the three infected paramedics had SARS. Possible sources of infection for these EMTs included virus transmission from nonoccupational exposure to SARS cases in the community, from contacting unrecognized asymptomatic SARS cases during transport, and from touching contaminated surfaces in the hospital environment. Subclinical SARS cases in the community, if they existed, might not have had fever in their courses and might have remained unidentified during the outbreak. These patients might have infected the EMTs. Moreover, all three hospitals serving EMS patients transported by the three infected EMTs had been involved in the clustered transmission linked to the outbreak at the municipal hospital prior to the EMTs' onsets of illness.

Third, we surveyed the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV antibody during the convalescent phase to investigate the possibility of subclinical infection, which should be included in the estimation of the incidence of EMT occupational infection. Acute sera of subclinical cases were not available because these patients were probably asymptomatic and would not be seeking medical care. Without the baseline sera before the outbreak or acute sera, we could not exclude the possibility of preceding infection of the seropositive cases before the outbreak, although it might be rare at present. Fourth, not all EMTs received the serology survey. Those not taking the serology test were all from team C.

Utilization of EMS for transporting SARS-related patients in an outbreak was closely associated with hospital-associated outbreaks and the epidemic curve of the disease. Compared with the general population, EMS providers are at a higher risk of contracting SARS virus regardless of different perceived levels of risk. Standard protections and procedures for infection control should be strictly followed during both SARS-related transports and inhospital periods.",
