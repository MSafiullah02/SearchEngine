Based on the latest proposal by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), this virus can be classified into species D of the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family and is therefore now designated as Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). After a reevaluation of genetic, immunogenic, and receptor use properties, human rhinovirus 87 and EV-D68 were assigned to the same picornavirus serotype, 2,3 indicating that EV-D68 has biological features of both enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.",

Infections with EV-D68 have been rarely reported until recently, when reports of EV-D68 associated with respiratory disease increased notably worldwide.

In contrast to the prototype Fermon strain, all circulating strains have deletions in their genomes. Respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 infection ranges from mild illness that just needs outpatient service to severe illness requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. To date, there are no specific medicines and vaccines to treat or prevent EV-D68 infection.

The polyprotein is first cleaved into three parts: P1, P2, and P3 by its proteases 2A and 3C. P1 is cleaved into four viral capsid proteins VP1 to VP4, and P2 and P3 are cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins involved in protein processing and genome replication, including 2A-2C and 3A-3D 25 (\u25baFig. 1).",

Compared with the prototype Fermon strain, all circulating strains have a 23 nt deletion at position 681 to 703 in the 5\u2032-UTR. The strains of lineage 1 have an additional 11 nt deletion at position 705 to 726 in the 5\u2032-UTR, while strains of lineage 2 have an additional 3 nt deletion at position 2,806 to 2,808 in VP1 (\u25baFig. 3A, B).

A deep depression (canyon) surrounds a pentagonal icosahedral vertex and is considered to be a receptor binding site. The canyon of EV-D68 is shallower and narrower than the canyon of other EVs, which indicates that EV-D68 may not use immunoglobulin-like receptors. The largest and most widespread EV-D68 outbreak occurred in the United States in 2014. This outbreak involved more than 1,000 cases of severe respiratory disease from almost all states in the United States. 48 The outbreak in the United States initiated a new global climax of EV-D68 detection.

An epidemic of EV-D68 usually coincides with an increased incidence of influenza-like illness 42 or severe respiratory illness. 54 In contrast to EV-D68-negative patients, EV-D68-positive patients have significantly more cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. 5, 7, 42, 57 The respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 infections ranges from relatively mild illness that just needs outpatient services to severe illness requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. 7 EV-D68 has been associated with severe LRTIs in infants and young children, and frequently occurs in these patient population with complication. 38, 49 Some patients have been admitted to the pediatric intensive care units, some patients required positive airway pressure ventilation, and some patients required even mechanical ventilation. 58 Up to now, at least 20 fatal cases of EV-D68 have been reported. 7, 32, 59, 60 Physicians should be alerted to acute, unexplained severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Although EV-D68 usually causes URTIs in adults, some patients display mild symptoms. 11, 38, 49, 52 Pharyngeal congestion, headache, and myalgia were prominent symptoms in EV-D68-positive adults, but the incidence of these symptoms had no significantly difference from that of other EVs. 11 EV-D68 infections have been significantly associated with asthma. 32 For example, EV-D68 was detected in a cluster of asthma patients in 2010 in Japan. 40 Vice versa, children with asthma are also more vulnerable to EV-D68 infections. 12 In the initial reports about EV-D68 outbreak in Kansas City and Chicago in 2014, 68 and 73% of patients had a previous history of asthma or wheezing. 54",
