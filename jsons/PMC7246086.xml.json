Clinical manifestations are varied, ranging from asymptomatic to death, complicating viral spread throughout the community [2, 3]. The virus has spread all across the U.S., with Michigan harboring the third-highest number of recorded cases in the country as of this writing. In particular, the Detroit Metropolitan area, where some of this study\u2019s population base resides, has been demonstrating an alarming mortality rate. The currently accepted reference standard for testing COVID-19 is with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral nucleic acid (further reference to a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test will be denoted as RT-PCR(+)). However, given the reported limited sensitivity of this test on initial patient presentation (70%), some studies have suggested supplementation with chest computed tomography (CT) [4\u20137].",

            "text": "Chest CT also provides the additional benefit of stratifying disease severity [8, 9]. It is important to note that the typical CT findings of COVID-19 can manifest in asymptomatic patients early in disease progression or in patients with atypical symptoms that do not garner consideration of COVID-19 [4]. Although CT is more sensitive than a chest radiograph (CXR), given the time burden of CT scanner decontamination and downstream effect on image acquisition for other emergent exams, the American College of Radiology recommends use of portable CXR to mitigate the spread of communicable disease [10]. Furthermore, in Europe the utility of CXR as a triage tool for COVID-19 has been posited given the delay between specimen collection and RT-PCR result [11]. Early recognition of the disease, especially given reports of RT-PCR false negative (FN) rates up to 30% and asymptomatic COVID-19 infected individuals is paramount in reducing community spread and appropriately isolating hospitalized patients [12]. Therefore, familiarity with the imaging findings of COVID-19 allows the radiologist to make meaningful clinical suggestions and potentially limit the spread of disease.",

Specific CXR findings were described by Wong et al., with bilateral peripheral consolidations and/or GGOs as the most common manifestation [17]. This may strengthen suspicion for COVID-19 infection and ensure that appropriate precautions are taken to limit potential viral spread in patients who may not meet criteria for testing or who were RT-PCR (\u2212). Three patients who initially tested RT-PCR (\u2212) had imaging findings suggestive of COVID-19 associated pneumonitis. In these patients, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was suggested by the radiologist, and RT-PCR for COVID-19 was repeated, resulting in a repeat RT-PCR (+) in all scenarios (Fig. 6), with repeat testing performed up to 4 times in one patient. These cases elucidate the critical role a radiologist can play in supplementing the imperfect sensitivity of the RT-PCR test for COVID-19.",

During February 2020, before the pandemic significantly affected Michigan, African Americans represented 30% of the 22,214 patient visits (versus 60.9% Caucasian) to the aforementioned EDs. It has been noted that 40% of Michigan\u2019s deaths from COVID-19 at the time of this writing are African Americans however they only make up 12% of Michigan\u2019s population [20]. Detroit (78.6% African American) has the highest number of test-positive cases in the state which may potentially be related to the association of healthcare disparities in underserved areas and the resultant disease burden [21]. While the demographics of the institutes\u2019 surrounding communities vary, the exact cause and significance of the demographic distribution in this study are beyond the scope of this study and warrant further research.",

Fourth, our results may not be as generalizable to an area without a large population of African Americans.
