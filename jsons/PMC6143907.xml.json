Numerous risk factors, including age, sex, social deprivation, smoking, use of anti-hypertensives or lipid-lowering drugs and diabetes mellitus, are associated with myocardial infarction (2\u20134). In the clinic, the treatment of AMI includes blood transfusion and a previous study has reviewed the risks and benefits of thrombolytic, anti-platelet and anti-coagulant therapies for myocardial infarction (5). In recent years, early diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been widely applied for patients with recent myocardial infarction or suspected or known coronary artery disease (6).",

Among these diagnostic methods, MRI provides a higher sensitivity and accuracy in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the clinic (10,11). The clinical utility of cardiac MRI in patients with myocardial infarction has a high reproducibility and accuracy, allowing for detailed functional assessment and characterization of myocardial tissue determined by infarct size (IS), transmural extent of necrosis (TEN) and microvascular obstruction (MVO) (12). A previous study also reported that simultaneous assessment of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and FDG uptake using a hybrid PET/MRI system is feasible, which accurately predicted the regional outcome of wall motion after AMI (13). In addition, although numerous studies have reported on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction by using MRI (14,15), the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in diagnosing patients with early-stage myocardial infarction requires to be improved.",

The present study identified that the optimal dose of CFEA was 0.30 mg/kg to achieve the maximum signal intensity for MIR detection, which enhanced the diagnostic efficacy of MRI for patients with suspected myocardial infarction. A previous study also revealed that early assessment of myocardial contractility by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is inversely associated with the contractility after revascularization in patients after AMI (27). It was demonstrated that the nano-size contrast agent CFEA improves the signal intensity for the localization of the myocardial infarction area and the accuracy of MRI in the diagnosis of clinical patients with early-stage myocardial infarction.",
