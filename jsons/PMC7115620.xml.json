            "text": "Over the past several decades, the tourism industry in South Korea has increasingly become a significant segment of the national economy. Tourism expenditures accounted for 3.2% of the total final demand and value-added revenue induced from tourism-related businesses made up 3.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in South Korea in 1988 (Oh, 2005). Twenty years later, the contribution of travel and tourism to the Korean GDP is estimated to reach 6.6% in 2008 by the World Travel and Tourism Council (2008). Before 1988, the Korean government restricted outbound travel by Korean citizens to control the outflow of foreign currency while promoting rigorously inbound tourism through mega events such as the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Olympic Games. As a result, inbound tourism grew rapidly and South Korea enjoyed a surplus in its balance of payment in travel account. However, the Korean government lifted the restriction on outbound travel by Korean citizens as well as the spending limit on credit card use during overseas travel by passing the Liberalization of Travel Code in late 1988 (Mak, 1992, Singh, 1997). After the removal of the outbound travel restriction by the government, outbound travel by Korean tourists gradually increased and the trend continued markedly throughout the 1990s and the first part of 2000s. Consequently, South Korea experienced seven consecutive years of deficits in the national balance of payments in travel account from 2000 to 2006. For example, the number of inbound tourists to Korea was recorded at 6.16 million while the number of Korean outbound tourists reached 11.61 million in 2006, resulting in a staggering deficit of $8.49 billion in the balance of payments in travel account (Korean Tourism Organization, 2007).",

Particularly, Korean leisure tourism demand for Asian countries, such as Thailand, Japan, China, Singapore and the Philippines, has markedly increased since 1992, except during the Asia Financial Crisis in 1997 and the outbreak of SARS in 2003.1\nThe outbound tourism gradually affected Korean domestic tourism. Jeju Island, located to the southeast of Korea and recently designated as a World Natural Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in June 2007, has been a leisure and honeymoon destination for Koreans.2\nThe number of Korean and international tourists to Jeju Island was approximately 4.7 and 0.38 million in 2005 respectively, according to Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Tourism Association.3\nDespite Jeju's pristine island landscapes and beach resorts - in comparison to other popular destinations on the Korean peninsula - Korean tourists have been influenced to overseas vacations by many push and pull factors. The push factors include increased discretionary income, relaxed policy on outbound travel and spending, available leisure time, and strong motivations for overseas travel. The pull factors are demonstrated in aggressive marketing by overseas tourism destinations, favorable foreign exchange rates, and convenient and competitive tour packages. The Korean tourism authority is now faced with the challenges of promoting Korean destinations to domestic tourists.",

These determinants can reveal how selected major Korean macroeconomic variables affect Korean tourists' demand for Jeju and the other popular Asian destinations. As a competitive analysis, three Asian countries, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, were selected for this study because these three countries also feature beautiful islands and have been popular with Korean tourists since the 1990s. Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore were ranked the 4th, 5th and 8th outbound tourist destinations for the Koreans in 2005, respectively. Eighty-six percept of Korean visitors to Thailand, 81.4% to the Philippines and 70.2% to Singapore were reported as leisure tourists by the Korea Tourism Organization in 2005. In addition, Table 1\nillustrates that 63.5% of Korean outbound tourists visited Jeju Island as FIT, but 75.9%, 80.3%, and 83.4%, respectively, of Korean outbound tourists took package tours to the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.",

The relationship of Korean outbound tourism demand for Jeju and the three Asian destinations can be measured by correlation coefficient. Usually, correlation coefficient is given by a constant which is not time-varying. However, in reality, correlation coefficient of tourism demand between two destinations may not be a constant since it can fluctuate over time. The MGARCH model with DCC specification, proposed by Engle (2002), provides a useful way to estimate conditional (time-varying) variance\u2013covariance matrix. Thus, the dynamic structure of conditional correlations among Korean outbound tourism demand for Jeju Island and the three Asian destinations can be analyzed by estimating DCC\u2013MGARCH model. Once the time-varying correlation series are determined, the effects of major macroeconomic variables can be analyzed by the usual regression setup. It is well known that many macroeconomic variables are non-stationary (Nelson & Plosser, 1982). It is therefore very useful to apply VECM to evaluating such non-stationary behavior of time-series variables (Engle & Granger, 1987). Thus, VECM is applied to determining the effects of major economic variables to the time-varying correlation among Korean outbound tourism demand for Jeju Island and the three Asian destinations.",

Many types of the MGARCH model can be specified by constructing different Ht and F. There are many specifications for MGARCH model in the literature. In this study, Engle's (2002) Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) specification is applied since it has fewer parameters to be estimated, and at the same time, it is relatively easy to use the numerical optimization for obtaining the convergence compared to other specifications, such as the diagonal vector and positive definitive variance specifications. The DCC\u2013MGARCH model is given by(3)Ht=Dt\u0393tDt,\n(4)Dt=diag{h11,t1/2,h22,t1/2,\u2026hMM,t,1/2},\n(5)hii,t=wi+\u03b2ihii,t\u22121+\u03b3i\u025bi,t\u221212,i=1,2,\u2026,M,\n(6)\u0393t=(diag{Qt})\u22121/2Qt(diag{Qt})\u22121/2,\n(7)Qt=(1\u2212\u03b41\u2212\u03b42)Q\u00af+\u03b41ut\u22121ut\u22121\u2032+\u03b42Qt\u22121,where \u025bt and ut=(\u025b1,t/h11,t,\u025b2,t/h22,t,\u2026,\u025bi,t/hMM,t)\u2032 denote vectors of unexpected returns and standardized unexpected returns, respectively. For simplicity, hii\n,t is given by standard GARCH(1,1) process (Bollerslev, 1986). \u0393t is the time-varying correlation matrix, and Qt denotes an M\n \u00d7 \nM symmetric positive definite matrix. Q\u00af=E[utut\u2032] is an M\n \u00d7 \nM unconditional variance matrix of ut.

Given the above model, the time-varying correlation coefficient between i and j, say, \u03c1t\n,ij, for i\n \u2260 \nj, can be expressed by the element in \u0393t as(8)\u03c1t,ij=qt,ijqt,iiqt,jj,where qt\n,ij is an i\n \u2212 \njth element of Qt.",

To complement the analysis of the impulse response functions, the forecast error variance decomposition is investigated.

The results of conditional variance equations are \u03b3\u02c6i+\u03b2\u02c6i=0.998 and 0.985 for the Philippines and Jeju Island, respectively. The volatilities of these two destinations are highly persistent. However, the other destinations, Thailand, and Singapore, do not have such persistence. The GARCH effect, \u03b2\u02c6i, is not significant and almost 0 for Singapore. When the estimated \u03b4\u02c61 and \u03b4\u02c62 are close to 0, it is concluded that the conditional correlation is constant. The highly significant values of \u03b4\u02c61 and \u03b4\u02c62 imply that the conditional correlation is time-varying. However, the seasonal effects cannot be created. For countries with island destinations, summer or winter effects turn out to be quite significant.

Regardless of these categories, all conditional correlations for tourism demand among the three Asian destinations have shown increasing patterns. This implies that a positive relationship tends to increase as time progresses. However, for the conditional correlations of tourism demand between Jeju and the three Asian destinations, there have been negative conditional correlations over certain time horizons\u2014for example, in the early 1980s, around 1990, and around 2000. The negative correlation in the early 1980s could be attributed to strict overseas travel control by the Korean government. The negative correlation during this period could be recognized as the \u201csubstitute effect.\u201d It shows that the change in demand was entailed by the change in the rate of exchange rate between two goods (Varian, 2005). Most tourists sensitive to the variability of the price could change their travel plans for more affordable destinations. From the Liberalization of the Travel Code (1988) to the Asian Financial Crisis (1997), there were distinctive \u201cU\u201d-shape conditional correlations between Jeju and the three Asian countries.

The Liberalization of the Travel Code (1988) affected clearly tourists' outbound decisions since tourists had more choices of their overseas vacation destinations.

Although COR34 was also explained to be largely self-sufficient, with an average of 55%, the variance of COR14 had a strong effect, with an average of 30% variance of COR34 in the long-run. Additionally, the real exchange rate and IPI only marginally influenced COR34.",

It is found that piecewise conditional correlations among tourism demand for Jeju and the three Asian countries are not constant but time-varying. The estimated dynamic conditional correlations among Jeju and these Asian destinations have shown increasing trends from the Liberalization of the Travel Code in 1988 to the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. From 1997 to early 2000, the conditional correlations among Jeju Island and the three Asian destinations decreased. This might indicate that the three Asian destinations gradually substituted Jeju Island by the Korean outbound tourists after the Liberalization of the Travel Code in 1988. After 2000, the dynamic conditional correlations have shown increasing trends even though decreasing trends were identified during some periods.",

Competitive pricing of airline fare can promote Jeju Island to Korean mainland outbound tourists. From policy perspective, local and federal governments should consider and support the development of regional low-cost carriers (LCC) to reduce airline transportation cost by drawing experience from the popular Silk Air and Air Asia operated by Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In addition, the government can work with the aviation industry to establish a reliable flight-demand forecasting system to plan tourism demand from the Korean mainland. Operationally, tour price for Jeju is obviously higher than those offered by the other competing Asian destinations. Tourism industry in Jeju needs to emphasize the value and experience for the visit.

However, it is believed that tourism arrival/departure time-series demonstrate conditional heteroskedasticity with time-varying interdependence between tourism demand and their determinants.

Based on the empirical results of this study, the increasing outflow of Korean outbound tourism to the three Asian destinations was fueled by the favorable real exchange effect, the South Korean Tourism Authority needs to formulate new policy to stimulate domestic tourism, such as initiating a marketing campaign with competitive tour products and services. Operationally, destination managers can use the MGARCH models to determine the volatility of tourism flows by analyzing the determinants of time-varying correlations among target market demand for their destinations and then construct competitive marketing strategies to (1) attract target inbound tourists to visit their destinations and (2) develop strategic partnership to promote regional tourism development by leveraging and complementing each destination's assets and marketing resources.",
