Rapid Response #3: Have a physical examination of the newborn between the 6 th and 10 th day after birth carried out by a paediatrician or a general practitioner within the framework of an organized care system. Rapid Response #4: Propose follow-up by remote consultation or face-to-face based on the assessment of the clinical situation, but also on the woman's social and psychological context. Rapid Response #5: Ensure the physical and mental well-being of the mother, maintain psychological support for women including remotely and accompany the mother or couple in their parenting practices. Rapid Response #6: Reinforce follow-up in case of very early discharge (before 48 hours of life). Rapid Response #7: Pay particular attention to the jaundice risk monitoring circuit and followup in the maternity ward in case of confirmed jaundice.

In a letter dated 27 th March, 2020, the French Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9 (DGS) referred the matter to the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9; HAS), with a view to drawing up general recommendations designed to ensure continuity of care for pregnant women during lockdown and travel restrictions. Given the very limited data available, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f French High Council for Public Health considered pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy to be at risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 1 . Rare cases of vertical transmission of the virus have been identified (even though no placental viremia, or presence of the virus in amniotic fluid or in cord blood has been published to date) 2-5 . The extension of lockdown and the role and workload of healthcare professionals, lead to re-interviewing organizations for the follow-up of pregnant women in terms of prevention and care. These rapid responses focus on the conditions and organization of the return home of mothers and their children during the lockdown period and the management of cases of women with COVID-19 (without signs of severity) and their newborns returning home. They should be adapted according to the geographical particularities of the epidemic outbreak and access to local resources. These rapid responses are based on the knowledge available at the time of publication and are subject to change as new information becomes available.",

The day care structures (Maternal and child welfare in France is the name of the protection system for mothers and children) have an important role to play in the continuity of care and must participate in the follow-up of women and their children (doctor, home-visiting nursery nurse) by restricting their activities, while following barrier measures. The organization of postnatal monitoring should be modulated according to the geographical particularities of the epidemic outbreak and access to local resources, perinatal health networks playing a major role. In the context of COVID-19, teamwork, communication and information sharing must be strengthened between the hospital and town to increase efficiency and safety. The methods are determined jointly by the healthcare professionals involved in caring for women (midwives, obstetricians, paediatricians, general practitioners, etc.). Given the midwives' role outside the hospital in monitoring women and their children after birth, it is essential to ensure they have all the appropriate personal protective equipment they need (masks, overalls, gloves, etc.). Institutions must draw up a list of midwives outside the hospital who can provide follow-up care for women and their children after birth to reinforce the town/hospital link. The role of perinatal networks is essential in the epidemic context. All of these measures aim to step up outpatient care and facilitate the management of patients with COVID-19 by obstetrical teams in health facilities. Outpatient care is defined as medical care carried out by any health personnel (midwife, general practitioner and gynaecologistobstetrician) who work in the city.",
