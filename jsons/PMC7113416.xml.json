To protect their anonymity, the group session leader asked participants not to share their names. He asked them to share their insights and observations in response to a handful of general questions about their deployment experience (Appendix 2; available online only). The group session leader informed responders that relevant information they shared would be aggregated, summarized, de-identified, and included in a report shared regularly with internal stakeholders at the CDC to identify gaps or redundancies in the deployment process, improve processes, and fine-tune the deployment experience for future deployers. For example, in response to this input from returned deployers, presenters updated information in security briefings. Emergency response leaders tried to reduce the volume of email sent to deployed staff. The practice of having an in-country technology specialist become more standardized. After returning from the field, more deployers had access to help completing complicated travel vouchers and reimbursement paperwork. The CDC granted USB drive exceptions for computers in the field when deemed helpful. Feedback collected and shared by resilience team members also supported development of improved checklists of steps in the deployment process and helpful packing lists.",
