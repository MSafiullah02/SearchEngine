COVID-19 is primarily a disease with respiratory manifestations [1], but there are increasing reports of cardiovascular [2, 3] and thromboembolic complications [4\u20138]. These are partially attributed to systemic inflammation and coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 infection. We report the first case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection.",

The patient reported a 4-day history of a constant right-sided fronto-temporal headache, with gradual onset and increasing severity. He was a life-long non-smoker with a past medical history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He weighed 148 kg. On admission, he presented with no neurological deficits and no respiratory signs or symptoms. He had persistent severe headache and one episode of fever with a blood pressure of 170/111 mmHg, oxygen saturations of 99% on room air and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Chest radiography showed bilateral infiltrates, and so a nasopharyngeal Covid-19 swab was taken which confirmed active COVID-19 infection. Laboratory findings are reported in Table 1.",

However, he re-presented 4 days later with acute neurological symptoms with examination showing reduced power and numbness in the right upper and lower limbs, slurred speech and expressive dysphasia. He had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 10. The CT venogram was re-reviewed and a filling defect in the right sigmoid and transverse sinus involving the torcula was correctly identified (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient was treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). After 24 hours, the NIHSS score improved to 4. The patient was deemed suitable for discharge and commenced on apixaban 10 mg twice a day for 7 days with review by the local thrombosis service. At the time of writing the patient is recovering at home.",

It is an emerging disease and knowledge within the scientific and clinical community is increasing, but gaps remain in the collective understanding. While COVID-19 is primarily a disease with respiratory manifestations [1], there are increasing reports of cardiovascular and thrombotic complications which are important for clinicians to be aware of. It is known that during infection with COVID-19 there is a pro-inflammatory immune response, that the severity of inflammation corresponds with the severity of the clinical situation, and that high levels of inflammatory processes are associated with a hypercoagulable state. Coagulopathy has been observed in similar diseases [10] including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses, respectively [11]. Expert consensus suggests prophylactic treatment with LMWH should be considered during admission and for 7\u201314 days after discharge for patients with COVID-19. Clinicians need to consider the options for treatment doses during admission and beyond discharge in patients with multiple risk factors [4\u20138].",

It can present with a wide range of clinical spectra predominantly affecting younger patients, with a female to male ratio of 3:1, indicating a significant female preference [12]. There are inherited and acquired risk factors for CVTS. In this case, inherited causes were thought unlikely due to age and a lack of prior thrombotic events. Acquired causes include brain tumours, head trauma and local central nervous system infection, none of which were present in this patient. A prothrombotic state is a risk factor for CVTS and this patient was positive for COVID-19. With the emerging evidence of thrombotic complications and prothrombotic states in COVID-19, we conclude COVID-19 was the risk factor precipitating this episode of CVTS.",
