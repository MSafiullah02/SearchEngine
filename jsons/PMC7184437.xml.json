The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is quickly affecting the delivery of health care worldwide [1\u20134]. This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations [1\u20134]. Chronic kidney disease constitutes a relevant co-morbidity, and dialysis centres pose a risk as potential vector in the spreading of this pandemic [1\u20134]. In previous epidemics or catastrophic situations, the case fatality rate has always been much higher in dialysis patients than in the general population.",

At the present time, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious, but with a lower case fatality rate than the other two viruses. Compared with the previous two outbreaks, the epidemic area of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is larger, the number of infected people and, consequently, the number of deaths higher, and the strain on the healthcare system, as well as the global economic loss, greater [1\u20134].",

Dialysis patients constitute a susceptible population because of their older age and their less efficient immune system, and they are therefore more prone to develop severe infectious diseases than the general population [5, 6]. Dialysis patients are exposed and re-exposed to a higher contamination risk than the general population because their routine treatment usually requires three dialysis sessions per week. Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously.",

The authors reviewed the whole course of the outbreak emerging in the haemodialysis centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, from 14 January 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to 17 February 2020, the day of the epidemic extinction. The authors reported that 37 cases in 230 haemodialysis patients (16.1%) and 4 cases out of 33 staff members (12.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Dialysis patients with COVID-19 had less lymphopenia, lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and milder clinical disease than other patients affected by COVID-19 infection. During that epidemic, seven dialysis patients died, including six with COVID-19 and one without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and hyperkalaemia. The outcome of the four staff members was favourable [7].",

The aim of the present review of the EUDIAL Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. In doing so, we have held in high consideration the suggestions of our Asian colleagues, given their significant experience in dealing with COVID-19 [9, 10], the interim additional guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 10 March 2020 [11] and the World Health Organization recommendation for the rational use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 [12].

The only study so far reporting an outbreak of COVID-19 in a dialysis centre indicates that dialysis patients are a highly susceptible population and haemodialysis centres are a high-risk area in the outbreak of a COVID-19 epidemic [7]. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings [8]. Prevention plays a key role; the other measures are essential in the mitigation and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in haemodialysis centres.",
