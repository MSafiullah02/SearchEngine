Some data are the records related to culture and society, and others are the descriptions of phenomena of universe and life. The large scale of data is rapidly generated and stored in computer systems, which is called data explosion. Data explosion forms data nature in computer systems. To explore data nature, new theories and methods are required. In this paper, we present the concept of data nature and introduce the problems arising from data nature, and then we define a new discipline named dataology (also called data science or science of data), which is an umbrella of theories, methods and technologies for studying data nature. The research issues and framework of dataology are proposed.",

The digital universe is expected to be double in size every 18 months. In 2012, five times as much digital information will be generated versus 2008. When the data are explosively increasing, they also become more complicated and diversified. At the IBM Information on Demand 2009 conference, experts pointed out that in the world almost 15 GB (gigabytes) data are produced every day. These data come from various equipments including sensors, RFIDs, meters, GPSs, etc., and at least 80 percent of new data are unstructured, such as Web contents, Web logs, email, image, video, audio, and so on.",

In fact, data explosion is the course that data in computer systems explosively increase since human continuously stores data when using the computers. During the course of data explosion, the mass data appear multiple natural features including out of control, unknown, diversity and complexity. Therefore, data explosion forms data nature. Studying data nature is an effective approach to study real nature, for example, the researches on Bioinformatics [2] , Brain Informatics [3] and Behavior Informatics [4] indicate that we can study life and human brain by studying related scientific data. This paper proposes dataology (also called data science or science of data) which is an umbrella of theories, methods and technologies for studying data nature. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces data explosion. Section 3 describes data nature including natural features and evolution, as well as key issues in data nature. Section 4 presents dataology as a new research discipline and provides its framework and content. Finally, Section 5 gives concluding remarks.",

A tangible goal of brain informatics studies is to form a brain data area with a conceptual brain data model namely Data-Brain, which represents functional relationships among multiple human brain data sources, with respect to all major aspects and capabilities of human information processing systems (HIPS), for systematic investigation and understanding of human intelligence. In fact, Data-Brain construction is to form brain data area in computer. On one hand, developing such a Data-Brain is a core research issue of brain informatics. Systematic brain informatics research needs a Data-Brain to describe related knowledge and to annotate various human brain data sources, in order to support data sharing and data integration. Based on this way, it provides a long-term, holistic vision to uncover the principles and mechanisms of underlying HIPS. On the other hand, the brain informatics methodology supports such a Data-Brain construction.
