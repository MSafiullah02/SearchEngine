He was febrile to 101.7 F, moderately dehydrated, and tachycardic to 230 beats/min; tachycardia resolved as the patient defervesced. Electrocardiogram was normal. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed mild leucopenia (4.1/\u03bcL) with normal band count and mild anemia (8.5 g/dL).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcriptase PCR, as applicable, were performed on plasma for EV, HPeV, and herpes simplex virus 1/2, and on nasal wash for parainfluenza virus 1\u20134, influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus at the University of Washington, Division of Virology. Quantitative RT-PCR targeting the 5\u2032 noncoding region of HPeV RNA was present at 8,270,000 copies/mL; all other RT-PCR and PCR assays were negative. The type of the HPeV strain was determined by sequencing the complete VP-1 region of the virus from the original plasma sample according to Benschop and others and found to be HPeV-3.2\n",
