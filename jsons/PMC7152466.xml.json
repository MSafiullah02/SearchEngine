The live attenuated TC-83 virus, a subtype I-AB strain, was isolated from a donkey brain in Trinidad and was passaged 13 times in embryonated eggs.15 The virus was attenuated by 78 passages in fetal guinea pig heart (FGPH) cell cultures, plaque-picked in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), and passaged four additional times in FGPH cell cultures.16 The VEE TC-83 virus designation is a direct reference to the 83 passages in cell culture. VEE C-84 vaccine is formalin-inactivated and is made from the TC-83 production seed, TC-82, that has undergone one additional passage in CEFs.17 This C-84 production seed is passaged once more in CEFs to derive the C-84 vaccine, which is inactivated with 0.1% formalin and then freeze-dried. The inactivation procedure is based on that used by Salk and colleagues18 to inactivate the poliovirus. TC-83 and C-84 contain streptomycin and neomycin, each at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. Laboratory infections with epizootic VEEV strains closely related to the parent strain have essentially been eliminated since the introduction of these vaccines and improvement in personal protective equipment.",

The inactivated vaccine C-84 has a local reaction rate of approximately 5%, but essentially no systemic reactions are associated with its administration. Diabetes mellitus, abortion, and teratogenesis have been associated\u2014epidemiologically and/or in animal studies\u2014with natural wild-type VEEV infection.19, 20, 21 Before pregnancy testing prior to vaccination became available, three cases of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth were temporally related to the administration of TC-83.22 However, VEEV was not recovered from culture of tissues in either case. (Though they were reported to FDA, these cases were never published as case reports.) Since the advent of pregnancy testing, great care has been used to ensure that women are not pregnant before administration of TC-83. Out of an abundance of caution, persons with a family history of diabetes mellitus are considered ineligible for vaccination with TC-83, despite the lack of evidence for a causal association between diabetes mellitus and VEEV infection or vaccination with TC-83.",

Testing has shown reduced infectivity by both formalin inactivation (fV3526) and gamma-irradiation (gV3526). For example, both inactivated vaccine candidates showed a loss of neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation of suckling BALB/c mice, suggesting that the vaccines were completely inactivated. Both fV3526 and gV3526 elicited robust immune responses; furthermore, protection was demonstrated by both vaccine candidates against subcutaneous challenge with VEEV I-AB Trinidad donkey strain following two doses of either vaccine. Recently, researchers have been testing these vaccine candidates, using various adjuvants and routes of administration, against subcutaneous and aerosol challenge.24, 27, 28\n",

Genomic sequencing of six isolates from the Indian Ocean outbreak suggests that the strain responsible for the outbreak is related to East African isolates.49 In addition, evidence from the sequence data suggests that the CHIKV strain responsible for the Indian Ocean outbreak evolved, during the course of the outbreak, into several distinct variants. One mutation may have allowed the CHIKV to be efficiently transmitted by the most abundant mosquito species on La R\u00e9union (Aedes albopictus); this may help explain the noted robustness of the epidemic.49, 52, 54\n",

When injected into mice, this construct induced broad cellular immunity and produced antibodies, detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), that recognized native antigen.59 Another group is evaluating a formalin-inactivated Vero cell\u2013adapted vaccine candidate prepared using a strain from the India epidemic.60 Most recently, a promising virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine containing the viral envelope has elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates and in human volunteers.61, 62, 63 In addition, a single immunization with a measles virus\u2013vectored CHIK vaccine candidate induced high CHIKV antibody titers and protected mice from a lethal CHIKV challenge.64\n",

Under appropriate climatologic conditions, however, explosive epizootics among animals and epidemics in humans occur with considerable morbidity and mortality. In recent years, RVF has demonstrated its ability to spread northward to Egypt and into Yemen and Saudi Arabia on the Asian continent. The consequences of further spread into na\u00efve animal and human populations are potentially devastating.78 The spread of West Nile virus (WNV) has demonstrated that viruses once bounded by the Atlantic Ocean have the potential to overcome that barrier. Thus, the development of a vaccine or other countermeasures against the RVF virus is important for the protection of human and animal populations in Africa and the Middle East, U.S. military personnel involved in campaigns in those regions, and livestock and people in the United States and elsewhere.",

The Entebbe strain of RVF, isolated from a mosquito pool in Bwamba County, Uganda, is the source for the inactivated vaccine.79 The virus was passaged 184 times in adult mice, followed by two passages in fetal rhesus lung (FRhL) cells to form the production seed. Although the original vaccine was produced in primary African green monkey kidney cells, the current vaccine lots are produced in FRhL cells.80, 81 The vaccine is inactivated in 0.05% formalin. Following verification of viral inactivation, the residual formaldehyde is neutralized with sodium bisulfite to less than 0.01%. A study of the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated RVF vaccine in humans during a 12-year period showed that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic when the three-dose primary series and one booster are administered.82, 83 In particular, 540 (90%) of 598 volunteers given three 1.0-mL doses of TSI-GSD 200 subcutaneously on days 0, 7, and 28 responded with a PRNT80 titer of 1 : 40 or greater. Three-fourths of the initial nonresponders developed a PRNT80 titer of 1 : 40 or greater after a single booster. However, approximately 10% of recipients of the inactivated RVF vaccine require repeated boosting. In these individuals, a booster typically results in an adequate titer, which wanes over the next year to <1 : 40, prompting another booster (P.R. Pittman, unpublished data).",

In a Phase I randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation/route-seeking study, 56 healthy, nonpregnant subjects were randomly selected to receive RVF MP-12 (104.7 plaque-forming units [PFU] subcutaneously, n = 10; 103.4 PFU intramuscularly, n = 6; or 104.4 PFU intramuscularly, n = 27) or placebo (n = 13).91 Only infrequent and minor side effects were seen among placebo and MP-12 recipients. One volunteer had a titer of 1.3 log by direct plaquing in cell culture. Six vaccinees had transient low-titer viremia detected by amplification only; all six of these volunteers were from the group receiving 104.4 PFU intramuscularly. Neutralizing antibodies (measured by PRNT80 titer), as well as RVF-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG, were observed in 40 (93%) of 43 vaccine recipients. The highest peak geometric mean antibody titers were observed in the group receiving 104.4 PFU intramuscularly. Overall, 28 (82%) of 34 RVF MP-12 recipients available for testing remained seropositive (PRNT80 = 1 : 20) at 1 year following inoculation.91\n",

The vaccine was safe and immunogenic in this vaccine trial. A total of 18 (95%) of 19 subjects developed neutralizing antibodies against RVF virus, as determined by a PRNT80 titer of 1 : 20 or more. Results suggested that the vaccine resulted in, at most, only low-level viremia. No virus was detected by direct plaque assay; however, during the first 14 days after vaccination, nine MP-12 isolates were recovered from five subjects with the use of amplification by blind, double passage in Vero cells. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms or reversions were observed in the attenuating mutations of the parent virus.92\n",

Neutralizing antibodies are protective, although T-cell responses may also be useful.107 In addition to HFRS, hantaviruses are responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.106, 108 The hantavirus causing this syndrome in the southwest United States is called Sin Nombre virus (SNV). Humans become infected with hantaviruses via inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta.109 The prototype hantavirus, Hantaan, was first isolated in Korea, and the first vaccine also was developed there to protect against HFRS.108, 110, 111 This inactivated vaccine, the ROK84/105 strain, harvested from suckling mouse brains, is concentrated by protamine sulfate precipitation and centrifugation. The concentrate is then exposed to formalin inactivation and purified by ultrafiltration and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Aluminum hydroxide is added to the vaccine as an adjuvant, thimerosal as a preservative, and gelatin as a stabilizer. The final product, produced by Rhein Biotech, reportedly has less than 0.01 ng/mL of myelin basic protein. The recommended regimen for this product, Hantavax, is two doses of 5120 ELISA units (0.5 mL) given 1 month apart by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route.",

Three doses (containing 8 \u00b5g DNA/4 mg gold per dose), administered 4 weeks apart, were provided to volunteers by particle-mediated epidermal delivery. The single vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies to Hantaan virus or Puumala virus, respectively, in 30% and 44% of vaccinees. Neutralizing antibodies to one or both viruses were detected in 56% of volunteers who received the combined vaccine. In an attempt to increase seroconversion, Hooper and colleagues125 conducted a Phase I clinical trial of these two DNA vaccines delivered by intramuscular electroporation, similar to the Boudreau study. Volunteers (three groups of nine individuals each) received three doses, 28 days apart, of either the Hantaan DNA vaccine, the Puumala DNA vaccine, or a mixture of both vaccines. Each dose of vaccine contained 2 mg DNA in a total volume of 1 mL saline; the combined vaccine contained 1 mg of each DNA vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies were found in 56% and 78% of volunteers who received the Hantaan or Puumala DNA vaccines, respectively. Results of the combined vaccine showed that 78% of vaccinees developed neutralizing antibodies against Puumala virus. The three volunteers with the highest antibody levels against Puumala also developed neutralizing antibodies against Hantaan. No serious adverse events resulting from the vaccines were noted in either study.",

Following another passage in the guinea pig, the virus underwent 44 newborn mouse brain passages, then was cloned and passaged 19 times in certified FRhL cells.136, 141, 142 Candid #1 proved effective in preventing disease in guinea pigs and rhesus macaques after lethal Junin virus challenge.140, 143, 144 In Phase I and Phase II clinical testing in humans, Candid #1 was safe and immunogenic.145, 146 More than 90% of volunteers developed antibodies against Junin virus, although at lower levels than those seen after mild natural infection,147 and 99% developed a Junin virus\u2013specific cellular immune response. In a pivotal efficacy study, 3255 volunteers were randomized to receive the vaccine and 3245 were randomized to receive a placebo. During the trial, 23 volunteers developed an illness that met the clinical case definition for AHF.148, 149 Of these, 22 had received a placebo and 1 had received the vaccine; vaccine efficacy by intent-to-treat analysis was 95% (95% confidence interval, 82%\u201399%; P < .001). Argentina's National Institute of Human Viral Diseases produced its own Junin vaccine, also called Candid #1, against AHF and tested it in 946 human volunteers to compare its safety and immunogenicity with that of the Candid #1 vaccine produced in the United States and used in previous studies.150 The vaccine was comparable to the U.S.-produced vaccine in terms of safety and efficacy. No severe adverse events were related to the vaccine. As a result of this study, Argentina's national regulatory authority (ANMAT) licensed the locally produced Candid #1 vaccine.151, 152\n",

For example, evidence showed that only Phase I Q fever organisms, analogous to smooth forms of bacteria, were protective, and that a transition to Phase II (rough) would occur if the organism was passaged too many times in chick embryo. Therefore, Q fever vaccines are based on Phase I organisms only.168 In addition, researchers recognized that purification to remove chicken protein and lipid and isolation of whole inactivated Coxiella by extraction, filtration, or centrifugation would result in a cleaner, less reactogenic, and highly immunogenic product. Two whole-cell vaccines came into use in high-risk subjects: an Australian vaccine made and licensed by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories166, 169 and a vaccine (IND 610) made and tested by the U.S. Army.170 Both are administered as a single 30-\u00b5g subcutaneous injection. The Australian vaccine, Q-Vax, is purified using high concentrations of NaCl to remove nonprotective antigens. The U.S. Army vaccine, Whole-Cell, Inactivated, Q-Fever Vaccine NDBR 105, IND 610, is also extracted with NaCl, then subjected to ethanol\u2013Freon 113 extraction; finally, it is purified further on a CaHPO4 2H2O (brushite) column. Despite these purification processes, however, skin testing of prospective recipients remains necessary to prevent serious reactions in persons who have experienced prior infection.",

Mice vaccinated with a single intranasal dose of the emrA1 mutant of F. tularensis LVS were protected against a lethal respiratory LVS challenge; this vaccine also provided partial protection against lethal challenge with the virulent F. tularensis SchuS4 strain.219\n",

The neurotoxin binds to the presynaptic membrane and prevents acetylcholine release, resulting in a symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis with classical bulbar palsies characterized by diplopia, dysphonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia.275 As paralysis progresses, generalized weakness occurs; if untreated, death occurs from airway obstruction and diaphragmatic muscle paralysis.

The Hc subunits of toxin types A and B were immunogenic in a clinical trial and are proceeding in development.279, 280, 281, 282 Other peptides of the toxin, including the light chain and the N terminal of the heavy chain, are also being tested283 (Fig. 12.1\n).

Early clinical data suggest a relationship between an immune response to toxins A and B with protection against a primary or recurrent case of CDI.297, 302, 303, 304, 305 After colonization, a systemic anamnestic response to toxin A, as evidenced by increased serum IgG antitoxin A levels, is associated with asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile. Serum IgG antitoxin A levels have also been significantly correlated with IgG levels against toxin B antigens, which were also higher in asymptomatic carriers.303 In patients with CDI, higher IgG antibodies to toxin A are associated with protection against recurrence.303 In an initial Phase I study, the candidate vaccine induced IgG antibodies to toxins A and B with resolution of recurrent diarrhea.304 In a more recent Phase II study, the Sanofi candidate, given in a high dose, elicited functional antibody responses in adult and elderly volunteers for at least 180 days without safety issues.306\n",
