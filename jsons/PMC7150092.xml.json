In looking at these events from a system perspective, we should be aware that the point at which a system fails is often a weakness due to failure in other parts of the system. A system is defined as \u201ca dynamic order of parts and processes standing in mutual interaction with each other\u201d (von Bertallanfy, 1968). Therefore it is necessary for all professionals reading this text to examine all of the parts and processes, especially the interactions among the parts.",

The practice of medicine is an example of the need to combine science, experience, and instinct in the development of a plan of action. Rarely do patients themselves progress in clinical presentation and disease etiology as the pages in a textbook might suggest. In 1973, Sacks wrote thatWe need, in addition to conventional medicine, a medicine of a far profounder sort, based on the profoundest understanding of the organism and of the life. Empirical science is the key to one form of knowledge, the generalized knowledge that gives us power over nature; the key to wisdom however, is the knowledge of particulars.\n",

Shortly after the cases emerged, Soviet officials explained that the source of the outbreak was related to the ingestion of contaminated meat. According to their report, contaminated animals and meat from an anthrax epizootic south of Sverdlovsk caused 96 cases of human anthrax (Meselson, 1988). Of these cases, 17 were cutaneous anthrax and 79 were gastrointestinal anthrax. Of the 96 cases, 64 of the gastrointestinal anthrax cases were fatal. At the time, there was great debate among officials from other nations as they tried to determine if the outbreak may have actually been due to covert Soviet bioweapons production.",

Four days later, seven or eight persons from the military installation were admitted to hospital number 20 in the suburbs where the military installation is located. Their symptoms were high fever (104\u00b0), blue ears and lips, choking, and difficulty breathing. They died within 6\u20137 h, and autopsies revealed severe pulmonary edema plus symptoms of a serious toxemia. About 6 days after the illness first appeared, the source and other doctors from various hospitals were called together by the district epidemiologist. The number of fatalities had risen sharply, and the source estimated deaths by this time at 40. The epidemiologist announced the outbreak of an anthrax epidemic and gave a lecture on the disease. He claimed the epidemic was caused by an illegally slaughtered cow suffering from anthrax in a town about 10 km northeast of Sverdlovsk. He said the beef had been sold in the suburb where the fatalities were occurring. This explanation was not accepted by the doctors in attendance because the fatalities were caused by pulmonary anthrax as opposed to gastric or skin anthrax, which would be more likely if anthrax-contaminated beef were eaten or handled.\n",

Furthermore, livestock downwind from the point of release died of anthrax along the same zone\u2019s extended axis. The zone paralleled the northerly wind that prevailed shortly before the outbreak (Meselson et al., 1994). Other scientists harbored doubts about the official US accusation, noting that an accidental release of anthrax spores could have been in connection with a defensive biological warfare research program, which was allowed under the 1972 convention. It was later concluded that the escape of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen at the military facility caused the outbreak.",

In the 1980s during the Reagan administration, Sverdlovsk would become one of the major points in the US indictment of the Soviet Union to build the case that the Soviets were violating the ban on the use of biological weapons imposed by the 1972 Biological Warfare Convention, which both the United States and the Soviet Union had signed. Despite the proof that Western scientists had, the Soviets (see Fig. 7.1\n) refused to discuss the incident and maintained their position that they did not have a program in bioweapons development and production.

Yeltsin had a personal connection to the Sverdlovsk issue because he had been Communist Party chief in the region at the time of the anthrax outbreak, and he believed the KGB and military had lied to him about the true explanation. At a summit meeting with President George H. W. Bush in February 1992, Yeltsin told Bush that he agreed with US accusations regarding Soviet violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and that the Sverdlovsk incident was the result of an accident at a Soviet biological warfare installation, and he promised to clean up this problem. In a May 27 interview Yeltsin publicly revealed what he had told Bush in private:We have now circumscribed the time of common exposure to anthrax. The number of red dots we can plot on our spot map places nearly all of the victims within a narrow plume that stretches southeast from Compound 19 to the neighborhood past the ceramics factory\u2026. we have clarified the relation of the timing of animal and human deaths and believe the exposure for both was nearly simultaneous.

Public health authorities were alerted, word began to spread through the medical community, and the one hospital was designated for new suspected plague admissions. Shops began closing in the most heavily affected region of the city, medical practitioners began to leave the city, and local pharmacies sold out of available tetracycline. Hospital admissions continued to grow and public health authorities were barely able to locate sufficient antibiotics to treat the ill and their care providers. Within 3 weeks the case-fatality rate had dropped from 80% to below 10%. Until adequate government supplies of tetracycline begin to arrive, approximately 30% of Surat\u2019s population fled, businesses closed, and public facilities (schools, swimming pools) shut down.

Before getting on the plane in Liberia, Mr. Duncan assisted an ill pregnant woman by helping her out of a taxi and into a hospital. It is believed the woman was an EVD patient, but he was not aware of this. Regardless of what he knew, Mr. Duncan arrived in Houston feeling well with no fever or other symptoms. Six days later Mr. Duncan felt very ill, which prompted him to seek medical attention at a hospital in Houston, Texas. His travel history was not discussed at that time, so he was discharged from the emergency room (ER) with some antibiotics for what was believed to be a routine illness. He went back to the apartment, and a few days later his condition was so severe that he reported to the ER at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas where it became apparent that he was a suspect EVD patient. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and ended up in an isolation ward. His condition worsened and he later died. Unfortunately, infection prevention standards at the hospital were not entirely adequate. This resulted in two nurses (Nina Pham and Amber Vinson) being infected with Ebola virus. They were both treated successfully and fully recovered 2 weeks later.",

Meanwhile, state and local officials in Texas had an incident on their hands. Emergency management and public health agencies had to work together to ensure that the apartment where Duncan had been staying did not become the cause of more infections. All of Mr. Duncan\u2019s contacts had to be identified, placed under strict quarantine, and monitored. After their quarantine period the apartment became a hot zone that required thorough decontamination by a commercial hazmat clean-up group, Cleaning Guys, LLC (refer to Fig. 7.9\n). None of Mr. Duncan\u2019s contacts outside of the hospital became infected and the apartment he resided in and all its contents were rendered safe using technical decontamination procedures.Critical ThinkingWhat has the 2014\u201315 EVD outbreak taught us about a few cases of viral hemorrhagic fever getting into the United States or any other developed country?

For example, how does a government begin to strengthen its core public health capacities as demanded by the international health regulations? What counts as a global health security concern? In the context of the governance of global health, including WHO reform, it will be important to distil lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet invited a group of respected global health practitioners to reflect on these lessons, to explore the idea of global health security, and to offer suggestions for next steps. Their contributions describe some of the major threats to individual and collective human health as well as the values and recommendations that should be considered to counteract such threats in the future. Many different perspectives are proposed. Their common goal is a more sustainable and resilient society for human health and well-being (Heymann et al., 2015). What will make for an interesting postoutbreak study are the geopolitical implications of a large-scale outbreak of a Category A agent, such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

This emphasizes the importance of early detection and standard procedures for containment.

It was hard to believe that we were under attack and no one really knew for some time how widespread it was or when it would end.
