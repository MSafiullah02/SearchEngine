            "text": "such as tracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), bronchoscopy, open suctioning, noninvasive ventilation and tracheostomy care pose a risk of nosocomial transmission, and it is vital that all healthcare workers involved in these procedures wear proper personal protection equipment (PPE).Training on appropriate PPE and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) use, correct donning and doffing procedures, as well as institutional infection control measures for 2 resuscitation are regularly undertaken. Donning and doffing of PPE are supervised to prevent lapses in infection control practices. A dedicated resuscitation trolley for COVID-19 patients is used to prevent contamination of equipment and nosocomial spread. A prepared airway bag containing a paediatric videolaryngoscope with disposable blades, a disposable bag valve mask (BVM), high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, in-line suction catheters and an end-tidal carbon dioxide detector is kept within easy reach. All COVID-19 wards have donning and doffing trolleys that are kept in separate areas. Our PPE/PAPR donning trolley contains four PAPR sets and PPE (N95 respirators or equivalent, goggles, shoe covers, gloves and fluid-resistant gowns). The doffing trolley is located next to a biohazard bin to prevent contamination of equipment once used (Figure 1). When an emergency code is activated, the resuscitation trolley is brought inside the patient's room and the PPE/PAPR donning trolley is kept outside. Role delegation is performed prior to entry as PPE and PAPR make communication difficult. 7 The number of healthcare workers entering the room to assist in resuscitation is kept to a minimum and opening of the patient's room door is minimised. A runner in full PPE waits outside the room to coordinate with the resuscitation team inside and obtain additional equipment as required. Communication with the runner in the ante-room should be done via a two-way communication device or a whiteboard. The airway is managed by the most experienced team member. BVM ventilation is minimised; if required, small tidal volumes are given with a good mask seal. A HEPA filter is placed between the mask and the manual resuscitator. Micro-cuffed tracheal tubes and in-line tracheal suctioning are used to minimise disconnections and aerosolization. Wearing PAPR impairs chest auscultation, thus capnography and visual confirmation of chest expansion become important to assess tracheal tube placement. After resuscitation, all disposable equipment must be safely discarded. All surfaces and reusable equipment are disinfected based on institutional guidelines. In situ resuscitation simulations is organised to familiarise all healthcare 3 workers with the resuscitation workflow, infection control measures and clinical management. It also allows healthcare workers to identify and overcome the limitations of resuscitating in smaller teams whilst wearing full PPE and PAPR. 8 A critically ill paediatric patient may require transfer to a different location within the hospital. Preparation for such a transfer should be done as for any critically ill child with consideration of the current clinical needs. There are some additional precautions that should be undertaken for a paediatric patient with COVID-19, with the main focus on infection control as well as the safety of the patient, transferring team and general public. Prior to transfer, the nurse in-charge informs the security department about the transfer who then clears the route in advance. The most direct route with least human traffic is used. The number of healthcare workers accompanying the child is kept to a minimum and only one parent wearing a surgical face mask is allowed. We avoid transferring infected children on high-flow oxygen therapy due to the risk of aerosolization. A closed-circuit transport ventilator with a HEPA filter attached is used instead of BVM to transfer an intubated child to reduce the risk of aerosolization. The patient should be adequately sedated and paralysed to prevent coughing or dislodgement of the tracheal tube en route. The receiving team should be aware of the patient's arrival and have donned full PPE prior to handover.",
