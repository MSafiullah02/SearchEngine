Fig. 1 Glucocorticoid use associates with mortality and blunts IFN beta-induced CD73 upregulation in lung vasculature and IFN beta-1a dependent signaling pathways in pulmonary endothelial cells. a (i) Independent factors associated with Day28 mortality in all IFN beta-1a-treated patients (n = 144) by logistic regression adjusted for propensity score and ARDS severity (odds ratios, OR with 95% confidence intervals, CI). (ii) Association of glucocorticoid treatment with D28 mortality in only propensity-matched IFN beta-1a-treated patients (n = 98) by logistic regression (OR with 95% CI) b Immunohistochemical staining of CD73 (brown) in lung tissue incubated in the presence of IFN beta with or without hydrocortisone (HC) for 1 and 4 days (D). D0 indicates baseline expression of CD73 in fresh lung tissue. c Quantification of CD73 positive vessels/mm 2 . The samples were incubated in the presence of two different IFN beta-1a formulations (FP-1201, circles n = 10 (day 1) and n = 11 (day 4); DS, triangles n = 8). Each data point marks an individual. The dotted line represents the placebo-induced level of CD73 expression. Statistical significance was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. d Immunofluorescence staining of IRF9 in primary human pulmonary endothelial cells after IFN beta treatment with or without HC showing marked inhibition of nuclear translocation of IRF9 by HC, the representative results of three independent experiments with the similar results. e Immunoblotting of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of pulmonary endothelial cells after IFN beta-1a \u00b1 HC demonstrating both decreased IRF9 signal and its nuclear translocation. Specific IRF9 band is indicated by an arrow, a representative blot of five independent analyses with the comparable results. GAPDH and H3 (histone) are loading controls for the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. f qPCR results of two independent experiments demonstrating the decrease in IFN beta-1a-triggered mRNA synthesis of IRF9 and STAT1 by HC.
