The final date of follow-up was February 7, 2020. Throat-swab specimens were collected and sent to the Henan center for disease control and prevention and SARS-CoV-2 detected by real-time RT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on admission and at the time of RT-PCR conversion. Data were collected from electronic medical records, with epidemiological and symptom data confirmed by directly communicating with patients or their family members (interviews conducted by L.W. and L.L.L.). The date of symptom onset referred to the day when the symptom was noted. Time to real-time RT-PCR conversion was calculated from the date of symptom onset to the day when SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable from two consecutive throat-swab specimens. Patients could be discharged from hospital when they had RT-PCR conversion and no fever for at least three days according to the interim guidance from Chinese National Heath Commission on clinical management of COVID-19 [6] . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, with a waiver of written informed consent.",

Consistent with previous studies, most patients manifested as fever, dry cough and short of breath [2] [3] [4] . The patterns of radiological appearance were bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations [7] . All these features resemble with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [8, 9] . However, patients with COVID-19 can present as mild disease or even no symptom, and no lung abnormalities or severe pneumonia on chest CT images. We reported a family cluster infection and some confirmed cases did not have comorbidities and the history of visiting to Wuhan, suggesting human-to-human transmission has been occurred outside of Wuhan regardless of age and underlying conditions [10] [11] [12] . Compared with patients in Wuhan, the manifestations of patients in Henan province are relatively mild [2] [3] [4] , which was consistent with 13 case series of COVID-19 in Beijing [5] . Notably, transmission in asymptomatic carrier has been reported [12] , which might pose more threat than symptomatic patients to epidemic prevention and control.",

It was worth mentioning that we only used the throat-swab specimen to detect the viral RNA. Evidence have showed that SARS-CoV-2, SARS or MERS RNA could be detected in both upper and lower respiratory tract samples, even in blood, stool and urine specimens [2, 13, 14] .

Regarding infection markers, evaluated C-reactive protein (>5.0mg/L; 12 [75%] patients) was very common. In contrast, 4 [25%] had procalcitonin above the normal range (>0.046 ng/ml). 15 patients had pneumonia with 11 (73.3%) showing as bilateral lung involvement and the remaining (3 [16.7%]) had normal chest CT. Of the 15 patients with pneumonia on chest CT, all had ground-glass opacities, and 7 (46.6%) also had consolidation. As of Feb 7, 6 (33.3%) patients had been discharged and all the other patients were still in the hospital; and 13 (72.2%) had been fully symptomatic remission and one had developed to severe respiratory failure and been transferred to the ICU. And one in the ICU on admission had been transferred to general isolated ward on the eighth day of admission. The median time from symptom onset to admission was 7 days (range 2-15). Of 13 fully symptomatic remission patients, the median time from illness onset to symptom remission was 10 days (range 3-15). Of 6 discharged patients, the median time of RT-PCR conversion were 19.5 days (range 17-24) and interval for two chest CT scans 12.5 days (range 10-15). 5 (83.3%) had significant radiological improvement at the time of RT-PCR conversion and the remaining one had no change on chest CT image (figure 1).",

Further data on ascertaining the duration of infectivity of COVID-19 by monitoring RT-PCR status in differing levels of severity using multiple clinical specimens are merited. Nevertheless, patients with COVID-19 should continue to follow hygiene measures after discharge from hospital, including wearing a surgical mask, disinfection of food utensils and toilet disinfection. For patients with mild pneumonia, radiological abnormalities were significantly improved in most patients after RT-PCR conversion. However, the consistency between RT-PCR conversion and the resolution of lung abnormalities requires further studies in patients with critical illness. In summary, the COVID-19 can present a variety of manifestations ranging from no symptoms or mild disease to resolved or severe pneumonia. RT-PCR conversion was compatible with improvement of radiological abnormalities. Large studies are urgently needed to explore the duration of infectivity and related factors of COVID-19.",
