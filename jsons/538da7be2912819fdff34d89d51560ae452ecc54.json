To analyze the role of the immune response against defined MHV-JHM antigens, we tested the protective efficacy of vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing either the nucleocapsid (N) or the spike (S) protein. A strong protection was mediated in animals by immunization with recombinant VV encoding a wild-type S protein (VV-Swildtype), whereas VV recombinant expressing a mutant S 3 5 4~~ protein (VV-S354~~) had no protective effect. Recombinant VV encoding N protein (VV-N) induces a humoral and a CD4+ Tcell response, but did not prevent acute disease regardless of the immunization protocol. In these experiments, challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of MHV-JHM was performed prior to the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies and studies with the anti-CD8+ monoclonal antibody, MRC OX8 showed that elimination of the CD8+ subset of Tcells abrogates the protective effect.

Furthermore, we detected no pathological changes in histological analysis of brain tissue from those rats dissected at various time points after MHV-JHM challenge (data not shown). We assume therefore that neutralizing antibodies are not the essential factor in mediating protection during the acute stage of disease. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that antibodies produced within the CNS of MHV-JHM-infected rats do not prevent the onset of acute viral encephalomyelitis [26, 271. In mice, CD8+ CTL are the predominant effector cells for elimination of infected cells [15, 161. To find out whether activated, S protein-specific CD8+ T cells are capable of restricting virus spread, CD8+ T cells were eliminated from VV Swi~dtype-immunized rats by treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Similar to VV-wt-immunized control rats, animals which were CD8 depleted died within 7 to 9 days after MHV-JHM challenge. In experiments employing a less efficient depletion of CD8+ T cells we observed that VV-Swildtype-immunized rats remained protected if a low percentage of CD8+ Tcells were detectable (data not shown).

The results vary to some extent, if different systems and immunization schedules are considered. For example, immunization with purified influenza nucleoprotein (NP) can induce protection, whereas vaccination with a VV-recombinant expressing NP induced no protective immunity [33, 341. In our experiments, a nucleocapsidspecific humoral and CD4+ T cell response was induced by VV-N [18] . A low delay in death was noticed in VV-N vaccinated rats compared to control animals (data not shown). But nevertheless vaccination with the VV-N recombinant did not prevent acute disease regardless of the immunization protocol. However, we assume that the N-specific CD4+ T cell response has an important function to promote cellular immune response since recent data demonstrate that the N protein is a dominant Tcell antigen in rats and mice [17, 18, 351. The protection mediated by VV-Swildtype is dependent on the presence of S-specific CD8+ T cells and without essential participation of antibodies. As an indirect measure for a specific CD4+ T cell response, we established Tcell lines from VV recombinant immunized rats and measured their specificity by proliferation assays. Although S-specific CD4+ Tcells are demonstrable in lymphoid organs from rats diseased with SDE [17] , no such response was observed following immunization with VV-Swildtype and V V -S~~~C R . By contrast, VV-N elicits a specific CD4+ Tcell response [18] . Furthermore, the biological potential of activated, MHV-JHM protein-specific CD4+ T cells to mediate protection was revealed by transfer experiments [17, 181. Therefore, for unprimed rats efficient virus elimination and survival of the acute disease stage require both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, whereby the relative impact of each subset may strongly depend on the epitope specificity for each MHV protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 410, "text": "[33, 341.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 959, "end": 972, "text": "[17, 18, 351.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1398, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1552, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1713, "text": "[17, 181.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Biochemistry and Biology of Coronaviruses", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Wege", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Koga", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Wege", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Ter Meulen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1981, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF22": {"ref_id": "b22", "title": "DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Mackett", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Smith", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Moss", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1985, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF33": {"ref_id": "b33", "title": "Proc.
