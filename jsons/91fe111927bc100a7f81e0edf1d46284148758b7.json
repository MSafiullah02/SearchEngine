            "text": "Early advances in either Chemistry or Biology progressed independently among the disciplines, thus, without the benefit of a mutual impact. Today, however, boundaries of (Organic) Chemistry and Biology have been blurred as knowledge and techniques are quickly interchanged and adopted. Natural Product Chemists analyze newly sequenced genomes for clues to previously undiscovered bioactive molecules or biosynthetic pathways. Biologists identify molecules, which regulate signaling events, during cell development and control interactions among species. Synthetic Organic Chemists rely on biological assays to guide the design of molecules to be used as ligands tightly binding to enzymes and protein receptors. Various techniques of Physical Organic Chemistry and Molecular Biology are applied to enzymes and other biomolecules to gain some understanding of their structures, functions and mechanisms of action at levels earlier accessible only to small molecules. [1] This flow of intellect, so to speak, between the disciplines, would not have been realized, had both of them not been in partnership. Chemical Biology, i. e. the application of Chemistry to elucidate problems of Biology at the molecular level, was, thus, born. The significance and power of this partnership has been amply demonstrated in the post-genomics era.",

Furthermore, they attempt to mimic nature by identifying compounds to fit the structural constraints of the target's binding site(s).",

[28] A special issue on the spectroscopy of H-bonded systems, describing excited state dynamic interactions has been published recently. [29] Symmetry is of significance for an H-bond. [30] H-bonded sites of the same proton affinity raise the question of an Hbond equidistant from both ends, i. e. either midway or closer to one of them, hopping in rapid equilibrium. These possibilities correspond to double-well or single-well potentials.",

The study has been based on homologous diols in their ring-like conformation (i. e., a 5-, 6-& a 7-ring conformation) (Figure 4 ). Geometry and IR spectroscopy secure an intramolecular Hbond. It has, thus, been suggested that a bcp is only one of the criteria to assess the existence of a bond. The question of the nature of H-bond as a true bond or just a weak interaction, in the form of an energy continuum, remains a strongly debated issue. [32] [33] [34] Imaging methods such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been called in to \"see\" H-bonding. [35] Not only the \"revered\" O\u00c0 H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OH bonds have been unveiled but also C\u00c0H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and C\u00c0 H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N ones with C\u00c0H groups as donors.

Both intermolecular and intramolecular PTs in H-bonded systems have received much attention, theoretically and experimentally, [12, 39, 40] either as a single PT [41, 42] or a multiple one, [43] [44] [45] [46] using prototype molecules. It is found in rearrangement reactions, protein functions, enzyme reactions or across proton channels and pumps. Many experimental and theoret-ical reports, as well as book chapters and reviews, have been devoted to PT along H-bonds. [47] Tunneling (a quantum effect of going through and not over an energy reaction barrier), [48] transport in water molecules [49] or hopping (or \"hop-turn\" or Grotthuss mechanism) [50] are the currently accepted proton relay modes. Interestingly, examples of PT, occurring without engaging H-bonds, have recently been encountered. [51] Investigations have also focused on PT processes in the excited state (ESIPT). [52, 53] The concept of proton (PT) and electron transfer (ET) is of growing interest in addressing energy issues such as conversion processes [54] or even deciphering the mechanism of many natural and synthetic processes. [55] What is more important is that the PT and ET may be a coupled process (PCET). Ongoing research focuses on the possibility that the two transfers proceed concertedly (CPET) instead of following a stepwise pathway. [56] H-bond Acidity and Basicity",

A distinct departure from this trend, known as SOMO catalysis, has been developed by Mac-Millan. [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] Molecular recognition, of paramount importance to biocatalysis (i. e. enzyme catalysis, see also below Enzyme & Cocktail Catalysis), rests upon anion sensing, [152] binding [153] and stabilization. [153] Non covalent interactions, H-bonding in particular, [154] play a major role in these life-sustaining biological process. Their significance and potential to the catalytic activity of enzymes has been appreciated relatively recently. [155] [156] [157] Enzyme Catalysis H-bonding to an electrophile decreases the electron density of that species, activating it towards nucleophilic attack. This principle is employed frequently by enzymes in the acceleration of a wide range of chemical processes. Enzyme catalysis has long been considered to rival intramolecularity. [158] The focus of that correlation has been on the high reaction rates observed in both types of processes (up to 10 8 -10 10 -10 18 !). Proximity of reacting centers in either intramolecular reactions via covalent forces or enzymic reactions via non covalent interactions, has been the core theme of a long debated discordance on these similarities. Fredric Menger [159] and Thomas C. Bruice [160] have elegantly laid out the relevant arguments. The combined effects of enzymes and organocatalysts have been eloquently reviewed. [161] Organic Chemists have always viewed enzymes as organic catalysts. That is certainly true and in the words of J. Knowles \"\u2026enzymes are no different from other catalysts, only better\u2026\" The statement, put in such a captivatingly simple way, reflects the proficiency of enzymes to effect transformations, smoothly, complex ones among them, stereoselectively, fast, under mild conditions and quite often in high yields.",

[162] Several studies have been reported on the kinetic and energetic aspects of enzymic activity. Low Barrier H-bonds (LBHBs) have been considered as a major factor. [163] The dominant view, nowadays, is that of a multi-factorial regime of interactions. [163, 164] Nuclear quantum tunneling and dynamics have been invoked in enzyme-catalyzed H transfer reactions. [164] Many redox processes are accompanied by proton content changes at enzyme active sites. Getting a grasp of such a reactivity path is a current chemical challenge.

The latter prevails if the Hbond energy in the complex and the entropy gain from water release is more favorable than the free energy contributed by the H-bonded binding partners and water molecules (Figure 11 ). [174] [175] [176] Ligands interacting with functionalities of a binding site, through H-bonds, bind in a specific orientation. The H-bonding interactions demand optimum distances and angles.

Perturbation of this backbone pattern has been recently described as a means to assess the contribution of H-bonding to binding interactions. [180] Of particular interest is the H-bond furcation, [181] a common phenomenon in protein-ligand binding, observed in the active sites of their complexes, ranging from bi-to hexa-furcated geometries (see also sections 2.1 & 2.2).",

Recent findings, however, seem to be compatible to a rather fast diffusion through the membrane's hydration layer. [197] H-bonding also contributes to membrane protein folding and stability. Experiment has shown that the H-bonding contribution to stability in watersoluble proteins is only ca. 1 kcalmol \u00c01 .
