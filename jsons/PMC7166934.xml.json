At the molecular level, HBV is characterized by significant genetic heterogeneity comprising ten genotypes, A to J, with average inter\u2010genotype nucleotide diversity of 8%.2 Genotype C is further divided into four sub\u2010genotypes with ~4% nucleotide diversity between them.3\n",

In Korea, genotype C constitutes almost 100% of the infections,8 approximately 50% in Hong Kong,9 and 85% in Japan.10 In Mainland China, genotype C is predominant in the Northern part of China (Beijing, Xingjiang and Gansu), while genotype B is prevalent in the Central and Eastern part of China (Hunan and Fujian), with an overall prevalence of 41% for genotype B and 53% for genotype C.11 Similarly in Taiwan, where HBV genotype B is the most prevalent (68%), genotype C still accounts for almost one\u2010third of the infections (32%).12 Several sub\u2010genotypes with specific molecular epidemiology patterns have been described within HBV/C.

Previous studies based on Bayesian coalescent analysis estimated the HBV evolutionary rate to be approximately 10\u22124\u201010\u22125 nucleotide substitutions/site/year21, 22 and traced back the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the currently circulating human genotypes to ~1500 years ago, which in turn separated from the avian HBV lineage ~6000 years ago.21 However, specific genotypes, or lineages within genotypes responsible for current outbreaks, may have a more recent origin, and their successful spread could be the result of specific historical or geopolitical correlates during the past decades potentially related to an unprecedented increase in human mobility. Therefore, our main objective was to infer the origin and epidemic history of HBV/C in East Asia and investigate ecological factors affecting dissemination and epidemic outbreaks of the virus.",

Genotyping classification was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree reconstruction, with the GTR nucleotide substitution model, gamma\u2010distributed rate heterogeneity among sites (GTR + G), and 1000 bootstrap replicates, from an alignment including the full\u2010genome sequences obtained from GenBank and well\u2010established genotype (A to J) reference strains (accession numbers shown in Table S1). Calculations were carried out within MEGA6 software.24 Data collection times of HBV sequences included in the full\u2010genome data set (n = 429) spanned from 1992 to 2010. To ensure that a specific country was not falsely over\u2010represented in the alignment, a sampling ratio was calculated using the proportion of genotype C in chronic HBV cases (China 53%, Korea 98%, Japan 85%, Taiwan 32%, USA 41%) normalized by HBV prevalence in the general population of each country (China 10%,25 Korea 5.9%,26 Japan 4%,27 Taiwan 15%,28 USA 15%,20, 29 which resulted in a sampling ratio China:Korea:Japan:Taiwan:USA of 1.6:1.7:1:1.4:1.8. Sequences were, then, randomly selected from each country according to this ratio to generate an alignment including a final alignment of 120 strains representative of the virus prevalence in each country spanning from 1992 to 2010 (see Table S2) to infer maximum likelihood (ML) trees, NJ trees and Bayesian coalescent inference.",

Bifurcating nodes with posterior probability greater than 0.95 were considered statistically well supported. Six different evolutionary models were tested: strict vs relaxed molecular clock, each one with a constant size, exponential growth or Bayesian Skygrid (nonparametric) demographic prior.32 Depending on the model, MCMCs were run for 500 million to 1.5 billion generations (sampling every 0.01% of the run) until the effective sampling size of each parameter estimate (after burn\u2010in of 10%\u201025%, depending on the model) was >200 to ensure proper mixing of the Markov chain. For each run, the marginal likelihood was estimated via path sampling (PS) and stepping stone (SS) methods33 and the resulting Bayes Factors (BF) (ratio of marginal likelihoods) used to select the best\u2010fitting clock/demographic model.34 In practice, following the original work of Kass and Raftery,35 any two models can be compared to evaluate the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis (H\n0) defined in the following way: 2lnBF < 2 indicates no evidence against H\n0; 2\u20106, weak evidence; 6\u201010: strong evidence, and >10 very strong evidence.

A root\u2010to\u2010tip regression plot was inferred from the ML tree to test for the presence of temporal signal required for accurate reconstruction of node ages within the Bayesian phylogeny. The regression slope was positive, with a correlation coefficient being 0.151, which indicates sufficient temporal signal and suggests that a relaxed molecular clock is likely more appropriate than a strict clock model to explain HBV/C evolution. Indeed, Bayes Factor comparison of different clock models implemented in BEAST, using PS/SS methods to estimate the marginal likelihood, indicated that the relaxed molecular clock with gamma distribution and nonparametric Skygrid demographic models best fit the data (Table 1). Evolutionary history reconstruction using these models revealed a median evolutionary rate for the HBV/C full genome of 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 subs/site/year (95%HPD: 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20108.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 subs/site/year), in agreement with previous estimates.21 The overall topology of the Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree (Figure 3A) inferred from the data set is almost the same as ML and NJ phylogenies inferred from the full data set (Figure 1 and Figure S1). The majority of the available strains (99.5%) clustered within lineages 2 and 3, with lineage 2 primarily consisting of Japan and Korean isolates (60.9% of all available sequences within the clade), and lineage 3 of Chinese/Taiwanese isolates (70.5% of all available sequences within the clade) (Figure 3B). The HBV/C most recent common ancestor (MRCA) emerged in China in the mid\u20101940s with a 95% high posterior density interval (95% HPD) of 1901\u20101969. After an initial spread in China, three lineages emerged almost simultaneously around the 1950s (95%HPD 1932\u20101970, 1942\u20101970 and 1944\u20101970, respectively [Figure 4]). Lineage 1 gave rise to two separate introductions from China to Taiwan and from China to USA. Lineage 2 exhibited a transition from China to Japan, from where it disseminated in turn to Korea through several separate introductions. Lineage 3 appeared to circulate within China, from where it was further disseminated to Taiwan, through at least three separate introductions, and then to USA. No introduction from Japan into Taiwan was observed. Significantly supported viral migration routes (BF > 3) over 1992\u20102010, representing the spatial transitions in the MCC tree, are shown in Figure 4.",

Skygrid plots display changes in virus effective population size (Ne), which is a measure of viral diversity and is related to the number of new transmissions (incidence) over the sampling time period.38 The population demographic history, or changes in Ne over the evolutionary history in question, of lineages 2 and 3 was remarkably similar (Figure 5). Lineage 3 was characterized by overall viral effective population growth from 1980 to 1997 (a small and transient decrease was observed between 1989 and 1995) (Figure 5A). A sharp population bottleneck was then observed in 2003, followed by growth and potential stabilization (growing HPD intervals toward most recent sampling time) during the last decade (Figure 5A). Such a strong bottleneck usually associated with one or more than two major events relate to natural environment, human or epidemics. Coincidently, a wide affected emerging pathogen outbreak arose in East Asia in 2003. This newly emerging coronavirus caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV), leading to an outbreak in the area between Hong Kong and Guangdong in 2003. The fast transmission and high mortality rate caused worldwide attention. With the WHO and governments\u2019 propaganda continuously advising people to avoid the attendance of public events and to change travel plans to epidemic areas such as China and Taiwan,39 restrictions on tourism were tightened so as to reduce human contact. In order to analyse the potential impact of these travel restrictions on HBV/C spread, we collected travel numbers at customs in each East Asia country during the past three decades (Figure 6) for comparison with phylogeographic data. The total entry number at customs arrival point of China and Taiwan (the two countries where most of lineage 3 strains circulated) showed a rapid growth from 1981 to 2002. In 2003, during the SARS\u2010CoV epidemic, the number of arriving people had a loss of more than 6 million (97 908 252 people in 2002 vs 91 662 082 people in 2003) in China and 72 000 people in Taiwan (2 977 692 people in 2002 vs 2 248 117 people in 2003). The population dynamic of lineage 3 is highly correlating with the number of people entering each country (Pearson r = 0.829**, P < 0.001 for China; Pearson r = 0.879**, P < 0.001, for Taiwan) and leaving each country (Pearson r = 0.909**, P < 0.001 for China; Pearson r = 0.709**, P < 0.001, for Taiwan). The HBV/C population bottleneck occurred during the time frame of the SARS\u2010CoV epidemic40 and was followed by another substantial growth matching a new increase in human mobility in the aftermath of the SARS\u2010CoV epidemic (Figure 5).",

This is not only evident in the directional spread from China/Taiwan to Japan and from Japan to Korea, but also by the introduction of HBV/C strains in USA from China around the 1960s shown by our phylogeography analysis. The correlation of dissemination of virus out of China with neighbouring countries over the past three decades with human mobility indicates a prominent role for human travel in spreading disease in East Asia. In 1966, the \u201cProletarian Cultural Revolution\u2019\u2019 in China sparked public demonstrations, factional battles and government initiatives that resulted in waves of immigration to the USA,41, 42 exactly the same time frame of HBV/C introduction, according to our reconstruction.",

However, SARS\u2010CoV raised an outbreak in East Asia. It led to 774 deaths and 8098 infections and reached 30 countries in only a few months.43 The fast transmission and high mortality rate (9.6%)44 caused worldwide attention. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, hospitals with SARS cases and healthcare workers had been segregated.45 Thousands of people had been isolated in hospitals including medical staff. People who had the possibility of being in contact with SARS patients were requested to be isolated in their homes.46, 47 Under this social atmosphere, community fairs and gatherings were reduced, not only in the general population but also in PWID (patients with injecting drugs) and MSM (men having sex with men). Human contact and international population flow (eg, travel) are important factors in the genetic diversity supply to a blood\u2010transmitted virus such as HBV. When the effective population lacks income for a while, this would then be sharply reflected in phylodynamic analysis. Human\u2010contact\u2010caused environmental pressure for virus Ne is too hard to prove, but the pressure has left a trace on travelling numbers in every East Asia country.",

The analysis of human mobility data showed that, indeed, during the SARS\u2010CoV emergency, population movements in East Asia were strongly correlated with viral Ne fluctuation. The relatively limited decrease in the number of foreigners entering Japan and Korea may be due to the absence of Japan and Korea in the list of WHO travel advice recipients, also potentially explaining the moderate statistical correlation with the Ne of lineage 2. The significant decrease in people leaving the country during 2003, together with the phylogeography reconstruction showing directional HBV/C flow from Japan to Korea, provides a possible explanation for the temporary decrease in viral Ne. A similar conclusion could be drawn for the 2003 viral population bottleneck in the lineage mainly spreading in China with multiple introductions to Taiwan, which correlated with a reduced number of people entering Taiwan from China (155 872 people in 2002 vs 133 422 people in 2003).",

In this particular case, the restriction on human mobility caused by the rapid dissemination of SARS\u2010CoV may have resulted in a temporary decrease in the HBV/C effective population size. In other words, our data indicate that the co\u2010circulation of two pathogens targeting the same human population resulted in a complex dynamic wherein one outbreak effectively down\u2010modulated the other. A stochastic model of pathogen competition, co\u2010circulating in a spatially structured environment, has recently been proposed.49 By simulating two pathogens spreading through a travelling network with a stochastic mechanistic approach, the model investigated several complex scenarios where \u201cecological factors,\u201d such as host mobility, could be either noninfluential for the competition dynamics or play a critical role in selecting the dominant pathogen. The development of more realistic spatial ecology models of multiple, co\u2010circulating infectious diseases, as well as the monitoring and analysis of potentially competing epidemics, should be, therefore, a major focus for next\u2010generation epidemiology studies.",

Demographic inference of viral effective population size over time indicated similar dynamics for both lineages, characterized by exponential growth since the early 1980s, followed by a significant bottleneck in 2003 and another increase after 2004.
