            "text": "While we now have tremendous information on the frequency and distribution of neoplasia, there is still little definitive information on the causes of many common neoplasms in the ferret (as is often the case in human neoplasms). A large number of theories abound, but only rarely with supportive evidence. Three main schools of thought exist for ferrets, and it is likely that many neoplasms may be the result of several coexisting factors at once:1.Husbandry issues. The \u201cdomestication\u201d of the ferret as a pet species in many countries of the world involves varying degrees of environmental and surgical manipulation of the animal itself. Proof surrounding the effects of early neutering of ferrets and the subsequent development of adrenocortical neoplasia is now published and this mechanism is widely accepted.7., 53., 54. Dietary manipulation, especially the common practice of feeding high-carbohydrate diets and treats, has been suggested to be a primary cause for the increased incidence of insulinoma (when compared with the incidence in animals fed raw whole prey [rats, mice, etc.] as the dietary staple).53 Finally, the modern ferret owner\u2019s predilection for indoor housing and artificial lighting may also play a role in the development of certain types of neoplasms. In Europe, where most ferrets are housed outdoors and exposed to natural lighting cycles, the incidence of neoplasia, especially adrenocortical, is greatly decreased.53 However, other factors, including delayed neutering, may also affect the development of neoplasia in European ferrets.2.Genetic (familial) predisposition. While genetic or chromosomal aberrations are yet to be studied in domestic ferrets, the tremendous incidence of neoplasia in American bloodlines of ferrets as compared with their European counterparts certainly lends credence to this widely held belief. A recent case report by Fox22 documents a syndrome of multiple neoplasms in an adult ferret that closely resembles (multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 in humans, a condition known to be the result of a genetic point mutation.3.Infectious agents. Suspicious cluster outbreaks of malignant lymphoma in laboratory colonies and rescue operations3., 18. have sparked the investigation of a possible viral etiology for this neoplasm in ferrets. Transforming retroviruses are known to be responsible for the development of lymphoma in a number of other species, including humans, cats, and rabbits among others. Erdman20 demonstrated the transmissibility of this neoplasm between ferrets using cell-free inocula, thus furthering this theory, although a prolonged incubation time was required. Helicobacter mustelae, a ubiquitous inhabitant of the stomach of ferrets, has been circumstantially incriminated in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma33 (which is enhanced when coupled with the ingestion of chemical carcinogens as promoters)21., 23. as well as in the development of gastric B-cell (MALT) lymphomas.17 In addition, a progression from chronic inflammatory intestinal disease to neoplasia has been proposed in cats.70\n\n",

Pancreatic islet cell tumors (also known as insulinomas) are the most common neoplasms overall, with adrenocortical neoplasms being the second most common.18., 36., 37., 68. In all studies, lymphoma was both the most common hematopoietic neoplasm and the most common malignancy.8., 36., 37., 68. Between 12% and 20% of cases in each study had multiple tumor types, with insulinoma and adrenocortical carcinoma being seen concurrently most often.8., 36., 37., 68. However, the presence of multiple tumor types in an individual should not be interpreted as a neoplastic syndrome arising from a common tumorigenic mechanism. In a study of 66 cases in which ferrets had multiple concurrent neoplasms, Li36 found no evidence of an association between tumor type and multiplicity. Because endocrine neoplasia is extremely common in American ferrets today (and is increasing in global frequency), it comes as no surprise that middle-aged and geriatric ferrets have multiple tumors developing over time.",

True metastasis involves the translocation, either via blood or lymph, to another organ; this is seen in the dog and cat, where the metastasis of islet cell tumors to local lymph nodes, liver, or other visceral organs is common.

            "text": "The diagnosis of insulinoma is not exceedingly difficult in the ferret and is generally based on a combination of the characteristic clinical signs and a low fasting blood glucose level in the absence of a nonendocrine etiology (see Chapter 7). The hypoglycemia resulting from the inappropriate secretion of insulin by these tumors generally results in a constellation of neurologic signs ranging from mild (ataxia or disassociation from the surroundings) to severe (seizures, coma). Blood glucose levels of less than 60 mg/dL in the ferret are generally diagnostic for insulinoma even in the absence of clinical signs. Some individuals may present with a history of neurologic disease and a normal fasting blood glucose; in the early stages of this condition, insulin release may be sporadic and clinical signs may be intermittent. The determination of insulin levels is rarely indicated prior to institution of therapy and is of no value in cases where blood glucose is above 60 mg/dL. Therapeutic approaches for the treatment of insulinoma in ferrets are widely reported. In our experience, surgical excision is the preferred course of treatment for symptomatic animals with documented hypoglycemia. In a clinical study,62 partial pancreatectomy yielded the longest disease-free intervals and survival times (365 and 668 days, respectively), followed by simple nodulectomy (234 and 456 days, respectively), although surgery did not eliminate the need for concurrent medical management in all cases. Medical treatment alone resulted in a mean disease free interval of 22 days and a mean survival time of 186 days.",

Excision of the vena cava carries a high risk of complications including renal failure and death, and these risks are greater than the risk of death from adrenal disease. While presurgical ultrasound examination may be used to identify the side (or sides) at which an affected neoplasm is located, the absence of adrenomegaly or an identifiable nodule via ultrasound does not obviate the need for surgery in affected individuals, since functional lesions may be present in normal-sized adrenal glands.6\n",

Epitheliotropic lymphoma is commonly seen in the feet and extremities of ferrets, resulting in grossly swollen, hyperemic, alopecic feet.

Any patient receiving chemotherapy who develops neutropenia (WBC < 1000/\u03bcL) should receive prophylactic antibiotics. If fever develops, hospitalize the patient immediately for intravenous antibiotic and fluid administration; this is a true oncologic emergency. Patients who are hospitalized under these circumstances generally respond well within 24 to 36 hours, while those that do not receive intravenous antibiotic therapy may suffer from more serious effects and prolonged recovery or even death. If either of these adverse effects occurs, separate the interval for administration (if multiple drugs were administered concurrently) to determine which drug is responsible for the adverse effect and decrease the dosage by 20% for future administrations.",

While these neoplasms may be seen at any site in the body, the tissues of the head (and, interestingly, the eyelid) appear to be a common site of origin.

Perform wide surgical excision of these tumors as soon as possible after diagnosis, as growth in areas with high skin tension may result in large defects that are difficult to close.

Sophisticated techniques may yield clues to a tumor cell\u2019s origin even if it does not resemble the parent tissue. Immunohistochemical procedures to identify tissue specific intermediate filaments or ultrastructural analysis of cellular organelles by electron microscopy may identify characteristic organelles for a particular cell type. Today, the use of these advanced techniques at large referral laboratories lends insight into the origin of a particular neoplasm; in doing so, it provides important information concerning therapeutic approaches and prognosis. However, many smaller laboratories are not equipped to perform these tests routinely, and a broad diagnosis of \u201cpoorly differentiated\u201d carcinoma, sarcoma, or round cell tumor is often the result.",

Sarcomas of the skin were the largest single classification of poorly differentiated tumors but likely the most responsive to treatment (i.e., surgery). As sarcomas of the skin tend to have low metastatic potential, a definitive identification of cell of origin (smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, fibrocyte, etc.) is of little clinical importance. However, the remainder of the poorly differentiated neoplasms generally carry a poor prognosis, especially those present in abdominal organs.",

Instead, samples can be obtained from the humerus or femur with a standard bone marrow biopsy instrument, but the technique must be modified because these lack beveled tips (open arrow)(A).

Both cortices of bone are penetrated and the needle is advanced through the skin on the opposite side of the limb (B). Without removing the needle, a collection cassette is placed at the tip of the needle; the stylet is then introduced (open arrowhead) to expel the core bone biopsy (closed arrowhead)(C, D).
