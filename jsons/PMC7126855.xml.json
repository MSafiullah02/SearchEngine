More than 30 million children in the world are not immunized against treatable or preventable diseases (www.care.org/campaigns/childrenpowerty/facts.asp) because the currently used approaches to vaccine production are technologically complex and expensive. Specialized requirements of packaging, cold chain and mode of delivery add to the cost. This makes vaccination unaffordable to a large proportion of population in developing and poor economies. Currently used mammalian cell line based vaccine manufacturing requires large investment and expertise. These factors limit their scale up and thus, global availability. These problems are also equally important for the vaccination of farm animals (Floss et al., 2007). A fresh thinking is required to make vaccine development, manufacture and delivery simpler and affordable.",

These comprised of proteins derived from pathogenic viruses, bacteria or parasites. Although mammals, their tissues and cell lines are currently utilized for commercial production of vaccines, these systems are expensive and their scale up is not easy (Larrick and Thomas, 2001, Houdebine, 2009). Toxins, infectious agents and other noxious compounds get carried in animal cell based processes and are often difficult to remove. Such production systems are prone to microbial contamination which sometimes escapes detection even in purified vaccines. Expression of recombinant antigen proteins in E.coli is often not feasible because of lack of a variety of post translational modifications and folding requirements. Some of the mammalian-type post translational processing and modifications in protein happen in yeast and insect cell lines. However, immunologically significant differences in the pattern of post translational modifications limit their deployment in the expression of vaccine antigens (Streatfield and Howard, 2003a, Streatfield and Howard, 2003b, Chen et al., 2005, Houdebine, 2009). As a major alternative, plants are emerging as a promising system to express and manufacture a wide range of functionally active proteins of high value to health industry.",

            "text": "The original concept of edible vaccines implied that transgenic fruit or vegetable expressing an antigen from a virus or bacteria can be eaten raw without any previous processing, and act as a vaccine for launching sufficiently protective immune response against a particular disease. Currently, it is widely accepted that this original concept was rather naive mainly because of two reasons. First, different fruits from the same plant express different levels of antigens and therefore it is crucial to make plant-derived vaccine by using pools of fruits with homogeneous antigen concentration (vaccine dose). In general, at least a minimum processing, pooling and freeze-drying of fruits from the same or different plants will be required before incorporation into formulations or capsules for oral vaccination. Second, it is important to ensure complete separation of fruits or vegetables intended for human or animal consumption from fruits or vegetables intended for pharmaceutical uses like vaccines. Hence, the approach to \u201cedible vaccines\u201d has been replaced by \u201cplant-derived vaccine antigens\u201d. Antigen expression in plant tissue opens an important alternative to meet the global demand for cheaper, safer and quality vaccines. Compartmentalization of vaccine antigens in plant cell, tissue or organ can provide it a protective covering. This can facilitate transportation without expensive infrastructure to the manufacturing site where dose standardization and packaging may be undertaken. Such edible encapsulation protects the antigen through the mucosal and gut systems to allow its absorption.",

Genetically modified plants can be grown in large area. Large biomass can be obtained easily without high investment (Kusnadi et al., 1998, Evangelista et al., 1998, Chen et al., 2005, Yonekura-Sakakibara and Saito, 2006). The cost of goods sold (COGS) for bulk production of recombinant protein in plants has been estimated to be 1/10th to 1/50th of bacterial fermentation (Hood et al., 2002). Therefore it is economically sound to use transgenic plants for antigen production. A variety of gene expression and protein localization systems now available for plants allows stable accumulation of the recombinant proteins in target plant tissue.",

The expression levels of the recombinant proteins in the transgenic plants are also influenced by environmental factors. High expression levels could be best achieved in cell suspension, hairy root cultures (in vitro) and seeds (in vivo). Seed tissue represents potentially a very promising target for producing pharmaceutically important proteins for extraction at commercial level. The recombinant seeds also offer the possibility of direct use as an edible vaccine. Single chain antibodies expressed in seeds of rice and wheat showed high biological activities and remained stable for several years (Stoger et al., 2005). Thus, the proteins expressed in seeds are highly stable. Long term storage and easy transportability of seeds is possible due to very low moisture content of mature seeds. Rich mix of chaperones and disulfide isomerases present in the developing seed facilitate correct protein folding (Muntz, 1998). Other tissues like hairy root and cell suspension cultures could be useful target tissues to express recombinant proteins (Kumar et al., 2005b, Kumar et al., 2006, Benchabane et al., 2008), though the establishment and running costs of such in vitro systems are higher.",

            "text": "One of the most important aspects in molecular bio-farming is the selection of promoter to achieve high level expression of the antigen coding gene. The choice of promoters affects transgene transcription, resulting in changes not only in concentration, but also in the stage, tissue and cell specificity of its expression. Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter has widely been used because of its strong and constitutive expression. High level protein expression is essential to develop economically competitive plant-based process for cultivation of the transgenic variety within confines fields with controlled environmental and contained biosafety conditions. However, expression in tissues other than the target organ to be used for preparation of the vaccine antigen is an avoidable drain on plant resources. In this respect, highly expressing and yet tightly controlled promoters are desirable for bio-farming proteins from plants (Fischer et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Stoger et al., 2005). Expression of a protein with CaMV35S promoter does not permit regulated gene expression. Though CaMV35S promoter expresses genes at a relatively high level in leaves and roots, low level of total protein (2\u20135% on fresh weight basis) in these tissues gives a poor expression system, not suitable for bio-farming. Using CaMV35S promoter, expression levels of about 0.2% of total soluble protein (TSP) have been reported in leaves. Using a two component expression systems (Chaturvedi et al., 2007), our laboratory has reported protein expression to about 1% of total protein in tobacco seeds. However, by developing a seed specific expression system the expression of vaccine antigen at 1% of total protein can give more than hundred fold higher total yield of the target antigen per unit area as compared to the expression in leaf (Table 1\n). Levels of expression, as high as 20% of TSP, have been reported by expressing transgenes in chloroplasts. One acre of chloroplast transgenic tobacco plants have been estimated to produce up to 360 million doses of anthrax vaccine antigens (Koya et al., 2005). This can allow fairly high harvest of protein from leaf biomass. However, due to bacteria-like post translational processing, chloroplasts may not be suitable for expressing a large number of mammalian antigens. For example, glycosylation of proteins often determines solubility, stability and immunogenicity of antigens and chloroplasts do not have the glycosylation machinery. Table 1 gives theoretical calculations to approximately reflect the economics of expressing vaccine antigen in chloroplasts, leaves and seeds, taking peanut (groundnut) as a model plant. Assuming that 5 \u00b5g antigen may comprise one dose of a vaccine, it should be possible to vaccinate 468 million individuals from one acre produce, using seed-based expression system! An amazingly impressive possibility, worth a serious attempt, even if the calculations needs tens of fold correction to account for the processing and purification losses. Absence of pigments and phenolics in seeds make protein purification easier as compared to that from the leaves. Various seed specific promoters, mainly derived from seed storage protein genes, have been employed to restrict recombinant protein expression to different parts of the seed (Perrin et al., 2000, De Jaeger et al., 2002, Philip et al., 2001). The trans-protein accumulation in protein body of seeds facilitates stability of protein against cytoplasmic proteolytic degradation. Soybean seed specific glycinin and endosperm specific glutelin (GluB-1) promoters were employed for LTB expression in soybean cotyledon protein bodies (Moravec et al., 2007) and CTB expression in rice seed protein bodies (Nochi et al., 2007), respectively.",

While the modern recombinant vaccines, particularly the highly purified or synthetic antigens require adjuvants to induce a protective and long-lasting immune response. Although aluminum salts are the most commonly used adjuvant for human vaccines, they are weak and have complex mechanisms that favor induction of antibodies rather than cellular immunity. New forms of vaccine adjuvants that have been proposed for various vaccines feature oil-based emulsions; bacterial products (Vibrio cholarae toxin B subunit, E. coli heat labile enterotoxin B subunit or CpG nucleotides); viral products (virus-like particles); plant products (saponin derivatives); biodegradable particles (liposomes); molecular adjuvants; and synthetic adjuvants (Lambrecht et al., 2009, Reed et al., 2009).",

The safety of proposed adjuvants is a primary consideration. Therefore it is often necessary to devise methods to reduce or eliminate the reactogenic effects of an adjuvant while preserving the efficacy. The most effective use of adjuvants for certain types of vaccines, particularly for stimulating mucosal immunity, may be to combine the adjuvant with a particular mode of delivery, such as oral, intranasal, or transcutaneous immunization. Carriers that carry and combine both the adjuvant and the antigen in a single formulation can serve as the basis for creation of important formulations for improved vaccines.",

General immune-stimulators (adjuvants) and better targeting to the immune system might compensate in part for low delivery of antigen. One of the targeting strategies involves linking antigens to molecules that bind well to immune system components such as M cells in the intestinal lining. M cells take up antigens that enter the small intestine and pass them to other cells of the immune system. If white blood cells (helper T lymphocytes) recognize the fragments as foreign, they induce B lymphocytes (B cells) to secrete neutralizing antibodies and initiate other strategies against the perceived enemy. The V. cholarae toxin B subunit (CTB) and E. coli heat labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) are potent mucosal immunogens and adjuvants. They both bind directly to the GM1-ganglioside receptor molecules on M cells by fusing antigens from other pathogens to any of these subunits (Cuatrecasas, 1973). This ushers foreign antigen into the M cells. By fusing antigens to this subunit, it is possible to improve uptake of antigens by M cells and enhance immune responses. The carrier molecules also serve to modulate immune response against watery diarrhea (Yasuda et al., 2003). Expression of cholera toxin B sub-unit fused to rabies glycoprotein antigen has been reported by us in peanut using seed specific expression system (Tiwari, 2008). The transgenic seeds showed a high expression of the functional fusion protein (unpublished data). Work is in progress to examine if the transgenic peanut seeds give active protection against rabies virus and V. cholerae.\n",

It remains a threat in developing countries where access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation is not available. The structure of cholera toxin (CT) is typical of the A\u2013B subunit group of toxins in which B subunit serves to bind the holotoxin to the eukaryotic cell receptor and A subunit possesses a specific enzymatic function that acts intracellularly. The mature B subunit contains 103 amino acids with a subunit mass of 11.6 kDa. The interaction of CTB with receptors is perhaps the most extensively studied and well characterized function of the toxin (Cuatrecasas, 1973, Fishman, 1982, Dalziel et al., 1984, Fukuta et al., 1988, Cai and Yang, 2003, Dawson, 2005). CTB is responsible for inducing both mucosal and serum immunity. Since the cholera toxin is internalized by the receptors present on mucosal lining, the CTB was one of the early toxins selected for testing the concept of edible vaccines. Further, CTB being a bacterial protein is not glycosylated in native form. Hence, its feasibility for developing vaccine anbtigen has been examined by expressing the gene in plants both by transformation in to chloroplastic and nuclear genome. In some cases, CTB fusions with target antigens have been used as a potent mucosal immunogen and adjuvant because of its high binding affinity for the GM1-ganglioside receptor in mucosal epithelium.",

The tobacco leaves expressed CTB protein at 0.02% of TSP. The leaf expressed protein when given to mice by intradermal route behaved like native CTB with regard to effects on T-cell proliferation and cytokine level. We reported CTB expression in tobacco leaves to 0.58% of TSP. The fusion of ubiquitin at N-terminal end increases the level further to 0.91% of TSP (Mishra et al., 2006). Li et al.

(2008) expressed CTB under the control of E8 promoter in tomato and tobacco plants. They observed that E8 promoter tightly regulated expression of CTB only in ripened tomato fruit but not in tobacco tissues. They concluded that certain DNA binding protein(s) (E4/E8-binding protein) may have increased during fruit ripening in tomato to increase expression. Nochi et al. (2007) developed rice based oral vaccine for cholera. They expressed CTB under the control of endosperm specific GluB-1 promoter and showed that each seed stored an average of 30 \u00b5g CTB. The experiments on oral feeding of transgenic rice seeds to mice induced CTB specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies with neutralizing activity. Rice-expressed CTB was stable and maintained immunogenicity at room temperature for more than 1.5 years. Therefore, the development of vaccine in edible plant organ is a cost effective and safe strategy. We reported (Mishra et al., 2006) that the CTB expressed in tobacco leaves was glycosylated. The plant expressed glycosylted CTB bound to the receptors with a higher affinity than the native bacterial protein. From the higher molecular mass of plant-expressed CTB published in earlier works, we interpreted that the bacterial protein expressed in those cases was also likely to be glycosylated. The results suggest the need for pharmacokinetic and biosafety studies on vaccine antigens expressed in plant systems.",

            "text": "Heat labile enterotoxic E. coli (ETEC) protein structure and function is nearly similar to that of the cholera toxin (Sixma et al., 1991). ETEC infection and colonization in the small intestine cause acute diarrhea. The toxin is made of two subunits, one is heat labile toxin A (LTA), which is a toxic subunit of 27 kDa and the other is heat labile toxin B (LTB) which exists as a non-toxic doughnut-shaped pentamer of 11.6 kDa essential for binding to GM1 gangliosides on intestinal epithelial cells (Tsuji et al., 1985). LTB is a potent mucosal immunogen and is commonly used as an adjuvant to stimulate antibody response, when co-expressed with other antigens. LTB and its genetic fusions with other proteins have been successfully expressed in tobacco, potato, maize, tomato, Arabidopsis thaliana, soybean and carrot (Haq et al., 1995, Mason et al., 1998, Chikwamba et al., 2002, Walmsley et al., 2003, Rigano et al., 2004, Moravec et al., 2007, Rosales-Mendoza et al., 2008). Mason et al. (1998) demonstrated the oral immunogenicity in potato tubers against LT. They expressed synthetic and plant based codon optimized LTB gene in potato plants under the control of CaMV35S promoter. The raw tubers fed to mice stimulated strong serum and mucosal antibody response against LTB and provided protection against oral challenge with LT. Chikwamba et al. (2002) expressed LTB in maize kernels using a seed endosperm specific (gamma zein) promoter. They demonstrated that the maize-synthesized LTB had a similar affinity for GM1 gangliosides, as the bacterial-synthesized LTB. Mice feeding experiments showed that the maize-synthesized LTB stimulated a protective immune response against LT and its closely related cholera toxin (CT). Rigano et al. (2004) reported the expression of a fusion protein consisting of the LTB and a 6 kDa tuberculosis antigen in transgenic A. thaliana. Both components of the fusion protein were expressed under the control of CaMV35S promoter and detected using GM1-ELISA. Thus, the fusion protein retained its native form. Moravec et al. (2007) reported high level accumulation (2.4% of the total seed protein) of LTB in transgenic soybean seed. Seed specific glycinin promoter was used to target protein in soybean seeds. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence (KDEL) attached at the 3' end of the transgene increases the stability of active heterologous protein. Soybean-based LTB is assembled correctly into pentamers that were bound to GM1, and were highly immunogenic when used in a prime-boost immunization strategy. Recently Rosales-Mendoza et al. (2008) expressed LTB encoded synthetic gene driven by the CaMV35S promoter in tap roots of adult carrot plants. Due to high homology between LT and CT, ingestion of transformed carrot material induces LTB-specific intestinal and systemic antibodies in mice and provided protection against oral LT as well as CT challenge.",

            "text": "The HBV is a double stranded DNA virus in the Hepadnaviridae family. The HBV genome includes four genes: pol, env, precore, and X which encode the viral DNA polymerase, envelope protein, precore protein (which is processed to viral capsid), and protein X, respectively. The most recent vaccine is based on the cloned copies of the env gene in yeast (Kapusta et al., 1999). The env gene codes for three related proteins: (i) S protein; (ii) pre-S1 protein (iii) pre-S2 protein. The analysis of blood from hepatitis B virus carriers reveals the presence of 22 nm particles consisting of a viral envelope surface (S) protein. The S antigenic protein plays an important role in the process of virus infection and the induction of a defensive host response. First report on the development of hepatitis vaccine in plants was published by Mason et al. (1992) where tobacco plants were genetically engineered by introducing HBsAg under the control of a CaMV35S constitutive promoter. However, low expression levels of only upto 0.01% of total leaf soluble protein were reported. The HBsAg has been expressed in lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) callus and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) leaves (Kapusta et al., 1999) also. Rather low HBsAg expression at levels of 150 ng/g fresh weight in lupin callus and 5.5 ng/g fresh weight in lettuce leaves were obtained, yet the mice fed with transgenic lupin tissue developed significant level of hepatitis B virus-specific antibodies. Human volunteers, fed with transgenic lettuce plants expressing hepatitis B virus surface antigen also developed specific serum-IgG response. Shchelkunov et al. (2006) expressed a synthetic chimeric fusion gene encoding the immunogenic ENV and GAG epitopes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and HBsAg under the control of CaMV35S promoter in tomato plants. Dried transgenic tomato fruits containing the chimeric antigen were fed to mice. Plant based oral vaccine against the two viruses elicited immune responses in the test animal. Recently, Qian et al. (2008) expressed SS1 gene that encodes a protein which consists of pre-S1 protein fusion with the truncated C-terminus of HBsAg protein. The expression of the fusion protein was controlled by seed specific GluB-4 promoter in rice seeds and highest expression level reported was to 31.5 ng/g dry weight of rice grains. This recombinant SS1 protein induced immunological response against S and preS1 protein in mice. He et al. (2008) expressed Hepatitis B virus surface antigen middle protein gene (HBV S2+S/HBsAgM) under the control of E8 promoter in tomato and tobacco plants. The E8 promoter regulated expression of the antigen in ripened tomato fruit but not in tobacco leaves, flowers and seeds. Their results suggest that E8 promoter might act in a species-specific fashion. Banana fruit has also been used for the expression of HBsAg. Since bananas are propagated through suckers and do not set seeds, this plant is a suitable candidate for gene containment with no segregation of the transgene. Kumar et al. (2005a) expressed HBsAg in banana but reported rather low level of expression at 1 ng/g fresh weight of fruits and up to 38 ng/g fresh weight in leaves. The expression of HBsAg antigen in other plant based systems such as tobacco cell line suspension culture (Sojikul et al., 2003, Kumar et al., 2005b) and potato hairy roots culture (Kumar et al., 2006) have been discussed separately in this review. Major achievements in the expression, characterization and immunogenecity of HBsAg antigen in plant based systems have recently been reviewed by Kumar et al. (2007).",

Dodet (2007) estimated that 55,000 human deaths occur per year from rabies worldwide. Most of these were in case of children. Highest incidence of rabies virus infections was found in developing countries. Effective anti-rabies vaccines are available in the market but they are very expensive. The rabies virus surface glycoprotein (G protein) and nucleoprotein (N protein) antigens have been used for expression in plants to induce immuno-protection. The G protein has been considered as the major antigen responsible for the induction of protective immunity. The N protein is recognized as the main immunomodulator which provides partial protection against rabies virus. McGarvey et al. (1995) expressed G protein coding gene under the control of CaMV35S promoter in tomato. A synthetic gene coding for the G protein of rabies virus was designed and expressed in tobacco leaves in our laboratory (Ashraf et al., 2005). The tobacco leaf-expressed G protein showed glycosylation. When given by intraperitoneal route, it provided immuno-protection against the virus challenge in mice. Arango et al. (2008) recently reported the expression of native N protein under the control of CaMV35S promoter in tomato plants. The expression level was 1\u20135% of total soluble fruit protein. However, only intraperitoneally immunized mice showed weak protection against viral challenge while the orally immunized mice were not protected. Oral delivery of inactivated rabies virus has been reported to give no immunoprotection in mice, apparently due to instability of virus in the gut. The results suggest that all vaccine antigens may not be sufficiently stable, when delivered through oral route. However, experiments involving the development of appropriate formulations for rapid absorption in buccal mucosa may find a solution to such problems.",

Four immunogenic proteins A27L and L1R proteins specific to the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and the A33R and B5R proteins specific to the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) are the best molecular candidates for the development of a smallpox vaccine. The antigen was produced in soluble and insoluble forms upon transient and stable plant transformation. A27L and the A33R protein are stably expressed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the nuclear genome and biolistic transformation of the plastome. The integration of the A27L gene into the chloroplast genome resulted in high-yield accumulation of the recombinant protein (Rigano et al., 2009). Production of the recombinant vaccinia virus B5 antigenic domain (B5) in tobacco leaves was reported by Golovkin et al. (2007). Intranasal administration of soluble B5 led to a rise of B5-specific immunoglobulins. Pogrebnyak et al.

Plants grown under field conditions often shows variable expression of recombinant protein(s). Hence, good manufacturing practices (GMP) and doze standardization may pose difficulties in the use of field grown plants as a source of plant-derived vaccine antigens. Further, linkage between farm and protein handling units may make the operational chain complex and add to costs. On the other hand, plant cell/tissue culture and hairy root culture could provide significant advantage in controlled production of therapeutic proteins. These processes are independent of seasonal variations and enable continuous supply of the product. The continuous secretion and recovery of foreign proteins from cellular and culture medium can minimize the time and cost of process standardization, improve protein recovery, make the process more easily reproducible and reduce protein degradation during handling. The targeting of recombinant proteins with appropriate signal peptides for extracellular secretion can mimic the natural process in plants. Some proteins can be recovered easily from the secretion fluid or culture media. The addition of protein stabilizing agents into the suspension culture medium can increase the accumulation of recombinant protein (Magnuson et al., 1996).",

This enhanced VSP\u03b1S-HBsAg fusion accumulation and stability in tobacco plant cells. The SEKDEL did not show any significant effect on total HBsAg accumulation. Kumar et al.

As plant viruses do not get incorporated into the plant genome, therefore virus vectors only provide transient expression of foreign proteins. The plant viruses have advantage of achieving high level expression of recombinant protein in less time. Moreover, the viral infections are easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation and spread rapidly from plant to plant, making it possible to infect large number of plants in less time.

The self-assembly of such chimeric molecule into virus like particle could result in an immunegen containing the foreign antigenic epitope repeated many times on its surface. They performed experiments in E.coli expression system using tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein gene fused with polio virus. A similar approach of using TMV coat proteins as carriers has been extended to transient expression of foreign genes in intact plants (Dawson et al., 1986). The TMV coat protein gene was among the first plant virus proteins to be used as a carrier molecule for antigenic epitopes (Hamamoto et al., 1993). There are several reviews on the TMV, cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and alfalafa mosaic virus (AIMV) where, plant virus-based transient expression vectors have been discussed to produce recombinant antigens in plants (Pogue et al., 2002, Lacomme et al., 2001, Arntzen, 2005, Liu et al., 2005, Grill et al., 2005). The major limitation of the use of TMV coat protein is that not more than 25 amino acid long peptide can be used in fusion with the TMV coat protein. This is a significant limitation for the production of various molecules of biomedical importance (Koprowski and Yusibov, 2001). However genetically engineered AIMV and CPMV have overcome the limitation of long peptide expression. The CPMV was used for the first time to carry peptides fused to the surface of virus coat protein (Usha et al., 1993). Modelska et al. (1998) and Yusibov et al. (2002) reported genetically engineered AIMV for the expression of two rabies virus epitopes. Mice were immunized intraperitoneally or orally with virus-infected spinach leaves. They detected mucosal immune response after oral induction with a plant-virus-derived vaccinogen. Moreover, the AIMV coat protein can be expressed from a heterologous virus vector such as TMV and particle assembly occurs independently of the carrier virus. Yusibov et al. (1997) reported that mice immunized with recombinant AIMV particles containing either rabies or HIV peptides showed neutralizing antibodies against rabies and HIV, respectively. An attempt has also been made to develop plant-derived contraceptive from a recombinant plant virus (Fitchen et al., 1995). The zona pellucida ZP3 protein of mammalian oocyte has been a target for immune contraception. An epitope of 13 amino acids from murine ZP3 was expressed in plant as a fusion protein with TMV capsid protein. The recombinant virus accumulated high level of the antigenic protein in the infected leaves of tobacco plant. It was observed that mice immunized with the recombinant virus produced antibodies against ZP3. Therefore, foreign antigens expressing on the surface of virus like particles could be isolated from plant tissues, purified partially and then used for immunogenecity experiments. The antigenic epitopes from several human and animal pathogens have been produced in plants using coat proteins from plant viruses as carriers. However, the limitation of this system is that it is applicable only to virus susceptible plant varieties.",

Foreign gene expression occurs during several days after agro infiltration without integration of recombinant DNA into plant genome. This system was first introduced in tobacco but can apply to any leafy species and has been developed commercially in alfalfa by the Canadian Biotechnology Company, Medicago Inc., Quebec, Canada (Yusibov and Rabindran, 2008). A novel system of agro infiltration known as Magnifection (Gleba et al., 2005), which combines the use of plant viruses and Agrobacterium binary plasmids, has been used to express plague antigens in plants (Santi et al., 2006). The use of F1 and V antigens and the derived protein fusion F1-V produced by transient expression in N. benthamiana using a deconstructed tobacco mosaic virus-based system has shown great potential as a protective anti-plague vaccine in animal studies. The plant-derived purified antigens, administered subcutaneously to guinea pigs, generated systemic immune responses and provided protection against an aerosol challenge with virulent Y. pestis (Santi et al., 2006). Using a similar transient system, Mett et al. (2007) expressed the antigens F1 and V as fusions with lichenase. When administered to Cynomolgus Macaques, the purified plant-produced antigens stimulated strong immune responses and provided complete protection against lethal challenge with Y. pestis (Mett et al., 2007). Chichester et al. (2007) described a candidate subunit vaccine against B. anthracis consisting of domain 4 of antigen (PAD4) and domain 1 of LF (LFD1). Each domain was fused to lichenase, a thermostable enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum, and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana Immunization of mice with this candidate vaccine resulted in high titers of lethal toxin neutralizing antibodies. For protection against poxvirus infections, Giulini et al. (2007) produced A27L, A33R, L1R and B5R immunogenic proteins through transient expression in tobacco protoplasts. The extracellular virion membrane protein B5 was transiently expressed using the \u201cmagnifection\u201d procedure. The authors analyzed the impact of purity of plant-based B5 subunit vaccine preparation on specific antibody responses in mice, and demonstrated the efficiency of mucosal administration of plant-derived smallpox vaccine in obtaining a potent immune response (Portocarrero et al., 2008). Tuberculosis (TB) antigen ESAT6 was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves for the creation of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine against TB through PVX based agro infiltration (Zeladaa et al., 2006). Other antigens (Ag85B, ESAT6, and ESAT6:Ag85B fusion) have been expressed using agroinjection method (Dorokhov et al., 2007). The level of Ag85B antigen accumulation was reported at about 800 mg/kg of fresh leaves. Deletion of transmembrane domains from Ag85B caused a dramatic increase in its intracellular stability.",

Transgenic potato tubers carrying a gene for Norwalk virus capsid protein (NVCP) have undergone phase I clinical trials. The human volunteers fed on potato-derived vaccine antigen at Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, USA were found to developed anti-NVCP antibodies in serum (IgG, IgM) and stool (IgA) (Tacket et al., 2000, Tacket, 2005). There were two different reports of clinical trials of HBsAg antigen expressed in potato (Arizona State University, USA and Roswell Park Cancer Institute, USA) and lettuce (Thomas Jefferson University). The phase I clinical trial examined oral delivery of raw potato to volunteers that had previously been primed by injection with a licensed hepatitis B subunit vaccine. The potato HBsAg vaccine antigen was reported to boost anti-HBsAg antibodies in serum (Thanavala et al., 2005). A small scale clinical trial with transgenic lettuce leaves expressing HBsAg antigen has also been conducted (Kapusta et al., 1999). Two of the three volunteers who ingested transgenic lettuce leaves triggered specific serum-IgG response at levels considered to be protective. A rabies vaccine antigen made in spinach by using plant viral vectors is also in phase I trials (Thomas Jefferson University, USA). Antigenic peptides of the anti-rabies glycoprotein and nucleoprotein fused to AIMV coat protein expressed in spinach leaves were given to two groups of human volunteers (Yusibov et al., 2002). One group consisted individuals who had previously been vaccinated with licensed rabies vaccine and the second composed of rabies-na\u00efve individuals. The significant elevations of rabies-specific serum IgG levels were observed in three of five previously immunized volunteers. In the na\u00efve individuals belong to non-vaccinated group, low but significant elevations in rabies-specific serum IgG levels were seen in five of the nine volunteers. Increased serum rabies-specific IgA antibodies were also detected in three of the five individuals. The HBsAg expressed in transgenic potato at Arizona State University, USA and the Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma antigen expressed in tobacco at Large Scale Biotechnology, USA have been submitted for phase II clinical trials (Basaran and Rodriguez-Cerezo, 2008).",

            "text": "With the world's population at over 6.4 billion (http://esa.un.org), majority of the poor need affordable technological solutions to health. Protection from viral infections is currently the most difficult area to address through drug development. Progress in plant genetic engineering has opened novel opportunities to use plants as bioreactors for safe and cost effective production of vaccine antigens. As is clear from several examples cited in this review, the production of recombinant proteins in plant systems has a great potential. Recent developments in this area have significantly increased its utility and enabled various groups to explore the possibility of producing vaccine antigens from a variety of plants, which can be directly or indirectly used to develop commercial processes. Transgenic plants that can produce biologically active proteins or subunit oral vaccines and antibodies have been developed, though the applications of these technologies are at least a decade away. There are several technical and logistic problems which need to be addressed before plant-derived edible vaccine becomes a reality. Some of these are as follows.(a)Most inserted genes are expressed at very low level in plants. The development of efficient promoters that target the expression of therapeutic proteins in plant tissues is required. The selection of suitable plant tissue specific promoters, signal sequences, ER retention sequences, plant preferred codon usage, protein stabilization, post translational modification etc. will lead to increasing the accumulation of transproteins in plant tissues.(b)Transgenic fruits or leaves stored under ambient conditions may require immediate extraction and purification of the antigens. On the other hand, the expression in seeds allows storage at room temperature for a year and longer. Thus, seed based approaches need to be emphasized to rid of the dependence on cold chain.(c)Enhancing the stability of vaccine antigens expressed in plants can give a distinct advantage in utility of such plant based approaches. However, stable expression of the recombinant proteins needs to be tightly regulated to avoid passage of transgene into unwanted plants or consumer food stocks. Besides physical containment of transgenic crops, the chloroplast based genetic transformation and the use of vegetatively propagated varieties or triploid hybrids provide simpler natural containment strategies for grain and fruit-producing crops. Recently Liu et al. (2008) developed a novel chimeric fPSC promoter for complete containment of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow. This has application in transgene containment of non-fruit and non-grain crops.(d)Development of tolerance to the antigen consumed orally as a result of suppression of systemic immunity is an area of concern. There is need to identify useful adjuvants that could enhance oral immunogenicity and develop formulations to improve stability and rapid absorption through mucosal tissue.(e)Standardization of dosage in case of edible vaccine is a major problem as plant to plant and generation to generation expression of the vaccine antigen may vary. The expression also depends on where and when the plants are grown. Therefore, a delivery scheme needs to be developed to ensure the delivery of required dosage level. Collaborative research between plant and medical scientists may help in resolving these and related issues. The plant-based edible vaccine technology might first be targeted to wild life and animals to gain experience. In fact, such an approach may benefit agriculture as billions of dollars are spent presently on vaccinating farm animals and poultry.(f)Much effort needs to be devoted towards examining issues related to commercialization of the concept of edible vaccines. Strategies to increase yield potential of the concerned protein, glycosylation pattern in comparison to the mammalian protein, pharmacological efficacy and formulation development deserve high priority.(g)The development of stable transgenic plants may also be avoidable by adopting transient expression, plant cell culture and hairy root culture systems. The root exudates are devoid of pigments and tannins. The endoplasmic reticulum signal may be used for secretion of the biologically active proteins in medium. Such preparations are free of pathogenic contamination and can be used through oral route. These strategies are more conveniently amenable to GLP and GMP protocols.(h)Issues relating to the ethical, social, biosafety and environmental impact which directly/indirectly effect the deployment of genetically modified crops (de Melo-Martin and Meghani, 2008) are a concern. However, these will be met in course of time, through enhancing the awareness of merits and the development of regulatory and standard operating procedures.\n",

The present opportunity to develop vaccine antigens using plants as expression systems represents an example wherein, in spite of a major societal need, the progress in the development of edible or oral vaccines has been rather slow. This is because of inadequate networking among plant scientists, immunologists and experts in vaccine research. It requires more innovative thinking for the approach to work and needs larger investments.
