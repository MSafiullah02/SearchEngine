            "text": "Pneumonia is a common illness with estimates of approximately 450 million cases per year. According to the World Health Organization, lower respiratory tract infections account for approximately 7% of deaths per year worldwide.1 Viruses are a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, particularly among children. Among pediatric community-acquired pneumonia studies, where viral causes were specifically sought, the incidence of viral etiology of infection was 49%. The most common viruses isolated were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (11%), influenza virus (10%), parainfluenza virus (8%), and adenovirus (3%).2 A Canadian study found that among adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia with an identifiable pathogen, 15% were viral and 20% bacterial, with 4% being mixed. The most common viral pathogens were influenza, human metapneumovirus, and RSV. Patients with viral infections were older, more likely to have cardiac disease, and in general more frail compared with adults with bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore, all cases of viral pneumonia occurred between October and May, whereas bacterial pathogens had no seasonal predilection. In this study, there were no differences in outcomes between viral or bacterial causes of pneumonia.3 In a retrospective cohort analysis of adults admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with either severe community-acquired or health care\u2013associated pneumonia, 115 of 198 patients had bronchoalveolar lavage and 159 of 198 had nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of those with samples, 36.4% had a viral pathogen isolated and 35.9% had a bacterial pathogen isolated. Viral pathogens isolated in order of highest to lowest frequency were rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, and RSV. Again in this study, mortality was not different between bacterial and viral causes of pneumonia.4\n",

In most cases, influenza infections are self-limited, mild illnesses lasting 4 to 5 days with predominantly upper airway symptoms. Among the most common severe complications and causes of death from influenza are viral pneumonia and/or secondary bacterial pneumonia.5 In the absence of a pandemic, 11% to 19% of patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza require treatment in the ICU.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Complications and death from influenza occur most commonly among the elderly, the very young, and those with chronic medical conditions. Chronic lung disease is the most common comorbidity associated with influenza infection, followed by neurologic disease, hemato-oncologic disease, and cardiac disease.6 Risk factors for severe influenza complications are summarized in Table 1\n. A younger age of patients with critical illness is seen during pandemics, including the 2009 H1N1. In the historic 1918 pandemic, there was unexplained excess mortality in persons aged 20 to 40 years, with most deaths attributable to secondary bronchopneumonia, influenza-related lung disease, and associated cyanosis and cardiac collapse.11 In the 1918 epidemic it was estimated that one-third of the world\u2019s population were infected with influenza, and the case-fatality rate was exceptionally high at greater than 2.5% in comparison with other pandemics. The number of deaths has been estimated to be at least 50 million.12\n",

A classic prodromal illness of high fever, chills, sore throat, aches, and dry nonproductive cough preceded the development of respiratory distress. Physical examination showed evidence of fever, respiratory distress, diffuse inspiratory crackles bilaterally, and occasional wheezes. Chest radiography (CXR) showed bilateral infiltrates similar to those in congestive heart failure (CHF) but without other clinical signs of volume overload. Although values of partial pressure of oxygen (Pao\n2) are not provided, the low oxygen saturations on high-level oxygen, radiographic characteristics, and lack of CHF would fit the description of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to viral pneumonia, as seen with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

The mean number of admissions for viral pneumonitis within the same period in the prior 4 years was 57.33\n",

However, the majority did not have the kinds of major chronic organ failure typical of patients admitted to medical ICUs. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of ICU patients was 20, with major comorbidities present in 30%.21 Similar patient demographics were noted in other countries, and many are known risk factors for influenza infection.33, 38, 39 Indigenous persons from Australia and New Zealand, as well as Aboriginal Canadians (26%), were overrepresented among those who were critical ill.21, 33, 40 Obesity, which interestingly has not been previously linked to complications of influenza, was a prominent risk factor for severe respiratory disease secondary to 2009 H1N1.21, 26, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41, 42 Pregnancy is well described as a risk factor for complications from seasonal influenza; however, the number of critically ill pregnant women with 2009 H1N1 pneumonitis was disproportionately large and led to excess mortality in this group.42, 43, 44, 45 In Australia and New Zealand, pregnant women had a relative risk of 13.2 of requiring ICU admission for their illness in comparison with nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Sixty-nine percent of women required mechanical ventilation and 11% died, all with viral pneumonitis and ARDS.44 In California, 22% of pregnant women infected by 2009 H1N1 required ICU admission and 8% died, leading to an influenza-specific maternal mortality rate of 4.3 per 100,000 live births.46\n",

Those who died or had ARDS had delayed clearance of viral load in their nasopharynx, had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and higher likelihood of viremia. There was significant correlation between the levels of interleukin (IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15) and disease severity. The association between high IL-6 and severe disease from influenza has been previously established.64 Initial nasopharyngeal or endotracheal viral loads were similar among patients with differing disease severity; therefore, it would not appear to be viral load at the onset of infection that determines disease severity.63\n",

Immunohistochemistry showed viral antigens in airway epithelial cells, submucosal glands, and pneumocytes.66 Viral antigen was also commonly seen in alveolar macrophages.67 These studies show that H1N1 2009 virus has the ability to target both lower and upper respiratory tract infections, thus leading to DAD and clinical ARDS.

Ideally, therapy should be started within 48 hours of symptom onset, but is also effective and recommended if given later than this.70 The recommended dose is 75 mg twice a day, although higher doses were given at some centers for critically ill and obese patients according to WHO recommendations.71 Recent data suggest that 75 mg of oseltamivir administered twice per day via the orogastric route in critically ill patients consistently yields sufficient blood levels for near maximal (in vitro) suppression of viral replication.72 Most patients also received broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, at least initially, while investigations were pending to determine the cause of respiratory failure. Current recommendations from the CDC state that antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible in any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who requires hospitalization, has severe, complicated, and progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza complications (ie, <2 years and >65 years, immunocompromised, chronic disease, pregnant or postpartum, morbidly obese, Aboriginal, and residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities). The current recommended therapy is either oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir. However, in individuals with underlying respiratory disease, oseltamivir is recommended over zanamivir.73 In critically ill patients with pneumonia, the viral RNA may be detected in lower airway secretions for several weeks after the initiation of oseltamivir. In patients with influenza pneumonia or evidence of clinical progression, an increased dose of the oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily in adults) and, more importantly, an increased duration of therapy for 10 days instead of 5 days, may be warranted.29, 74 Oseltamivir-resistant viruses have been isolated, but are not common. The resistance is via a His275Tyr mutation in viral neuraminidase, which confers high-level resistance to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. Most resistant isolates have been found in patients with prior oseltamivir exposure, and have been associated with mild self-limited disease. If oseltamivir resistance is suspected or confirmed, treatment should be with zanamivir.29, 75\n",

However, there were only 13 patients and there was no real comparator group, as all patients received some degree of steroid therapy.85 A study from the European Society of Intensive Care medicine H1N1 registry found that early use of corticosteroids in patients admitted to the ICU with H1N1 was associated with increased risk of superinfections, predominantly hospital-acquired pneumonia, with no mortality benefit.86 Similarly, other studies found no mortality benefit or even harm with early steroid use.87, 88 At present there is insufficient evidence for routine use of steroids in 2009 H1N1 or other influenza-related ARDS. Some historical data and experience with recent influenza epidemics suggests the potential utility of convalescent serum in the management of severe influenza.89, 90 Although research on the issue is clearly required, the use of convalescent serum or immunoglobulin may become a useful treatment modality should future pandemic influenza A viruses be resistant to current antiviral agents.",

Viral pneumonias tend to have a seasonal predilection and are often preceded by a prodromal illness. Disease surveillance systems are important in detecting outbreaks and particularly the emergence of novel viral pathogens capable of human transmission. Several common viral pathogens can lead to severe respiratory disease, including the most common virus, influenza A. Unfortunately, appropriate diagnostic testing is often not pursued or is unavailable, particularly in smaller community hospitals. Treatment of viral pneumonia is generally supportive; however, diagnostic testing to isolate the causative virus is important because some pathogens, such as influenza virus, have effective antiviral therapies. Specifically in the case of 2009 H1N1, early treatment with antiviral therapy appeared to be associated with improved outcomes.",
