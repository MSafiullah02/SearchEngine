This is especially true when the health information itself is not timely, trusted, consistent, or actionable. Health literacy has emerged over the past 3 decades as one of the strongest psychosocial determinants of health, and it has also been shown to explain a range of health disparities by age, race/ ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (6) . Thus, in uncertain times like this, when the interpretation of critical and ever-changing public health messages is paramount, many vulnerable populations may be further marginalized by inadequate health communication, posing substantial risks to themselves and their communities.",

These studies were selected because they enroll mostly middle-aged or older adults (range, 23 to 88 years) with 1 or more chronic conditions who therefore would be at greater risk for COVID-19. The studies use common assessments, allowing for uniform measurement of many patient characteristics. The Northwestern University Institutional Review Board approved study procedures, and all patients included in this telephone survey had provided prior consent to be contacted for future research opportunities. Data were collected from 13 through 20 March 2020.",

In brief, recruitment procedures included identifying potentially eligible participants via electronic health record queries; sending them a letter describing the study; then telephoning any patients who did not opt out of being contacted to introduce the study, screen for eligibility, and schedule an in-person baseline interview. Common exclusion criteria for all studies include the presence of a severe and uncorrectable cognitive, visual, or hearing impairment that would preclude a participant's ability to complete interviews. For this survey, we targeted participants whose last interview was done between 2018 and the present.

Perceived concern for COVID-19 (more plainly called \"coronavirus\") was evaluated by first asking participants to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being no threat at all and 10 being very serious), how serious a public health threat they believed the coronavirus is or might become. In addition, a single question asked participants to rate their level of worry about getting the coronavirus (very worried, somewhat worried, a little worried, or not worried at all). To provide context, this same question was asked with regard to influenza, and participants were also asked whether they had received an influenza vaccine in the past year.",

When our C3 survey started on 13 March 2020, there were only 46 cases and no deaths; by the end of the survey on 20 March, there were 585 cases and 5 deaths. Across the United States and worldwide, the outbreak was increasing at a rate of 40% to 50% more new cases daily during the week of the interviews. At the same time, several measures were announced in succession: Schools began closing across Illinois, employers were sending staff home to work remotely, various public restrictions were implemented (bar and restaurant closures and limitations on gatherings), and ultimately a \"shelter at home\" order was announced. Thus, our findings provide a rare snapshot of how a cohort of mostly middle-aged and older adults with underlying health conditions adapted to this unprecedented time and took action, or not. Our study identified concerning demographic and socioeconomic differences in how individuals perceived the threat of COVID-19 and, perhaps, their own ability to take actions to prevent illness. Specifically, those who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were less likely to believe that they might become infected, and black respondents were less worried about the pandemic. Black adults also felt less prepared for an outbreak than white adults, and individuals with low health literacy reported not only being less prepared but also having more confidence in the federal government response.",

In our study, disparities by race, socioeconomic status, and health literacy were not reflected in ratings of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat, demonstrated knowledge of its symptom presentation or general means to prevent it, or reported changes to daily routines and plans. Prior research has documented racial differences pertaining to trust in the health care system (15) (16) (17) . For those who are living below the poverty level or have low health literacy, perceptions of personal risk and the ability to prevent infection may be limited. This may be due to feeling less able to change one's social circumstance, or lack of public health communications that are explicit and actionable and provide clear, efficacious messaging pertaining to recommended protective behaviors (18, 19) . A previous report found socioeconomic and literacy disparities in mortality associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic; likewise, our findings should raise caution (20) .

First, this survey was done among a selected group of patients who were all active participants in cohort studies or clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health in 1 large U.S. city. Thus, these findings may have limited generalizability, especially for younger adults and those without underlying health conditions. However, our study samples purposefully include men and women who are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse and are at greatest risk for COVID-19 because of age and underlying conditions. Second, to rapidly implement our investigation and quickly recruit as large a sample as possible during the first of multiple waves of interviews, we were limited in the depth of our survey and number of items to use. Prior research on virus outbreaks guided our selection and creation of survey items (12), but we lacked the time or opportunity to validate all questions, particularly in the midst of a public health crisis. However, items followed best practices for the design of assessments for use among persons with lower literacy (21) . Third, our outcomes capture only initial awareness of COVID-19, degree of worry, fundamental knowledge, attitudes, and a limited set of behaviors. Understanding of the virus has since evolved, and we could not expand on those developments. Items included in planned follow-up waves of ORIGINAL RESEARCH Awareness, Attitudes, and Actions Related to COVID-19 the survey will adapt accordingly and expand data capture on behaviors, among other just-in-time topics.",

It is likely that all of what we report in this 1-week glimpse has considerably altered. Regardless, our findings depict the initial lack of clarity in understanding, perceived susceptibility, and personal efficacy regarding the pandemic among those at greatest risk.

The potential for the COVID-19 pandemic to exacerbate health disparitiespotentially through mechanisms related to inadequate or conflicting public health messaging among those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, belong to racial minority groups, or have more limited health literacy-may be exceptionally high. Actions are needed now to ensure that as the pandemic unfolds, all citizens are adequately made aware of the gravity of the threat; with great clarity and attention to health literacy best practices, we need to explain specific steps that must be taken to avoid harm.
