Whereas COVID-19 commonly presents as a flu-like illness with fever and persistent cough as its main symptoms, there is evidence of milder disease, especially in younger people. According to the WHO some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some suffer profound sudden and complete loss of smell and taste (1) . About 80% of COVID-19 sufferers experience a mild case -of similar severity to a common cold -and recover without needing any special treatment (2) . This clinical presentation might be confused with seasonal allergic rhinitis, especially in those new to such symptoms. Figure 1 shows the overlap and the major differentiating features. Cough and fever are the most prominent symptoms of COVID-19, whereas conjunctivitis and itching point to allergic rhinitis as the diagnosis.",

SAR patients are strongly recommended to keep social distancing, to wear a mask to avoid aerosol formation when sneezing or speaking, to carry spare masks and tissues and bin them safely after use. It would be sensible, where possible, for SAR patients to be tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, since they could be potent viral spreaders.",

Also, treatment with biologicals for patients with more severe asthma and severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps should be continued to avoid aggravation of these diseases as per guidelines (9).Although the CDC advises that \"People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.
