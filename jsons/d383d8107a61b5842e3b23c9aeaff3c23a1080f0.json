The relative lengths of the index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers (digit ratio; 2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic (males < females) proxy of fetal sex steroids (low 2D:4D indicates high prenatal testosterone / low prenatal estrogen). Aim: To examine sex-specific relationships of 2D:4D per nation with national values of COVID-19 CFRs. Study design: COVID-19 CFRs and the percent of male deaths were related to mean national (self-reported) 2D:4D by sex and hand from a large online survey (the BBC Internet Study). Subjects: 103482 men and 83366 women. Outcome measures: Relationships of mean national 2D:4D with CFRs from 41 countries and with national male death rates from 16 countries. Results: Male right and left hand 2D:4D showed positive relationships with CFR. These relationships remained significant after removing the influence of female 2D:4D. A positive association of male right and left 2D:4D was detected with the percentage of male deaths. Conclusions: At the national level, high mean 2D:4D (indicating low prenatal testosterone / high prenatal Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Digit Ratio and Covid-19 2",

Males tend to generate less robust immune responses than females and are more susceptible to a variety of infectious agents including RNA viruses [4] [5] [6] .

Infectivity of COVID-19 depends on priming of the spike proteins by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [13] , and TMPRSS2 may cleave angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for augmented viral entry [14] . Importantly, androgen receptor activity is a requirement for the transcription of the TMPRSS2 gene, suggesting that testosterone facilitates SARS-CoV2 cell entry [15, 16] . The androgendriven COVID-19 pandemic theory concerns circulating levels of testosterone and has some support from the relationship between age-related COVID-19 mortality rates. For example, it may explain why children are more resistant to infections before adrenarche and puberty [15, 16] . Thus, high mortality from SARS-CoV2 in men should be related to hypergonadism and to low (masculinized) 2D:4D.",

This seems reasonable given the substantial excess in male mortality associated with the disease [22] . However, there is support for the counter-theory that treatment of COVID-19 should involve an increase the amount of ACE2 in the lungs [23] . ACE2 protects from lung injury, but ACE2 is also the critical SARS-CoV receptor. The severity of COVID-19 could be explained by SARS-CoV spike protein binding to ACE2, which leads to endocytosis of the virus but the loss of ACE2 from the surface of the cell. This establishes a circle of viral infection and local loss of lung protection. In support of this model, Monteil et al. [24] showed that soluble human ACE2 molecule could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections and reduce viral load by a factor of 1,000-5,000.",

The ACE2 gene is more strongly expressed in females compared to males, in young males compared to old males and in healthy men compared to those with several co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes [23] . These associations suggest a negative correlation between ACE2 expression and CovID19 fatality at both population and molecular levels, which will be instrumental when designing potential prevention and treatment strategies for ACE2 binding coronaviruses in general [23] .

This may be evidence that COVID-19 damages testicular function, however the same results would be obtained if the patients had compromised gonadal function before infection [28] .

A diagram of the hand illustrated the measurements, taken from on the ventral side of the digit with a conventional ruler and reported to the nearest millimeter.

Mean and standard deviation (M \u00b1 SD) of CFR was 3.89 \u00b1 3.51 and the distribution showed a rightward skew (skew = 1.371, kurtosis = 1.043; Shapiro-Wilks W = .833, p < .0001). We log-transformed CFR (log CFR), which resulted in a mean of 0.400 (.457) (skew = -.724, kurtosis = .898, Shapiro-Wilks W = .959, p = .151). The percent of male deaths per nation was available from 16 countries (M = 60.94 \u00b1 5.46 percent). significant sex differences in right and left hand 2D:4D, with males < females (males: right hand M = .983 \u00b1 .003, left hand M = .940 \u00b1 .003; females: right hand M = .993 \u00b1 .004, left hand M = .992 \u00b1 .005; right hand t = 14.88, p < .0001, left hand t = 11.22, p < .0001 (Tables 2 and 3). Male (but not female) 2D:4D correlated positively with log CFR (males: right hand r = .34, p < .05 [Figure 1], left hand r = .29, p = .07; females: right hand r = .03, p = .83, left hand r = .03, p = .83. Male 2D:4D correlated positively with female 2D:4D (right hand r = .37, p < .05; left hand r = .49, p < .001. We performing multiple regressions with the dependent variable log CFR and the independent variables male and female right 2D:4D or male and female left 2D:4D. Male right hand 2D:4D remained positively related to log CFR and female 2D:4D showed no relationship (males: right hand 2D:4D B = 51.84, SE B = 22.25, beta = .38, p < .05; females: right 2D:4D B = -11.26, SE B = 17.32, beta = -.11, p = .52). Male left hand 2D:4D also remained positively related to log CFR and female 2D:4D showed no relationship (males: left 2D:4D B = 48.53, SE B = 23.81, beta = .36, p < .05; females: left: 2D:4D B = -13.63, SE B = 17.09, beta = -.14, p = .43). The sample size for examining 2D:4D relationships with percent of male deaths (n = 16) was small. Nevertheless, there were positive correlations for males with both right (r = .63, p < .01, Figure 2) and left 2D:4D (r = .52, p < .05), and a weak association for female right hands (r = .50, p = .049) but no correlation for female left hands (r = .41, p = .12). Multiple regression analysis showed male right hand 2D:4D (B = 1513.03, SE B = 705.07, beta = .51, p = .050) remained significantly related to percent of male deaths independent of female right 2D:4D (B = 495.91, SE B = 459.45, beta = .26, p = .30). For male left hand 2D:4D there was a marginally significant relationship with percent of male SE B = 527.77, beta = .47, p = .053) and no relationship for female left hand 2D:4D (B = 579.00, SE B = 375.07, beta = .34, p = .15). Discussion We detected a positive association between mean male right hand 2D:4D per nation and log CFR (n = 41 nations), and a positive (but non-significant) association for mean male left hand 2D:4D. There were no correlations between mean female 2D:4D per nation and log CFRs. Male and female 2D:4Ds correlated positively. Male right and left hand 2D:4D correlated positively with log CFR when the influence of female 2D:4D was removed. Similar patterns of positive relationships pertained between male mean 2D:4D and percent of male deaths per nation. Here the sample size was lower (n = 16 nations),but the focus on male deaths rather than overall mortality would be expected to increase the effect size. This is what we found as the effect size for the correlation between nations increased from an r 2 value of about 10% to >30%.Our findings support a link between high 2D:4D (low prenatal testosterone) and high severity of COVID-19 in men. However, we are considering comparative data across nations and this introduces some limitations to our analysis. Testing regimes vary across nations with some testing widely in the population and others focusing mainly on hospital admissions for COVID-19. This affects comparative values of CFRs. Therefore, we strongly advise that future investigations of associations of 2D:4D and COVID-19 severity consider patients. If there is a strong positive correlation with disease severity in men, the measurement of 2D:4D (particularly right hand 2D:4D) may be of prognostic use for the severity of COVID-19.",
