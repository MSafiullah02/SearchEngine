As this is written (March 27, 2020), the nation is still on the very steep upslope of the curve of the number of patients diagnosed with the disease. Many sources predict that the apex of that curve will not be reached until June 2020. Surgical services have been severely disrupted and will be for at least several months. The pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to surgical residency and fellowship programs. In turn, there are unprecedented challenges to the process of accrediting those programs. This article delineates some of those challenges and the responses to them that are known, to date.",

This is certainly true in Seattle, New York City, and other cities in the vanguard of the pandemic, but it is also true in cities that have, so far, a relatively low incidence of the disease. Elective cases normally done by residents/fellows have been postponed or cancelled. 1 Clinic and office visits have been severely curtailed or eliminated. Surgical fellows are being, or will be, deployed as attending physicians in their core specialties. Residents and fellows have been, or will be, placed on rotating shifts, both consistent with current clinical demands for surgical services and to minimize their exposure to the virus. Residents and fellows have been, or will be, deployed as primary care doctors in screening facilities, emergency rooms, and medical wards, or to supplement the physician force in medical critical care units. Because of both clinical demands and the need for \"social distancing,\" clinical and educational conferences are being held remotely, if at all. It is, or soon will be, impossible in many instances for programs to evaluate residents/fellows in anything approaching the normal curriculum of the specialty/subspecialty. Residents, fellows, and attending surgeons are being, and will be, sidelined by quarantine due to exposure to the virus or recovering from SARS COV2 infections themselves. Although to date, none have been reported, there will predictably be deaths of surgical residents, fellows, and attendings as a result of SARS COV2 infections acquired in performing their clinical duties.",

The impact of those deficient experiences will be greatest on residents/fellows in their ultimate or penultimate years of training (as previously scheduled). And the degree of impact will be inversely correlated to the length of the training program. A few months of curtailed clinical activity for residents in a 7-year neurological surgery program might be relatively easily overcome. The period of March through June, though, constitutes onethird of a colon and rectal surgery program and all of the 1-year surgical fellowship programs.",

All accredited programs are required to participate in these surveys each academic year. The surveys are administered to programs in different specialties/subspecialties in 3 roughly 5-week \"windows,\" from January through April. The required completion rate of the surveys for each program is 70%. In the next accreditation system, 2 programs may be site-visited as infrequently as every 10 years. The Review Committees are, therefore, heavily dependent upon the surveys as a source of information for what is happening at the program level. The \"window\" closed in February for the surveys in colon and rectal surgery, otolaryngology, obstetrics and gynecology, plastic surgery, and the subspecialties of each. Therefore, surveys in those programs were completed when the virus had been detected in very few cities. The \"window\" for surveys in orthopaedic surgery, surgery, thoracic surgery, urology, and all of their subspecialties closed on March 15, just as the pandemic began to grip a few metropolitan areas. The \"window\" scheduled for neurological surgery, ophthalmology, and their subspecialties was to be March 9 to April 12, clearly at a time when the pandemic began to broadly reshape the activities of surgical trainees and programs. ACGME announced March 18 that surveys would remain available for those who wished to complete them until May 15, 2020, 3 but that the normal periodic ACGME reminders to programs to complete the surveys would be suspended. The surveys have historically been analyzed in the context of all responders, nationally, regardless of specialty. As the national response pool to the 2020 surveys will predictably be quite truncated, it remains to be seen what survey data will be made available to review committees for use in their 2021 accreditation decisions.",

A site visit must occur with the application for a new program, and a site visit must also occur at the end of the 2-year period of initial accreditation for a new program.

The ACGME did not want to further disrupt already stressed clinical environments. The ACGME did not want its site visitors to become vectors of disease by traveling on airplanes to and from clinical environments that may be dealing with infected patients. Finally, it was important to the ACGME to protect the health of the site visitors, themselves. The necessary site visits will be scheduled once again when the clinical activity of the sponsoring institutions returns to more normal activity and when it is again safe for the site visitors to travel. Accreditation decisions for the year 2020 will be delayed for a very small minority of programs until site visits can be accomplished and Review Committee decisions can be made based on those site visits.",

Certainly, no one yet knows how severely ACGME-accredited surgical programs will be affected or for how long. The surgical Review Committees are acutely aware that the coming months will not be \"business as usual\" for accredited programs. In most, if not all, accredited surgical programs, residents/fellows will not have access to elective surgical cases for several months to come. In most, if not all, accredited surgical programs, residents/fellows will see and evaluate a drastically smaller than normal number of patients in clinics and offices for at least the next several months. In many accredited programs, residents/fellows have been, or will be, at times taken out of surgical settings, altogether, due to re-deployment in emergency rooms, screening centers, medical wards, medical critical care units, etc. Even residents/fellows who are assigned to surgical services are likely to be working on a rotating schedule of days on and off, both because of decreased clinical surgical demands and as a means of mitigating their exposure to the virus. Educational and clinical conferences have already been disrupted by the need for social distancing, if not by clinical demands. Programs can and should continue to hold conferences remotely whenever possible. However, the quality and penetrance of those conferences will likely suffer because few (if any) programs have previously made remote conferencing their routine, so will have many obstacles to overcome. Evaluation and feedback are critical for the continued professional growth of residents/fellows, but will be greatly impaired by clinical demands, disrupted schedules, resident/fellow redeployments, and other issues. In the same vein, program evaluation is critical for improvement but will suffer from the same obstacles as trainee evaluation. It is also clear that residents/fellows and attending surgeons will be sidelined for significant periods of time due to known exposure to the virus or becoming infected themselves. Sadly, some surgical residents, fellows, and attendings will predictably succumb to the virus.",

It is even possible that some programs will be unable, in the fall months, to complete their ACGME annual program updates, which are another critical tool in the accreditation process. The case log minima will remain in place for every surgical specialty and subspecialty for which they have been developed but will, necessarily, be interpreted and applied in the context of the impact of the pandemic on the 2020 graduate case logs. For all these reasons, the Review Committees will have far less information on which to base accreditation decisions in 2021 than they have had in any other year since their establishment. Three domains of program requirements will remain in effect for every program throughout the pandemic: requirements limiting resident/fellow work hours, the requirements for appropriate supervision, and the requirements for resident/fellow safety, including provision of training and equipment appropriate to the clinical circumstance. To the extent that it can be assessed, compliance with those requirements will likely comprise a major consideration of a Review Committee regarding the accreditation status of a program.",
