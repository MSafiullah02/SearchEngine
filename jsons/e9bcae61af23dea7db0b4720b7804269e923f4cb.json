A significant portion of this useful information is stored in PDF files -research articles, books, company reports, and presentations are typically disseminated in PDF format. PDF documents need to be converted into plain text before being processed by an Information Retrieval (IR) or a text mining system. These files can either be digitally created or created from scanned documents. While the former are generated from an original electronic version of a document (i.e., contain the text characters), the later contain images of the original document and need to go through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) so that their contents can be extracted. Despite being addressed by researchers for decades, OCR is still imperfect. As a result, the extracted text contains errors that typically involve character exchanges. Although digitally created PDFs are cleaner, they are not problem-free since, for example, hyphenated terms (due to separation into syllables) may be identified as two tokens and indexed incorrectly.",

Approaches for treating misspelled queries cannot solve this problem as the issue is in the document, not in the query.

Ideally, to quantify the impact, one needs an IR test collection with source PDF files, their extracted and corrected versions, a set of queries, and their corresponding relevance judgments. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, such a collection does not exist and creating one would demand significant effort. In line with previous works on this topic [3, 7] , our approach was to systematically insert errors in a standard IR collection containing plain text documents, queries, and relevance judgments. Different error rates were tested so that we could gauge their effects. In order to simulate real errors, we collected, assessed, and manually corrected a sample of OCR-ed PDF documents. Statistics drawn from this sample were used to guide the error insertion approach. Our experiments were performed in an IR collection containing documents in Portuguese -a language that makes use of diacritics (e.g.,\u00e0,\u00e1,\u00e3,\u00e2,\u00e9,\u00ed,\u00e7 etc.). These characters are typically among the ones with more extraction errors. The results showed that error rates starting at 5% can cause a significant impact in many system configurations and that stemming makes systems more robust to coping with errors. ",

            "text": "Existing work on dealing with OCR-ed texts spans over a long period and focused on approaches for detecting and fixing errors [4, 5, 9, 10] . Specifically on the topic of improving the retrieval of OCR text, Beitzel et al. [1] surveyed a number of solutions -most of which date to the late 1990s. TREC ran a confusion track to assess retrieval effectiveness on degraded collections. Their modified test collections had 5 and 20% character error rates. Five teams took part in the challenge. The organizers reported that counter-intuitive results had been found and that \"there is still a great deal to be understood about the interaction of the diverse approaches\" [7] . Croft et al. [3] share some similarities with our work. However, rather than injecting errors into a clean text collection, the authors opted to randomly select words to be discarded from the document and, as a consequence, they were not indexed. The limitation of such approach is that it does not account for issues with wrong segmentation (adding or suppressing the space character) or cases in which the error modifies the word into another valid word. The main finding was that performance degradation was more critical for very short documents. In a detailed investigation, Taghva et al. [13] observed that while the results seem to have insignificant degradation on average, individual queries can be greatly impacted. Furthermore, they report an impressive increase in the number of index terms in the presence of errors and that relevance feedback methods are unable to overcome OCR errors. This paper differs from existing works in a number of aspects. The configurations we assess include the use of stemming, more recent ranking algorithms, and more levels of degradation. Finally, we experiment with a different test collection in a language that has not been extensively used for IR.",

Our goal is to replicate, as much as possible, the pattern of problems that actually happen in PDF conversions to plain text from both digitally created and scanned documents. In order to achieve that, one needs a sample of aligned pairs of extracted and expected contents (shown as input in Fig. 2 ). The expected contents need to be manually produced by correcting the extracted text. This is a laborious and time-consuming task. By comparing these <extracted, expected> pairs at character level, we generate a character exchange list. To align the <extracted, expected> pairs, we used the Needleman-Wunsch [8] algorithm. This algorithm generates the best (global) alignment of two sequences, with the addition of gaps to account for mismatching characters. We found exchanges of one-to-one (e.g., \"inserted\" \u2192 \"insorted\"), one-to-two (e.g., \"document\" \u2192 \"docurnent\"), or two-to-one (e.g., \"light\" \u2192 \"hght\") characters. The frequencies of the exchanges were computed and stored in the character exchange list. Then, they are used to bias the error insertion algorithm towards the most frequent exchanges.",

Experimental Procedure. In our experimental procedure, we varied the following parameters. The Ranking function, taking three possibilities: Cosine (COS) using TF-IDF weighting, BM25, and Divergence from Randomness (DFR). The use of stemming: applying a light stemmer (ST) and no stemming (NS). The error rates were 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50%. Baseline runs using the original documents were also created. The candidate terms for error insertion were either any term from any document (ALL) or any term from the judged documents (JD). These variations amounted to a total of 72 experimental runs, which were evaluated using standard IR metrics. Statistical significance was measured using T-tests. Queries were made by simply taking the title field from the topics. The goal was to simulate real queries that are typically short. Table 1 shows the number of index terms for the combination of error rates, use of stemming, and candidate terms. As expected, the number of index entries grows remarkably with the error rates, reaching more than a four-fold increase for unstemmed runs with a 50% error rate.",

Strangely, in two runs in which the cosine was used, the insertion of errors at a 1% rate improved the performance (ALL-COS-NS and JD-COS-ST). This can be explained by the fact that errors are inserted both relevant and non-relevant documents. In these cases, the errors were introduced in non-relevant documents which made relevant documents be ranked higher. The use of stemming consistently improved the results -i.e., all runs in which stemming was used had higher scores than their unstemmed counterparts. Stemming has made the runs more robust to the OCR errors. This can be seen comparing the loss in MAP of the runs with and without stemming. Nearly all runs in which stemming was used had smaller losses than their counterparts. Furthermore, the aid of stemming is more noticeable in the runs with higher error rates. The benefit of stemming can be explained by the fact that the OCR error can be in the suffix that is removed. Looking at the correlation between the number of index terms (Table 2 ) and MAP, we find a strong negative correlation of 0.86. When the correlation is measured for stemmed and unstemmed runs separately, the negative correlations are 0.81 and 0.90, respectively. This gives further support to the benefits of stemming.",

At a 10% rate, all runs are significantly affected. Recall that this small error rate was found using the software which provided the best results on relatively recent documents. Some studies that provide statistics of the proportion of errors found in OCR-ed documents report finding error rates of around 20% in historical documents [4, 5, 14] . At that error rate, the degradation is considered statistically significant.",
