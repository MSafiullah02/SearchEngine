Materials and methods The health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals in China mainland during the COVID-19 epidemic was inquired. The status of non-emergency dental services, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation and the hospitals' geographical distribution were recorded and analyzed. Results All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only. Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations. The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions. Conclusions There was a significant change in the health service provision of Chinese public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic and wider use of telehealth in the eastern region.

Although the authorities have taken proactive measures to combat COVID-19, the case count from the SARS-CoV-2 soared continually.

Meanwhile, prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment is a risk of aerosol transmission [3] . The literature showed that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and blood and have the potential to spread such infections to dental personnel and other people in the dental office [4] .

There would be a potential risk for transmission of acute viral respiratory tract infections during dental procedures because of aerosol production [6] . Thus, according to the guidelines of the Chinese Stomatological Association (CSA) [7] , suspending general non-emergency dental treatment has potential importance in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, it may have a negative impact on patients' dental health or treatment effects, such as the prolonged orthodontic treatment time. Patients' psychological status (e.g., fear of infection) would also affect the progression of oral mucosa diseases [8] . There have been online questionnaires supplied by some public tertiary dental hospitals to identify whether their dental patients were anxious or worried about the delayed dental visit. Although the public dental hospitals still offered emergency treatments for patients, significant utilization reduction in emergency dental services was observed at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic [5] . Some dental specialists were also concerned about exploding visits after the end of the epidemic. The strengths of administrative departments of the government are suggested to be coordinated to implement comprehensive prevention and control measures in future dental care. However, there should be further studies about the long-term socioeconomic, psychological, or physical impacts of the current provision of dental services during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this report, the supply of online dental consultation was significantly different between hospitals in different regions. The penetration rate was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of central/western regions (87.0% vs. 52.0%), which might be related to the economic development and oral health status. The online consultation, being a subset of teledentistry, provides education and preventive care to dental patients and has the potential to identify high-risk populations [9] . It is an innovative method of oral health service delivery that can connect dental practitioners and patients. This is important particularly for underserved oral care due to the COVID-19 epidemic or other reasons like geographical barriers or dental workforce shortages. The efficacy and benefits of online dental consultation have supported it integrating into routine dental health service [10] , and the wide application during the epidemic would help its extensive promotion. The development of consultation software or apps was desired not only by patients but also by medical specialists, for better data consolidation, to access patients' previous medical records and facilitate their referrals to dental hospitals or clinics. The encouragement of online dental consultation should be enhanced especially for rural and remote areas in central and western regions to improve their locally based medical care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 261, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 346, "end": 349, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1122, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2083, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2479, "end": 2483, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Within the limitation of this report, we observed significant changes in the health service provision of Chinese public tertiary hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic.
