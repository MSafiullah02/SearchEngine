It enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and utilizes small GTPase Rab proteins such as PmRab5 and PmRab7 for intracellular trafficking. In this study, molecular cloning and functional analysis of Rab11 during YHV infection were investigated. PmRab11 cDNA was cloned by Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACEs). It contained two forms of sizes 1200 and 1050 bp distinct at the 5\u02b9 UTR. The coding region of PmRab11 was 645 bp, encoding 214 amino acids. It also demonstrated the characteristics of Rab11 proteins containing five GTP-binding domains, five Rab family domains, four Rab subfamily domains and a prenylation site at the C-terminus. Suppression of PmRab11 using dsRNA-PmRab11 either before or after YHV-challenge resulted in significant inhibition of YHV levels in the hemocytes and viral release in the supernatant in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the silencing effect of PmRab11 in YHV-infected shrimps resulted in a delay in shrimp mortality for at least 2 days. Immunofluorescence study showed co-localization between PmRab11 and YHV at 24e72 h post YHV-challenge. In contrast, the co-localization signals were absence in the PmRab11 knockdown hemocytes and the YHV signals accumulated at the perinuclear region at 24 h post YHV-challenge. Then, accumulation of YHV was hardly observed after 48e72 h. These results suggested that PmRab11 is required for YHV infection in shrimp.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Thailand is the world's important exporter of shrimp products, especially the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon.

YHV is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is classified as a member of Gill-associated virus, belonging to the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae in the order Nidovirales [3] . YHV genome is approximately 26 kb, containing four long open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2, and ORF3) [4e6] . The enveloped rod-shaped YHV particles are 150e200 nm in length and 40e50 nm in diameter [1, 7] . The virion has prominent surface spikes and contains internal helical nucleocapsid [8, 9] .

However, this exocytosis process of YHV out of the cells is not well understood. Normally, enveloped viruses are budded at the membrane in order to generate the envelope that surrounded the nucleocapsid [14] . In this process, the nucleocapsid is wrapped in a cellular membrane containing virus-specific envelope proteins. The viral envelope protein serves to target the host cell receptor [15] . Some viruses bud at the plasma membrane (PM), whereas others are assembled and budded at intracellular membranes along the secretory pathway such as the nuclear envelope, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosomes, intermediate or pre-Golgi compartment, Golgi cisternae and the trans-Golgi-network (TGN) [16] .

The Rab GTPase protein acts as molecular switches that shuffle between two conformational states, the GTP bound 'active' form and the GDP-bound 'inactive' form. In the active form, Rab protein is associated with membranes by hydrophobic geranylgeranyl groups at the C-terminal and recruited the specific effector molecules such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases and motor proteins in vesicle transport process [18] . Our previous studies found that several Rab proteins are hijacked by YHV [11, 12] . Specifically, the transportation of YHV particles required PmRab5 which is a key protein in vesicles transport to early endosome; whereas, PmRab7 is involved in YHV transportation from early endosome to late endosome and lysosome.

The earlier studies of other (\u00fe) ssRNA viruses such as flaviviruses and coronaviruses found that viral budding from TGN to PM is dependent on Rab11-mediated pathway through cytoskeleton network [34, 35] . Interestingly, Rab11 of YHV-infected shrimp was shown to be upregulated after 24 h of infection [26] . A comparative proteomic analysis showed that the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was increased during YHV infection [36] . PDI is normally localized in the lumen of ER catalyzing the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds [37] .

The nucleotide deletion at the 5\u02b9 end of the two forms has not been observed for other Rab11. However, at least three isoforms of Rab11 proteins such as Rab11A, Rab11B and Rab11C (occasionally called Rab25) have been reported and shown to localize differently at specific organelles. Rab11A and B localize at the Golgi, RE and early endosomes and may be involved in membrane trafficking pathway by transportation of the target protein from TGN/RE to plasma membrane [39] . While Rab11C is expressed only in certain epithelial cells and may be involved in vesicular trafficking from recycling endosome to plasma membrane [39, 40] .

This is in contrast to the result of PmRab11 knockdown alone (without YHV infection) that PmRab11 expression was inhibited more than 90% at this time point (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, subtractive hybridization found that Rab11 was upregulated at 24 h post-YHV infection [26] . Therefore, it is possible that an incomplete PmRab11 knockdown is caused by upregulation of PmRab11 expression in response to YHV infection. In addition, viral titre inside and outside the cell was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that YHV levels in hemocytes and supernatant of PmRab11 knockdown group were significantly decreased from 48 to 72 h post-YHV infection when compared to the NaCl-injected group. Notably, not only PmRab11 expression was recovered at 120 h post-dsRNA injection, but also the YHV released was increase at this time point.

Unfortunately, our Rab11 antibody cannot be used to detect Rab11 protein by Western blot under the denaturing condition, suggesting that it required the native structure of epitopes. The results revealed that YHV protein level cannot be observed in both fractions of all experimental groups at 24 h post-dsRNA injection (Fig. 6 ). Previous study in PmRab5 knockdown during YHV infection found that YHV is internalized and transported via PmRab5 from PM to early endosome around 10 mine6 h post-infection [10] . After that, viral replication occurred and nucleocapsid was found in cytoplasm at 24 h post-YHV infection [13] . Thus, the, low level of YHV-gp64 protein at the early phase of infection and the failure to detect the protein in Western blot at this time point. At 48 h post-dsRNA injection, high YHV protein level in the NaCl-injected group can be observed. Whereas, the dsRNA-GFP injected group showed low YHV protein level at this time point. Many studies found that the innate antiviral immunity in invertebrates including shrimp was induced by any dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner [45, 46] . High levels YHV protein in hemocytes and supernatant of the NaCl injected group and dsRNA-GFP injected group could be observed at 72 h. In contrast, YHV levels could not be detected in both fractions of PmRab11 knockdown group at 24e72 h post-dsRNA injection. For the (\u00fe) ssRNA virus including YHV, the replication process occurs in the cytoplasm [47] and the viral envelop glycoproteins are co-translationally inserted into ER membranes. Then, modification of the glycoproteins occurs during their passage through the secretory pathway. For example, all structural proteins of members of the Flaviviridae family such as hepatitis C and dengue virus are co-translated as a single polyprotein and are inserted into the ER membrane [48] . An individual glycoprotein is generated by proteolytic cleavage and the RNA-binding core protein that is known as the nucleocapsid is assembled within the ER, and transported to Golgi apparatus. It is possible that these events may also occur for YHV which is one of the (\u00fe) ssRNA. The single polyprotein containing gp116 and gp64 is co-translated and inserted into the ER membrane. The proteolytic cleavage resulted in individual gp116 and gp 64 that exposed the N-terminal domain to the cytosolic side [7] . Then, the viral nucleocapsid and glycoproteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus for maturation. At TGN, the budding of YHV envelope virion can be observed under electron microscope [2, 13] . Normally, Rab11 is involved in the vesicle transport from TGN to the PM [49] . After PmRab11 knockdown, YHV cannot bud and has no target organelle to transport to. Therefore, the YHV protein in Golgi network might be transported to lysosome for degradation. However, the mechanism in this process remains to be elucidated. Similar results can be observed in the dengue virus [50] . In addition, the mortality assay revealed that injection of dsRNA-PmRab11 can delay shrimp mortality when compared to both control groups. Similar results of the delay in shrimp mortalities can be demonstrated for the knockdown effects of other Rab proteins including PmRab7 and PmRab5 during YHV infection [11, 12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1287, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1291, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1645, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2028, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2535, "end": 2538, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2731, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2735, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2810, "end": 2814, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3113, "end": 3117, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3427, "end": 3431, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3435, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 502, "end": 509, "text": "(Fig. 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Co-localization between YHV and PmRab11 was observed by immunofluorescence assay.
