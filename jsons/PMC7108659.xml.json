Specimens referable to R. madagascariensis were collected from 17 sites on Madagascar and those to R. obliviosus from 3 different islands in the Comoro Islands (Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li). No evidence of the latter species was found on Mayotte. Voucher specimens are deposited in the Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago) and the Universit\u00e9 d'Antananarivo, D\u00e9partement de Biologie Animale (Antananarivo, Madagascar). Small muscle samples from each collected individual were preserved in ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid before specimen preparation. Research involving live animals followed the guidelines for the capture, handling, and care of mammals approved by the American Society of Mammalogists (Gannon et al. 2007). Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California).",

We amplified the entire Cytb region for 44 samples of R. obliviosus and 131 samples of R. madagascariensis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers L14724 and H15915 (Irwin et al. 1991). PCR was done in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l with lx buffer (100 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 0.25 \u00b5M of each primer, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase, and 1 \u00b5l of template DNA. PCR cycles consisted of an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min 40 s, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.

Resulting sequences were checked by eye for errors and contigs were assembled in Sequencher 4.8 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Sequences were checked for stop codons and deposited in GenBank (accession numbers GU228597\u2013GU228771; Appendix 1).

Peterson et al.

This was readdressed by Bergmans (1994), who was able to compare specimens of R. madagas-cariensis with R. obliviosus.

Nothing is known about dispersal patterns of R. madagascariensis, but on the basis of genetic data presented here, dispersal movements are large scale. A possible explanation for this can be found in the unusual phenological patterns in fruiting of certain native plant genera, such as Ficus (Moraceae), resulting in a local paucity of food for frugivores during certain seasons, forcing obligate fruit-eating species to disperse (Goodman and Ganzhorn 1997). This potentially could explain lack of phylogeographic structure in R. madagascariensis. Even more striking is that a similar pattern of no phylogeographic structure was found in populations of R. obliviosus on Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li, with open-water distances separating these islands between 40 and 80 km.",

As witnessed by 4 of the 10 species in the genus being island endemics (Giannini et al. 2009), these animals have limited capacity to disperse across considerable oceanic distances. In certain cases these events are seemingly rare, having resulted in isolated populations that speciated, and in other cases they remain in contact with other island or continental populations (Bastian et al. 2001). To understand the importance of distance across water crossings as an isolation factor in different populations of Rousettus spp., we present here some examples that do not necessarily rely on the same genetic markers.",

The direct distance from Madagascar to the nearest island in the Comoros, Mayotte (where the sister taxa R. obliviosus is unknown to occur), is 300 km and to Anjouan (where R. obliviosus does occur), 390 km. The latter volcanic island formed in situ about 3.7 Myr (Nougier et al. 1986). Given that R. obliviosus and R. madagascariensis are sister taxa and share no common haplotype, this distance of Overwater dispersal is sufficiently great to have been a rare event that subsequently led to speciation. Within Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li, which are separated by a maximum distance of 80 km, no island-specific genetic structure at mitochondrial or nuclear markers is found, and these animals seemingly cross this water distance with some frequency.",

As far as we are aware, genetic sequence data are not available from these populations, but on the basis of allozyme variation, populations occurring on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are different from those on the mainland, and they have been described as endemic subspecies, R. aegyptiacus princepsJuste and Iba\u00f1ez, 1993 and R. a. tomensisJuste and Iba\u00f1ez, 1993 (Juste and Iba\u00f1ez 1993; Juste et al. 1996).
