            "text": "With 200 million people infected worldwide, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become a global health problem and a major cause of viral hepatitis. Persistent infection occurs in 70% of infected patients followed by some serious complications such as inflammation, insulin resistance, steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathology associated with chronic HCV infection was initially thought to be related with HCV-specific immune responses [1, 2] . But now there are some who view that direct cytopathic effects (CPEs) in virally infected cells also contribute substantially to HCV-associated liver injury [3, 4] . The cellular mechanisms by which HCV replication might mediate liver injury are not entirely clear. Sekine-Osajima et al investigated the cellular effects of HCV infection and replication using the HCV-JFH1 cell culture system and found that HCV-JFH1 infected cells contained substantial CPE that was characterized by massive apoptotic cell death with much expression of several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced proteins [5] . Moreover, in HCV-JFH1 transfected Huh-7.5.1 cells, death occurred when all the cells were infected and the intracellular HCV RNA reached maximum levels [6] . Mishima et al further identified that mutant viruses with individual C2441S, P2938S, or R2985P signature substitutions enhanced virus replication and protein expression in the early/acute stages of infection, which finally led to massive cell death [7] . In addition, they also found that HCV-induced cytopathogenicity was closely associated with the level of intracellular viral replication and determined by certain amino acid substitutions in HCV-NS5A and -NS5B regions. Unfortunately, all of these studies were based on a recombinant virus model of liver cancer cells, and there are inevitable metabolic differences existing between hepatoma cell lines and quiescent primary hepatocytes. It is apparent that these cell lines cannot fully recapitulate all aspects of HCV infection in the liver, or the host responses playing important roles in determination of viral persistence or clearance [8] . In our previous study, we have established an infection system based on human fetal liver stem cells (hFLSCs) which could completely exhibit the entire blood-borne HCV (bbHCV) life cycle including transmission of the virus efficiently between cells. In the process of model building, we found that mitochondrial alterations and ER stress contribute a lot to our better understanding of HCV pathogenesis and provide insight 156 X Guo et al into the HCV life cycle. Therefore, we focused on using this cell model to investigate the effect of HCV infection on cells in vitro.",

In order to further assess whether infected cells were involved in an apoptotic process, we performed annexin V staining with flow cytometry analysis; and found that the levels of annexin V positivity increased with the extending of time and reached a peak of 29.8% within hFLSC at 16 h postinfection, and then declined after 48 h postinfection ( Figure 2B ,C and supplementary material, Figure S2 ).

We found that Bax activation and clustering to mitochondria occurred in 20% of bbHCV infected cells at 16 h postinfection ( Figure 4A ), but decreased after 24 h postinfection. It is well known that Bax activation could induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization [12] . We then investigated the effect of bbHCV infection on mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). The proportion of cells with decreased \u0394\u03a8m in bbHCV-infected cells is much higher than that in controls ( Figure 4B and supplementary material, Figure S3 ).

Finally, we sought to determine whether HCV could lead to the activation of terminal caspases by using anti-caspase-3 antibody which could recognize both the procaspase and the cleaved active caspase 3 p11 subunit. We found the p11 cleaved active subunit of the caspase-3 at 16 h postinfection ( Figure 5B ). These results demonstrated that bbHCV infection could definitively induce an advanced apoptotic process at the early stage of infection. infected cells, whereas Thr 308 phosphorylation levels were not significantly altered after infection with bbHCV ( Figure 5E ). Simultaneously, increased expression of TYMS, JUND, and UBD mRNAs, whose protein functions relate to the decrease of p53 levels and the supply of a protective effect against p53-dependent apoptosis, suggested that the cell counteracted the activation of the p53 signaling pathway ( Figure 5F ). understanding of HCV pathogenesis. In our system, CPEs induced by bbHCV infection including ER distention, mitochondrial swelling and cell vacuolization were similar to cell lesions derived from chronic HCV patients. The mechanisms of the pathogenesis induced by bbHCV infection might be traced back to ER-stress and mitochondria-related/caspase-dependent apoptosis in hFLSCs at the early stages of infection. With time going on, apoptosis would gradually be inhibited by the increasing expression of bcl-XL, the activation of NF-\u03baB, the survival pathway of PI3-kinase-AKT/PKB, and the sequestering of p53. NF-\u03baB activation disrupts the balance between the survival cells and the infected cells by inhibiting apoptosis. The accelerated cycles of cell apoptosis, regeneration and repair resulting from HCV infection could shorten the cell death cycle and give rise to the development of cirrhosis, and ultimately lead to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",

            "text": "It has been reported that the PI3K/AKT and/or NF-\u03baB signaling pathways could lead to upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 [14] . Then, the HIF-1\u03b1 subunit being located in nuclei could cause inhibition of respiratory activity, with depression of the mitochondrial complex I along with uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency [15] . Our data also provided a strong demonstration that ATP production increased in cells infected by bbHCV. An over-compensatory glycolytic metabolic response might be responsible for the phenomenon above by impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. In addition, bbHCV-induced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation impairment is associated with oxidative stress that clearly tracks to the mitochondrial compartment where the ROS O 2\u2212 is first formed; then the ROS O 2\u2212 triggers the permeability transition pore through which cytochrome c could be released and diffuse into the cytosol. Ultimately, the cytochrome c would induce the apoptotic program and cause subsequent cell damage. fibrosis, a severe form of hepatitis [16] . EM of HCV RNA-positive liver biopsies showed that the hepatocytes would undergo vacuolation and lysis of membrane organelles, degeneration of mitochondria, dilatation of cytoplasmic reticulum tubules, and formation of an appreciable amount of large polymorphic secondary phagosomes [17] . Kasprzak et al summed up the data on nuclear lesions of liver biopsies with chronic HCV infection, involving swelling, altered shape, hyperchromasia, disturbed nuclear chromatin structure; and the nuclear lesions always occurred in the cells with changes in rough ER within long tubular structures or branching fibrils inside [18] . Other cytoplasmic changes included mitochondrial lesions, numerous lipid vacuoles and free tubular structure of a highly osmiophilic character [18] . Similarly, Falc\u00f3n et al studied liver biopsies from patients with chronic HCV infection [19] . They found that all liver biopsy samples from these 13 chronically HCV-infected patients showed ultrastructural cell damage. Ballooning hepatocytes with dilatation of the ER and mitochondria were observed. More importantly, studies have shown that fibrosis progress was more vulnerable in coinfected patients with HIV than that in monoinfected patients, leading to the increasing rates of cirrhosis and complications [20, 21] . The loss of secondary immunity against HCV could provide a possible explanation for the higher persistence rate of HCV in the coinfection patients with HIV, and histologic variants in liver biopsy specimens of coinfected individuals might be due to the direct cytopathic activity of HCV [22] . In contrast, Seong-Jun et al conducted EM to observe Huh7 cells harboring HCV full length replicon (JFH1), which revealed prominent clustering of mitochondria in the perinuclear regions within HCV infected cells and a dramatic loss of mitochondrial cristae compared with the uninfected cells [23] . Katze et al attempted to gain insight into the mechanisms of HCV-associated cell death by performing microarray experiments on Huh-7.5 cells infected with HCV-J6/JFH [24] . The presence of activated caspase-3 and cell death-related genes both strongly indicated that HCV infection was associated with a direct CPE. A wealth of published literature has referred to some experiments in which one or more HCV proteins could induce cytopathogenicity in cultured hepatocytes. Core protein has been reported to have both pro-and anti-apoptotic effects on death ligand mediated hepatocyte apoptosis [25, 26] . The HCV envelope protein 162 X Guo et al E2 has been found to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis and induce mitochondria-related/caspase-dependent apoptosis in hepatoma cell line [27] . Perturbations of apoptotic pathways have also been demonstrated with the nonstructural proteins [28] [29] [30] [31] .",
