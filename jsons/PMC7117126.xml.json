PRRS is endemic in most pork-producing countries and it is responsible for major economic losses to the swine industry, with an estimated annual loss of $664 million to the US economy (Holtkamp and Kliebenstein, 2011). Clinical signs of PRRS in pigs include fever, anorexia, and respiratory disease; and poor reproductive performance in pregnant pigs is characterized by abortions, mummified fetus, and weak-born piglets (Done et al., 1996). The causal agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV) and it is an enveloped, positive sense, single-strand RNA virus, belongs to the family Arteriviridae (King et al., 2011).",

            "text": "PRRSV modulates the pig immune system as early as two-days, and continues several weeks post-infection (Dwivedi et al., 2012, Mateu and Diaz, 2008). In PRRSV infected pigs production of an important Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3 is delayed and in reduced amounts. The immune modulation caused by PRRSV is attributed to virus-mediated suppression of host IFN-\u03b1 production (Albina et al., 1998). In addition, the virus helps in induction of secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and upregulation of Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs) (Silva-Campa et al., 2012). Virus neutralizing (VN) antibody is important for viral clearance, but the role of VN antibodies in clearing the PRRSV in infected pigs is unclear (Diaz et al., 2005). However, passive transfer of VN antibodies has shown to provide protection against PRRSV challenge (Osorio et al., 2002). To control PRRS outbreaks modified live PRRSV vaccine (PRRS-MLV) is widely used and it confers protection against homologous virus, but incomplete protection against reinfections and heterologous viruses (Mengeling et al., 2003). There are limitations of PRRS-MLV, as there are reports of appearance of revertant vaccine virus in certain pigs (Li et al., 2009, Mengeling et al., 2002, Nielsen et al., 2001). Available killed vaccines are safe, but their efficacy is poor (Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004, Charerntantanakul, 2009, Piras et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Stimulating the immune system systemically results mainly in systemic protection with low mucosal immune responses. In contrast, optimum stimulation of the mucosal immune system provides both mucosal and systemic immunity, resulting in inhibition of entry of pathogens into the body (Holmgren et al., 1992). Nanotechnology based vaccine delivery system is an innovation of the 21st century (Panyam and Labhasetwar, 2003). Nanoparticles offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of drug and vaccine delivery, and also possess adjuvant properties (Gupta et al., 1998). Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticle-mediated delivery of vaccines has shown to be effective in eliciting protective immune response, administered by either mucosal and systemic routes (Eldridge et al., 1989, Spiers et al., 2000). PLGA is biocompatible, biodegradable, and protects the entrapped vaccine from proteases mediated degradation at mucosal surfaces; and it is a FDA approved agent (Lu et al., 2009). PLGA helps in sustained release of entrapped vaccine, and thus limits the need of booster doses (Thomasin et al., 1996). Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop PLGA nanoparticle-encapsulated PRRSV killed vaccine and investigate its efficacy in pigs vaccinated by intranasal route. Our results suggest that our strategy has the potential to generate anti-PRRSV immune response and in better clearance of viremia.",

We used the VR2332 strain which was passaged several times (\u223c50) in vitro, and the lack of obvious clinical disease may have been due to attenuation. Macroscopically, typical PRRS lung lesions were not very distinct; therefore, in this paper we did not make any comparative lung lesion analyses, but reported the comprehensive immunological data in relation to viremia. PRRSV neutralizing antibodies protect pigs against viremia, virus replication in the lungs, and transplacental spread of the virus (Lopez et al., 2007, Lopez and Osorio, 2004), but the commercial killed vaccines induce negligible VN antibody response (Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004, Vanhee et al., 2009). A study demonstrated that it is possible to elicit increased VN titers to a killed PRRSV vaccine by inactivating the virus using UV or binary ethylenimine and by coadministering the vaccine with a potent adjuvant (Vanhee et al., 2009). In that study amount of inactivated PRRSV in each vaccine dose was 1 \u00d7 108 TCID50 (Vanhee et al., 2009). In our study, each vaccine dose had approximately 5 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of UV-treated virus, suggesting PLGA nanoparticle-based intranasal delivery of killed PRRSV vaccine needs significantly reduced virus amount to elicit anti-PRRSV immune response. Recently, it was shown that PLGA nanoparticle-based tumor antigenic peptides vaccine delivery could reduce the required vaccine dose by 63 times (Ma et al., 2012); indicating that such a delivery system has the potential to significantly reduce the required amount of killed PRRSV antigens in each dose.",

            "text": "PRRSV VN antibody in the serum was shown to be important for viral clearance (Lopez et al., 2007, Lopez and Osorio, 2004, Osorio et al., 2002), but it needs to be further investigated due to lack of complete virus clearance even in the presence of VN antibodies in pigs (Diaz et al., 2005) (Michael Murtaugh, personal communication). Although porcine lung Ig is primarily IgG, generation of protective IgA response is essential to reduce the entry of pathogens whose principle port of entry is through mucosal surfaces (McGhee et al., 1992). Mucosal immunization elicits production of IgA antibodies (Ogra and Karzon, 1969), and the IgA antibody is protective in clearing the virus infection by their virus neutralization activity (Liew et al., 1984). But, we lack convincing studies about the role of lung IgA in PRRSV clearance in infected or vaccinated pigs. In this study the levels of PRRSV specific IgA antibody in the lungs of both Nano-KAg and K-Ag vaccinated pigs was found to be high and comparable; but, significant increase in lung VN titers was detected only in Nano-KAg received pigs. Further, in Nano-KAg immunized pigs increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 response was observed both in the lungs and blood. In the serum of pigs unvaccinated or vaccinated with K-Ag and virus challenged, detectable VN titers were absent. But, Nano-KAg vaccine induced low levels of VN titers (1:2 and 1:4) in serum, and it might be due to nonspecific effects, as such low titers did not boost upon the viral challenge. This suggests the need of a potent adjuvant and/or a booster dose of the Nano-KAg vaccine to induce high PRRS VN titers in the serum. Further analysis in the lymphoid tissues and lungs is necessary to confirm the effect of Nano-KAg vaccine in viral clearance in challenged animals.",

Biodegradable and biocompatible PLGA nanoparticles are free from any toxicity, safe to use, and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (Duncan, 2005). In our study, PLGA nanoparticles did not induce any toxic symptoms in vaccinated pigs. Further, due to particulate nature of nanoparticles and the inherent ability of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) to passively phagocytoze particulate antigens (Inaba et al., 1993), nanoparticle-based delivery of vaccines to mucosal sites is advantageous. To note, abundant populations of APCs are present at mucosal tissues and lymphoid organs; and in BAL fluid of mice, humans, and pigs greater than 90% of cells are macrophages, suggesting that intranasally administered Nano-KAg was probably phagocytozed by alveolar macrophages. Earlier studies with killed influenza virus vaccine entrapped in nanoparticles administered with an adjuvant intranasally to mice, rabbits, and pigs elicited protective immune response and the response induced in pigs was significantly better than by intramuscular vaccination (Singh et al., 2001). Therefore, innovative nanotechnology based intranasal vaccine delivery is an attractive alternative approach to deliver killed PRRSV vaccine to pigs.",

The cytokine IL-12 plays an important role in host defense against viral infections by inducing IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells, and also helps in differentiation of Th1 cell phenotype (Kaplan et al., 1996). Co-administration of IL-12 and PRRS-MLV enhanced the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells (Foss et al., 2002). Enhanced secretion of Th1 cytokines is associated with protective cell-mediated immune response in mice delivered intranasally with PLGA-based hepatitis B virus vaccine (Jaganathan and Vyas, 2006). In addition, we also observed significantly increased myeloid and dendritic cell rich population in LMNC and PBMC of Nano-KAg compared to K-Ag vaccinated pigs. Unlike other non-lymphoid tissues the lung contains a large fraction of effector and central memory CD8+ T lymphocytes (Anderson et al., 2012, Unsoeld and Pircher, 2005); in fact, even na\u00efve lymphocytes are present in the perfused lung (Cose et al., 2006).
