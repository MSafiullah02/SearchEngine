            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which are responsible for enteric and/or respiratory disease in mammals and birds. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is usually responsible for mild enteritis in young dogs (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011), although fatal disease has been associated to a pantropic variant of the virus (Decaro et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2010a, Decaro et al., 2012, Marinaro et al., 2010, Zicola et al., 2012, Ntafis et al., 2012). Based on the genetic distance encountered in the spike (S) protein gene (Pratelli et al., 2003), two CCoV genotypes are known, CCoV type I (CCoV-I) and type II (CCoV-II), which are variously distributed worldwide (Decaro et al., 2005, Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2013, McElligott et al., 2011; Ntafis et al., 2013, Licitra et al., 2014, Cavalli et al., 2014, Costa et al., 2014). CCoV-II has been found to exist in two different subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, the latter being the result of homologous recombination with transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) (Decaro et al., 2009, Decaro et al., 2010b). Intermediate viruses between CCoV-I and CCoV-II have been also detected (Town and Whittaker, 2012).",

The feces were collected by a vet directly from the rectal ampulla into a sterile container during the clinical examination of the dog. CCoV-I RNA detection in the specimen was obtained by means of genotype-specific PCR (Pratelli et al., 2004) and real-time RT-PCR (Decaro et al., 2005). Virus isolation attempts using different cell lines of canine and feline origin were unsuccessful, since CCoV-I has not been adapted to the in vitro growth (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011).

The 5\u2032 UTR consists of 313 nt including the leader sequence (L, nt 1\u201394) and the conserved core 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032 (nt 95\u2013100) of the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), which controls the mRNA synthesis through interaction with the viral polymerase during the discontinuous transcription of the negative strand subgenomic RNA of the Nidovirales members (Enjuanes et al., 2000). Similar TRS signals precede each of the 8 putative mRNA encoding for the structural and nonstructural proteins (Table 1). The 3\u2032 end of the viral genome consists of a 274-nt 3\u2032 UTR that is followed by the poly(A) tail. Sequence analysis showed intact structural and non-structural proteins with respect to reference CCoV-II, FCoV-I and FCoV-II genomes. About two-thirds of the viral genome is occupied by the replicase gene encoding for two large polyproteins (pp), pp1a and pp1ab, the latter being synthesized through ribosomal slippage at position 12,327. The polyproteins of the replicase complex are processed by viral proteinases, resulting in several products with different size and function. Sequence comparison with other Alphacoronavirus-1 genomes led to the detection of three putative papain-like proteinase cleavage sites and 11 putative 3C-like proteinase cleavage sites, producing 16 nonstructural proteins (Table 2\n).",

Therefore, in the present study we have carried out the complete genome sequence analysis for this canine pathogen. The results showed that the CCoV-I genome displays some distinct features with respect to CCoV-II and other alphacoronaviruses. The first finding is the presence of an additional accessory protein gene, ORF3, which was located between the S protein gene and ORF3a. This additional gene, which has been recently characterized, was found to be unique to the CCoV-I genome, whereas CCoV-II and TGEV exhibit only 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end remnants (Lorusso et al., 2008). However, FCoV strains harboring different forms of ORF3 and a CCoV-I N protein gene have been detected, thus proving the circulation of FCoV-I/CCoV-I recombinant viruses (Le Poder et al., 2013). Another finding of the CCoV-I genome is that the S protein gene is closely related to that of FCoV-I, whereas the rest of the genome displays a higher relatedness to CCoV-II. In addition, a furin cleavage site leads to the potential generation of two subunits, S1 and S2. A similar basic motif is present, approximately in the same position, in most beta- and gammacoronaviruses. Cleavage of the CoV S protein has been correlated to cell-fusion activity in vitro but the potential implications in viral pathobiology have not been fully determined (Hingley et al., 1998). In addition to CCoV-I, furin cleavage motifs have been detected in FCoV-I, but even in this case the biological consequences were not completely understood (de Haan et al., 2008). Unlike CCoV-II and FCoV-II that display a similar S protein as a consequence of homologous recombination, CCoV-I does not grow in cell cultures and only few FCoV-I strains have been adapted to grow in vitro. The CoV S protein interacts with cell receptors, thus being responsible for binding of virions to the cell surface (Enjuanes et al., 2000). Thus, the different S proteins between CCoV-I/FCoV-I and CCoV-II/FCoV-II are likely to be responsible for the diverse biological behaviors in cell cultures. The cell receptor for most Alphacoronavirus-1 isolates is the cell surface glycoprotein aminopeptidase N (APN), but there is no evidence for this receptor being used by CCoV-I/FCoV-I (de Haan et al., 2008).",
