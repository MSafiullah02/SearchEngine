However, of the 304 recruited cases, most had bacterial infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and only seven (2\u00b73%) were diagnosed as having influenza pneumonia (nine others [3\u00b70%] had mixed influenza-bacterial infections, mostly S pneumoniae). As such, the results cannot be generalised to community-acquired pneumonia with viral causes.",

Evidence suggests that corticosteroid use in influenza pneumonia cannot control excessive inflammation, but compromises the immune response, leading to longer viral shedding, secondary bacterial and fungal infections, and even increased mortality (webappendix).3, 4 Controlled studies are needed to address the use of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia and its safety. Notably, in viral pneumonia caused by the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, increased viral load has been documented with corticosteroid treatment in a randomised trial.5\n",
