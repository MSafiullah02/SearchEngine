(which was not certified by peer review) Introduction SARS-CoV-2 is the causative pathogen for COVID-19 and was first identified in December 2019 after a series of cases of pneumonia were linked to a live animal and seafood market in Wuhan, China. 1 It soon spread rampantly throughout the world resulting in a pandemic that has infected over 1.7 million people and led to over 100,000 deaths as of 12 th April 2020. 2 While South East Asia may have been expected to be the region most affected due to its geographical proximity and travel relationship with Wuhan, it has been cooler, further Experiments on coronaviruses in controlled environments show that conditions conducive to its survival are at temperatures around 4\u00b0C and relative humidity between 20-80%. 3 In these conditions, coronaviruses can survive up to 28 days. Inactivation of the viruses occurs rapidly above 20\u00b0C. When temperatures reach close to 40\u00b0C, the coronaviruses last only a few hours at most. 3, 4 Epidemiological data on environmental factors in the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic 5-7 showed a significant increase of up to 18-fold in case numbers on cooler days, suggesting that coronaviruses transmit more efficiently during colder weather. 6 .

[15] [16] [17] [18] The reasons for this enhanced viral spread during colder weather may be due to enhanced shedding of the virus during colder weather 17, 19 , stability of the virus suspended in air droplets 20 or increased viability on nasal mucus membranes cooled by surrounding air. 21 Additionally, cold weather can impair the immune system by inhibiting nasal mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis, diminishing the protective properties of mucus in upper airways 22 , or predispose to vitamin D deficiency due to lower exposure to ultraviolet radiation making people more susceptible to the infection. 23 Based on our analysis, countries should incorporate ambient temperature forecasts into account when developing risk prediction models and even calculating R-nought (number of people one infected person subsequently infects). With no country yet reporting more than 1% of the population infected, the potential beneficial public health effects of \"herd immunity\" (at-risk people protected from infection because they are surrounded by immune individuals) is still out of reach and it is likely that it will be months to years before a vaccine becomes available for widespread use. 24 Therefore, strict application of public health strategies such as lockdowns, social distancing, testing and contact tracing should be strongly considered for countries heading into temperatures that range between 4\u00b0C and 18\u00b0C.

This is important, as a vast proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 can remain asymptomatic and freely mix with the general population, transmitting the virus. [25] [26] [27] Extrapolating the 2019 temperature data (as shown in Figure 3 ) for the remaining 2020 year, it is possible to predict when regions may approach this dangerous temperature range for enhanced viral transmission. For example, Victoria, Australia will enter this band in mid-May and remain in it until mid-October. Later in the year, with the onset of the Northern hemisphere winter, New York, Italy and Hubei will be in the band again from late October onwards. The identification of these at-risk time periods will aid governments and public health authorities in planning their surveillance and monitoring activities to counter the risk of recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks",

Studies showed that the median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 5 days 9 and the mean time to death from symptom onset was 18 days 10 and we used these numbers in our analysis. However, the incubation period can vary from 2-14 days with 1% of cases occurring after 14 days and time to death can vary according to the clinical course of the disease. 9 This may introduce some imprecision in to the histogram that we presented, but as temperatures are unlikely to change significantly over the course of a few days, the overall impact of these variations is likely to be minimal. Some regions may have under-reported cases due to, for example, lack of available testing or being unaware of their asymptomatic carriers. This will likely underestimate the peak infection incidence as regions with the largest outbreaks will have the highest demand for tests or simply assume people are infected without confirmation testing. Our analysis also does not take into account public health measures such as mandatory lockdowns, social distancing and contact tracing measures that could minimize outbreaks. 28 Other environmental factors such as humidity, windspeed and ultraviolet radiation levels as well as regional factors such as population density and social behaviour may also affect the transmission of coronaviruses and its relationship with ambient temperature. 5 Whilst we are aware that some warmer countries such as Singapore have had clusters of outbreaks 29 , this may relate to foreign imports, spread in air-conditioned buildings maintained at lower temperatures or transmitted from person to person via a fomite harbouring in cooler temperatures such as in refrigerators. 30 Conclusion .

The median temperature for a COVID-19 case was 9.12\u00b0C (10-90 th percentile 4.29-17.97\u00b0C) while the median temperature of the world population for the same period was 18.73\u00b0C (10-90 th percentile 4.09-28.49\u00b0C) with a notional p-value = 5.1 x10 -11 . This is void of sampling error as the world population is 7.163 billion and the world population of cases is 1,605,788. The 9.61\u00b0C difference in temperature between the two samples represented a highly significant difference in temperature distributions between COVID-19 cases and the world population.Deaths Figure 2 demonstrates the difference between the average temperatures at the time of infection for patients that died of COVID-19 compared with the average temperature distribution of the world population during the same time period. The median temperature for a COVID-19 death was 9.72\u00b0C (10-90 th percentile 5.39-14.11\u00b0C) similar to the median temperature for a confirmed case (9.12\u00b0C). In contrast, the median temperature of the world population for the same period was 17.27\u00b0C, (10-90 th percentile 2.57-27.76\u00b0C) which is 7.55\u00b0C warmer with a notional p-value = 1.1 x10 -10 . This is void of sampling error as the world population is 7.163 billion and the world population of deaths is 103,471. There was a strong relationship between average temperature and transmission rates of COVID-19, with at least 80% of the cases and deaths occurring between 4.29\u00b0C and 17.97\u00b0C. Based on our results regarding ambient temperatures and cases and deaths, we explored the relationship of increased SAR-CoV-2 transmission as temperatures approached the median temperature of 9.12\u00b0C. Figure 3 demonstrates the world map with countries/regions shaded in the average temperature bands of the 80% CI (4.29-17.97\u00b0C), 60% CI (5.93-13.02\u00b0C) and cases in the country / region. These bands were derived from the analysis of the world population of cases data presented in Figure 1. During Week 4, the black dots are localized mainly to China where most provinces are within the 40% CI band. During Week 9, the black dots are mainly in Europe and New York which are mostly within the 40% CI band. In order to study the temperature-outbreak relationship further, we selected 6 countries/regions {Hubei, Italy, New York, Singapore, Victoria (Australia) and Nigeria} from the world map and obtained the average temperature every 4 days from the 1 st of January 2019 to the 13 th of April 2020 (Figure 4). These 6 locations were selected after review of geographical data to reflect 3 locations with a high (Hubei, Italy, New York) and 3 locations with a relatively low {Singapore, Victoria (Australia) and Nigeria} prevalence of disease. When considering the 60% confidence interval band, Hubei province, China, was in this band from mid-January until mid-February 2020 -the period in which there was an uncontrolled increase in cases seen in Wuhan, China (Figure 5). Italy was in the same temperature band from mid-November 2019 to end-March 2020. As infection cases escaped China and reached Milan, Italy, temperature conditions were ideal for early uncontrolled growth, eventually occurring in late February and early March (Figure 5). New York, another city with large numbers of international travellers, was significantly colder than Milan in early February and only reached temperatures favourable for virus transmission at the end of February and maintained them throughout March. Corresponding to this temperature pattern, New York experienced its phase of uncontrolled growth in cases in late March/early April (Figure 5). So far, Singapore, Victoria (Australia) and Nigeria have not entered the at-risk temperature band (Figure 5).",
