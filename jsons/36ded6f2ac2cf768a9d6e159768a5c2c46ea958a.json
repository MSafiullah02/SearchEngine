They are pairing efforts to detect viral infection, prevent transmission, and manage patients who are infected, with knowledge of previous seasonal coronavirus outbreaks and growing experience with COVID-19 to craft best-evidence guidance. Recent data show that as many as 25% of patients who are infected remain asymptomatic, and viral shedding may begin up to 48 hours before symptoms appear. Worldwide regulatory authorities remain committed to guidance that is clearly evidence-based. As new information appears, updated guidance produces many similarities, and some differences in these guidance documents, in part deriving from regional and population differences. We here review guidance for detecting and mitigating COVID-19 infections in patients who are on dialysis, noting where there is universal agreement and where there are differences.",

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test kits developed early in this pandemic in Berlin, and deployed by the World Health Organization, assisted many Asian and European countries in limiting infection and \"lowering the peak\" of infected individuals over time. Limited availability and slow deployment of such test kits in places like parts of the United States and Italy hindered efforts to prevent epidemic spread, with rapidly rising numbers of patients overwhelming parts of the health care system. Once the pandemic was established, efforts switched from prevention to mitigation-with efforts to reduce person-toperson viral transmission and protect the most vulnerable parts of the population. Key features of mitigation include patient and health care worker (HCW) education and implementation of strategies to prevent further spread such as social distancing, widespread use of face masks for patients with suspected or confirmed disease to limit transmission, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs and others who have direct contact with patients infected with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Patients on in-center hemodialysis are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 for 2 reasons. First, while the world's population shelters at home to avoid contact with infected individuals, patients who are on in-center dialysis must come together for hours thrice weekly and travel to and from these treatments, increasing possible exposure. Second, patients with end-stage kidney disease who acquire the infection are at higher risk of complication and death due to older age and common comorbidities that increase mortality risk, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and hypertension; and in part because patients with endstage kidney disease may have impaired immune systems. To provide information on how to best protect these patients from COVID-19, we examined the guidance provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, Italy, and India, 1-5 noting where they provide similar guidance and where there are differences (Tables 1 and 2 107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162   163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218 guidance is similar. All guidance documents advise cohorting multiple confirmed cases or PUIs and assigning designated staff to care for them. The majority suggest that supplies be positioned close to hemodialysis chairs and nursing stations to ensure adherence to hand and respiratory hygiene. Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are recommended by all guidance documents. For stable PUIs or patients with confirmed coronavirus, some countries advise hospitalization and admission to an airborne infection isolation room. The US CDC specifically states that an airborne infection isolation room is not needed in the outpatient management of COVID-19 dialysis. While Asian guidance documents advise that PUIs be admitted to an infectious disease ward, others advise that PUIs and patients who are confirmed positive can be dialyzed in the outpatient unit, if clinically stable. This is to be performed in a designated COVID-19 facility, dialysis shift, an isolation room within a facility that treats noninfected patients, or in a separate room with the door closed. If none of these are available, then the advice is to dialyze these patients at the end of the line or corner position of the facility, with separation from other patients by 6 feet in all directions. For patients who are ill with progressive dyspnea, organ dysfunction, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, all guidance documents advise hospitalization.",

            "text": "(v) Resource utilization: The US CDC discusses supply chain management, preserving and prioritizing PPE, extended use of eye and face protection, recycling of PPE, and alternate PPE. They also discuss sick leave policy, cross-training and back-up plans, staff return-to-work guidelines, and after return-to-work guidance. These recommendations are not provided in publications from other countries although they may exist locally. Telemedicine is widely used worldwide, when technically possible, to minimize face-to-face contact. (vi) Home dialysis: There is consistency that patients on home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis continue care at home, and HCWs use telemedicine or other electronic systems for clinical management, with home visits if necessary. Implementation of these recommendations are likely to be resource-and geographydependent. 220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274   275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318  319  320  321  322  323  324  325  326  327  328  329  330 (vii) Some guidance documents advise clinicians to consider reducing the frequency of hemodialysis sessions from 3 to 2 times weekly in patients who tolerate this regimen. This would reduce the need to travel by car or ambulance in the event of a shortage of these means of transport, decrease the risk of infection exposure during transport, and reduce the likelihood of patients on dialysis spreading infection in the dialysis unit or the hospital. There is consensus to implement reduced individual dialysis in extreme shortage crisis conditions. Why might regional differences in guidance exist? In countries where early recognition of endemic infection spread was initiated, aggressive steps to identify and isolate patients with COVID-19 and identify their contacts permitted a prevention plan that limited their local epidemic. In China, recognition of infection was initially slow in Wuhan, but aggressive preventive measures in other parts of the country were probably successful. While some European countries have been successful in containment and prevention, others were less successful and focused on mitigation strategies. Availability and use of diagnostic tests have been major determinants of prevention, best practice, and mitigation. In the United States, the limited and slow dispersal of testing capacity has hindered mitigation efforts. Availability and utility of serologic tests may allow accurate identification of patients who have had COVID-19 and developed immunity, including those who are asymptomatic as well as HCWs who are no longer at risk, hence allowing them to return to work.",

This warning has previously received little attention outside Asia. We now know the importance and priority of such readiness. (ii) Early recognition of new infectious diseases requires a new discipline, awareness, and vigilance. This will require a worldwide effort to record and report symptom clusters, changes in hospitalization, morbidity and mortality rates, and a 21st-century epidemiologic registry. Analytic tools can be used to develop new algorithms to assess changes in population health. A new discipline of worldwide surveillance and early recognition will allow countries to contain infection and prevent pandemics. (iii) If we have a reactive approach, responding to spreading infection rather than anticipating and containing it, we will fail. A welldesigned proactive approach that includes early case identification, careful contact mapping and isolation, and swift implementation of protocols will permit infection containment and substantially reduce population exposure, morbidity, and mortality. (iv) If implemented appropriately, infection prevention works. This can be observed in countries such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and Singapore. Information to date also suggests a limited in-facility transmission in patients on dialysis, most likely related to an infection prevention culture that has been imbedded in the care of these vulnerable patients. (v) Once a pandemic is established, aggressive mitigation techniques such as social distancing, testing for specific organisms, and serologic evidence of infection and immunity are critically important. (vi) Equipment and personnel shortages are predictable during a pandemic. National and perhaps worldwide preparedness for this will require new flexible algorithms and coordinating and sharing resources.",
