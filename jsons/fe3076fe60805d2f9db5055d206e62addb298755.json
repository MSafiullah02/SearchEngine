Since late December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread out from its first epicenter, the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China [1] , and has shortly become a pandemic [2] . Epidemiological data are mainly available for those countries most J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hardly hit by COVID-19, such as People's Republic of China [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , Italy [10] and the USA [11] [12] [13] . More limited information is available for countries like Israel. On the other hand, these surveys mainly deal with clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, in terms of related risk factors or underlying co-morbidities, whereas unsatisfactory information is provided regarding the therapeutic interventions adopted. Furthermore, these studies are mostly clinical reports, case-series, or are designed as specific cohort studies targeting specific populations, and are not conducted at the level of entire communities, for example exploiting computerized clinical records and similar \"real-world data\" [14] . A notable exception is represented by the report published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, that analyzed the characteristics of 72,314 COVID-19 patients, even though only 62% of the entire sample consisted of confirmed cases [3] . Thus, currently available data do not enable to address some crucial research questions, especially in terms of therapeutics [15, 16] .",

            "text": "Our results are in line with a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis pooling together 19 studies (18 from mainland China and one from Australia), the overall sample of which consisted only of confirmed patients according to the procedure of RT-PCR testing [5] . More than half (56%) of the patients were males and the major underlying co-morbidities were hypertension (18.6%), cardiovascular disease (14.4%) and DM (11.9%). In a population-based study evaluating the clinical characteristics of 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the USA [19] the majority of patients were males (54.4%) with a similar pattern of underlying comorbidities, most commonly hypertension (49.7%), followed by obesity (48.3%), DM (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). More than 70% of patients were older than 50 years. In J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f another cross-sectional study, the same pattern of co-morbiditieshypertension (18.6%, p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (14.4%, p<0.001) and DM (11.9%, p<0.001)and male gender predominance (56%, p<0.001) were observed in a population with an average age of 52 years [11] . Thus, it is noticeable that underlying co-morbidities and gender are similar among the different populations, but a mean age discrepancy exists between our cohort (average age of 40.6 years) and the other mentioned studies. This discrepancy might be due to the relative high percentage of young population in Israel where the median age in 2020 is 30.5 years, ten years younger than the populations in the USA and mainland China [20] . This is even more noticeable in particular settings, such as COVID-19 endemic cities, where population (especially, ultraorthodox Jewish populations with a high number of children per family) is even younger with respect to the country.",

This is not surprising given the well-known association between low SES and increased risk for infections [21] .

Regarding the anti-inflammatory properties of colchicine, results from experimental models found that the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated and triggered by different SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, subsequently, can take part in the development of the \"severe adult respiratory distress syndrome\" (ARDS), a complication of the COVID-19 infection [27] [28] [29] [30] . As a major inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome [31] , colchicine could be utilized for the treatment of COVID-19. Currently, three clinical trials are ongoing [27, 32, 33] . However, in our investigation, we failed to detect a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine and colchicine. Even though these drugs had not been administered for anti-viral treatment purposes, we were not able to identify the main reason of such an administration. On the other hand, we can assume that patients receiving these drugs suffer from inflammatory diseases such as RA and SLE in the case of hydroxychloroquine [34] and FMF and gout in the case of colchicine [35, 36] .",
