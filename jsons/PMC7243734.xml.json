During or after a crisis, there may be physical barriers (e.g., flooding) or political mandates (e.g., government orders) that prevent direct, in-person treatment. The model begins by asking whether services can be maintained in the original setting. If the answer is yes, practitioners should proceed with services as usual and reassess the safety of maintaining in-person services daily (or more frequently if warranted by the crisis). Minor changes might be appropriate and have little effect on the treatment implementation. Examples of these modifications include additional time to wash hands and disinfect surfaces and materials at the beginning and end of a shift (in the case of a pandemic) and working with the client at an alternative location (in the case of damage to the client\u2019s home after a natural disaster). If the service setting is preserved\u2014even partially\u2014services should remain as is. If services cannot be maintained in the original setting (i.e., the answer is no in the decision model), consider the second level of the decision model.",

This level also applies to practitioners who function as caregivers to clients living in residential facilities. Clients who are in this category might engage in a high frequency of intense physical aggression, self-injurious behavior, property destruction, or elopement. If practitioners answer yes to the second level of this model, they will need to act quickly. Providers will need to immediately contact caregivers and funding sources to determine the best course of action. Interruption at this level can lead to intrusive interventions (e.g., medical sedation, restraint, seclusion), risk of severe injury, and even death. Funding sources and state agencies (e.g., California\u2019s Department of Developmental Services) might be able to provide resources for the continuity of services (e.g., a location to house and maintain treatment) or offer exceptions to government orders (e.g., allowing staff to work during a pandemic and to be classified as essential workers).",

The model poses the following question: \u201cIs there preexisting caregiver treatment integrity and is it at mastery?\u201d Practitioners will answer yes if preexisting treatment integrity data show mastery of fundamental aspects of the treatment plan. These might include, but are not limited to, antecedent interventions, contingencies of reinforcement for replacement behavior, consequence interventions, and pertinent skill-acquisition targets (e.g., discrimination training, verbal behavior, listener behavior). If these conditions are met, the model recommends a telehealth assessment (e.g., Rodriguez, in press) to target the maintenance and development of the treatment plan through caregiver training. As the treatment modality changes and requires more from the caregivers, practitioners should prioritize maintenance and development to minimize errors of commission.",

Even when maintenance training is used in research, some outcomes show a degree of regression in as soon as 2 weeks. If a crisis occurs before practitioners begin to thin the schedule of reinforcement and fade supplementary antecedent stimuli (i.e., maintenance training), behavior may regress quickly and problem behaviors could resurge or be shaped into more severe forms. Maintenance training might be the best decision within Level 3 depending on the circumstances. Conducting a telehealth assessment (e.g., Rodriguez, in press) will help with prioritizing treatment goals and potentially focusing on maintenance training.

The Council of Autism Service Providers (2020) cautions practitioners to assess individuals for their eligibility for telehealth. They recommend that organizations develop an admission process to determine clinical appropriateness. As such, clients should be assessed on an individualized basis just as in any other service modality that employs ABA. Telehealth trainings will provide information to practitioners who will need to assess the appropriateness of the model.

The BT would follow the treatment plans prescribed by the behavior analyst, who develops and modifies the programming as needed. If the caregiver has little or no stimulus control to maintain the learning setting, it is recommended that practitioners begin caregiver training to maintain the treatment plan and periodically evaluate effectiveness. If ongoing data collection continues to show positive outcomes, it is recommended that the caregiver-led telehealth be maintained as necessary.

            "text": "The final level of the decision model pertains to the reduction of services. It starts with the qualifier that neither the BT via telehealth nor the caregiver has the stimulus control necessary to maintain the treatment effectively and safely. As such, an assessment is needed to see if the caregiver can be trained to gain a degree of stimulus control to maintain the progress of the client. If previously existing data indicate that this is possible (the answer is yes), a telehealth model should be used to (a) promote the development of stimulus control and (b) maintain the treatment outcomes. If data indicate effectiveness, maintain the treatment and reassess for a full telehealth model in Level 4. If maintenance training is ineffective, or if it was previously found that this type of training would not be applicable to the caregiver-client dyad (the answer is no), the subsequent question is whether a caregiver training curriculum could be instituted through telehealth. Factors that might reduce the impact of a caregiver training curriculum (thus making it ineffective) might be related to the caregiver\u2019s technological competence, the lack of generalization observed on other caregiver targets, the impact of the crisis situation, and so on. If the answer is no to the utility of a caregiver training protocol or it has been shown to be ineffective at changing the caregiver\u2019s behavior, the model recommends an interruption of services with periodic check-ins to either reinstate the Level 5 telehealth model or, if the crisis situation passes, resume services as normal. Practitioners should create documentation that illustrates their process for deciding to interrupt services and the conditions that would qualify for their reinstatement.",

Because the ethical dilemma at hand is complex and these decisions require careful consideration and subtlety, some may mistakenly interpret the message of the Cox article as suggesting that ABA services are nonessential. Instead, Cox et al.\u2019s decision model suggests that delivering ABA services in person may be nonessential for some clients and that a more ethical choice may be to transition to telehealth delivery of essential ABA services. We believe that a decision model that provides additional considerations may therefore be useful. The crisis decision model outlined in the current article provides a structured approach to aiding behavior analysts in assessing when to maintain direct in-person support and the conditions under which risk may be mitigated by designating a caregiver to function as the necessary essential support worker. This represents a subtle but necessary shift in verbiage to ensure that ABA providers are not redefining established terms in response to a crisis but are instead adjusting assessment and clinical programming procedures to protect continuity of care in the face of decreased essential worker resources.",

Rodriguez provides several valuable contributions to the available related research, including structured tools for modifying clinical programming to maintain telehealth-based ABA treatment integrity during a crisis. The recent articles by Cox et al. (in press) and Rodriguez (in press) provide useful information for practitioners transitioning to telehealth, including specific steps for risk assessment and clinical programming. However, there is limited available guidance on how to effectively and efficiently determine individualized needs for ongoing direct essential worker support. The current article adds a multilevel decision model for ABA service provision during a crisis. All three publications support the need for structured telehealth feasibility assessments (for both providers and consumers). Taken together, we hope that practitioners transitioning to telehealth are now better equipped to engage in subtle and complex decision making regarding assessment and treatment recommendations during the current COVID-19 crisis.",
