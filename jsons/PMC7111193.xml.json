            "text": "The spike protein of bovine coronavirus (BCV) encodes a 151 kDa protein. With its 19 potential glycosylation sites, the S protein has a size of 190 kDa when fully glycosylated [17], [18]. BCV spike protein consists of two subunits, N-terminal S1 (110 kDa) and C-terminal S2 (100 kDa). S1, which forms the bulb portion of the spike, contains domains responsible for viral attachment to the receptor of host cells, while S2, anchoring the spike into the envelope, possesses regions essential for fusion between the virus and cell membrane during infection [19]. Structural analysis predicts that peptides (ISGINASVVNIQKEIDRLNEVAKNLNESLIDLQEL) derived from the SARS-CoV S2 protein might inhibit virus-induced membrane fusion, thereby blocking SARS-CoV infection [20]. Coincidentally, our SP6 (DVDLGDISGINASVVNIQKEIDR, a.a. 1145\u20131167) partially covers the above peptide. Peptide SP6-induced polyclonal antibody was adequate for Western blot analysis but did not render a good result for immunofluorescence assay. Instead, polyclonal antibodies against peptide SP1 and SP4 (a.a. 18\u201338 and a.a. 435\u2013454, respectively) detected the SARS-CoV fixed on the biochip. Interestingly, the region between a.a. 417 and 547 of the HCoV-229E spike protein was found to be essential for binding to the hAPN receptor for HcoV-229E [10]. Whether SP4 peptide binds to the unknown receptor for SARS-CoV spike protein and may thus neutralize the virus requires further investigation.",

            "text": "In 20 patients who recovered from SARS-CoV infection, IgG antibodies were detectable after week 3 and remained at high levels for at least three months. IgM titers peaked during the acute or early convalescent phase and then declined, disappearing by the end of week 12 [21]. Lin et al. successfully raised one peptide-induced polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. IgG antibody against this N1 peptide was detectable in the sera of patients with SARS [22]. Our preliminary results showed that those high levels of IgG were largely antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (data not shown), suggesting an intriguing role for the nucleocapsid in the primary humoral immune response against SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Three groups of coronaviruses have been identified to date, although sequence conservation of nucleocapsid proteins within the genus is low. For instance, the nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses IBV (group III) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, group I) have only 29% identity with that of bovine coronavirus (BcoV, group II). Within the group II coronaviruses, the N proteins of MHV and BcoV have 70% identity [23]. The subcellular localizations of infectious avian bronchitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nucleocapsid protein in both cytoplasm and nucleolus have been described [24], [25]. The nucleolus is a structure within the nucleus that is only present during interphase. It is the site where rRNA is synthesized and processed. Biogenesis of pre-ribosomal subunits and polymerase III transcripts also takes place in the nucleolus [26]. One possible explanation for the entry of nucleocapsid protein into the nucleolus is that coronaviruses need to control host ribosomes to produce thousands of viral RNA copies. Over-expression of coronavirus nucleocapsid protein appeared to induce a cell cycle arrest, most likely in the G2/M phase [24], indicating that nucleocapsid protein may interact with unknown cytoplasmic and nucleolar proteins and delay the cell cycle progression. Interestingly, however, our study shows that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells, and nucleocapsid-transfected 293T and Vero cells, but not in the nucleolus. This suggests that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein may interact with cytoplasmic proteins rather than nucleolar proteins to localize at certain organelles in the cytoplasm. It is possible, then, that the biological function of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein is totally different from those in other coronaviruses. This unusual localization and behavior of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein may have contributed in some way to the severity of the recent outbreak of SARS.",
