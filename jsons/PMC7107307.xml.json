            "text": "Hydropericardium syndrome (HPS), prevalent in commercial chicken farms in China since mid-2015, causes high mortality in diseased chickens resulting in tremendous economic losses to poultry farmers (Li et al., 2016; Niu et al., 2016; Ruan et al., 2018). Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the causative agent of HPS (Lobanov et al., 2000; Schachner et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016). At present, HPS is distinguished by accumulation of a clear, straw-colored fluid in the pericardial sac as well as acute and hemorrhagic hepatitis (Lobanov et al., 2000; Schachner et al., 2014). The majority of previous studies have thus focused on the pathogenesis of FAdV-4 in heart and liver (Niu et al., 2018a,b). In the poultry industry, co-infections with FAdVs and other pathogens are detected regularly (Ojkic et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2012; Kaj\u00e1n et al., 2013). However, limited evidence on the immunosuppressive activity of FAdV-4 in chickens is available in the literature. In natural HPS cases, necrosis of lymphocytes has been observed in chicken immune organs. In the current study, we conducted a detailed examination of the dynamic morphology and damage mechanisms with a view to determining the effects of FAdV-4 on immune organs.",

Apoptosis is a physiological and pathological phenomenon. Excessive apoptosis can lead to physical dysfunction. Infection with pathogenic viruses can lead to activation of the apoptotic machinery in infected cells (Levine, 2005; Radke et al., 2014). Viruses additionally use apoptosis to escape antiviral host activity and maintain survival and replication (Zhong et al., 2012; Pruijssers et al., 2013). Viral infections are recognized initially via Rig-I-like or Toll-like receptors (Kawai and Akira, 2008). Signaling through these receptors elicits the release of numerous cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 (Manicassamy and Pulendran, 2009), which, in turn, triggers an inflammatory response that recruits antiviral cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes (Barlan et al., 2011). However, excessive inflammation can also damage the tissue.",

Real-time qPCR oligonucleotide primers for inflammation and apoptosis-related genes and \u03b2-actin were designed using Primer 6.0 software (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/), based on the published GenBank sequences (Table 1; Niu et al., 2018a). qPCR was performed using the UltraSYBR Mixture (High ROX) (CWBIO, Beijing, China) and the ABI StepOne System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). qPCR was conducted in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL, and the amplification steps consisted of 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by dissociation curve analysis. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Data were calculated based on the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method. Relative mRNA expression was normalized to that of \u03b2-actin.",

The results indicated that the FAdV-4 strain triggered depletion of lymphocytes and growth impairment in thymus and bursa. Interestingly, spleen\u2013body weight and wet-dry weight ratios in spleen of the FAdV-4 group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Necrosis of lymphocytes in the cortex of spleen was observed at 3 to 5 dpi. Theoretically, the spleen is rich in blood and congestion is often observed under conditions of heart failure (Mebius and Kraal, 2005). Therefore, formation of pericardial effusion is speculated to splenic congestion, and the organ index consequently becomes larger. Viral loads were consistent in the lymphoid organs but remained high in spleen. Further investigations focusing on viral location in these organs should aid in determining the level of damage.",

Along with histopathological changes to lymphoid organs, FAdV-4 infection caused suppression of the humoral immune response. The mechanisms underlying adenovirus-mediated lymphoid organ damage were further investigated using TUNEL and apoptotic gene transcription analyses. Lymphocyte apoptosis in lymphoid organs was evident at 5 dpi (Figure 4). Further evidence of apoptosis was obtained based on expression patterns of apoptosis-associated genes (Bax, Bcl2, P53, and Caspase-3) (Nkpaa et al., 2018). As expected, Caspase-3 mRNA was significantly upregulated at 4 to 5 dpi in 3 organs. Caspase proteins play important roles in the decisive stage of apoptosis (Belmokhtar et al., 2011). In the majority of apoptosis-inducing processes, transcriptional levels of caspases are significantly increased. Caspase-3 is an important effector molecule in the caspase cascade activation that, once activated, triggers characteristic apoptotic changes in cells (Green, 1998; Thomberry and Littlewood, 1998; Rogers et al., 2017). In our experiments, pro-apoptotic Bax and P53 genes were significantly increased at different time points in the 3 lymphoid organs (Wei et al., 2016). Interestingly, Bcl2, an inhibitor of apoptotic genes, was also upregulated at 3, 4, and 3 dpi in thymus, spleen, and brusa, respectively. However, Bax and Bcl-2 combine to form a heterodimer, which leads to loss of the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on apoptosis (Qin et al., 2015; Kvansakul et al., 2017). Preliminary data suggested that FAdV-4 induced lymphocyte apoptosis, which would promote lymph organ damage. However, the specific apoptotic pathways and mechanisms remain to be elucidated.",

Western blot analyses to assess protein expression should be conducted to further support these findings. However, commercial poultry antibodies were not easily available and ELISA kits were not sufficiently sensitive in detecting specific cytokine contents in poultry tissue. Therefore, mRNA measurement presents a good alternative to detect transcriptional levels in the absence of available poultry antibodies. These cytokines are considered the most important signaling molecules in the induction and regulation of the inflammatory response (Laurent et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2009; Sanchez et al., 2011). Increased transcription of inflammatory factors promotes inflammation, further inducing accumulation of various inflammatory cells and release of several soluble inflammatory regulators, reactive oxygen species, lipid regulators, proteases and cytokines, and subsequent tissue damage (Bhargava et al., 2013; Mirantes et al., 2014; Pourgholaminejad et al., 2016).",
