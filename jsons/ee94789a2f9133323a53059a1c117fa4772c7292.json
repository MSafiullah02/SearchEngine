Overweight and obesity could promote skin inflammation through the increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interlukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 by hypertrophied adipocytes (7, 8) . At the same time, psoriasis and HS can also lead to a reduced participation in social, recreational and physical activity due to the high impact of visible skin lesions on quality of life, thus favouring weight gain (7) . Hence, chronic skin inflammatory diseases and metabolic factors (overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome) are strictly linked so that a multidisciplinary is mandatory for their treatment with prevention strategies being a key public health issue.",

Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks with government and policy authorities taking aggressive isolation or restriction measures (limit traveler mobility, quarantines and border restrictions, etc). In particular, Italy is currently one of the most COVID-19 involved country in the world with Italian government imposing quarantine for all citizens, limiting the possibility to perform physical activity (gyms, swimming pools, and other sports related structures will be close up to 3 April 2020). Indubitably, limiting physical activity with most people spending the whole day at home is likely to lead to an increase in body weight as well as in calories intake. Indeed, isolation at home may share some analogue restriction aspects with another forced condition of restriction such as the prison. A recent study investigated prisoners' weight and waist circumference, showing that the obesity prevalence rate increased 50% from baseline (before imprisonment) (16%) to the 6-month follow-up (24%) (10) .",

We believe that this is particularly true for these diseases since moderate-to-severe forms are commonly treated with biologics. In a significant percentage of the cases the treatment will be interrupted for different reasons such as fear of SARS-CoV-2 risk infections consequent to their immunemodulating action, impossibility to seek dermatologists for the previously scheduled visits, delayed biologic scheme administration which could also favour the genesis of anti-drug antibodies limiting biologics efficacy.",
