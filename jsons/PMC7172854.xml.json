            "text": "On December 31, 2019, the China office of World Health Organization (WHO) was notified regarding some cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City of Hubei province. It was subsequently termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The rapid global spread of the disease led to the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (Organization, 2020). Being a global hub with high international traffic, Singapore observed an increasing spread of COVID-19. Accordingly, the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) alert level was escalated to orange on February 7, 2020, which indicates that the outbreak is deemed to have moderate to high public health impact, necessitating additional measures like quarantine and temperature screening to minimize risk of further virus transmission in the community (S K. Singapore raises cornavirus outbreak alert to orange: What does it mean, 2020, SK CA-L, 2020). Similarly, being a densely populated country, the Indian authorities imposed a lockdown on March 24, 2020, which involved barring of all public transport and prohibiting opening of public spaces (The Times of India, 2020). Between February 19 to April 17, 2020, Singapore reported slightly over 5000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 11 deaths, while India has reported >13,000 confirmed cases with >400 deaths (The Times of India, 2020, Ministry of Health Singapore, 2019). Much uncertainty revolved around the nature of spread of COVID-19, its severity, associated mortality and the availability of essential resources like facial masks, hand sanitizers and digital thermometers. Widespread fear of imposed quarantine and lockdown measures led to the unusual displays of panic in the form of frenzied buying of goods by the general public observed in many countries (Coronavirus: Hong Kong shoppers snap up rice and noodles as fears over outbreak mount, 2020, 'It's pandemonium': virus panic-buying hits Los Angeles, 2020, T A.

Such psychosomatic symptoms have been reported with increased prevalence during and after the outbreaks, such as the SARS and Ebola virus (Lam et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2005, Marco et al., 2015, Matua and Wal, 2015, Tucker, xxxx, Xiang et al., 2020). The commonly reported symptoms range from more specific symptoms like pain(Lam et al., 2009) to non-specific ones like fatigue, weakness and lethargy (Leow et al., 2005). In some cases, symptoms not perceived to be directly related to a particular infectious disease may be reported. For instance, some survivors of SARS outbreak developed chronic extra-pulmonary symptoms during outpatient clinical follow-up (Leow et al., 2005). It is important to understand the prevalence and patterns of such somatic manifestations since they can lead to undesirable overcrowding of hospital emergency departments (Farr, 2020, Abelson, 2020), causing additional workload to the already constrained healthcare systems. We investigate the association between various physical symptoms and psychological distress amongst healthcare workers in Singapore and India during the current COVID-19 outbreak.",

Cut-off scores of > 9, >7 and > 14 represent a positive screen of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively.

Therefore, when healthcare workers develop any such symptoms, they often faced the dilemma of whether to apply for medical leave of absence, or to continue working alongside their over-worked colleagues during this critical period. Even though healthcare workers are entitled to take paid sick leave for a given number of days, little is known about the employment risks posed, especially to the low-paid non-medically trained healthcare contract workers in the event of a prolonged absence. Psychological distress levels may also be exacerbated by the fear of being a carrier of the virus, causing transmission amongst fellow healthcare workers and their own families if they choose to continue to work. The fear of transmission is especially high due to the reports of asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, including high transmission rates amongst healthcare workers during in China where as many as 3000 healthcare workers contracted the infection and 22 of them succumbed (Adams and Walls, 2020). Such prevailing and overwhelming thoughts in the current pandemic atmosphere often have adverse psychological sequelae and may lead to various somatic symptoms (Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020).",

This is in sharp contrast to a low prevalence of moderate to severe psychological impact in our study (3.8% compared to 58% reported in the Chinese study). Furthermore, compared to the Chinese study population, our cohort had lower prevalence rates of moderate to severe depression (5.3% versus 16.5%), anxiety (8.7% versus 28.8%) and stress levels (2.2% versus 8.1%). However, despite our lower prevalence rates of emotional distress, our study population displayed higher prevalence rates of physical symptoms such as headache (32.3% versus 9.7%) and sore throat (33.6% versus 11.5%) when compared to the Chinese cohort. The true association of physical symptoms and psychological stress is indeed challenging to determine, especially in the current climate where the active infection needs to be urgently excluded in every suspected case before giving much importance to the \u2018non-specific\u2019 symptoms. Nevertheless, somatic symptoms may be more prevalent during periods of stress and these are hypothesized to represent a way of communicating emotions (Basant et al., 2014). We hypothesize that the increased prevalence of self-reported physical symptoms is likely to have been contributed by the psychological impact of the outbreak. Another possible contributing factor could be the social stigma associated with mental health issues, which may have resulted in individuals having a higher tendency to express their psychological distress via physical symptoms instead (Yl, 2007).",

A recent study on headache associated with personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that 81% of respondents reported PPE associated headaches, with a pre-existing primary headache diagnosis reported as an independent predictor for PPE associated headaches (Ong et al., 2020). Similarly, migraine was the most commonly reported comorbidity in our study. Hence, the common presenting complaint of headache may be related to the increased adverse psychological impact or an exacerbation of their pre-existing condition. Notably in prior studies, fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom among SARS survivors in both healthcare workers and the general public.(Lam et al., 2009) Interestingly, even in our study, lethargy was one of the most commonly reported symptom amongst healthcare workers. In a previous study from Hong Kong, Lam et al demonstrated that the prevalence of chronic fatigue was significantly higher among SARS survivors which persisted through the acute phase of infection till one month after the disease outbreak (Lam et al., 2009). Interestingly, healthcare workers infected by SARS were more likely to give up their employment, and the occupational risks faced by the healthcare workers during an epidemic may potentially lead to psychiatric morbidity, physical symptoms such as fatigue, and eventually burnout. Although fatigue and headache may be vague and often unsubstantiated, it is crucial not to neglect such physical symptoms as they may be a reflection of underlying psychological distress (Lam et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The association of psychological distress and physical symptoms is poorly understood. In addition to the fear of transmitting the infection to colleagues and family members coupled with the dilemma of applying for sick leave in an already strained healthcare sector, many healthcare workers develop burnout and may experience a sense of intense fear, stigmatization and ostracism when displaying physical symptoms suggestive of the virus infection, which often leads to negative psychological pain (Nezlek et al., 2012, Troyer et al., 2020). This phenomenon has already been described in the studies during the current COVID-19 outbreak (Wang et al., 2020a) as well as previous Ebola crisis (Matua and Van Der, 2015). We postulate a bi-directional complex relationship between psychological distress and physical symptoms, where an inadvertent psychological distress exacerbates physical symptoms and vice versa (Fig. 3\n). Accordingly, the physical symptoms related to high levels of arousal in a stressful environment of a disease outbreak may lead to over-reporting of cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms (McFarlane et al., 1994). Furthermore, a known stressor may precipitate or worsen specific physical symptoms. For example, a previous study has reported increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms seen in fire-fighters suffering from PTSD as a result of the psychological stress of smoke inhalation (McFarlane et al., 1994). We believe that various symptoms of throat pain, cough and myalgia during the current COVID-19 outbreak may be over-represented as a result of the psychological stress, and further exacerbated by the presence of various comorbidities (McFarlane et al., 1994). This observation is also commonly evident in patients with depression, with the somatization of back pain and headache (von Knorring et al., 1983). This is in line with our finding of the significant association of the presence of comorbidities and physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers.",

Secondly, we did not assess if study participants had taken medical leave of absence, or if they sought the testing for COVID-19 during the manifestation of physical symptoms. Thirdly, owing to the stringent hospital infection control protocols to minimize contact between healthcare workers, the questionnaire had to be self-administered and information provided on symptoms was not verified by a medical professional.

There is a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological distress, which is probably bi-directional. We recommend the provision for timely psychological support and interventions for healthcare workers who present with physical symptoms once an infection has been excluded.",
