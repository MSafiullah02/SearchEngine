The children were classified in two main diagnosis categories: lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other diagnoses not mentioned in the statistics included tonsillitis, gastroenteritis and fever. LRTI was diagnosed in the presence of dyspnea, signs of lower airway obstruction (wheezing, retractions) and/or a positive radiogram (infiltrates, atelectasis, air trapping). URTI was diagnosed when rhinitis, pharyngitis and/or otitis media was present in the absence of signs of LRTI.",

All PCRs were real-time assays based on TaqMan probes. The target for the HBoV-PCR was the NP-1-gene. Selections of primers and probe were based the sequences published by Allander et al. (2005). (Forward primer: CCA CGT GAC GAA GAT GAG CTC, reverse primer TAG GTG GCT GAT TGG GTG TTC, probe CCG AGC CTC TCT CCC CAC TGT GTC G, 5\u20326-FAM, 3\u2032 TAMRA.) The amount of virus in each sample was recorded semiquantitatively based on the C\nt-value (cycle threshold value) and grouped in three categories (high, medium and low viral load). The break points were set to C\nt 28 and C\nt 35. HBoV was recorded as the dominating virus in a sample when the C\nt-value was at least three cycles lower than the C\nt-value for any other virus.",

In the total material (n\n = 376) HBoV was detected in all seven samples containing four viruses, and in half of the samples containing three viruses. Similar figures were found for enterovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43. In contrast, this tendency was not demonstrable for RS-virus and influenza A-virus. Long-time shedding of HBoV, enterovirus, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus is a possible explanation. When a single sample can contain as many as four or more viruses it becomes difficult to evaluate the clinical significance of each virus. One way to solve this problem may be to quantify the individual viral nucleic acids. Quantitative analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirates is methodologically difficult because the quality of the specimens obtained varies from person to person depending on sampling technique and the condition of the patients\u2019 nasal mucosa. An exact quantitation may consequently give misleading results. We have therefore chosen to do a semiquantitive analysis and roughly group the results in three categories. Our results indicate that this approach can be fruitful. In samples with a high load of HBoV few other viruses were detected. This indicates that assessment of viral load may be of clinical relevance, but a prospective study including clinical data and a control group is needed for this question to be fully addressed.",

We found a higher proportion of LRTI in the patients where HBoV was the only or the dominating virus, indicating a tendency to cause lower respiratory tract infections.",

This was not done systematically, and many patients were discharged before the samples could be obtained. We detected HBoV in serum from four patients, all of whom had a high viral load. HBoV was detected in urine from two of these patients. This indicates that HBoV gives a viremia during acute infection and that shedding through urine can happen. HBoV was found in feces from two patients. One of them had gastroenteritis. In the fecal sample from this patient rotavirus was also detected giving a probable explanation for the gastroenteritis. In a recent study HBoV was proposed as a cause of gastroenteritis (Vicente et al., 2007). We therefore examined 101 fecal samples from unselected patients of all age groups with gastroenteritis. Only one specimen was positive for HBoV. This was a 1-year-old boy who also tested positive for rotavirus. Furthermore, he had a respiratory illness four weeks before the gastroenteritis. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that HBoV can cause gastroenteritis.",
