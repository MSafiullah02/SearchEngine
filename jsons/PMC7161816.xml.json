In late 2002 and early 2003, an outbreak of a mysterious flu\u2010like disease occurred in Guangdong Province in China. The first deaths occurred in November, yet China did not transmit information about the outbreak of \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 until February. The World Health Organization (WHO), the body responsible for protecting global public health, issued the first of a series of alerts, advisories, and updates on 12 March 2003, four months after the disease first appeared. By the time of WHO\u2019s first announcement, though, the virus had spread well beyond China\u2019s borders. Three days later, the WHO took the unusual step of advising travellers to avoid all but essential travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province. This second announcement also brought the unwelcome news that \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 was an entirely new disease, to which WHO assigned the name SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), rather than a fresh outbreak of an existing disease. In 96 updates published between mid\u2010March and July, the WHO tracked the disease, worked to determine its cause and create tests and treatments, issued new travel advisories and updated existing ones, and announced procedures to prevent transmission, more or less as would be expected in response to a serious international public health emergency. On 5 July 2003, the WHO announced that the epidemic was over. SARS had ultimately spread to 30 countries, infected over 8,400 people and killed about 10 per cent of them.1\n",

Attempts to induce timely transmission of reliable information ultimately led to a global treaty, the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, subsequently replaced by the 1969 International Health Regulations, the core instantiation of the negotiated information order of global public health governance at the time of the 2002\u20133 SARS epidemic. The SARS response can be read as a stunning global public health governance success: very shortly after receiving reports of the disease, the WHO proactively sought out additional information, developed definitions to guide identification of cases, helped orchestrate the laboratory work that quickly identified the new coronavirus, and determined how best to interrupt transmission and halt the epidemic. But SARS also can be read as a tragic failure of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and global public health governance: had information been transmitted up the chain more quickly and more honestly or had the WHO made more effective use of the information that it acquired through unofficial channels, SARS might not have spread beyond China, transmission chains could have been interrupted sooner, and mortality and morbidity correspondingly reduced. What the WHO did not know \u2013 or did not know definitively \u2013 was deeply consequential.",

Yet scholars, including psychologists, sociologists, organization theorists, and economists have focused disproportionately on knowledge and information rather than on ignorance, an oversight whose importance has been articulated in a compelling body of work on various forms of ignorance, including secrecy and non\u2010knowledge, usually taken to mean well\u2010defined ignorance (Gross and McGoey 2015: 4) or a type of knowledge about the unknown (Gross 2007: 746). To be sure, influential research has considered such important matters as the distinctions between levels and kinds of ignorance, uncertainty, and risk, strategies for handling asymmetric information, and procedures for coping with dishonesty and duplicity (see, e.g., Ackerlof 1970; Arrow 1963; Cook 2001; Ericson and Doyle 2004; Goffman 1969; Granovetter 1985; Heimer 1985b; Knight 1971[1921]; Shapiro 2005; Williamson 1975). What is missing, though, is a thorough incorporation of various forms of ignorance, such as non\u2010knowledge, into existing theories of how people, groups, and organizations seek, assign meaning to, and use information (Gross and McGoey 2015; Heimer 2012; McGoey 2014). Researchers need to consider how exactly non\u2010knowledge fits into the negotiated information orders that anchor organizational and inter\u2010organizational action.",

Information may be in short supply because it is suppressed, and it may also be of uncertain quality because it is incomplete or purposefully misleading. In effect, the SARS case suggests, whether information is acquired from legitimate sources shapes not only the nature and quality of the information itself but also the uses to which it can be put. In addition to seeking information, then, actors strategically seek information from particular sources and deploy the information they have in hand to pressure others to augment or confirm existing information. Through information leveraging, technically sufficient information becomes socially sufficient information. In this way, the article shows what a negotiated information order might look like when we more fully incorporate the social uses of non\u2010knowledge and other forms of ignorance into our analysis. In particular, the article suggests that it is especially information categorized initially as non\u2010knowledge \u2013 including suppressed data, rumour, unverified evidence, and unofficial information \u2013 that creates pressure for the renegotiation of information orders.",

Since the pioneering work of Herbert Simon (March and Simon 1958; Simon 1947), organization theorists have understood that the model of rational decision making was a poor description of reality and did not capture how information is actually used by organizations. Because of limited cognitive and computational capacities, theorists suggest, organizations are only boundedly rational, accepting satisfactory solutions rather than continuing decision\u2010making processes until they find optimal ones.",

For instance, information intensive solutions often are produced somewhat independently of the problems with which they are eventually matched (Feldman 1989). Employing the metaphor of a garbage can, other scholars suggest that organizational decision making is not linear, but instead depends on how the semi\u2010autonomous streams of choice points, problems, solutions, and participants come together (Cohen et al. 1972; Heimer and Stinchcombe 1999). Moreover, information has symbolic as well as instrumental uses, often serving to legitimate decisions even when it plays little role in identifying problems and selecting or crafting solutions (Feldman and March 1981).",

Decisions may depend less on whether decision makers have enough high\u2010quality information than on whether they agree that the available information meets a variety of normatively or even legally established criteria. That is, whether or not information is technically sufficient, it must also be socially sufficient to be usable in decision making (Heimer 1985a). Information is technically sufficient if it can be used to answer key questions confronting an organization and if it can be used, perhaps with some modification, in an organization\u2019s decision\u2010making algorithms. If decision makers cannot cite data of the sort conventionally used or recognized by their organizational field as sufficient for decision making, their decisions may be subject to challenge. A negotiated information order emerges when consensus is reached within or between organizations in a field regarding the criteria for socially sufficient information \u2013 about the type of information usable in decision making, the priority given to different types of information, and allocation of responsibility for gathering and interpreting that information (Heimer 1985a: 397).",

In particular, such symbolic considerations shape assessments of both decision\u2010making processes and the information on which they are based. To work its symbolic magic, information must be seen as legitimate, and organizational actors will spar over whose data passes that test. But, crucially, such tests are layered. Socially sufficient information is thus information that is widely agreed to be adequate to its intended purposes. Technically sufficient information is more contested, with some actors touting its virtues and others casting doubt. Technical sufficiency can therefore be a way\u2010station along the path to social sufficiency or an intermediate category that permits some uses of information while prohibiting others. Although participants experience these discussions as realist, social scientists would be quick to point out the deeply constructionist character of claims about the quality and veracity of information. The lines dividing categories of information are necessarily fluid, with discoveries shoring up some claims while undermining others and regularly adding to the stores of both knowledge and ignorance. As we will see, it is especially the boundary between knowledge and non\u2010knowledge where contests are focused, because crossing that boundary makes otherwise prohibited actions possible. Transposed into an organizational register, the dividing line between knowledge and non\u2010knowledge takes the form of a distinction between technically and socially sufficient information.",

Norms about the sufficiency of information may be grounded in rules or laws. Or they may reflect a broad, but informal consensus. What consensus is ultimately reached will depend on such factors as power differences, inter\u2010organizational dependencies, and pre\u2010existing loyalties. The preferences of powerful actors who have a vested interest in perpetuating practices associated with traditional types of information may have an outsized influence on the norms that emerge. Previous agreements about the acceptability of various kinds and quantities of information provide important starting points, but will be less influential when decision makers face situations that seem unprecedented. Thus negotiated information orders can be destabilized by modifications in technology, by the arrival of new problems or opportunities, or by changes in relationships among parties.",

Clarke\u2019s Mission Improbable (1999) shows how information orders negotiated by powerful actors can exclude other voices that might challenge the meaning assigned to information. Analysing organizations\u2019 plans to avert, control or cope with disasters, Clarke considered the \u2018fantasy plans\u2019 created to clean up oil spills in open waters, evacuate Long Island in the event of a nuclear power plant accident, and protect the population during and after a nuclear war. In each case, rather than frankly acknowledging the impossibility of averting, controlling or mitigating disaster, key actors developed elaborate analogies and conducted careful simulations to convince themselves and others of the truth of essentially untenable propositions.",

But when discussion is confined to a circle of experts, others may be unable to point out the obvious. Here, the negotiated information order precluded consideration of information that other parties could have introduced by dismissing suppressed perspectives as unusable non\u2010knowledge. With SARS, as we will see, the first impulse of health workers, scientists, and policy makers was also to assume that they were seeing a variant of something they had encountered in the past \u2013 an atypical pneumonia or a disease caused by chlamydia (Normile 2013; WHO 2003a).

In Last Best Gifts, Healy (2006) asks how the major organizations supplying blood and blood products to American patients responded to early evidence that HIV could be transmitted through their products. In the American blood industry, a non\u2010profit whole\u2010blood sector (the blood banks), reliant on donors, coexists with a for\u2010profit plasma industry (the plasma fractionators) that purchases plasma from suppliers. Between 1981 and 1983, when no one was sure whether HIV could be transmitted through tainted blood and blood products, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) presented their accumulating evidence and made recommendations about how to keep blood supplies safe (Healy 2006: 99\u2013100). Representatives of blood banks and plasma fractionators received identical information, often at the same meetings. Interestingly, though, these two sectors interpreted the information differently and adopted divergent strategies. Blood banks, dependent on donors, saw blood borne transmission as \u2018still unproven\u2019 (Healy 2006: 101) and were unwilling to ask intrusive questions about donor lifestyles and sexual practices. In contrast, plasma fractionators, working in a competitive market that made them more dependent on consumers than suppliers, adopted a policy of questioning potential donors and excluding putatively high\u2010risk groups from their supplier pools. In short, the negotiated information order of the plasma fractionators led them to see the early information about HIV transmission as knowledge to be acted on, while blood banks\u2019 information order constructed the same information as non\u2010knowledge to be ignored. With SARS, people in different social contexts not only interpreted the data differently but also concluded that the data implied different things about their obligations under the ostensibly clear rules of the IHR.",

Contrasting the insurance of mobile rigs used for exploration and drilling with the insurance of fixed platforms used later for the production of oil in the Norwegian North Sea, Heimer (1985a) shows how Norwegian insurers gradually altered the negotiated information order dominated by powerful British marine insurers. During the crucial early period of the exploration and development of the oil fields, insurers lacked the experience\u2010based information needed for rating and underwriting, making them dependent on the reinsurance offered by British insurers. Because multiple companies had to cooperate to assemble these insurance contracts with their uncertain risks and astronomical face values, insurers had to agree about what information was acceptable for rating and underwriting. British insurers stubbornly insisted on using conventional types of information. Some types of information that, from a Norwegian perspective, addressed key uncertainties thus could not be used simply because they had not been used in the past; social sufficiency dominated (alleged) technical sufficiency because of the requirement for consensus.",

They worked around and then modified conventions about what information could be used for ratemaking and underwriting. And gradually the situation changed. For mobile rigs, experience\u2010based data slowly became available and pooling risks over time and over similar units became increasingly feasible. This in turn further decreased dependence on the British reinsurance market and enabled Norwegian insurers to be more flexible about what data to use and how to construct the policies. In contrast, little changed in the insurance arrangements for fixed installations, which were more expensive, less uniform, less numerous, and introduced later in the development of the oil fields. In the SARS case as well, as we will see, pressure to change the rules became acute when new sources of helpful information became available but could not be efficiently exploited unless rules and norms were modified.",

Negotiated information orders spell out the relationships among different categories of knowledge and non\u2010knowledge \u2013 what is known, acknowledged to be known, supplied by official sources, categorized as socially sufficient and therefore available for use versus what might be known, with varying degrees of uncertainty, but cannot be acknowledged or officially used. Non\u2010knowledge, which often comes from unofficial, back\u2010channel sources, may be disregarded because it seems dangerous, threatening, harmful, or simply uncertain; ignored because decision makers are reluctant to bear the costs of retooling to collect, evaluate, and use new forms of information; or discarded because of the symbolic importance attached to information from official sources and the rights accorded to those who possess such high\u2010value information. Negotiated information orders thus introduce a modicum of stability in information use for some period of time until a new opportunity or danger arises. When that occurs, key actors pointing to the strategic value of certain information may successfully advocate for the reclassification of some non\u2010knowledge as usable and technically sufficient and for the renegotiation of the information order. The arrival of a new disease \u2013 HIV, for the negotiated information order of the American blood industry; SARS, for the IHR, the corresponding information order of global public health governance \u2013 can bring into sharp relief the irrationalities of established understandings about the reliability of information and the appropriate ways of using it.",

I have also drawn extensively on existing journalistic and scholarly accounts chronicling and analysing various features of the epidemic and scholarly articles and books investigating the epidemic\u2019s legal ramifications and the 2005 revision of the IHR. These documents were drawn from a larger body of primary and secondary materials collected primarily in 2014\u201315 for a larger project examining the relationship between law and globalization in healthcare more generally.

Only with transparency, the argument went, was there any hope of protecting public health and curbing the spread of disease.

Infectious diseases that plagued only poor countries, such as polio, were not listed, and South\u2013South contagion was a secondary concern.

Two key drivers of change have been innovations in information technologies, which vastly increased the amount of information available while simultaneously reducing state control of information, and the creation of new types of actors in the loosely organized global public health system. As reporting rules were first being developed, it was diplomats who certified that a ship\u2019s last port of call was disease free, allowing ships to avoid quarantine as they entered ports to offload cargo and passengers (Fidler 2004: 27). Although diplomats no longer verify bills of health, the treaty\u2019s reliance on national reporters remains a core element of the reporting framework even though the new categories of actors (NGOs, INGOs, international health workers, laboratory workers, scientists, etc.) have access to much relevant information. Thus an evolving information order peopled with these new actors co\u2010existed with a static legal framework that only recently acknowledged and incorporated them. This meant that the WHO was unable to act even when it possessed information that it believed to be technically sufficient. Because it was bound by a strictly formalized set of rules (few things are more rigid than a treaty with a long list of signatories), it could not adjust to evolving communication patterns.",

An especially important deficiency was the limited coverage of the IHR, which cast doubt on the legitimacy of the treaty. Beyond this severely limited coverage, the IHR were also compromised as an information order by a na\u00efve conception of states as unitary actors and by rules that allowed the WHO to use only limited kinds of information supplied by specified, state\u2010based actors. Over time, informal norms supported fuller reporting on a broader range of threats and exploitation of information from unofficial as well as official sources.

Yet closer examination of the record (see especially Huang 2004) suggests that something considerably more complex occurred \u2013 there were multiple legitimate reasons for China to conceal early evidence of the outbreak. To begin, during the first days, there was nothing to report because no one understood that this was a new viral disease. Because most apparently new diseases are in fact not new, physicians are reminded to think of horses not zebras when they hear hoof beats. As perhaps happened with SARS, this advice sometimes leads people astray. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to conclude that Chinese health workers should have been more diligent in forwarding reports about early cases of \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019. But we must be careful not to interpret actions taken in the confusion of the earliest days with knowledge acquired only later. Still, local hospitals did call on provincial authorities for help. Provincial authorities contacted the national ministry of health. A group of experts conducted an investigation. A report was prepared and circulated to all of the hospitals in the province. But here Chinese law altered the disease\u2019s trajectory because the report became a state secret that could be shared only with specified people (such as the heads of hospitals). And then the trajectory was modified serendipitously when the report arrived in hospitals during the Chinese New Year celebrations.

Under these emerging norms, a failure to report a new disease, an environmental disaster, or some other occurrence that might affect global public health was a serious infraction (Heymann 2006). Indeed, it was the conflict between these emerging norms and the existing treaty provisions, along with the emergence of new infectious diseases like Ebola, that helped spur the 2005 IHR revision, first called for in a 1995 resolution, well ahead of the SARS outbreak.7 An important difference between formal treaty obligations and norms, though, is that the first applies uniformly and the second does not. Being a signatory to a treaty is a bright line. Membership in a moral community is more ambiguous, with some treaty signatories more fully incorporated and others more peripheral. Thus although the long silence of the Chinese government was not technically a violation of the IHR, it nevertheless appeared dishonest and inappropriate to the international community, undermining rather than supporting emerging cooperative norms and in fact harming global public health by allowing the new disease to spread beyond China\u2019s borders.",

The economic effects of SARS include much more than the cost of providing medical care for those affected, as analysts acknowledge. Lee and McKibben (2004) estimated the short\u2010term impact of SARS to be about $40 billion for 2003 alone if people expected the epidemic to be a one\u2010time event and considerably higher if they behaved as if they anticipated recurrences. Subsequent research suggests that the economic impacts were considerably smaller than anticipated and that recovery occurred quickly (Keogh\u2010Brown and Smith 2008). Although the economic impact was widely dispersed, the losses were greater in Asian countries than in the rest of the world, with strong shocks to mainland China, which experienced a decline in foreign investment, and especially to Hong Kong whose service economy depends on travel and tourism.

Such discrepancies between global, collective interests and regional, state or local interests will continue to exist and some evidence suggests both continued and fresh strategies for gaming and non\u2010compliance (Scales 2010: 59\u201386).

The gap itself will not vanish. States will remain relevant actors \u2013 indeed world politics suggests that national borders are as often reinforced as demolished and that states continue to have responsibilities and interests that might motivate them to conceal information. Moreover, a clarification of treaty obligations and the introduction of a new lever for the WHO will not entirely resolve the problem. In the past, with no uncertainty about obligations to report, countries nevertheless failed to report outbreaks (Carvalho and Zacher 2001; Fidler 2004: 35; Kamradt\u2010Scott 2015: 102\u20135; Scales 2010). Although the WHO can more nimbly alert the world about an outbreak, it can do little beyond that: no sanctions, no fines, no cancellation of membership.

But under a regime that protects intellectual property and gives those supplying samples no share of the income from the sale of resulting vaccines, countries now have an incentive not to offer their samples for the common good. When Indonesia, responding to this incentive structure, began withholding flu samples, a new WHO working group developed a non\u2010binding framework to encourage both virus and benefit sharing (Fidler 2008; Fidler and Gostin 2011; Scales 2010; Smith 2014).",

But particular features of the disease, namely its brief incubation period and moderate transmissibility, meant that the adage that microbes do not respect national borders was all too applicable. Local outbreaks of SARS had global relevance in a way that local outbreaks of HIV/AIDS, with its long period of dormancy, did not. SARS quickly became a global threat. But it also mattered that the disease arose in a country that wished to suppress information about the outbreak. In the age of the internet and cell phones, information, like microbes, neither respects borders nor governmental edicts on secrecy. Thus SARS brought to a head a long\u2010standing clash between national governments\u2019 desires to keep secrets and new capacities to transmit information with or without governments\u2019 blessing. In Fidler\u2019s view, \u2018China\u2019s behavior [at the start of the SARS epidemic] put the final nail in the coffin of basing global surveillance for infectious diseases only on government information\u2019 (2004: 135) as the 1969 rules required. SARS was a \u2018historic moment in public health governance\u2019 (Fidler 2004: 186), the tipping point for new governance strategies (Fidler 2004: 187).9 In a limited sense, then, SARS was a boon to the WHO because it provided an added inducement for the WHA and member states to modify the rules in ways that benefited the entire group and gave the WHO and IHR new relevance.",

The 2005 revisions of the IHR attempted to deal with two kinds of ignorance: ignorance about outbreaks of known diseases and ignorance about newly emerging diseases and other threats to public health. Before revision, the IHR had focused only on outbreaks of known diseases and therefore on ignorance that could in principle be reduced or even eliminated by full and honest disclosure. As it became clear that infectious diseases were not going to be eradicated, as new diseases continued to emerge, and as natural disasters, industrial accidents, air and water pollution, and so forth came to be understood as threats to public health, the IHR\u2019s focus shifted to these less tractable forms of ignorance and thinking changed about what should be reportable under the IHR. This expanded understanding of threats to public health brought both expanded obligations for states and expanded obligations for the WHO. The WHO\u2019s remit now included not just spreading the word and issuing advisories about a larger package of threats to public health, but also overseeing and orchestrating the scientific work of untangling the etiology, symptom patterns, modes of detection, and effective remedies for these threats.",

But the loosening of constraints on the sourcing of information did more than simply make information usable by recategorizing previously unofficial, socially insufficient information. The modified procedures also opened the door to using information as leverage, with information of inferior quality or illegitimate provenance being used to pry loose information of better quality or from official sources. Moreover, in casting a wider net and exhibiting its willingness to draw on an expanded network of informants and more variable kinds of information, the 2005 IHR seem to acknowledge the essential irreducibility of ignorance. When uncertainty cannot be eliminated, and when the transmission and withholding of information is at least in part a strategic game, an entity such as the WHO is in no position to sharply limit the information it will consider. The 2005 IHR, a renegotiated global public health information order, thus incorporate into their structure an acknowledgement of the complex relationship between knowledge and ignorance, socially sufficient information and technically sufficient information, and the socially constructed nature of these distinctions.",

The story of the 2002\u20133 SARS epidemic, the core empirical component of the article, is about the possibility that a virulent new disease would become a devastating pandemic and about an emerging (but not yet formalized) obligation to inform the WHO about serious threats to public health. The comparison points \u2013 the threat of AIDS contamination in banked blood (Healy 2006); threats from oil spills, nuclear power accidents, and nuclear war (Clarke 1999); and threats from accidents on North Sea oil rigs and platforms (Heimer 1985a) \u2013 are also about how key actors assessed novel risks. In all of these cases, the assessment of the core risk was implicitly balanced against other risks \u2013 risks to trade and tourism for SARS; risks to relationships with important constituencies for the blood banks (Healy 2006); risks to desired investments in business and government enterprises (Clarke 1999); and risks to vested interests in the insurance business (Heimer 1985a). Generally speaking, though, as discussions unfolded, only some of the risks were fully on the table, perhaps because people were not wholly aware of how other considerations were shaping their thinking, perhaps because of the questionable legitimacy of balancing other risks (trade and tourism, in the SARS case) against threats to life and health.",

As noted earlier in the article, many disease outbreaks, even of the three reportable diseases, had not been reported to the WHO. Somewhat like the normalization of deviance that Diane Vaughan (1996) so carefully describes in The Challenger Launch Decision, the deviant non\u2010reporting of disease outbreaks had been normalized. Some countries \u2013 especially poorer ones \u2013 were learning from one another that they would suffer no consequences from ignoring IHR treaty obligations. Although the IHR were described as regulations to protect health in all countries, in fact they focused on stemming the spread of disease from poor countries to richer ones. As Chorev (2012a) suggests, international obligations perceived as coercive are more likely to be reinterpreted locally and perhaps ultimately transformed through processes of reactive diffusion. In the case of the IHR, reactive diffusion essentially made the already unenforceable IHR progressively less useful.",

Some countries \u2013 especially the richer ones \u2013 were adopting a more cooperative stance, sharing information not only on IHR reportable diseases but also on other infectious diseases and threats to public health. It was this cooperative norm, not the norm of non\u2010reporting, that ultimately diffused and, coupled with the SARS epidemic, led to a reinvention of the IHR as a treaty with a few more teeth.",

Although NASA carried out rigorous, carefully scripted pre\u2010launch reviews, contextual pressures to launch could subtly shift thinking about which risks could be dismissed and which warning signs ignored. Over time, these modified assessments were institutionalized and the insularity of the process made it hard for alternative viewpoints to force a recalibration. The conflict between protecting against rare events and attending to business is utterly mundane (Vaughan 1996), so mundane that insurers have institutionalized methods for protecting key risk management tasks from production pressures (Heimer 1985b). The job of the IHR, arguably, is to rebalance risk assessments so global public health interests are not regularly sacrificed when discrediting information about health threats is concealed to protect a country\u2019s trade and tourism. Yet the 1969 IHR treaty gave the WHO few levers to induce such a rebalancing.",

Even with China\u2019s strict control over the internet and the press, text messages and emails spread news about \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019, forcing public officials to acknowledge the outbreak. Although any single medium might fail to pick up the news, the proliferation of methods for detecting signals makes suppression of information more difficult.

Information technologies first reshaped some practices of the WHO. As the WHO began to use the unofficial information supplied by entities like GPHIN, it also initiated the process of redefining non\u2010knowledge as technically sufficient, at least for some purposes. As the WHO rebuilt its routines to use unofficial information alongside official country reports, new relationships and resources (e.g., GOARN) were created around those new information sources.10 Both the suppliers of information and the WHO increasingly treated this new information as technically sufficient. With the endorsement of the WHA, these new practices and new definitions of the adequacy of unofficial information were further institutionalized, moving one step further to a formal change in the treaty itself. With the adoption of the 2005 IHR, the process was complete \u2013 what had previously been categorized as unusable non\u2010knowledge was first reconceptualized as technically sufficient, and ultimately accepted as socially sufficient for use in an expanded menu of actions.",
