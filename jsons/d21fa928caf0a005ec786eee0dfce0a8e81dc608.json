The 2011 Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force recommended that expected duration of critical care be incorporated into resource allocation algorithms. We aimed to determine whether currently available pediatric illness severity scores can predict duration of critical care resource use. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Seattle Children's Hospital. Patients: PICU patients admitted 2016-2018 for greater than or equal to 12 hours (n = 3,206). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We developed logistic and linear regression models in two-thirds of the cohort to predict need for and duration of PICU resources based on Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and serial Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 scores. We tested the predictive accuracy of the models with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (need for each resource) and R 2 (duration of use) in a validation cohort of the remaining one of three of the sample and among patients admitted during one-third of the sample and among patients admitted during surges of respiratory illness. Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score calculated 12 hours postadmission had higher predictive accuracy than either Pediatric Risk of Mortality or Pediatric Index of Mortality scores. Models incorporating 12-hour Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, age, Pediatric Overall Performance Category, Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category, chronic mechanical ventilation, and postoperative status had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.8831 for need for any PICU resource (positive predictive value 80.2%, negative predictive value 85.9%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.9157 for mechanical ventilation (positive predictive value 85.7%, negative predictive value 89.2%) within 7 days of admission. Models accurately predicted greater than or equal to 24 hours of any resource use for 78.9% of patients and greater than or equal to 24 hours of ventilation for 83.1%. Model fit and accuracy improved for prediction of resource use within 3 days of admission, and was lower for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, vasoactive infusions, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and length of stay. Conclusions: A model incorporating 12-hour Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score performed well in estimating how long patients may require PICU resources, especially mechanical ventilation. A pediatric disaster triage algorithm that includes both likelihood for survival and for requiring critical care resources could minimize subjectivity in resource allocation decision-making.

Although \"first-come first-served\" and lottery system approaches have also been proposed to allocate limited resources, these do not target resources at patients who would benefit the most and could result in excess mortality (1, 14) . In a model of a pandemic, overall pediatric survival was greater when triage thresholds based on probability of death and duration of ventilation were used compared with a first-come first-served approach (15) .

Accuracy was even higher in the subset of patients admitted during weeks with a high proportion of viral respiratory illnesses, suggesting that the models might perform well during a respiratory pandemic. Our modeling suggests that the PELOD score may be the best of the existing pediatric illness severity scores to incorporate into a resource-allocation algorithm that accounts for both likelihood of survival and expected duration of critical care resource use. Even without considering survival as an outcome in this study, the predicted duration for total resource use, mechanical ventilation, and LOS all peaked at a PELOD score in the high teens and then fell, likely reflecting early mortality for patients with the highest PELOD scores.",

Expansion into a larger cohort at other institutions is an essential next step in developing a final algorithm for use in pediatric disasters. Inclusion of cardiac and neonatal ICU patients will also be necessary to account for all ICU resources needed throughout a hospital. We limited covariates to those available in VPS, but predictive accuracy may be increased with inclusion of additional factors such as preexisting comorbidities or medical complexity, prior admission data, or prehospital resuscitation received. Additionally, we developed models using an a priori-determined systematic process for addition of covariates and variable transformation, but a machine-learning approach may allow more precise model development by allowing an algorithm to test all possible variable combinations to determine the best-fitting model. Finally, use of existing scores limits the flexibility of the models and limited our evaluation of the PIM and PRISM scores to their standard time of calculation at 1 and 12 hours postadmission, respectively; a modified score less reliant on laboratory values may have more utility in prehospital or emergency department settings.",

Implementation would also have to be considered in the greater context of regional resources, disproportionately affected populations, and in close collaboration with public health departments, regional healthcare partners, and healthcare coalitions rather than on an individual hospital or provider basis.",

No standard pediatric scoring system has yet been implemented for crisis standards of care, and special attention must be given to not overly rely on scoring systems to make decisions prematurely. We remain cautious about the utility of any score, while understanding that there could be a point when a score-based algorithm does become necessary to create an objective and transparent system for resource allocation, especially in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and limited critical care resource availability. A multidisciplinary and multimodal approach will be essential to develop an ethically sound and widely accepted triage tool appropriate for clinical use.",
