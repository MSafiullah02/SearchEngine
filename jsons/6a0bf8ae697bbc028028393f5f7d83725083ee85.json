Of high relevance is a 2020 published study (just prior to COVID-19) that surveyed 4000 scientists in the UK and found that half of them had struggled with depression or anxiety (Abbott 2020) . High stress and low morale were prevalent in laboratories (Holleman, Cofta-Woerpel et al. 2015) , where long hours, bullying and harassment, institutional metrics have forced many to the brink of depression (Woolston 2019 ). With the current shut-down of non COVID-19 research laboratories, PhD students, junior researchers to principal investigators all face the added stress of having to ingeniously keep their projects afloat from home, while circumventing administrative and legal minefields associated with maintaining laboratories on lockdown.",

For the PhD students and post-doctoral fellows working on non COVID-19 projects and who had to cull the animals models or destroy precious lines that have been painstakingly generated and primed to be analysed during this period, the impact on these young minds can be potentially devastating. One can only imagine the mental resilience needed to maintain focus on solving that equally important mystery in oncology, cardiology, neuroscience, or any other field that has been put on temporary hold due to the pandemic. Both groups however will eventually need to face the even greater challenge of entering into the post-COVID19 era, as it is anticipated that return to normality will not be just a simple \"on-off\" switch. There will be restrictions such as staggered working hours, inability to physically exchange material, delays in manuscript publications, and many other stressors will undoubtedly affect the mental health of all researchers. Ironically, more research will need to be done on how these new stressors affect the already stressed out researchers.",
