            "text": "Bioaerosol formation in the respiratory tract most commonly occurs, upon inspiration and expiration, as a consequence of momentum transfer from air flowing through the lungs to the ALF. This momentum transfer results in wave-like disturbances that can lead to droplet creation \u2013 similar to aerosol formation from the surface of a wind-stirred sea [19]. Theoretical predictions [11] and experiments with mucus-like film [20] suggest that a critical airspeed that initiates wave disturbances in the lungs is required and it will vary according to several parameters, such as film thickness and the surface and bulk physical properties of the mucus layer. During a forceful cough airspeeds as high as 200 m/s can be attained [21]. A potential mechanism for droplet creation during calm breathing relates to the reopening of closed small airways upon deep exhalations (Scheuch, G., personal communication). In general, droplet creation results from surface disturbances in a manner similar to Rayleigh capillary instability [22], this has been carefully studied in the colloid-science literature [23] and, therefore, it is understood that droplet creation will be strongly influenced by the surface and bulk rheological properties of the lung surfactant fluid.",

Early researchers assumed the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth and throat) was the primary location of droplet formation [24, 25, 26]. In these early studies, the mouths and throats of volunteers were coated with a dye and breathing, talking, sneezing and coughing maneuvers were monitored and any resulting droplets were collected directly onto a slide. Only droplets >1 \u03bcm were measured by microscopic observation. Duguid [24] found that droplets (>1 \u03bcm) produced by speaking, coughing and sneezing were sufficiently small enough to remain airborne. Normal breathing, however, produced no measurable droplets (>1 \u03bcm). In a second series of experiments [25], Duguid determined that coughing produced an average droplet size of 14 \u03bcm. Although Loudon and Roberts [26] found that coughing produced a droplet concentration that was an order of magnitude smaller than that reported by Duguid, they found a similar average droplet size (12 \u03bcm). Another interesting common finding from these studies was the high variability in the levels of bioaerosol production from different individuals.",

Edwards\u2019 results also showed that expired particle numbers vary substantially from subject to subject, with two distinct populations: low producers (those exhaling an average of <500 droplets per liter over a six hour measurement period) and super producers (those exhaling an average of >500 droplets per liter over a six hour measurement period) of expired bioaerosols (Figure 2\n). Remarkably, the super producers (six people from this test group) expired 99% of the total amount of bioaerosols that were expired by the entire group, indicating that, if infected by an airborne pathogen, these individuals could possibly be more prone to spreading airborne disease (although the implications of airborne disease transmission was not investigated).",

Expired bioaerosol droplets range in size (from several nanometers to many microns) and undergo evaporation as a function of ambient conditions encountered after expiration. Larger droplets tend to reach the environment as a consequence of coughing and sneezing and are prone to drop on to surfaces near the source, whereas smaller droplets tend to reach the environment as a consequence of normal breathing and, by virtue of their low inertia, travel further on average than those produced by coughing and sneezing. Similar conclusions might be expected with respect to factors that influence aerosol transport regarding the trajectories of bioaerosol droplets from the upper airways to the deep lung, although this phenomenon does not appear to have been studied experimentally.",

            "text": "The airborne spread of infectious disease occurs because respiratory aerosols naturally carry pathogens, resident in the lung fluid, from the site of droplet creation to the site of droplet deposition, whether this is to another location within the lungs or to a location outside the lungs. Respiratory aerosols spread airborne infectious disease within infected individuals and between the infected individuals and their environment. However, limited work has been done that quantifies and, to some extent, qualifies this phenomenon. Among unresolved issues are: the distribution of airborne viruses and/or bacteria within expired bioaerosol droplets; the lifetimes of airborne pathogens as a function of droplet size, distance traveled and environmental conditions; and the general threat of airborne infection as a function of droplet size and pathogen type. It might be anticipated that small viral pathogens, such as influenza, will travel readily within the lungs and between individuals and their environment in small droplet nuclei; whereas bacteria, such as tuberculosis (TB), will travel more readily in larger droplets. However, this remains to be proven because even TB bacteria have been reported in small droplet nuclei by Fennelly et al. [29], they recently found that TB patients generated TB-laden bioaerosols <5 \u03bcm in diameter during coughing (with considerable patient-to-patient variability).",

Ventilation dilutes the concentration of droplets in the air by removing the circulating droplets via air exchange. With perfect mixing, 63% of airborne droplets can be removed by each air exchange [31]. However, because perfect mixing is rarely achieved, a range of droplets (20\u201360%) are typically removed from the circulation in ventilated buildings. With an adequate air exchange rate, ventilation can significantly decrease, although not completely eliminate, the number of pathogenic bioaerosols in the air [32]. Despite this, ventilation can be cost prohibitive, especially in developing countries, and is limited by comfort factors, such as noise and draft levels.",

All of these methods need routine maintenance and, thus, knowledgeable personnel to be available. These factors make the current control methods too costly or impractical to be implemented effectively; this is especially true in developing countries where resources are scarce. In addition, these strategies rely on trapping airborne pathogenic bioaerosols before they can enter a new host, relying on the expectation that pathogens will be in the environment for some time. Therefore, the possibility of preventing pathogen output at the source with an inexpensive, easy-to-administer aerosol would be an appealing solution.",

By contrast, the authors found that delivering a combination of lung surfactants within \u223c1 g of isotonic saline amplifies the size of expired bioaerosols relative to the baseline (air inhalation only). In vitro results, obtained using a simulated cough machine, indicated that a mucus mimetic nebulized with saline produces a larger droplet size after the forced convection of air over its surface than when air is forced over the mucus mimetic alone (i.e. without saline nebulization). These results led Edwards and co-workers to conclude that saline delivered onto lung surfactant increases its surface tension, and potentially other dynamic physical properties of the lung surfactant, thereby changing the droplet breakup dynamics.",

Wells et al. [40] found that adding solute to culture media before artificial aerosolization can alter the size of respired particles and change their infectiousness for test animals. 68 rabbits were subjected to breathing approximately equal numbers of tubercle bacilli in either fine or coarse (2\u201315 \u03bcm diameter range) aerosols. \u223c16 times fewer tubercles were detected in their lungs if they inhaled the larger particles [18]. Presumably, larger particles did not reach the vulnerable alveoli, affecting the mouth or the resistant mucosa of the large airways instead. Conceivably, if it is possible to alter the physical properties of the ALF in humans safely in such a way that small respiratory droplets would become harder to generate or, if generated, less likely to evaporate into droplet nuclei, airborne transmission might be reduced. This approach would probably be applicable for reducing transmission for every respiratory infection with airborne potential.",

Increasing the surface tension of the ALF might be one mechanism for increasing the inertia of bioaerosol particles and lowering the mobility of respiratory aerosols. Similarly, bulk rheological properties, such as viscosity or viscoelasticity, tend to produce larger droplet sizes after breakup because they dynamically resist the breakup process with an intensity that increases with diminishing droplet size. Increasing viscosity and viscoelasticity can provide another mechanism for diminishing the mobility of bioaerosols by resisting their formation in the ALF. Surface rheological properties, such as surface viscosity and elasticity, are additional properties that can significantly alter droplet breakup dynamics. This is particularly true for very small droplets (of micron and submicron sizes) formed in the lungs. Surface rheological properties can dominate bulk rheological properties. This is caused by the relative force of surface to bulk rheological properties in relation to the inverse of the curvature radius of deformed surfaces. Standard values of surface rheological properties tend to produce surface rheological forces that are much larger than bulk rheological forces, reflected in large \u2018Boussinesq\u2019 and \u2018Marangoni\u2019 dimensionless numbers [41]. Thus, another method for diminishing the mobility of respiratory aerosols formed in the lungs is to increase surface viscosity and elasticity.",

They can be produced by sneezing, coughing, talking and normal breathing. It appears that a minor percentage of the population will be responsible for disseminating the majority of the exhaled bioaerosol burden. Intervention with a simple aerosol approach acts as a stabilizer on the surface of the ALF and can suppress the formation of bioaerosols of pulmonary origin. This approach could provide an appealing way to mitigate the spread of airborne infectious disease in environments ranging from hospitals and clinics to homes and confined environments (e.g. prisons) where the spread of airborne infectious disease is a recognized problem. Practically, intervention might involve the inhalation of a saline-based aerosol, \u223c1\u20134 times per day, via an inhaler system that delivers the required dose of saline rapidly. The individuals taking the saline therapy and the rest of the general public should benefit because immobilizing bioaerosols in the lungs could lead to less airborne movement of the pathogen to the deep lung and/or out into the environment, allowing natural clearance mechanisms (e.g. mucociliary clearance) to remove the pathogen via the pharynx. However, it remains to be proved that the immobilization of pulmonary bioaerosols leads to a noticeably lower risk of airborne pathogen spread within individuals and/or to the uninfected public; experimental studies are required in animals and humans infected with influenza, tuberculosis and other airborne pathogens to clearly elucidate the potential for this new approach to controlling airborne infectious disease.",
