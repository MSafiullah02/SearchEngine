However, the vast majority of these cases were directly or indirectly linked to traveling or residing in the Middle East.2 There is no vaccine against MERS\u2010CoV, and current recommendations advise people to only adhere to general preventive measures such as handwashing, frequently disinfecting touched surfaces, and avoiding personal contact with infected populations.2\n",

Two in vitro studies suggested a possible efficacious effect of interferon alpha\u20102b and ribavirin in the treatment of MERS infection.10, 11 Consequently, the investigators further examined the efficacy of these drugs in an animal study.12 Potential benefits of these antiviral treatments in both in vitro and animal studies persuaded clinicians to question the feasibility and applicability of such an approach in humans. Therefore, we aimed to recapitulate the evidence from all human published data about MERS clinical management in a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis, to summarize the efficacy and safety of current applied therapeutics and define risk factors associated with outcomes. As a result, we may provide a better approach to more compatible management of fatal consequences of MERS infections and the risk imposed by recent outbreaks in densely populated areas.",

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I\n2 statistic16, 17 and assumed to be influential when I\n2 was greater than 50% or P \u2264 .1.18, 19 A fixed\u2010effect model was used because there was no evidence of heterogeneity between studies. Meta\u2010analysis was performed using data analysis and statistical software (STATA) that was developed by StataCorp. Fisher exact (or chi\u2010square, as appropriate) and Mann\u2010Whitney U tests were used for the categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The classification and regression tree (CART) model was used to identify independent variables that predict mortality outcome.20 Invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy were also chosen as the outcomes in the CART model because of direct correlation with severity and mortality.20 All possible variables were extracted to build CART (Table S4, Found in the Supporting Information). The performance parameters are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).20 Results were considered to have statistical significance if the P value was <.05. For evaluating the survival rate over time between 2 groups of all\u2010type IFN and supportive\u2010only treatment, log\u2010rank test and Kaplan\u2010Meier survival analysis were performed. We performed 2 sets of Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves. The first set described the survival time from hospital admission to death while the second set reported the survival time from onset of symptoms to death. The mean survival days was calculated for both sets. Patients who were still on admission while the original study ended were included in Kaplan\u2010Meier curves but considered as expired patients from final analysis. Data were analyzed using statistical computing and graphics (R) software version 3.3.2 developed by R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
