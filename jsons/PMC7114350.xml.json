These pressing causes exceed the (dynamic) capacity and resources of single organizations or even alliances and partnerships [53], [65]. In the private sector, well known examples of (global) interorganizational networks include clothing, aviation, car manufacturing, electronics and service [14] industries. Examples of public networking are disaster relief [70], global aviation security regulations, healthcare [34], disease control management, military (coalition-based) campaigns [2], [86], and international law enforcement. These interorganizational networks \u2013 coined as Hastily Formed Global Networks [24] \u2013 have been enabled by globalization and the advancement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) [77]. These resources do not guarantee successful performance at the network level. The multi-agent US government response to the Katrina disaster was considered unsuccessful [19], [36], as were many international relief efforts to a certain degree [23]. Other unexpected major disasters such as the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean in December 2004, and the devastating earthquake in Kashmir in October 2005 revealed the global need for a deeper understanding of network coordination in response to unexpected major disasters.",

Theoretically, our study starts, introduces and builds on the notion of instantiation. This concept distinguishes our conceptualization of networks from frequently used concepts like building and emergence in network research. Building explicitly refers to the human act of creation, and emergence connotes a result from indeterminate, evolutionary forces. By instantiation, however, we mean the evocation of available resources in an unprecedented way to achieve a common (network) goal. In this process, information sharing plays a pivotal role: representations of actors, issues, opportunities, and constraints are shared instantaneously, on a global scale, allowing network actors to adjust and fine-tune their activities [20]. We therefore call GCNs information-centric. Empirically, we analyze the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) case in order to learn how GCNs can be successful. We focus on the relationships between two countries as individual network participants (Canada and China) and the global network (World Health Organization).",

            "text": "In order to study crises many scholars have distinguished different types of crises. A general distinction can be made between natural and human-induced crises [60], [68]. Human-induced crises differ from natural crises with respect to the extent to which they can be controlled and prevented. The former are caused by human, communication and technical failures. The causes of human-induced crises are not just triggered by one event but are also closely related to the way organizations respond. Inadequate or unprepared responses may deteriorate the crisis situation. Shrivastava and Mitroff [68] therefore argue that crises are caused by two interacting sets of failures. On one hand a complex set of human, organizational and technological (HOT) factors trigger the crisis, and on the other hand organizations encounter regulatory, infrastructural and preparedness (RIP) failures. Vaughan's [78] analysis of the disaster with the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 provides an interesting example of the intricate interplay between the HOT and RIP factors. The impacts of natural crises are mostly limited to a geographic region and specific time periods. Human-induced crises may transcend geographic boundaries and even may have trans-generational impact (e.g. Chernobyl, Bhopal).",

Weick [83] points here to a unique problem of crisis situations as opportunities for a major learning strategy, trial and error, are not available. Moreover, because of their low probability, early or weak signals of crisis occurrence are often not taken seriously. Weick [84] points to the fundamental problem in creating this high-quality intelligence. He argues that action is instrumental to understanding a crisis. People enact the environment which constrains them at the same time. Only through action one learns to understand the nature of the crisis, while at the same time it affects the unfolding of the crisis itself. While most of this research deals with local, single site crises, recently the global reach and capability of pooling and disseminating information has become apparent. Media play a pivotal role in communicating crises as they shape public perceptions and responses to crises [68]. In most crisis situation, however, the quality of intelligence is put under pressure: coverage of crises by the media, individuals and groups is often fragmented. Objective data is lacking, leaving stakeholders merely with equivocal impressions [68].",

            "text": "While crisis management literature emphasizes the role of preparation for crisis situation, less attention has been paid to responses and action [60]. The ability to prepare adequately depends on the nature of the crisis situation. Preparation presumes the ability of foresight and prediction. In the case of small-scale disasters, emergency agencies can rely on protocols, network infrastructures and professional, highly trained teams ready to respond [24]. With large scale, unprecedented disasters the required response exceeds beyond the control and capabilities of one or more emergency agencies. A response organization still has to be created in the terms of a series of interlocking routines, habituated action patterns that bring the same people together around the same activities in the same time and places [85], [87]. Prediction and preparation become difficult because of low probability and the complex nature of the tasks that must be carried to control the crisis [73]. Most large scale disasters are the result of separate, small events that become linked in unpredictable ways. The more tightly activities are coupled the less linear they become [58], [68]. During the preparation phase (which in fact can be considered a \u2018phase\u2019 only after the crisis happens), most tasks are loosely formulated and ill-defined. They are directed to possibly conflicting ends, while missing unequivocal criteria for deciding when and how objectives are to be achieved. Turner [73] argues that in those situations problems are often solved by creating \u2018small areas of certainty\u2019 which can be handled. Another frequently used solution is to simplify the assumption of the complex environment, thus allowing for an oversimplified set of actions. This could lead to a situation in which crisis managers assume they control the crisis while they are in fact fighting only a small part of it. In fact, through inadequate sensemaking of the environment [84] they may even contribute the crisis spinning out of control.",

This perspective proposes situations in and conditions under which cooperation appears beneficial to actors [16], [56].

Differences in the level of preparedness at these levels might impede or obstruct GCN instantiation and consequently may cause or fail to avoid the occurrence of a collective disaster.

Considering the multi-level nature of GCNs, connection refers to vertical (between levels, usually the network orchestrator versus network actors), and lateral connections (between network participants). As Fulk et al. [28] point out, connectivity has two components. The first is the physical component which can be understood as the technological infrastructure, including people's access (e.g. Internet connection, radio, TV, mobile phones). The second is social connectivity, which refers to the trust-based relationships between the levels of the network and between network participants [28].",

Loose and tight coupling can be specified in terms of presence or absence of and interaction between joined or shared variables [35]. Both loose and tight coupling imply that the interacting actors in a network share meaning [51], in the case of crisis situations \u2013 see also [79] \u2013 on the urgency of the event conditions instantiating the network. This meaning emerges as the crisis becomes worse and interaction between the actors involved increases [74], [82]. Orton and Weick [58] distinguish two defining characteristic dimensions of organizational systems: responsiveness and distinctiveness of system elements. If there is neither responsiveness nor distinctiveness there is not really a system, and it can be defined as a non-coupled system. If there is responsiveness without distinctiveness of the elements, the system is tightly coupled. When there is distinctiveness without responsiveness, the system is decoupled. If there is both distinctiveness and responsiveness the system is loosely coupled.",

During the phase transition towards activation, these connections become, under the leadership of the network coordinator, temporarily tightly coupled.

Moreover, the SARS outbreak caused a \u2018breakdown\u2019 of the existing international and national systems and procedures for responding to epidemic diseases. From a methodological point of view, breakdowns are interesting episodes to investigate as they reveal the current nature of practices, tools and equipment, customs [90].

Code Orange is part of the Uniform Emergency Codes, which has been adopted by the Ontario Hospital Association in 1993. It indicates an external disaster, which alerts hospitals to prepare for a rapid influx of patients being brought to hospital by ambulances. The code is intended to be applied to a specific area and to be used for a limited period of time. However, it soon appeared that the Code Orange was not the appropriate response for an infectious disease outbreak such as SARS. The code paralyzed the health care system because there was in fact no extraordinary number of incoming patients, as would be the case during natural disasters. In fact, the challenge in controlling SARS was to significantly restrict access to healthcare facilities. Moreover, Code Orange was not meant for such a broad geographic area and for a sustained period of time. As a consequence, many hospitals unaffected by SARS were forced to reduce their service level significantly. They delayed current procedures and thereby put critical patients at risk.",

The SARS outbreak was no longer under control. In early February 2003, an anonymous SMS began circulating in Guangzhou (Southern China) about this new disease. The SMS message was in the end caught up by people from the WHO global influenza surveillance network. A son of a retired WHO staff member, traveling through China, sent an email to the Communicable Disease Team Leader of the WHO in China in which he reported about \u201cthe strange contagious disease which has already left more than 100 people dead in\u2026 Guangdong province, in the space of 1 week\u201d (quoted in [6: 75]). From then on the WHO started to put the Chinese government under pressure to open up and exchange information about SARS. In April 2003, the Chinese press was allowed to publish on the SARS and only then a WHO team was allowed to visit the province of Guangdong. Thereafter, the Chinese government declared the war on SARS. In spite of the lack of modern information and communication technology the government initiated a very effective campaign on fighting SARS and mobilizing the entire population. It used community structures and people's surveillance to contain the spread of SARS. On a press conference on June 24 China was declared SARS-free [6].",

The International Health Regulations (IHR) were the only set of international binding rules to which WHO member states were committed concerning the control and containment of infectious diseases. The old IHR dated from 1969, and relied on a passive, state-centric system for the reporting of three communicable diseases that could spread globally: cholera, plague and yellow fever [39]. This passive system reflected the dominance of the exclusive privilege of countries to report and respond to infectious diseases within their own territories [40]. The idea of national sovereignty of national health care systems prevented the development of a strong commitment to the IHR. WHO member states frequently violated the IHR obligations to report outbreaks of diseases, because they feared serious economic consequences as other countries reacted to the outbreaks [27]. However this non-reporting behavior directly influenced the effectiveness of the global cooperation according to the IHR.",

Discussion about this revision started in 1996 and resulted in the adoption of a new set of regulations for the proactive collection of information about infectious disease outbreaks and the development of protocols for coordinated response [39]. This new system was formally launched in 2000 and embodied in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), a network with a secretariat within the WHO that links more than 120 individual surveillance and response networks (governmental and non-governmental) across the world. GOARN is an information-centric network, supported by advanced Internet technologies [57]. This system tracks outbreaks and spreading of SARS continually. GOARN consists of experts in various areas whose knowledge must be integrated to combat major diseases. Teams on the ground in relevant countries receive information from, and provide information to WHO. These teams work together through video- and teleconferencing. In cooperation with other agencies, WHO thus orchestrates a global network for monitoring disease outbreaks and communicating about these, mainly through its website.3\nvAn essential element within the GOARN is the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). This is a sophisticated, Internet-based multilingual early-warning tool for continuously collecting epidemiological information of all kinds (such as informal and formal reports) about infectious diseases [27], [40].",

The WHO decided to set up a secure website where each research lab could post its findings. Daily teleconferences were organized to discuss the research results and to share information.

On the other hand, they had to cherish the competitive environment in which international reputed researchers were used to work in.

They responded very quickly and cooperatively while at the same time they were able to preserve their distinctiveness and competitive orientation. The labs agreed that they would exchange research data, and figure out by themselves the most efficient way to divide up the work. The very fact that the labs were working independently appeared also to be a particular strength in their search for identifying the SARS virus. This situation closely resembles the functioning of academic networks as described by Orton and Weick [58]. Loose coupled systems, like the academic networks, exhibit properties of both decoupled and tightly coupled systems [12]. The emphasis on knowledge specialization contributes to the distinctiveness of the research labs, while this specialized knowledge is only useful when it can be integrated into common knowledge base of the academic network. From a knowledge creation perspective the SARS case provides an extreme case of dynamic knowledge specialization and integration. Within only a few months new knowledge was created, shared, integrated and applied. While current studies explore processes of work division and knowledge integration in distributed teams (e.g. [33], [44], [59]), our study reconsiders these ideas for temporary networks.",

Although the WHO coordinated the network of scientific laboratories, no one dictated top down what different labs should do, what viruses or samples the researchers would work on, or how information would be exchanged [72]. The SARS GCN remained predominantly a heterarchically structured and loosely coupled network. The WHO gained legitimacy in this heterarchically structured network not by enforcing relationships, but by successfully coordinating the global response within the context of an emerging shared sense of urgency. Spurred on by what seems resolute leadership of director-general Gro Harlem Brundland, the WHO decided to pursue an open information strategy, rather independently from the continuously conflicting national governments. It invited scientists, public healthcare workers, policy makers, travelers, and citizens to collaboratively help to control and contain the spreading of SARS. In contrasts with the closed information strategy of the Chinese government during the first three months of the SARS outbreak, this open information strategy helped to leverage untapped resources and allowed people to take responsibility. The initially weak social connections between China and the global network prevented a timely alert and response.",

Comparison of the two embedded case studies on Canada and China demonstrates the relevance of distinguishing between the ability and willingness to respond [55]. Canada's ability to respond was bounded by an outdated IT-infrastructure, unconnected information flows, unclear responsibilities, a failing alert system, a lack of coordination, a weak analytical capacity of the Ontario Public Health Branch, and a lack of involvement of the federal government [92]. Irrespective of China's ability, the case study showed the unwillingness to cooperate in the GCN for SARS during the first few months of the crisis. This political aspect in crisis management is hardly addressed yet in the organizational literature on organizational crises, except for policy evaluation reports on for instance the Katrina disaster [19]. It underscores the role of culture and trust in crises response. Fidler (2004) argues that the SARS outbreak reflected the collapse of the classical regime on infectious disease control, which was dominated by the sovereignty of national health care systems. The SARS outbreak instantiated a new kind of global solidarity in the detection and validation of global infectious diseases [40]. Asian countries continue to adhere to the standards and norms that had been established during the SARS outbreak.",

            "text": "Building trust appears to be difficult in crisis situations, especially when many stakeholders are non- or decoupled to the network. The sharing of information and delegation of tasks without continuous surveillance to unknown partners turned out to be problematic. Trust relationships are not built overnight and require prior investments [8]. Moingeon and Edmondson [52] distinguish two levels of trust. The first refers to the confidence that other organizations will not abuse the information that will be exchanged. The second refers to the belief that other organizations are capable to keep up with their promises [52]. While both types of trust are important, trust in intent probes to be problematic as time shortage does not allow for establishing enduring trustworthy relationships. Hagel and Brown [38] therefore argue that when organizations operate in dynamic environments trust relationships should be mainly based on trust in competence. Jarvenpaa and Leidner [42] found that high-trust virtual teams exhibit a form of \u2018swift trust\u2019. People who have never worked together and do not expect to work again act as if trust is present from the start. Meyerson et al. [50] characterize swift trust as a form of depersonalized action which may be a by-product of a highly proactive, enthusiastic generative style of action. Although we should be cautious in generalizing conclusions from research on virtual teams to global crisis response, it might help to explain how swift trust emerges in GCNs. Our study, though, emphasizes additional factors at play such as or organizational preparedness and openness. With an increasing sense of urgency in crisis situations, decision makers will calculate the risk of non-trusting and embrace a collaborative attitude.",

Third, underlying the successful campaign to bring the spread of the corona virus under control was the instantiation of an interorganizational information network. And finally, the success of instantiating global information networks was largely determined by the contribution of individual contributors (countries) and the global coordinator of the network (WHO).",
