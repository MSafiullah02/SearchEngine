            "text": "Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are key immune cells that make up a large proportion of tissue infiltrating innate leukocytes following a pathogen challenge. Both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes-macrophages (IMMs) are rapidly recruited to the site of infection and play crucial roles in the host defense against viral lung infections [1, 2]. The antiviral functions of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are facilitated following the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the cell surface and endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) and intracellular RIG-I like (RLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs). Detection of viral PAMPs (viral proteins and nucleic acids) by these sensors leads to the activation of a cascade of signaling events resulting in the production of antiviral molecules like interferons (IFNs), interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [3\u20135]. IMMs and neutrophils also participate in the phagocytosis of virus-infected cells and orchestrate effective adaptive T cell responses, both of which are essential for effective virus clearance [6].",

            "text": "In addition to host protective function of myeloid cells during viral lung infections, several recent studies demonstrate their role in mediating cytokine storm and thus exacerbating the host immune response to virus infections [2, 7]. The deleterious functions of neutrophils and IMMs are linked to dysregulated type I IFN (IFN-I) responses, particularly during high pathogenic virus infections [8, 9]. For example, while a controlled neutrophil response is protective during influenza A virus infection, an excessive neutrophil accumulation is detrimental [10, 11]. Similarly, an exaggerated monocyte-macrophage response resulting from delayed IFN-I signaling is detrimental during human coronavirus infections [8]. IMMs and neutrophils also express increased levels of death receptors such as DR5 and FAS, and the interaction of these receptors with their ligands TRAIL and FASL, respectively, promotes airway epithelial and lung microvascular endothelial cell death [9, 12, 13]. Additionally, excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by IMMs and neutrophils impair antiviral T cell responses, leading to ineffective virus clearance and reduced survival [8].",

We recently showed spontaneous production of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by neutrophils and IMMs, which correlated with severe lung pathology and reduced survival in CoV infections [8]. Thus, the identification of specific inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by these cells will allow us to define their pro-inflammatory status and design strategies to control inflammatory responses. In this study, we describe useful markers to identify innate immune cells infiltrating into the lung and describe a simple method to evaluate inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production by neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages during pathogenic human coronavirus infections.",

            "text": "\nBoth MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV should be aliquoted in ice-cold DMEM and the media should be kept on ice throughout the period of infection.Ketamine/xylazine anesthesia gives uniform infection compared to isoflurane. It is essential to make sure that the animals are completely anesthetized. Following anesthesia mice should be placed on their back on thick bedding to avoid hypothermia.During MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, neutrophil accumulation peaks between day 1 and 3 post-infection and monocytes between day 2 and 4 post-infection. As a result, days 2\u20134 are ideal time points to assess the activation and pro-inflammatory activity of myeloid cells.Soon after harvesting, lungs should be placed in PBS on ice until further processed. Post-homogenization, the lung tissue can be digested at room temperature from 30 to 45 min.After Collagenase/DNAse digestion, the lung tissue in 15 mL conical should be kept on ice until further processed. Following tissue homogenization, all washing and cell surface staining should be carried out on the ice or at 4 \u00b0C.For efficient staining, antibodies should be diluted in 100 \u03bcL of FACS buffer and added to assigned well of 96-well round-bottom plate or tube. Both plate and tubes should be placed on flat surface of vortex machine (with very low speed) to ensure that cell pellet is broken and antibody solution is uniformly distributed.The concentration of LPS for stimulation should be 10\u2013100 ng/mL. Other TLR agonists could be used at 1 \u03bcg/mL concentration for optimum results. When adding TLR agonists and Golgi-plug, it is essential to dilute these reagents in RPMI-10 and add 100 \u03bcL (of 2\u00d7 concentration) to 100 \u03bcL of cell suspension in the 96-well round-bottom plate. Alternatively, a 200 \u03bcL of RPMI-10 media with TLR agonists and Golgi-plug (both at 1\u00d7 concentration) can be added to the wells.Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) should be carried out using anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with APC or PE or PerCPcy5.5 dyes for better results and use other dyes accordingly for cell surface staining. For ICS staining, cells should be incubated for 25\u201330 min for better results. Keep cells on ice throughout cell surface and intracellular staining.After surface staining, the cells should be treated with cytofix for 15 min followed by washing and resuspension in FACS buffer. There is no need to add cytofix to ICS-stained cells as these cells were already treated with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer immediately before ICS staining.For best results, cells should be acquired in flow cytometer within 1\u20132 days post-staining.\n",
