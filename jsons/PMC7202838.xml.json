The high risks in these countries reflect a combination of country characteristics: densely populated urban areas, high rates of self-employment with no sick pay, poor community hygiene and sanitation, and weak health systems.2 These health systems lack adequate surveillance and laboratory capacity3 and a sufficient supply of appropriately trained health workers, and have utterly insufficient critical care capacity to address the upsurge in severe COVID-19 cases4\u2014challenges that also severely hampered the response to Ebola outbreaks.5, 6 While dealing with this surge in cases, it is essential that the health systems themselves do not become a vehicle for transmission to patients or front-line health workers.",

The search strategy included terms related to infection prevention and control (\u201cinfection prevention\u201d, \u201cinfection control\u201d, \u201cIPC\u201d, or \u201chand hygiene\u201d), the clinical setting (\u201coutpatient\u201d, \u201cprimary care\u201d), and the country setting (full list of low-income and middle-income country [LMIC] names, full list of standard terms for LMIC setting). Three studies met the inclusion criteria. A study of 945 health facilities in Kenya measured health worker compliance across five domains of infection prevention and control in 2015. It found that compliance was 2\u00b73% for hand hygiene, 41\u00b70% for glove practices, 87\u00b71% for injections and blood samples, 14\u00b77% for reusable equipment, and 5\u00b74% for non-sharp waste segregation. A second study showed hand hygiene compliance of 38\u00b79% in one teaching hospital in Jamaica. Another study examining injection practices in primary care in Bangladesh showed hand hygiene compliance to be 5\u00b76%, with new syringes and needles used 84\u00b75% of the time and correctly disposed of 18\u00b75% of the time.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, this is one of very few large-scale studies to examine health worker compliance with infection prevention and control practices during outpatient care in a low-income country. In this study of 220 private for-profit and faith-based health facilities, conducted in 2018, we observed a total of 18 710 infection prevention and control indications relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 3688 provider\u2013patient interactions involving 734 different health workers. Infection prevention and control compliance was poor overall, regardless of facility level, ownership, or location. Compliance was 6\u00b79% for hand hygiene, 74\u00b78% for glove use, 4\u00b78% for disinfection of reusable equipment, and 43\u00b73% for waste management. Nurses and midwives performed better than more highly qualified health workers for hand hygiene and glove use.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe available evidence shows that compliance with infection prevention and control practices will need to improve dramatically if the health systems in east Africa are going to contain rather than fuel the transmission of COVID-19. The findings highlight the urgent need for policy makers to address very low baseline infection prevention and control compliance in health facilities. These findings should inform strategies designed to increase supplies needed for infection prevention and control and to influence the behavioural determinants of compliance with the relevant practices.\n",

            "text": "It is thought that the two main routes of transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, are through respiratory droplets and through contact. When someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 coughs or exhales, they produce infective respiratory droplets that can be inhaled by anyone close to them. In addition, droplets landing on nearby surfaces can be a source of contact transmission via the hands to the nose, mouth, and eyes.7 SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on surfaces for 4\u201372 h, depending on the surface, similar to other human coronaviruses.8, 9 Therefore, appropriate infection prevention and control in health facilities is crucial, particularly given asymptomatic transmission10, 11 and the possible increase in treatment seeking as morbidity increases. Whereas in many high-income countries the advice has been not to visit a health facility if you have fever or cough, in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), this advice might be much less appropriate given the high prevalence of other potentially serious diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria, pneumonia, HIV, and tuberculosis. Moreover, it is uncertain how well such advice would be heeded or enforced. In the context of poor infection prevention and control practices, the use of outpatient services by people with COVID-19 could lead to high rates of infection in health workers, and could fuel health-care-associated infections, which are already prevalent in LMIC settings.12\n",

Private for-profit facilities have steadily grown in number, especially in the past decade. Although the public sector remains the dominant health-care provider, the private share is sizeable: in 2019, nationally, 13% of providers were private for-profit and 12% were faith-based, while in urban areas the private shares were much higher (52% for-profit and 19% faith-based in the city of Dar es Salaam).16 Facilities are categorised by level: dispensaries (the lowest level, often staffed by a single clinical officer with 3 years of post-secondary education), health centres (larger facilities with more staff, which might admit some patients), and hospitals (which have inpatient wards and usually have a fully qualified doctor).",

Facilities were recruited from the Northern, Eastern, Central, Southern, and Southern Highlands zones. At the time of recruitment there were 462 APHFTA member facilities and 513 CSSC member facilities in the study zones. We selected a non-random list of 280 potentially eligible facilities for participation. APHFTA and CSSC approached these facilities to confirm eligibility and obtain written informed consent. Of the facilities approached, 43 were found to be ineligible or were unwilling to participate, giving a total of 237 facilities participating in the randomised controlled trial. For the current study, we used data from the endline sample. Using an endline sample from the quality-improvement programme evaluation raises the question of whether these facilities had higher infection prevention and control compliance than would normally be expected.

Using secondary data from a 2018 study, we found that, under typical circumstances in Tanzanian outpatient facilities, infection prevention and control compliance was inadequate. Of primary concern was inadequate hand hygiene, which WHO has cited as crucial for COVID-19 containment, and for which overall compliance was only 6\u00b79%. Hand hygiene was particularly rarely practised when gloves were used, indicating that there was little understanding that contamination of hands could take place despite the use of gloves.21 Compliance was also extremely low for disinfection of reusable equipment\u2014only 13% of thermometers and less than 1% of stethoscopes, items both likely to be very widely used for patients with COVID-19 symptoms, were disinfected between patients. Performance on management of (non-sharp) waste was also below 20%, which could mean that additional infection opportunities arise if hazardous waste materials are subsequently not disposed of appropriately. One might expect that infection prevention and control compliance will increase compared with these findings from 2018 as awareness of COVID-19 grows among health workers and communication campaigns are launched. However, it is also possible that compliance will worsen as facilities see far greater patient volumes, leading to greater pressure on health worker time and supplies needed for the prevention and control of infection.",

There was some evidence that compliance varied by health worker characteristics. Most notably, older health workers were less likely to use gloves correctly, female health workers were better at hand hygiene, and nurses and midwives performed substantially better than more qualified providers in most of the infection prevention and control domains. From a policy perspective, these data indicate what types of health worker could be prioritised in the design and targeting of infection prevention and control interventions.

Together with the lack of variation in compliance across facilities, this leads us to expect that public sector compliance is unlikely to be higher than the rates observed in this study. This expectation is further supported by the fact that infection prevention and control compliance in our study was slightly but consistently higher than a comparable study of outpatient care in Kenya (appendix p 3), which included public, faith-based, and for-profit facilities, and found a weak negative association between public ownership and compliance.18\n",

First, because the data were originally collected for a different purpose before the pandemic, we did not measure certain supplies or behaviours crucial for the control of COVID-19, such as the wearing of personal protective equipment required to manage suspected COVID-19 patients. Second, we do not claim that our estimates are representative of private facilities in Tanzania. The sample did not include facilities in certain regions, private for-profit hospitals, or any tertiary hospitals. Moreover, we did not select a random sample among those eligible to participate. However, the lack of variation in compliance by facility level, ownership, and location gives us reason to expect a similar pattern of results elsewhere in the country. Third, by observing infection prevention and control compliance, we might have changed provider behaviour through the Hawthorne effect. However, this measurement method is likely to be more reliable than self-reports of behaviour, and our analysis of the order number of patients observed provided no strong evidence of a Hawthorne effect, although it has been noted in other studies.20 Fourth, we used endline data from a randomised controlled trial of a quality-improvement programme. As noted above, there was no evidence of a difference in infection prevention and control compliance between intervention and control facilities, but structural quality was assessed in both study groups at baseline by study partners, and it is possible that this could have raised awareness of infection prevention and control requirements. If awareness had been raised, it would imply that the inadequate infection prevention and control compliance observed should be considered a maximum. Fifth, we did not measure item-specific availability of infrastructure and supplies needed for infection prevention and control.",

First, inadequate infection prevention and control will make health workers more likely to contract COVID-19 from their patients. Several small studies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, caused by another coronavirus, reported attack rates for SARS among health workers ranging from 1\u00b72% to 57\u00b71%.27, 28 These same health workers will be needed as front-line staff to deal with seriously ill patients as cases mount, so having significant numbers of health workers sick or self-isolating could threaten the operation of the health system at a crucial time. Second, inadequate infection prevention and control could put patients and caregivers at risk of contracting COVID-19 when they visit a health facility for another complaint. Although data on health-care-associated infections are poorly recorded in LMICs, the available evidence indicates that they are relatively common in LMIC health systems (where 15\u00b75 patients per 100 acquire an infection, compared with 7\u00b71 per 100 in Europe).12 Any such health-care-acquired infection should be avoided, but this is particularly important for COVID-19, as the case fatality rate is significantly higher for those with pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), who might be more likely to be visiting health facilities.",

            "text": "Our findings raise the question of what can be done about poor compliance. There is consensus that interventions must be based on an analysis of the causes of poor infection prevention and control in specific contexts, and that successful interventions are generally multifaceted.29 A systematic review of the WHO-5 hand hygiene campaign\u2014consisting of five components, namely system change, training and education, observation and feedback, reminders, and a safety climate\u2014found it to be effective in improving hand hygiene in hospitals, and found that compliance was further improved by adding behavioural interventions such as goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability.30 This review focused only on hand hygiene, and included studies were predominantly from intensive care units or other inpatient settings, with the vast majority in high-income countries. In weaker health systems, the availability of supplies is likely to be an important bottleneck. A recent WHO\u2013UNICEF report on water, sanitation, and hygiene in health care reported that only 74% of facilities globally had basic water services (51% in sub-Saharan Africa), and 16% of facilities had no hygiene service (ie, no hand hygiene facilities at points of care and soap and water near toilets).31 During outbreaks, when patient numbers are likely to substantially increase, maintaining supplies will be particularly important. However, even in weaker health systems, supplies are necessary but not sufficient for infection prevention and control compliance, as shown in a large study of infection prevention and control in Kenya.18 In addition to the behavioural interventions highlighted above, attention should also be given to the health-system-level determinants of poor infection prevention and control, such as leadership, management, logistics, and accountability, which merit focus in future research.",

However, prices are rising rapidly because of increased demand during COVID-19, especially for hand rub, which is unlikely to be available in sufficient quantities on the open market. WHO recommends two formulations for local production of hand rub, but countries will need support to do this on a large scale, with proper quality assessment.14\n",
