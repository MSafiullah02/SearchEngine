He received early renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury (AKI).

Methylprednisolone was continued at a maintenance dose of 60 mg bd for 4 days until the full vasculitic screen had come back negative, with fluconazole added prophylactically in view of the steroid burden. Ceftazidime and gentamicin were started empirically for rising inflammatory markers and fever on day 6 of ECMO and continued for 7 days. The patient received 8 days of ECMO support.

It can have a mortality exceeding 50% in the intensive care setting and is traditionally associated with haemoptysis, although this may be absent in a significant proportion of patients [5]. Radiological features include a non-specific diffuse infiltrative opacification pattern on chest X-ray and ground-glass opacities on CT in acute bleeding [6]. It carries a wide differential diagnosis including vasculitis, infection, drugs, acute respiratory distress syndrome and heart failure [3]. In leptospirosis, pulmonary haemorrhage has been the presenting sign preceding other clinical features [7]. In patients admitted to the ICU with undifferentiated pulmonary haemorrhage, leptospirosis should be considered even in the absence of other typical features. DAH does not always present with classical BAL findings, as was the case here. There was evidence of clotted appearances interspersed with fresh blood. This was probably related to the delay between initial presentation with haemoptysis and the BAL, which was only performed after the initiation of ECMO. By this time, some interalveolar and endobronchial clotting would have commenced. It remains speculative as to whether the classical BAL findings would have been found if BAL was performed at the referring centre at presentation or soon after intubation. However, we did not find an alternative source, and no alternative microbiology became apparent from the ECMO BAL samples.",

Our patient received two doses of 1 g methylprednisolone followed by 1 mg/kg maintenance to treat any possible underlying vasculitic process prior to the diagnosis. Ludwig et al. gave 1 g of IV prednisolone in combination with an extracorporeal cytokine absorbent filter shortly before their patient died [16]. Kutlesa and Gjurasin gave methylprednisolone for 10 days but the dose is not recorded [15]. Chaikajornwat et al. gave 250 mg methylprednisolone every 6 h for the first 2 days of their patient\u2019s admission in case of vasculitis [13]. Further trials examining the role of steroids in leptospirosis are required, but in the context of pulmonary haemorrhage without a solid diagnosis, steroids should be considered to treat possible vasculitic causes.",

A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors is crucial and if in doubt leptospirosis serology and PCR should be sent. Most patients make a full recovery with treatment, but barotrauma does seem to be associated with DAH in leptospirosis and ECMO support should be considered early to avoid harm from non-protective ventilation. There is no clear evidence for steroids in confirmed leptospirosis and their use cannot be recommended. However, they are often instituted empirically prior to diagnosis in case of vasculitic causes for pulmonary haemorrhage. Unfortunately, leptospirosis continues to cause the greatest mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries where access to ECMO is severely limited. In the future, the encouraging outcomes of patients managed with ECMO should be considered when arguing for the introduction of ECMO programmes in high-burden countries.",
