The hyperimmune sera against recombinant proteins and native antigen of the measles virus strain NovO/96 were found to be highly active in ELISA.

Measles morbidity in Russia is about 2000-3000 per year [3] . The measles virus genome is a negative single-stranded RNA of 15894 nucleotides, packaged within a helical nucleocapsid. Transcription and replication are carried out on this complex. Virion contains six structural proteins, three of which form the nucleocapsid, i.e., the nucleocapsid protein N (521 amino acids) that binds the viral RNA tightly; the phosphoprotein P (507 aa); and the large protein L (2155 aa), which, along with the P protein, represents a major component of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase [17] . Three other proteins are associated with the viral envelope, i.e., the membrane protein M (335 aa); the fusion protein F (553 aa), the disulphide-linked heterodimer of the F 1 and F 2 subunits formed after proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein F 0 ; and hemagglutinin H/Nh (617 aa) [5] .",

Three linear antigenic determinants were localized on the measles virus protein N. Among these determinants recognized by monoclonal antibodies, one is located in the N-terminal region of the protein and conservative among various isolates of measles virus, while two others situated in the C-terminal part are variable and strain-specific epitopes [15] . Using E.coli -expressed protein N deletion mutants, the conservative determinant was mapped in the 122-150 region of amino acids, while the first variable epitope was mapped in a region between amino acid 457 and 476, and the second vari-able was mapped in the 519-525 region of amino acids, respectively [7] . The presence of T-and B-cell linear determinants, along with the fact that protein N does not undergo any complex post-translational modification, enables using a prokaryotic host to produce the protein fully retaining its immunobiological activities [6, 11, 14, 19] . Protein N-specific antibodies can be detected by immunoblotting in virtually all serum samples obtained from vaccinated and reconvalescent patients [14] . Three different expression systems have been used to express recombinant measles virus nucleoprotein, including bacterial ( Escherichia coli BL21), insect cells ( Spodoptera frugiperda ; Sf9), and mammalian fibroblasts. The nucleoprotein produced in all three hosts was used in ELISA for the detection of IgG and IgM measles virus-specific antibodies [19] . The study of recombinant protein N expression in prokaryotic ( E.coli ) system revealed that only full-length intact protein N can be used as a reagent for ELISA [18] . Since the immunobiological properties of the nucleocapsid protein are thoroughly investigated, the measles virus gene N product is a strong candidate for ELISA antigen. In the present study, we attempt to obtain a composite recombinant protein possessing maximal possible immunobiological activities.",

The analysis of negative sera using the Dade Behring kit revealed optical density (OD) values of less than 0.1, while the positive sera showed OD readings of 0.48 \u00b1 0.06. The negative sera did not react with rN and rH/N recombinant proteins showing OD values of less than 0.1. The positive sera interacted with the rN protein (OD readings of 0.36 \u00b1 0.05) supporting specificity of the recombinant protein. Thus, not only the full-length polypeptide, as was shown earlier in [18] , but also its fragments containing linear antigenic determinants, can be used for producing recombinant rN protein in E. coli . Furthermore, the C-terminal 6xHis tag can be used to purify recombinant protein, whereas the use of large affinity tags like \u03b2 -galactosidase and maltose binding protein led to a loss of immunobiological activities of the recombinant protein [18] . Finally, the recombinant protein rN obtained in this work has a molecular weight 27 kDa less than that of intact protein (60 kDa) and can be used as an antigen for detecting IgG against the measles virus by ELISA.",
