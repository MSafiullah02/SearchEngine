Although it is a large and complex protein, it has nevertheless been highly conserved through evolution, indicating important physiological functions. Homologs are found even as far back as prokaryotes. Lrrk2 belongs to the Roco protein family of the Ras/GTPase superfamily (8-10). The sequential structure includes a leucine-rich repeat zone (Lrr), a Ras of complex proteins (Roc), a C-terminal of Roc (Cor) domain, and a microtubule-associated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) domain, with termination in beta propeller forming repeats (WD 40). Lrrk2 is thought to function, at least in part, as an active protein kinase (11) with mutations resulting in a gain of function (12).",

They occur in each of the functional domains. As examples, the mutations R1067Q, S1096C, I1122V, and S1228T occur in the LRR domain; whereas I1371V, R1441C, R1441G, and R1441H occur in the Roc domain; R1514Q, Y1699C, and M1869T occur in the Cor domain; R1941H, I2012T, G2019S, and I2020T occur in the MAPKKK domain; and T2356I and G2358R occur in the WD 40 domain. In addition, R793M and Q930R occur N-terminal to the functional domains. The most prominent of these substitutions is G2019S, which is common in French and North African families as well as Ashkenazi Jews (13). It also occurs in approximately 1% of unselected PD cases, 3% to 6% of familial cases (13,14), and some normals. Penetrance varies. In one study, penetrance was found to range from 17% at age 50 to 85% at age 70 (15). Most postmortem studies on patients with LRRK2 mutations have revealed the typical PD findings of nigral cell loss and extensive Lewy body distribution, but some have demonstrated Alzheimer-like neurofibrillary pathology, some multiple system atrophy-type pathology, and some progressive supranuclear palsy-like pathology.",

In the present study, we analyzed for the presence of LRRK2 mRNA in human astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia; in the human neuronal cell lines SH-SY5Y and LA-N-2 and in whole brain, liver, and heart. Using membrane-bound overlapping peptides covering the full Lrrk2 sequence, we identified the C-terminal binding site of a polyclonal anti-Lrrk2 antibody and performed an immunohistochemical analysis of a series of brains of patients with PD, including one member of a family with autosomal-dominant late-onset parkinsonism (family B) (19) as well as patients with diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), Alzheimer disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Pick disease, the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam (PDCG), and Huntington disease. We find that the LRRK2 gene is expressed in all cell types and organs studied; that the Lrrk2 protein occurs in the soluble state in normal brain; and that such pathologic entities as Lewy bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, and Pick bodies are recognized by a polyclonal antibody to Lrrk2.",

The findings will need to be confirmed using multiple antibodies on a much larger series of cases. The finding that LRRK2 mutations were also found in a few cases with AD also reinforces this possibility. This is in harmony with previous findings showing that in familial PD cases with LRRK2 mutations, heterogenic pathologic changes were observed at autopsy.
