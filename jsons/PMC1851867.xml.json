The amplified fragment was then recombined with plasmid vector pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), which contains one SalI and one NcoI fragment site.

Optimal contrast between the specific labeling and the background for each antigen was achieved using a PV9000 immunohistochemistry kit containing polyperoxidase anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). To visualize specific signals, a DAB (3,3\u2032-diamino-benzidine-tetrahydrochloride) substrate chromogen kit (Zymed Laboratories) was used. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Antibodies binding to cells of interest were detected with the horseradish peroxidase reaction kit AEC, which gives a red reaction color. For every case, double labeling with IHC and in situ hybridization was repeated three times for data analysis. To strengthen further the results of co-localization, we performed in situ hybridization and IHC on consecutive sections. Tissue sections showing in situ hybridization-positive cells were carefully compared with consecutive tissue sections on which IHC with antibodies against specific cell markers was applied. Co-localization of a specific cellular marker and viral genome was clearly identified.",

Cells positive for one specific IHC marker were counted, and cells showing both positive in situ hybridization and IHC signals (positive double labeling) were also counted. The identity of the cells showing co-localization was confirmed by performing in situ hybridization and IHC separately on consecutive sections as described above. The infection rates of each of the three cell types as identified by IHC were derived from cell counts (cells showing positive double labeling/total number of cells positive for a specific IHC marker). All evaluations were performed in a double-blinded manner. The infection rate of each of the three cell types was graded according to the following criteria: 1) cell infection rates less than 10% were regarded as grade I and were marked with +; 2) cell infection rates between 10% and 20% were regarded as grade II and were marked with ++; and 3) cell infection rates exceeding 20% were regarded as grade III and were marked with +++. The infection rates for each specific cell type and the semiquantifications of the infection rates are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Infection rates of endothelial cells and fibroblasts were not calculated because the absolute numbers of infected endothelial cells were very small and because of the lack of a specific marker for fibroblasts in general.",

In this study, we found that SARS-CoV is capable of infecting vascular endothelial cells. This may indicate that direct infection of such cells partly accounts for the observed injury of vascular endothelium. However, the paucity of infected endothelial cells seems insufficient to explain the severe vascular injury. Previous studies have reported high levels of various cytokines and chemokines in the serum of SARS patients.17,18 We therefore assume that in addition to direct viral infection, both hyperinduction of proinflammatory mediators and hypoxia may play an important role in the injury of vascular endothelium in SARS patients.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV.20,21 This receptor is expressed abundantly in tracheal epithelium, pneumocytes, and vascular endothelium but not in lymphocytes, macrophages, or fibroblasts.22 It is thus possible that SARS-CoV infects epithelial cells of the trachea, pneumocytes, and vascular endothelial cells (all expressing ACE2), through interaction of the spike protein and ACE2, and then replicates in these cells to cause intercellular transmission. However, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV infects cells that do not express ACE2 receptors is unclear. In this study, both lymphocytes and macrophages harbored viral genomic sequences and had high infection rates, despite the absence of ACE2 expression. A possible explanation is that ACE2-negative cells, such as macrophages, are infected on contact with the basolateral aspect of infected epithelial cells by direct cell-cell contact or engulfment. In measles, this kind of indirect infection has been described to account for the infection of tissue-resident macrophages and dendritic cells.23",

D: SARS-CoV genomic sequences are detected by in situ hybridization in the same CK-positive cells as shown in C (in situ hybridization signals, purplish blue; arrows, consecutive section to C). E: Double labeling with in situ hybridization and IHC detects co-localization of SARS-CoV and CK in the cytoplasm of bronchial epithelial cells (CK IHC signals, brownish red; in situ hybridization signals, dark blue; arrow). F: Lung tissue showing a large number of CK-positive cells (CK IHC signals, brownish red) with morphological features of type II pneumocytes in the alveoli. Positive in situ hybridization signals are seen in some of these cells (combined IHC and in situ hybridization signals, purplish blue; arrow) and in some round CK-negative cells (in situ hybridization signals, dark blue; arrowhead). G: Double labeling with in situ hybridization and IHC detects SARS-CoV in many CK-positive pneumocytes including type I pneumocytes (arrows) and in some round CK-negative cells (arrowhead). H: Negative control for in situ hybridization with an irrelevant probe showing no positive signals in SARS-CoV-infected lung tissue (counterstained with methyl green). Scale bars: 25 \u03bcm (A, B, E, G, H); 20 \u03bcm (C, D, F).",
