Phenotypic properties are also important, especially for clinical microbiologists. The type of hemolysis on blood agar, reaction with Lancefield grouping antisera, resistance to optochin, and bile solubility remain important for grouping of clinical Streptococcus isolates and therefore treatment options [2] . In the following chapter, two phenotypic classification groups, viridans group streptococci (VGS) and beta-hemolytic streptococci, will be discussed.",

High-level beta-lactam resistance in VGS is a real threat to the treatment of infective endocarditis and empirical treatment of sepsis in neutropenic patients. Treatment of infections, including pharyngitis, caused by macrolide-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci may also become challenging if resistance rates continue to rise.",

            "text": "Viridans group streptococci form a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of species belonging to the genus Streptococcus [1] . However, they have some common phenotypic properties. VGS are a group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci with a chaining morphology upon microscopic examination. They can be grouped as alpha-or nonhemolytic. They can be differentiated from S. pneumoniae by their resistance to optochin and lack of bile solubility, though the distinction between the two groups remains difficult due to similar sequence homology [2, 4] . They are leucine aminopeptidase positive, pyrrolidonylaryl amidase negative, and can be differentiated from Enterococcus species by their inability to grow in medium containing 6.5 % sodium chloride [2] . Nutritionally variant streptococci were once included in VGS but based on molecular data been removed to a new genus Abiotrophia [5] . VGS belong to the normal microbiota of the oral cavities and upper respiratory tracts of humans and animals. They can also be isolated from the female genital tract and all regions of the gastrointestinal tract [2, 5] . Although historically VGS are poorly classified, there are many species within the group. The six major groups include S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and S. bovis group. The S. anginosus group has been the source of much controversy and ambiguity regarding taxonomy and classification. This group of organisms can be alpha-, beta-, or nonhemolytic, and it is the isolates lacking beta-hemolysis that are generally considered to be a part of VGS. Due to the diverse nature of VGS, the rates and patterns of antimicrobial resistance vary greatly. Differences in species identification and patient population contribute to this variability [4] .",

Decreased affinity can be achieved by amino acid substitutions in the transpeptidase domain of the PBPs [24, 27] . A single point mutation can result in an increase in the penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. Normally more than one mutation is needed for intermediate level beta-lactam resistance. Highly resistant strains have accumulated several mutations in the PBPs, altering the PBPs significantly so the beta-lactams can no longer bind to the PBP. Accumulation of several mutations in the PBPs may also result in lethal mutations if cell-wall integrity is compromised. Based on the data obtained in S. pneumoniae, these highly resistant strains may also have mutations beyond those found in PBPs [24] . Streptococci have overcome this problem by horizontal transfer of functional mutated PBP coding genes or gene fragments. Transformation and subsequent homologous recombination has produced beta-lactamresistant VGS with mosaic PBP genes. In these mosaic PBP genes, there are gene regions obtained from resistant strains dispersed through the wild-type PBP genes [28] .",

These antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to bacterial ribosomes. Macrolides can be divided into different groups according to the number of carbon atoms in their lactone ring. Fourteen-and 15-membered ring macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin have similar antibiotic properties. Sixteen-membered ring macrolides including spiramycin differ from 14-and 15-membered ring macrolides in their antimicrobial activity against VGS. Lincosamides such as clindamycin and streptogramins also have some differences in their activity against bacteria when compared to macrolides. In streptococci, there are two well-characterized macrolide resistance mechanisms. These are target site modification and active drug efflux. Target site modification is mediated by methylases encoded by the erm (erythromycin ribosome methylation) genes or by mutations at the 23S ribosomal RNA or ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Methylation of adenine 2058 of the peptidyl transferase loop of 23S rRNA causes resistance to macrolides as well as to lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics [32] . The active efflux mechanism encoded by the mef (macrolide efflux) genes is more specific and causes resistance only to 14-and 15-membered ring macrolides [33] . Mutations at the macrolide binding domains of the 23S ribosomal RNA and at the ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 lower the affinity of macrolides to ribosomes [34] . Mutations can cause several different kinds of resistance phenotypes. Both erm and mef genes can be horizontally transferred between different streptococci [35] .",

These strains were characterized as highly resistant (MIC values >100 mg/L) to macrolides and lincomycin and were often resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol as well. Strains were exclusively of the T12 serotype. From 1985 to 1987, an increase from 1 % to 17.6 % in the frequency of erythromycinresistant GAS was seen in Australia's Fremantle area [83] . These strains represented different serotypes and exhibited overall low-level resistance to erythromycin (MIC range 2-8 mg/L) Resistance to clindamycin and tetracycline was rare. Sporadic isolates and family outbreaks with 22 % erythromycin-resistant GAS, predominantly of T4M4 serotype, was reported between 1988 and 1989 from Dundee area in the United Kingdom [84] . Resistance to erythromycin continues to be reported in GBS since 1962. The first description was from the United States [85] , and in the same country macrolide resistance in GBS increased from 1.2 % among isolates collected from 1980 to 1993 to 18 % in 1997 and 1987. Increasing resistance has been reported from other countries as well. In Spain, the frequency of macrolide resistance in GBS increased from 2.5-5.6 % in 1993-1996 to 14.5-18 % in 1998-2001 [86] and in Taiwan from 19 % in 1994 to 46 % in 1997 [87] . Since the end of the 1990s, frequencies of 15-21 % have been reported in France [88] [89] [90] , 13-18 % in Canada [91, 92] , 40 % in Korea [93] , and 22 % in Turkey [94] .",

            "text": "The macrolide resistance mechanism by ribosomal methylation encoded by erm genes was first identified in 1956 in Staphylococcus aureus [97] . This resistance mechanism affects macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSb) antibiotics. The inducible and constitutive forms of MLSb resistance have been found in beta-hemolytic streptococci since the early 1970s [98] [99] [100] . The erm(B) methylase gene was the only erm gene class found in streptococci [101] [102] [103] until 1998, when the sequence of erm(TR) in S. pyogenes was published [104] . Its nucleotide sequence is 82.5 % identical to staphylococcal erm(A) and 58 % identical to erm(B) and, therefore, erm(TR) belongs to erm(A) methylase gene class [105] . The inducible or constitutive production of the methylase is dependent on the sequence of the regulatory region situated upstream from the structural methylase gene. Resistance is associated to structural changes in the regulatory sequence. Exposing S. pyogenes harboring the inducible erm gene to clindamycin results in highly resistant mutants of S. pyogenes [106] . The phenotypic expression of macrolide resistance in streptococci has been commonly studied by MIC determinations and induction tests including the double-disc test (erythromycin and clindamycin disks placed in vicinity on inoculated agar). Analysis of the Finnish GAS strains isolated in 1990 revealed a new erythromycin resistance phenotype with low-or moderate-level resistance (MIC range 1-32 mg/L) to 14-and 15-membered macrolides only (M-phenotype). Thirty-four percent of the studied isolates represented the new M-phenotype [80] . Subsequently, the active efflux mechanism causing this phenotype and the encoding mef(A) and mef(E) (macrolide efflux) genes were characterized in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae [33, 107] . Isolates with this mechanism have been found among betahemolytic streptococci in different parts of the world. Countries where strains of GAS carrying mef(A) have been observed now account for the majority of macrolide-resistant isolates. These countries include Spain [108, 109] , Germany [110] , Greece [111] , Finland [112] , Taiwan [113] , the United States [114] , Chile [115] , and Argentina [116] . Predomination of GAS strains carrying erm(A) have been reported from Russia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Croatia [117, 118] . GBS isolates with MLS resistance caused by erm(B) and ermA predominate in most reports in Canada and other parts of the Western Hemisphere [92, 119] , France [88, 89, 120] , Spain [86, 121] , and Taiwan [87] In both GBS and GCS, the highest proportion of isolates carrying mef(A) have been reported from Taiwan (37 %) and Finland (95 %) [95, 96] .",

In earlier studies conjugative plasmids with erythromycin resistance determinants were found from group A, B, C, and G streptococci and were shown to transfer by conjugation between streptococcal species [130] . Transfer was also seen by transduction among VGS [131, 132] . However, most antibiotic resistance genes in streptococci are currently thought to be chromosomal in origin. Beta-hemolytic streptococci belonging to groups A, B, C, and G have been shown to transfer their chromosomal macrolide resistance determinants by conjugation [126, [133] [134] [135] . A composite chromosomal conjugative element, Tn3701, encoding resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline has been described in GAS [136] . Within this element the resistance genes are carried by a Tn916-like transposon. The presence of Tn916-Tn1545-like conjugative transposons carrying erm(B) and tet(M) has been verified, and an association of chromosomal erm(A) with tet(O) has been noted among GAS [137, 138] . An unusual chimeric genetic element containing DNA identical to Tn1207.1, a transposable element carrying mef(A) in macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, has also been found in different GAS strains. The mechanism of horizontal transfer in these strains was suggested to be transduction [139] . Furthermore, analysis of the genetic environments of the mef(A) and erm(B) genes by Southern blot experiments have indicated a remarkable heterogeneity of genetic elements carrying these genes, particularly erm(B). This suggests that different mobile elements can be recruited into the chromosomes of the circulating GAS population and that genetic rearrangement may also occur after a strain has acquired the resistance determinant [138] . Macrolide resistance mechanisms differ among streptococcal Lancefield groups and geographical area. New gene sequences demonstrating resistance continue to evolve.",

            "text": "A large variety of clones of GAS are drug resistant [113, 138, 140, 141] . Increased resistance rates may be caused by clonal spread of resistant strains and by horizontal transfer of resistance determinants among the circulating microbial population. Macrolide-resistant GAS of the same clone have been found from different countries and even different continents [140] . Same clones have been found among susceptible isolates as well, but in general the heterogeneity of GAS clones seems to be lower among resistant than susceptible isolates [138, 140, 141] . Single clones of GAS with a macrolide-resistant determinant may become predominant or cause outbreaks both regionally and nationwide [128, [142] [143] [144] . For example, in 1994, 82 % of erythromycinresistant GAS isolates collected in Finland expressed the M-phenotype. Although multiple clones were found among these isolates, increased regional resistance rates were clearly associated to T4M4 serotype with mef(A) [112, 134] . In the United States, isolates carrying mef(A) of an emm6 (M6 serotype) clone caused an epidemic among schoolchildren in 2001. In April-May of 2002, this serotype was not found in the same region when the resistance rate was high. Thirty-five percent of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, with an emm75 (M75 serotype) clone predominating [114, 143] . Cresti et al. found that a steady increase of erythromycin-resistant GAS from 9 % in 1992 to 53 % in 1997 in an area in central Italy was caused by an increase of the proportion of strains carrying inducible and constitutive erm(B) and erm(TR) determinants. These strains were of multiclonal origin. Correlation of the erythromycin-resistant GAS clones to the heterogeneity of genetic elements carrying the erm(B) indicated identical genetic environments of erm(B) in clonally unrelated strains, but on the other hand also considerable diversity of these genetic elements both among clonally unrelated and within clonally identical strains [138] . The increase of resistance includes a complex genetic interaction within circulating streptococcal population and may be between streptococci and other species [145] . Macrolide consumption, differing immunities, and other host factors of populations may also contribute to this interplay and spread of resistance determinants and resistant clones [146] [147] [148] .",

In some studies, among GBS, the frequency of clindamycin resistance exceeds that of macrolide resistance suggesting another mechanism of clindamycin resistance may exists [86, 93, 149] . In one isolate of GBS from Canada, the linB gene encoding a lincosamide-inactivating nucleotidyltransferase was found [92] . This gene has previously been identified in Enterococcus faecium. Both constitutive and inducible clindamycin resistances have increased in recent years, especially in group A and B streptococci [150] . Inducible clindamycin resistance in betahemolytic streptococci remains an under-recognized phenomenon of unknown clinical significance. Lewis et al. evaluated inducible clindamycin resistance through an animal model and retrospective patient chart review. In the animal model, inducible resistance impaired killing of beta-hemolytic streptococci and bacterial load by 48 h were similar to the control isolated that were constitutively clindamycin resistant. Eight of these cases resulted in both microbiological and clinical failure [151] . Thus, inducible and constitutive resistance should be detected during routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing.",

Clindamycin is recommended for prophylaxis for patients allergic to penicillin [66] ; however, it should be noted that use of macrolides can also select for clindamycin-resistant strains among streptococci in the normal flora. Telithromycin is very active against VGS strains in the normal microbiota.

There have been changes in the etiology of bacteremia in febrile neutropenic patients, and infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among this population. Gram-negative pathogens was historically the primary cause; however, up to 70 % of bacteremia cases in neutropenic patients are now associated with Gram-positive bacteria [170] [171] [172] [173] . Bacteremia is identified in 10-27 % of febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies, and 18-29 % of the bacteremia is caused by viridans streptococci. Possible reasons for this shift are use of prophylactic antibiotics, increased use of intravenous catheters, and aggressive chemotherapies resulting in prolonged neutropenia and mucositis [171, 172, 174, 175] . VGS are an important cause of bacteremia among neutropenic patients. One study assessed 528 episodes of bloodstream infections, 15 % of which were associated with neutropenia. Thirty-five percent of the blood stream infections were caused by Grampositive pathogens, with VGS being the most frequent causative pathogen at 22 % [176] . The proportion of VGS as a cause of bacteremia ranges between 3 % and 30 % [56, 172, 173, [177] [178] [179] . S. mitis followed by S. oralis or S. sanguis are the most commonly isolated species [173, [179] [180] [181] [182] . Bacteremia caused by VGS strains often originate from the oral mucosa [183, 184] . Predisposing factors for VGS infections are severe and prolonged neutropenia, prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, mucositis, and treatment of chemotherapyinduced gastritis with antacids or histamine type 2 antagonists [174, 182] . VGS infections can be rather asymptomatic, fever being the most common symptom [174, 181, [185] [186] [187] . Eighteen to 39 % of the patients with VGS infections develop serious complications, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or both. Viridans streptococci are currently one of the most common pathogens in both adults and children, and bacteremia caused by this bacteria can result in death in up to 20 % of patients [188] .",

Once fever is detected, risk and severity infection should be assessed in order to help guide type, venue, and duration of empirical treatment. Updated European guidelines review the importance of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenia to minimize the collateral damage associated with antibiotic overuse and the further selection of drug-resistant pathogens. The guidelines suggest that infection control procedures and new antibiotic regimens based on local epidemiology, risk factors, escalation and de-escalation approaches, duration of empiric therapy, nonconventional therapies against MDR, and other bacterial management issues are vital to optimize antibiotic choice.

For these patients, hospitalization and intravenous empirical treatment may be necessary. Preferred agents include an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, carbapenem, or piperacillintazobactam, although initiation of monotherapy with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent, such as cefepime, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or piperacillin-tazobactam, may be used. Ceftazidime monotherapy has also been shown to be effective and continues to be used at some cancer centers. However, many experts avoid ceftazidime monotherapy because of rising resistance rates among Gram-negative bacteria and its limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococci, compared with newer alternatives [169] . Glycopeptides should be avoided first-line because of limited Gram-negative coverage, and empirical addition of vancomycin did not give extra benefit when compared to piperacillin-tazobactam therapy [190] . Regardless, the addition of this agent could benefit those with suspected catheterrelated infection, skin or soft tissue infection, pneumonia, or hemodynamic instability [169] .",

This data suggests that it may not be necessary to adjust treatment guidelines between adults and children. In pediatric cancer patients, VGS strains are predominantly S. mitis and S. oralis.

Studies have shown increased mortality in patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia when vancomycin was not included in the initial empiric regimen [173] . More recently, Shelburne et al. developed a clinical prediction model for beta-lactam resistance in VGS causing bloodstream infection. The study validates use of Gram-positive spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, for empiric therapy of febrile neutropenia. Several assumptions were made including the definition of penicillin non-susceptibility, an MIC value \u22652 mg/L, increased risk of shock syndrome, and mortality. It was also assumed that vancomycin administered at onset of fever in neutropenic patients with VGS bacteremia will improve outcomes. Betalactam use in the prior 30 days, beta-lactam prophylaxis, and inpatient status at onset of febrile neutropenia correlated with a predicted MIC value \u22652 mg/L and non-susceptibility. It was determined in this one study that glycopeptides can be safely deferred until documentation of a resistant Grampositive bacterial infection is made, despite IDSA guidelines stricter criteria [193] .",

Although CF has no cure, antibiotics are a staple in the treatment and prevention of lung infections. Evidence suggests S. anginosus, among other VGS organisms, may be important pathogens in this population. Recent studies have compared resistance patterns in CF and non-CF patient populations and have shown that both penicillin-and erythromycin-resistant VGS isolates in fibrotic patients have reached 38.4 % and 87.9 %, respectively. Among CF isolates, resistance rates are increasing as patients are living longer and continuously face antibiotic exposure. Moreover, as the physiology of the lung is affected in these patients, so is drug penetration into their lungs.

It is caused by swelling in the pharynx and may be bacterial in nature. Five to 15 % of pharyngitis cases are caused by GAS [195] . Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of streptococcal infections and macrolides are considered as alternative treatment for patients allergic to penicillin. Susceptibility testing should be used to confirm treatment choice and repeated cultures should be monitored for resistance development while on therapy. Treatment eradication rates are associated with pathogen susceptibility. Specifically, studies have demonstrated the eradication rate is only 38-60 % when macrolides are used to treat macrolide-resistant strains in comparison to an eradication rate of 80-92 % when these agents are used against macrolide-susceptible organisms. [196] [197] [198] . The use of a macrolides for the treatment of macrolide-resistant GAS pharyngitis is also associated with a significantly lower clinical cure rate compared to that achieved with amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or cefaclor [198] . Again, emphasizing the importance of culture and susceptibility results in treatment selection. A recent study has also shown erm and emm 90 to be important resistance genes in invasive GAS [199] . Few resistant strains exist and the knowledge of resistance and resistance mechanisms is important. For example, use of clindamycin against an erythromycin-resistant isolate requires knowledge of the result of both the susceptibility testing and the determination of the macrolide resistance phenotype for a given isolate, because clindamycin should not be used to treat isolates with the MLSb-phenotype [106] .",

            "text": "In this review, we discussed key global resistance data, including incidence and mechanisms of resistance. Betalactam resistance is primarily mediated by point mutations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and presents clinical challenges due to its role in treatment of infective endocarditis and neutropenic fever. Common macrolide resistance genes include erm and mef. Resistance with this class of antibiotics may be responsible for a variety of infections including phar-yngitis and neonatal sepsis. Both resistance genes and mechanisms continue to evolve, and new sequences have been discovered in recent years. Antibiotic overuse, inappropriate antibiotic use, and delayed antibiotic administration are contributing factors to the rise in antibiotic resistance. Clinical studies and drug development continue to provide guidance and new treatment options; however, use of local antibiograms, implementation of infection control procedures, and antimicrobial stewardship are critical in treating patients with invasive streptococcal infections including VGS and betahemolytic streptococci.",

Daptomycin susceptibilities of the baseline clinical isolates by Etest ranged between 0.03 and 1.5 mg/L for S. mitis, 0.023-0.12 mg/L for mutans, and 0.016-0.047 mg/L for S. salivarius.
