Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared. Results Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%). According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result. Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03). Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6 (14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Conclusions Older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition. Treatments of COVID-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed.",

The new novel coronavirus was identified in samples of airway epithelial cells from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of COVID-19 [6] . After a month, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7] .

Internationally, cases have been reported in 213 countries, areas or territories [15] . At present, information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 is scarce. Taizhou is a prefecture level city of Zhejiang Province with a population of 6 million. However, Taizhou has a large number of people engaging in trade and learning in Wuhan. According to statistics alone, there were more than 20,000 people returning from Wuhan to Taizhou when the epidemic started. Therefore, Taizhou has become one of the main outbreak places of imported cases. Given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, an analysis with larger sample size cases in Taizhou is urgently warranted. Here, by collecting the data from 145 laboratory-confirmed cases, we sought to provide an up-to-date delineation of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 throughout Taizhou. The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to compare severely ill patients with non-severely ill patients.",

One patient was admitted to intensive care. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%, 22/145), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%, 14/145). The average age of severely ill patients was older than that of non-severely ill patients (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), and the body mass index (BMI) of severely ill patients was higher than non-severely ill patients (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02), but there were no significant differences in smoking history and gender between the two groups. In terms of co-morbidities, a significant high percentage of diabetes mellitus was observed in severely ill patients (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08). As expected, severely ill patients had a higher APACHE II score (median, 5 vs. 3, p < 0.01), a higher SOFA score (median, 2 vs. 1, p < 0.01) and a higher MuLBSTA score (median, 9 vs. 5, p < 0.01). In terms of epidemiology, 45.5% (66/145) of the patients were those who returned to Taizhou from or around Wuhan, 44.8% (65/145) were close contacts, and 9.7% (14/145) could not determine the source.

Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were more likely to report fever, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnea (90.7% vs. 68.6%, 60.5% vs. 35.3%, 60.5% vs. 20.6% and 7.0% vs. 0%, all p < 0.05), and the duration of fever in severely ill patients was longer (median days, 6 vs. 4, p < 0.01). The median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 6 days (IQR, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . There was no difference in signs between the two groups.",

As with previous studies [21] , there were no gender difference between severely and nonseverely ill patients in our study.

Consistent with previous studies [18, 21, 23] , our study also found that the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients decreased, and it was more obvious in severely ill patients. Severely ill patients were more likely to show prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, a higher level of troponin I, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin than non-severely ill patients. These results further confirm that pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocard injury, and hepatic injury [21] . Our study found that in the lung imaging CT of severely ill patients were mostly bilateral pulmonary lesions. This suggests that perhaps bilateral pneumonia is one of the risk factors for severely ill patients.",

Because severely ill patients are more likely to suffer from lymphopenia, intravenous immunoglobulin have been given to enhance the anti-infection defense reaction of severely Fig. 2 Ground-glass opacity and patchy and patchy high-density shadows were mainly on the left middle lobe and the lower left lobe, edges were blurred, ground-glass opacity were observed in the upper left lobe. A few fibrous high-density shadows were observed in the left lower lobe ill patients [23] . In addition, among our cohort of 145 confirmed patients with COVID-19, glucocorticoid was given to 8.8% of non-severely ill patients and 88% of severely ill patients. However, the use of glucocorticoid is still controversial. According to WHO interim guidance, glucocorticoid should not be routinely given systemically [16] . Another study has shown that clinical evidence does not support glucocorticoid treatment for COVID-19 and that no benefit was observed from glucocorticoid support [24] . However, according to the study of Jinyintan Hospital [23] , it is suggested that steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg per day) are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic glucocorticoid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients with COVID-19. 90.3% of patients have been treated with traditional Chinese medicine. In another report [25] , traditional Chinese medicine (Shufeng Jiedu Capsule) treatment has also shown a certain improvement of the clinical symptoms.",
