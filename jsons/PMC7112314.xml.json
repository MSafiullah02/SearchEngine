            "text": "Potassium (K) as quality element is one of the major nutrients for plant growth and development (Besford and Maw, 1975). It is the most abundant cation in plant cells and plays important roles in metabolisms like enzyme activities, water and assimilate transport, and protein synthesis (Yin and Vyn, 2002, Yin and Vyn, 2003, V\u00e9ry and Sentenac, 2003, Pettigrew, 2008). Different potassium supplement levels significantly affect physiological and biochemical characters of plants (Chartzoulakis et al., 2006). Appropriate potassium concentrations effectively improve plant productivity (Yurtseven et al., 2005), while its deficiency leads to a decrease in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate (Zhao et al., 2001, Gerardeaux et al., 2010), and inhibits root and shoot elongation (Drew, 1975, Bednarz et al., 1998, Shin et al., 2005, Kanai et al., 2007). Inappropriate potassium levels may also induce stress responses, and many stresses can result in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals (\u2022O2\n\u2013) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Shin and Schachtman, 2004). Plants have evolved antioxidant enzyme system including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) to prevent damage from ROS (Bowler et al., 1992, Nayyar and Chander, 2004). SOD scavenges \u2022O2\n\u2013, resulting in H2O2 and O2 formation (Amor et al., 2006). CAT and POD are the main enzymes to eliminate H2O2 (Le\u00f3n et al., 2002, Passardi et al., 2005).",

In recent years farmers are trying to increase its production by artificial cultivation. Being different from field crop plants such as cotton, wheat, maize and rice (Koch and Estes, 1975, Bednarz et al., 1998, Weng et al., 2007, Pettigrew, 2008, Gerardeaux et al., 2010), only limited information is available about its response towards fertilization formulae. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient fertilization system for its commercial cultivation. However, the effects of different potassium supplement levels on its growth and physiology are largely unknown. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to filter out the optimal supplement level of potassium for H. cordata growth by investigating its effects on growth, plant K concentrations, water contents, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis, transpiration, H2O2 contents and antioxidative enzyme activities.",

Many studies have demonstrated an obvious increment in plant stature and yield with proper supply of potassium (Mullins et al., 1994, Heckman and Kamprath, 1995, Pettigrew and Meredith, 1997, Buah et al., 2000, Vyn and Janovicek, 2001). In the present study, H. cordata plants acquired highest values of dry weight, shoot height, root length and number on 1.28 mM K, and as such represented the most favourable treatment for its growth and development. Potassium starvation, as well as its surplus, caused severe reduction in its growth and development. The length and surface area of root affected the range of nutrient absorption, having direct negative consequences on plant productivity (Cakmak, 2005, Hermans et al., 2006, Pettigrew, 2008). Therefore, the decreases in dry weight and shoot height of H. cordata were partly due to similar changes of root length and number. Moreover, although the supply of surplus potassium resulted in higher contents of foliar potassium as compared to 1.28 mM K, the higher leaf K did not improve the biomass. This might contribute to a hypothesis that plant probably needs critical cytoplasmic concentration of K in a certain range (Leigh and Wyn Jones, 1984).",

It is well known that photosynthesis is related to carbon assimilation and dry matter production (Gifford and Evans, 1981, Kramer, 1981, Zelitch, 1982) and that chlorophyll content, chloroplast ultrastructure and stomatal conductance are the major factors in photosynthetic rate (Farquhar and Sharkey, 1982, Zhao et al., 2001), However, the optimum concentration of potassium in the present study did not show an increase in the stomatal conductance, and wrinkled leaves as observed in the treatments of potassium starvation and high potassium might be due to water loss and therefore represent poor chloroplast ultrastructure (not measured in this study). Many studies have shown that appropriate potassium concentration can enhance chlorophyll content and photophosphorylase activity and maintain chloroplast inner membrane and proton gradient of thylakoid membranes, promoting photosynthetic phosphorylation (V\u00e9ry and Sentenac, 2003, Yurtseven et al., 2005, Chartzoulakis et al., 2006, Hermans et al., 2006). Therefore the maximum of net photosynthetic rate on 1.28 mM K may be mainly associated with high chlorophyll content and stable chloroplast ultrastructure, rather than limited stomata conductance.",

In the present study the optimum concentration of potassium showed lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate than potassium starvation, resulting in higher water content, which is important for cell functions. However, although the stomata conductance and transpiration rate of the four treatments with potassium were found at par with each other, high potassium resulted in lower water content as compared to 1.28 mM K.

This result is well in accordance with some other studies (Cakmak, 1994, Cakmak, 2005, Shin and Schachtman, 2004). Excess H2O2 is harmful primarily due to reaction with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids thus resulting in lipid peroxidation, membrane leakage, enzyme inactivation, and DNA breaks or mutations (Romero-Puertas et al., 2007), chlorophyll destruction (Cakmak, 1994) and growth reduction (Molassiotis et al., 2006). The increased activity of CAT and POD as observed in the present study might be to protect biomolecules from being attacked by H2O2. However, SOD activity did not show an increase with potassium starvation and high potassium. Previous studies have demonstrated that oxygen-dependence photosynthesis may be \u201cleaking\u201d energy to molecular oxygen, forming ROS such as \u2022O2\n\u2013 (Wise and Naylor, 1987, Ort and Baker, 2002). It therefore was suggested that accumulation of \u2022O2\n\u2013 might be partially suppressed by the low photosynthesis rates in these treatments. All of these implied that potassium starvation and high potassium might not result in an increase of \u2022O2\n\u2013 and excess H2O2 should have accumulated from other sources rather than from the conversion of \u2022O2\n\u2013 to H2O2. Moreover, the minimum of H2O2 content and the maximum of SOD activity at 1.28 mM K suggested that the optimal level of potassium resulted in lower oxidative stress and endowed plants with the resistance against oxidative stress, respectively.",
