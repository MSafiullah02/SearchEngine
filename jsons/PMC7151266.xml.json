The replication enzyme coding region mainly expresses and encodes two large genes: ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 ~ nsp16) that are highly conserved throughout the coronavirus. S gene, M gene, E gene, and N gene respectively encode four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is the receptor binding site, which is on the viral surface; The M protein shapes the virions, promotes membrane curvature, and is responsible for the transport of nutrients across cell membranes; the E protein plays a role in the assembly and release of virus, and is involved in viral pathogenesis; the N protein can bind virus RNA genome and maintain its stability [5]. Among them, S protein plays a key role in virus recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors, and mediating the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane [6]. Through the analysis of the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, it shares 40% sequence similarity with MERS-CoV and 80% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is more compatible with SARS-CoV [7]. In addition, by performing systematic structural simulations and immunogenicity scans of the S proteins of all coronaviruses, as well as calculating the immunogenic distance between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus subtypes, it can be concluded that the immunogenicity of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to that of SARS-CoV [8]. It is known that SARS-CoV enters target cells by binding the S protein to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, which is triggered by the cell serine protease TMPRSS2 [9]. In view of the 76% amino acid similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [10], we can speculate that the novel coronavirus may have a similar function to SARS-CoV, which has been preliminary proved in bioinformatics prediction methods as well as in vitro tests [9].",

However, through calculation methods of molecular structure simulation, the interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV and the ACE2 receptor has perfectly maintained in a holistic manner [11]. At present, it has been proved that the binding affinity between the extracellular domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors is about 10\u201320 times higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may facilitate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [12].",

Through transcription and replication, the complex forms RNA negative strands that will be translated for the structural proteins of the virus later. Then the structural proteins and RNA in the cytoplasm assemble into new viral particles, which are released from infected cells by exocytosis to infect other cells (Fig. 2\n). Each infected cell produces thousands of novel viral particles that spread to bronchi, eventually reach the alveoli, and extrapulmonary organs, causing pneumonia and targeted organic infections. However, the ACE2 receptor is not only expressed in the respiratory organs. It has been reported that, by using the RNA-seq method to express ACE2 receptors in human tissues, the number of ACE2 receptors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (high in esophagus, small intestine, and colon, but low in stomach), kidneys, and testes is nearly 100 times higher than that in the lung [15], suggesting that these tissues may also be the target organs for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. It may explain why some patients with COVID-19 developed other system injuries clinically besides respiratory system injuries. Furthermore, it have been found that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection is positive in the feces of some patients, indicating that there may be live virus in the feces, and the digestive system may be a potential route for COVID-19 [16].",

Previous studies have shown that pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung injury in patients with SARS are associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, and MCP-1) in serum [17]. And it has been reported that the MERS-CoV infection induced elevated proinflammatory cytokine concentrations (such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15, and IL-17) in serum [18]. We note that patients with COVID-19 also have high levels of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, and MCP-1 in their serum, leading to activation of the Th1 cell responses. Furthermore, the concentrations of GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 in ICU patients were higher than those in non-ICU patients, indicating that cytokine storms were associated with disease severity. Apart from this, SARS-CoV-2 infection also activates the secretion of cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) in Th2 cell responses that suppress inflammation, which is different from SARS-CoV infection [17]. Further researches are needed to investigate the responses of Th1 and Th2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",

Flow cytometry signified that the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood was greatly reduced, but their state was overactivated. Other than this, CCR4+ and CCR6+ Th17 lymphocytes with highly proinflammatory effects increased in CD4+ T lymphocytes; CD8+ T lymphocytes had a high concentration of cytotoxic granules, of which 31.6% were perforin positive, 64.2% were particle lysin positive, and 30.5% were both particle lysin and perforin positive.

Likewise, the counts of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were substantially reduced, leading to insufficient immune defenses. Furthermore, Peripheral T lymphocytes are in an over-activated state, manifested by increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8+ T lymphocytes, accounting for to a certain degree of immune injury in patients. This over activation not only failed to establish an immune response, but also caused tissue injuries, mostly manifested as severe injury in the lungs, and some patients died of multiple organ failure. This situation further accelerates the deterioration and shortens the course of the disease, hampering the establishment of fully adaptive immune response. The immunopathological injuries caused by the over activation also provides us with an idea for treating COVID-19, for example, we can probably apply the IL-17 inhibitor (secukinwmab) directed against Th17 cell activation, but it still need more exploration. Also, vaccines are also one of the solutions to make up for the lack of adaptive immune response.",

Administering 1 day after the onset of the disease, lung virus titers decreased significantly, with improvements on pulmonary function. Administering 2 days after the onset, the pulmonary virus titer can be obviously reduced, but the survival rate of mice is still relatively low. This study implied that when the pulmonary injuries reach the maximum, simply reducing the virus titer can no longer suppress the strong immune responses in mice, also showing that administering before the peak of virus replication can significantly improve symptoms of the infected mice [23]. In a rhesus monkey model infected with MERS-CoV, treating with remdesivir 24 h before infection can completely prevent symptoms caused by MERS-CoV, strongly inhibit viral replications in the respiratory tract, and prevent the formation of pulmonary lesions. Administering remdesivir 12 h after infection provides clear clinical benefits, reducing clinical symptoms, lung virus replication, and lung lesions [24].",

Intramuscular injection of 3 mg/kg had a 50% survival rate compared with the control group. Administering intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg, remdesivir rapidly decomposed into the original drug (nucleoside phosphate) in rhesus monkeys. Within 2 h, remdesivir quickly distributed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and soon afterwards activated to nucleoside triphosphate to reach a peak, with a survival rate of 100% [25]. As for pharmacokinetic studies in vivo, after the intravenous infusion of the remdesivir solution formulation at a single dose of 3\u2013225 mg for 2 h, it showed dose-linear pharmacokinetics. Intravenous infusion of 150 mg of a remdesivir solution repeated 1 h per day showed a linear pharmacokinetics over a period of 14 days. After intravenously injecting 75 and 150 mg of remdesivir solution formulations over 2 h, the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of a lyophilized formulation. Intravenous infusion of 75 mg of drug over 30 min provides similar levels of parent drug exposure to the same dose over 2 h (Table 1\n). After the intravenous infusion, remdesivir will enter the cellular metabolism to form active GS-443902 (Fig. 3C), but the frequencies of PBMCs exposure of GS-443902 is higher than those of intravenous infusion of remdesivir 150 mg within 2 h. Studies in PBMCs show that the half-life of GS-443902 is more than 35 h [26]. In the case of daily administration, the active substance of the drug GS-443902 will accumulate in vivo. As a result, in large-scale clinical trials, after the first dose of 200 mg is administered, the subsequent dose is adjusted to 100 mg to ensure the proper blood concentration in vivo [27].",

Also, no cytotoxicity, hepatorenal toxicity, or no serious adverse reactions related to metering have been observed in climbing experiments. Subjects were tolerant in studies that repeated 150 mg intravenously daily for 7\u201314 days. Remdesivir did not show any renal injuries in a multi-dose study [26]. Phase II clinical trials were conducted in Ebola virus-infected patients. In clinical trials of anti-Ebola drugs, the fatality rate of patients in the experimental group using remdesivir was 53%, and the efficacy was significantly worse than that of the two monoclonal antibodies MAb114 (fatality rate 35%) and REGN-EB3 (fatality rate 33%) [27]. The 53% fatality rate was not significantly different from the average 50% fatality rate of Ebola virus infection, and as a result, phase II clinical trials were stopped. Nevertheless, in consideration of Ebola's high lethality and monoclonal antibodies with more obvious therapeutic effects, when there are merely 175 patients injected remdesivir, we cannot assume remdesivir of no avail. The small sample size is not enough to deny the effect of remdesivir. Moreover, receptors of Ebola virus are widely distributed in vivo, not only to the respiratory tract, but also to the digestive tract, urinary tract, and blood system, etc., causing mortally hemorrhagic fever; in addition, Ebola virus persists in the eyes and central nervous system for long [28]. Once remdesivir entering body, it will be quickly distributed to the testis, epididymis, eyes, and brain, but relatively less in eyes and brain [29]. All these indicate that the wide range of spread of Ebola virus in the high lethality tissues make remdesivir control Ebola ineffectively. The Wuhan Virus Research Institute conducted in vitro experiments on COVID-19 of remdesivir and found that remdesivir was the fastest-acting and most powerful antiviral agent. In the primary culture of human airway epithelial cells in vitro, SARS-CoV\u2019s IC50 = 0.069 \u03bcM, MERS-CoV's IC50 = 0.074 \u03bcM, and the dose-dependent effect on virus inhibition [2], which is speculatively related to the fact that remdesivir triphosphate cannot be removed by nsp14-ExoN [30]. It has been conjectured the loss of function of exonuclease may be involved with the three additional nucleotides added after the incorporation of remdesivir into the extended strand [22].",

During the outbreak, the number of confirmed cases in China showed an exponential growth. The people and the government of the country tried their best to fight the epidemic with soaring combat mood. The nation's enthusiasm to fight the epidemic provides the trials on COVID-19 a favorable environment. At the same time, Article 23 of China's new Drug Administration Law, which came into effect on December 1, 2019, has enabled the \u201cCompassionate Use\u201d to develop adaptively in China. Two clinical trials on remdesivir have passed the most stringent ethical review of the 74 projects. On February 5, 2020 the trial has officially launched with experimental drugs provided by Gilead Sciences for free in China by professor Chen Wang, an academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, an internationally renowned respiratory expert who successfully suggested Chinese Government building \u201cFang Cang\u201d hospitals to cure more than 10 thousand mild or prepatent COVID-19 patients [32]. Due to the large number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China with no effective drugs, it is easy to collect clinical samples for trials theoretically. However, the rigor of the included samples hindered recruitment. As public attach more attention on prevention and treatment, fewer patients meet stringent inclusion criteria, resulting in a slow recruitment process. Another reason is that there are plenty of drugs in the clinical trials, speeding up the patients' leaving hospital. Nevertheless, it has been reported that more severe patients have been recruited, which provides favorable conditions for the trial of the severe group, and as a result, at least, it can be rapidly applied to the clinical treatment of severe patients in the near future. The need of treatment on COVID-19 is urgent, so if the results of clinical trials prove it has the potential to benefit the treatment, according to China's \u201cCompassionate Use\u201d, remdesivir will be more immediately used in patients with severe illness. Meanwhile, the opening of green channels under special circumstances to speed up the review and approval process of the drug approval center will undoubtedly help save the lives of critical patients and promote the developing of \u201cspecific drugs\u201d. In the absence of clinical trial results, it is still difficult to put remdesivir into large scale clinical use [33].

Its safety and effectiveness in treating FIP have been proven [34], with FDA's approval. It can be seen from the structure that remdesivir is phosphorylated from GS-441524, with identical target RdRp (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that though coronavirus reproduces more than 20 generations in GS-441524 yields resistance, the resistant virus is still sensitive to high concentrations of remdesivir and the fitness of the resistant virus has reduced to the same level as wild-type MERS-CoV [35], which avoids resistant mutant coronaviruses from producing resistant supervirus. At the beginning of developing remdesivir, Gilead Science selected a large number of nucleosides or their prodrugs to conduct in vitro growth inhibition experiments on Ebola-infected human microvascular endothelial cells in the laboratory and found compound A showed inhibitory activity (EC50 = 0.78 \u03bcM), and the compound A was GS-441524. Thereafter, on the basis of Compound A, after examining the activity and toxicity of compounds surrounding Compound A, modifying the prodrug, and optimizing amino acids and acyl groups, the cynomolgus monkey performs a pharmacokinetic test to select a structure such as GS-5734 (Fig. 3B) [25].

Of the 175 patients in the phase II clinical trial administering remdesivir, 9 were reported to have serious adverse reactions, 8 of whom were considered not related to drugs, and 1 with severe hypotension was thought to be drug-related, but still not confirmed [27]. The GS-441524, a drug used to treat FIP, has shown a high degree of safety in feline trials as well. The focal injection site reactions only showed in immediate pain with vocalization, occasional growling, and postural changes lasting for 30\u201360s. These initial reactions were relieved after the owners became more adept at administering the injection. Except for a cat with a slight increase in urea nitrogen and SDMA of the third round of treatment, no other symptoms of systemic poisoning were observed [34]. Relevant research signified that through a large number of synthesis and structure-activity analysis, the toxicity was greatly reduced after GS-411524 was synthesized into GS-5734 (remdesivir) [36]. The safety of remdesivir in human is further speculated.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses must replicate nucleic acids to generate new progeny virus after entering human cells. SARS-CoV-2 is known to be single stranded RNA virus, so RdRp must be used to replicate nucleic acids. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogues, act as RdRp inhibitor, can provide a scheme for blocking RNA replication. Related studies have found that it plays a role in the final stage of entering the cell, which is consistent with its expected mode of action. Wuhan Virus Research Institute carried out a vitro inhibition test and found that remdesivir can block virus infection at very low micromolar concentration of Vero E6 cells infected with virus, and the cell selectivity is high (EC50 = 0.77 \u03bcM, CC50 > 100 \u03bcM, SI > 129.87) [2]. In an anti-Ebola infection experiment on cynomolgus monkeys, intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg of remdesivir, the drug can exist in the blood for a long time and can inhibit to Ebola virus with a percentage of 100 [25]. Wuhan Virus Research Institute's research that applied remdesivir to Vero E6 cells with an EC90 = 1.76 \u03bc\u039c, lower than that of the monkey model, draw to a speculation that it could also play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infected monkeys. Based on the effectiveness in previous researches, although there are many unknowns and limits of remdesivir, the phase III clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 are not only a fight against this epidemic, but also of strategic importance to reserve more effective antiviral drugs for the future.",

Remdesivir's situational and political superiority, as well as its previous research results and application effects make it imperative to carry out the clinical trials focusing on the SARS-CoV-2. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is easy to mutate, the rapid starting of clinical trials is undoubtedly a right choice to prevent the resistance mutation due to blind medication. It has been covered in the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General\u2019s opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 on February 20, 2020 that the two clinical trials on remdesivir of therapeutics prioritized by the WHO R&D Blueprint are expected preliminary results in three weeks. On February 24, the WHO cast a vote of confidence for Gilead Sciences' experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, indicating that remdesivir has great potential and may be the best candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. Whatever the progress of the clinical trials is, we are expecting that the clinical trials of remdesivir, a starring drug, would bring outstanding breakthroughs to the treatment of COVID-19, or more promisingly, other virus infection in the future.",
