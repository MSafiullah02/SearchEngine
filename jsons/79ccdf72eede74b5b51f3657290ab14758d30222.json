Hypertransaminasemia, low platelet count and hypoalbuminemia have been associated with high mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, but whether preexisting chronic liver disease is an additional risk factor for a severe course is still matter of debate (2) . Our preliminary experience suggested that patients with cirrhosis, liver transplantation, autoimmune liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, have a benign course during the pandemic (3, 4) . Nonetheless there are no granular figures on patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD) (5) .",
