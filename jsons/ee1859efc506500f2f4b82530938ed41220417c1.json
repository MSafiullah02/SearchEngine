Virol. 81:1457 -1470 , 2009 . \u00df 2009 INTRODUCTION Influenza viruses cause symptomatic diseases in about 20% of children and 5% of adults every year [Glezen et al., 1997; Redlberger et al., 2007] . Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses, which is characterized by minus-stranded RNA and a segmented genome. Influenza viruses are divided into subtypes according to the antigenic properties of surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) [Webster et al., 1992; Saito, 2006 ]. Influenza viruses have caused epidemics and occasional pandemics. The 1918 Spanish, 1957 -1958 Asia, and 1968 -1969 Hong Kong influenza strains were at the center of three 20th century pandemics [Silverstein, 2006] . Any new influenza A virus subtype poses a threat to human health with significant morbidity and mortality.",

Influenza vaccine efficacy depends on whether currently circulating strains are related antigenically to the vaccine strains. The present study is based on clinical specimens to gather isolates of epidemic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains that appeared in Taiwan between 1980 and 2006, and to carry out phylogenetic analyses and antigenic site comparisons to define genetic and antigenic characteristics of the HA gene. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays were carried out to evaluate antigenicity between the collected isolates and vaccine strains recommended by WHO.",

H3N2 phylogenetic analysis results reveal occurrences of antigenic drift every 1-2 years. The tree topologies indicate continuous change patterns. The resulting phylogenetic tree can be divided into 12 groups according to bootstrap values (NJ method) and P-values (ML method) (Fig. 1A ). In contrast, the H1N1 phylogenetic analysis shows antigenic drift occurring every 1-4 years, with some early isolated strains reemerging more than once (Fig. 1B) . For example, the 2005-2006 isolates TW030110-06, TW120202-05, TW031612-06, and TW021011-06 clustered with some 2004 and 2005 isolates and had individual sections that were closer in structure to 1999 Taiwan isolates.

Previous researchers have reported H3 HA gene evolution as a single lineage following the introduction of H3N2 viruses into human populations in 1968; H1N1 viruses in particular represent distinct co-circulating lineages [Hay et al., 2001; Bragstad et al., 2008] . However, the previous data indicate the disappearance and reemergence of H1N1 circulating initially from 1918 to 1957 and reappearing in 1977, with the new strains sharing considerable similarities with those circulating in the 1950s [Hsieh Fig. 2 .

An average of 1-3 amino acid changes at H3N2 and H1N1 antigenic sites were found over 1-to 2-and 1-to 4-year intervals, respectively. According to Smith et al. [2002] , new drift variants of epidemiologic importance generally have four or more amino acid substitutions located in two or more antigenic sites on HA molecules. The present results also indicate that the identities of the amino acid sequences in the HA1 genes of Taiwanese isolates were at times lower than those of the nucleotide sequences. These findings indicate the dominance of non-synonymous change in the antigenic sites of human influenza A viruses, especially in the H3N2 subtype. Jian et al. [2008] reported significantly more non-synonymous than synonymous nucleotide substitutions at these antigenic sites. Plotkin and Dushoff [2003] , who studied influenza A gene sequence evolution for the past two decades, state that HA codons, especially those in antibody-binding regions, express a significant bias toward substitution mutations compared to other internal viral genes. The results from Hsieh et al. [2005] and Tseng et al. [1996] also suggest that among Taiwan epidemic strains, H3N2 shows the highest antigenic variation, followed by type B and H1N1. These findings indicate that non-synonymous changes in the HA1 gene, especially in antigenic regions, have been more frequent in H3N2 than in H1N1 over the past 25 years in Taiwan, perhaps triggering outbreaks and/or epidemics in this country.",

In addition, Hsieh et al.

Mismatches between Taiwanese epidemic and vaccine strains may be due to the unique location of Taiwan on the boundary between north and south Asia and its proximity to China, which is considered the epicenter of influenza viruses. New antigenic drift variants may spread into Taiwan by cross-border travel or migrating birds. A second possible explanation is the 6-to 9-month lag time between the selection of vaccine strain and manufacture, a phenomenon also observed in European and North American countries [de Jong et al., 2000; Carrat and Flahault, 2007; Skowronski et al., 2007] .",

            "text": "Compared to the results from phylogenetic analyses and antigenic subtypes, the data described in this article suggest a strong association between HA genetic variation and antigenic changes in influenza isolates used to link epidemic and vaccine strains. Due to the limited availability of HI testing equipment in clinical virology laboratories in Taiwan, there may be a greater reliance at present on HA sequencing for evaluating and A/India/6263/80 a comparing differences between local epidemic isolates and vaccine strains. Surface protein glycosylation plays an important role in the biology of many viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ], hepatitis C virus [Goffard et al., 2005] , West Nile virus [Hanna et al., 2005] , HIV-1 [Bashirova et al., 2001] , and influenza viruses [Roberts et al., 1993] . Surface glycosylation may help these viruses enter target cells and evade host immune responses [Fournillier et al., 2001; Abe et al., 2004] . HIV-1 and influenza A viruses have been described as using glycosylated gp120 and HA proteins to interact with and mediate entry via DC-SIGN and mannose molecules on dendritic cells [Reading et al., 2000; Bashirova et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2008] . However, N-linked glycosylation on the HA proteins of influenza viruses has been reported as serving four important biological functions: (a) adding carbohydrates to antigenic sites, which interferes with neutralizing antibody access [Skehel et al., 1984] ; (b) influencing virus pathogenicity when it occurs near cleavage sites [Ohuchi et al., 1989] ; (c) sialylating oligosaccharide chains near receptor-binding sites, which interferes with viral binding [Ohuchi et al., 1995] ; and (d) promoting the proper folding and maintenance of protein conformation or stability [Roberts et al., 1993] . According to the present results, N-linked glycosylation sites on partial HA1 proteins in both H1N1 and H3N2 have gradually increased over time. When describing this same phenomenon, Vigerust et al. [2007] and Zhang et al. [2004] also described human influenza A HA H3 and H1 HA1 accumulating sequons over time, and a gradual increase in N-linked glycosylation in and around the globular head of H3N2 viruses during the past four decades. Vigerust et al. [2007] suggest that the increased glycosylation of influenza viruses may result in decreased virulence.",

Notably, the HA gene in the 1997-2006 isolates had a characteristic deletion of Lys(K) 134 (data not shown). The results of an analysis of signature patterns of antigenic sites with H1N1 vaccine strains revealed similarities between the 1983-1985 isolates and A/Brazil/11/78 and A/Chile/1/83; the 1986-1988 isolates and A/Singapore/8/86; the 1990-1996 isolates and both A/Texas/36/91 and A/Bayern/7/95; the 1998-2000 isolates and A/Beijing/262/95; the 2000-2003 isolates and A/New Caledonia/20/99; and the 2006 isolates and A/ Solomon Islands/2/06. Distinct similarities were also observed between sections of the 2004-2006 isolates and A/Brisbane/59/2007-the WHO recommendation for the 2008-2009 vaccine strain (Fig. 2A). The following mutations were observed when comparing HA1 antigenic sites in H3N2 (Fig. 2B): Try(Y)155 (dominant in 1980-1985 isolates) changed to His(H)155 in the 1987-2002 isolates and to Thr(T)155 in the 2002-2006 isolates; Glu(E)156 (dominant in the 1980-1992 isolates) changed to Lys(K)156 and Gln(Q)156 in the 1996-2002 isolates and to His(H)156 in the 2003-2006 isolates; Glu(E)158 (dominant in the 1980-1997 isolates) changed to Lys(K)158 and in some cases to Arg(R)158 in the 1997-2006 isolates; residue 159 was originally Ser(S), but mutated into Tyr(Y)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004) and Phe(F)(2004)(2005)(2006); residue 189 in the 1980-1985 isolates mutated from Lys(K) to Arg(R)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992), Ser(S)(1996( ), and Asn(N) (2004; and Val(V)196 and Arg(R)197 (found in the 1980-1992 isolates) changed to Ala(A)196 and Gln(Q)197 in the 1997-2006 isolates.
