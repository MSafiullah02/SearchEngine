Wash the injury site thoroughly with warm water and soap. Caustic antiseptics (eg, bleach and povidone iodide) are not recommended, because they may ac- tually increase the risk of infection as a result of local tissue injury and recruitment of inflammatory cells [4] . A clear plan for follow-up assessments and points of contact is essential. Given that diagnostic testing for hepatitis viruses and HIV may be limited at overseas destinations, HCWs should consider completing baseline tests for them before travel. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most transmissible viruses related to needlestick and is generally more common in resource-limited settings than in the United States. The risk to unvaccinated persons is 37%-62% if the source is positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and is 23%-37% if the source is negative for HBeAg and positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Transmission from environmental surfaces can occur even without a cutaneous injury [4] . Fortunately, HBV vaccination is highly effective and eliminates this risk for the 90% who respond to the primary series. For those who do not respond, repeat vaccination may protect 30%-50%. Before repeating the series, check antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and HBsAg to ensure that the patient is not a chronic HBV carrier. Deep intramuscular injection with a longer needle may be needed for larger recipients [4] . If serostatus is negative after 6 immunizations, there is no benefit to additional vaccine. Seronegative HCWs remain at high risk for hepatitis B if exposed, and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (0.06 mL/kg intramuscularly) should be offered after injury and repeated in 1 month [4] . Hepatitis B immunoglobulin started within 1 week of exposure provides \u223c75% protection [4] . Tenofovir and lamivudine have activity against HBV, but there is no guidance for prophylactic use in this setting.

When latent tuberculosis is diagnosed after travel to high-risk areas, infection with MDR or XDR tuberculosis must be considered. If exposure to MDR or XDR tuberculosis is not reported or is unlikely, standard treatment is indicated. When the risk is significant or definite exposure occurs, treatment based on the suspected or known susceptibility of MDR and XDR tuberculosis exposure can be considered. This approach is often taken in the United States but is based on expert opinion and is controversial. Treatment may include 6-12 months of either ethambutol or pyrazinamide with levofloxacin or moxifloxacin [56] . The CDC recommends clinical and radiographic follow-up for 24 months for those with latent tuberculosis likely due to MDR or XDR pathogens, regardless of whether treatment of latent tuberculosis occurs.
