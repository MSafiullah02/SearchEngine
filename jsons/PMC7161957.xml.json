We obtained single cell transcriptome data sequenced by 10X Genomics of early placenta (6~14 gestational weeks) containing ~65,000 cells.[16] And 32 cell types were observed, of which four main cell types expressed ACE2 gene, including stromal cells (dS) and perivascular cells (dP) in decidua, and villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) and syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) in placenta (Fig 1A and 1B). The extravillous trophoblast (EVT) did not express ACE2 at this time. TMPRSS2 was expressed in VCT and epithelial glandular cells (Epi), and also had low expression in SCT. Another independent single cell study of trophoblasts in human placenta confirmed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in VCT and SCT (Fig 1C).[17] In addition, the EVT cells had extremely low level of ACE2 at early placenta (8 week) which was consistent with previous study, while the ACE2 expression was significantly increased in EVT at later stage of pregnancy (24 week). And TMPRSS2 also found a similar dynamic alteration (Fig 1C). These results suggest that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in VCT, SCT and EVT cells in maternal-fetal interface, and the expression level of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in maternal-fetal interface may increase along with trimester of pregnancy.",

We then screened the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in multiple fetal organs including heart, lungs, liver and kidneys based on the online published single cell transcriptome studies. In a fetal heart single cell study covering early to late fetal stages [18], we observed that ACE2 was expressed in cardiomyocytes (CM), macrophages and smooth muscle cells and pericytes (SMC/Peri). TMPRSS2 was also observed in cardiomyocytes. In a human fetal liver cell atlas [19], ACE2 was detected in erythroid, fibroblast and hepatocyte (Fig 2B). Although it seems that there was no change of ACE2 over the gestational stage (Fig 2C), the expression proportion of ACE2 was gradually increased in fibroblast and hepatocytes from early to mid-stage of pregnancy. (Fig 2D) And hepatocytes possessed the highest proportion of ACE2 positive cells compared to fibroblast and erythroid. (Fig 2D) The expression of TMPRSS2 was relatively lower, but could be found in hepatocyte and kuppffer cells. (Fig 2B) In a single cell study of fetal kidney at 7\u20139 week, we did not observe ACE2 expression in any cell type; and the abundance of TMPRSS2 was extremely low, and there were only few positive cells in ILC precursor and megakaryocyte subtypes. (Fig 2E) In a lung cell atlas of human at post-natal day 1, we observed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in airway epithelial cell and arterial endothelial cells (AT1 and AT2) (Fig 2F). As lung is the major target organ of SARS-CoV-2, the high co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 strongly suggests a high risk of infection of newborns through airborne transmission. These data showed the evidence of abundant expression of ACE2 and moderate expression of TMPRSS2 in the main human fetal organs.",

            "text": "Since the respiratory system undergoes a series of structural and functional changes necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth, and lung is a major organ to be attacked by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the dynamic changes of pulmonary cells gene expression are necessary to be investigated before and after birth to predict the potential infection of fetal and neonatal individuals. Because cell atlas of human fetal lung is unavailable, we obtained mouse lung cell atlas from late pregnancy (E16.5, E18.5) to PND 28. The cell type annotation obtained from previous report was shown in Fig 3A.[21] In late pregnancy stage, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in airway epithelial cells, which were consistent with human fetal lung. A significant alteration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed in murine lung. At earliest days (PND 1~3), we observed ACE2/TMPRSS2 was highly co-expressed in many cell types such as Sox2hi, alveolar cells (AT1/AT2), ciliated cell and Club cells. Pulmonary cells at this stage exhibited higher expression of ACE2 than that in fetal phase or later days, suggesting that newborn might be a high-risk population vulnerable to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. After the PND 1~3, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 recovered to relatively low level in lung and mainly expressed in epithelial cells, which is similar to that in adult human lung [22] (Fig 3B and 3C). These results suggest that the alternative expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in pulmonary cells before and after birth may contribute to the virus infection through vertical or respiratory transmission, and ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly co-expressed across different cell types of murine lung. And the molecular cell study of human lung at fetal and post-natal stage is further necessary, to reveal the potency and mechanism of infant infection by SARS-CoV-2.",

The second, this study reported the distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but the existence of vertical transmission and placenta dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is just speculative, which needs to be further evaluated by clinical investigations. The third, we revealed the dramatic alterations of ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression from fetal to neonatal phases in mouse lung, which may contribute to the respiratory transmission in neonates.
