However, studies have shown that mobile learning (m-learning) can be used to mitigate the challenges of STEM education. Despite, the benefits of mobile learning to rural STEM learners, its full potential has not been realized because the adoption of m-learning depends on users' acceptance. Prior studies focused on teachers' and learners' acceptance of mobile learning. However, little is known about parents' acceptance of m-learning, especially in rural areas. This study explores the acceptance of m-learning by parents of rural high school STEM learners. The study proposes the parents' acceptance of m-learning model, which extends the technology acceptance model by introducing perceived social influence and perceived resources. Stratified random sampling was used to select 200 parents in the survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PSL-SEM) was used to analyze data from 129 valid questionnaires. The proposed model explained 41% of the variance in parents' acceptance of mobile learning. Attitude towards the use was found to be the best predictor and the only factor that have a direct effect on behavioral intention to use mobile learning. However, all other factors have an indirect influence on behavioral intention. The findings revealed that for mobile learning to be successfully implemented in rural areas, resources need to be provided.",

Lack of parental involvement in their children's education also contributes to learners' poor performance in STEM-related subjects [5] . All the challenges that rural high school STEM learners face lead to demotivation when learning STEM-related subjects [4] .

            "text": "However, despite the positive effects m-learning can bring to rural STEM learners and the ubiquity of mobile devices, its adoption into the classroom is far below the expected rate [10] . Davis [11] stated that the successful adoption of any information system contingent on the user's acceptance. As a consequence of Davis' [11] assessment, it could be argued that successful implementation of m-learning in high schools of developing countries requires investigation of all stakeholders' attitudes. A plethora of studies has been conducted to identify factors that affect the acceptance of mobile learning [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, a key issue is whether academics have adopted an adequately broad approach when investigating the attitudes of the main players in a high school instructional setting [16] . Most of these m-learning acceptance studies have concentrated on teachers [14, 17] and learners [13, 17] . Little is known about the parents' attitude towards m-learning, especially in rural areas of developing countries. Teacher and learner preferences aside, parents have the last decision on whether to use m-learning. Parents' roles in m-learning include; financial support, encouragement, purchasing of the mobile device and data, monitoring that the devices are used in a meaningful way that enhances learning [8] . In spite of parents playing an important role in the adoption of m-learning, their attitude towards mobile learning has not been given the attention it deserves [19] . Ford [18] stressed the need to carry out studies on the acceptance of m-learning in the South African context and not to blindly follow examples in developed countries. On the basis of the argument thus far, the current research sought to examine the perceptions of parents of rural high school STEM learners towards m-learning.",

However, there is a big difference between what teachers hoped for and what mobile devices are actually being used for at home. At home mobile devices are mostly used for communication and playing games [39] . The most effective way of integrating mlearning into schools is through involving parents [8] . Parents' beliefs about m-learning influence their children's use [19] . Studies have shown that parents have contradictory attitudes towards the integration of m-learning in children's education [16, 19, 39] . In a study carried out by Genc [39] on the perception of parents towards mobile learning, the results show that about 46.88% of parents were having negative perceptions, while 26.88% were neutral while 26.56% were having positive perceptions towards mobile learning. Genc's [39] results were congruent to Bourgonjon et al's [16] findings, who stated that some parents expressed negative perception towards the use of mobile digital games-based learning. In both studies [16, 39] , parents who had positive perceptions towards the integrating technology cited the usefulness of it in their children's education. However, parents were concerned about the health and social issues associated with overexposure to technology [16] . A plethora of studies has shown that parents' PEOU has a positive effect on their ATT and PU [10, 16, 17, 19, 29, 39] . However, there is some inconsistency when it comes to the relationship between parents' PEOU and their BI to allow their children to use m-learning. Studies [10] and [16] found that PEOU does not necessarily have a direct effect on BI. On the contrary, Alshmrany et al. [17] reported that PEOU has a positive direct effect on BI. Tsuei [19] studied the effect of parents' PSI on their PU and PEOU. The results showed that parent-teacher communication positively influenced both PU and PEOU. However, the communication between children and their parents only influenced parents' PU but not PEOU [19] . These results show that social influence plays an important role in parents' acceptance of information and communication technology (ICT) learning. Tsuei [19] highlighted the need to build partnerships between schools and parents for the successful integration of ICT learning.",

In the studies [31] [32] [33] , researchers investigated the effects of the availability of resources on teachers' acceptance of ICT into the classroom. They found that lack of laptops, computer technical support from peers negatively affected the integration of ICT into the classroom. Mboweni [34] found that most of the rural parents rely on social grants and have financial problems. M-learning requires money for purchasing of devices and data. Basing on the results of Lim [31] and Mboweni [34] , one can learn that rural parents' perceived resources will affect their PU and PEOU towards the use of m-learning.

In this study, PSI is when parents of high school STEM learners consider the view of those who are important to them whether they should or should not allow their child to use m-learning. Parents of STEM learners in rural areas are influenced by messages about m-learning. This was suggested by Venkatesh et al. [21] who stated that people internalize the beliefs of other people and make them part of their own belief system. If parents think that their community, children, and teachers are expecting them to accept the use of m-learning, they would have a positive attitude towards m-learning. Therefore, the hypothesis: H9: Perceived social influence has a positive effect on perceived usefulness H10: Perceived social influence has a positive effect on attitude towards the use.

The results show that the model was appropriate for determining the rural parents' acceptance of m-learning as it explains 41% of the variance in BI. It was found that all the antecedents predict behavioral intention to use m-learning. However, only parents' ATT has a direct effect on BI. It would be reasonable to infer that when rural parents have positive feelings towards the use of m-learning, these positive feelings will reinforce their intention to allow their children to use m-learning to learn STEM-related subjects. Parents' ATT mediates the effect of their PU, PSI, PR and PEOU on their BI. The results show some notable differences from prior adoption studies [10, 11, 13] . In contrary to the previous finding, PU has an insignificant effect on rural parents' BI [13, 19] . The results show that rural high school STEM learners' parents are not acquainted with the usefulness of mobile devices in the classroom. However, the results also confirm the finding of [19] , who found that PU indirectly influences users' BI by the mediation of ATT. This might mean that even though rural parents have limited knowledge about the benefits that m-learning bring into STEM learning, that little knowledge they possess positively affects their attitudes towards the use of m-learning for STEM learning.",

This shows that rural parents consider the effort needed to learn to use m-learning more important when adopting it than its utility. The finding might be due to parents belonging to the \"digital immigrants\" generation which struggle to use mobile devices to carry out specific tasks. The results also show that parents are not indifferent to what other people (teachers, society and children) think about m-learning, as their ATT towards m-learning was influenced by their PSI better than their PU. These results are line with the findings of Tsuei [19] , who found that teacher-parent and children-parents communication influenced parents' technology acceptance. PSI also positively affect PU and BI by the mediating of ATT. The results suggest that rural parents value what people important to them say about the use of mlearning for STEM learning. Therefore, it is important for teachers and learners to provide rural parents with an awareness of the potential of m-learning for STEMrelated subjects.",

This finding was not surprising due to the rural environment in which the study was carried. Most of the families in rural areas are living in poverty and depend on social grants as their source of income [34] . It is also interesting to note that PR has indirect effects on ATT and PU by the mediating effect of PEOU. The results suggest that for rural parents, the availability of resources affects the usefulness and ease of use, which in turn affects parents' attitudes towards m-learning. The conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that, for a successful implementation of m-learning for STEM learning in rural areas, resources need to be provided. Based on the current findings, the following suggestions can be made to mobile developers and instructional designers and the Department of Basic Education (DBE), in line with Li et al. [13] and Nikou et al. [14] who studied learners' and teachers' acceptance of m-learning. Mobile developers should make m-learning platforms user-friendly and contain as much learning material and assessments as possible. This is because rural parents, teachers and learners consider utility and ease of use to be important when adopting m-learning. The DBE should provide resources needed for mobile learning. The researchers suggest that the DBE should supply rural STEM learners with tablets. Furthermore, the DBE should use offline portals to support m-learning in rural areas, make some partnerships with cellular network service providers to allow some educational platforms and websites to be accessed freely, this will remove the burden of buying data from rural parents.",

In this study perceived social influence and perceived resources were added to TAM.

The results also show that all the variables in the model predict behavioral intention to use mlearning. The predicting power of these variables is as follows: ATT, PEOU, PR, PSI and PU. The lessons that can be drawn from the study are that rural parents' attitudes towards m-learning and the perceived ease of use are the most important factors that they consider when accepting m-learning. This might mean that parents expect their children to be trained on how to use m-learning before its implementation.
