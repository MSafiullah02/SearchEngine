            "text": "This study focuses on investigating the manner in which a prompt quarantine measure suppresses epidemics in networks. A simple and ideal quarantine measure is considered in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately after it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly isolated. The efficiency of this quarantine in suppressing a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is tested in random graphs and uncorrelated scale-free networks. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that the prompt quarantine measure outperforms random and acquaintance preventive vaccination schemes in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals. The epidemic threshold for the SIR model is analytically derived under the quarantine measure, and the theoretical findings indicate that prompt executions of quarantines are highly effective in containing epidemics. Even if infected individuals are detected with a very low probability, the SIR model under a prompt quarantine measure has finite epidemic thresholds in fat-tailed scale-free networks in which an infected individual can always cause an outbreak of a finite relative size without any measure. The numerical simulations also demonstrate that the present quarantine measure is effective in suppressing epidemics in real networks.",

            "text": "Recently, several studies were devoted to examining the spread of epidemics on networks in which nodes represent individuals and edges represent their social or sexual relationships through which an infectious disease spreads (as shown in review [1] and references therein). Theoretical studies for epidemiological models demonstrated that infectious diseases could spread very easily in highly heterogeneous networks [2, 3] . Specifically, two fundamental epidemic models, namely the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [4] and the susceptible-infected-susceptible model [5] , exhibit outbreaks of finite relative sizes with an infinitesimal infection rate if the underlying network is fat-tailed scale-free such that the degree distribution obeys p k \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 , with \u03b3 3 [6, 7] . In order to contain epidemics, several control measures were proposed that utilize network information. Epidemics can be suppressed by effective vaccination schemes such as the target vaccination [8] , the acquaintance vaccination [9, 10] , the PageRank-based vaccination [11] , and the graph partitioning vaccination [12] . Theoretically, the above vaccination schemes succeed in containing epidemics in which a network is highly heterogeneous although these vaccination schemes are considered as a preventive measure wherein it is necessary to complete vaccinations prior to the appearance of an infectious disease in a network.",

Dybiec et al. [13, 14] considered a spatial epidemic model in a situation in which individuals can be infectious prior to exhibiting symptoms (and therefore prior to detection), and a local control measure is probabilistically applied in a neighborhood centered around a detected infectious individual. The results indicated the optimal radius necessary * takehisa.hasegawa.sci@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp \u2020 nemoto@statphys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp for the aforementioned type of a control neighborhood to contain epidemics in terms of economic costs associated with disease and treatment. Takeuchi and Yamamoto [15] studied a ring vaccination in which susceptible individuals who came in contact with infected ones were probabilistically vaccinated. The findings revealed that the ring vaccination scheme reduced the infection rate and the number of vaccinated nodes becomes considerably small when compared to those in the preventive strategies. However, the basic reproduction number (and thus the epidemic threshold) remained equal to those of random preventive vaccination, and this failed to contain epidemics in a highly heterogeneous network unless almost all individuals were vaccinated. There are also studies investigating dynamic reactions of individuals to the spread of epidemics [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , such as behavioral responses of individuals by reducing their contact rates [25] , based on the number of infected neighbors or by rewiring connections (i.e., disconnecting their connections to infected neighbors and reconnecting others) [21] .",

The order parameter r defined by the mean fraction of the R nodes in final configurations is used to obtain r = 0 for T T c and r > 0 for T > T c in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. The epidemic threshold depends on the structure of the underlying network. With respect to uncorrelated networks with degree distribution p k , the local tree approximation gives T c = k / k(k \u2212 1) [26] , where \u00b7 represents the average of a quantity weighted by p k . This indicates that it is considerably easier for a global outbreak to occur on heterogeneous networks when compared to homogeneous networks: T c = 0 for fat-tailed scale-free networks (SFNs) of p k \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 with 2 < \u03b3 3, although T c = 1/ k > 0 for random graphs (RGs) in which the degree distribution obeys p k \u2248 k k e \u2212 k /k! with the same mean degree as that of the SFNs. This is followed by introducing a prompt quarantine measure with respect to the SIR model. The proposed quarantine measure assumes that node i can be detected (for example, by public health authorities) with a detection probability f immediately after it becomes infected, and the detected node i and its neighbors (except nodes already removed or quarantined) are promptly isolated. The detected and quarantined nodes lose the capability to infect others and to be further infected. It is also assumed that nodes already infected are cured by appropriate treatments when they are isolated. In order to incorporate this quarantine measure, an extended SIR model is considered by introducing the following additional states: detected (D) and quarantined (Q).

Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the quarantine measure outperformed the random and acquaintance vaccination schemes with respect to the reduction of the number of R nodes. The generating function formalism for uncorrelated networks was used to obtain the occurrence probability of global outbreaks and the epidemic threshold T c .

Pereira and Young [30] studied the effectiveness of delayed isolations for infected nodes (not including their neighbors) in controlling susceptibleinfected-susceptible epidemics to show that the disease is (not) effectively controlled if the delay in isolating infected nodes is shorter (longer) than a certain critical value. Very recently, Strona and Castellano [31] considered the SIR model with a quarantine measure, having a delay in the early stage of epidemics, and found the rapid decay in its efficiency; if the implementation is not prompt enough, then the quarantines become highly inefficient. For our case, the effectiveness of quarantines is expected to be weakened when a delay among infection, detection, and quarantine is incorporated. For example, the model can be extended to have a delay time t delay for the execution of a quarantine after a node becomes \"detected.\" In the simplest setting, an infected node i with degree k i can try to infect further k add = min(t delay ,k i \u2212 k D ) neighbors after its k D th neighbor becomes detected. Monte Carlo simulations for such cases show that the performance of quarantine strategy actually becomes worse with increasing delay time t delay (not shown). The epidemic threshold also decreases as t delay increases and reaches the threshold for the random vaccination with the same value of f when t delay becomes larger than the largest degree k max [32] .",
