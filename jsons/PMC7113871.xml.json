CV-B5 infection in human is often associated with serious neurological symptoms like aseptic meningitis. Although less common than neurological symptoms, both cardiomyopathy and diabetes have also been reported for some CV-B5 infection cases (Grumbach et al., 1999, Marier et al., 1975). Meningitis cases caused by CV-B5 have been reported in many countries, including the United States (Kopecka et al., 1995, Tavakoli et al., 2008), Belgium (Thoelen et al., 2003), Greece (Papa et al., 2006), France (Antona et al., 2007), Spain (Trallero et al., 2010), Brazil (Dos Santos et al., 2006), Korea (Baek et al., 2011, Lee et al., 2007), and India (Kumar et al., 2011), among others. In China, sporadic CV-B5 infection cases are frequent, and CV-B5 outbreaks have also been reported (Chen et al., 2013, Yen et al., 2009).",

Further, data acquired via these detection methods have helped generate predictive insights in epidemiological studies (e.g. historical infections and population immunity) (Gao et al., 2016b, Ji et al., 2012). Current conventional practices for anti-enterovirus NtAbs titer measurement employ microtiter plate neutralization assays based on the inhibitory effect of these NtAbs on the cytopathic effect (CPE) in cells (Chonmaitree et al., 1988). Although these methods have been in use for a long time, there are biosafety concerns about their use, and these assays have other major shortcomings. They are only semi-quantitative, labor-intensive, and time-consuming which requires at least 5\u20137 days before results can be obtained. These weaknesses have highlighted the need to develop superior alternative methods for the quantification of NtAbs titers.",

These pseudovirus-based neutralization assays offer superior biosafety and improved sensitivity performance over assays with wild type viruses. It is thus not surprising that pseudovirus assays are increasingly popular and are now used to measure NtAbs titers against Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Montefiori et al., 2005), Influenza virus (Tsai et al., 2009), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-coV) (Li et al., 2003, Sui et al., 2004). In the past, our research group has been focused on HFMD associated enteroviruses. We have to date developed infectious pseudoviruses which do not cause CPE effect on cells and established safe and efficient pseudovirus-based NtAbs detection methods for enterovirus 71(EV-A71) (Wu et al., 2013a), coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) (Hao et al., 2016), and coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) (Chen et al., 2016). Here, we successfully established a robust pseudovirus infection system for CV-B5 and subsequently developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for the measurement of anti-CV-B5 NtAbs titers. Direct comparison of traditional CPE-based microtiter plate neutralization assays for CV-B5 against our new pseudovirus-based assay revealed that our new method is superior in terms of biosafety, detection limit, and quantitative performance. Our new method should thus be viewed as a desirable replacement for previously-standard CPE assays for the quantification of anti-CV-B5 NtAbs titers.",

Replicon RNA could be encapsidated by capsid proteins when respective capsid expresser was provided. We first attempted to produce CV-B5 pseudovirus with CV-B5 replicon RNA and CV-B5 capsid; however, CV-B5 pseudovirus encapsidation was not successful using in vitro transcribed CV-B5 replicon RNA. We next tried co-transfection of CV-B5 replicon, CV-B5 capsid expresser, and pcDNA3.0-T7 polymerase; but in vivo transcribed CV-B5 replicon RNA also failed to produce CV-B5 pseudovirus with luciferase reporter (data not shown). Inspired by our finding that CV-A16 could be pseudotyped with EV-A71 replicon RNA and CV-A16 capsid (Chen et al., 2016), we found that CV-B3 replicon RNA instead of EV-A71 replicon RNA could be efficiently encapsidated by CV-B5 capsid to produce infectious CV-B5 pseudovirus (Fig. 1B).

The instability of CV-B5 replicon RNA in pseudovirus producing cells (HEK-293T) had not been anticipated (data not shown). However, replicon RNA from EV-A71 and CV-B3 were comparatively stable during pseudovirus production. Phylogenetic studies that revealed intra-serotypic recombination in some clinical CV-B5 isolates, suggesting that CV-B5 may have an unstable genomic structure (Hu et al., 2012, Ma et al., 2013, Oberste et al., 2004), it is possible that our genetic modifications of the CV-B5 genome may have further aggravated this putative instability.",

            "text": "Our pseudovirus infection system for CV-B5 represents yet another successful application of the trans-encapsidation strategy to produce an infectious pseudovirus. CV-B3 replicon RNA could be encapsidated with CV-B5 capsid to produce an infectious pseudovirus; EV-A71 replicon RNA could not be encapsidated with CV-B5 capsid. We previously reported that EV-A71 replicon RNA could be encapsidated with CV-A16 capsid to produce an infectious CV-A16 pseudovirus, while CV-B3 replicon RNA could not be encapsidated with CA-A16 capsid (Chen et al., 2016). These patterns of compatibility in trans-encapsidation experiments suggested that similar virion assembly mechanisms may be shared between CV-B3 and CV-B5, and between EV-A71 and CV-A16. However, it seems likely that the trans-encapsidation mechanism adopted by CV-B3 and CV-B5 is distinct from that adopted by EV-A71 and CV-A16. It is notable that both EV-A71 and coxsackievirus (CV) CV-A16 are group A enteroviruses and are known to share the same viral receptor: human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) (Yamayoshi et al., 2009). Similarly, CV-B3 and CV-B5 are Group B enteroviruses that share a receptor: coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) (Bergelson et al., 1997, Tomko et al., 1997). In light of these relationships, it would be intriguing to classify many enteroviruses accordingly and explore likely major determinants involved in enterovirus assembly. We anticipate that replicon RNA from EV-A71 and CV-B3 could be used as probes to analyze the assembly compatibility among other group A and group B enteroviruses.",

            "text": "In this work, we developed a sensitive NtAbs quantification assay based on this CV-B5 pseudovirus. We found that CV-B3 NtAb positivity in adults were very high. We compared the pseudovirus assay with CPE assay, which is referred as a gold standard assay for the detection of anti-enterovirus NtAbs. Although improvement on specificity was needed in the future, this pseudovirus based assay provided a superior replacement for anti-CV-B5 NtAbs detection. Development of anti-serum reference standard for CV-B5 would help to optimize this pseudovirus assay, so that proper cutoff value to achieve the highest Youden\u2019s index could be set to produce the best balance of overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity with respect to the reference CPE assay. To date, we had established pseudovirus based NtAbs quantification assay for EV-A71, CV-A16, CV-B3, and CV-B5. Following the successful licensure of EV-A71 vaccine in China, changes in HFMD pathogen spectrum have been noticed and multivalent vaccines against more health threatening enteroviruses co-circulating in HFMD epidemics have been proposed to be ideally for HFMD control (Klein and Chong, 2015, Mao et al., 2016). There are challenges in many aspects of multivalent vaccine development, e.g. selection of potential vaccine strains (Klein and Chong, 2015). Further, safe, convenient and robust bioassays as well as animal models for efficacy evaluation are necessarily required. These aforementioned pseudovirus-based NtAbs quantification assays for HFMD associated enteroviruses could be used for evaluation of vaccine induced humoral immune response. Establishment of reference standards like antiserum standards for measuring vaccine-induced NtAb titers is also an important part for bioassay development (Cooper et al., 2015, Liang et al., 2011). Furthermore, a new EV-A71 infection mouse model had been successfully established based on EV-A71 pseudovirus, which also showed impressive advantages in efficacy evaluation of EV-A71 vaccine (Zhou et al., 2016).Thus, introduction of enteroviruse pseudoviruses (e.g. CV-A16, CV-B3 and CV-B5) to mouse infection models would also greatly facilitate the development of multivalent vaccine for HFMD.",
