            "text": "The first description of a successful split liver transplantation using a left-lateral graft for a paediatric recipient and the remnant extended right graft for an adult recipient was reported by our institution in 1988 [1]. Before the introduction of split liver transplantation, reduced size liver transplantation had been used for paediatric liver transplantation, which resulted in the waste of liver segments 4\u20138 plus segment 1 [2]. Since 1988, with increasing experience and improvement of the surgical technique, the significant potential of split liver transplantation became apparent, and this modality soon became common practice [3\u20139]. Therefore, split liver transplantation from deceased donors still has a place in paediatric as well as adult liver transplantation [6\u201314]. More advanced developments include the full anatomical liver split procedure for transplantation in two smaller adult liver recipients [10\u201314]. Today, the splitting procedure can be done either in situ during liver procurement in the deceased heart-beating donor or ex situ [7\u20139]. Both methods are considered to increase the risk for biliary complications [7\u20139, 14\u201322]. Biliary complications belong to the most serious morbidities after all types of liver transplantation [18, 19]. Partial liver grafts have a higher incidence of biliary complications as a result of the risks of biliary leakage from the transected liver surface and as a result of the risks of surgical dissection in the hepatic hilum, which may cause injury to the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts [3\u201317, 23, 24]. It could be demonstrated that the in situ split of the liver graft in the deceased donor is associated with significantly shorter cold ischemic times compared with the ex situ split procedure [6\u20139]. Unfortunately, the in situ split approach often is restrained by logistical and technical efforts and lack of expertise as well as financial expenditures, all of which are necessary for its ultimate success [4\u201311]. In practice, about half of all split liver transplantation procedures in Europe and the United States are done after ex situ split of the liver graft [7\u20139, 25\u201328]. Split liver transplantation is still discussed controversially for high-urgency and retransplant cases and some transplant centres still hesitate to use split liver grafts in adults [7\u20139, 17]. Our goal is to evaluate the long-term results of ex situ split liver transplantation and the influences of complications and their management.",

The middle hepatic vein was preserved in all full right grafts and reconstructed in all full left grafts with an autologous venous patch, harvested either from the graft itself or from an iliac vein of the donor (n = 10; segments 1\u20134 or segments 2\u20134). The venous outflow was preserved in all cases for segments 5\u20138 in the presence of large accessory hepatic veins (V6, V7, V8), because right split grafts were always transplanted with the complete vena cava.",

As could be demonstrated in Fig. 1, these results were influenced by the era during which the transplants have been performed. In this context, it is very interesting to note that patient survival has improved continuously from era to era. It can be assumed that the development of our series reflects a learning curve since the introduction of split liver transplantation in 1987. The comparatively high retransplant rate (22.9 %) is a result of the very long observational period. Mean graft survival of split liver transplants that were followed by a retransplant procedure during follow-up was 533 (range 1\u20132,655) days. A significant improvement of graft survival from era 1 to 3 was observed (p = 0.041, log-rank). Taken together, we consider that our results are largely comparable to other recently published series of split liver transplantation from specialised centres within comparable eras [17, 20, 21, 32\u201341]. It appears noteworthy that this retrospective long-term study is able to demonstrate a mean observed patient survival of 5.7 years (median 5.6 years; range 0\u201319.0 years) and a mean observed graft survival of 4.7 years (median 3.6 years; range 0\u201316.6 years) and an observed 10-year survival rate of 40.6 % (mean 12.9 years, median 12.6 years; range 10\u201319 years) after adult ex situ split liver transplantation.

The type of biliary reconstruction, the usage of a hepaticojejunostomy, and the usage of a T-tube all had no significant statistical influence on patient and graft survival and also not on the later occurrence of biliary complications (Table 2). A recently published meta-analysis on the routine use of a T-tube in liver transplantation is in line with our findings [43]. In our experience T tubes can be omitted and are omitted in our current practice of split and full size liver transplantation even though the data presented in our paper does not seem to provide clear evidence that this is the right choice. There is no conclusive evidence available for the influence of different types of biliary tract reconstruction on biliary complications after split liver transplantation or on graft or patient survival due to a complete lack of randomized, controlled trials [15, 17\u201319, 44]. Interestingly, a recent study including all types of liver transplantation could demonstrate that hepaticojejunostomy was an independent risk factor for the development of hepatic artery thrombosis [45]. We also found a significant influence of hepaticojejunostomy on the development of hepatic artery thrombosis in this series. In our practice, Roux-en-Y biliary reconstruction is limited to cases transplanted for PSC and to cases with destructed central bile ducts (e.g., in retransplant cases) as is the case in full size liver transplantation. The current series contains many patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis because our hepatologists have a research focus and a special clinical interest in this disease.",

Hepatic artery thrombosis had a significant influence on graft survival but not on patient survival. It is interesting to note that the overall incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis after transplantation (n = 17; 13.2 %) was slightly more frequent compared with the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 4; 11.8 %) in cases with biliary complications which may be a consequence of early retransplantation after hepatic artery thrombosis before biliary complications could manifest in some cases. It could be demonstrated in an earlier study on hepatic artery thrombosis after all kinds of liver transplantations that cold ischemic time, the use of blood and plasma, and the use of aortic conduits in arterial reconstruction were significantly associated with hepatic artery thrombosis [45]. This association could only be confirmed in this study for cold ischemic time. Although surgical revision used to be the standard treatment for biliary complications after liver transplantation, nonoperative management of biliary complications has more and more become a standard alternative practice over the past two decades in this and other series [47, 51\u201354]. In this series, surgical and interventional methods were used alone or combined for the treatment of biliary complications, including operative reanastomosis or suture, retransplantation, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic stent placement, and either computed tomography or ultrasound-guided interventional drainage (Table 3). Interventional treatment versus surgical treatment and the type of biliary complications after adult ex situ split liver transplantation both had no significant influence on patient or graft survival (Table 4).",

Unfortunately, these organs appear to become rarer and rarer within the Eurotransplant community [58]. Several reports could demonstrate that split liver transplantation has potential equal to that of whole organ liver transplantation not only for adult but also for paediatric recipients [4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 16, 17, 20\u201322, 39\u201341, 55]. Merion et al. [29] found that split liver transplantation could provide enough organs to satisfy the entire current demand for paediatric donor livers in the United States and thus provide more aggregate years of life than whole organ transplantation and result in larger numbers of recipients. Encouraging results have been reported from Ghent for adult split liver transplantation with extended right lobe grafts from deceased donors that did not meet the Eurotransplant criteria for optimal donors [59].",
