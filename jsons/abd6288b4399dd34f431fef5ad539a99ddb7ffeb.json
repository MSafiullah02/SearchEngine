            "text": "The COVID-19 epidemic, first reported in China in December 2019, has now spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 In the past three months, many countries have struggled to put together a coherent strategy against the epidemic, even while more than two million infections and 160,000 deaths have been reported. 2 Countries with limited resources are likely to face even greater difficulties against this epidemic, as they grapple with limited resources and fewer intervention options. [3] [4] [5] Control strategies and interventions against the spread of COVID-19 center around three broad options: one, reduce the number of infectious individuals; two, reduce the number of susceptible individuals; and three, reduce contact between susceptible and infectious individuals. [6] [7] [8] [9] In the absence of a vaccine against the COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV2 virus, or an effective treatment, available control strategies are limited. They include ones that aim to reduce the burden of infectious individuals (by identifying and isolating infectious individuals) and ones that aim to reduce contact (with physical distancing measures, or a lockdown). Countries like Taiwan and Vietnam have been able to contain the epidemic by means of meticulous public health measures including aggressive testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine combined with border entry monitoring. [10] [11] [12] Korea has similarly been able to mitigate the epidemic by means of aggressive testing and isolation combined with physical distancing measures. 13, 14 China on the other hand has managed to suppress the epidemic by means of a strategy involving strictly enforced lockdowns, aggressive testing isolation and quarantine. 15, 16 Countries like Nepal, which have been declared a high risk country for a COVID-19 epidemic by the WHO, stand to face difficult strategic choices and challenges given the limited amount of healthcare resources. These challenges have been evident in the last three months. On January 24, 2020 Nepal became the first country in South Asia to report a SARS-CoV2 infection--in a student who had returned from Wuhan, China. Although no new cases were reported until March 23 (since then, as of April 20, 29 more cases have been reported), 17 Nepal tried to put together a response against a possible epidemic: First, as a precautionary measure the government began limiting international air travel from affected countries in February and later from the rest of the world. Land border crossings with India remained open until they were finally closed on March 24, 2020. 18 Pre-emptive physical distancing measures were introduced in the middle of March, when schools were closed and annual exams canceled. The public was advised to avoid all non-essential events and gatherings. Long distance buses were closed on March 23, 2020 following which a nationwide lockdown--which has now been extended until April 27--was declared on March 24. In these two months less than 10 000 RT-PCR based tests (<3 per 10 000 people) for SARS-CoV2 have been carried out in the country. 17 Testing volumes have been low due to minimal testing kit and reagent availability, strict testing criteria, as well as limited testing locations.",

To study this, we built a mathematical model to simulate the consequences of adopting various strategies in preventing or controlling a possible COVID-19 epidemic in Kathmandu, Nepal. We first estimated the burden of an unmitigated epidemic. We then assessed the potential effects of implementing control interventions: a lockdown (total shutdown of movement), physical distancing (avoiding large gatherings, no handshake, minimizing physical proximity) , or aggressive testing and contact tracing with quarantine. In addition, we explored the effect of these interventions when implemented together. We analysed potential demand for health services and the relative mortality burden in each of these scenarios.",

Compartment D represents individuals that are dead. These compartments were further divided into 16 age-structured groups each and populated based on the age-specific population distribution of Nepal. Population mixing patterns were given by a Nepali population specific contact matrix. 21 In the model, susceptible individuals in the age-group i move from the compartment ( S ij ) to the exposed compartment ( E ij ) based on the force of infection (\u03bb ij ). The force of infection is obtained by multiplying the transmission rate \u03b2 ij to the proportion of infectious contacts. \u03b2 ij is the transmission .

Testing volumes however, remain a fraction of that. Only less than 10 000 RT-PCR based tests have been carried out in the entire country as of April 22. A similar number of antibody based rapid diagnostic tests have been carried out as well, but their accuracy has been suspect. Inaccuracy of currently available tests has made case finding difficult. 40 A control strategy that targets finding a fixed percentage of the daily burden of infections scales in a geometric fashion making it programmatically challenging to implement in places with limited capacity for effective public health interventions. However, even while many countries with limited resources are finding it difficult to sufficiently escalate testing, isolation and contact tracing, some others have successfully done so. 41 Community and local government led best practices are beginning to emerge where local governments and communities are facilitating testing and quarantine of possible contacts. 11, 42, 43 Technology based solutions may additionally help in contact-tracing and following up in individuals in isolation and quarantine. 44 Given the current focus on a lockdown, we have not modelled the effect of targeted physical distancing measures like school closures or measures that target the elderly. However, these measures could be significantly important, given people in Nepal tend to live in intergenerational households that have significant contact between family members. While our use of a Nepal specific synthetic contact matrix minimises some of these concerns, the effect of targeted physical distancing measures needs to be evaluated in their local context.

First, we assume that there has been no additional importation of COVID-19 cases in Kathmandu. This assumption is not true, since there have been additional imported cases diagnosed since the first case, however this does not invalidate our findings. We assume that everyone is equally susceptible to the virus and that there is no immunity. However, as yet it is unclear if this assumption holds true. We make assumptions about the effectiveness of a lockdown and home isolation. We also assume that it would be possible to enforce physical distancing measures that reduce contact between individuals by about a third for the entire year, an assumption that might not hold over time as the public grows weary of such measures. 45 In addition, prolonged physical distancing measures could themselves lead to adverse health, economic and well-being outcomes--an issue that is likely to severely impact many countries that do not have adequate social safety provisions. This is another area for future work. Our use of a compartmental model offers a computationally simpler method to model the epidemic, although this approach is not likely to be methodologically valid if an epidemic is yet to be established. 46, 47 We overcame this limitation by assuming that there already were about 185 infected individuals and that local transmission was under way when we began our model simulation.",

            "text": "Our study offers important insights on mounting an effective response against the COVID-19 epidemic in a resource limited setting. As we have outlined above, an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic has the potential to cause significant mortality that will be exacerbated by the unmet demand for health services. Our findings suggest that the best control strategy against the epidemic is a combination of interventions that aim to identify and isolate infected individuals and reduce contact between individuals by means of ongoing physical distancing measures. A lockdown can prevent the escalation of the epidemic, but is likely to be of limited value if no additional control measures are put in place.",
