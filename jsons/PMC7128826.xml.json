RSV, a member of the viral genus Pneumovirus, contains a negative sense RNA genome that is classified into two genetic subtypes, A and B. RSV infection is commonly diagnosed by the detection of RSV antigens in respiratory secretions using enzyme immunoassays or fluorescent antibodies (FA), or by culturing respiratory specimens in traditional cell cultures or using rapid shell vial methods. Culture tests are labor intensive, technically challenging, and time consuming. Furthermore, both culture and antigen detection assays may lack sensitivity, especially for samples from adult patients (Falsey et al., 1996).",

The quantitative assay was compared to FA for detection of RSV in a large number of pediatric respiratory samples submitted over a 6-month period to a clinical virology laboratory.

            "text": "The quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay described here for the detection of both A and B subtypes of RSV exhibited excellent sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Several features combine to make this a unique assay, including consensus primers targeting the RSV matrix gene, reverse transcription and PCR in a one-step reaction, absolute quantification based on an RNA standard curve, and amplification of a control molecule multiplexed with the RSV reaction. Typing of the RSV positive specimens was performed with a second real-time RT-PCR assay that used primers to the RSV polymerase gene and two type-specific probes labeled with different fluorescent reporter dyes. Absolute quantification of RSV was achieved using standard curves that were generated with negative sense RNA transcripts of the RSV PCR amplicons, providing targets for reverse transcription and amplification that were similar to the RSV genomic RNA present in the clinical specimens. Although the one-step RT-PCR reaction could detect as few as 10 viral RNA copies, the lower limit of sensitivity for clinical specimens (1000 RSV copies/mL) was affected by the amount of respiratory specimen that could be added to a reaction (10 \u03bcl) without producing inhibition. An external control RNA (EXO) was added to each specimen prior to RNA extraction and amplified using primers and probe included in the RSV reaction to prevent false negative RSV results due to poor RNA extraction or to inhibitors of the RT-PCR reaction. Initially low EXO amplification prompted repeat testing of 12.7% of the RSV negative specimens. One sample was subsequently eliminated from analysis due to lack of amplification and two additional RSV positive specimens were identified among the 58 samples that became satisfactory for EXO amplification on repeat testing. Simultaneous amplification of the external control in the RSV reaction provides greater confidence that the negative specimens are truly negative for RSV RNA.",

Nineteen (90%) of the 21 PCR positive, FA negative specimens had low viral loads (less than 106 copies/mL) compared to only 13% of samples positive by both methods. Fifty percent of the 28 samples with fewer than 105 RSV copies/mL were FA negative, suggesting a lower limit of sensitivity for FA in this range. All 21 discrepant RT-PCR positive samples were again positive when retested with the quantitative assay and also with the RSV type specific RT-PCR assay, providing evidence that these were not false positive results.",

The median number of 2.0\u00d7107 RSV copies/mL among all RSV positive specimens was very similar to that found by Borg et al. (2003) and Gueudin et al. (2003) who used quantitative real-time PCR assays to detect RSV type A only, and types A and B, respectively, in pediatric respiratory specimens. In contrast, other investigators, using tissue cell cultures to quantify the virus, detected approximately 100-fold lower titers of RSV in specimens from children than are apparent by PCR (Buckingham et al., 2000, DeVincenzo et al., 2003, Englund et al., 1996, Hall et al., 1976, Wright et al., 2002). RSV subtypes A and B were detected with equal frequency in our study. In contrast, the ratio of RSV subtypes detected has varied greatly among different populations tested as reported by others. The proportion of RSV positive samples that were subtype A has ranged from 15 to 100%, with type A samples more prevalent in most years (Freymuth et al., 1991, Hall et al., 1990, Hu et al., 2003, Kehl et al., 2001, Ong et al., 2001, Tang et al., 1999, Walsh et al., 1997, Whiley et al., 2002). In this population of mostly hospitalized children in Seattle, the presence and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization. These results are in agreement with those of Hall et al. (1976) who reported that the quantity of RSV shed was significantly greater in infants less than 1 month of age.",

It offers several advantages over viral culture including its potential for high throughput processing, objective endpoint, simpler specimen handling requirements, and ability to quantify a wide range of viral loads. Advantages over FA include increased sensitivity and the objective endpoint. Although the time required to process and test small numbers of samples is similar for both real-time RT-PCR and FA (approximately 4 h to complete 10 specimens), analysis of larger numbers of specimens is more quickly accomplished using RT-PCR because as many as 40 clinical samples can be simultaneously amplified in a 96-well reaction plate, while slides for FA must be read individually. However, the per specimen cost of reagents and supplies required for the RT-PCR assays is about three times higher than for FA and the cost of equipment for the real-time PCR assays is about four times higher than for FA (PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System versus fluorescent microscope).",
