Malaria was diagnosed in 25.5% of non-EVD cases, and we consider our approach an appropriate strategy, providing a reasonable alternative diagnosis to EVD and avoiding unnecessary treatment. Although the median LoS for individuals with malaria was only 1 day, the upper range was 30 hours longer than that for patients with a FilmArray diagnosis. This was due to performing an EBOV RT-PCR 72 hours after symptom onset in patients from malaria endemic countries due to the high rates of EVD and malaria coinfection [9].",

First, our cohort was relatively small and the period of review restricted to a single season, which may influence the number, type, and activity of certain pathogens. Second, it was limited to a particular patient population, although this was reflective of the multinational HCWs and other patients referred to the facility. Third, a confounding factor may have been the relationship between the time of symptom onset and patient presentation, influencing discharge decisions. Finally, a note of caution must be applied regarding molecular test results as these do not distinguish between live or dead organisms or demonstrate antimicrobial sensitivities. Identifying the presence of a pathogen does not confirm infection, and asymptomatic individuals may shed organisms for prolonged periods. However, we used the FilmArray in a targeted manner in patients with symptoms consistent with active infection, which may account for the high number of positive and low number of negative results observed. Results must be interpreted in an appropriate clinical context with clinical microbiology advice, particularly when a multiplex system identifies several pathogens, which are of varying significance.",

Understanding the causes of non-EVD illness is important for planning future laboratory support to EVDTUs and staff health protection measures (eg, influenza vaccination and malaria chemoprophylaxis). Further studies are warranted to determine the applicability of these findings to an EVD outbreak in different contexts, which may also be relevant to other clinical settings and infectious pathogens.",
