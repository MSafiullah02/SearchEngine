            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly caused a pandemic. Recent reports showed that individuals with obesity may be more vulnerable to severe complications of COVID-19 by virtue of the increased risk of chronic diseases driven by obesity [1] . The reasons for this are not well known, but chronic inflammation is suspected to be one of the causes. Obesity is a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, which is characterized by increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion from adipose tissue and the infiltration of leukocytes, including macrophages, into the adipose tissue. Thus, this chronic inflammation impairs insulin signaling in adipocytes, causing insulin resistance, and contributing to the development of metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension [2] , which are well known comorbidities that adversely affect the outcome of patients with COVID-19. In addition, patients with severe COVID-19 commonly show cytokine storms, which refer to an excessive and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In particular, serum IL-6 levels in those with severe COVID-19 were significantly higher than in those with mild cases [1, 3] . Although most people with COVID-19 develop no symptoms or have only mild illness, the evidence shows that about 14% of COVID-19 patients develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and oxygen support, while 5% develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and multiorgan failure [4, 5] , and these are all related to inflammatory responses.",

This unfavorable hormone status leads to a dysregulation of the immune response and can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesityrelated complications [6] . In the basal state, individuals with obesity have a higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines. Under viral infection, obesity-related chronic inflammation causes reduced macrophage activation and blunts proinflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation [7] . The reduced macrophage activation by viral infection may explain the poor vaccination response in obese patients. Moreover, B-and T-cell responses are impaired in individuals with obesity with numerical and functional alterations of lymphocytes, and these alterations may increase susceptibility to viral infection. Thus, this dysregulated proinflammatory response contributes to the severe lung lesions seen during the COVID-19 pandemic [6] . Based on this mechanism, individuals with obesity who already have low-level chronic inflammation may be more vulnerable to cytokine storms by COVID-19 infection.",

Anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteroids, may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection, especially in those with impaired immune systems. Some proinflammatory cytokine antagonists (for example, IL-6 antagonists) can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and, thus, may eliminate adverse effects of cytokine storms without preventing the effects of other inflammatory cytokines in removing SARS-CoV-2 from the infected organs. A recent study showed that colchicine treatment had a beneficial effect in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome in reducing IL-6 [8] , which may translate to a beneficial effect in people with obesity and COVID-19 infection. However, anti-inflammatory medications, such as Janus kinase inhibitors, which were recently reported to treat COVID-19 patients, can inhibit a variety of inflammatory cytokines including interferon-\u03b1, which plays an important role in suppressing virus activity, and, thus, may not be suitable for treatment of inflammatory cytokine storms caused by COVID-19 [9] .",
