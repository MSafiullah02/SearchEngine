A convenience sample of ICNs was recruited nationally. The participants were aware of the study purposes and voluntarily agreed to take part, so their participation was voluntary and anonymous. Questionnaires were e-mailed 5 times to all members of the Korean Association of Infection Control Nurses and delivered in person to attendees of the Korean ICN's annual conference who agreed to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria included being an active ICN registered with the Korean Association of Infection Control Nurses and voluntarily consenting to participate in this study. Data were collected via e-mail and offline questionnaires from November 8, 2017, to February 2, 2018. Questionnaires were e-mailed to 399 ICNs, and 143 were returned (response rate = 35.8%); 300 offline questionnaires were distributed, and 250 were returned (response rate = 83.3%).

However, almost all items on the perception questionnaire showed lower scores than in a previous study where participants were RNs. Self-reported HH performance (78.3 \u00b1 24.2) was higher than that of others (HCWs) (75.2 \u00b1 15.5). These figures are lower than those reported in a previous study with RNs (88.2 \u00b1 11.0 and 86.0 \u00b1 11.0, respectively).13 Attitude about HH in our study had a relatively lower mean score (46.9 \u00b1 5.8) than in a previous study with RNs (50.5 \u00b1 5.5)13 and showed lowest scores for convenience and protectiveness of HH. Therefore, strategies to promote the convenience and protectiveness of HH products are needed to improve HH.1, 3\n,\n4 The mean HH role model score (39.2 \u00b1 6.0) was relatively lower than that in a previous study with RNs13 (46.9 \u00b1 3.3). ICNs considered the charge nurse, head nurse, and physician as important role models, apart from colleagues, to improve HH compliance, as in previous studies.20, 21 Infection control experience was significantly associated with HH role model and HH performance of HCWs (significantly lower in groups with <12 months of experience).",
