            "text": "The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has generated global concern given its rapid spread in multiple countries and fatal progression of the Coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) [1,2]. However, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases especially in the early phase of the infection have also been reported [3,4]. Since the spread of SARS-CoV-2 out of China, one of the main concerns on the diagnosis of this new virus has been the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic assays. So far, nucleic acid amplification testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples [5,6]. Molecular assays as previously demonstrated for epidemics caused by other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), are crucial for rapid application of infection control measures, case identification and contact tracing (6, 7). However, one of the major drawbacks of these assays is the need for viral nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens. Recently, DiaSorin S.p.A. (Gerenzano, Italy) has developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay) performed directly on clinical samples.",

The analytical sensitivity (i.e. the LOD, corresponding to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2-RNA detected with response probability of 95% for either S or ORF1ab) was determined by Probit regression model (Fig. 1\n). More in detail, the LOD for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9 to 3.8) log10 cp/mL (Fig. 1a) and 0.40 (CI: 0.2 to 1.5) TCID50/mL (Fig. 1b) for S; 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9 to 3.7) log10 cp/mL (Fig. 1c) and 0.4 (CI: 0.2 to 1.3) TCID50/mL (Fig. 1d) for ORF1ab. Consistent, although slightly better results, were obtained for LOD calculated on extracted viral RNA.

Results obtained from the two laboratories were all included in the study. All the 99 SARS-CoV-2 samples tested positive with the reference test showing median cycle threshold (Ct) of 24.2 (range 16.6-36.9), also resulted positive with Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay, with a clinical sensitivity of 100%. Notably, Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay was able to detect 8 additional positive samples resulted negative with Corman\u2019s method. In these samples, a median of 30.8 Ct (range 28.2-33.3) in FAM detector and 31.2 Ct (range 28.2\u201333.6) in JOE detector was observed, respectively. Concordance analysis showed an \u201calmost perfect\u201d agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being \u03ba = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980 (Table 3\n). Moreover, the performance of the assay in a different clinical specimen type, i.e. BAL, that is considered of utmost importance in patients with lower respiratory tract implication, was also evaluated: a total of 33 BAL samples were analysed in parallel with the Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay and Corman\u2019s method. For these samples, the Abbot m2000 extraction platform was used, due to temporary restriction of QIAsymphony\u00ae reagents (Table 4). While with BAL samples the reference method provided elevated number of invalid results (14 out of 33), with overall 12 positives out of 19 valid results, 33 out of 33 samples achieved a valid result with the Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay, providing 20 positives out of 33 valid results. The concordance among the 19 samples with valid results in both assays was 100% (12 positive and 7 negative).",

Prompt and rapid diagnosis are the main goals, particularly in the early phase of epidemics and are the first step towards limiting the propagation of the infection. In this scenario, we have evaluated the performances of the newly designed real-time RT-PCR Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay. Overall, the test is fast, easy-to-use, does not need extra-equipment such as centrifuges or an extraction system, and can be handled by laboratory personal with very little extra training for the procedures and interpretation of results. Furthermore, the simplicity of design and the all-in-one coupled with easy-to-use design, makes it suitable for the field settings, and for near-to-patient diagnosis.",

Notably, Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay showed a slightly higher sensitivity with respect of the reference test, identifying near 3% additional positive samples. An high performance of the test was also observed using different clinical specimens: among the BAL samples that were able to be analysed by both methods, a perfect agreement was observed; noteworthy, Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay was able to detect the virus in BAL samples resulted invalid with the reference method. The discrepancy in the processing capability between the two systems is attributable to the highly viscous composition of BAL, that could impair its accessibility to a traditional extraction method compared to a faster and easier sample processing method such as that used in the Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay. Moreover a 100% of clinical specificity was observed against swabs resulted positive to other viruses, particularly human coronaviruses, indicating no cross-reactivity with other similar viruses. Key advantages of this assay are simple operation procedures and high-speed of detection in just over an hour, which is significantly faster than the up to seven hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies. The lack of extraction reduces turnaround time (TAT) for the diagnosis of COVID -19, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.",
