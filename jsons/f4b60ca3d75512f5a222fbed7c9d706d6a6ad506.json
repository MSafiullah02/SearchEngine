The virus has a centrally situated nucleic acid, which is encased within a capsid consisting of a protein core. Viruses are obligatory intracellular microorganisms that live inside cells, using components of the nucleic acid and protein generating system of the host to replicate and trigger cell destruction leading to diseases. Alternatively, the host's defense mechanisms lead to cell destruction in an attempt to clear cells infected by the viruses. The nucleic acid is RNA or DNA, which may be single-stranded or double-stranded [1] . The pathophysiology of viral infections may be attributed to the degeneration and cellular necrosis of the infected cells, leading to local and systemic inflammatory responses. The body's defense mechanisms include phagocytosis, humoral and cell-mediated responses and the production of interferons [2] . Interferons prevent the local spread of viruses, whereas antibodies prevent viremia, ensure long-term immunity and sensitize infected cells to be destroyed by T-cells and macrophages [3, 4] . Cell-mediated immunity leads to an increase in cytotoxic cells that then release lymphokines, including interferon.",

The primary host defenses against virus infection are physical/chemical barriers to infection and the immune system [11] . Virus infection in humans usually evokes two types of immune response. The initial rapid-onset 'innate' response against the virus involves the synthesis of proteins, namely interferons, and the stimulation of 'natural killer (NK)' lymphocytes [12, 13] . In some cases, the innate response may be enough to prevent a wide spread infection. However, if the infection evolves beyond the first few rounds of viral replication, the 'adaptive immune response' comes into play [14] . The adaptive immune response itself has two components: The humoral response and the cellmediated response. Both of these components of the adaptive immune response result in the production of long lasting memory cells that provides immunity to successive infections by same virus. These extremely precise cell-surface detecting receptors detect the antigen or certain viral proteins specific to that virus [4] . This process leads to an immunological memory, which then forms the origin for vaccination [3] . The innate immune system provides universal host protection from infectious diseases. It identifies the presence of pathogens using numerous methods of detection. The major targets of innate immune recognition are viral nucleic acids. Generally, the innate immune system detects structural features of viral RNA and DNA that are distinct from the host nucleic acid [15, 16] .",

Subsequently, it leads to the activation of the adaptive immune response, which can offer a more directed, antigen-specific, and long-term antiviral immunity. The primary aim of the body's defense mechanism is to eradicate the infected cells. This is accomplished by cell-intrinsic mechanisms that are brought about by type-I interferons in the infected cells. It can also be implemented by cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells and CD8 T cells [17] . Prevention of entry of the virus into the host cell is an important protection process. Neutralizing antibodies primarily carry this out. Other methods that interfere with viral replication, gene expression and exit from the infected cells vary depending on the virus and the host. Acute phase proteins and the complement system play an active role in innate immune response. Leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells and NK T cells, are the principal innate immune cell types that respond to viral infection [14] . C-type lectins on their cell surface recognize viral protein or nucleic acid content and, in the case of NK and NK T cells, changes on the cell surfaces of infected cells [18] . These cells enter tissues invaded by these microorganisms from the plasma through the action of cytokines that are released during infection. The adaptive immune system displays two distinct cell types: B and T lymphocytes. On exposure to a virus, B-lymphocytes stimulate the release of a soluble form of antibody able to bind the circulating virions, effectively leading to eradication of the virus. An antiviral Blymphocyte response is effectively sensitive in preventing or limiting reinfection and forms the basis of vaccination against specific viruses [19] .",

This process of replication can take place rapidly or slowly over time. This progression over a time frame determines the rapidity of evolution of illness. In acute viral infections, the multiplication of the virus and the host response will result in eradicating the virus and clearing the infection or if the infection is overwhelming will lead to the severe sepsis or death of the host. The tissue injury caused by viruses at the site of infection is due to the cytotoxic injury of virus multiplication and the host's immune response to infection. In chronic infection, the time frame of virus multiplication in the host is usually assessed in weeks, months, or even years, with the host immune response spanning over prolonged periods. Viruses causing chronic and lasting infection have developed processes to subdue or alter the immune response whereby these viruses persist in the patient. The immune responses encountered both in acute and chronic viral infections can lead to tissue injury. The classic example of chronic viral infection leading to immune-mediated tissue destruction over years is hepatitis C cirrhosis. These immune responses, seen in a host of viral infections, may be responsible for the associated autoimmune diseases associated with certain viruses [20] .",

Influenza virus is transmitted via the aerial route and hence is responsible for large epidemics. The virulence and antigenicity of the virus, the immune condition of the host, and the environment all interact, conditioning person-to-person transmission of the disease [27] . Diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and tests, such as antigen determination tests, nucleic acid tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification or viral cultures.

CCHF virus has been detected in the sera of horses, donkeys, goats, cattle, sheep, and pigs in various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Birds may have a role in the transportation of CCHF virus-infected ticks between different countries. The major at-risk groups are farmers living in endemic areas. Hospital healthcare workers are at serious risk: 8.7% of healthcare workers who were exposed to infected blood and 33% of those who had a needlestick injury developed the disease. Laboratory methods include virus isolation, serological assays, and molecular assays. Immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) using specific monoclonal antibodies may enable virus visualization under microscopy.",

As with all herpesviruses, primary CMV infection remains latent lifelong and undergoes episodes of reactivation, and may progress to symptomatic disease. In the last decade, CMV reactivation has been reported in immunocompetent critically ill patients. The incidence is variable, depending on the diagnostic method used (culture or PCR), and ranges from 12-33% [60] . The incidence of active CMV disease was found to be high in a series of 242 immunocompetent patients subjected to ventilation for over 48 hours (16.1%) [61] . CMV should be suspected as the cause of VAP in the presence of persistent infiltrates, a lack of clinical improvement and negative bacterial cultures [62] . Reactivation of CMV occurs between days 14 and 21 of the ICU stay. Reactivation may begin in the lung parenchyma and is usually activated by sepsis. This process can cause a persistent increase in cytokine-mediated inflammatory response. Risk factors for reactivation are blood transfusion, age, previous hospitalization, prior corticosteroid use and burn injury. Several observational studies have shown an association between CMV infection in critically ill patients and poor clinical outcomes [63] .",

The limited availability of effective anti-viral agents or vaccines limits therapy. However, certain viruses do respond effectively to appropriate agents (e. g., HSV and VRZ to acyclovir, CCHF to ribavirin, CMV to ganciclovir). ECMO played an important role in improving survival globally in the recent H1N1 epidemic. Advances in HIV therapy provide new hope to the large population of AIDS patients worldwide. A similar hope can be seen for patients with chronic hepatitis B and C infection. In the ICU, healthcare workers need to be cautioned during epidemics of influenza and Ebola virus, ensuring that ICUs follow the necessary protocols to prevent transmission.
