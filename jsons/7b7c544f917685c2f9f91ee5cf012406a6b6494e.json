The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts. Now SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world. As a simple and effective method, people in the epidemic areas were asked to stay at home and reduce outgoing. But unless all suspected patients and close contacts of confirmed infections were quarantined, transmission among household members will still be an import route of transmission, especially in the areas with more family members. Data about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household contacts is now limited. In the report of Zunyou Wu, 10 20 provinces outside of Hubei in China found 1183 case clusters, 64% of the clusters have been within familial households. In another research on SARS-CoV-2 infected cases in Zhejiang province, China, 21 of 62 patients (34%) were associated with familial clusters. And previous works on other two coronavirus caused pneumonia epidemics reported secondary transmission rate among household contacts of 5% for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 10.2% for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 11 , 12 Our work showed a secondary transmission rate of 30% among household contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan city, which was similar with the data of Zhejiang province and much more severe than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV did. This is in accordance with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has caused infected cases in ever greater quantities and is spreading in a much higher speed than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. [13] [14] [15] [16] Based on the imported cases from Wuhan into other cities, the basic reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68. The epidemic doubling time was estimated to be 6.4 days. 17 In this work, as there were only 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 days between the onset of second infection and onset of third infection in households, we prefer to consider the second and third infections in households all as second-generation infections.",

By 29 February, 705 of 3,700 passengers and crew (19%) were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2. 18 , 19 Notably, this infection rate was achieved after an isolation of 14 days, even though the effect of isolation was partly hindered by the limited space on ship.

Based on the available evidence, without the results of serological studies, it is hard to tell if children are not susceptible.
