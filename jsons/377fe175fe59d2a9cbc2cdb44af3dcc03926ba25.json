In most systemic infections, renal involvement is a minor component of the illness, but in some, renal failure may be the presenting feature and the major problem in management. Although individual infectious processes may have a predilection to involve the renal vasculature, glomeruli, interstitium, or collecting systems, a purely anatomic approach to the classification of infectious diseases affecting the kidney is rarely helpful because most infections may involve several different aspects of renal function. In this chapter, a microbiologic classification of the organisms affecting the kidney is adopted.

In several tropical countries, glomerulonephritis (GN) accounts for up to 4% of pediatric hospital admissions; the incidence in temperate climates is 10-to 100-fold less. This difference might be explained by a complex interaction of several different factors, including nutrition, racial and genetically determined differences in immune responses, and exposure to infectious diseases.

In many conditions, a combination of these mechanisms may be operative.

Depending on the severity of the infection and the organism responsible, the renal involvement may vary from insignificant proteinuria to acute renal failure requiring dialysis. The organisms causing acute renal failure as part of systemic sepsis vary with age and geographic location and also differ in normal and immunocompromised children. In the neonatal period, group B streptococci, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes are the organisms usually . responsible. In older children, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. aureus account for most of the infections. In people who are immunocompromised, a wide range of bacteria are seen, and, similarly, in tropical countries other pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella species, and Pseudomonas pseudomallei, must be considered. Where H. influenzae type B vaccine has been introduced, however, the incidence of severe systemic infections due to this organism has shown a sharp fall. Systemic sepsis usually presents with nonspecific features: fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and evidence of skin and organ underperfusion. The pathophysiology of renal involvement in systemic sepsis is multifactorial (1, 2) . Hypovolemia with diminished renal perfusion is the earliest event and is a consequence of the increased vascular permeability and loss of plasma from the intravascular space. Hypovolemia commonly coexists with depressed myocardial function because of the myocardial depressant effects of endotoxin or other toxins. The renal vasoconstrictor response to diminished circulating volume and reduced cardiac output further reduces glomerular filtration, and oliguria is thus a consistent and early event in severe sepsis (1, 3) . A number of vasodilator pathways are activated in sepsis, including Nitric Oxide and the Kinin pathways. This may lead to inappropriate dilatation of vascular beds. Vasodilation of capillary beds leading to warm shock is common in adults with sepsis due to Gram-negative organisms but is less commonly seen in children, in whom intense vasoconstriction is the usual response to sepsis. If renal underperfusion and vasoconstriction are persistent and severe, the reversible prerenal failure is followed by established renal failure with the characteristic features of vasomotor nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis. Other mechanisms of renal damage in systemic sepsis include direct effects of endotoxin and other toxins on the kidney, and release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and proteolytic enzymes (3) . Nitric oxide (NO) is postulated to play a key role in the pathophysiology of renal failure in sepsis. Whether the renal effects of increased NO are beneficial or harmful remains unclear. Trials of selective NO synthetase inhibition did not offer any advantages over saline resuscitation (4) . NO in endotoxemia is possibly beneficial because it maintains renal blood flow and glomerular filtration. Activation of coagulation is an important component of the pathophysiology of septic shock and may contribute to renal impairment. Activation of multiple prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic pathways occurs, together with downregulation of antithrombotic mechanisms such as the protein C pathway. Treatment with Activated protein C has been shown to improve outcome of adult septic shock, but has not been confirmed to have benefit in pediatric sepsis, and may carry a risk of bleeding particularly in infants (5) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 69, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1286, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1289, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1811, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1814, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2702, "end": 2705, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2995, "end": 2998, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3615, "end": 3618, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Systemic Sepsis and Septic Shock"}, {"text": "The renal findings early in septic shock are oliguria, with high urine/plasma urea and creatinine ratios, low urine sodium concentration, and a high urine/plasma osmolarity ratio.

Passive trapping of circulating immune complexes may be involved, but the circulating immune complexes containing HBsAg are usually larger than would be expected to penetrate the basement membrane. HBsAg and HBcAg are anionic and are therefore unlikely to penetrate the glomerular capillary wall. In contrast, HBeAg forms smaller complexes with anti-HBe antibodies and may readily penetrate the GBM. This may explain the observation that HBeAg in the circulation frequently correlates with the severity of the disease (110) . An alternative mechanism for immunemediated glomerular injury is the trapping of HBV antigens by antibody previously deposited in the kidney. Anti-HBe antibodies are cationic and may readily localize in the glomerulus and subsequently bind circulating antigen and complement. The third possibility is that the depositions of HBV and antibodies are consequences of glomerular injury by cellular mechanisms or autoantibodies. Little evidence supports this view at present (110) . A transgenic mouse model of HBV-associated nephropathy has been developed, in which HBsAg and HBcAg is expressed in liver and kidney, particularly tubular epithelial cells, without viral replication. In these mice, gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of acute-phase proteins, particularly C3, although measurable serum C3 levels were reduced.
