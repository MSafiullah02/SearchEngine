            "text": "To the Editor C oronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to be highly contagious, and Singapore has seen a significant rise in the number of new cases. 1 It is therefore likely that there will be patients with COVID-19 who might require urgent surgery. There are many expert opinions and practical guidelines in the literature regarding the perioperative management of COVID-19 patients. [2] [3] [4] However, the implementation of these guidelines will require local adaptation to be effective. 5 For example, our institution's operating room (OR) complex does not have a negative pressure OR to contain aerosol contamination, which necessitates new workflows and processes to minimize movement through OR doors. To assess the effectiveness of these adaptations and uncover latent hazards, we designed and implemented high-fidelity in situ simulations (ISS) to replicate the scenarios of COVID-19 patients needing surgery. We present the findings from our ISS experience.",

            "text": "For each ISS, participants were organized into OR teams in the minimum number required to conduct surgery safely. They included surgeons from the relevant disciplines, scrub nurses, anesthesiologists, anesthesia nurses, OR attendants, environmental services, porters, and allied health professionals. The observers were resource personnel from each of the above-mentioned professions who had developed OR workflows and from other surgical disciplines not involved in the simulation. The participants and observers engaged in tabletop exercises before each ISS to discuss the workflow and processes. Debriefing was conducted at the end of each ISS. It focused on the critical review of 7 chronological key phases: notification of surgery, organization of OR preparation, donning of personal protection equipment (PPE), transport of the patient to OR, conduct of anesthesia and surgery, postsurgery doffing of OR team, and transport of patient out of OR. Each debriefing led to further improvements in the workflow and processes, which were tested in the subsequent simulation. A summary of the observations, improvements, and results in the 7 key phases is shown in the Table. We recommend using repeated ISS involving different surgical specialties in the OR to uncover logistical issues and improve evolving work processes before the actual management of surgery in COVID-19 patients. The ISS should encompass the workflow in entirety: from notification of the OR of planned surgery in a COVID-19 patient to the safe transfer of the patient out of the OR complex after surgery. In our experience, the participants and observers became more familiar with the infection control measures through the ISS. Pre-and post-ISS surveys also indicated increase in scores for confidence in roles. The debriefings highlighted gaps in the processes and generated solutions that could be tested in subsequent ISS for suitability. Through our ISS, we developed cognitive aids and checklists, improved our workflows, defined various roles and responsibilities, and reconfigured the donning and doffing spaces and protocols. These interventions increased the capability and confidence of our OR team to care for a COVID-19 patient presenting for surgery.",

Donning of PPE Observation Donning area was crowded with all members of the OR team donning the PPE at the same time. Some OR team members had minor breaches in PPE. Improvement Reconfiguration of the donning area into separate stations, arranged in sequential order for each stage of donning. Each station had cognitive aids and mirrors for self-checks. Order of priority for donning was established to reduce crowding. A designated nurse checked the integrity of PPE of each OR team member before entry into the OR Result There was order in PPE donning process with significantly reduced amount of time required for each OR member. Breaches in PPE donning were eliminated. Observation Unable to provide a separate isolated route from the patient's ward to the OR without risk of contamination to the environment Improvement The institution's Environmental Services was engaged to coordinate the transfer. They directed the hospital's human traffic and provided decontamination of the route after transfer. The patient was protected with a surgical mask. If high-flow oxygen therapy was used, the aerosols would be contained within a clear plastic barrier draped over the patient and his bed. Result Contamination to the environment was reduced during transfer to the OR. PAPR prevented the use of surgical microscopes. Management of PAPR battery failure involved multiple movements in and out of OR for doffing and redonning. Repeated opening and closing of OR access doors due to requests for items or for communication caused breaches in infection control measures. Improvement PPE was labeled with designated roles and names for identification. White boards with markers were used for written communication. Closed-loop communication with read back was emphasized. Speaker phones were installed for communication with members outside the OR. Surgeons would use alternatives such as surgical loupes instead of microscopes. Direct exchange of PAPR battery without doffing was tested. Checklist for items required during surgery was edited. An additional nurse coordinator would consolidate all items requested intraoperatively. Result Improved communication that resulted in faster work processes and reduced risk of errors. Process of battery change for PAPR battery failure was faster. Consolidated requests resulted in reduced number of times OR doors were opened. Postsurgery doffing of OR team Observation Limited space in doffing area resulted in cross contamination of OR members during doffing.",
