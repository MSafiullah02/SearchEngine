Although usually characteristic, both macroscopic and histological alterations were not always indicative of FIP. Therefore, differential diagnoses can sometimes not be readily excluded by routine post-mortem histopathology, and the diagnosis of FIP has to be confirmed by immunohistological demonstration of coronavirus antigen within the lesions (Tammer et al., 1995). We performed a systematic examination on the various lesions in naturally infected animals in order to further investigate cellular composition and content of immunohistologically detectable coronavirus antigen, and to detect the production of coronavirus-specific antibodies in situ.",
