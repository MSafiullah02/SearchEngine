Outside of etiologic studies, the vast majority of patients never have a pathogen diagnosed as the cause of their pneumonia. Although physicians are generally quite comfortable with empiric therapy, the need to guess and fear of missing an important pathogen inevitably leads to a broader than necessary spectrum of coverage, particularly in the setting of more severe illness.",

The most common approach has been the use of pathogen-specific assays for use in urine, blood, or sputum. Although serologic tests based on detecting antibodies to specific pathogens were the predominant technique for decades, they all have limitations in early disease before an adaptive immune response being constituted as well as issues of cross-reactivity reducing specificity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques are now the primary modality for the detection of atypical pathogens in most settings. More recently, there has been the development of multipathogen detection platforms that have become used increasingly in the setting of pneumonia.",

There are definitely clinical features that are seen more commonly in some of the atypical pathogens than with disease owing to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Examples include erythema multiforme with M pneumoniae, diarrhea with L pneumophila, and rhinorrhea with influenza. However, there is ample evidence that no set of clinical symptoms or signs has sufficient predictive ability to rule in or out any atypical or viral pathogens, especially M pneumoniae 7 and Legionella. [8] [9] [10] A number of nonmicrobiological tests have also been proposed as being able to discriminate between \"atypical\" and \"typical\" pathogens, including the peripheral white cell count and procalcitonin. Although peripheral white cell counts do tend to be lower in viral infections compared with bacterial infections, this is not particularly discriminating at an individual patient level and certainly not accurate enough to use to determine empiric therapy. 11 Procalcitonin seems to be more accurate than white cell count, 11 but does not discriminate between atypical bacterial infection and viral infection 12 and may be misleading, particularly in critically ill patients or in patients with bacterial and viral coinfection. 13 A definitive diagnosis based on detecting the infection pathogen(s), therefore, remains critical if we are to improve the accuracy of empiric therapy.",

            "text": "Because Legionellae will not grow on standard culture media, the diagnosis has traditionally rested on either positive serology or a positive urinary antigen test. Both of these tests have significant limitations. In the case of serology, 20% or more of patients with culture-proven Legionella infection do not ever seroconvert, 19, 20 and seroconversion may take months, requiring testing out to at least 2 months if not longer. 21 Urinary antigen testing is quite specific, but will only reliably detection L pneumophila serogroup 1, and usually serogroup 6, but in many areas other species (particularly Legionella longbeachae and Legionella micdadei) are more predominant. Despite these limitations, urinary antigen testing for Legionella is recommended in all patients with severe CAP (ie, admitted to the intensive care unit) for both diagnostic and public health reasons. 22 The mainstay of diagnosis of Legionella infection has been from one or more of direct antigen detection or nucleic acid detection in respiratory secretions. Direct fluorescent antigen detection was developed in the pre-PCR era but have now largely been replaced by PCR because the latter is more sensitive, less technician dependent, and easier to automate. PCR tests for Legionella are a mix of \"home-grown\" assays and commercially available products, with reported sensitivity and specificity (using all other tests as the gold standard) in the range of 91% to 99% and 94% to 99%, respectively. 23 Because PCR tests for Legionella are generally able to detect all species, 24 not surprisingly they have a greater degree of sensitivity than urinary antigen testing. 23, 25 There is, however, a reasonable argument for performing both urinary antigen testing and PCR on respiratory secretions because there is an increased diagnostic yield from this approach. 26 It is worth noting that both nasopharyngeal aspirates [27] [28] [29] and throat swabs 15 have substantially lower yields for the detection of Legionella by PCR, but may be of use in patients in whom it is not possible to get spontaneous or induced sputum samples.",

A number of other Chlamydophila-like pathogens (such as Parachlamydia acanthamoebae and Simkania negevensis) also been suggested as potential causes of the 50% or more of cases of CAP where no pathogen is identified. 36, 37 The specificity of positive serology for C pneumoniae has also been questioned, because studies using PCR-based diagnosis typically find much lower rates of infection than earlier serology-based studies and a large variety of assays with different performance characteristics have been used. 38 As with Mycoplasma, in early disease Chlamydophila serology is often negative making PCR a superior diagnostic test. 39 Unlike Legionella and Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila cannot be detected by 16S-based PCR assays. Because culture of Chlamydophila is difficult and has a low yield, it is rarely done 40 ; therefore, PCR assays that have been developed are generally compared with serologic tests, with their known limitations as discussed. The true sensitivity of PCR for Chlamydophila species is, therefore, unknown. However the reported specificity of most assays is well over 95% 41 and, therefore, a positive result in the right clinical context should be acted on.",

Complicating the assessment of the usefulness of these assays is that the performance seems to vary between influenza strains and, unfortunately, during the H1N1 09 pandemic they were less than optimal. 43-47 A recent metaanalysis of 159 published studies of rapid influenza tests found the pooled sensitivity, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to be 62%, 98%, 34%, and 38%, respectively. 47 Not surprisingly, given these data, there is little evidence that rapid influenza tests are currently used by clinicians to alter patient management. 48 However, this is a rapidly changing field and more recent publications suggest that there are incremental improvements with a range of sensitivity from 68% to 79% and specificity of 99% to 100%.

Unlike bacterial pathogens, the constant genomic shifts in influenza A do affect the performance of assays and they need to be revalidated constantly as new strains appear. 53 A variety of point-of-care platforms have been developed for detecting influenza, of which the GeneXpert system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) is perhaps so far the best studied. 54 GeneXpert is an \"all-in-one\" platform requiring minimal technical expertise, and is a potential point-of-care platform for diagnosing influenza. A sputum sample is placed in a cartridge that plugs into the platform without the need for further processing or expert microbiological assistance. With a turnaround time of less than 2 hours, results can be available fast enough to impact on empiric therapy. This system has been evaluated extensively for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, where it has been proven to have excellent sensitivity and specificity. 55 The influenza A and B GeneXpert assay has been evaluated in comparison to a number of commercially available rapid antigen tests and PCR tests and found to have excellent sensitivity (97% \u00c0100%) and specificity (99%-100%). [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] The potential clinical usefulness has been studied in the emergency department setting, again with good performance and efficiency. 61, 62 Point-of-care testing for influenza is a highly competitive area with potential new products regularly entering the market offering greater speed, lower cost, and/or greater accuracy (for example [63] [64] [65] [66] ).",

PCRelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry holds particular promise given that it can identify minute quantities and mixtures of nucleic acids from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. The performance of PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for detecting influenza in clinical samples seems at least as good as conventional PCR assays. 73 A single study from Taiwan indicates that PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has promise for the detection of multiple viruses in the setting of respiratory tract infection but this was done retrospectively rather than in real time. 74 A different use of mass spectrometry, matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is also a protein/peptide diagnostic tool that has been shown to have usefulness in identifying microorganisms at a species level. MALDI-TOF-MS has been assessed predominantly as a means of rapidly identifying the identity of both bacteria and their bacterial products from positive blood cultures, up to 24 hours faster than conventional methods. A comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of MALDI-TOF-MS with liquid chromatography MS for influenza A, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus suggested the latter may be superior. 75 A potential and significant limitation of current MALDI-TOF-MS is that when a large mixture of bacteria are present, as occurs more commonly in hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-acquired pneumonia, the sensitivity and specificity become suboptimal. 76",

These recent technologies allow sequencing of DNA and RNA much more quickly and cheaply than the previously used Sanger sequencing (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). To date, there are few data on the applicability of nextgeneration sequencing to immediate clinical care, but it has been particularly useful in diagnosing new and/or novel pathogens for which there are no available assays.",

Increasing focus on point-of-care testing, or at least rapid enough turnaround time to influence initial clinical management, has driven development of a host of new platforms and technologies that are likely to change the way we manage pneumonia over the coming decade.",
