My technique involved juxtaposing psychoanalytic material from a survivor's son with that from a survivor mother, and extrapolating how pain in the mother might be conveyed to the son, resulting in altered mental processes that reflected the mother's suffering.",

This approach recognizes the essential reconfiguring and recontextualizing attributes of all mnemonic processes and the dual possibility that traumatic intrusions will constrict the play space, with traumatic foreclosures and freezings of the metaphoric process being contributed by either participant. All psychoanalysis potentially suffers from the imposition of an inflexible metaphor from the analyst, reflecting his or her theoretical orientation; all analysis needs to deal with the playful potentials and constrictions that the analysand's experience, cognitive style, and self/theoretical orientation convey. When analyst and analysand are inclined to favor overlapping metaphoric pruning for either similarly traumatically tutored or similarly theoretically tutored Anlagen, then the analytic play space is maximally constricted, and the possibilities of the analysand's learning about him-or herself and ways of processing meaning are similarly ceilinged.",

            "text": "Clinical observation leads to the unmistakable conclusion that psychological trauma may result in a failure to recategorize or recontextualize memory. The inability to recontextualize memory determines whether a given experience will prove to be traumatic. As we have different methods at our disposal with which to recategorize memory, individuals will react to trauma in their own particular way, so the effect of a given environmental trauma is variable and unpredictable. When there is an inability to recontextualize memory, the experience of the present, the here and now, will be pervaded by memories of the past. In this fashion, trauma will constrict the complexity of consciousness. The process of the retrieval of traumatic memories gives further support to the hypothesis that an unconscious metaphoric process is operative in the waking state. As the critic and novelist Cynthia Ozick writes, \"Metaphor [like the Delphic Oracle] is also a priest of interpretation, but what it interprets is memory\" (1991) . When metaphor is the interpreter of traumatic memories, it interprets with the aid of metonymy (a part substituting for the whole) and metaphoric memorial categories are evoked by metonymic associations. But trauma can be self-sustaining, as trauma will degrade the metaphoric process; here the metaphoric process transfers meaning from the past to the present without transformation, and as a consequence, imagination is constricted. The past becomes a template for the present, creating a loss of ambiguity in the experience of the here and now; there is an absence of the customary play of similarity and difference. In experiential terms, this means that the present is conflated with the past. [pp. 38-39, italics in original] The neurolinguistic-affective notion of metaphoric fluidity employed by Modell, with its attendant capacities to recontextualize and recategorize memory, corresponds, I believe, to what might be called playing with \"full-deck\" capacity (Herzog and O'Connell, unpublished) -the emphasis on the play and its deformation after trauma reflecting my work as a child and adult analyst, and constituting a phenomenological description of what Modell set out to describe in terms of cognitive process and neuropsychological underpinnings. I have described the ways in which, in the presence of traumatic stimulation (both direct and transmitted), the play function shifts to the left (a model borrowed from hematology): from displacement to enactment to interactive enactment. * * * * * * * * Ilany Kogan, in her characteristically creative, careful, and compassionate analytic work, shows us how she and her patient Nurit identified foreclosed and frozen metaphors and reconstructed a narrative that sought to explain seemingly varied libidinal, aggressive, and narcissistic availability and the patient's mother's capacity to recognize Nurit for herself. The analyst is careful to identify the ways in which an analytically useful transferential repetition could be tolerated and recognized by both parties, as well as the constraining variables that obtained in both the transference and countertransference. She also cogently details the way in which aggression as a forbidden and Nazi-identified modality was proscribed from the treatment as a form of interactive enactment (play in which the analyst has to be a particular way) and the process by which it found its way back into the analytic play.",

Herzog 1982; J. M. Herzog 2001) . The father plays with his child by asking the child to match him, whereas the mother usually matches the child. This need to gauge and take the measure of the other, as well as to manage the upset and intrusion of another's agenda, is of vital importance to the child, resulting in growth-promoting alterations in brain capacities and behavioral possibilities.

And so we make steady, albeit very slow, progress in recognizing what he calls his \"brain state,\" which confounds the historical past with the here-and-now present. Dr. B is able to recognize that he has had an experience of conflating past and present in Singapore, and that this has affected his capacity to think with his customary creativity and playfulness. He can acknowledge that he and I have learned a lot about this form of indisposition. He cannot, however, free himself from the thought that his wife intended to increase his anxiety, or that I should have been able to protect him from this experience.

Dr. B always prided himself on his own capacity to manage, and this he did with extraordinary, even driven, brilliance. He came to see me after he was not awarded a Nobel prize that everyone felt to have been his due. His response was to feel crushed and as though he could not get up from bed.

My son Noah Herzog and 1 (Herzog 1997) have hypothesized that post-traumatic ablation of the self-other internal representational world results in the subsequent construction of an exoskeleton of self-structure. We use this term because such self-structure remains interactively contingent and cannot be fully internalized. Continuous efforts to reach the other and an absolute requirement for adequate reciprocation are mandatory.",

Furthermore, we have hypothesized that Celan's suicide, as well as Primo Levi's and Jerzsy Kozincki's, reflects the dilemma of the creative artist who, following massive trauma, establishes a creatively \"desperate dialogue with a receptive you\"-the audience-and then cannot survive when the audience turns away or loses interest. When the analyst enters into such an interactive enactment with the massively traumatized patient, a promise is made: \"I shall not extract myself knowingly. 1 shall fight with you and for you in the modality that your pain requires until the battle is won-until you have reclaimed your own modulated aggression and can fight on your own and tell me that 1 am no longer a required comrade in arms.\"",

He needs me to strengthen his psychic osteoblasts and to inhibit his psychic osteoclasts until he resumes these functions. He needs to restore his metaphoric capacity to full-deck functioning, thus keeping his bone structure and not turning into a bowl of jelly. Ms. Kogan entered into such a successful play encounter with Nurit, and Nurit emerged better able to love, work, and play. This is not only good analysis, but a profound example of how the very good analyst helps the analysand return to playing with a full deck.",
