We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from eight large phagedisplayed Fab, scFv and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from high-titer intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge (10 5 plaque forming units). Another antibody, VH ab5 did not compete with hACE2 and ab1, and did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 although its affinity was comparable to that of ab1. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.",

However, another potent antibody, m102.4, against henipavirusses was additionally affinity matured from its predecessor selected from smaller library (size ~10 10 clones) from 10 individuals (7, 13) . Thus, to generate high affinity and safe mAbs we constructed eight very large (size ~ 10 11 clones each) naive human antibody libraries in Fab, scFv or VH format using PBMCs from 490 individuals total obtained before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Four of the libraries were based on single human VH domains where CDRs (except CDR1 which was mutagenized or grafted) from our other libraries were grafted as previously described (14) .",

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein (S) to enter into host cells. The S receptor binding domain (RBD) binds to its receptor, the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2), thus initiating series of events leading to virus entry into cells (15, 16) . We have previously characterized the function of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and identified its RBD which is stable in isolation (17). The RBD was then used as an antigen to pan phage displayed antibody libraries; we identified potent antibodies (5, 8) more rapidly and the antibodies were more potent than when we used whole S protein or S2 (unpublished). In addition, the SARS-CoV RBD based immunogens are highly immunogenic and elicit neutralizing antibodies which protect against SARS-CoV infections (18). Thus, to identify SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, we generated two variants of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (aa 330-532) (Fig.   S1 ) and used them as antigens for panning of our eight libraries.",

This implies that ab1-like antibodies could be elicited relatively quickly by using RBD-based immunogens especially in some individuals with na\u00efve mature B cells expressing the germline predecessors of ab1. This is in contrast to the highly mutated broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies that require long maturation times, are difficult to elicit and their germline predecessors cannot bind native HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (21, 22). The RBD of the MERS-CoV S protein was previously shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies (23, 24). For SARS-CoV-2 only a few somatic mutations would be sufficient to generate potent neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD which is a major difference from the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 which requires complex maturation pathways (21, 25-28). The germline-like nature of the newly identified mAb ab1 also suggests that it has excellent developability properties that could accelerate its development for prophylaxis and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection (29).",

However, in the unlikely case of mutations that decrease the ab1 binding to RBD it can be used in combination with other mAbs including those we identified or in bi(multi)specific formats to prevent infection of such SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

The RBD domain (residues 330-532) and S1 domain (residues 14-675) and ACE2 (residues 18-740) genes were cloned into plasmid which carries a CMV promotor with an intron, human IgG1 Fc region and Woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to generate the RBD-Fc, S1-Fc and ACE2-Fc expression plasmids. The RBD-avi-his protein with an avi tag followed by a 6\u00d7His tag at C-terminal was subcloned similarly. These proteins were expressed with Expi293 expression system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified with protein A resin (GenScript) and by Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Fab CR3022 antibody gene with a His tag was cloned into pCAT2 plasmid (developed in house) for expression in HB2151 bacteria and purified with Ni-NTA resin.

To evaluate the efficacy of IgG1 ab1 in vivo we used transgenic mice which express human ACE2 (20). The mice were administered 0.3 mg of IgG1 ab1 or negative control 15 hours prior to intranasal infection with 10 5 plague forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2. No weight loss was observed over the course of the two-day infection. Lung tissue was homogenized in PBS and virus replication assessed by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells. Replication competent virus was not detected in four of the five mice which were treated with IgG1 ab1 (Figure 5). All six control mice and one of the treated mice had more than 10 4 PFU per lung (Figure 5). The difference between the IgG1 ab1 treated group and the control group is significant (p = 0.0113). This result shows clear evidence of a preventive effect of IgG1 ab1 in vivo. The reason for absence of virus neutralization in one of the mice is unclear but may be due to individual variation in antibody transfer from the peritoneal cavity where it was administered to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Our previous experiments with transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 and treated with two different doses of m336 (0.1 and 1 mg per mouse) showed similar lack of protection of one",

The na\u00efve human antibody phage display libraries were made based on the antibody cDNA from 490 healthy donors peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) and splenocytes. The Fab and scFv libraries were constructed by randomly pairing antibody VH and VL gene, and the VH libraries -by grafting CDRs into stable VH scaffolds. These libraries contain very large transformants (size for each ~10 11 ) and are highly diverse (unpublished). For panning, the libraries were preabsorbed on streptavidin-M280-Dynabeads in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and incubated with 50 nM biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Phage particles binding to biotinylated antigen were separated from the phage library using streptavidin-M280-Dynabeads and a magnetic separator (Dynal). After washing for 20 times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and another 20 times with 1 ml of PBS, bound phage particles were eluted from the beads using 100 mM triethanolamine followed by neutralization with 1 M, pH 7.5 Tris-HCl. For the 2 nd round of panning, 10 nM (2 nM for the 3 rd round) of biotinylated antigen was used as antigen. After the 3 rd round of panning against 2 nM biotinylated antigen, 96 individual clones were screened for binding to RBD-Fc fusion protein by phage ELISA.

Antibody affinities and avidities were analyzed by the biolayer interferometry BLItz (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA). For affinity measurements, protein A biosensors (ForteBio: 18-5010) were coated with RBD-Fc for 2 min and incubated in DPBS (pH = 7.4) to establish baselines. 125 nM, 250 nM and 500 nM VH and Fab were used for association. For avidity measurements, RBD-Fc was biotinylated with EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) (RBD-Fc-Bio). Streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio: 18-5019) were coated with RBD-Fc-Bio for 2 min and incubated in DPBS (pH = 7.4) to establish baselines. 50 nM, 100 nM and 200 nM IgG1 ab1 and VH-Fc ab5 were chosen for association. The association was monitored for 2 min and then the antibody allowed to dissociate in DPBS for 4 min. The ka and kd were derived from the sensorgrams fitting and used for Kd calculation. Flow Cytometry Analysis. Full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with native signal peptide replaced by the CD5 signal peptide were codon-optimized and synthesized by IDT. S gene was subcloned into our in-house mammalian cell expression plasmid, which were used to transiently transfect 293T cells cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 1% P/S. The transient expression level is tested by FACS staining using the recombinant hACE2-Fc, IgG1 CR3022 and IgG1 ab1. For the determination of binding avidity of IgG1 ab1 and hACE2-Fc to the cell surface S, quantitative FACS was performed by using the 48 h post transfection cells based on standard procedures. Briefly, 5 folds serially diluted antibodies or hACE2-Fc with highest concentration of 1 \u03bcM were added into 1\u00d710 6 cells and incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min followed by 3 times washing using PBS + 0.5% BSA buffer (PBSA buffer). Then cells were resuspended to 100 \u00b5l PBSA buffer followed by addition of 1 \u00b5l PE conjugated antihuman Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Cells then was washed by PBSA for 3 times and then analyzed by flow cytometry using BD LSR II (San Jose, CA). The gating of PE-A+ population was performed by FlowJo_V10_CL. The concentrations at which IgG1 ab1 or hACE2-Fc achieved 50% PE-A+ cells (EC50) was obtained by fitting using the equation of \"[agonist] vs. response --variable slope (four parameter)\" in the Graphpad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization Assay. The standard live virus-based microneutralization (MN) assay was used as previously described (9, 32-34). Briefly, serially three-fold and duplicate dilutions of individual monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates with a final volume of 60 \u03bcl per well before adding 120 infectious units of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in 60 \u03bcl to individual wells. The plates were mixed well and cultured at room temperature for 2 h before transferring 100 \u03bcl of the antibody-virus mixtures into designated wells of confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates. Vero E6 cells cultured with medium with or without virus were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. Additionally, Vero E6 cells treated with the MERS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing m336 mAb (5) were included as additional controls. After incubation at 37 o C for 4 days, individual wells were observed under the microcopy for the status of virus-induced formation of cytopathic effect. The efficacy of individual mAbs was expressed as the lowest concentration capable of completely preventing virus-induced cytopathic effect in 100% of the wells.",

Evaluation of IgG1 ab1 Protective Efficacy in a hACE2 Mouse Model of Infection. Human ACE2 transgenic 6-9 week old C3B6 mice were treated intraperitoneally with 0.3 mg of antibody (5 mice) or negative controls (6 mice) 15 hours prior to intranasal infection with 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. No weight loss was observed over the course of the two-day infection. Lung tissue was homogenized in PBS and virus replication assessed by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells. The assay limit of detection was 100 PFU.Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). For evaluation of aggregation propensity, IgG1-ab1 were buffer-changed to DPBS and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. The concentration was adjusted to 2 mg/mL; ~500 \u03bcL samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. On day 0, day 1 and day 6, samples were taken out for DLS measurement on Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN3600 (Malvern Instruments Limited, Westborough, MA) to determine the size distributions of protein particles. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL chromatography (GE Healthcare, Cat. No. 28990944) was used. The column was calibrated with protein molecular mass standards of Ferritin (Mr 440 000 kDa), Aldolase (Mr 158 000 kDa), Conalbumin (Mr 75 000 kDa), Ovalbumin (Mr 44 000 kDa), Carbonic anhydrase (Mr 29 000 kDa), Ribonuclease A (Mr 13 700 kDa). ~150 ul filtered proteins (1.5 mg/ml) in PBS were used for analysis. Protein was eluted by DPBS buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Computational Analysis of Antibody Sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST tool (37) was used to perform immunogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs. The unrooted circular phylogram tree of our scFv binders was constructed by using the neighbor joining methods through CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0 (https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com). The RBD sequences were obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/. Liabilities were evaluated online (opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/TAP.php) (38). Membrane Proteome Array Specificity Testing Assay. Integral Molecular, Inc. (Philadelphia, PA) performed specificity testing of IgG1 ab1 using the Membrane Proteome Array (MPA) platform. The MPA comprises 5,300 different human membrane protein clones, each overexpressed in live cells from expression plasmids that are individually transfected in separate wells of a 384-well plate (39). The entire library of plasmids is arrayed in duplicate in a matrix format and transfected into HEK-293T cells, followed by incubation for 36 h to allow protein expression. Before specificity testing, optimal antibody concentrations for screening were determined by using cells expressing positive (membrane-tethered Protein A) and negative (mock-transfected) binding controls, followed by flow cytometric detection with an Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Based on the assay setup results, ab1 (20 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the MPA. Binding across the protein library was measured on an iQue3 (Ann Arbor, MI) using the same fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. To ensure data validity, each array plate contained positive (Fc-binding; SARS-CoV-2 S protein) and negative (empty vector) controls. Identified targets were confirmed in a second flow cytometric experiment by using serial dilutions of the test antibody. The identity of each target was also confirmed by sequencing. Ethics statement. Human ACE2 transgenic C3B6 mice (6-9 weeks old) were used for all experiments.
