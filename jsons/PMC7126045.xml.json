            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a single-strained negative-sense RNA virus that has been widely used as a vector for vaccine development [1], [2]. Recombinant VSV can accommodate large and multiple foreign genes in its genome that are expressed at high levels [3] and confer advantages over other RNA viral vectors. Due to its potent capabilities in triggering cellular, humoral, and mucosal immunities in animals, even after a single administration, recombinant VSV has been studied as a vaccine vector not only for preventing vesicular stomatitis disease in livestock [4], but a number of human pathogens including: Influenza virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, and Hepatitis C virus [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. However, VSV is a notoriously infectious agent that not only produces acute disease, such as vesicular lesions in cattle, swine and horses, but neurotoxicity in experimental animals, including primates and mice [10], [11], [12]. Therefore, modifications are needed to improve the safety of VSV before it can be applied clinically as a replication competent vector.",

The mRNAs encode five structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N); phosphoprotein (P), which is a cofactor of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L); matrix protein (M); and attachment glycoprotein (G) [12]. M and G proteins are both primary pathogenic determinants of VSV [13], [14]. The M protein is a multi-functional protein involved in virus assembly, budding and pathogenesis [15], [16], and capable of inhibiting the transport of host mRNAs out of the nucleus significantly inhibiting type I interferon (IFN) signaling [17]. The G protein is responsible for viral binding to the host receptor and entry of VSV into host cells and its cytoplasmic domain is considered to play an important role in viral budding and packaging [18], [19], [20].",

Another attenuation strategy is dependent upon truncation within the C-terminal region of the G protein (VSV-G\u039428) that significantly impacts viral budding and packaging efficiency [22]. In vivo, however, VSV M protein mutant proved to be only moderately attenuated in experimental infections [16], [21], whereas there is currently no information available if recombinant VSV with truncated G protein is safe or not when animals challenged with high dose of the mutant virus.",

At 24 h p.i., 1% crystal violet was used to stain Vero cells, whereas A549 cells were stained 48 h p.i. Plaques were first scanned with Gel Imager (Tanon-1600R, Tanon, Shanghai, China) under bright light and then individual plaques were viewed and photographed under 4\u00d7 magnification using a microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera. The mean plaque size was determined by measuring the area of each plaque in each group using Nikon NIS-Elements BR software (Nikon).",

With the development of molecular technology, the construction of recombinant viruses based on reverse genetics, have become common for developing novel viral vectors. VSV is a promising vector for both vaccination and oncolysis, but still has not been applied clinically. One of the main reasons lies in its potential pathogenesis in humans and animals.

Thus, VSV\u0394M51 was attenuated in vivo. On the other hand, VSV is an enveloped virus that is released via budding from host cell membranes. Previous studies have noted that the length of cytoplasmic domain on VSV G, not the specific sequence, was required for efficient viral budding [19]. The real role of truncated G protein in attenuation of VSV has still not been identified, although it was reported that VSV C-terminal truncated G proteins acquired complex oligosaccharides \u223c6-fold slower than for wt G protein and displayed a reduced rate of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and presumably to the cell surface [18].",

Recombinant VSV with G\u039428 was shown to form significantly smaller plaques than virus with wild-type G, whereas plaque sizes between VSVXN2 and VSV\u0394M51 or those between VSV-G\u039428 and VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428 were similar, no matter whether M protein was mutated or not.

Therefore, VSV\u0394M51 was not suitable as a vaccine vector due to its potential pathogenesis in animals and safety is the most important criteria for developing a vaccine or vaccine vector. On the other hand, VSV\u0394M51 may be suitable for virotherapy, as many studies have attempted [27], [28], since, (1) efficacy is a priority as an antitumor drug and (2) many types of tumor cells are type I IFNs signaling defective [29].

The experimental conclusions included: (1) both G\u039428 and \u0394M51 contribute to the attenuation of VSV, however, G\u039428 is likely to play a more important role than \u0394M51. VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428 was determined to show the most significant attenuation in vitro. (2) Virulence of recombinant VSVs with truncated G protein (VSV-G\u039428, VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428) significantly decreased compared with wild-type VSV or VSV\u0394M51. (3) VSV-G\u039428 could stimulate a more potent protective immune response than VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428 possibly due to the extreme attenuation of VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428. Among different attenuated VSVs with mutated M and/or G proteins, recombinant VSV with only truncated G protein (VSV-G\u039428) displayed an ideal balance between pathogenesis and stimulation of a protective immune response that could be used as a promising vaccine vector.",
