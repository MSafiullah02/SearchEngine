Later, accepting the challenges to explore the efficiency of various control measures since the outbreak, fewer studies adopted more appropriate dynamical equations based on mathematical modeling techniques. Compartment models such as SI, SIR, SEIR which exhibits the change in the category of population among the susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered (R) classes have been developed and studied to understand the spread pattern of COVID-19 in many countries [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "Further, as reported, COVID-19 has a latent/incubation period (time from exposure to the development of symptoms), which is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days [12] . This incubation period is very significant as it allows the health authorities to introduce more adequate systems for separating people suspected of carrying the virus, as a way of controlling and preventing the spread of the pandemic [13] . The inclusion of the latent period in compartment models gives rise to COVID-19 time delay models in which the dynamic behavior of the disease at time t depends on the state of the system at a time prior to the delay period [14, 15] . However, these studies assume homogeneity in a large population and ignore numerical variations originating from natural births, deaths, and human migration networks across the regions. To the amount that population and geographic heterogeneities play crucial roles in the infection outbreak process, in order to pick up the vital characteristics of the pandemic, it is advantageous to include them in the time delay model. Capturing the critical impact of the delay period of COVID-19, this study presents a mathematical model to analyze the spread of the novel coronavirus within a heterogeneous population and geography. We propose a more realistic time delay differential equations based SEIQRD model by incorporating quarantined (Q)-confirmed and separated infected population as well as death due to infection class (D) along with the optimal values for model parameters, which reasonably fit the actual infection cases of the pandemic. Spatial and stochastic parameters like heterogeneous population, natural births, deaths, and population migration networks within a geographical state (subpopulation in a country) boundaries have been considered. Predominantly, in the presented model, considering the spatial heterogeneity, the entire population of the broad geographical region of interest is divided into small sub regions-states, which interact by means of migrations across the state boundaries. Moreover, there are many inevitable questions related to the spread of the pandemic. How many people are at risk of infection ? When will be the infection at its peak and when will it end ? Are the existing control measures sufficient to control the outbreak ? With the aim to explore more about the transmission of COVID-19 dynamics and to predict its potential tendency, the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated for forward time. The general points of interest including total infected cases, infection peak, pandemic ending time are investigated. The most vital parameter, basic reproduction number R 0 and its time-dependent generalization that decides if an originating infectious disease can extend in a population, has been estimated at both regional and its sub regional levels. Additionally, the influence of the time delay on the long term pandemic dynamics has been explored. Further, we use the model to examine the impact of the most significant lockdown measure that has been implemented to contain the pandemic spread.",

            "text": "To estimate the trajectories of COVID-19 transmission, in the proposed approach, a vast geographic region with heterogeneous population distribution (country) is partitioned into n smaller sub-regions (states). To take into account the effect of both inter and intrastate infectious population, migration for these states are explicitly incorporated ( Fig. 1(a) ), using population migration adjacency matrix \u03bb (with order n \u00d7 n). The diagonal coefficients of this matrix represent the migration rate within a state while for any of its j th row, k th element indicates the migration factor from the j th state to the k th state. For any two states which share no boundaries migration rate is 0. Within a given state, the transmission is handled according to a deterministic compartmental model dividing the population into six epidemiological classes S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t) describing at time t the respective proportion of the susceptible cases, exposed cases (infected but not capable of transmitting infection, in a latent period), infected cases (with the infection spreading capacity and not yet separated from those who are not infected), quarantined cases (confirmed and separated infected), recovered cases and deaths owing to virus cases. Fig. 1(b) shows the movement within the classes in model with time delay. Since the latent period (\u03c4 ) of the COVID-19 is as long as 2 to 14 days [1], the exposed class (E) originates because of interactions with the amount \u03b2 within susceptible (S) and infected class (I). Only those members of the exposed class who survive the latency period move to the infected class with a rate of \u03c3. The infected population tested positive for COVID-19 moves to quarantine class (Q) for further treatment with parameter . After a course of quarantine treatment, either a part of its population is discharged with the rate \u03b4 from the hospital (R) or encounter death due to underline diseases (D) with an estimate \u03b3. An appendix (A) provides complete details of our mathematical model characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations depicting the outbreak at time t. The primary model parameters, reasonably fitting the actual infected cases till date, are described in Table I in the appendix (C).",

It is significant to mention that, at present, due to lack of sufficient diagnostic test for COVID-19, the total number of infected cases (I + Q) in any j th state, can be given by (I(t)+Q(t))\u03b1N j . Here, N j denotes the population of the j th state, and \u03b1 is considered approximately as 0.1 in the role of the current testing events [18] . Clearly, the total infected cases in a country with n states can be obtained by the sum of corresponding data from the states. At the onset, we used the proposed model to fit actual available COVID-19 infection cases for India up to April 30, 2020 (Fig. 2) . Notably, since India went into a strict lockdown that commenced on March 25, 2020, officially published data by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India from March 16, 2020 to April 30, 2020 are marked in pink spots and are considered as a direct validation source.

This relaxation assumes gradual freedom of movement for essential activities only, thereby ensuring the upliftment of lockdown in stages to save the economy. Moreover, considering self awareness within the population, we invoked reduced average contact parameter \u03b2 between susceptible and infected to be approximately one, through social distancing impacts in this case. This alteration was required as a step to break or lessen human to human transmission chain of the virus. As likely, this consideration brings the total number of infections to comparatively lower values and slows the spread of the disease to manageable levels. Moreover, peak infections in the proposed scenario decrease significantly in comparison to a strict lockdown situation. This observation clearly highlights the fact that social distancing is one of several changes that we have to adapt strictly in the coming weeks. To ensure the distances are well maintained at work or public places, more mature ways of monitoring, including artificial intelligence or machine learning software, can be used. As depicted in Fig. 3(c) , as a suggestion, if social distancing is enforced broadly and is maintained in the coming months, the number of new infections would decrease to a significantly submissive level, and the outbreak could eventually be controlled. Additionally, in order to further evaluate the influence of the delay on the long term disease dynamics, we performed the sensitivity analysis on \u03c4 keeping other parameters fixed. We plotted the total infected cases and infectious cases as a function of time for systematically varied values of \u03c4 \u2208 [6, 12] shown by shaded regions in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 . Apparently, a small change in delay has no qualitative impact on the nature of the spread, apart from shifting of the curve, thereby preserving the basic shape of the infection pattern. Shifts in infection peak with varied \u03c4 provide us with a possible domain window range for estimation of infection cases owing to regional differences in India on account of health, education, religion, and per capita income.",

The estimated basic reproduction number for India in the present scenario of nationwide lockdown turns out to be 1.18. Based on this value of R 0 , as expected, from the transmission dynamics of the infection in a strick lockdown situation, shown in Fig. 4(a) , the number first increases before tending to zero, thereby R 0 = 1 acts as a clear edge between the disease widely spreading or dying out. It is worth mentioning here that in case of a relaxed lockdown with average contact rate between susceptible and infected as one, R 0 turns out to be 0.8739, which is much desired for outspread levels to reduce further to a manageable extent. This can be clearly verified from Fig. 4(c) , where the number of infectious decreases monotonically to zero. Additionally, Fig.  5 shows the time-dependent effective basic reproductive number R ef f 0 (t) corresponding to the infection trajectories in Fig. 4(a) . As hoped for, this value is greater than unity before peak infection and smaller than unity beyond its peak, serving as a useful estimate of the local rate of change of infectives at any time.

Furthermore, we applied our mathematical model to interpret the public data on the total number of infected cases from March, 16, 2020 onwards in two sub regions of India, including Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh, as discussed in the appendix (D). With lockdown in place, the peak infection witnessed a significant fall in comparison to the situation if there would have been no lockdown indicating the potential benefit of lockdown in controlling the outspread.

Our analysis includes two different regions (states), that is, Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh. It is significant to mention here that we have chosen Maharashtra since it has the highest number of infected cases as of April 30, 2020. Further, to analyze how accurately our model incorporates population heterogeneity, we have chosen Uttar Pradesh since it is the most populated state of India. In Fig.  6 (a) and Fig. 6(c) , the estimated number of total infec-ted cases is plotted for both the states by solid lines in case of nationwide strict lockdown scenario and actual COVID-19 infection data from March 16, 2020 to April 30, 2020 are marked by circles. Here also the reasonable agreement is observed between actual and forecasted data. We then run the proposed model for chosen parameters for the next 24 months and performed detailed analysis on similar lines for nationwide strict lockdown and no lockdown scenario, as discussed in Section III in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(d) . From the numerically obtained outcomes in forward time, with the implementation of lockdown, the peak infection witnessed a significant fall in comparison to the situation if there would have been no lockdown indicating the potential benefit of lockdown in controlling the outspread.
