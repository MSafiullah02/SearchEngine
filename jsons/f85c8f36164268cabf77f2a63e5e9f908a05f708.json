Biological evolution of species progressively produced today's forms of life, as we observe them. Millions of species co-exist today and share the stage (biosphere). Evolution soon registered colonies of unicellular beings, with the advantage of wider and specialized cellular functions but with the problem of preventing undesirable aggregations (casual or purposely parasitic and potentially dangerous situations anyway). Consequently, the need of surveillance by an efficient \"immune system\" is always present. The basic need of this surveillance system was (and always is) to preserve the genetic integrity of the individual being and the survival of the colony (multicellular entity): any novelty cannot be \"tolerated\" and regular cells (\"self\") must be quickly recognized as such, while stranger cells (\"not self\") must be eliminated (rejected) efficiently [2, 3] .",

The first \"immunological\" experiment by Jenner is something that would not be ethically feasible today by any medical deontological rules! He started from the observation that English milkmaids who caught cowpox (a benign form of skin eruptions from contacts with diseased cows) did not develop the human form of the smallpox disease; therefore, he voluntarily and deliberately exposed his gardener's son (James Phipps) to biological materials from cowpox pustules (causing a fever illness in the recipient); after recovery, Jenner challenged the boy with human smallpox, verifying his attained \"immunity\" also to the human disease [3] .",
