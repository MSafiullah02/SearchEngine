In early 2005, the disease broke out again, and the epidemic-stricken area spread to Liaoning Province, China. The mortalities of sea cucumber adults and juveniles were as high as 40% (Chang Y.Q., 20 March 2005, Key Lab Reports). A number of laboratories in China have undertaken the identification of the causative agent, and tried to prevent its spread or outbreak in 2006.",

About 2\u20133 days later, small white lesions usually appear in some of the diseased sea cucumbers and gradually expand, with increased mucus secretion over large areas of the body wall. About 5\u20136 days later, the diseased sea cucumber will die, and mortality may be more than 90% (Wang et al., 2005). According to the typical symptom and state, the disease was designated acute peristome edema disease (APED), by the study groups.",

Therefore the frozen section technology was used for the fast detection of these viral infections in our epidemiology and diagnostic study. As to the apply of TEM to discover agents, with SARS, as with previous investigations of outbreaks involving such viruses as Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and more recently, monkey pox, TEM played an essential role (Goldsmith et al., 2004). The epidemic viral diseases of aquatic organisms, especially those whose cells cannot be cultured yet, can be studied uniquely with this powerful tool.",

Only minimal intestine tissue can be obtained as material when the disease occurs, because of the sea cucumbers\u2019 peculiar evisceration. Therefore it is difficult to purify viruses from infected tissues. We have tried to purify the viral particles by sucrose gradient centrifugation of homogenates from intestine tissues.

From the severe traumas among virus-infected cells, it can be concluded that these sea cucumbers are not the natural hosts, but suffer as victims infected from other hosts. Even worse is that these viruses were also observed in the diseased larvae of sea cucumbers (1 mm), which were just 30 days old. In June of 2006, epidemic disease broke out during the seed cultivation in North China and caused 80% mortality. Similar viruses were observed replicated at high numbers in cytopathic cells, and causing severe pathological changes. That observation suggests that the viruses may now be transmitted vertically from the parents, even though the first infection and origin have not been confirmed yet. Now it seems less important for us to find the origin of these viruses, but to select uninfected parent sea cucumbers for brood stock cultivation.",
