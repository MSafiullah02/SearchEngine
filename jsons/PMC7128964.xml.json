For SARS-CoV there are no reports concerning the existence of replicative negative-stranded RNA in SARS patients. In order to evaluate (i) whether SARS-CoV can infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected persons, (ii) whether the virus can replicate in their PBMCs, and (iii) to reveal any dynamic changes to the virus during the course of the disease, we carried out follow-up investigations on the plus- and minus-RNA forms in SARS patients.",

On 12 April 2003, they traveled from Hangzhou to Wuhan City to meet other members of the family. Among them, the eldest sister, who was from Beijing, had a fever and a cough that had started on 11 April but the family members did not suspect their eldest sister being infected by SARS-CoV, and took no protective measures. After the family gathering, the eldest sister returned to Beijing, where she was soon admitted to hospital and diagnosed as a definite SARS case on 15 April. The three family members reported here came back to Hangzhou City on 14 April. The 53-year-old sister (Patient 3) began to show SARS-associated symptoms (fever, cough, pain in chest, etc.) on 17 April, as did the other two on 18 April. On 19 April all three patients were admitted to the special ward of a hospital designed for the isolation of infectious diseases. The strict containment conditions these three patients, infected in Wuhan City, were subjected to helped to interrupt the further spreading of their infection.",

It may partially help to explain why mild leukopenia or lymphopenia has been observed in SARS patients (Poutanen et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003). The detectable period of SARS-CoV replication in PBMCs of our three patients was less than 1 week, which suggests that viral replication in the cells is probably self-limited.",

The presence of the minus-RNA reflecting \u2018replicative intermediates\u2019 of this CoV in PBMCs is limited to within a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, suggesting that replication in the PBMCs is subject to self-limitation. Our results raise questions requiring further studies, PBMCs being in fact mixtures of various types of cells. Finding out which type(s) of PBMCs are the main target for invasion and replication by SARS-CoV will be important in the search for molecules or receptors which can bind to the virus at the surface of these cells. This will facilitate the design and development of drugs to block the binding of SARS-CoV to susceptible cells. Also, our results should be valuable in helping to determine the administration of anti-virus and immunomodulator for SARS in clinical practice.",
