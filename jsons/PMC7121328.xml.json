Rickets was first described in England by Whistler (1645) and Glisson (1650). In the next century, Sniadecki established a connection between skeleton malformation and lack of sunlight among children in Warsaw (Mozolowski 1939). The disease became known as the English disease in many countries. Mellanby (1918) demonstrated that rickets (Fig. 23.1) could be prevented in dogs by supplementing their diet with cod liver oil, and Hess and Unger (1921) showed that rickets could be cured by sunlight. Hess and Weinstock (1924) and Steenbock and Black (1924) showed that the exposure of lettuce and several other foodstuffs to radiation from a mercury vapour lamp would render them antirachitic.\n\n",

The reason that there is no vitamin D1 is that the product first given this name turned out not to be a single compound but a mixture. In some non-mammal vertebrates, other compounds act in a similar way as vitamins D2 and D3 (Holick 1989), but they have not been chemically defined. In most organisms, the synthesis of vitamin D requires UV-B radiation. Exceptions to this rule will be described later. Vitamin D is formed from the provitamins (provitamin D2, also called ergosterol, and provitamin D3, also called 7-dehydrocholesterol). UV-B radiation can photoisomerise the provitamins to the corresponding previtamins, either in vivo without the mediation of any enzyme or in solution. The previtamins are slowly converted by a nonenzymatic and non-photochemical reaction to the vitamins (Fig. 23.2).\n\n",

Since a vitamin is defined as a substance necessary for health which cannot be synthesised by the body and must be ingested with the food, vitamin D is, strictly speaking, not a vitamin. Since, however, exposure to sunlight can be insufficient for maintaining health and deficiency can be prevented by vitamin D in food, the vitamin status is defendable.",

This is insufficient for prevention of deficiency if exposure to UV-B radiation does not supplement the intake. It was found, e.g. that Moslems in Denmark were still deficient after taking 15 \u03bcg/day (Glerup et al. 2000). Attempts to avoid the need for UV exposure by high daily intake (over 50 \u03bcg daily) cannot be recommended, as this can lead to vitamin D intoxication. Exposure even to high daily fluence of UV-B radiation can never lead to vitamin D overdosage, as will be explained below.",

But this is far from the only UV-driven reaction in the vitamin D context. The basic photochemistry of the vitamin D system was summarised by Havinga (1973). Previtamin D is also sensitive to UV radiation and can undergo three different photoreversible photochemical reactions. It can be either reconverted to provitamin D or converted to lumisterol or tachysterol and further irreversibly to products known under the common name of toxisterols (Boomsma et al. 1975). Vitamin D is sensitive to UV radiation and can be photoconverted to three compounds: 5,6-trans-vitamin D3, suprasterol 1, and suprasterol 2 (Webb et al. 1989).\n\n",

This quantum yield increases slowly with wavelength from 295 to 302 nm but then doubles from 0.08 at 302 nm to 0.16 at 305 nm and then increases steadily to 0.29 at 325 nm. The quantum yield of cis-trans isomerisation to tachysterol decreases correspondingly over the same wavelength range.

It was found that the thermochemical step forming vitamin D, following the photochemical conversion of provitamin D, takes place more quickly in cells than in solutions (Tian et al. 1993; Holick et al. 1995). The reason for this is the existence of the conformer of previtamin D (lower right, Fig. 23.3 Dmitrenko et al. 2001). In solution, this is the preferred conformer, and it cannot be converted directly to vitamin D. In membranes, both natural and artificial liposome membranes (Tian and Holick 1999), the previtamin is held in the active, vitamin-producing conformer (cf. Saltiel et al. 2003). The same effect can be achieved by complexing the previtamin with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (Tian and Holick 1995).",

It has a single peak at about 297 nm that roughly corresponds to the long-wavelength absorption band of provitamin D3 dissolved in n-hexane (Fig. 23.4). A digitised version with a long-wavelength extrapolation to 329.5 nm, having a maximum value at 297.5 nm (Bouillon et al. 2006), has been adopted by CIE (Comit\u00e9 International de l\u2019\u00c9clairage) as an official reference spectrum. This spectrum should be regarded as tentative, and there is reason to use it with caution (Norval et al. 2010). The absorption spectrum for provitamin D3 is three-peaked, but the two short-wave absorption bands are lacking in the action spectrum. Two circumstances could contribute to this lack: (1) the stratum corneum of the skin could filter the shorter wavelength components, and (2) since at the shorter wavelengths both provitamin and previtamin absorb but at the longer wavelengths (around 295 nm) only provitamin and tachysterol, the conversion of provitamin to previtamin is favoured at long wavelengths, while at shorter wavelengths the back and side reactions of previtamin are important competitors. Probably, under the conditions in which the action spectrum was determined, the first reason is more important.\n\n",

Remarkably, this action spectrum is displaced about 5 nm towards longer wavelength (peaking at about 302 nm) compared to the spectrum determined by MacLaughlin et al. (1982). Although no wavelength below 285 nm was tested, the spectrum indicates a rise from 293 nm towards shorter wavelengths. The minimum at approximately 293 nm is deeper than would be expected from the provitamin D3 absorption spectrum. Takada et al. (1979) investigated the spectral dependence of vitamin D3 formation in shaved cat skin. They found a maximum at 303 nm, similar to Lehmann et al. (2001). Their long-wavelength tail extends all the way to 340 nm. However, their spectrum must be regarded as very approximate, since it is plotted as effect at constant fluence, and the spectral bandwidth of the radiation is not stated. As the spectra of MacLaughlin et al. (1982) and Lehmann et al. (2001), it is plotted on an energy rather than photon basis and, therefore, not expected to match an absorption spectrum exactly. Knudson and Benford (1938) compared the effectiveness of different UV wavebands in preventing rickets in shaved rats. They found a peak at approximately the same wavelength as MacLaughlin et al. (1982) but also a (higher) peak at about 280 nm.",

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is then formed by a thermochemical reaction. Vitamin D3 attaches to the vitamin D-binding protein (Gc-globulin) and enters the blood stream. In the liver it undergoes hydroxylation by the 25-hydroxylase enzyme, CYP27A1, to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] (calcidiol). A second hydroxylation step takes place in the kidney by the enzyme 1\u03b1-hydroxylase enzyme, CYP27B1, to form 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) which is the active form of vitamin D. 1,25(OH)2D3 can interact with the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) present in many cell types in the body, thus affecting the transcription of more than 2,000 genes. 1,25(OH)2D3 also induces rapid response signalling through a specific membrane receptor, recently identified as a protein disulfide isomerase, Pdia3 (Doroudi et al. 2014). The amount of circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 is tightly regulated by negative feedback control through induction by the hormone of 24-hydroxylase which catabolises both 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 into various calcitonic acid products. There is limited evidence that 1,25(OH)2D3 can be formed entirely in the epidermis following exposure to UV-B radiation.\n\n",

This is highest in the summer months and decreases to 5 % of this value at mid-latitudes in the winter and is zero at higher latitudes. One recent study illustrates clearly how the solar UV-B irradiation affects the vitamin D status of a population. In the USA, the peak in vitamin D levels was found in August and the trough in February, a lag of 8 weeks after the peak and trough respectively in ambient UV-B (Kasahara et al. 2013). The solar zenith angle also explains why at least 50 % of the daily UV radiation is found in the 4 h period around local noon. Other environmental variables are ozone, cloud cover, air pollution, altitude, and surface reflection, such as from snow or choppy water. There are also large differences between individuals in their ability to produce active vitamin D following a given dose of solar UV-B. These include skin type, age, amount of clothing worn and head cover, use of sunscreen, body mass index, serum cholesterol level, polymorphisms in VDR and enzymes of the vitamin D pathway, and baseline 25(OH)D. For example, to synthesise the same amount of previtamin D3, about a sixfold higher dose of UV-B is required for black skin compared with fair skin (due to absorption by melanin) (Clemens et al. 1982), and a twofold higher dose is required for an 80-year-old compared with a 20-year-old (due to the reduction in 7-dehydrocholesterol in older skin) (MacLaughlin and Holick 1985).",

Liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) can distinguish between 25(OH)D2 (produced after consuming plants and vitamin D2 supplements) and 25(OH)D3 and is rapidly becoming the method of choice.

For example, 31 % of a large representative adult population in Australia, 21.4 % of women of child-bearing age in Oman, and 57 % of women and 49 % of men, aged 65 and above, in England all had 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L. Efforts have been made to construct models using the action spectrum from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 in the human skin to predict how much sun exposure an individual requires under different climate conditions to ensure a satisfactory vitamin D status (McKenzie et al. 2009, 2011; Diffey 2010).

The disease that results from the deficiency in children is called rickets in which bone deformities are found due to chondrocyte disaggregation and skeletal mineralisation defects. It is estimated that 25(OH)D levels lower than about 20 nmol/L can lead to rickets. Supplementation with vitamin D is recommended for infants aged 0\u201312 months. In adults, osteomalacia can result from vitamin D deficiency, with defective mineralisation of the collagen matrix and hence reduced structural support and increased risk of fracture. Osteoporosis can also occur in the elderly with an increased risk of fracture. Osteoblast activity is reduced and bone mineralisation is defective. Although various studies have not produced consistent results, they suggest that 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/L are required for protection against osteomalacia and osteoporosis (reviewed in Wacker and Holick 2013).",

Vitamin D also acts indirectly on calcium and phosphorus levels via the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Low levels of 25(OH)D are associated with low levels of serum-ionised calcium, a situation which leads to increased PTH levels. Higher 25(OH)D levels with associated higher calcium levels have the reverse effects on PTH. Both PTH and 1,25(OH)2D stimulate osteoblasts to mobilise calcium stores.

One important effect is to promote the expression of the cathelicidin gene in macrophages which leads to the production of cathelicidin (Liu et al. 2007). This peptide has antimicrobial activity against intracellular bacteria. 1,25(OH)2D induces autophagy in monocytes and macrophages via the induction of cathelicidin which then activates transcription of the autophagy-related genes (Yuk et al. 2009). Autophagy is the process whereby a cell self-digests through the action of enzymes within the same cell, thus preventing the survival of intracellular bacteria and viruses. Low levels of vitamin D result in impaired development of invariant natural killer T cells, a consequence that is particularly apparent if the deficiency occurs in utero (Cantorna et al. 2012). The invariant natural killer T cells are involved in many immunological processes; they recognise lipids and glycolipids rather than the peptide-MHC complexes recognised by other T cell subsets, and, on activation, produce a range of immunostimulatory mediators including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1.",

Several disease categories in which vitamin D may play an important role by modulating the immune response have been described. These cover a wide range of common conditions. The evidence frequently relies on the group of patients with the disease having a lower 25(OH)D level than the group of controls. However, few of these studies are prospective and therefore cannot distinguish whether the low status is a consequence of the disease or is a significant risk factor. Clinical trials using vitamin D supplements to prevent the disease or, more commonly, as a treatment have yielded inconsistent results thus far. In addition, it is difficult and frequently impossible to separate the effects of solar UV radiation from the effects of vitamin D in human subjects (Hart and Gorman 2013). Therefore this area is one of uncertainty at present in which there is vigorous research interest and activity.",

As outlined in Sect. 23.6.1, many aspects of innate immunity which are important in protection against viral infection of the respiratory tract are diminished by insufficient vitamin D. In particular, the reduced production of antimicrobial peptides by neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells of the respiratory tract and by epithelial cells may be important as well as the lack of autophagy in macrophages. In addition, the action of vitamin D in suppressing the cytokine \u201cstorm\u201d that is a feature of many respiratory infections may be vital (de Jong et al. 2006).",

However, it should be noted that in almost all of these studies, the population already had symptoms of the infection at the time of the 25(OH)D assessment. Thus whether a low vitamin D status contributes to the risk of a symptomatic infection or is a consequence of the infection cannot be distinguished. About eight prospective randomised double-blind trials have taken place which examined whether vitamin D3 supplements can prevent respiratory infections. No consistent difference in the risk of respiratory infection between those taking the supplement and those given a placebo was found (reviewed in Bergman et al. 2013).

In the nineteenth century, cod liver oil, which contains the highest level of vitamin D3 of any food, was used in Europe to prevent childhood diseases such as tuberculosis. It was superseded by heliotherapy (sun exposure) and phototherapy (exposure to artificial light sources) before the development of antibiotics in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus a possible link between vitamin D deficiency and susceptibility to tuberculosis or disease progression has a long history. More recent studies consistently report that subjects with tuberculosis have insufficient 25(OH)D levels or lower levels than control subjects (reviewed in Ralph et al. 2013). It is clearly difficult to investigate whether vitamin D status influences susceptibility to infection with M. tuberculosis and development of active disease from latency or response to treatment. In particular, whether a low 25(OH)D level is a consequence of the disease or a risk factor for, it needs to be distinguished. This can only be examined in prospective studies. Clinical trials using vitamin D supplements to prevent progression from latent to active tuberculosis have not been undertaken as yet, but other trials in which the supplements were administered to treat active disease have yielded predominantly negative results. The reasons that these trials do not support the observational findings include the possibilities that suboptimal doses of the supplement were used or that they did not lead to a sufficient increase in 1,25(OH)2D or that host determinants were not taken into account such as expression of the hydroxylases and the vitamin D-binding protein and polymorphisms in the VDR (Ralph et al. 2013).",

Although the aetiology of these diseases is multifactorial with a clear genetic susceptibility, there is evidence that one environmental risk factor might be low exposure to solar UV radiation leading to insufficient vitamin D. As outlined in Sect. 23.6.1 above, 1,25(OH)2D has effects on the immune system that could help to prevent autoimmunity.

In MS, there is immune-mediated destruction of myelin-producing cells and axonal loss in the central nervous system, and it is the most frequent disabling neurological disorder of young adults. The latitudinal gradient for MS was first noted more than 50 years ago (Acheson and Bachrach 1960) and has been validated in more recent reports, including a comprehensive meta-analysis of global data in 2011 (Simpson et al. 2011). A similar latitudinal variation in the incidence of the common precursor of MS, called first central nervous system demyelinating events, has also been found (Taylor et al. 2010). Low ambient UV radiation or low sun exposure in childhood may be particularly significant in increasing the risk of MS in later life. Also, the month of birth has an important effect on the risk of MS development in the offspring; an increased risk for those born in the spring when maternal 25(OH)D levels are likely to be low and a decreased risk for those born in the late autumn/early winter when maternal 25(OH)D levels are likely to be higher (Dobson et al. 2013). In two large cohort studies in the USA, a higher vitamin D intake in the form of supplements and higher serum 25(OH)D levels were both linked to a decreased risk of MS (Munger et al. 2004; Munger et al. 2006). There was a particularly strong inverse relationship if the higher 25(OH)D level occurred before the age of 20 years. Furthermore the relapse rates for MS correlate inversely with serum 25(OH)D levels.",

Such studies are difficult and costly to undertake due to the low incidence of MS, the length of follow-up that is required, the need for a placebo group and for monitoring radiological, clinical, and immunological parameters, and uncertainties regarding the optimal dose of the supplement and how frequently it should be taken. However, there remains the intriguing possibility of using vitamin D supplements as an inexpensive, safe, and easy to administer treatment to improve current therapies in MS.",

The evolutionary lines leading to molluscs and to vertebrates are estimated, with some uncertainty, to have diverged about 720 million years ago.

This is now changing. Recently, there has been much interest in comparing the effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 in human nutrition (Horst et al. 2000). When administered over a prolonged time, both are equally well taken up and converted to 25(OH)D circulating in the blood stream and also hydroxylated a second time to 1,25(OH)2D. Tsugawa et al. (1999) found that the D2 form of 1,25(OH)2D binds equally well as the D3 form to the VDR. However, this experiment used calf VDR, and the results may not apply to the polymorphic forms of the human receptor. The D2 forms are not converted to the corresponding D3 forms (Holick et al. 2008; Biancuzzo et al. 2013). Some of the vitamin D, D2, as well as D3 is also converted to 1,24,25-hydroxylated forms. While 1,24,25(OH)3D3 can bind to the VDR and exert biological activity, 1,24,25(OH)3D2 is inactive (see Houghton and Vieth 2006 for this and related topics), and this results in vitamin D2 having less overall activity than vitamin D3. It should be noted that differences in effects between D2 and D3 forms are not as large in humans as in rats and birds.",

This provitamin has also been found in the diatom Skeletonema menzelii, the coccolithophorid Emaliana huxleyi (Holick 1989), and the chrysophycean Ochromonas danica (Gershengorn et al. 1968). In addition, there have been numerous investigations on phytoplankton of mixed composition. In one instance, a correlation with the probable UV exposure was established, using season as a proxy for irradiation (Takeuchi et al. 1991; see also Tables 1a and 1b in Bj\u00f6rn and Wang 2001). Among macroalgae, not only ergosterol but also provitamin D2 and vitamins D2 and D3 have been found in the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus grown under natural conditions with a higher content of the vitamins at a lower (southern Sweden) than at a higher (northern Norway) latitude. Provitamin D3 is present in the gametophyte of the red alga Chondrus crispus, while the sporophyte of the same species contains the isomer 22-dehydrocholesterol.",

This is an inherited (\u201cracial\u201d) trait that has evolved independently in Europe and Asia (Norton et al. 2007), but many individuals can acclimatise phenotypically to some extent (i.e. the skin forms pigment in response to UV radiation; see 10.1007/978-1-4939-1468-5_24 and Cui et al. 2007). UV radiation can cause skin cancer and other problems, and these effects are particularly frequent for people poorly adapted for the high environmental radiation they are exposed to, such as people of European origin living in South Africa and Australia. Thus, clearly, the pigment works as protection against high radiation. It has been proposed (Branda and Eaton 1978; Jablonski and Chaplin 2000) that pigmentation is important for photoprotection of folic acid, but in vivo, this substance is photoprotected in another way (Vorobey et al. 2006). Although vitamin D is toxic at too high a concentration, it has been shown by Holick et al. (1981) that skin pigment is not necessary to prevent its overaccumulation; the photochemical system is self-regulating. The reason for this is the low rate of conversion of previtamin to vitamin, in combination with the photochemical side and back reactions of previtamin D. Thus, toxicity can occur only following excessive intake (e.g. Koutkia et al. 2001).",

All humans are thought to originate from Africa and presumably are all descendants of black-skinned people, although at a prehuman furred stage, lighter skin is possible as found in chimpanzees (Jablonski and Chaplin 2000). But with migration to higher and higher latitudes, the skin colour became paler (Fig. 23.6). The selection pressure for this is clear: avoidance of vitamin D deficiency (Clemens et al. 1982). African people who have emigrated north in historic time are known to suffer from just such a deficiency (Shewakramani et al. 2001). Inuits may have more pigment than would be predicted from their northern habitat; their traditional food is from the sea and mostly rich in vitamin D (because the sea currents bring vitamin D from lower and more sunny latitudes), so they have not been exposed to the same selection pressure as people with more terrestrial habits.\n\n",

This converts to vitamin D on exposure to sunlight and is ingested at the next preening. Later investigations with more modern methods of analysis have failed to establish with certainty that provitamin D is in the uropygial secretion. There is a single study, using the best analytical methods available at the time, which demonstrated the presence of provitamin D3 in the uropygial gland of domestic fowl (Gallus) (Uva et al. 1978). Such an investigation needs to be repeated using high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and absorption spectroscopy, since the identification of provitamin D3 among all the steroids present in uropygial secretion is not straightforward. If its presence can be established, the analysis could be extended to other kinds of birds. It should also be mentioned that Holick (1989; referring to unpublished observations by himself and M.A. St. Lezin) found no provitamin D3 in chicken feathers. On the other hand, it is well established that fowl can use UV absorbed by the head and legs to improve their vitamin D and calcium status and egg production. It is assumed that birds like arctic owls and ptarmigans are totally dependent on vitamin D in the food for covering their requirements. Birds cannot efficiently use vitamin D2 only D3.",

They are covered with hair and do not have a uropygial gland, so they rely heavily on food for their vitamin D. The critical time is the dark winter, and the most important winter food is reindeer lichen. We (Wang et al. 2001) investigated one species of reindeer lichen from different latitudes (Fig. 23.7) and found that it contained both vitamins D2 and D3, in a strongly latitude-dependent manner, with the lowest values in northern Scandinavia even by the end of the summer. Still, 10 g of the lichen from northern Scandinavia would provide a human with the necessary daily amount, but would humans eat lichen? Wild reindeer survive, even on Spitsbergen island at 78\u00b0N, where the vitamin D content in their food must be lower than this. Could there be another source? It would perhaps be worth looking at what the rumen bacteria can produce.\n\n",

(1998, 2001) have shown that cells of Solanum glaucophyllum grown in culture in darkness form 1,25(OH)2D3, albeit at lower concentrations than the plant under sun-exposed field conditions. The mechanism is not known, but one has been proposed by Norman and Norman (1993) to explain how animals like subterranean mole rats, living in darkness, can obtain their requirement from underground plant parts. It is, however, (1) doubtful whether these animals need vitamin D (Pitcher and Buffenstein 1995 and literature cited there) and (2) unlikely that their diet is really completely vitamin D-free, as we have found small amounts of vitamins D2 and D3 in carrot roots not exposed to UV radiation (Wang and Bj\u00f6rn, unpublished). The same holds for nocturnal animals (Opperman and Ross 1990; Kwiecinski et al. 2001). Larsson (1999) has erroneously claimed that Opperman and Ross (1990) found that the nocturnal fruit-eating bat Rousettus aegyptiacus can form 7-dehydrocholesterol from mevalonate.",

In the regression equation at the bottom of the graph, y stands for reflectance in percent and x for latitude in degrees. There is a clear trend of darker skin colour towards the equator. The great variation around the regression curve has several causes. Even \u201cindigenous populations\u201d have migrated and settled in their present regions within a time span which is often too short to allow complete adaptation to the environment. The way of life also modulates the need for sunlight. Thus, the square at the highest latitude (a little above 60\u00b0) lies far below the regression curve.
