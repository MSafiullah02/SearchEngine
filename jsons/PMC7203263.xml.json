            "text": "Diarrhea represents the third leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in the world, with serious impacts on public health policies and economies, particularly of lower-income countries [1]. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) remains an important etiological agent of diarrheal illness in childhood and is the most common cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea [1\u20134]. The disease developed by ETEC strains requires the production of colonization factors (CFs), responsible for bacterial adhesion to enterocytes, as well as heat-stable toxins (ST) and/or heat-labile toxins (LT) [5, 6]. LT alone, or in combination with ST, is expressed by more than half of the ETEC isolates [7, 8]. Once produced and released into the small intestine, LT binds to host cells via the pentameric B subunit, which leads to increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels due to indirect enzymatic activity of the A subunit, causing water/electrolyte losses and, thereby, watery diarrhea of different severities [5, 6].",

Our group previously showed the occurrence of 16 LT types among ETEC strains derived from asymptomatic and diarrheic Brazilian children [11]. These LT types were grouped into four phylogenetic clusters, two of which (A and D) comprised the majority of the variants closely related to the types LT1 and LT2, respectively. More recently, these results were confirmed by further studies, and twelve additional LT variants were found among clinical strains isolated from diverse geographic areas [12]. Genetic polymorphisms in noncoding regulatory sequences and in LT-structural genes have also been ascribed to different LT types [11, 12, 14]. However, considering the data available in the literature, thus far it has not been possible to correlate the ability to express LT and the natural genetic polymorphisms detected among different LT types.",

LT production is repressed by heat-stable nucleoid-structural (H-NS) proteins, which bind a region of DNA near the transcriptional start site and a site at the end of the eltA gene [22]. Under environmental changes, particularly at 37 \u00b0C, the DNA-H-NS complex is destabilized, allowing the binding of RNA polymerase, leading to the synthesis of eltAB polycistronic mRNA [22, 23]. In addition, it was reported that the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) negatively regulates LT expression, but there are doubts about the direct binding of this protein to the eltAB regulatory region [24, 25]. Posttranslational regulation of LT expression has also been reported, but the available evidence is weak [20, 21, 26].",

Alternatively, bacterial strains were cultivated for 6 h, processed without normalizing the culture optical density, and the LT concentrations were adjusted according to the total protein content, which was determined using the Bradford assay. The last protocol allowed us to normalize LT concentration both in the bacterial cell extracts and supernatants and generate LT values from cell extracts similar to those obtained with cellular density adjustments equivalent to 5 (Fig. S1, Supplementary Material). For routine analyses of LT expression in the tested ETEC strains, we applied the protocol based on the normalization of LT expression by total protein content. The total LT production for each bacterial strain was calculated according to the following formula: secreted LT + cell-associated LT (ng/ml)/total protein in the supernatant + cell-associated total protein (mg/ml), and the resulting values were expressed by ng of LT/mg of total protein.",

We sequenced the region encompassing 334 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon of the eltA gene of 8 ETEC strains expressing 4 different serotypes and 5 different LT types (1, 2, 3, 5, and 14), according to a previously reported classification based on the eltAB gene sequences (Table 1) [11]. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (PMID 10592173), this 334 bp region may also contain the promoter elements of the 2 open reading frames (ORFs) divergently transcribed to the eltAB operon (Fig. 1A). The sequence of the ETEC reference strain H10407 was identical to that derived from plasmid p666 and previously deposited in GenBank (GenBank: FN649417.1). Altogether, seven polymorphic sites were found in the sequence upstream of the transcription start site: four were located at presumed nonregulatory DNA sequences (T-229C, A-195G, T-92C, A-78G), two at the promoter region (spacer and Pribnow box: G-14T and C-7T, respectively), and one at the UP regulatory element (deletion at position \u2212 51 from start site of transcription) (Fig. 1A). Two of these polymorphic sites were not previously reported (A-78G and a deletion at position \u2212 51), and the A-78G polymorphic site was characteristic of strains belonging to the O88 serogroup that express LT3/LT5 types. In addition, no polymorphic sites were found at the previously reported CRP-binding sites [24]. Based on the determined eltAB sequences, the tested strains were grouped into three clusters according to the serotypes and/or LT types (Fig. 1B and Table 1). As previously shown [14], our results confirmed the natural genetic polymorphism in the eltAB transcriptional regulatory elements among LT1- and LT2-producing ETEC strains and, for the first time, also among strains encoding LT3, LT5, and LT14 types.",

The recombinant E. coli strains harboring the transcriptional fusions showed similar growth patterns to the nontransformed E. coli (data not shown). The presence of PeltAB(H10407) resulted in a two- to fourfold increase in GFP production compared to the expression observed with PeltAB(G-14 T, C-7 T) and PeltAB(C-7 T), respectively (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the tested nucleotide changes affected the transcriptional activity of the eltAB genes. To confirm these findings, we monitored the production of LT-specific mRNA in different ETEC strains. In our experimental conditions, with the primers designed for rpoA, a housekeeping gene, and for eltB, as the target gene (FwRTeltB and RvRTeltB), we observed clear correlations among Ct values and the amounts of cDNA (Table 2, Fig. 2A and B). Based on this set of primers, the levels of eltB-specific transcripts in the H10407 strain were approximately 4- and 12-fold higher than those expressed by the tested O159- or O88-associated ETEC strains, which harbor PeltAB(G-14 T, C-7 T) and PeltAB(C-7 T), respectively (Figs. 1 and 2C). Similar to the results generated with the operon fusion experiments, it was possible to demonstrate that the observed sequence polymorphisms in the promoter sequence affected the elt operon transcriptional regulation in all tested ETEC strains. Additionally, ETEC strains sharing the same serotype/serogroup showed similar transcriptional regulation of the eltAB operon.",

For that purpose, we standardized the quantification using the total protein content present in both bacterial cell lysates and culture supernatants as a reference to measure the amount of cell-associated and secreted LT level (see Materials and Methods, Fig. S1, Supplementary Material). The total amount of LT produced by the tested ETEC strains ranged from 64 to 177 ng of toxin/mg of total protein, which included both cell-associated and secreted toxin (Fig. 3). Similar to the results based on the measurement of LT-specific mRNA levels, the H10407 strain expressed the highest LT concentrations among all tested ETEC strains (Figs. 2C and 3). Nonetheless, the amount of LT produced by H10407 [PeltAB(G-14, C-7)] did not correspond to the amount of transcript when compared with the O88:H25 strains [PeltAB(C-7 T)] and O159-H21/H17 strains [PeltAB(G-14 T, C-7 T)]. This observation indicates that the amount of LT produced by ETEC strains is also regulated by posttranscriptional factors. To demonstrate the differential stability behavior of LT produced by different treatments, we measured the amount of cell-associated LT in bacterial cultures treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor. As observed in Fig. 4, the stability of LT produced by H10407 was significantly lower than those observed with the other tested ETEC strains (Fig. 4A\u2013C). In addition, incubation of the cells in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture recovered the stability of LT produced by the H10407 strain (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these results demonstrated that LT production by ETEC strains is affected both by transcriptional and posttranscriptional elements.",

We identified polymorphic sites at the eltAB promoter region from different ETEC strains expressing the main LT phylogenetic groups. These mutations were previously shown by Joffr\u00e9 and Sj\u00f6ling (2016), but it was not possible to correlate them with distinct levels of eltAB gene-specific transcripts so far [14]. Here, we demonstrated differences in transcriptional activity according to the three clusters of mutations found in the promoters of the eltAB operon from the ETEC strains using GFP as a reporter gene. The data obtained with the promoter-gfp gene fusions were correlated with the distinct patterns of specific mRNA expression exhibited by the strains. The presence of cytosine in the Pribnow box proved to be critical to better the performance of the promoter activity of the eltAB operon since the transition of C-7 T diminished GFP and LT expression. Supporting these results, LT2 producers harboring the promoter PeltAB (C-7) [14] showed LT production profiles more similar to the H10407 reference strain [PeltAB(C-7)] than the LT2-associated ETEC strains evaluated in the present study [PeltAB(C-7 T)]. In all allelic variants, the \u2212 10 region of the eltAB operon remains a highly AT-rich promoter, which may not interfere with promoter opening. However, cytosine instead of thymine at the \u2212 7 position may increase recognition by sigma factor 70 and consequently may improve gene transcription. A similar behavior was observed when promoters that regulate genes belonging to the adaptive response to DNA alkylating agents were mutated [32]. Together, these results demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms in the promoter impact the transcriptional activity of the eltAB operon and contribute to the diversity of LT expression in ETEC.",

One polymorphism was found in the RBS of the eltB gene from H10407 and could contribute to compensation at the translation level of the strong transcriptional activity of the eltAB operon in comparison with other tested strains. However, additional experiments are required to confirm this observation. On the other hand, we consistently detected instability of H10407-derived LT (LT1) under culture growth conditions, which at least partially explains why H10407 [PeltAB(G-14, C-7)] expressed four to ten times more eltAB transcripts but produced only approximately two times more LT than ETEC strains from serogroups O88 and O159 [PeltAB(C-7 T) and PeltAB(G-14 T, C-7 T), respectively]. The stability of this protein was recovered under treatment with protease inhibitors, indicating strong control of LT production by the cellular protein degradation machinery in H10407. This susceptibility to proteolysis does not seem to be due to LT type and may be ascribed to specificities of the proteolytic machinery of H10407. The proteolytic routes have been reported in the literature particularly the control of expression and activity of virulence and physiology regulators in bacteria [37, 38]. However, proteolysis of LT as regulatory mechanism of expression has not been described previously. Collectively, the results showed in the present study demonstrate that LT production is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms of protein regulation, allowing the control of overexpression of LT by some ETEC strains.",

            "text": "Despite the natural diversity of ETEC, clonal relationships among some strains have been demonstrated by phenotypic and genotypic methods [6, 7, 10, 13]. As such, ETEC strains sharing determined serotypes or serogroups have shown the same pattern of virulence factors; for example, the O6:H16 strains are CFA-II+LT+ST+ [7]. Here, we observed that strains sharing the same serogroup (O88 or O159) and expressing phylogenetically clustered LTs (LT3/LT5 or LT2/LT14, respectively) show similar patterns of LT production and the same allelic variant in the etxAB promoter [PeltAB(C-7 T) or PeltAB(G-14 T, C-7 T), respectively] in comparison with reference ETEC H10407 [PeltAB(G-14, C-7)]. In fact, such lineages sharing the same serogroup present a close genetic relationship defined by the MLEE, PFGE, and RAPD profiles [10]. Additionally, our results together with those reported by Joffr\u00e9 and Sj\u00f6ling (2016) [14] reveal that LT2-producing strains with different genetic backgrounds show distinct LT production profiles. In fact, previous reports at the global or local geographic scale have demonstrated the diversity of LT expression among ETEC strains, even among strains expressing the same LT type [11, 12, 15].",
