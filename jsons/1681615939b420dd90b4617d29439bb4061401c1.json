            "text": "Swine influenza viruses belong to the group of influenza A viruses (IAVs), which contain eight segmented negativesense RNA as a genome [1] . The IAV genome contains the polymerase basic gene 2 (PB2), polymerase basic gene 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic gene (PA), hemagglutinin gene (HA), nucleoprotein gene (NP), neuraminidase gene (NA), matrix gene (M), and non-structural gene (NS) [1] . IAV infects a variety of hosts, including humans, poultry, pigs, dogs, and horses [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Aquatic birds are the main reservoirs for influenza A viruses, and 16 distinct HA and 9 NA subtypes of influenza viruses are known to circulate in them [10] . IAV is responsible for human pandemics, which occur at intervals of 10-40 years [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . There are four HA lineages of influenza viruses circulating in pigs: the classical 1A lineage (1A, swine classical lineage), which is derived from the ancestors of the 1918 human influenza pandemic, the 2009 pandemic lineage (1A, cH1-derived), which is derived from 2009 human pandemic influenza viruses, the human seasonal-like 1B lineage (1B lineage), which is derived from human seasonal H1 viruses, and the Eurasian avian-like 1C lineage (1C, EA Eurasian lineage), which is derived from avian H1 viruses [16, 20] .",

These classical swine influenza viruses dominantly circulated in pig populations until the late 1990s, when reassorted H3N2 swine influenza viruses containing genes from swine, human, and avian influenza viruses emerged [18, 19] . This novel swine H3N2 influenza virus contains NP, M, and NS from classical swine H1N1 influenza viruses; PB2 and PA 1 3 from North American avian influenza viruses; and HA, NA, and PB1 from human seasonal influenza viruses [18, 19] . The introduction of reassorted H3N2 influenza viruses accelerated the development of genetic diversity among influenza viruses in pigs. The internal genes of these H3N2 influenza viruses served as a backbone for the creation of novel H1N1 and H1N2 influenza viruses in pigs [20] . The introduction of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses (A (H1N1)pdm09) in pigs further diversified the gene constellations of swine influenza viruses [21] [22] [23] [24] . The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses have been shown to be reassorted viruses containing PB2 and PA genes from avian influenza viruses related to the North American lineage, a PB1 gene from H3N2 seasonal human influenza viruses, HA and NA genes from classical swine influenza viruses related to the North American lineage, and NA and M genes from avian influenza viruses [15, 25, 26] . In South Korea, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses have been isolated from pigs [5, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . A novel reassortant H1N2 virus containing internal genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses was found in Korean pigs in 2010 [27] , and H3N2 influenza viruses with three internal genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses were found in Korean pigs in 2015 [5] .",

Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid (\u03b1 2,3-SA), while human influenza viruses preferentially bind alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid (\u03b1 2,6-SA), and swine influenza viruses preferentially bind \u03b1 2,3-SA or both \u03b1 2,3-SA and \u03b1 2,6-SA [32] [33] [34] . Pigs are regarded as a mixing vessel capable of generating novel IAVs, since cells of the porcine respiratory tract contain both \u03b1 2,3-SA and \u03b1 2,6-SA, rendering them susceptible to infection by both human and avian influenza viruses [35, 36] .",

Pigs infected with avian-origin-HA-containing H1N2 (A/swine/Korea/s803/2018) had higher body temperatures and more growth retardation than pigs infected with classical-swine-origin HA-containing H1N2 (A/swine/Korea/ s806/2018) ( Supplementary Fig. 2 a and b) . The mean peak body temperature for pigs infected with A/swine/Korea/ s803/2018 (H1N2) was 41.0 \u00b0C at day 5 p.i., while that for pigs infected with A/swine/Korea/s806/2018 (H1N2) was 39.6 \u00b0C at 5 day p.i.

In PBS-mock-infected control pigs, the average weight at 14 days p.i. was 155.6% of the original weight ( Supplementary Fig. 2b) .

Viral titres in nasal swabs and lung tissues of pigs infected with A/swine/Korea/ s803/2018 (H1N2) or A/swine/Korea/s806/2018 (H1N2) were measured ( Fig. 1a and b) .

Pigs act as a mixing vessel to create novel influenza viruses, since they are easily infected with human and avian influenza viruses. We isolated five of H1N2 influenza viruses from Korean pigs in 2018. These isolates are divided into two groups: avian-origin-H1-and classical swine-origin-H1-containing viruses. Avian-origin-H1-containing H1N2 viruses cause more-severe disease in mice and pigs than classical swineorigin-H1-containing H1N2 influenza viruses. The H1N2 influenza viruses isolated from Korean pigs in 2018 were divided into two groups, avian-origin H1 (A/ swine/Korea/s803/2018 (H1N2) and classical swine-origin A/swine/Korea/s806/2018 (H1N2), based on similar constellations of the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, NA, N, and NS genes. We found that the PA and NP genes were derived from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Previously isolated swine H1N2 influenza viruses in Korean pigs in 2013 contained HA from a Eurasian avian-like H1 swine influenza virus and NA genes from swine H1N2 influenza viruses circulating in Korean pigs [30, 31] . The internal genes of these isolates were derived from circulating triple-reassorted H3N2 swine influenza viruses containing an M gene from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, which were found to be circulating in pigs in North America [30, 31] . H1N2 swine influenza virus A/swine/Korea/VDS1/2010, which was isolated from Korean pigs in 2010, contained HA and NA genes from circulating swine influenza viruses, whereas the rest of the genes were from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [27] . H1N1 influenza virus A/swine/Korea/61/2016, which was isolated from Korean pigs in 2016, had the HA gene from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, while the rest of the genes were from circulating swine influenza viruses [27] . To summarize, we think that the swine H1N2 influenza viruses in Korean pigs are continuously evolving by recombination with genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses.",
