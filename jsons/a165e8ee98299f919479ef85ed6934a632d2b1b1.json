The multi-agent description leads to study the evolution over time of a system of kinetic equations for the wealth densities of susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge towards a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class. 1 arXiv:2004.13620v1 [physics.soc-ph] 28 Apr 2020 J (t) J \u2208 {S, I, R} the solution to the system (4)-(6) with initial datum f \u221e J J \u2208 {S, I, R}, thus satisfying (25).

While this paper concentrates on the classical SIR dynamics, it can be easily extended to incorporate other epidemiological dynamics, like the classical endemic models [29] , or to couple the SIR dynamics with other social and economical phenomena of multi agent systems [35] . Resorting to SIR model means that we abstract away from disease related mortality. Clearly, this is a strong hypothesis, as it excludes demographic interaction. However, it is currently believed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is low enough to justify this assumption. In addition, the introduction of disease-related mortality introduces an additional state variable, population size, which makes the complete mathematical description of the economy at the end of the epidemic more complex.",

According to the classical SIR models [29] , agents in the system are split into three classes, the susceptible, who can contract the disease, the infectious, who have already contracted the disease and can transmit it, and the recovered, who are healed and immune or isolated. Consequently, with respect to the modeling assumptions made in [14] , the forthcoming kinetic model is composed by a system of three kinetic equations, each of one describing the time evolution of the wealth distribution density in the class, and taking into account both the movements of agents from one class to others, and the trading activity between agents of the same class or of different classes.",

In particular, since the saving is expected to change in response to disease incidence [25] , we will assume that agents in each class are represented by a different saving propensity. In addition, to take into account the variation of the market in presence of a reduced trading activity during the infectious disease, we introduce a variable in time variance of the random effects modeling the external market risks. Although the resulting model is particularly simplified compared to the complexity of the problem, its foundations are based on models that are currently references in their respective fields. From the epidemic side, SIR model is widely used in most applications (cf. [29] and the references therein). Also, from the side of statistical mechanics of multi-agent systems, the kinetic model introduced in [14] has been shown to flexible with respect to different problems coming from economy.",

In particular, it was obtained in [14] via an asymptotic procedure applied to a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for binary trading in presence of risks. Also, the same equation with a modified drift term appears when considering suitable asymptotics of Boltzmann-type equations for binary trading in presence of taxation, in the case in which taxation is described by redistribution operators introduced in [6, 19] . Systems of Fokker-Planck equations have been considered in [20] to model wealth distribution in different countries which are coupled by mixed trading, and to study the evolution of wealth in a society with agents using personal knowledge to trade [36] .

In order to simplify the treatment, in this work we focus on the assumption that it is the state of health that changes people's behavior in the economic field. This assumption is justified both thinking that susceptible people understand that consuming and working less reduces the probability of becoming infected, and the country does not have a government funded health care system. More generally, the model can be clearly extended to consider more realistic dependencies on the wealth of individuals. However, this does not change the essential conclusions of our analysis, namely that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge towards a stationary state with a bimodal form [26, 28] .",

Then, the qualitative analysis of the system of kinetic equation is briefly presented in Section 2.2. For a better reading, the mathematical details leading to the main results of this Section are postponed to the Appendix A. In Section 3 we will show that in a suitable asymptotic procedure the solution to the kinetic system tends towards the solution of a system of three SIR-type Fokker-Planck type equations. Once the system of Fokker-Planck type equations has been derived, we recover in a simplified case the explicit steady state of the wealth distribution, which is found to have a bimodal shape. In Section 4 we will investigate at a numerical level the relationships between the solutions of the kinetic system of Boltzmann type and its Fokker-Plack asymptotics. Simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristic of the economic trend in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, like the unequal impact over the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class.",

The trade between agents have been modeled to include the idea that wealth changes hands for a specific reason: one agent intends to invest his wealth in some asset, property etc. in possession of his trade partner. Typically, such investments bear some speculative risk, and either provide the buyer with some additional wealth, or lead to the loss of wealth in a non-deterministic way. An easy realization of this idea consists in coupling the saving propensity parameter [10, 11] with some risky investment that yields an immediate gain or loss proportional to the current wealth of the investing agent. Hence 0 < \u03bb J < 1, j \u2208 {S, I, R} are the parameters which identify the saving propensities 1 \u2212 \u03bb J , namely the intuitive behavior which prevents the agents to put in a single trade the whole amount of his money. The choice \u03bb R > \u03bb S , for example, reflects the fact that susceptible individuals can be more cautious in the market and tend to save their wealth, since they understand that consuming and working less reduces the probability of infection [21] . On the other hand, infectious individual have limited possibilities to act on the market and, as we will see, asymptotically disappears from the wealth dynamic.",

Interactions between individuals with the same status (homogeneous interactions) and interactions between individuals with different status (heterogeneous interactions). Consider the first case, for example, the wealth interaction between susceptible individuals. The role of the risk variables \u03b7 SS and \u03b7 SS , for J = S in (8) have been clarified in [32] resorting to a specific choice. The easiest one leading to interesting results is \u03b7 SS = \u00b1\u03be where each sign comes with probability 1/2. The factor \u03be \u2208 (0, \u03bb S ), should be understood as the intrinsic risk of the market: it quantifies the fraction of wealth agents are willing to 'gamble' on. Within this choice, one can display the various regimes for the steady state of wealth in dependence of \u03bb = \u03bb S and \u03be (see Figure 1 ). In the zone corresponding to low market risk, the wealth distribution shows a 'socialistic' behavior with slim tails. Increasing the risk, one falls into a 'capitalistic' zone, where the wealth distribution displays a Pareto fat tail. A minimum of saving (\u03bb > 1/2) is necessary for this passage; this is expected since if wealth is spent too quickly after earning, agents cannot accumulate enough to become rich. Inside the capitalistic zone, the Pareto index decreases from +\u221e at the border with the socialist zone to unity. Finally, one can obtain a steady wealth distribution which is a Dirac delta located at zero. Both risk and saving propensity are so high that a marginal number of individuals manages to monopolize all of the society's wealth.",

Let us consider, for example, the interaction between susceptible and recovered individuals in (8) for J = R. Compared to the previous dynamics between only susceptible agents, if we assume \u03bb R = \u03bb S + \u03b4, \u03b4 > 0 it is evident that the risk of loss of recovered becomes \u03b4 +\u03b7 SR and has no more zero average.

In this sense, the original wealth model [14] is not conservative at the binary trade level since it allows the random stochastic multiplicative process to produce wealth, therefore taking into account not only exchanges but also production. However, its asymptotic analysis in a conservative context makes it possible to identify the observed stylized facts of a real economy, such as the formation of power law tails in the wealth distribution [32, 34] .",

In detail, the top line shows the case \u03bb S = \u03bb R = 0.1 and the bottom line \u03bb R = 0.1 = 2\u03bb S . We can see that in both cases the pandemic can also strongly change the transitional wealth distribution regimes.

We clearly observe an inequality of wealth that grows with the epidemiological dynamics.

In Figure 6 , we show the course of the infection over time. The image on the right shows the relative number of sensitive, recovered and infected subjects, while the image on the left shows the number of infected by social class. These are divided into three classes: working class, middle class and upper class as defined by (45) and (46). The recovery rate is set equal for the whole population to \u03b3 = 0.3. We see clearly how the infection affects people with a lower level of wealth. As for wealth, we choose constant transaction coefficients \u03bb S = \u03bb R as well as constant market risk \u03c3 = 0.1. In Figure 7 , we report the Gini index and the trend of the percentage of agents belonging to the middle class for four different scenarios. These are in addition to the one described above regarding the influence of epidemics on market risk as in (43) . First we consider the last case when the agents behave differently based on whether they belong to sensitive, infected or recovered subjects with \u03bb S = 0.025 < \u03bb R = 0.1, and constant \u03c3 = 0.1. In this scenario scenario, the disease does not change Gini's index. On the other hand, for the other three cases the index shows a clear impoverishment of the population. In particular, for the case in which the market is affected by the instantaneous spread of the epidemic in absence of memory effect, the index trend shows that after some time the level of wealth returns to the original situation. This is not the case when the market maintains the memory of the epidemic and when agents behave differently according to their state of health. Looking at the number of agents belonging to the middle class, we realize that the number of people who can be considered as belonging to this class decreases with time in only two situations, while it seems to remain lower than before the epidemic only if the market keeps the memory of the spread of the disease.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has in fact highlighted the importance of having models capable of describing the social and economic impact of the spread of the disease, albeit in a simplified way. The increase in social inequalities, the reduction of the middle class and the diversified impact of the epidemic on different social classes are phenomena typically observed in these conditions and that we have shown the model is able to describe. In addition to the modelling aspects, in the present work we included a qualitative analysis which shows that in a certain range of the parameters the kinetic wealth distribution system is well-posed, it has a unique solution for a large class of initial data, and the large-time behavior of this solution is found in a universal steady state. Explicitly computable stationary solutions have been evaluated by resorting to an asymptotic description of the kinetic system, which is expressed by a system of Fokker-Planck type equations. Finally, we note that the modelling approach just described can be easily adapted to more realistic compartmental models in epidemiology such as SEIR and/or MSEIR, including additional social effects, such as the age of agents [29] . Nevertheless, the fundamental aspects of the interaction between wealth and spread of infectious disease will not change. These generalizations and related numerical simulations will be the subject of future research.",
