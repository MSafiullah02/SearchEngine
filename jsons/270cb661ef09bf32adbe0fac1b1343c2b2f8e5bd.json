The incubation period from exposure to illness averages 2-3 days KEYWORDS influenza respiratory virus respiratory tract illness ABSTRACT Influenza A and B viruses are orthomyxoviruses with three important envelope glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix proteins. Influenza viruses have developed ways to evade the body's immune response using an antigenic variation known as antigenic shift (replacement of HA and NA antigens with novel subtypes from noninfluenza viruses) and drift (mutations within antibody-binding sites in HA and or NA). Because of new influenza viruses constantly emerging from antigenic shift and drift, new influenza vaccines are required each year. Human-to-human transmission of influenza occurs each winter and early spring through small-particle aerosols or droplets. The influenza virus attacks epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with the potential for secondary bacterial infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The symptoms of influenza infection include fever, headache, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract manifestations such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis are virtually indistinguishable from other viral infections. Children with certain comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease and severe neurologic impairment, are at higher risk of influenza-related complications. The most reliable test for influenza is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid antigen tests have lower sensitivity and specificity and are not reliable during periods of low influenza activity. Antiviral treatment with NA inhibitors can shorten the duration of fever, symptoms, and hospitalization, especially when started within 48 hours of influenza illness onset. Prevention of influenza through annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all children 6 months of age and older. The vaccines contain three or four influenza subtypes, chosen depending on the circulating strains. The two formulations approved for children are the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). a Although all children below 5 years of age are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "immune responses). [8] [9] [10] 13 In response to infections, activated macrophages and neutrophils work to eliminate viral particles and damaged or apoptotic epithelial cells. Although this is a key element in viral elimination and the recovery of epithelial integrity, the inflammatory by-products-such as myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastases, and increased nitric oxide synthase-may cause further injury to the airway. 8, 9 Increased risk of secondary bacterial infection may be due to delayed epithelial healing after influenza infection, excessive interferon gamma production, and type I interferons. 8, 9 The majority of systemic symptoms observed in acute influenza infection are attributable to the cytokines produced and released during the host immune response. Viremia is uncommon in an immunocompetent host. Similarly, dysfunction in nonrespiratory organs-such as myocarditis, encephalopathy, encephalitis, and rhabdomyolysis-is not usually associated with viral infection in those tissues. 9 Viral infections can also stimulate the Th2 arm of the immune system by producing thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, and IL-33. TSLP stimulates dendritic cells to induce Th2 cells and predisposes the host to allergic airway inflammation and asthma. IL-25 and IL-33 stimulate type 2 cytokine-producing innate lymphoid cells (ILC-2) to synthesize IL-5 and IL-13, which are promoters of eosinophilic inflammation, excessive mucus secretion, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

Chemoprophylaxis is not usually recommended if more than 48 hours have elapsed since the last exposure to an infected person. For effective prophylaxis, an antiviral medication must be taken each day for the duration of potential exposure to a person with influenza and continued for 7 days after the last known exposure. Postexposure prophylaxis should be considered for family members and close contacts of infected patients if they are at high risk of complications from influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS"}, {"text": "With or without antiviral treatment, most children have a full and uneventful recovery after an acute, uncomplicated influenza infection. Unfortunately, some will have a fatal outcome. Death from influenza is more frequent in children with comorbidities such as asthma or severe neurologic impairment and in those who develop ARDS. 66 A small proportion of children may develop asthma after experiencing an acute influenza infection, although asthma subsequent to infection seems with severe influenza infection. Furthermore, studies indicate an increase in overall mortality, increased incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in patients treated with steroids. 61, 62 Prevention Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all children 6 months of age and older. Ideally, vaccination should occur before the onset of influenza in the community and should be administered as soon as a vaccine supply is available. Vaccination should be continued as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Multiple different vaccine formulations are available, and some are licensed for specific age groups or are more appropriate for particular patient populations. Recommendations regarding influenza and vaccine dosing are updated by the CDC each year and are available via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/); they are also published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report by the CDC. 63, 64 Two formulations of vaccine are approved for children: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and liveattenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). LAIV is an intranasal vaccine and is offered solely in quadrivalent form. IIV is available in trivalent or quadrivalent formulations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that LAIV should not be used until further notice due to low vaccine effectiveness against influenza A during the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 seasons.
