            "text": "The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a noncytopathic DNA virus that causes both acute and chronic liver disease. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine for more than two decades, hepatitis B remains one of the 10 most common causes of death worldwide. Recovery from acute hepatitis B is the result of a combination of cellular and humoral immune responses. After recovery, HBV-specific T cells persist in the blood for decades [1]. In contrast, in chronic HBV infection, HBV-specific cellular immune responses are typically weak, narrowly focused, and rarely detectable in the peripheral blood [2], [3], [4], [5]. It has been suggested that therapeutic induction of HBV-specific cellular immune responses may lead to recovery from chronic hepatitis B [3]. However, currently traditional immuno-therapeutic approaches do not induce HBV-specific cellular immunity. Data demonstrating that cellular antiviral immunity can be induced following genetic immunization with plasmid DNA encoding HBV antigens have inspired novel approaches for vaccine construction [3], [4], [5]. The use of DNA vaccines in preclinical studies has been well established, with reports of both antibody and CTL responses in multiple independent studies [6]. Nevertheless, DNA vaccines have been met with limited success in both nonhuman primate models and human volunteers and often require multiple high dose immunizations [7]. For reasons such as potency, production, cost, and safety, there is a clear need to induce effective immunity in humans with lower and fewer doses of DNA, as well as to increase the magnitude of the immune response obtained.",

Several groups have attempted to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines using cationic microparticles [8], chitosan [9], non-ionic block co-polymers [10] and cationic liposomes [11], [12] as gene vectors. Although such approaches have had some success, they are far from ideal for enhancing cellular immunity because activation of T-cell responses requires antigen presentation by professional APCs. Targeting phagocytic APCs has resulted in more efficient immune activation than direct injection of equivalent amounts of free antigen [13]. For example, biodegradable microspheres are efficiently phagocytosed by macrophages (M\u03a6s) and capable of inducing a cytotoxic T cell response in vivo\n[14], [15], [16]. These spheres in the range of 1\u201310 \u03bcm are too large to enter cells via endocytosis, and therefore passively \u201ctarget\u201d phagocytic cells such as DCs by size exclusion. Goh et al demonstrated that MHC-I restricted antigen presentation can be enhanced by using spheres that rapidly degrade in the lysosome leading to disruption of the lysosome. This leads to IL-6 secretion and a response approximately 40-fold higher than that achieved with DNA alone [17].",

Base on these ideas, we have developed a novel approach to prepare mannose-bearing chitosan biodegradable microspheres with entrapping PEI/DNA complexes in order to enhance delivery of DNA to APCs after i.m. injection. The use of microsphere systems based on biodegradable polymers such as chitosan can provide sustained pharmacological activity of DNA vaccines. Chitosan is a polycationic, biodegradable natural polymer with an extensive record of safe use for gene delivery systems [18], [19]. However, previous research described the entrapment of naked DNA inside the unmodified chitosan microspheres. There might be some disadvantages to these systems, such as the following: (i) the low in vivo and in vitro expression levels suggest that chitosan is unable to mediate lysosomal escape possibly due to limited buffering capacity. (ii) Being insoluble in aqueous media due to its crystalline structure, chitosan forms a very viscous solution even at low concentrations, and is only soluble in water containing acetic acid which may induce cytotoxicity [20], [21]. (iii) Once entrapped in microspheres, the rate of release of DNA is slow, limiting the amount of DNA available for transfection of target cells and induction of immune responses. The limited life span of APCs requires the release of the encapsulated material in a reasonable time frame.",

PEI was introduced to condense negatively charged DNA into nanomeric particles and imparted the microsphere system with strong buffer capacity over a broad pH range. Covalent attachment of mannose to the primary amine of chitosan improved hydrophilicity and biodegradation by the mannonyl group. This increased the hydrogen bonding between the mannonyl group and solvent and disturbed the hydrogen bonding between amino groups and N-acetyl groups of chitosan. Furthermore, microspheres attached with mannose can target the DCs and be internalized via recognition by the mannose receptor on the DC surface. After preparation and characterization, the microspheres were administered to experimental animals and immune responses were characterized.",

The reactions of mannose and chitosan yielded products with high degrees of substitution (DS) as determined by microanalysis. The water solubility of u-chitosan and m-chitosan was evaluated in various pH solutions (Table 1\n). Chitosan and its derivatives, synthesized in this study, were soluble in an aqueous acidic solution below pH 6.5. This was caused by the protonation of primary amino groups, thus indicating that a significant amount of d-glucosamine residues still remained for the unique solubility of chitosan. In our case, it was evident that m-chitosan derivatives were soluble in a slightly broader range of pH than u-chitosan. What's more, the pH range was extended as the DS increased, indicating that the enhanced hydrophilicity was attributed to the mannonyl group (Data not shown). This was expected because, while the d-glucosamines were consumed, the random distribution of mannonyl groups is considered to inhibit the formation of the ordered structure and increase the hydrogen bonding between mannonyl group and solvent.",

Lysozyme has been widely used to estimate the in vitro degradation behavior of chitosan since it is known to be ubiquitous in the body and to produce results correlated with in vivo degradation [27], [28]. In this study, u-chitosan and m-chitosan were incubated with lysozyme-containing acetate buffer (pH = 5.0) at 37 \u00b0C. A decrease in the viscosity of the polymer solution, resulting from the enzymatic degradation, was investigated as a function of time (Fig. 1\n). No significant decrease in viscosity was observed in the u-chitosan solution within 90 min (< 10%), whereas the solution of m-chitosan exhibited the rapid decrease in the viscosity just after 10 min due to hydrolysis in the presence of lysozyme (p\n < 0.001). The preservation of the viscosity of the u-chitosan solution can be attributed to the fact that u-chitosan has a small amount of N-acetylglucosamine residues that are susceptible to lysozyme. It was of interest that the m-chitosan derivatives with a higher DS showed a higher degradation rate, indicating that the mannonyl moieties in the chitosan enhanced the susceptibility to lysozyme (Data not shown). Lee et al\n[29] also reported that the chitosans with bulky side groups could be degraded readily in the presence of lysozyme.",

            "text": "The uptake and expression of naked plasmid in muscle cells may be related to muscle physiology and function, most likely via a receptor-mediated event involving the T tubules and caveolae. For naked DNA, the peak level of gene expression in muscle was found 1.7\u20132.5-fold lower than u-chitosan or m-chitosan microspheres (Fig. 5). Manthope et al\n[30] have demonstrated the rapid loss of plasmid from muscle after injection of plasmid. Their studies showed that greater than 95% of the plasmid appeared to be degraded by 90 min post-injection, as determined by Southern blotting. Thus, the very low transfection efficiency coupled with the rapid degradation and elimination of DNA from the muscle suggests that nuclease mediated degradation is a rate-limiting step for gene delivery into muscle cells. For chitosan microspheres, the hydrophobic nature of the chitosan may offer protection to the encapsulated DNA from nuclease attack. This increased stability may explain the increased levels of gene expression observed at days 7 and 14.",

In an extensive dose-response titration assessed by ELISA, naked DNA primed HBsAg-specific antibody response after four doses of DNA as high as 10 \u03bcg. In contrast, m-chitosan microspheres were effective at 1 \u03bcg, indicating a > 10 fold increase in DNA vaccine potency, based on the lowest dose of DNA required to prime a measurable response. The m-chitosan microspheres may increase the humoral response of naked DNA by extending its longevity in release kinetics and half-time. In addition, m-chitosan microspheres accelerated the antibody responses (data not shown). The detectable antibody responses against HBsAg were achieved within 5 weeks after injection of naked DNA at a 10 \u03bcg dose, whereas only 3 weeks were required for m-chitosan microspheres at the same dose. This acceleration by 2 weeks is statistically significant, and is of clinical interest whenever a rapid immune response is critical. In the past years, outbreaks of Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A have increased demands for vaccination strategies that rapidly induce immunity [31], [32]. The vaccine strategy described here enhances the humoral immune response to DNA vaccines, and increases the speed of immune induction that is of clinical interest.",

It is evident that the plentiful antigen presentation through intracellular DNA expression by APCs has polarized the immune response toward its cellular arm. Endogenous synthesis of foreign protein antigens is known to elicit class I-restricted CD8+ CTL responses.
