            "text": "Prediction of weaning failure, particularly in neurosurgical patients is challenging. Delayed weaning and extubation in acute brain injured patients increases the rate of mortality and prolongs length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) [1]. Similarly, early attempts of weaning are complicated by post-extubation respiratory dysfunction and reintubation, associated with increased mortality, higher rate of tracheostomy, increased duration of ventilatory support and prolonged length of ICU stay [2, 3]. The common reasons for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in neurosurgical patients include impaired neurological function, airway protection or raised intracranial pressure, in addition to cardiorespiratory abnormalities. The primary aim of care for these patients is to detect and prevent any secondary neurological insult while supporting systemic and neurological homeostasis. Hypoxia and hypercarbia are factors which need to be absolutely avoided while caring for such patients. Mechanical ventilation is continued until the patient is clinically stabilized and primary neurological damage has been taken care. Subsequently the transition from control ventilation to spontaneous ventilation begins [4, 5].",

These data also suggest that complete neurological recovery is not necessary to execute successful extubation [6, 7]. The aetiology for weaning failure from ventilatory support is usually multifactorial, involving composite interaction between cardiac and lung function. In ICU, utility of numerous respiratory indices to guide weaning process have been replaced by spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) [8, 9]. Apart from loss of lung aeration due to transition from prolonged mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing, there is increase LV preload and after load, and decrease in LV compliance. These factors may increase LV filling pressure leading to failure of weaning [10, 11].",

Assessment of lung aeration by ultrasonography is rapidly gaining significance in weaning protocol [13]. Apart from lung ultrasonography, the role of transthoracic echocardiography in successfully predicting weaning capability has been investigated in the recent times [14]. Cardiac related weaning failure may be due to systolic LV dysfunction or isolated diastolic dysfunction representing nearly 40% of all failed weaning [15, 16] The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the cardiorespiratory ultrasonographic parameters in patients being weaned and contrasting the trend of changes in those successfully completing SBT in comparison to SBT failure.",

It is difficult to differentiate incidence of cardiac or pulmonary related weaning failure, because the increase in cardiac and pulmonary load are strongly interconnected [24]. In a study by Soummer [13], patients with lower LUS had better aeration and patients with progressive higher LUS during SBT had progressive lung de-recruitment. Initiation of weaning in our study was based on a clinical decision of treating intensivist, assuming that the respiratory condition has been optimally stabilised. However, without objective evidence, the process of weaning may be initiated far before normalization of pulmonary function. SBT failure or extubation failure is likely due to inadequate lung reaeration at the time of SBT. Lung ultrasonography provides a reliable method to estimate regional aeration of lung [19, 20]. Literature suggests transition from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing is linked with increased cardiac preload and after load [14, 25]. Similar to our study results, literature suggests there are significant changes in doppler mitral flow indexes (increase in E/A, E/E\u2032 and decrease in DTE) following initiation of SBT, suggesting increase in left ventricular filling pressure [14, 26]. Integrative use of cardiothoracic chest ultrasound data may help in predicting SBT failure or post extubation distress in critically ill patients [27, 28].",

In this series 18.1% of SBT success patients had extubation failure. Reasons for reintubation included neurological deterioration (n = 2) and inability of the patient to manage excessive secretions after extubation (n = 2). Currently, indices intended to predict SBT failure are indirect evidence of loss of lung aeration such as oxygen saturation defect, tachypnoea to compensate minute ventilation, altered mental status, tachycardia and hemodynamic instability [24]. Direct assessment of regional lung aeration provides a major advantage in predicting SBT success. Lung ultrasound has replaced conventional radiological means of assessing lung aeration, because it is point of care, easily repeatable, non-invasive and highly predictable [20, 32]. Several trials have shown utility of lung ultrasound for lung re-aeration following antimicrobial therapy in ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) [33], assessing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone position induced lung recruitment [20] and resolution of pulmonary oedema [34]. Lung ultrasound based detection of SBT induced de-recruitment may not elicit the cause for aeration loss. The other probable factors involved in SBT induced lung aeration loss like fluid overload, massive pleural effusion, pulmonary infection, cardiac dysfunction, copious bronchial secretions and diaphragmatic dysfunction should be screened simultaneously and managed accordingly.",

Before generalising the results of this study, a randomized, multicentre interventional study is required to assess the impact of combined cardiothoracic chest ultrasound monitoring during SBT. In this study a single investigator performed ultrasound examination who had 12 months experience in lung cardiac ultrasound. Trials have shown the learning curve for gaining skills in chest ultrasonography ranges from 3 weeks to 7 months based on the expertise level [35\u201337]. In SBT failure group, we were unable to differentiate the major contributor\u2014lung aeration loss or increased LV filling pressure or a combined effect. The criteria for failure to tolerate SBT was based on clinical judgement (parameters include change of level of consciousness, clinical features of respiratory distress, and haemodynamic instability). Another objective assessment determining failure of SBT, like arterial blood gas analysis was not used in this study during SBT. We did not evaluate biological markers of cardiovascular system during SBT like circulating B-type and atrial natriuretic peptides (BNP, ANP) to predict weaning success [11].",
