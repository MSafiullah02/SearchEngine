As of Feb, 21th 2020, the virus has affected 3,019 healthcare workers (HCWs) with 5 deaths [2] . The fact that HCWs are at risk of infection in the epidemic chain is a critical issue because HCWs help in controlling the outbreak. Therefore, all possible actions must be taken to control the spread of the infection to HCWs, first by identifying the risk factors for infection and then by taking appropriate measures to reduce these risks.",

However, this is likely compounded by the fact that some HCWs have inadequate awareness of infection prevention practices [3] . Knowledge of a disease can influence HCWs' attitudes and practices, and incorrect attitudes and practices directly increase the risk of infection [4] . Understanding HCWs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) and possible risk factors helps to predict the outcomes of planned behaviour. Thus, this study aimed to investigate KAP concerning patients infected with COVID-19 among HCWs. If HCWs' KAP concerning the virus and the factors that affect their attitudes and behaviours can be determined promptly in the early stages of the epidemic, then this information can inform relevant training and policies during the outbreak and guide HCWs in prioritising protection and avoiding occupational exposure.",

Henan is geographically close to Wuhan, an area critically affected by COVID-19, and many people from Wuhan travel to Henan before the Spring Festival. Next to Wuhan, Henan is the worst hit area in China. Thus, Henan province was selected as the setting to analyse HCWs' KAP. The China Health Statistics Yearbook [5], reports a total of 1825 general hospitals, 180,402 doctors, 263,100 nurses, and 103,306 paramedics registered in Henan province. Inquiry surveys were sent to all 1825 general hospitals in the province. Approximately 100 hospitals provided feedback and register data for their HCWs. An electronic survey was then sent to 10 hospitals (10%) to collect information on HCWs' KAP concerning COVID-19. These hospitals were selected based on the accessibility of the respondents (location, cooperation, and interest of the hospital management). All ten hospitals were public, accredited multi-speciality, tertiary care with 1800 to 10,000 beds. Data were collected from HCWs in medical and surgical wards and intensive care units using a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess KAP concerning COVID-19. All participants were guaranteed anonymity and they provided informed consent. During the study period, i.e. 4th February to 8th February, 2020, we received 1357 completed questionnaires.",

Doctors showed higher knowledge scores (38.56 \u00b1 3.31) than nurses (37.85 \u00b1 2.63) and paramedics (36.72 \u00b1 4.82). Knowledge is a prerequisite for establishing prevention beliefs, forming positive attitudes, and promoting positive behaviours, and individuals' cognition and attitudes towards disease affect the effectiveness of their coping strategies and behaviours to a certain extent [4] . This investigation similarly found that knowledge directly affected attitudes. The greater the HCWs' knowledge, the more confident they were in defeating the virus (OR = 1.411, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.123, 1.774). Additionally, HCWs with higher knowledge of COVID-19 believed that visitors with significant risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. close contact with a confirmed case, recent travel to an area with community transmission) should disclose their exposure (OR = 1.217, 95% CI: 1.041, 1.422). A previous study reported that in the initial outbreak of the virus at non-communicable diseases (NCDS), two-thirds of the 31 infected medical staff worked in general wards, 17.5% in the emergency department, and 5% in the ICU [9] . An important reason for early infection among general ward medical staff was that patients were admitted to the ward without protective measures in place. In contrast, infection rates in the more well-protected ICU and emergency departments were lower in cases with no early warning of the disease.",

In the isolation ward and ICU, where patients are seriously ill and have difficulty in breathing, HCWs assist patients in their daily tasks such as patient consultation, infusion, dressing changes, and surgery. They must also handle various emergency situations, and they can possibly be infected with the virus if they are not careful. This may explain why doctors feel more tired than paramedics feel tired during the outbreak (OR = 0.438, 95% CI: 0.256, 0.748), and overworked HCWs feel more tired after the outbreak than those who were not overworked (OR = 0.664, 95% CI: 0.460, 0.960).

Compared to frontline HCWs, non-frontline workers had lower confidence in defeating the virus (OR = 0.562, 95% CI: 0.376, 0.839) The motivation and optimism demonstrated by frontline HCWs are likely related to the materials and policies of the Chinese government regarding frontline support because frontline medical staff in China receive strong material support and care , and they are more confident in their ability to defeat the virus [7] .",

In the present study, 89.7% of the surveyed HCWs followed correct practices regarding COVID-19, consistent with research showing that practices are associated with work experience, working time, and other factors. Non-frontline HCWs were less likely to maintain quarantine with family (OR = 0.746, 95% CI: 0.591, 0.942), which could cause the worker to inadvertently infect family members; in contrast, quarantine with family was positively correlated with 5-9 years of work experience (OR = 1.538, 95% CI: 1.156, 2.045). Moreover, nurses must collect saliva samples from patients' pharyngeal isthmus; if they neglect their own protection to facilitate their work, then they may greatly increase the risk of infection among HCWs, and they are more vulnerable to infection if they do not wash their hands carefully and frequently [10] . Overworked HCWs washed their hands less frequently than those who were not overworked (OR = 0.705, 95% CI: 0.508, 0.978); to prevent virus transmission between HCWs, overworked workers should maintain appropriate working hours with breaks.
