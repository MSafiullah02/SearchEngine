The infection continues to spread rapidly worldwide and causes many people deaths. Patients with rheumatic disease can become easily and severely infected with SARS-CoV-2 because their immune system is suppressed [1] . Patients with rheumatic diseases use many immunosuppressants such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. It has been shown in many studies that hydroxychloroquine is effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection [2] . Tocilizumab is used for patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [2] . Steroids use is not recommended during SARS-CoV-2 infection since the drugs may increase the tendency to pneumonia [1] .",

            "text": "Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent and often uses for immunosuppression after organ transplantation. It is widely used in the treatment of vasculitis by rheumatologists [3] . Cyclosporine can be used in the treatments of Beh\u00e7et's disease, psoriatic arthritis, and lupus nephritis [3] . Nowadays, it is not used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [3] . Serious side effects of cyclosporine have limited its use. Administration of immunosuppressive agents inhibits the activation of T cells and render patients with rheumatic diseases susceptible to infections [1] . Therefore, it should be clarified whether cyclosporine can be used in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits calcium-dependent interleukin (IL)-2 production. It blocks the calcineurin activity by complexing with cyclophilin in the cell and suppresses gene transcription of IL-2. Cyclosporine has been shown to inhibit SARS-COV viral replication at very low and non-toxic doses [4] [5] [6] . Similarly, it inhibits the replication of other coronaviruses and human immune deficiency virus [5, 6] . Cyclosporine can inhibit cyclophilin functions of the SARS-COV virus by inhibiting the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity or may act by directly inhibiting the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the virus [6] . There is a resemblance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV based on the fulllength genome phylogenetic. Therefore, cyclosporine can be successful in SARS-CoV-2 treatment.",

The upregulation of ACE2 is thought to increase the viral load and exacerbate the disease [7] . Three important structures maintain cell pH. These ion regulators are lactate/H + ion symporter (also called monocarboxylate transporters), Na + /H + exchanger (NHE), and Cl \u2212 /HCO 3 \u2212 exchangers. Hydroxychloroquine does not affect any of these channels. It increases intracellular pH through hemi-gap junctional channels [8] . The SARS-CoV-2 infection creates a hypoxic environment by increase lactate. In anaerobic conditions, lactate formation increases by lactate dehydrogenase. MCT pumps lactate and H + ion simultaneously from the extracellular area to the cytosol to lower the elevated lactate level. NHE becomes active as a reflex due to the increase of H + ion in the cell [7] . After the activation of NHE, Na + and Ca +2 are introduced into the cell, while H + ion is pumped out of the cell. As this reaction continues, the cell continues to swell and lose its functions and eventually dies [7] . It seems that both MCT and NHE are active at the maximum level in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
