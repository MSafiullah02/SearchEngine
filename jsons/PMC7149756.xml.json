In Africa, many countries have faced severe challenges in controlling malaria, in part due to major limitations in public health systems and poor infrastructure. According to the World Malaria Report 2013 published by the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2012, there were an estimated 207 million cases of malaria (uncertainty interval 135\u2013287 million), which caused approximately 627,000 deaths (uncertainty interval 473,000\u2013789,000). An estimated 3.4 billion people continue to be at risk of malaria, mostly in Africa and southeast Asia. Approximately 80% of malaria cases and 90% of malaria deaths occurred in Africa (WHO, 2013).",

According to the statistics, more than 30 million malaria cases were recorded annually during the 1940s and the mortality rate was about 1%. After the establishment of P.R. China in 1949, the government invested significant resources in the control of malaria which was listed as one of the five top parasitic diseases in the country. The reduction of malaria leading to its elimination in P.R. China, the evidence-based prevention strategies, and related malaria prevention and control policies have been synthesised for the National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs). As a result, a network of scientific research and surveillance has been established, thousands of professional technical teams have been trained, and the coordination of malaria control within specific zones has been created for the past six decades. Through these interventions, a remarkable achievement of the NMCPs has taken place since the early 1950s. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the annual number of malaria cases significantly declined from 2.4 million to tens of thousands, the endemic regions were sharply shrunk, and falciparum malaria has been eliminated in all regions except for Yunnan and Hainan provinces. By 2009, the national number of malaria cases had been reduced to 14,000. Among 24 malaria-endemic provinces, the malaria incidence in 95% of the counties has dropped below 1 per 10,000 population with only 87 counties over 1 per 10,000. The data indicate that P.R. China has transitioned from malaria control phase to elimination phase (Tang, 1999; Tang, 2009).",

China by 2020 (National Health and Family Planning Commission of P.R. China, 2009).

In July 2012, the WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan emphasised the importance of health cooperation between Africa and China during her visit to P.R. China, and the Chinese leader of the central government gave a positive response. In early 2013, the government of P.R. China has promised to continue increasing its investment in Africa, which includes medical assistance as well as promotion of sustainable development (Wang, 2013). Recently, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (previously Ministry of Health) and the Ministry of Commerce of P.R. China have proposed to provide technical support for malaria control and elimination in Africa, which would further promote South\u2013South cooperation through mutual exchanges in the field of malaria control and elimination.\n",

The donation of antimalarial medicines, diagnostic kits and equipment, and the provision of experts and on-site training have demonstrated the increasing commitment on the part of the Chinese government to the malaria control and elimination programme in Africa. An outstanding example was Chinese government support in building antimalaria centres in 30 African countries and donating antimalarial medicines through bilateral cooperation since 2006 (Annex 1). Antimalaria centres have played not only a role in diagnosis and treatment, but also have contributed to communication and capacity building, including improvement of capacity in local medical research and treatment. Experiences with the malaria control centres are variable, e.g. some have been successful, while others are faced with the challenges of financing and the lack of local contribution. Another successful example was in Comoros, where a pilot malaria elimination programme had achieved a significant reduction in malaria transmission with the support of China (Chinese Medical Cooperation in Africa, 2011).",

A further two countries (Ethiopia and Zambia) are projected to achieve reductions in malaria admission rates of 50\u201375% by 2015, and one country (Madagascar) by <50%. An increase in locally acquired cases, from 35 in 2000 to 59 in 2012, was reported from Algeria. Cabo Verde is in the pre-elimination phase, and continues to progress towards eliminating malaria. Algeria is in the elimination phase. Both Algeria and Cabo Verde implement active case detection, case investigation and a quality assurance (QA) system for diagnostic testing guided by a national reference laboratory; they also provide treatment with primaquine for the radical cure of P. vivax and clearance of gametocytes in P. falciparum infections. Eight countries in southern Africa are signatories to the elimination eight (E8) regional initiative launched in March 2009, a goal of which is to achieve the eventual elimination of malaria in the region, with elimination in four countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland) by 2015. With continued investments in malaria control, it is expected that these countries will continue to progress towards elimination, although they do not yet meet the case management and surveillance criteria to be classi\ufb01ed as being in the pre-elimination phase.",

Most malaria infections in Africa south of the Sahara are caused by P. falciparum, the most severe and life-threatening form of the disease. This region is also home to the most efficient, and therefore deadly, species of mosquitoes that transmit the disease. Moreover, in many African countries, especially in rural areas, poor infrastructure, substandard sanitation, and lack of funding for vector control, diagnostic testing and treatment remain challenges (Agomo et al., 2013; Butler, 2012). Many countries lacked the infrastructure and resources necessary to mount sustainable campaigns against malaria; as a result, few benefited from historical efforts to eradicate malaria. In Africa, malaria is understood to be both a disease of poverty and a cause of poverty (Ajayi et al., 2013, BiTong and AuthorAnonymous, 2014). Annual economic growth in countries with high malaria transmission has historically been lower than in countries without malaria. Malaria also has a direct impact on Africa\u2019s human resources. Not only does malaria result in lost life and lost productivity due to illness and premature death, but malaria also hampers children\u2019s schooling and social development through both absenteeism and permanent neurological and other damage associated with severe episodes of the disease (Malaria in Africa; Chima et al., 2003).",

According to the World Malaria Report 2013 (WHO, 2013), an assessment of trends was not possible in 32 countries in Africa owing to insufficiently consistent data, and the scale-up of diagnostic testing through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopy remains incomplete in the public sector and to an even greater extent in the private sector. In 17 countries of Western Africa, the proportion of the population with access to an insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) within their household was estimated to exceed 50% in 10 countries, the use of indoor residual spraying (IRS) has increased but coverage remains relatively low, and only seven countries reported delivering sufficient antimalarial medicines to treat all patients attending public health facilities. In 10 countries of Central Africa, the recent increase in malaria cases and admissions in Sao Tome and Principe may be related to brief disruptions to spraying activities and supply of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs); the proportion of the population with access to an ITN within their household was estimated to exceed 50% in five countries; and Angola and Burundi reported delivery of sufficient ACTs to treat >50% patients attending the public health facilities. In 11 countries of eastern and southern Africa, the proportion of the population with access to an ITN in their household was estimated to exceed 50% in nine countries; only Mozambique distributed insufficient ACTs to treat all patients attending public health facilities. In five low-transmission southern Africa countries, the number of people with access to an ITN in their household was estimated to exceed 50% in three countries. IRS is the primary vector control measure in South Africa, and South Africa and Swaziland reported inadequate access to antimalarial medicines.",

In the aftermath of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the Chinese government strengthened its public health disease surveillance system, taking advantage of modern information technology to build an integrated, effective and reliable disease reporting system, the national Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS). This system gathers real-time epidemiologic information on approximately 40 infectious diseases, including malaria, across every province from every hospital and clinic. Based on NIDRIS, a new nationwide web-based automated system for outbreak detection and rapid response, namely the China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS), was developed in 2008. In CIDARS, three aberration detection methods are used to detect the unusual occurrence of 28 notifiable infectious diseases at the county level and transmit information either in real time or on a daily basis. The Internet, computers and mobile phones are used to accomplish rapid signal generation and dissemination, timely reporting and reviewing of the signal response results, which greatly improved the timeliness of malaria case or epidemic detection and response (Yang et al., 2011). In 2010, when P. R. China started NMEP another web-based reporting system specific to malaria was set up to provide more detailed information on malaria patients and antimalarial interventions.",
