One of the most promising is Remdesivir, a drug developed to treat ebola virus (it did not), that has not yet been fully studied. The preliminary reports indicate activity vs COVID-19 and some efficacy.",

The AIDS epidemic also took the world by storm, first recognized in 1981 and without any \"proven\" treatment for several years. A drug, 3'-deoxy-3'-aido-thymidine, sitting on the shelves of the NCI since the 1960s when it failed as a chemotherapeutic agent against cancer, was tested, shown to have beneficial effects at shutting down HIV replication in the laboratory and in a limited trial. In 1986, a randomized clinical trial documented that it did stop HIV. This compound, named zidovudine, rapidly entered clinical use, although there were skeptics. Unfortunately, zidovudine was potentially toxic and its benefit was short lived as the HIV would escape control through mutation. But zidovudine did show the way, many other drugs followed, and in 1996, thanks to the benefit of new assays and laboratory tools to guide treatment, we were able to combine drugs and achieve lasting control of HIV. A different virus, a different epidemic, but a similar first step although as of this writing, we are unsure if this will end the lethal effects of covid-19 infection.",

From our understanding of the covid19 disease is that its lethality often stems from an aggressive host response with a cytokine storm in which the host response kills the patient. One can reasonably posit that the time to use the drug is early in the infection before the patient is severely ill. But we do not know this. 4. The drug exists only in a form that must be given by intravenous infusion. This is acceptable for the ill hospitalized patient, but not so for the patient with minimal symptoms 5.
