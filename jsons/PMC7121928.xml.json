            "text": "RNA viruses are ideal model organisms to study evolutionary genetics under selection. This is due to their large population sizes and short generation times, which are characterized by rapid accumulation of mutations relative to other organisms. Given the error-prone nature of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, viral replication leads to the formation of a quasispecies [1\u20133]. Rather than one virus producing identical progeny during replication, a population of viruses is produced, each differing from one another by nucleotide substitutions or deletions as a result of errors incorporated by the RNA polymerase. While the majority of these mutations will have neutral or negative effects on viral fitness, a small subset of these mutations may prove beneficial and enhance the ability for certain variants to replicate despite selective pressures of interest such as the host immune response or an antiviral drug. Forced adaptation experiments have been used to determine viral mutations that facilitate escape from drugs [4\u20136], monoclonal antibodies [7, 8], host restriction factors [9\u201311], and species variation in host receptors [12\u201314] and to elucidate various viral mechanisms of infection and replication [15\u201317].",

This midlevel expression is ideal for semi-permissive selective pressure created by the transgene, in this case, drDPP4 .The plating density of cells may vary from this suggested value, depending on growth kinetics. In general, cells should be plated to achieve approximately 80\u201390% confluency on the day of infection.Cytopathic effects may be gradual to appear. To increase selective pressures on a viral population which is beginning to show signs of adaptation, one can apply a population bottleneck in the subsequent passage by reducing the amount of viral supernatant passaged to the next cell culture. In this case, we recommend reducing the passage volume by approximately tenfold.In our initial study [12], cytopathic effects were observed by the eighth passage; however, sequencing from earlier passages showed adaptive mutations emerging in the culture by the third passage. Depending on the strength of selection, the number of passages required to elicit adaptive mutations will vary.\n",
