The new surveillance system was implemented formally in 2004. The new surveillance system has played an important role in detecting infectious diseases in a timely fashion, which has helped to protect the lives and health of the entire population and has reduced the economic and health impacts of the diseases on the whole of society. This new system is the largest infectious disease surveillance system covering the largest population in the world.2 It has become possible to detect more infections and the data have become more complete and reliable since the new reporting system was established.3 A survey showed that the average omission rate was 13% among the medical institutions throughout the country; the compliance rate for outpatient daily registration was 96%, the registry integrity rate was 97%, and the timely reporting rate for the medical institutions was 91%.4\n",

Statistical modelling has been used previously to summarize the time series behaviour of disease.6 In the current study, the monthly time series data for 28 class B infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 were collected. The class B infectious diseases were selected for study, as most of these diseases occur more frequently than class A diseases and they cause more severe epidemics than class C diseases. Class B infectious diseases are the main focus of the surveillance process. A descriptive analysis and time series study was performed.7 Decomposition methods were used to analyse the seasonal pattern and long-term trends of the class B notifiable infectious diseases for the years 2005\u20132014.",

The decomposition methods have been reported in previous studies.6, 8 Decomposition breaks down the underlying patterns of time series into seasonality and long-term trends. The seasonal trend in the infection series can be expressed using seasonal indices. To calculate the seasonal factors, overall incidences are first averaged, and then the averaged incidence is divided by the mean incidence for each month. For example, the average incidence of malaria was 0.1344/100 000 during the 10 years and the mean incidence in May was 0.1059/100 000, thus the seasonal index for May is 0.788 (0.1344/0.1059). Seasonality shows the periodic fluctuations that are usually caused by known factors such as rainfall, temperature, timing of the holidays, etc. If the seasonal index is greater than 1, it means that the incidence is higher than the average level. Otherwise, it means that the incidence is lower than the average level. The trend cycle represents the long-term changes in the infection. After the seasonal indices have been calculated, one can deseasonalize the data by dividing by the corresponding index. A linear regression model is a simple way to express the long-term trend, in which a common linear regression model is established between the deseasonalized incidence and time t.",

The number of reported syphilis cases increased 3.26 times from 135 210 in 2005 to 441 818 in 2014. The first AIDS case in China was reported in 1985, and the first HIV epidemic was identified in 1989 when a group of HIV infections was detected in Yunnan Province.9 Fewer than 20 000 HIV/AIDS cases were reported before 2000, and the number rose to 780 000 in 2012. It was estimated that 780 000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in China in 2012.10 It has been reported that HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been rising in China, with an estimated prevalence rate of 7.3% in 2013.11 MSM represent over a quarter of new reported infections; however studies aimed at understanding the epidemic in this population are extremely limited. Another great concern is that the prevalence of AIDS among young people has increased rapidly in China. It has been reported that the prevalence among 15\u201324-year-olds doubled from 0.9% to 1.7% between 2008 and 2012.11 Research reported by Tucker et al. indicated that very few Chinese people with symptoms of a STD sought medical attention 10\u201315 years ago.12 If people have become more likely to seek medical attention for these diseases in recent years, then this could have contributed in part to the increase in reported AIDS and syphilis cases seen in the current study.",

It was reported that the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases in 2005, which greatly facilitated the treatment and prevention of this disease.14 Among all the class B diseases, tuberculosis ranked number one in terms of the number of cases in every year from 2005 to 2014.

Some of the infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles, showed more obvious seasonality.
