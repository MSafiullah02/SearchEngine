Mass media is playing a key role in making the public aware of the disease and its transmissibility and severity. Motivated by the importance of heterogeneous risk perception in the population to response to infectious disease outbreaks (particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we propose a heterogeneous three-layer network model, namely the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Unaware-Aware-Protected (SEIR-UAP) model, where people's vulnerability to the disease is influenced by the processes of awareness information diffusion, preventive behavior change and infectious disease transmission. Analytical and simulation results are presented to validate the model. We found that (a) the awareness of the disease plays the central role in preventing disease outbreak; (b) we need a reasonable ratio of \"over-reacting\" nodes to effectively control the disease outbreak; (c) diseases with a longer incubation period and a higher recovery rate are easier to control because the processes of information diffusion and behavior change can help people prepare for the upcoming exposure to the disease; (d) it is more difficult to control the disease with asymptomatic cases. The results provide evidence that mass media should not play down the transmissibility and severity of diseases, so that the public can become aware of the disease as soon as possible.",

In a multiplex network, we assume that there exist the spreading processes of both information and infection, represented by multiple layers of the network. For example, the UAU-SIS (susceptibleinfected-susceptible unaware-aware-unaware) model, proposed by Granell et al., is able to capture the critical point of disease outbreak determined by the topological structure of the virtual contact network formed by the information propagation [20] . It can be extended to many model variants, such as the multiple-information model, which incorporates more than one type of information [21] , the local awareness controlled contagion spreading model [22] , in which the awareness transition is further influenced by the extent of the awareness of all neighbors, and an SIR-UA (susceptible-infected-recovered unaware-aware) model, which considers all possible schemes of dynamics [23] . In addition to information and disease transmissions, some studies also considered the transmission of preventive behavior in an simulation study [24] .",

People's willingness to take self-protection behaviors and to share disease-related information can be influenced not only by the transmissibility and severity of the disease as reported by the mass media, but also by the personal risk perception, which is the subjective judgement about the transmissibility and severity of the disease [33, 34, 35] . Similar to smart nodes in information diffusionRuan paper ref [36] , those individuals who are more fearful of being infected are found to be more actively engaging in self-protections and information sharing. We label these people as \"over-reacting\" as compared to those \"under-reacting\" people, who have a lower risk perception. While others who are less willing to do such things are \"under-reacting\". This is of particular relevance to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID- 19) , in which a clear disparity in risk perception caused diverse reaction to control measures [37, 38, 39, 40] . The lessons we learned from COVID-19 outbreak in many countries is that, making the public aware of the disease is not sufficient, it is very important to understand how to increase the ratio of \"overreacting\" people in the population via media reporting.",

The aim of our study is to describe how different types of nodes (\"over-reacting\" versus \"under-reacting\") shape the prevalence of preventive behaviors and affect the natural course of diseases. The contribution of this study is threefold: First, this is the first study that considers both the risk perception and the awareness of diseases. Second, we considers the heterogeneity in the response to the awareness information of the disease. This heterogeneity in the response comes from the heterogeneity in the distribution of the risk perception among nodes. Third, we study analytically and numerically the effect of such heterogeneity on the epidemic process.",

The final ratio of nodes \u03c1 S (\u221e) is shown in Fig. 4 with respect to the infection rate \u03b2 I and the ratio of \"over-reacting\" nodes a for different values of \u03c3 and \u03b3. Similar to Fig. 3 , the ratio of \"over-reacting\" nodes has an S-shape effect on the final ratio of susceptible nodes regardless of the value of parameters on the Disease Transmission Layer, but the corresponding range of a for each stage is different, as shown in Fig. 4 . We find that \u03c1 S (\u221e) generally has three phases: when a is small, \u03c1 S (\u221e) is close to 0; when a is large, \u03c1 S (\u221e) is close to 1. There exists a threshold that triggers the rapid increase of \u03c1 S (\u221e). The exact value of the threshold cannot be analytically obtained. This indicates that by increasing the ratio of \"over-reacting\" nodes through highlighting the transmissibility and severity of the disease in media reporting, we can largely prevent the disease outbreak. More importantly, as long as the ratio of \"over-reacting\" nodes reaches the threshold, we do not need to increase the media reporting too much as the benefits of doing so is not slim. This finding is interesting because it shows that, disease outbreak is preventable if the mass media is playing an effective role of the whistle-blower.",

Furthermore, we explore the effects of \"over-reacting\" nodes for various parameter settings on the Disease Transmission Layer.

If the transmissibility and severity is played down by the mass media, more people will remain \"under-reacting\" and thus more people being infected eventually. However, if the mass media report unreasonably high transmissibility and severity of the disease, the \"crying wolf\" effect could result in people losing confidence in the public health system.
