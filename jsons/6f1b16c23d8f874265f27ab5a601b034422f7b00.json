Especially notable were the demonstrations that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase may have a function in RNA synthesis as an uncleaved precursor polypeptide, and that a mutation in the polymerase can be complemented in trans, in contrast to data obtained from previously studied polymerase mutants. A new in vitro system, in which positive-strand sythesis, negative-strand synthesis and RNA packaging were all observed, will facilitate further studies into the mechanism of these processes.",

The study of genetics in the system can be divided into two subdisciplines. The tools and logic of the genetic system may be used to investigate the biochemistry of individual proteins or RNAs and their interactions with other gene products. Ahemaflvely, the primary focus of a study may be the processes of transmission genetics: genome replication, complementation and recombination. This review highlights some of the genetic processes that occur in picornaviruses, and the functions of individual viral polypeptides are discussed. Models demonstrating the dependence of RNA synthesis on translation of template RNA are presented.",

The 5' non-coding regions of picomaviral RNAs vary from 600-1200 nucleotides in length, and must perform at least two functions. At the 5' end of the viral mRNAs, sequences from 140-630, 403-811 and 369-805 in poliovirus [16] , encephalomyocarditis virus [17] and foot-and-mouth disease virus [18, 19] , respectively, confer the ability for picomaviral RNAs to be translated in cells by the unusual mechanism of internal ribosome binding. RNA sequences and factors mediating this process are under intense scrutiny; the state of this research has been recently reviewed [20\" ]. Cap-independent translation mediated by internal binding of ribosomes to specific sequences in 5' non-coding sequences was thought, until this year, to be limited to the picornaviruses. Macejack and Samow [21oo], however, report that a cellular RNA, encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein, can be translated by internal ribosome binding as well. Thus, picornaviruses did not 'invent' a new mechanism of translation, but hijacked one used by cellular messages [21o\u00b0]. Sequences in the 5' non-coding region outside the intemal ribosome binding region are also important for translation initiation in poliovirus. A small-plaque mutant whose genome harbors a small insertion at nucleotide 21 clearly displays a primary defect in translation [22] .",

Clever mutagenesis, creating G-U base pairs on one strand and C-A mismatches on its complement, was used to test whether the RNA structure was functionally required in its positive-or negative-strand version. Quite surprisingly, the intricate clover-leaf structure seems to be needed, not at the 3' end of the negative strand from which RNA synthesis must initiate, but at the 5' end of the positive strarid! The phenotypes of mutants showed that the requisite function is in RNA synthesis, specifically in positive-strand synthesis (although this latter suggestion comes only from measuring the steady-state ratio of positive to negative strands in non-conditional mutants). Taken together, these findings suggest that the structure of the extreme 5' end of the poliovirus positive strand may be important for its own synthesis, either as a nascent RNA or as the template of the template of nascent positive-strand RNAs [23\" ].",

Andino et at [23 \u00b0'] have identified at least one complex that appears to be required for poliovirus RNA synthesis. Using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, a complex formed in vitro between the RNA and either a host protein or proteins from both uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells has been identified [23\"'] . Using extracts from infected cells, a new complex was formed, and was found to contain 3CD, the uncleaved 'precursor' of both the 3D polymerase and the 3C protease. A role for 3C coding sequences in RNA synthesis had been anticipated by earlier work by Andino et al. [27] , who showed that certain phenotypic revertants of mutations in the 5' non-coding region clover-leaf RNA structure mapped to 3C. The recent work showed that mutations in the RNA cloverleaf or in the coding region of 3C resulted in the same in vitro phenotype (the loss of formation of the large complex), and similar in vivo defects in RNA synthesis [23\"'] . Therefore, there is abundant structural and genetic evidence demonstrating the existence of a functional complex between the 5'-most RNA sequences of the poliovirus positive strand and 3CD. Whether the host protein is still present in this larger complex has not yet been shown, but the idea remains tantalizing.",

The recessive alleles in the 5' non-coding region are 'complemented' by coinfecting viruses because of the increased inhibition of host protein synthesis during coinfection [51] . chetti and Semler [28] have reported another interesting example of a picomavirus mutant in a protein-coding region with a strand-specific defect in RNA synthesis. A mutant derived from a poliovirus cDNA bearing a mutation in the 3A coding region displayed defects in translation [29] and RNA replication [28] . The results of further in vivo and in vitro experiments are consistent with the idea that the primary defect of this mutant is in positive-strand synthesis. Unfortunately, the dot-blot analysis used in these studies for the quantitative deterruination of negative strands in the presence of excess positive strands can be quite misleading [30\" ]. Notwithstanding, this result suggests that the role of 3A, whose only suspected function is in the VPg precursor 3AB, may be more important in positive-than in negative-strand synthesis. That the two strands could be primed differently is quite conciliatory, given the controversy over the mechanism of RNA priming, which is discussed below.",

In this system, a translation-competent extract prepared from uninfected HeLa cells was programmed with positive-strand poliovirus RNA. Following incubation in vitro for 15 h, infectious poliovirions could be recovered. That the authors did not merely observe packaging of the RNA molecules that were added to the extract was argued by the presence of negative-strand RNA following, but not preceding, incubation. That de novo RNA synthesis occurred in these extracts was shown by the dependence of infectious virion production on the presence of all four dNTPs, and by the inhibition of virion production by guanidine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of picomavirus RNA synthesis in vivo. When the in vitro extracts were programmed with positive-strand RNA from a guanidine-resistant mutam, however, the synthesis of infectious virions was not inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride. This in vitro s~tern will provide a wealth of experimental information about the protein and RNA requirements for the initiation of positive-strand synthesis, negative-strand synthesis, RNA packaging and virion morphogenesis, as all these processes presumably occur in vitro, thus accounting for the production of infectious virus [31\"\u00b0] .",

Marc et al. [32] have pioneered the study of 'dead' mutants by investigating the assembly pathway in cells tmnsfected with mutant poliovirus RNA that does not give rise to viable virus. Using this technique, the role of myristoylation of capsid proteins 1A and lAB has been explored. In wild-type poliovirions, the amino-terminal glycine of 1A and lAB is myristoylated co-translationally [33] . Upon changing the terminal glycine to an alanine residue, myristoyiation was found to be totally abolished [32] . In this mutant, assembly about the fivefold axis (of pentameric intermediates) was found to be quite slow, and the few intact virion-like structures formed were not infectious. In mutants in which myristoylation is only 40-60% inhibited, Moscufo et aL [37] showed that myristoytated proteins were selected with a twofold preference in the assembly of the pentameric intermediates, and a 20-fold preference in intact, virion-like structures. Therefore, myristoytation is thought to be important at several stages of viral assembly [32, 37] . Interestingly, these in vivo studies demonstrate little effect of myristoylation on RNA replication or even on proteolytic processing, although processing effects have previously been observed in in vitro experiments.",

One school of thought contends that a host factor, terminal uridytyl transferase (TUTase), adds non-templated U's to the 3' ends of the would-be template RNAs. This could create a small hairpin for priming of the new strand. The negative strands of picomaviruses begin with poly (U), owing to its synthesis from the poly (A) at the 3' ends of the positive strands ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, the initial two nucleotides of all picomaviral positive strands are U's. The second school of thought draws support from a series of experiments, including the observation of free, di-uridylytated VPg (a 22 amino-acid peptide) in infected cels. This structure, VPg-pU-pU, could be used as the primer for both positive-and negative-strand synthesis (reviewed in [35] ).",

Interestingly, the recovered viral RNA contained the two U's reinstated at the 5' end of all of the progeny positive strands. With the two A's missing from the 3' end of the first negative strands, it is diftlcult to imagine how TUTase action could cream the hairpin to facilitate the priming described in the first model, discussed above. Of course, the polymerase may not require the two A-U base pairs to recognize the template-primer loop created by TUTase. In contrast, priming by VPg-pU-pU could quite easily restore these non-templated nucleotides, and this evidence can be interpreted as support for the VPg-pU-pU priming model [36\u00b0,37].",

Most strikingly, deletion mutants and defective interfering (D1) genomes of picomaviral RNAs can be replicated in the presence or absence of helper virus only if the 3' end of the defective genome remains in frame with the initiation codon at the beginning of the polyprotein. This phenomenon was first noticed during the sequencing of poliovirus D1 genomes, when numerous isolates were found to contain deletions of different sizes, all in the region of the genome encoding the viral capsids and all retaining the downstream coding regions in frame [39] . This has since been confirmed using deletion variants synthesized in vitro from engineered infectious cDNAs [40,41,42.] ; only in-frame deletions gave rise to replicatable RNA. These data can be explained most simply by either a requirement for certain poliovirus pro-teins in c/s; or a requirement for the translation of the entire poliovirus genome for its successful replication.",

Alternatively, 2B, 3A, and 3D may be proteins that act in c/s; on the genomes from which they are translated.

Models for the replication of picornaviral RNA and its dependence on the presence of an in-frame coding region. These models do not address the mechanism of priming of negativeor positive-strand synthesis, but simply the relationship of RNA synthesis to translation. For the sake of simplicity, only the initiation of negative-strand synthesis is depicted. Translation of poliovirus proteins is known to be associated with membranes [50] , which are schematically represented. (a) Nascent replication proteins are required, in cis, for the initiation of negative-or positive-strand synthesis. Only newly synthesized proteins are in the proper conformation for the initiation of RNA replication. (b) Replication proteins are sequestered in the cell near the RNA from which they were translated, along with the descendants of that RNA. Most proteins translated from other genomes have no access to the genome shown; however, any proteins able to penetrate the compartment could work in trans. (c) An RNA structure at the 3' end of the genome prevents the positive strand from acting as a template for negativestrand synthesis until the RNA structure is denatured by the translational apparatus. Thus, the act of translation itself, as well as the translation products, are required for the initiation of-negativestrand synthesis.",

Model B suggests that the apparent c/s action of certain poliovirus proteins could result from compartmentalization inside the cell. Then, the local concentration of proteins translated from a particular RNA or its siblings would be quite high relative to that of proteins translated from other, coinfecting RNAs. No replication of out-of-frame DI particle genomes would occur due to the absence of the local high concentration of proteins required for RNA replication. Again, certain functions of 2B and 3D, which operate outside the compartments involved in RNA replication, could require these proteins only at lower concentrations. In model C, an RNA structure in the positive strand is hypothesized to be inhibitory to the initiation of negative-strand synthesis. Until this structure is removed by the act of translation, no RNA replication can occur. In this model, all replication proteins can in principle act in tram, and the c/s-dominant mutations in the coding regions for 2B, 3A and 3D are in fact mutant in their RNA structures. Perhaps within the year this quandary will be resolved?",

Furthermore, unsolved quandaries such as the mechanism or mechanisms of priming RNA synthesis, and the relationship between the initiation of viral RNA synthesis and translation may yield to an assault that includes both genetic analysis and in vitro biochemistry that faithfully mimics viral replication in an infected cell. Physical alterations in complexes between transcription factor 'flq11C and DNA in poliovirus-infected cells were documented and found to correlate with the inhibition of pob~wnerase RI-mediated transcription in infected cells. The possibility that either dephosphorylation or limited proteolysis of TFIBC are responsible for transcription inhibition are discussed. This paper thus adds to the short list of cellular proteins that are altered in picornavirus-infected cells. Preparations of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were shown to perform strand.displacement synthesis by removing long stretches of annealed, complementary RNA from RNA templates during synthesis. Upon purification of the polymerase, the stranddisplacement, but not the RNA replication, activity was lost. Whether the 'accessory factor' is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein, a processivity factor for polymerase, or an RNA helicase as suggested by the authors, the ability for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to displace strands during RNA synthesis is of great interest. The RNA modification activity that converts adenosine residues to inosine in double-stranded RNA was found to be inhibited in cells infected with synthetic or natural double-stranded RNAs. Thus, the activity is probably not antiviral, as has been suggested by others.",

Proc Naa Acad Sci USA 1991, 88:3598-3602. When the extreme terminal immunoglobulin-llke domain of the poliovirus receptor, fused directly with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, was expressed on the surface of mouse cells, it was found to be sufficient to allow poliovirus infection. Furthermore, the expression of this domain attached to a truncated version of ICAM-1, another intracellular adhesion molecule that is the receptor for rhinovirus, conferred susceptibility to poliovirus. Whatever the mechanism of cell entry by picornaviruses, the membrane and cytoplasmic portions of their cellular receptors are interchangeable.",

EMBO J 1991, 10:2331-2341. A chimeric poliovirion, composed of poliovirus Mahoney type I except for the external 'BC' loop, which is derived from the mouse-adapted Lansing type 2 poliovirus, was found to differ in structure from Mahoney type 1 exclusively in the region of the loop. Thus, the ability to utilize a different cellular receptor can be conferred by external loop sequences alone. This finding argues against the hypothesis that poliovirus binds functionally to its cellular receptor only via the viral 'canyon', a recession around the fwefold axis of the virion.",

            "text": "(a) Genetic map of plcornaviruses, approximately to scale. The sizes of picornaviral genomes range from 7209-8450 nucleotides[50]. The single open reading frame is shown by the open box. The 5' and 3' non-coding regions of RNA are shown as lines and the individual viral proteins, at their terminal processing stages, are designated within the box. Proteins 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D are the viral capsid proteins VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1, respectively; 2A and 3C are viral proteases; 2B, 2C and 3A are polypeptides which, when mutant, affect viral RNA synthesis; 3B is VPg, the 22 amino-acid peptide covalently linked to the 5' end of both the positive-and the negative-RNA strands; and 3D is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Each of these proteins may play more than one role, function in the context of a larger precursor, or both. Furthermore, RNA structures within the coding regions, as well as in the 5' and 3' non-coding regions, may fulfill a function. Important differences among the picornaviruses exist. For example, the location of the poly (C) region present in cardioviruses (for example, encephalomyocarditis virus) and apthoviruses (for example, foot-and-mouth disease virus) is marked with an asterisk; the small 'leader' polypeptide present at the beginning of the single open reading frame in cardioviruses, apthoviruses and",

The transgenic mice provide both a useful model for pathogenesis and an excellent in vivo system to study the molecular requirements for productive cell entry to poliovirus. 12.
