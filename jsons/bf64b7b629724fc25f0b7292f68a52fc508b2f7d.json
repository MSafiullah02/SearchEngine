By the Yunqi theory \"pestilence occurring after 3 years\", the prevalence of infectious disease is not only related to weather factors within the current year but also associated with meteorological factors that occurred 3 years ago. Some scholars found that the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 in northern China was associated with the climate changes in 2000, which was characteristic of high temperature, less precipitation and a large area of arid climate. (7) The practical value of \"pestilence occurring after 3 years\" received increasing more attention in recent years. (8, 9) Since the meteorological variables may be the early indicators of outbreaks and epidemics, our study focuses on the association of rubella and meteorological variables of current year and particularly previous years. Based on the Yunqi theory, a forecasting model was developed using the previous data on rubella and meteorological variables.",

Secondly, the correlation between meteorological factors and rubella morbidity were analyzed by back-propagation artificial neural networks, a non-linear dynamic systems that belong to the class of feed-forward neural networks. (17) (18) (19) (20) In this study, the back-propagation artificial neural networks methods were used to assess the importance of various meteorological factors of previous years and the current year on the outbreak of rubella. The meteorological factors with impact degrees (i.e. the standardized significance by model calculations) above 50% were selected as important variables related to the incidence of rubella. Thirdly, the rubellameteorological forecast models were established and assessed. Specifi cally, a total of 8 rubella-meteorological forecast models for the prediction of the prevalence of rubella, as presented in Table 1 , were established by back-propagation artificial neural networks, and the forecasting accuracy was compared. The 8 models were divided into two groups, including Group 1 (e.g. models 1-4) analyzed rubella morbidity and meteorological factors of a single year; and Group 2 (e.g. models 5-8) analyzed rubella morbidity and combined meteorological factors of previous years. All of the samples were divided into training samples and testing samples to prevent over fitting. An ideal network model could be achieved when the test samples are less than the training samples. Consequently, the data for training and forecasting were randomly selected at the default ratio of 7:3 that was the most commonly used in the statistical analysis. The criteria of successful model assessment are according to the relative error values of training and testing, which should be less than 1, and the model will be considered to be successfully created. (21) indicated in Figure 1 , the rubella morbidity showed an obvious seasonality with the highest prevalence in the 2nd qi, accounting for 57% of the average annual incidence of rubella. Comparatively, rubella was in a state of low prevalence during the 4th, 5th, 6th and 1st qi, which accounted for 1.7%, 0.8%, 3.8% and 11.0% of the average annual incidence of rubella, respectively.

However, if considering other meteorological factors in 1-3 years ago, the prediction results of rubellameteorological forecasting models would be greatly improved. Thus, the rubella prevention and control will benefi t from considering the local previous climate changes, which consistent with the findings of other studies in infectious diseases. (22) (23) (24) The innovations of this study are summarized as follows. Firstly, based on the CM theory of Yunqi, this study divided one year into 6 equal periods (4 solar terms per period) that are called the 'six qi' or 'six phases' to describe the seasonal variations in the rubella incidence and meteorological variables. Secondly, this study focused on the effects of previous changes of weather that occurred in the past 3 years on the present incidence of rubella, which could improve the timeliness of forecasts based on established early warning models. Thirdly, back propagation artificial neural network was introduced to select the most significant weather indicator and establish the rubella-meteorological predictive models.

Moreover, the rubella-meteorological forecast model from the perspective of 3 years ago to the present was successfully established and presented a relatively high accuracy rate, which suggested the use of a combination of meteorological factors spanning from 3 years ago is superior to the use of data from a single. And there is no need to use the data of earlier periods. This information could be helpful in the early prediction of rubella outbreaks and build public health prevention and intervention strategies. Therefore, some guiding ideology on Yunqi theory regarding \"pestilence occurring after 3 years\" in CM may be beneficial to provide new ideas for the research of using climate to predict outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as rubella. Also, similar studies in other geographical areas and over longer time periods are needed to better understand the impact of weather variables on rubella.",
