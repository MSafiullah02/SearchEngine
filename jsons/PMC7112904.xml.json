The use of Q-solution, supplied in the one-step RT-PCR QIAGEN\u00a9 kit, reduced this phenomenon. Q-solution was included in multiplex RT-PCR strategies 1 and 3; preliminary studies showed that it was not necessary in multiplex RT-PCR 2. This solution reduces the number of non-specific reactions, but in some cases it can affect the hybridisation of primers and thus reduce amplification efficacy.

This may be due to the lack of sensitivity of some of the detection methods and to the fact that some respiratory viruses are not systematically sought (e.g., PIV-4, influenza C virus and HCoV). The aim of this study was to develop rapid, sensitive and specific molecular methods for the detection of a large panel of respiratory RNA viruses that are more powerful than the classical immunofluorescence assay and culture methods. During preliminary trials, we attempted to adapt the multiplex method to the detection of adenovirus, which cause frequent respiratory tract infections (Freymuth, 2001). But this affected the detection of other viruses, and we considered that it was preferable to search for adenovirus in a multiplex PCR assay including other DNA respiratory pathogens.",

All the viruses initially detected by the conventional methods were confirmed by the multiplex method, with the exception of two hRV identified after culture in MRC5 cells. It was not possible to check this result by repeating the cell culture (insufficient sample volume). The absence of inhibitors in the RT-PCR step was confirmed by the internal control. Given the large genotypic diversity of hRV, it is probable that the primers used here were not adapted to some genotypes, even though they have been shown to amplify over 60 serotypes (Savolainen et al., 2002).",

It is also very likely that the freezing and thawing steps altered the samples. The hemi-nested multiplex PCR gave a sensitivity of 100% for these two viruses. In an evaluation of the commercially available multiplex RT-PCR (Hexaplex\u00a9, Prodesse), Hindiyeh et al. found that hRSV were more difficult to detect (sensitivity of 91%) than influenza A virus (98.6%), influenza B virus (100%) and PIV1-3 (100%) (Hindiyeh et al., 2001). For the other viruses (influenza A, B and C viruses, PIV-1, -3, hRV and OC43) the first step of our method (RT-PCR) alone gave a sensitivity equivalent to that obtained with the conventional tools.

            "text": "Several multiplex methods for the simultaneous detection of several respiratory viruses have been published. Grondahl et al. described a multiplex RT-PCR-hybridisation method targeting nine microorganisms (hEV, influenza viruses A and B, hRSV, PIV-1, -3, Ad, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae). They found that its sensitivity was low, particularly for hRSV: 24 of the 140 hRSV detected by EIA were negative (Grondahl et al., 1999). Puppe et al. assessed this method in 2004 and confirmed that the sensitivity never exceeded 90% and was particularly low for PIV-3 (23%) (Puppe et al., 2004). The multiplex RT-PCR-hybridisation technique, Hexaplex was described in 1998 by Fan et al. for the detection of seven respiratory viruses: hRSV A and B, influenza viruses A and B, PIV-1, -2 and -3 (Fan et al., 1998). Four studies have found that the Hexaplex\u00a9 method had a good sensitivity (91\u2013100% depending on the study and the virus) and was more efficient than conventional methods (Fan et al., 1998, Hindiyeh et al., 2001, Kehl et al., 2001, Liolios et al., 2001). Two multiplex nested RT-PCR methods were developed by Coiras et al. for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses. The first one was able to detect six viruses (influenza viruses A, B and C, hRSV-A, -B and adenovirus) more efficiently than conventional methods, and the method detected 46 additional viruses, 34 of which were also detected by individual RT-PCRs. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods were, respectively, 100 and 87% (Coiras et al., 2003). In 2004, the authors described a second multiplex RT-PCR, which detected eight other respiratory viruses: PIV-1, -2, -3 and -4, HCoV OC43 and 229E, hRV and hEV. All samples found to be positive by immunofluorescence assay and/or cell culture (40/201) were confirmed by multiplex 2, which also detected 63 additional viruses (Coiras et al., 2004). Finally, in 2004, Templeton et al. described two real-time multiplex RT-PCR methods for the detection of seven respiratory viruses: influenza viruses A and B, hRSV, PIV-1, -2, -3 and -4 (Templeton et al., 2004), and Syrmis et al. an RT-PCR-hybridisation method for the detection of seven viruses: influenza viruses A and B, Ad, PIV-1, -2, -3 and hRSV (Syrmis et al., 2004).As well as being highly sensitive, our multiplex methods can identify a large number of viruses that are not detected by the conventional methods: 27 viruses among the 26 aspirates in the positive group and 58 viruses among the 49 aspirates in the negative group, which is equivalent to 23.4 and 53.3% of samples, respectively. According to statistical rules, the selection of test samples does not allow the calculation of the positive predictive value or of the specificity of the multiplex method. Furthermore, as believed by other authors (Vabret et al., 2000), the specificity of the method is difficult to interpret given that the reference method itself has limits. There are several possible explanations why these samples were negative according to conventional methods (a). The multiplex method can have given false positive result. Substantial precautions have been taken to prevent contaminations of reaction tubes with previously amplified products or target RNA or DNA from other specimens, and the existence of false positives due to contaminants was ruled out by the absence of unexpected bands in the negative controls (b). The immunofluorescence assay to detect antigens is associated with sensitivity problems when the viral load is low (Casiano-Colon et al., 2003), whereas molecular methods are theoretically more sensitive (c). Using the cell culture method it is difficult to detect several viruses in a given sample, as the development of one virus can mask or inhibit that of another (d). Conventional methods only detect replicative viruses, which gives them a good diagnostic value. The hypothesis that the viruses detected uniquely by the multiplex method are non-replicative is probably true in some cases (e). The most consistent argument is that cell culture methods are not adapted to all viruses, particularly to hRV, hMPV, PIV, hCoV and influenza virus C.",

            "text": "In this study, hRV that were detected uniquely by the multiplex method (26 in the negative group and 15 in the positive group) are likely to be serotypes that are difficult or impossible to culture. However, only MRC5 and HuH7 cells were used for viral isolation technique, and the traditional cell lines, such as MDCK, HeLa R or NCI-H292 cells, were not used. This could explain the greater quantity of viruses that were found using the multiplex RT-PCR assay in relation to the cell cultures. The detection of hRV is considerably improved by the use of molecular biology techniques (Savolainen et al., 2003, Coiras et al., 2004, Gilbert et al., 1996). A retrospective study carried out in Caen between 1998 and 2000 revealed 211 hRV infections in hospitalised children, 53% of which were identified by cell culture and 47% of which were identified only by RT-PCR (Guittet et al., 2003). Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the detection of hRV in nasal aspirates may be associated with interpretation problems, given that this virus can persist for 2 weeks or longer after the acute phase (Jartti et al., 2004). The multiplex RT-PCR1 was able to detect all the hMPV previously identified. Furthermore, a high proportion of hMPV was found in the negative group: 14/92, i.e., 15% of samples and nine others in the positive group. hMPV is responsible for 5\u20137% of viral respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children worldwide (Van Den Hoogen et al., 2004, Boivin et al., 2003, Freymuth et al., 2003a, Freymuth et al., 2003b). Until now hMPV was not targeted by any multiplex protocol. Its clinical impact and its prevalence fully justify its detection in routine diagnosis, alongside hRSV. Three type 4 PIV were detected by this method: one in the positive group and two in the negative group. It is very difficult to culture this serotype in vitro and immunofluorescence assay has only been possible for a short while, since the production of a first monoclonal anti-PIV-4 antibody. For these reasons PIV-4 is practically never sought in virology laboratories (Echevarria et al., 1998). But it has been shown that it can cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia in young children and immunodepressed subjects and its prevalence appears to be higher than originally thought (Aguilar et al., 2000, Lindquist et al., 1997). Three HCoV OC43 were detected by the multiplex PCR, two of which were positive with the cell culture method. The HCoV OC43, which are generally considered to cause colds, have been described to cause lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) in infants and the elderly (Vabret et al., 2003). Given that few virology laboratories seek HCoV, it is probable that their pathogenic role is underestimated (Vabret et al., 1998). The influenza C virus is generally considered to cause non-severe influenza. However, its pathogenic potential is not well known and its frequency is undoubtedly highly underestimated, as shown by the presence of anti-influenza C antibodies in a large proportion of the French population (Manuguerra et al., 1992).",

This internal control was used in multiplex 2 only, as it caused disturbances in amplifications results of the other RT-PCR multiplex assays and in the hemi-nested PCR multiplex 2. Theoretically, since those RT-PCR multiplex assays used the same amplification kit and the same extraction protocol, the amplification of GAPDH would be similar in the three RT-PCR assays. A GAPDH amplification product was observed for all nasal aspirates tested, indicating that no enzyme inhibitors were present. However, it has never been validated for use as an internal control in respiratory samples. The techniques described by Coiras et al. include an internal control supplied with the Promega\u00a9 kit; once again no amplification inhibitors were detected during clinical evaluations (Coiras et al., 2003, Coiras et al., 2004). Syrmis et al. used an endogenous human retrovirus (ERV-3) as an internal control and found that only 5 out of 396 samples tested were amplification negative (Syrmis et al., 2004). Dingle et al. created a stable internal control based on a modified RNA fragment of hepatitis Delta (Dingle et al., 2004). Among the 324 respiratory samples tested, only two cases of inhibition were detected. It is possible that the dilution of samples in the transport medium overcomes the effect of inhibitors (Syrmis et al., 2004).",

The RT-PCR 1 and 2 described by Coiras et al., respectively, detected 4.5 and 21% of co-infections among the positive samples (Coiras et al., 2003, Coiras et al., 2004). The method described by Templeton et al. detected 2.3% of co-infections (Templeton et al., 2004). Of the four studies that have evaluated the Hexaplex technique, only that by Kehl et al. (2001) reported cases of co-infection: 10% among the positive samples, none of which were confirmed by cell culture. The studies by Osiowy (1998), Puppe et al. (2004) and Syrmis et al. (2004) did not describe any cases of co-infection. In our 77% of co-infections in the positive group and 100% of co-infections in the negative group involved hRV. The rate of viral co-infection among hRV infections appears to be very variable: from 5 to 40% (Guittet et al., 2003). Three cases of triple infection were observed: one in the positive group and two in the negative group (cf. Table 4, Table 5). Two cases associating hRSV, VIP3 and hRV were previously described by Gilbert et al. (1996) who used a protocol involving three distinct RT-PCRs, specific for each virus.",

(2000) studied samples from 202 newborns hospitalised for bronchiolitis and detected viral co-infection in 27% of them, with a predominance of hRSV (39%). The analysis of various clinical and radiological parameters in these children showed that viral co-infections are not associated with more severe forms (Brouard et al., 2000). Other authors found no difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the intensity of clinical signs between co-infected children and those infected with only one virus (Maletzky et al., 1971, Portnoy et al., 1965). In children, co-infections associating hRSV and influenza A virus, hRV or PIV are not associated with more severe signs than mono-infections, whereas hRSV-Adenovirus co-infections may be associated with a worse prognosis (Glezen et al., 1980, Meissner et al., 1984, Tristram et al., 1988, Valenti et al., 1982). To date, the study of viral co-infections has not revealed any particular clinical impact, however most of the methods used have undoubtedly underestimated the proportion of co-infections, either due to lack of sensitivity (i.e., conventional methods) or because the panel of viruses sought was too restricted. It is probable that the use of a multiplex RT-PCR approach will give results that are closer to reality and provide interesting information on the existence of associated or successive infections, their role and their clinical, prognostic and epidemiological effects.",
