Th2 cytokine responses are predominant in infants with RSV infection [9], and contribute to the pathogenesis of severe RSV disease, such as increased interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 [3]. Some studies have indicated that Th1 cytokine responses such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 decrease with severe RSV disease in infants [10], [11]. All these data suggest that a balanced Th1/Th2 response is critical to mitigating RSV-mediated disease severity in pediatric patients.",

            "text": "The presence of precise combinations of cytokines can effectively regulate the development of polarized Th cell responses mounted in response to viral infections. It has been shown that IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b2 were defined as regulatory cytokine due to the immunosuppressive roles in viral infections and autoimmunity disease [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. For example, IL-10 inhibits acute inflammation and mitigates progression of an imbalanced Th1/Th2 response triggered by RSV infection [8], [18], [19]. IL-35 has recently been identified as a suppressive cytokine that contributes to the induction of type 1 regulatory T cells and modulates IL-10 production [12], [20]. TGF-\u03b2 is another immunosuppressive cytokine that interferes with the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 in response to RSV infection [21]. All these data indicated that protective immune responses are regulated by regulatory cytokines and depend on the infectious agent. Conversely, other researches have demonstrated the IL-10 also induced strong Th2-dominant immune response and enhanced the RSV disease [19]. To evaluate the role of regulatory cytokines in RSV disease, we characterized changes in the expression levels of several regulatory cytokines including IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b21 in the context of RSV infection in pediatric patients, and characterized the role in response to RSV infection.",

Some studies have demonstrated that IL-10 produced by effector T cells and monocytes played a pivotal role in controlling disease severity by suppressing the production of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) [18], [32]. In addition, IL-10 also can suppress Th2 cell generation and further suppress airway hyper-responsiveness and tissue remodeling in RSV-infected patients [19]. But IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 also were excess produced by type 2 T cells, which can enhance the RSV disease [7], [33]. In this study, we found the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease and inversely associated with total duration of symptoms. These data indicate that IL-10 was plays a protective role. Lower level of IL-10 was associated with more-severe RSV disease. IL-10 producing by CD4+FoxP3+ and CD4+FoxP3- T cell were plays a critical role in regulating the immune response in RSV infection by restricting T-cell-mediated pulmonary inflammation and injury [34]. IL-35 has been shown to have potential suppressive activities through the expansion of Treg cells and IL-10 production to inhibit the CD4+ effector cells inducing Th1 and Th17 cells [27]. Although our results demonstrated increased expression of IL-35 in RSV-infected pediatric patients, expression levels did not correlate with the severity of disease. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the enhanced levels of IL-35 by affecting the IL-10 expression and indirectly contribute to amelioration of disease in RSV-infected patients. Novel mechanisms indicated that B lymphocytes exert a suppressive function in viral infection in an IL-10-independent manner through production of IL-35 [35]. IL-10, IL-35 and from inducible T regulatory cells exhibits the potential suppressive function and plays a critical role maintaining immune balance [20]. Future studies will be required to evaluate the correlation between IL-10 and IL-35 in RSV disease.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that older age is inversely associated with susceptibility to RSV infection, in addition to decreasing the risk of hospitalization and disease severity [5], [36]. It is interestingly that the children less than 6months had significantly lower IL-10 and IL-35 compared to children 12< age <24 months old, but a correlation between age and the regulatory cytokines was not observed. As we known, the infant less than 6months has an immature immune system, including innate immune response and adaptive response, but due to the residual maternal antibody that may prevent induction of a good immune response [1], [37]. Other study had revealed that the cytokines/chemokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 were not significantly different between the age group in children with RSV infection [38]. The results of the present study have shown that the levels of IL-10 and IL-35 were significant lower in children 0< age \u22646 months who were more likely to need supplemental oxygen. These data indicated that IL-10 and IL-35 expression is RSV specific, and play a protective role in RSV disease. In accordance with other investigators, the study has shown that IL-10 was increased in response to RSV infection, and lower concentration of IL-10 was associated with more severe RSV disease [16], [38]. We had not found any study about IL-35 in RSV disease. Others have demonstrated that IL-10 inhibits viral replication [16], but we had not found any relationships between IL-10 and RSV load. Disease presentation has for a long time been used as an indicator of the severity of disease resulting from RSV infection. Our results suggested that children 0< age \u22646 months were significantly more likely to present with a longer total duration of symptoms. This observation was in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that younger children are at a greater risk of infection and more likely to develop severe disease symptoms following infection with RSV [39], [40]. Serum IL-10 level was inversely associated with total duration of symptoms. It also indicated that high IL-10 level was associated with a favorable outcome and contributed to the recovery and attenuation of disease progression in RSV-infected children.",
