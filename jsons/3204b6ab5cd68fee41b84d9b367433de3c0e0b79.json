Leveraging individual-level location data for 10 million smartphones, we observe that by April 30th-when nine in ten Americans were under a SHO-daily movement had fallen 70% from pre-COVID levels. Onequarter of this decline is causally attributable to SHOs, with wide demographic differences in compliance, most notably by political affiliation. Likely Trump voters reduce movement by 9% following a local SHO, compared to a 21% reduction among their Clinton-voting neighbors, who face similar exposure risks and identical government orders. Linking social distancing behavior with an epidemic model, we estimate that reductions in movement have causally reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates by 49%.",

Expert recommendations emphasize the need for first increasing test availability while strengthening essential worker training, before incrementally relaxing social distancing policies (3) . As restrictions are lifted, identifying which policies most effectively reduce virus transmission can help lower the risk of a second wave of infections, and mitigate its spread should one arise (4) .",

Measures of SHO effectiveness in the United States vary substantially, ranging from an 8% reduction in mobility (8) to a 19% decrease in visits outside the home (9) , with other studies estimating 35-45% fewer cases two weeks after a SHO is implemented (10, 11) . In harder hit regions including Seattle (12) , San Francisco and Los Angeles (13) , and New York City (14) , SHOs are thought to cut transmission rates by 50% or more.

Republican governors issue distancing policies 1.7 days later, on average, than their Democrat counterparts, a delay that reaches 2.7 days in states with a large Trump electorate, even after controlling for local case counts (18) . Google searches for COVID-related terms are lower in Trump-majority counties, although this difference attenuates following reports of self-quarantining by prominent Republicans (19) .

We utilize smartphone device-level data to compute the total distance traveled outside the home each day, totaling more than 400 million person-day observations. By April 30th, average movement had declined 70% from pre-pandemic levels, with SHOs causally accounting for onefourth of the decline, a 16% decrease (1-e -0.170 = 0.16, p<0.0001), as many residents severely curtailed movement outside the home before obtaining a formal SHO (Fig. 1 ). Nearly 75% of statewide SHOs occurred within two weeks of mandatory school, restaurant, and non-essential business closures (1, 24) . The combined effect of these closures along with gathering restrictions and SHOs was a 31% reduction in travel (p<0.0001, Table S1 , column 1), implying that less than half the reduction in movement is directly attributable to SHOs, closures and gathering restrictions.",

For instance, an increase in neighboring counties' COVID cases could lead to both more local cases and prompt aggressive county-level distancing policies. By explicitly restricting our estimates to those attributable to changes in individual movement-the causal path between distancing policies and disease transmission-our approach mitigates this potential for bias. What could still bias our estimates would be a strong county-time confound that effects both movement and new cases in that county at that time, but is not reflected in that county's distancing policies. Even in the presence of such a confound though, our estimate would likely still be closer to the true effect that what a na\u00efve regression would measure. . \u2032 \u2032 Regression 1 below estimates the effect of distancing policies on movement without conditioning on COVID cases. Regression 2 then estimates the effect of movement on local transmission (i.e., within an infected individual's county) controlling for any social distancing policies. Combining those estimates to arrive at the effectiveness of distancing policies at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission is equivalent to a \"front-door\" causal estimator as first developed by Pearl (26), and first used by Glynn and Kashin (29).",
