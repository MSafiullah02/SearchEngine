It is used to treat conditions that result in bone marrow failure (such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes), immunodeficiencies (such as severe combined immunodeficiency or chronic granulomatous disease), or congenital disorders that result in enzyme deficiencies in cells derived from hematopoietic precursors that result in metabolic disorders (such as mucopolysaccharidoses or glycogen storage diseases). These disorders are relatively rare in the general population. More commonly, HCT is used as a cancer therapy, primarily for hematologic malignancies (such as lymphomas, leukemias, and multiple myeloma). In this latter type of application, HCT is used to facilitate administration of intensive chemoradiotherapy. The intensive conditioning regimen suppresses and sometimes ablates the normal hematopoietic precursors. The graft is given to rescue the hematopoietic injury. In the case of allogeneic HCT, the graft also provides adoptive immunotherapy targeting cancer cells that express novel antigens.",

The occurrence of GVHD may necessitate a more prolonged course of immunotherapy and slow immune recovery.

Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), Aspergillus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can occur during this period. The risk for serious infection is greater after allogeneic HCT since GVHD or the use of high dose corticosteroids can intensify T cell immunodeficiency [1\u20134]. The use of anti-thymocyte globulin (or alemtuzumab) to prevent or treat GVHD or promote engraftment can have enduring effects on T cells (and NK cells in the case of alemtuzumab) and may render the patient vulnerable for a longer period of time. T cell depletion of the graft and HLA disparity between the donor and recipient delay T cell recovery. With nonablative transplants, the immunosuppressive regimen is frequently tapered more quickly (to provoke a graft-versus-tumor effect); this may increase the risk for GVHD. Various single center reports have suggested either an increase or decrease in infectious risk with nonablative transplants; as yet, the difference in conditioning regimens, case mix, and immunosuppressive regimens prevent a clear understanding of whether the risk of infection or timing of infection and epidemiology of infection is truly similar or different. Further study is needed.",

Patients who develop chronic GVHD require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and are susceptible to fungal and viral infections due to T cell immunodeficiency. The need for prednisone at daily doses of 1 mg/kg/day for extended periods of time has been associated with a particularly high risk for aspergillosis. The use of infliximab renders the patient at even higher risk for aspergillosis.

Cord blood transplants often have longer durations of neutropenia that may extend up to 28\u201335 days. Neutropenic fever is common in the pre-engraftment period but is less problematic in nonablative transplants. Fever may be generally the only manifestation of infection and, operationally, infection should be approached as the likely cause since serious morbidity may ensue if untreated. Evaluation should include elicitation of symptoms suggestive of an infectious site and examination to look for an infectious site (especially skin, oral mucosa, lungs, catheter site, abdomen, and perianal area). Blood cultures should be obtained and cultures of any site suspected to be infected. A chest radiograph is generally done, but if the lungs are highly suspected from history or examination, then a CT scan is preferred since it would be more likely to yield useful information [6]. Persistent or recrudescent fever may be due to antibiotic-resistant Gram negative bacteria, Gram positive bacteria (especially S. epidermidis, less commonly an alpha streptococcus, or S. aureus), or fungus (especially Candida or Aspergillus). Evaluation and more specific diagnostic considerations for infections in the neutropenic host are addressed in Chap. 5 and have been delineated in consensus guidelines [7, 8].",

In a large series of IA, macronodules with or without halos were present in 94% of cases of IA and 79% had multiple nodules [17]. Halo signs were present in 61%. In another small series, more than ten nodules or a pleural effusion tended to more likely in Zygomycosis compared to IA [18].",

Elicitation of lower tract symptoms and evidence of consolidation on physical exam should alert the clinician to the possibility of pneumonia. However, even in the absence of any of these, fever of uncertain etiology may warrant investigation of pneumonia as the source of fever. Hemoptysis may occur with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage early after transplant. Hemoptysis, pleuritic pain, and the presence of pleural rub may suggest Aspergillosis. Upper respiratory tract symptoms suggest a respiratory viral infection. Lack of sputum is typical of respiratory virus, CMV, and PCP pneumonias. However, these manifestations are too insensitive and not sufficiently specific to indicate firmly the etiology. CT scans to determine the character of infiltrate is more useful. Prior to the onset of pneumonia symptoms, a number of tests may identify those at risk for or with incipient lower respiratory tract infection. Nasal viral cultures, shell vial centrifugation cultures using RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies, or rapid diagnostics using DFA or ELISA assays are important for diagnostic assessment of the respiratory viruses, and may be useful in the assessment of patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. CMV antigen assays or PCR assays of blood samples should be performed and often are positive 1\u20132 weeks in advance of CMV pneumonia.

In the case of a suspected mold infection, even with an extensive negative evaluation, continued therapy may be justified if the clinical suspicion remains high. If the etiology is not clear and the patient does not improve clinically and radiographically, further investigation should be undertaken. Typically, infiltrates may get worse early even in the face of clinical improvement and even though pneumonia ultimately responds.

The benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis after HCT have been debated and no firm recommendation was given in the HCT consensus guidelines in 2000 [5]. However, they are widely used in the pre-engraftment phase, and more recent studies suggest such benefits as reductions in febrile episodes, bacterial infec\u00adtions, and death (from any cause) in patients with neutropenia. Such benefits have been seen in patients with acute leukemia and HCT [61\u201363]. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are the most suitable agents. Drawbacks include cost, toxicities, and the risk of antibiotic resistance. If antibiotic prophylaxis is elected, surveillance of isolates for resistance is important since various centers have reported the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance [64]. Although most infections that are prevented are from gram-negative bacteria, there seems to also be some protection against alpha streptococcal and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infections as well [61]. Another concern is an increased susceptibility for C. difficile infection. Accordingly, centers that choose to use fluoroquinolone prophylaxis must monitor both resistance as well as C. difficile infection rates. The issues concerning antibiotic prophylaxis are discussed in greater detail in Chap. 10.",

Itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole have been shown to offer protection against IA during neutropenia in nontransplant oncology settings [74\u201377]. Two studies of itraconazole prophylaxis in the allogeneic HCT setting suggest a potential for benefit to prevent IA [78, 79], but limitations include poor tolerability and concerns about toxicity. Posaconazole has been evaluated in HCT patients with acute and chronic GVHD and compared to fluconazole [80]. This \u201ctargeted\u201d approach seems sensible since GVHD and its therapy are the major risk factors for IA. Although there was a decrease in breakthrough IA, there was no impro\u00advement in clinical success (defined as survival without IFI or use of systemic antifungal therapy). Voriconazole prophylaxis has also been studied in standard-risk allogeneic BMT patients in a randomized double-blind multicenter trial and is not found to be superior to fluconazole in terms of survival at 6 months free of invasive fungal infection although there were fewer IA infections and voriconazole was not associated with greater toxicity [81]. One potential concern with voriconazole is its lack of activity against Zygomycetes; its routine use has been associated with an apparent increase in zygomycosis in several single center studies [18, 82\u201384]. However, there were no increases in IA rates in the prospective randomized prophylaxis trial [81].",

Although acyclovir and its prodrug, valacyclovir, are well tolerated the relatively poor in vitro activity against CMV has led most clinicians to rely on ganciclovir which has much greater intrinsic anti-CMV activity. Unfortunately, ganciclovir is associated with myelosuppression. This toxicity has led to evaluation of serial monitoring of HCT patients with weekly testing of blood by the pp65 antigen or PCR assay, and institution of pre-emptive antiCMV therapy with ganciclovir (or foscarnet) in patients who become viremic [87, 90]. In general, there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Prophylaxis is generally associated with fewer episodes of breakthrough CMV pneumonia, but more toxicity. Pre-emptive therapy is associated with more episodes of late-onset CMV pneumonia. Oral valganciclovir has good bioavailability and has been used in limited studies to replace intravenous ganciclovir. Although the toxicities are the same, there are obvious advantages in convenience and cost.",

Although acyclovir (or valacyclovir) treatment is effective, some patients can present with a life-threatening visceral infection (involving serosal intestinal wall, liver, or pancreas) without cutaneous lesions with a high fatality rate. This condition should be suspected in any HCT patient presenting with excruciating abdominal pain, even with a benign abdominal exam. Moreover, sequelae of VZV can pose significant compromises in quality of life in HCT survivors. Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in prevention. Acyclovir prophylaxis given for 6 months was associated with fewer VZV infections while the patient was receiving acyclovir, but relapses occurred shortly after cessation of drug abrogating the benefit. However, more recently, prophylaxis for 1 year has been shown to offer durable protection [91] and preservation of viral T cell helper responses but without rebound relapses after stopping prophylaxis.",
