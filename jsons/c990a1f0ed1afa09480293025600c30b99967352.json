For well over a decade, Twitter has become increasingly used as a platform where medical practitioners exchange ideas, information, and commentary. The hashtag #FOAMed garners thousands of tweets per hour, and at this momentous period in medical history, no subject is more prominent than COVID-19. With the free-flow of messages and ideas that are not vetted or peer-reviewed, unlike classic medical educational resources, is there a risk of harm? What are the benefits to the EM community from Twitter? Finally, how does the average emergency physician (EP) get the most out of the information out there?",

Although tongue in cheek for some, there is a hashtag #apocalypse2020 for all those who are preparing for the end. This is risky for many reasons and, very importantly, the mental well-being of Twitter users. Social media have been associated with increased mental distress, self-harm, and suicide. 2 Additionally, the spread of information is not limited by distance, such that the pandemic of fear can and has spread before the actual C-19 pandemic. 3 This has an effect on our patients' mental health, putting their physical and mental well-being at risk. This can lead to an increase in suicidal ideation or attempts and is something that the EP has to prepare for at increasing rates during this pandemic. Let's not forget the similar risk to frontline medical providers, being exposed to the same stresses and endangering our mental well-being.",

Trump's tweet touting the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as one of the \"biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" 6 This, of course, turned out to be a falsehood with multiple respected medical bodies asking for physicians to keep from prescribing the combination. 7 Whether well-intentioned or malicious in nature, the spread of misinformation leads to fear, inappropriate prescribing, less response to warnings on issues such as social-distancing, and mistrust in the medical advice due to the plethora of misinformation.",

The benefit of social media is that the content is often more novel. In the middle of a pandemic, the ability to rapidly share information is critical for knowledge translation and dissemination, and Twitter is able to do this in a way that is typically not feasible for textbooks or journals. Most relevant to the EM community, we are seeing the free exchange of protocols/guidelines from specialty groups such as the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, highly reputable international journals (such as Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal of Medicine, BMJ [formerly British Medical Journal], and others), and academic/community hospitals. Leading on this front are many of the established medical educators who use Twitter as part of the Free Online Access Medical Education (FOAMed) effort to educate EPs on the global pandemic. Just one of these examples is the \"Protected Airway Process\" from Dr. Christopher Hicks, widely shared and retweeted by frontline practitioners to ensure that health care providers remain safe during intubations. 11 It's amazing to think that medical professionals everywhere around the globe have the same database of information with the simple use of a website or mobile application. Although the user must remain vigilant in the face of any new information presented to them, these respected institutions and users can equip health care workers worldwide with the knowledge to combat the pandemic.",
