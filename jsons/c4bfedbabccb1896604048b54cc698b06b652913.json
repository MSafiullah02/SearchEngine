Results have been compared with those obtained by complement fixation (CF), neutralization (Nt), and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests. The IAHA method has been shown to be as sensitive as the CF, Nt, and IHA tests in detecting cases of acute 229E infection. However, in a seroepidemiological survey of 343 healthy people of all ages, IAIIA detected 229E antibody in 254 individuals (74.0%), Nt in 166 (48.3%), IHA in 89 (25.Y%), and CF in 30 (8.7%). A study of the prevalence of coronavirus 229E IAHA antibody in the different age groups has shown that during the second decade of life nearly 100% of the population acquire this type of antibody, whereas only 50% are positive at the end of the first decade. In the older age groups, the high frequency of C F antibody (\"marker\" of recent infection) indirectly confirms the high rate of 229E reinfections and the nonprotective nature of IAHA antibody. C F titer 2 1 :8 in 90% of cases corresponded to IAIIA titers 2 1 :64. However, sera with IAHA titers of 2 1 : 128 were often CF-negative. Recent 2298 infections (or reinfections), as determined by the presence of CF antibody, were more frequent in April-May than in October-November.

Technical problems such as nonspecific hemagglutination may sometimes arise with contamined sera or with frozen sera stored for a long time. However, it is usually easy to distinguish between the fine granular hemagglutination pattern due to the specific antigen-antibody reaction and the fuzzy pattern due to a nonspecific reaction. So far, extensive epidemiological surveys have been carried out using CF, IHA, or Nt tests. When only the CF test was employed, relatively low levels of seropositivity were found in population samples of different countries [ 3 , 51 . Levels of 229E seropositivity reached higher values [4] only when very potent antigens were prepared using special concentration procedures. IHA and Nt test have been reported to be in good agreement in more than 90% of sera tested for determination of 229E antibody [7] . Our results apparently show the Nt test to be more sensitive than IHA. The reason for this discrepancy may be the low initial dilution (1 : 5 ) and the more accurate test performance in microplates than with tubes. However, our results show that the IAHA test is far more sensitive than both IHA and Nt tests in detecting long-lasting 229E antibody. ferent age groups it appears that coronavirus 229E infections start occurring in the first five years of life, and more than 90% of adults show the presence of antibody to coronavirus 229E in their serum. In parallel, 229E CF antibody (a \"marker\" of recent infection) does not present remarkable variation in the frequency of its distribution after the second decade of life. These data indirectly confirm the high rate of coronavirus 229E reinfections reported previously [ 171. In regard to this point in particular, neither IHA nor neutralizing antibody has been shown to be protective, and reinfections have been described in carriers of both types of antibody [ 171 . On the basis of our results, we conclude that even IAHA antibody is not protective.

Furthermore CF titers of 1 :4 Looking at the prevalence of 229E antibody detected by the IAHA test in the dif-were often difficult to read because of incomplete complement fixation. So far, both epidemiological and technical data suggest that the performance of the CF test starting from a 1 :4 dilution could be misleading in the diagnosis of a recent 229E infection. However, CF titers of 1:4 were always in agreement with IAHA titers, testifying to the specificity of the reaction. In our opinion, CF titers of 1 :4 may be longer lasting than higher titers. This interpretation seems to agree with the results of Bradburne and Somerset [4] , showing a very high prevalence of CF antibody when very potent antigens were employed in the CF tests. employed in this study can be used for diagnosis of a recent infection or reinfection.
