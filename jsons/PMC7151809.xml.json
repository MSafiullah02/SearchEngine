A large CDC-initiated study found that among children with acute respiratory infection admitted to hospital or attending outpatient services, 18% of specimens were positive for RSV.33 Extrapolating this figure to the entire US population, 2 million children under 5 years of age would require medical attention due to RSV infection on a yearly basis.33 In older children and immunocompetent adults, RSV infections are seldom severe and are usually manifested as upper respiratory infection (URI) or tracheobronchitis. Individuals at high risk for severe RSV infection include premature infants (particularly those born at less than 34 weeks of gestation), young infants with chronic lung disease or a hemodynamically significant congenital heart defect, elderly individuals and immunocompromised subjects. Recent studies indicate that the disease burden caused by RSV in elderly and high-risk adults had previously been underestimated and is currently thought to be similar to that of endemic influenza A.34 Development of an effective RSV vaccine is therefore required for both young children and the elderly.",

In a large multicenter placebo-controlled trial involving high-risk infants, palivizumab prophylaxis resulted in a 55% reduction in hospitalization rates and number of hospital days ascribed to RSV infection.40 Both agents have been well tolerated, with few adverse effects; however, their high cost necessitates strict guidelines for their use.

In children with a hemodynamically significant congenital heart defect only palivizumab is indicated for prophylaxis.41 Cost-saving benefit has not been observed uniformly,42., 43., 44., 45., 46. perhaps as a result of major differences in the prevalence of RSV lower respiratory tract infections in different countries and regions, suggesting the need for locally adapted recommendations.

Direct immunofluorescence assays with commercially produced virus-specific antibodies are available, although they are probably less sensitive than RT-PCR for the detection of virus. Molecular methods have become the method of choice for the detection of the HMPV genome. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the N and/or L gene has been found to be sensitive, specific and rapid in detecting the virus in clinical specimens.78 Serologic diagnosis can be achieved by ELISA methods demonstrating a fourfold increase in antibody titers or seroconversion.",
