Incidence of new cases and corresponding mortalities have been escalating daily.",

First, coronaviruses originated in animals before transferring to humans. El-Kafrawy and colleagues found that MERS-CoV was present in 22\u00b78% of the camels sampled, indicating a high prevalence and even an occupational hazard for people who work with them. For example, camel shepherds are more likely to be infected. The authors further found that MERS-CoV presence was higher among local camels in Saudi Arabia than imported camels from African trade ports.1 For 2019-nCoV, bats are the likely origin, based on sequencing evidence of samples in early patients who developed pneumonia, where researchers found an 85% identity with a previously published genome of bat SARS-like coronovirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1). The clade of 2019-nCoV is within the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.2 How 2019-nCoV arrived in Wuhan is currently undetermined, but recent evidence shows 27 (66%) of 41 initial infected patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market.3 Public health officials should investigate whether other coronaviruses exist where 2019-nCoV is likely to have originated so as to prevent future epidemics, especially if infection is an occupational hazard.",

Compared with containment of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, China now has a far greater transportation capacity. The basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV is evolving quickly, with estimates in mid-January of each case infecting 2\u00b76 other people (uncertainty range 1\u00b75\u20133\u00b75).5\n",
