The virus was discovered in humans in 2012, and since then there has been over 2,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide, with 35% of infected humans suffering fatal outcomes [7\u20139]. Although MERS-CoV zoonotic and human-to-human transmission rates have declined due to general awareness and improved hospital practices, there are continued possibilities for epidemics, and there is a need for preventive vaccines and therapeutic antivirals. Mechanistic insights into human MERS-CoV entry will promote vaccine and antiviral drug developments.",

Infection is initiated through viral S protein binding to host cell receptors. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage of cell-bound S proteins triggers S protein-mediated coalescence (fusion) of viral and cell membranes. The triggering process involves a series of currently obscure S protein conformational changes, from \u201c pre-fusion\u201d metastable states to \u201c extended fusion intermediates\u201d to \u201c post-fusion\u201d collapsed states that exist after virus and cell membranes have coalesced and viral mRNA genomes have dispensed into the host cell cytoplasm [10, 11]. These events depend on cellular proteases, and as one may expect, the availability of particular proteases immediately following receptor engagement is a rate-limiting step in CoV entry.",

For several CoV infections, not all of these proteases are required; however, it is possible that each has distinct potential to activate fusion such that a productive infection ensues. There is evidence that particular CoVs have \u201cpreferred\u201d in vivo entry routes (e.g., MERS-CoV and 229E-CoV prefer plasma membrane entry, while some MHV-CoVs prefer endosome entry [14\u201319], (see Fig. 1). Knowledge of these preferred routes, and their relation to virus-induced disease, is necessary to identify virus variants that might have high transmissibility and disease potential, and to recognize the host factors that might be targeted therapeutically such that infections are suppressed at the cell entry stage.",

CoV spike proteins facilitate membrane fusion by transiting from \u201c extended fusion intermediates\u201d to \u201c post-fusion\u201d conformations. This transition requires interactions between antiparallel helices termed heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) [20, 21], and can be arrested by exogenous HR2 peptides, which bind to the fusion intermediates. Typically, HR2 peptides do not enter endosomes and therefore only arrest viruses that transition into intermediate conformations extracellularly, i.e., at target cell plasma membranes. However, lipid-conjugated HR2 peptides can bind plasma membranes and endocytose, accumulating in endosomes such that they will arrest intracellular virus-cell membrane fusion. Using a modified Subheading 3.4.2, we tested the efficacy of native vs. lipid-conjugated HR2 on blocking CoV endosomal entry [22].Plate sufficient permissive cells into a 96-well plate, 60 \u03bcl per well, to reach 95% confluency on the next day.On the following day, at \u22121 h, remove media and add 60 \u03bcl of native vs. lipid-conjugated HR2 peptides at 0.01\u20131 \u03bcM, or vehicle control. Incubate cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.Add 40 \u03bcl of MERS spike-bearing viral particles (Subheadings 3.1 or 3.2) onto cells. Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow viral entry.After 1 h, remove unbound particles by aspirating the supernatant. Rinse twice with 100 \u03bcl PBS. Add back 50 \u03bcl of fresh media. Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C overnight (~18 h post viral inoculation).Remove media, add 50 \u03bcl of 1x CCLR to lyse cells. Freeze the plate at \u221280 \u00b0C for 30 min. Thaw the plate and transfer 20 \u03bcl to a white reading plate to analyze firefly luciferase activity. Normalize enzyme activity from all conditions to the vehicle control, which is set to \u201c100%.\u201d Plot data as \u201c% viral entry.\u201d",

These include but are not limited to: (1) transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (hTMPRSS2), which facilitates MERS-CoV entry at the plasma membrane. (2) tetraspanin hCD9, which ferries the MERS-CoV receptor hDPP4 into close proximity with hTMPRSS2 to potentiate MERS-CoV entry at the plasma membrane. (3) interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (hIFITM3), which blocks CoV endosomal entry.Plate sufficient permissive cells into a 6-well plate, 2 ml per well, to reach 85% confluency on the next day.On the following day, transfect cells with expression plasmids for vector control, hTMPRSS2, hCD9, or hIFITM3 (see\nNote 14):Make transfection mixture by adding 1 \u03bcg of plasmid and 12 \u03bcl of PEI into 200 \u03bcl of OptiMEM.

However, for consistency and reproducibility we do not recommend producing particles in container sizes smaller than 5-cm diameter.When using PEI as a transfection reagent, use 1 \u03bcg of DNA per million cells.293T cells can detach from the plate, so exert care when replacing media. Always add back media after aspiration as soon as possible to prevent cell-drying. When adding media, liquid should land on the side wall of the plate, not directly onto the cells. Always pre-warm media.The DNA:PEI ratio (1:~6) is optimized specifically for a transfection period of 6\u20138 h. If transfection is allowed to go overnight, lower the DNA:PEI ratio to 1:3.JUNV GP-vsv\u0394G pseudovirus was chosen for its short half-life, which reduces the amount of inoculum JUNV GP pseudovirus contaminating the desired CoV-spike- vsv\u0394G.This protocol maximizes pseudovirus production by taking three consecutive harvests from the producer cells (24\u201348, 48\u201372, and 72\u201396 h post-transfection). Each harvest period brings similar pseudovirus yields.At the indicated spin speed, the k-factor is 4556. Since the sedimentation coefficients of VSV [25] or HIV [26] pseudovirus are around 500, a 9-h spin is sufficient. The actual spin time is doubled to insure that the pseudoviruses are pelleted through the more viscous 20% sucrose cushion.When resuspending pellet, set 1 ml pipette to 200 \u03bcl and pipette up and down gently to avoid bubbles. Make sure to rinse the entire bottom of the tube to maximize collection.The current protocol describes viral entry into cells seeded in 96-well plates. This protocol can be scaled up as long as the ratio of all components remains constant.After removing media via aspiration, return fresh media to cells as soon as possible to prevent cell drying. Aspirate and return media from a maximum of 24 wells at a time.CoV entry kinetics are unique to each virus and host cell combination. In LET-1 cells, MERS-CoV entry completes in around 1 h. In HeLa cells, 229E-CoV entry takes 4+ hours to complete. Pilot experiments with larger time intervals (30\u201360 min) are recommended.The vehicle control for protease inhibitors is DMSO, which is cytotoxic at high concentrations. Pilot experiments are recommended to identify nontoxic DMSO concentrations.Samples can be kept at \u221280 \u00b0C for up to a month before reading Fluc. To further prevent signal loss, protease inhibitor cocktail can be added to 1x CCLR before use.For cell types that are killed by PEI:DNA transfection, lipid-based transfection vectors such as lipofectamine can be used instead. For cell types that are resistant to transfection, retro- or lenti-viral-based or adenovirus-based transduction systems can be used to introduce genes of interest [15].\n",
