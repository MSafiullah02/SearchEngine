SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 efficiently replicates in the upper respiratory tract and can proceed into the lower respiratory tract where it exacerbates pre\u2010existing lung conditions. It infects human cells when the S protein located on the surface of the coronavirus particle binds with high affinity to a protein exposed on the surface of the cells in the respiratory tract. Binding occurs through the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, akin to several other coronaviruses, uses angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u20102 (ACE\u20102) as an entry port into a lung cell [1].",

It suggested that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 emerged naturally, through a recombination of at least two viruses: a bat \u03b2\u2010coronavirus (\u03b2\u2010CoV) (genus Rhinolophus) and a pangolin \u03b2\u2010CoV, neither of which normally infects humans [2]. The bat \u03b2\u2010CoV is 96% similar to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but it has a divergent receptor\u2010binding domain in the S protein (only 60% similar to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) and binds poorly to human ACE\u20102. This makes it unlikely to enter human cells. The pangolin \u03b2\u2010CoV is only 90% similar to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but the RBD of its S protein has 99% similarity with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and it has high affinity to ACE\u20102 [3]. In fact, its affinity to ACE\u20102 is higher than that of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 RBD, as indicated in two recent studies [4, 5].",

The RBD from the pangolin virus has additional implications for the infectious nature of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. It harbours a furin enzyme cleavage site. Cleavage of the S protein at a furin cleavage site facilitates the entry of many viruses, including influenza viruses and CoVs into human cells. The importance of proteolytic cleavage at the furin cleavage site for the zoonotic transmission of viruses is in part based on experimental data with the MERS\u2010like CoV from bats, which cannot efficiently enter human cells, unless small amounts of trypsin protease are added to the virion to mimic the furin cleavage of the S protein [6]. Interestingly, the ability of the S protein to be cleaved by the cellular furin protease is readily lost when CoVs are propagated in cell cultures, as shown with a feline CoV [7]. This implies that the acquisition of the furin cleavage site might be a gain of function for CoVs, but is lost when virus is amplified in cell cultures (Scheme 1).",

A study performed on that ship showed that when social distancing was not implemented in the early phase of the epidemic, the transmission factor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was in the range of 15. This means that each infected person on the boat transferred the infection on average to 15 uninfected individuals.

These and other claims in this study are, however, highly controversial (for discussion see Ref. [12]).

Yet, the coronaviruses encode several accessory proteins which reduce the error rate to about 1 in 0.5\u20132 million bases [13, 14]. This means that only one out of 15\u201360 progeny viruses has a single point mutation in its genome. This is much lower than other RNA viruses and renders coronaviruses genetically rather stable, unless they recombine their genomes with a related CoV. In addition, the vast majority of the mutations have no phenotype, and they do not change viral infectivity. So, the good news is that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a low mutation rate (just one or two nucleotides a month, compared to four\u2013eight nucleotides a month in influenza virus). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the circulating virus has mutated to a more aggressive phenotype from November 2019 to March 2020.",

Cell culture experiments showed that this mutation caused a severe loss of fitness [15]. As the 29\u2010nucleotide deletion happened early on in the epidemics, it may have contributed to the disappearance of SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 in 2003.

If this works, it can be scaled up and used for patients with acute infection, in order to reduce the viral load. However, this approach is expensive and may be difficult to distribute because it involves biologicals which are subject to denaturation if stored improperly, or not kept in a cold chain. In addition, it is unclear how long\u2010lasting the effects of antivirals can be, because drug\u2010resistant viruses will inevitably emerge.
