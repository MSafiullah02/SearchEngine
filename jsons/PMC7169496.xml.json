            "text": "The Japanese earthquake and the related tsunami are actual examples of cosmopolitical events and their possible effects. They show that the \u2018social normal\u2019 can easily and thoroughly be shattered, endangered and ruined. Due to global media communication (eg http://www.cnn.com, http://www.cbs.com; http://www.ntv.de) we fiercely follow \u2013 in real time \u2013 a multi\u2010layered catastrophe that ties harmful natural and artificial forces with the endangerment of human life. It emerges as an event because of how it enforces a brutal stop and thorough change of common social and cultural life, destroys infrastructures, and generates political helplessness, societal controversies, and economic slumps. In Fukushima Dai\u2010ichi, it has lead to the breakdown of a nuclear power plant, which has turned the supposedly low or residual risk of a nuclear accident into an occurring catastrophe with uncertain and unknown denouements. The earthquake and its effects name a truly cosmopolitical event that radically unsettles and endangers the orders of human and non human\u2010life as well as it disrupts, questions and changes the institutionalized contrivances of societal relations. Such an event describes a dramatic occurrence, the emergence of some incident in an unforeseeable way, which is nevertheless contingent, not necessary: it happened, but it could as well not have happened, and it is neither predictable nor reproducible. But once it has taken place, it conditions facts coming after it, of which it will become a constitutive part. It is unleashed by and generates the agency of a multiplicity of actors \u2013 human and non\u2010human alike. The Fukushima event unravels the most unsettling scenery since it articulates a highly technological irreversible process with possible adverse effects, which happens to be most difficult to govern safely. Such a crisis of human agency and its institutional settings unleashes the discussion of new forms of political imaginaries. Controversies arise concerning questions of how we live and how we want to live. The Japanese events and their effects initiated a global discussion concerning our cosmos that is exceedingly mediated by high\u2010risk technologies and disputes possible alternatives. What is decisive about the manifold consequences of the Japanese events is, that they exerted a nearness and entanglement between culture and nature, people and technologies, life and death, knowns and unknowns, the past, present and future. If we want to analyze such tight coupling of Otherness, we need to acknowledge first of all that social worlds cannot be understood as a mere human and/or rational affair. Rather, the social emerges as a risky and uncertain association of human and non\u2010human relations (Latour, 2005a).\n6\n It brings to the fore the social relevance of non\u2010human relations (natural and artificial) and the way these relations gain political agency. Consequently, if we consider it as a main objective of the social scientific agenda and its \u2018politics of imagination\u2019 (this issue; Hughes and Coser, 1994; Mills, 2000) to unravel, interrogate and politicize \u2018normalization\u2019, we always have to deal with the Other, the uncertain, the unknown, the non\u2010social, the non\u2010human that may also put at risk our own understanding of the social normal. It throws light on the multiple facets of what Ulrich Beck calls \u2018cosmopolitanization\u2019 (cf. Beck, 2006, 2009), ie empirical political processes and actors that unbutton normalization and reveal the eventfulness of social relations. These processes are political insofar as they multiply relevant actors, which configure and reconfigure the social \u2018cosmos\u2019 as a pluri\u2010versal event with contingent effects. The latter give agency to the non\u2010expected Other, the non\u2010normal, the non\u2010human, the non\u2010social, the un\u2010common. These \u2018Others\u2019 gain agency by unknotting, questioning and altering \u2018the normal\u2019 as a highly normative construct of situated power relations. Due to that, we sociologists are constantly forced to re\u2010imagine the possible actors and agency involved. In effect, supposedly standard, natural or pre\u2010given identities and differences that define the normal or pathological, the good or bad, the hegemonic or marginal come into view as the effect of situated human and non\u2010human relations that unfold their own, unpredictable realities.",

Hence, social research that insists on giving the \u2018non\u2010normal\u2019 a voice may also question the conventions of social sciences by means of constructing novel ways of conceiving the social. This does not mean to become sociologically unscientific. Quite on the contrary! Such a social scientific imagination underlines what natural scientists do in their everyday experimental, laboratory work: They create new associations, references and functions.\n7\n According to the Belgian philosopher Isabelle Stengers (2000: 92\u20137), science constructs our history to such an extent, that it is impossible for us to think that some facts could be otherwise. Science constitutes a collective as much as facts. This is one of the most striking characteristics of science, which consistently is made invisible: the intermingling and entanglement between the world of things and the world of humans, between facts and history. Or rather, their mutual constitution: If a collective creates a fact, the fact is in its turn also creating a collective:",

            "text": "A brief example may illustrate my point: Nanoscientists try to imitate the agency of dangerous or even life\u2010threatening viruses in order to fight tumours and immunize the healthy cells from future malign processes. The idea is that the artificial virus produces the fiction of being a dangerous virus and the tumour cell believes this fiction. In effect, the tumour cell destroys itself as a matter of protection against the fictive infection. The invention of artificial viruses is thought to multiply possibilities of cure and protection (Wagner, 2007). It is a scientific way to tackle bodily events and their malign effects by creating functions, references and new alliances between different entities. In this way the experimental setting of the lab is letting \u2018nature speak\u2019. \u2018Nature speaks\u2019 outside the lab when new technologies and drugs are developed and finally appear in clinical settings to possibly cure or appease illnesses. Obviously, such agents are not neutral and their \u2018nature\u2019 is a highly artificial construct that acts as if it were nature. Subsequently, the construction of facts and collectives is a highly normative one: new realities emerge, bodies are effectuated and communicated, new practices, norms and standards as well as unexpected side effects, risks or damages may occur. Insofar, scientific work is a risky affair since it not only tries to gain knowledge concerning events but also produces new ones. With the experiment, science creates an event and its effects employ a new way of arguing, a novel way of making facts themselves act. Consequently, scientific discussions among humans (and the way we deal with these outside the lab) will not be solved by humans alone, but the discussion will be joined by non\u2010human entities which will be recognised as \u2018authorised\u2019 to settle a debate, that is, \u2018to \u201cmake a difference\u201d between the different possible arguments of humans\u2019 (Stengers, 2000: 80).",

            "text": "This means that nature, science and technology are constitutive (and always also uncertain) parts of our embodied human social lives. A scientific proposition presents us with a fact, a function, a technology, or an artificial system that aspire to be recognised as members of our collective. Once constructed and accepted as a fact, our collective changes and brings into being \u2018state(s) of the world\u2019 (Callon, Lascoumes and Barthe, 2009: 20). A new collective emerges, of which the new techno\u2010scientific object is a member, and its introduction re\u2010distributes identities and roles of the collective. Stengers (2000) rightly points out that the scientific event (as any other event) makes a difference, but it does not signify it: one may acknowledge the creation of new modes of reason and work, without allowing this recognition to disempower us to imagine it differently. Hence, we are still free to negotiate, to discuss and be imaginative about what consequences in our lives the event should have. Obviously, cosmopolitical events become most problematic and dangerous matter of facts if their effects 1) do not multiply but restrict, exclude or endanger relevant actors and 2) constrain or erase the possibility of alternative politics of imagination. This begins with instrumentalizing experimental sciences as the gold standard to illustrate the discovery of the \u2018truth of facts\u2019, or that of a \u2018rational truth\u2019 (Stengers, 1997, 2000). Such a technocratic strategy subsequently dismisses the situated and relational character of experimental science that brought these facts/technologies into being in the first place. To conflate the complexity and uncertain practices of \u2018science in the making\u2019 (Latour, 1987) with the discovery of mere matter of facts is most problematic. It is irresponsible if we deal with technologies such as nuclear technology that may affect unmanageable adverse effects. Obviously, the capitalist short\u2010term thinking of risk\u2010calculation and its desire for profit play a main role in generating and fostering such irresponsibility. Once the implementation of technologies is driven by economic rationality and once technologies articulate nothing but the technocratic ratio \u2013 and this is precisely what governs the rhetoric of \u2018low probabilities\u2019 and \u2018residual risks\u2019\u2013 we are prone to catastrophes. Experiencing the Japanese events and the related Fukushima crisis we become aware of what it means if we do not respect the eventful, relational and heterogeneous character of a techno\u2010scientifically mediated social cosmos. We mistake uncertain \u2018things\u2019 as given matter of facts with controllable risk\u2010effects. In the moment this rationality of codifying uncertain things as controllable risk\u2010technologies breaks down, we are forced to accept the life\u2010threatening effects of failing techno\u2010scientific inventions without having the possibility to resist them. As already indicated, such a self\u2010imposed lack of resistance is closely related to the problem of asocialization (homogenisation), which disregards the social cosmos of creative scientific work composed by heterogeneous relations (natural, artificial and human). There is nothing creative \u2013 neither on the human or non\u2010human side \u2013 if failing technologies endanger our common future. If supposedly \u2018creative\u2019, \u2018low probability of high risk\u2019 technologies exclude the creativity to deal properly and imaginatively with possible negative or adverse consequences, then they are not creative but scientifically bad objects and asocial. In that sense, Fukushima was foreseeable since it documents the persisting indifference to the very uncertainties and complexities of heterogeneous relations, which cannot be governed merely by human rational risk calculation. This is precisely what the sociological attentive eye on Dingpolitik reveals: To be called social, relations have to respect the eventful, relational and heterogeneous complexity of human\u2010nonhuman associations. To outline this point I will refer to the Fukushima accident and its effects and I will try to map the specificities and ambivalences of cosmopolitical events.",

            "text": "At a moment's notice, Fukushima,\n8\n a city/prefecture formerly unknown to most of us, is turning into a second Chernobyl, a place we all know. 25 years ago, the worst\u2010case scenario of an uncontrolled nuclear fusion happened. Exposed to poisonous radiation many people (and animals) were killed and landscapes turned into contaminated desserts. Still today, humans suffer psychologically and socially or become bodily ill from Chernobyl effects (Petryna, 2002). The Bavarian forests of my home country Germany continue to be strongly contaminated. Boars living there are highly radioactive since they eat specific mushrooms; the next 300 years they remain contaminated (http://www.br-online.de/aktuell/bayern-25-jahre-nach-tschernobyl). The Chernobyl event brought about the terrible experience of a meltdown. We also gained robust knowledge about the possible dramatic and long\u2010term effects nuclear power plant accidents produce. Still, Fukushima names the same fiasco of mistaking the precariousness of human and non\u2010human relations for being a residual risk that can be dismissed. Thereby, the uncertainty, disputed and the hazardous nature of possible risks that define \u2018matters of concern\u2019 such as nuclear energy have been transformed into safe \u2018matter of facts\u2019 with a negligible residual risk.\n9\n Fukushima names the breakdown of technologically (and economically) mediated politics of imagination \u2013 driven by the rationality of low probability high risk \u2013 that tried to frame the future events of that technology as fixable matter of facts: calculable, predictable and secure. The consequences of this failure realise the probability and risks involved. We globally witness the transformation of a supposedly low risk technology into a catastrophic scenario with adverse effects. In effect, the practices that have been institutionalizing the social normalcy of residual risks come to their limits. The innovation of knowledge practices that have led to the creativity of technological imagination is overshadowed and corrupted by ignorance; it is replaced by an uttermost uncertain, endangered and angst\u2010ridden future where radioactive actors might do their politics for which we have no human sensory, no natural protection, no social modes of resistance. We fear being harmfully exposed to and enacted by the non\u2010sensorial. Consequently, the region around Fukushima has been widely evacuated and appears socially depleted. There is no dwelling possible and people are utterly disrupted and cut off from practices of \u2018keeping\u2019 relations (cf. Latimer and Munro, 2009). The event and its unruly effects affect people all over the world. In Germany, seemingly far away from any possible exposure, the Geiger\u2010Mueller counters were sold out (http://www.welt.de/; accessed 17/03/2011). In USA one had to register on a waiting list for iodine tablets although experts kept on assuring that there is no need to do so (http://www.cbs47.tv/; accessed 15/03/2011). These reactions show the worries about the bio\u2010political agency of non\u2010human others (clouds of radiation) that appear highly indifferent to territorial borders and national frames of references. Like for many other countries, the Japanese high\u2010risk nuclear technologies are systems that generate and intermediate social normalcy. As intermediaries these technologies transport social normalcy and related politics of imagining it. With the failure of the Fukushima plant these intermediaries of social normalcy turned into mediators. As mediators they transform social normalcy and become political actors that put into question given politics of imagining social reality.\n10\n The scale of action and its effects has changed as well. As intermediaries, the technology system was thought to stabilize local and regional networks. As mediators, these failing technologies produce trans\u2010local adverse effects. The latter may put into question the very normalcy of social orderings far beyond the local network itself.\n11\n The Japanese events realise what Ulrich Beck calls \u2018second order risks\u2019 (Beck, 1992, 2009). Second order risks transcend the idea of risks as mathematically, economically and scientifically calculable or economically insurable (first order risks); such risks extend beyond local, regional or national affairs. Moreover, they blur the differentiation of risk producer, risk decider and those affected by risks. Such \u2018systemic risks\u2019 and their effects (Jovanovic, Renn and Slavi, 2010) originate \u2013 as a \u2018normal\u2019 matter of fact \u2013 from complex assemblages of human and non\u2010human relations (Perrow, 1999; Urry, 2000). These assemblages protract widely into an unknown future where they may relate with other risks and risk effects. The synergies of systemic risks are highly difficult to deal with or to be compensated by common modes of institutionalized practices \u2013 like the insurance principle (economics), the nation\u2010state (politics), or expert knowledge (science). With Fukushima we realize that the politics of low probabilities and the calculation of related risks failed.",

            "text": "This failure turns our attention to the production of and dealings with highly politicized, globalizing second order risks and risk effects. Protests are forming worldwide against the politics of imagination which has been in favour of nuclear power. The German government has installed ad hoc a three\u2010month moratorium\n12\n concerning the running period of Germany's nuclear plants. The moratorium was set up by the German chancellor Merkel (a studied physicist) in a TV interview, who noted how Fukushima differs from the Chernobyl in one most important point. Unlike Chernobyl, the Fukushima event was not caused by human failure but affected by natural forces. Thus, the German government knows perfectly well that the realization of residual risks brings to the fore the uncertain social and political actors involved. In only a three\u2010day period, we could face a change concerning the political understanding of nuclear energy. It transformed from being a transitional but acquiescent technology that knows no efficient alternatives, into a high\u2010risk technology that is considered a discontinued model. In effect, half of Germany's nuclear plants' power production has been rapidly slowed down. The Bavarian President has argued that \u2018the residual risk\u2019 of a plane crashing into one of our nuclear plants has now turned into a \u2018real possibility\u2019 (TV Interview). Consequently, he intends to switch off the Bavarian \u2018Isar I\u2019, which is one of the oldest German nuclear power plants. Meanwhile, the situation in Fukushima was seen as \u2018out of control\u2019 and Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \u2018International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019, described the situation as \u2018very serious\u2019 (http://www.iaea.org/; accessed 16/03/2011). Officials moved up the INES (The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale) from \u20184\u2019 to \u20185\u2019. The scale switch indicates \u2018that the severity of an event is about ten times greater for each increase in level on the scale\u2019 (http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/ines.pdf). This also meant that the Fukushima \u2018incident\u2019 has turned into an \u2018accident\u2019: A \u2018serious incident\u2019 of scale 4 refers to an \u2018accident with local consequences\u2019 and an \u2018accident\u2019 of scale 5 names \u2018accidents with wider consequences\u2019 (ibid.). Later, the scale has raised from \u20186\u2019 (a \u2018serious accident\u2019) to \u20187\u2019 which names a \u2018major accident\u2019 with \u2018major release of radioactive material\u2019 and \u2018significant effects on health and the environment\u2019 (http://www.allvoices.com/; accessed 11/04/2001).",

It is both the immateriality, ie the intensity of time (time pressure, lack of time) and the materiality of time (technologically mediated time provoked by technological failure), which thoroughly interrogate institutionalized social practices that appear as the backbone of enduring \u2018societies\u2019.\n13\n Events like Fukushima bring to the fore highly non\u2010institutionalized, experimental forms of action precisely since there are no institutionalized settings available that would be capable to relate the past, present and future in a way that things can be anticipated, accounted for, believed in. Institutions, to be sure, are installed to reduce the complexity and contingency of future events. Through institutions we are able to count on the present to deal with the future. Thereby, the contingency of future events gains a sense of certainty and security; through institutions we create options for planning, anticipating, endurance and stability. As we can see with Fukushima, this includes the institutionalization of technologies, which \u2013 in a worst\u2010case scenario \u2013 cannot be dealt with anymore by given institutionalized means. We humans are not able to (inter\u2010)mediate these human/non\u2010human relations in a safe, sustainable and social way. Rather, the failing technology objects to our human partaking and endangers human well\u2010being and relevant social relations. Affected by the event, the nuclear plant, which was meant as a good signature of technocratically mediated politics of low probability high risks, has changed into an event with adverse effects. The technological system transformed from being a reliable social associate into a rather aggressive political actor that disrupts, questions, alters and even destroys given modes of orderings. In effect, the unknown, insecure und uncertain future rules our present enacting the risk of a catastrophe. We are caught within and by the event of the no longer and not yet. Even eight weeks after the event, nobody knows if the nuclear plant (or some of its reactors) may burst soon or if the ad hoc experiments (cooling attempts, regaining electric energy) will succeed. What makes Fukushima such a dramatic experience is that we are confronted with a monstrous technological agent that is highly indifferent to our human concerns, engineering and politics. With Fukushima we experience the thorough questioning of the normative imaginary of cosmopolitics as a mere human affair. Cosmopolitical events like Fukushima interrogate the standards set by the human politics of technologically mediated imagination that fix the \u2018cosmos\u2019 and \u2018politics\u2019 as a given.

What makes us moderns so successful is to extend agency to technologies (Latour, 1993). We know about the risks this may entail, but we often underestimate the (possible) agency of all the related non\u2010human others. In the case of Fukushima, nuclear plant does what it does, but not in the way it was imagined by us, ie to sustain a complex techno\u2010rationally mediated network. Rather, the earthquake and the tsunami event re\u2010assembled the Fukushima network in a most dramatic way, so much so that the supposedly creative but also most precarious connectivity between human and non\u2010human relations broke down. Through the event, we humans are excluded from our own technologically mediated world. We witness highly \u2018asymmetrical power relations\u2019 (Latimer, 2004) where failing technologies \u2018command\u2019 (ibid.) their self\u2010referential material effects.

Those affected humans (next to animals and plants) are enacted as rather poor agentic members of a self\u2010manufactured network. They have no good ability to object to the future provided by the failed reality of the Fukushima system. The latter radically narrowed down the options to deal collectively (ie cosmopolitically) with our \u2018manufactured risks\u2019 (cf. Beck, 1992).

Fukushima has been an actual empirical occurrence of such a cosmopolitical event and related effects. The specificities of the Japanese events unravel questions and problems which unfold a most general concern of the politics of sociological imagination: the social. I agree with Michel Callon and others that we should be careful that the discussion of events is not about dissecting rare cases of science and technology and \u2018treating each issue separately, as if it is always a case of exceptional events\u2019 (Callon, Lascoumes and Barthe, 2009: 9).

The relevance of cosmopolitical events is measured by the way they introduce and affect differences \u2013 both in the way they disrupt, question and alter social relations and in the way we social scientists and others observe these processes of transformation. Next to the dramatic adverse effects, the Japanese events also initiated a worldwide debate on energy politics and \u2018possible states of the world\u2019 (Callon/Lascoumes and Barthe, 2009: 20). Protests, reflections and discussions concerning the future of (nuclear) energy are happening at different places, by and between a diversity of discussants. Another example from Germany may illustrate my point: Without trying to evaluate \u2018ethic committees\u2019in medias res, it is worth noting that in Germany, next to varied public protests and other political activities, an ethic committee has been founded that is meant to discuss the future of nuclear energy. An ethic committee is a common tool for consensus\u2010 and expert\u2010oriented politics. What happened to be different this time was, that the meetings have been broadcasted live by television. At the same time, sites of public viewing have been created to follow the daylong discussions. While public viewings showed that questions concerning nuclear energy (on a national and trans\u2010national level) were critically discussed, they also debated the political role of \u2018ethic committees\u2019, including the perspectives articulated, and who is part of the committee, who excluded. So what we can see is a double process of politicization: 1) The politicization of the social relevance of technology and science, and 2) the politicization of the different ways politics is performed. To be sure, it remains rather uncertain what will be the future effects of Fukushima, for German energy politics for example. What appears observable, though, is a multiplication of actors, voices, assessments and political practices involved that render nuclear energy as a disputed matter of concern. Thus, by corrupting the \u2018normal\u2019, the effects of exceptional cosmopolitical events like Fukushima uncover the complexity of the \u2018social normal\u2019 as a disputed matter of concern. These events question, disrupt, alter, or even destroy given matter of facts. They bring to the fore the multiple and collective dimension of the social, which is essentially an uncertain process of associating humans and non\u2010humans (cf. Latour, 2005a). Moreover, diverse political actors \u2013 again humans and non\u2010humans \u2013 which have not been considered to be true or relevant political actors before the event, have and/or gain significant voices after the event. The history of nuclear energy (eg in Germany and even more so in France) shows that nuclear energy was seen as a technical issue of scientific experts and not a collective matter of concern, ie a social problem (cf. Callon, Lascoumes and Barthe, 2009). Such a technocratization of scientific innovations and their effects is closely linked and stabilized by a political \u2018rational discourse\u2019 that was thought as a deliberative mode of discourse to do justice to the demands of techno\u2010scientific \u2018matter of facts\u2019. As we know, the rationalization of politics also meant an aggressive mistrust concerning all other political voices (lay and ordinary citizens, NGO's) which where labelled as irrelevant, irrational and being nihilistic to the technological future (ibid.). The technocratic and rationalist discourse goes hand in hand with an economisation of new techno\u2010scientific innovations. Economists have to presuppose reliable and objective matter of facts to make risky calculations, good trade and better profit; they dislike uncertainties and with it those actors and agencies which turn matters of facts into matters of concern (ibid. 228). Thus, the \u2018democracy\u2019 of techno\u2010scientific innovations of eg nuclear power refers to the co\u2010existence of technocratization, rationalization and economization. They all support as well as foster a discourse that is meant to meet the requirements of techno\u2010rational matter of facts. What is striking about this perspective is that the downplay and exclusion of the social and political dimension only plays a role in order to stress the very social and political (or even cosmopolitical\n14\n) importance for our collective future. Nuclear energy was/is meant to be a central actor that represents the safeguard of a future\u2010oriented, techno\u2010scientific mediated social and politics. Thus, it is the matter of facts of technocratic rationalist and economists that frame the social and political relevance of nuclear energy, which is meant to secure a safe and prosperous collective life. Thereby, the uncertainties of associating humans and non\u2010humans as well as the possibility of political actors other than techno\u2010rational experts have been excluded or downsized to low probabilities of risk! To be sure, since the 1950s nuclear energy has become more and more \u2018socialized\u2019 and \u2018politicised\u2019. But despite the social and political \u2018proliferation\u2019 (Strathern, 1999) within Western countries, nuclear energy remained a strong intermediary between technocratization, rationalization and economization. Till today, for many countries nuclear energy plays the role model of a good modern mode of future\u2010oriented politics of imagination that turns social uncertainties and political dissent into pre\u2010given facts of calculable and manageable risks. That these most \u2018safe\u2019 technologies are continuingly producing more or less dangerous and non\u2010manageable accidents that caused and are causing sufferings and deaths, that nuclear testing has destroyed many regions all over the world, that we produce an enormous amount of nuclear waste, is accepted as part of such a \u2018good\u2019 future of the politics concerning the politics of risk calculation.",

In consequence, it not only takes the uncertainties of \u2018nature\u2019 as being calculable, but also renders them as human rational matter of facts.

            "text": "Obviously, for social sciences the diagnosed symmetry between and the co\u2010constituency of human and non\u2010human actors are vital in understanding the social and political dimension(s) of science and technology. The notion of \u2018actor\u2010network\u2019 conceived by scholars from Science and Technology Studies (STS) seems to be a fruitful notion since it tries to capture precisely the idea that the reality of entities, human and non\u2010human alike, including their abilities and disabilities, are the effect of uncertain processes of associated/ing heterogeneous entities (Callon, 1986, 1991; Latour, 2005a; Law and Hassard, 1999). Following from that, agency is not a human given. Rational facts or low probability and calculable risks are possible outcomes of controversial processes, ie relational effects and no givens. Scholars of Actor\u2010Network\u2010Theory (ANT) call this process of eventful and thus uncertain association, mediation or translation (ibid.). Only through translation does the composite of our world come into being, endures and/or changes. Actors can be understood as mediated mediators, and not substances, essences or matter of facts. As we have seen with Fukushima, the elements involved may differ in the ways they work as associates: they can be either \u2018intermediaries\u2019 or \u2018mediators\u2019. An intermediary \u2018transports meaning or force without transformation\u2019, whereas mediators \u2018transform, translate, distort, and modify the meaning or the elements they are supposed to carry\u2019 (Latour, 2005a: 39ff). An actor\u2010network, then, addresses fragile sociality as a process of association that transports and transforms reality. It also makes us aware that we live \u2018 \u201cin\u201d extension\u2019 (Latimer, 2000; Latimer, 2004; Latimer and Birke, 2009; Latimer and Munro, 2009; Latimer and Schillmeier, 2009; Munro, 1996; Munro, 2005; Strathern, 1993) with other humans as well as with non\u2010humans (artefacts and natural environment). These extensions may intermediate (transport) but also mediate (transform) time and space. What we could see with the effects of cosmopolitical events such as Fukushima: is that they question the idea of technologies as mere intermediaries of human rationality and highlight the mediation of social relations by non\u2010human actors. Large scale and high\u2010risk technologies like Fukushima are most important actors that protract widely into the future. Despite being treated as mere matter of facts, Fukushima shows their vulnerability. Imagined as a \u2018good\u2019 transporter it turned into a \u2018bad\u2019 mediator. Since the events of the earthquake and the related Tsunami, the Fukushima plant maps its own reality without us humans to be able to trace it in the way that we would be able to become \u2018equal\u2019 parts of the network. Thus, nobody (no technocratic scientist, no rationalist politician, no economical risk taker) is able tame or govern Fukushima with the institutionalized practices that made it real in the first place: The nuclear power plant re\u2010gains social reality by producing adverse future effects. These effects realize indisputable matter of facts which cannot merely be discussed away by rational actors. Thus, we are enacted as rather poor experimenters \u2018in contact with the real\u2019 (Deleuze and Guattari, [1980] 1987: 13), precisely because we took the nuclear plants as calculable and safe \u2018matter of facts\u2019 and excluded the social relevance and political power of non\u2010human actors. Actor\u2010networks like Fukushima which may turn into catastrophes, are not only about the fragile connectivity of human and non\u2010human agency, but gain their own reality by cutting off human agency from a network that is co\u2010initiated by and meant for humans. Actor\u2010networks come into being by a strange double bind of attachment and detachment. The reality of Fukushima is as much the effect of connecting human and non\u2010human relations as much as it is about being detaching and endangering human and non\u2010human networks.",

As Goffman rightly argues, hot Umwelten not only affect our \u2018safety\u2019, but our global \u2018situation\u2019 appears \u2018deeply unsettling\u2019 (ibid. 329) and utterly endangered due to \u2018the physical objects and events around\u2019 the human being (ibid. 328). It would be missing the point, to separate off the natural causes of the event from its societal effects that will govern them. The unsettling events in Japan make us realise that the idea of cosmopolitanism is neither a human only affair as Kant would have it, nor does it sustain a scientific model that purifies itself from social and political practices by pointing out scientific matter of facts that speak for themselves as \u2018rational truths\u2019. Consequently, the humanist dream of a \u2018world society\u2019 governed by techno\u2010rational procedures turn into destructive effects of a \u2018world experiment society\u2019. The latter not only lacks laboratory control of scientific experiments but also multiplies the power of non\u2010human beings to object to institutionalized forms of human rational action. Thus, the politics of imagining \u2018matter of fact\u2019\u2010realities, which were thought to generate and sustain social normalcy, multiply prospects of catastrophes.

In effect, it draws our attention to the eventful character of the social. Experiencing Fukushima, the unbuttoning of normalcy is very much about the uncertainty and precariousness of rationalized politics of imagination, the multiplicity of its actors, its failures as well as the possibility of offering alternatives by novel actors. Such a cosmopolitical view neither exhausts in consulting the clever scientist alone, nor does it have to relate to the conventions of consensus\u2010oriented politics or stick to the economies of risk calculation. Quite on the contrary, good science means to multiply actors and related politics of imagination that may question, disrupt and alter the common link between scientific, political and economical modes of observation. It extends the history of sociological imagination to the social and political relevance of the non\u2010human. The cosmopolitical view will enrich the process of unfolding research agendas and conceptual space for those that have been excluded, marginalized, forgotten, unconsidered, or disfigured in the process of normalizing social and political action.
