The second category includes one of the most difficult criteria to assess, but the most important in terms of public health effects\u2014namely, the clinical severity of human infections, which is estimated by measures such as the case fatality risk.5 The seriousness of infections has major implications for the potential overall severity of an influenza pandemic.3 However, assessment of severity is challenging because typically the most serious illnesses associated with infection have a much higher probability of being detected and laboratory confirmed than do mild illnesses.6\n",

First, with the assumption that no immunity is present in any age group, the pattern in age-specific incidence of serious cases is not consistent with presumed patterns in exposure, implying that severity increases with age and that many undetected mild infections have occurred in adults.17 Second, six of the 131 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 28, 2013, were identified via national sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance (including the most recent case, reported on May 28 in Beijing), which is a population-wide system for measurement of patterns in consultation of patients with ILI and virological testing for influenza virus infections in a subset of patients.18, 19 Of the six cases (aged 2\u201326 years), only one developed pneumonia, and the other five cases had uncomplicated illness. Because this surveillance system is based on a sampling approach, laboratory confirmation of the six cases implies a substantial number of unconfirmed symptomatic infections with mild to moderate illness.",

Because some patients died without requiring mechanical ventilation, we grouped two outcomes together to estimate the risk of mechanical ventilation or death, for which the alternative outcome is recovery without ventilation. For the same reason, we estimated risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death versus recovery without ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, or both.",

We combined these data with the daily number of all ILI cases reported and specimens tested by ILI surveillance in the two cities to infer the number of infected individuals who would have sought medical care at ILI sentinels (NILI-S; appendix). We then used two alternative methods to estimate the number of symptomatic infections in Shanghai and Nanjing. With method 1, we assumed that health-care-seeking behaviour of individuals with ILI associated with infection with the influenza A H7N9 virus was the same as health-care-seeking behaviour for those with ILI associated with the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic virus infection. We used data from a nationwide serosurvey and ILI surveillance of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic virus in China from June, 2009, to January, 2010,23 to estimate the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who sought medical care at ILI sentinels. We divided NILI-S by this proportion (appendix). With method 2, we assumed that all cases of ILI associated with infection with influenza A H7N9 virus sought medical care, and we estimated the number of symptomatic cases on the basis of the proportions of outpatient consultations at the sentinel locations compared with the total number of consultations in Shanghai and Nanjing (appendix). After estimating the number of mild cases in Shanghai and Nanjing, we extrapolated our estimate to the rest of mainland China on the basis of the proportion of patients with H7N9 admitted to hospital in those two cities (ie, pro rata).

Second, although we could estimate age-specific fatality risks, we could not estimate age-specific symptomatic-case risks in our analyses; further work is needed in this area. Third, our estimates of the number of symptomatic cases by two methods were based on extrapolation from the sentinel ILI network, and necessitated several simplifying assumptions, such as no geographical differences in ascertainment of patients admitted to hospital and no changes in health-care-seeking behaviour in late March, and early April, 2013. Our analysis could be biased if there were additional undetected hospital admissions associated with avian influenza A H7N9\u2014eg, because of poor access to laboratory testing in some areas\u2014or if health-care attendance was increased in view of the perceived severity of this novel infection. Fourth, without data for the proportion of subclinical or asymptomatic infections, we cannot estimate the fatality risk for all infected individuals (ie, not just the risk for those admitted to hospital). Such information might be available from serological studies in future.40 Finally, clinical information about some laboratory-confirmed cases was not available, and standardised collection and sharing of clinical data would assist risk assessment and treatment.41\n",

As with seasonal influenza, the severity of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection increases with age. Our findings will inform risk assessment and health policy during the present H7N9 outbreak, and will assist preparations for a potential resurgence in human infections towards the end of 2013.11 Our framework could be used for pandemic risk assessment of future avian influenza viruses that cause disease in people.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed on May 28, 2013, with the terms \u201cA(H7N9)\u201d or \u201cH7N9\u201d for articles published in English since Jan 1, 2013. We also searched articles available online from international medical and infectious disease journals. We did not identify any reports of human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus before 2013. Some reports of the present H7N9 outbreak in people in China divided the number of deaths by the number of laboratory-confirmed cases,9, 10, 28, 29, 30 and one of these studies clarified that this approach may underestimate the confirmed-case fatality risk, because some patients remain in hospital.10 Other studies reported the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and the number of deaths without attempts to infer the case fatality risk.1, 13, 18, 24, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 One published report suggested that at least 210\u2013550 symptomatic infections with the avian influenza A H7N9 virus in China had occurred by April 21, 2013, on the basis of patterns in incidence compared with presumed patterns in exposure.17 We did not identify any other report in which estimation of the number of symptomatic cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection or the symptomatic case fatality risk was attempted.\nInterpretation\nWe have shown that human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus might be less serious than has been previously reported. Although most patients with laboratory-confirmed infection needed to be admitted to hospital and most of these required admission to intensive care units, the fatality risk for patients with avian influenza A H7N9 infection who were admitted to hospital of 36% seems to be lower than that for influenza A H5N1 in China (65%)31 and worldwide (60%),32 but higher than that for the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic virus (21%). Identification of five laboratory-confirmed cases in a network of 554 sentinel hospitals conducting surveillance of influenza-like illness in outpatients in China is indicative of a much larger number of mild cases. Our findings will inform risk assessment and health policy during the present H7N9 outbreak, and will assist preparations for a potential resurgence in human infections towards the end of 2013.11 Our framework could be used for pandemic risk assessment of future avian influenza viruses that cause disease in people.",
