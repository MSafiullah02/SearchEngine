Design Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. setting PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the metaanalysis. Participants The confirmed cases of COVID- 19 . results A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). Conclusions The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.",

It was determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. 4 Therefore, it is critical to understand and identify the key clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in order to help in early detection and isolation of infected individuals, as well as minimise the spread of the disease. 5 Although a number of studies have attempted to explore this subject, most of them were single-centre studies that were conducted in a specific hospital or region. Due to differences in study design and small samples, the clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and other key outcomes of these studies are complicated and unclear. [6] [7] [8] For example, two recent systematic reviews 9 10 of studies of patients with COVID-19 indicated a high incidence of fever (>88%) and cough (>68%), but only one 10 reported symptoms of myalgia or fatigue (35.8%). Both reviews meta-analysed small samples pooled from 10 studies.",

Otherwise, potential sources of clinical heterogeneity were identified using subgroup and sensitivity analyses; these sources were eliminated, and the meta-analysis was repeated using a random-effects model. Pooled incidence rates R were back-calculated from transformed rates tr using the R=[sin (tr / 2)]. 2 A two-tailed p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The studies included in this analysis comprise the latest research available on COVID-19 through 16 March 2020. Our results indicate that there is a slightly higher proportion of male patients (53.3%) and that the main symptoms of this disease are fever (78.4%), cough (58.3%) and fatigue (34%). Compared with previous results, 9 10 our findings reveal lower incidence rates of the two major symptoms of this disease, which we found to depend to some extent on whether diagnosis was made before or after 31 January 2020, reflecting with the progress of the epidemic, the number of atypical manifestations has growed gradually. For example, some patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. These results highlight the importance of also taking into account non-respiratory symptoms of the disease. Most patients with COVID-19 showed normal leucocyte counts and lymphopqenia. Few patients had leucocytosis and elevated procalcitonin levels, confirming that this disease is transmitted by a virus. Therefore, it is essential for clinicians to use such pathological findings to rule out the presence of bacterial infections. In this study, 49.4% of the patients presented with myocardial enzyme spectrum abnormalities, which manifested as an increase in lactate dehydrogenase levels. Studies have shown that elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase can be a risk factor for rapid progression from mild to critical COVID-19. 65 Therefore, monitoring the function of important organs during treatment is critical, and treatment should be adjusted as needed to preserve and maintain organ function.",

An analysis by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted through 17 February 2020 suggested that the proportion of asymptomatic patients was only around 1%, 67 but our results suggest that the proportion is closer to 5%. This increase may reflect the growing experience of hospitals with this novel disease and increasing screening of suspected COVID-19 cases for viral infection, allowing the correct diagnosis of greater proportions of patients showing no or less typical manifestations. Therefore, to control the spread of this disease, general practitioners should carefully monitor individuals with histories of contact in areas where outbreaks have occurred or who had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 within 14 days before onset of symptoms. 68 Epidemiological history of patients should be investigated in detail, and asymptomatic infected people in the community should be identified as quickly as possible to control spread of the disease.",

General practitioners act as both gatekeepers and health promoters by educating the public and guiding the community in the fight against this disease. 71 Monitoring people at designated checkpoints, intercepting transmission routes in a timely manner and preventing local outbreaks are critical to prevent repeat epidemics. 72 Although this study rigorously analysed clinical and laboratory data collected from a large sample of patients with COVID-19, we were unable to eliminate the significant heterogeneity observed between studies. For example, the course and the severity of the disease varied across studies. Given that most of the studies included in our meta-analysis were single-centre, retrospective studies, it was difficult for us to control for the effects of several confounding factors, including bias in patient admission and selection, as well as differences in disease severity and course. Further research is required to verify and extend our results for China. Continued surveillance across multiple countries, along with transparent and accurate reporting of patient characteristics and testing policies, will help us gain a better understanding of this global pandemic. 73 COnClusIOn In summary, Current evidence showed that the most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, Open access chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease. Due to limited quality and quantity of the included studies, more highquality prospective studies are required to verify above conclusions.",
