The mixing performance of the active micromixer was evaluated in aqueous-aqueous systems including dyes for visual observation. A complete analytical microfluidic system was developed by integrating various functional modules into a single chip, thus allowing cell lysis, sample preparation, purification of intracellular molecules, and subsequent analysis. Upon loading the cell samples and lysis solution into the mixing chamber, the integrated microfluidic device allows efficient cell disruption by rotation of a micromagnetic disk and control of mixing time using the Teflon-coated hydrophobic film as a microvalve. This inflow is followed by separating the cell debris and contaminated proteins from the cell lysate sample using the acrylamide (AAm)-functionalized SPE. The inflow of partially purified cell lysate sample containing the gold binding polypeptide (GBP)-fusion protein was bound onto the gold micropatterns by means of its metal binding affinity. The GBP-fusion method allows immobilization of proteins in bioactive forms onto the gold surface without surface modification suitable for studying antigen-antibody interaction. It was used for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious viral disease, as an example case.",

Mixing in these passive mixers is typically accomplished by driving fluids through channels with sophisticated and fixed geometries [15, 16] . The passive mixing system often requires expensive equipment for 3-D fabrication process [9, 17] , or a relatively long mixing length to achieve strong chaotic advection. Also, it is less suited for mixing fluids in a chamber as it occurs while the fluid passes through the specific channel geometry [18] . Compared with the passive mixers, active mixers can be activated on-demand, and thus mixing can be achieved at very low flow velocities. In these mixers, mixing performance can be improved by periodic perturbation or chaotic advection of the flow fields. Some of the methods used in active mixers include electroosmotic actuation [19] , bubble-induced acoustic actuation [20] [21] [22] electrokinetic pressure [23] , and ultrasonic mixing using integrated transducers [24] . However, it has not been easy to integrate these micromixers with other in-plane microfluidic components because they require external power sources and additional on-chip wiring. It has also been of a great concern that these methods can damage the biological samples.",

The micromixer described in this paper is based on the same mixing principles of the large-scale magnetic stirrer. A major advantage of this magnetic stirrer in macroscopic mixing system is its ability to allow a convenient yet efficient blending without creating complex structures. The stirrer-type mixers allow appropriate mixing by providing more interfacial area rather than inducing turbulence in microscale. Furthermore, externally applied magnetic actuation eliminates the need to tether wires and reduces the control complexity. And also, it allows effective mixing in a large reaction chamber for sequential flow analysis [25] [26] [27] . In this study, the microdisk embedded in the microchamber was developed to facilitate an effective mixing within seconds in the reaction chamber by applying external rotating magnetic field. This micromixer was applied to rapidly mix two aqueous solutions. In addition, a novel integrated microfluidic system was developed to allow cell lysis, sample driving/ mixing, separation, and bioanalysis [2, 4, 28, 29] . Thus, the fully integrated microfluidic device reported here should allow miniaturization of bioanalytical system and can be used in various high-throughput analysis of biomolecules and chemicals.",

Two streams, the cell solution and LS were introduced from the respective inlets and mixed in the micromixer. The microvalves (V1 and V2) filled with micropillars and coated with Teflon AF in a microchannel were used to control the mixing time and to keep both solutions in the mixing chamber (Fig. 1C) . A simple and effective hydrophobic surface preparation method using a spin-coated Teflon film and lift-off process was carried out to control the surface wettability for fluidic handling. In order to fabricate the microvalves (Fig. 1B) , the glass substrate was previously coated with amorphous fluoropolymer, poly(tetrafluoro ethylene-co-2,2-bis-trisfluoromethyl-4,5-difluoro-1,3-dioxole) (trade name: Teflon AF 1600, DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA) using 1 wt% solution of Teflon AF 1600 in Fluorinert FC-75 solvent (DuPont) at room temperature with a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the glass substrate was baked at 707C for 5 min. Using the hydrophobic PDMS surface area enlargement by the micropillar array, we can manipulate the flow stop to a given region in a microchannel network.

The detailed procedure for fabricating the SPE unit by in situ polymerization is described in Fig. 2 . The partially purified lysate sample from the acrylamide (AAm) functionalized SPE chamber ( Fig. 1D ) was introduced into the gold micropatterned chamber, and then a target protein fused to the GBP was attached on the gold surface (Fig. 1E ). The specific anti-SARS antibody as a reaction sample (RS) and buffer solution as a control sample (CS) were flown into the gold micropatterned chamber which has immobilized target protein fused to the GBP.

A peak in the current was observed due to the decrease of mediator access to the gold electrode surface and the expansion of the diffusion layer by self assembled monolayer (SAM) with time.

Thus we developed a micromixer which allows efficient mixing by using a magnet embedded in the mixing chamber. In this micromixing system, a rotating external magnetic field would cause the magnet to rotate in the mixing chamber. It was magnetized along the horizontal axis under an external magnetic field. When in use, it was placed in the center of the chamber (see the Supporting Information). The mixing performance for micromagnetic mixer was evaluated using black-and whitedyed aqueous solutions. In order to examine the mixing performance, we designed the simple micromagnetic mixer consisted of two inlet ports (width of 200 mm6height of 50 mm) for delivering each sample solution, the mixing chamber containing magnet disk, analysis zone (id of 3.3 mm and height of 2.0 mm) for obtaining an optical image, and two outlet ports. Two discrete solutions, blackand white-dyed aqueous sample were injected into inlet ports. After carrying out mixing at the mixing chamber, an optical microscope was used to monitor the fluid mixing and color change as the sample solution passed over the analysis zone near to the outlet channel. Figure 3 shows the time-dependent changes of the mixing index with increase in the rpm of magnet in the range of 50-500 rpm. White-and black-colored solutions enter the mixing chamber in laminar flows at the rate of 0.5 mL/h. After the waiting period (10 s) to allow the fluids to become laminar flows, mixing was initiated by turning on the external magnetic stirrer for 10 s. The mixed solution proceeded to the next analysis zone where the mixing index was evaluated. The gray scale intensities across the width of the analysis zone from acquired experimental images were analyzed for 10 s. Once stopped, the device was allowed to reach laminar flow again. Each result was averaged and the reproducibility was checked via triplicate experiments. As shown in Fig. 3A , the mixing index decreased with increase in rotating speed of magnet (50-500 rpm). Full mixing is defined as the status giving the mixing index of less than 0.2. At low stirring speed of magnet (50-200 rpm), full mixing could not be achieved within 10 s. On the other hand, the mixing index became less than 0.2 within the mixing times of 9.6, 7.6, and 6.6 s when the magnet speeds were 300, 400, and 500 rpm, respectively. Thus, as expected, the higher the mixing speed of the magnet, the faster the full mixing was. Figure 3B shows the captured video images of mixing at the analysis zone with the increase in mixing time at the magnet rotation speed of 500 rpm. The analysis zone examined without rotation of magnetic disk showed no mixing, showing the image similar to that of 0 s in Fig. 3B . When the magnet started to rotate, it exerted shear forces on the fluids causing the circular motion. The color histogram was analyzed based on the captured sequential images of fluid colors at the analysis zone. As the fluids were mixed, the gray color became more uniformly distributed, as represented by the decreasing undulation of surface plot in the color histogram. The complete mixing was achieved in a short period of time (6.6 s) at the magnet rotation speed of 500 rpm. Thus, the active micromagnetic mixer system developed in this study is suitable for the full mixing of fluids on a microfluidic chip.",

Using this active micromagnetic mixer, a fully integrated microfluidic system, sometimes referred to as micrototal analysis system (m-TAS), was developed. This system allows cell lysis, SPE, and subsequent analysis to be performed on a single microdevice. Two sample solutions, cellresuspended buffer and LS, respectively were injected into the mixing (cell lysis) chamber from the respective inlets. The extent of cell lysis depended on the mixing homogeneity and mixing residence time. Figure 4 shows the efficiency of cell lysis with increase in mixing time and magnet rotation speed. To quantify the efficiency of cell disruption, the number of cells after the lysis was counted. As shown in Fig. 4 , the efficiency of cell lysis increased with increase in mixing time and higher magnet rotation speed. As the mixing time increased to 20 min, the cell lysis efficiency was greater than 90% at the magnet rotation speed of 300-500 rpm. More than 90% of cells were lysed within 10 min at the speed of 500 rpm. However, the efficiency of cell lysis was below 80% at the low rotation speed of 100-200 rpm due to the limited mixing of cell suspension and the organic lysis reagent. The Re values increased sharply to 11.31, 33.30, and 71.00 at the magnet rotation speeds of 300, 400, and 500 rpm, respectively. On the other hand, the Re values were low at 0.82 and 2.83 when the magnet rotation speed was 100 and 200 rpm, respectively.",

It was caused by the increased cell disruption by the organic lysis reagent, and the homogeneity of cell lysate increased with the cell disruption time. Based on these results, disruption of cells could be performed successfully by mixing at 500 rpm only for 10 min. After cell lysis, the EB was introduced into the lysis chamber to allow the lysated sample solution to flow into the SPE chamber. The debris and contaminated materials were removed by functionalized SPE. The AAm-functionalized SPE is able to adsorb proteins that are negatively charged under a given buffer pH condition by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged adsorbent and the negatively charged protein molecules. Thus, the AAm-functionalized SPE in the microchannel was able to remove most of cell debris and all negatively charged proteins. The 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion protein (pI of 8.838; molecular mass of 57.15 kDa), which exhibits a positive charge in the buffer solution having the pH of 8.0 did not adsorb to the SPE. Of course, there were also some basic proteins that did not bind to the SPE. However, since the recombinant fusion protein was produced up to 60% of total E. coli proteins, most of the proteins out of the SPE were our desired target proteins. The partially purified sample so-lution after passing through the SPE was then flown into the gold-patterned microarray. For the detection of target protein by antigen-antibody interaction, the antibody RS solution was injected into the microarray onto which target proteins were attached. Also, a buffer solution was introduced for the comparison.",

            "text": "Since we designed our protein as a GBP-fusion protein, it can bind to gold surface. Electrochemical sensor experiment was carried out by using three gold electrodes integrated in the microfluidic channels (Fig. 5B) . For the accurate analysis of the IV curves, we replaced the gold microarray (micropattern) region shown in Fig. 1E with the three gold electrode module shown in Fig. 5B . The IV curves were examined to find oxidation and reduction potentials. The 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion protein solution (20 mL) was put on the working electrode. As shown in Fig. 5 , there was a shift of the peak (from black to red) by the interaction between the gold electrode and the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins. The oxidation and reduction potentials observed with bare gold electrode were about 110 and -75 mV, respectively. After the immobilization of GBP-fusion proteins, the oxidation and reduction potentials were shifted to about 350 and 2180 mV, respectively. After the addition of anti-SARS antibodies, the oxidation and reduction potentials were further shifted as shown in blue line, suggesting the interaction between the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins and anti-SARS antibodies. Thus, we were able to conclude that the electrochemical analysis monitoring the binding of GBP-fusion proteins on gold surface can be used for the studying molecular interactions in gold-patterned microfluidic channels. In this work, the electrochemical detection of SARS virus was successfully obtained from the whole cell within a total procedures time of about 20 min including 10 min for cell lysis, 0.5 min for SPE, and 8 min for IV.",

            "text": "After the successful demonstration of electrochemical detection of antigen-antibody interactions on the gold electrode, we examined the possibility of generating protein micropatterns through the binding of GBP-fusion proteins onto the micropatterned gold surface. After immobilization of the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins on the micropatterned gold surface of 50 mm-circle in diameter, the surface morphologies after binding of GBP-fusion protein and subsequent binding of antibodies on the gold chip were examined by AFM. As shown in Fig. 6A , the specific binding of 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion protein to the micropatterned gold surface was observed, which the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins formed a monolayer on the micropatterned gold surface. Ormo et al. [33] reported that GFP has a 4.2 nm long cylindrical structure with a molecular mass of ,27 kDa. The 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme has a molecular mass of ,57 kDa [33] . Thus, the length of 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion protein can be proportionally estimated to be ,8.87 nm. The line profile of the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins bound to the gold micropatterns was substantially measured as about 6.5 nm height differences from the gold substrate surface (Fig. 6B ). The height difference after binding with anti-SARS antibodies was about 9 nm, which again shows the specific interaction of antibodies with the monolayer of GBP-fusion proteins immobilized on the micropatterned gold surface (Fig. 6B) . Their interaction could also be observed by examining the topographic and phase mode surface morphologies, respectively (Figs. 6D and E). The phase detection was to obtain mechanical properties of the sample surface, especially for samples whose topography is best measured using noncontact AFM rather than contact AFM. Figures 6D and E show a topographic noncontact AFM image and a phase imaging of bare gold, 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion protein, and anti-SARS antibody, subsequently. The phase imaging provides complementary information to the topography image, revealing the variations in the surface properties of the binding biomolecules. We monitored three signals: topography, amplitude, and phase using noncontact mode of the XE-100 AFM. When the AFM cantilever approaches a sample, the amplitude decreases and the phase shift occurs relative to the oscillation signal in free space, as shown in Fig. 6E . The 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins and anti-SARS antibody, subsequently, were immobilized as an ordered monolayer showing a uniform thickness.",

As shown in Fig. 7 , the specific binding of the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins could be observed in sample 2, showing stronger spot intensities than the bare gold (sample 1). Subsequent binding of the anti-SARS antibody to the 6His-GBP-EGFP-SCVme fusion proteins bound to the gold micropatterns further increased the signal as shown in sample 3. These SPR images were captured at an incident angle that was lower than the SPR angle of the background surface as an inset image shown in Fig. 7A . The brighter spots indi-cate the binding of the target proteins on the gold micropatterns. These images show that the GBP-fusion protein binding to the gold micropatterns is highly specific.
