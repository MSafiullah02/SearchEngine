For example, government restrictions relating to recent travel to affected States made scheduling of operations and crew very difficult. \uf0b7 Some States denied flights permission to overfly and/or land for refuelling or transit, even when no passengers with Ebola were on board. This complicated the evacuation of individuals with other health issues (e.g. malaria and gastroenteritis). \uf0b7 Airline companies could not guarantee medical care in-country or via aeromedical evacuation for their crew and ground staff who developed non-Ebola health issues. \uf0b7 In certain cases, individuals who appeared ill during exit screening were quarantined in unhygienic conditions with Ebola patients. 23 Despite British Airways and Brussels Airlines apparently facing the same set of challenges, their responses diverged. British Airways suspended flights to West Africa and has yet to resume service as of January 2020. While an inability to ensure a safe working environment for its staff was noted as the main reason for flight suspension, interview respondents also identified other factors including staff anxiety, which was largely fuelled by media and social media reporting, and the business imperative: airlines are commercial entities that must protect their financial interests, which means suspending flights that are economically non-viable owing to reduced demand. One roundtable participant also highlighted the incongruence between the Ebola advisories coming from different public health authorities such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Public Health England, and WHO; this disconnect undermined confidence in the advisories and had a negative impact on staff.",

            "text": "At the outset of a health emergency, the public and other stakeholders often use the news media and increasingly social media for up-to-date information and guidance. The news media is particularly influential when the urgency of the public health situation is not matched by the speed at which authoritative information is provided from actors such as States or the WHO. 28 The IHR Review Committee noted critical limitations in WHO's capacity to provide timely, relevant, and evidence-based information to stakeholders to inform their decision-making during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, 23 thus requiring the public and other key stakeholders to turn to the news media to understand complex scientific information and develop advice on response measures. 29 In such a context, media coverage can sometimes be sensationalized or exaggerated rather than objective 29-31 and sometimes not entirely accurate. For example, a roundtable participant highlighted a news outlet describing Ebola as \u2017biological ISIS', whilst during the SARS outbreak, studies demonstrated that media reporting tended to create unwarranted fear and exaggerate the real risk of travelling to affected areas. 30, 32 Social media, such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook, increasingly provides new avenues for communication and information sharing. On the one hand, social media platforms are an important tool for disseminating accurate information, engaging the public, and dispelling rumours and misinformation shared during crises. 33 On the other hand, it provides an opportune platform for misinformation to spread rapidly. 34 Participants agreed that once an inaccurate message has been circulated through either news or social media, it is very difficult to counter. Encouragingly, at the time of writing, a number of social media companies are actively enforcing measures to combat the spread of misinformation regarding COVID-19 on their platforms. 35 A number of participants highlighted the importance of \u2017geo-specificity' during outbreak reporting, arguing that the media tend to focus on the entire State or region rather than the specific pockets affected. This lack of geo-specificity can lead travellers to perceive unaffected areas or even entire regions (e.g. Africa), as \u2017high-risk'. 33, 37, 36 The impact on the tourism sector is particularly high given its reliance on discretionary spending with tourists able to change their plans relatively easily in response to media coverage, 37 with widespread disruption of tourism across Africa during the West African Ebola outbreak. 38 Participants also postulated that sensational media reporting may have deterred aid workers travelling to West Africa and was a",

WHO is expected to release guidelines on the health and economic impacts of the different measures that States often impose in response to outbreaks in 2020 and it is hoped that such guidance will provide the evidence decision-makers need to refrain from implementing ineffective measures that interfere with travel. 42 Our study has limitations. Although our literature review attempted to be thorough, it was not systematic and may have missed some relevant studies. Those attending the roundtable were identified through existing networks of the authors, their colleagues at Chatham House and Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, and participants at earlier roundtables convened on the topics of monitoring 46 and the health and economic consequences of outbreaks. 4 Many invitees were unable to attend and funding limited the ability to host a number of roundtables or any outside of Europe. Regrettably, stakeholders from countries affected by the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak were not present, although most stakeholder industries were represented. The case studies were selected based on information gathered at the earlier roundtables, and are provided as heuristics rather than as a comprehensive dataset. Furthermore, this paper is published during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which is outside the scope of the original research.

The epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak may also inform hypotheses on the impact of travel restrictions on limiting or slowing the spread of a viral respiratory pathogen. Further work is also required to determine whether some of the successful risk mitigation processes (such as those employed by Brussels Airlines during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa) can be scaled up in future outbreaks, especially where the risk of spread via air travel is limited.
