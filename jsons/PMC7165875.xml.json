The authors identified key constructs of health\u2010care workers' (HCWs) risk perceptions within the organization. These were: personal health risks; health risk to others; social isolation; and acceptance of risks.\n6\n These constructs will now be discussed and where applicable, any data provided specifically on the perceptions of nurses will be highlighted.",
