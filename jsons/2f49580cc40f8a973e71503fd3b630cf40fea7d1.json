In comparison, only 4.7% of those who had never smoked developed critical outcomes. 11 Additionally, the proportion of patients with severe symptoms was 21.2% among current smokers and 42.9% among past smokers, which was higher compared with those who had never smoked (14.5%). 11 In this report, the analysis was just a simple comparison. Usually, past smokers were older than current smokers. Therefore, a high age in past smokers may contribute to their worsening outcomes.",

            "text": "A small study from China using multivariate analysis identified the following four factors as being associated with COVID-19 deterioration: smoking history, body temperature of >37.3\u00b0C at the time of admission, respiratory failure and age \u226560 years. 12 Among these, the OR for smoking history was highest at 14 (CI [1.6-45]; p=0.018), which was higher than the ORs for other factors associated with disease deterioration (8.5-9.0). As noted earlier, COVID-19 is considered to be severe and associated with a higher mortality rate in elderly patients with underlying diseases; it is worth noting that underlying diseases related to the severity of COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are all strongly associated with smoking. 13, 14 COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory tract, and virus entry into cells, viral replication and virion release occur within the respiratory tract. 15 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 converts the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to vasoprotective angiotensin. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Multiple studies have shown that ACE-2 is a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2. 16 SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through ACE-2 receptors present in mucosal epithelial cells and alveolar tissues in a clathrin-dependent process.",

In fact, the ECDC reported that 74% of COVID-19 fatalities in Italy had concomitant hypertension, suggesting an association with these drugs. 10 Many societies, including the European Society of Cardiology, have issued alerts that patients with cardiovascular diseases discontinue ACE inhibitors and angiotensinreceptor blockers. 20 Switching to calcium antagonists has been suggested; however, further evidence for this is needed. 21 Although only a few reports on smoking have been published to date and further accrual of evidence is warranted, smoking is likely to be an important and significant factor associated with COVID-19 severity.",

The detailed mechanism by which COVID-19 becomes more severe in patients with a history of cigarette smoking warrants further investigation. There is also a need for more evidence on the effect of second-hand smoke on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, according to published COVID-19 research reports, even at this stage, it might be well assumed that smokers are likely to be at serious risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function as early as 1 month. Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as part of public health measures to limit the global impact of COVID-19.",
