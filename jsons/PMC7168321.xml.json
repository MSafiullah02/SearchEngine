Knowledge of the pollination systems in Chamaedorea has relied on observations of flower visitors and floral morphology that tentatively assigned species to an entomophilous (insect) or anemophilous (wind) system (see references in Henderson 1986). Empirical studies on the pollination of Chamaedorea are relatively recent and only comprise around 6% of all the species. Results thus far have tended to categorise species as either entomophilus or anemophilous. Anemophily has been suggested for Chamaedorea pinnatifrons (Jacq.) \u00d8erst. (Listabarth 1993), Chamaedorea alternans H. Wendl. (Otero\u2010Arnaiz & Oyama 2001) and Chamaedorea radicalis Mart.

Listabarth (1993) proposed that the insect's activity facilitated the release of pollen from flowers where wind could more easily transport it to pistillate flowers, in a system he named \u2018insect\u2010induced wind pollination\u2019. Otero\u2010Arnaiz & Oyama (2001) also classified C. alternans as wind\u2010pollinated, however reported activity of thrips on staminate inflorescences. Conversely, Porter\u2010Morgan (2007) argued that thrips were the main pollinator of four Chamaedorea species and gave wind a secondary role. These authors, however, did not consider the possibility of a mixed pollination syndrome.",

Insects are probably attracted to the scented staminate flowers (Kirk 1985b) even before anthesis, where they mate and feed on pollen and plant tissue and oviposit within the small flowers. Most of the 52 Chamaedorea species analysed (96%) had scented staminate flowers. Consumption of vegetal tissue was more evident on staminate inflorescences, particularly in C. tepejilote; this consumption might be related to a low amount of anatomical defences. The increasing number of juvenile thrips found on drying staminate inflorescences indicates that immature insects develop on senescent flowers within a few days. Later, juvenile insects probably fall to the soil to complete their development (Lewis 1973). We found that thrips indeed transported pollen on their bodies, and volatile compounds (mainly sesquiterpenoids in C. tepejilote; Kaiser 1997) probably attract them to the pistillate flowers. Nonetheless, in our floral trait analysis only 31% of the species had scented pistillate flowers, which suggests that if thrips are the main pollinators of most of the analysed Chamaedorea, they also might locate pistillate flowers through visual cues.",

Pistillate flowers are morphologically similar to their staminate counterparts and imitate the oviposition substrate. However, they do not provide a brood site inside the small pistillate flowers with reduced perianth parts and lack pollen as food. Also, and although not studied here, septal nectaries to provide nectar as reward have not been detected in flowers of Chamaedorea (Askgaard et al. 2008). Pollination occurs when thrips arrive at pistillate flowers and do not stay for a long time, explaining the observed lower number of insects on pistillate inflorescence compared to staminate inflorescences. Before leaving, their activity on the inflorescence provides the opportunity for pollen to be deposited on the exposed stigmas and to develop the one\u2010seeded fruit. Alternatively, pistillate inflorescences might inhibit thrips oviposition or larval development due to a possible larger anatomical defences (Uhl & Moore 1973) or active inhibition of larval development (Dufa\u00ff & Anstett 2004).",

While thrips are occasionally mentioned as flower visitors, their potential role as palm pollinators has not been fully recognised (Kirk 1997; Barfod et al. 2011). Some previous pollination studies in Chamaedorea may have overlooked the importance of thrips. For instance, the supposedly anemophilous C. alternans (Otero\u2010Arnaiz & Oyama 2001) might also experience entomophily because the authors reported large amounts of thrips on staminate inflorescences. Listabarth (1993) suggested an indirect role of thrips in the pollination of C. pinnatifrons; however, our observations show that thrips have a direct role in pollen transport to pistillate flowers. The role of thrips as pollinators is documented in several plant groups with different taxonomic affinities, such as Zamiaceae (Mound & Terry 2001), Annonaceae (Gottsberger 1994; Momose et al. 1998), Dipterocarpaceae (Appanah & Chan 1981; Kondo et al. 2011), Euphorbiaceae (Fiala et al. 2011), Moraceae (Sakai 2001; Zerega et al. 2004) and Ericaceae (Hagerup & Hagerup 1953; Garc\u00eda\u2010Fayos & Goldarazena 2008).",

Initially, palms were considered anemophilous due to their floral morphology (i.e. small flowers, high pollen\u2013ovule ratio and small pollen grains), but this view has changed to consider palms as mainly entomophilous (Henderson 1986; Barfod et al. 2011); however, several studies have documented the role of insects and wind in palm pollination (Anderson et al. 1988; Scariot et al. 1991; Consiglio & Bourne 2001; Melendez\u2010Ramirez et al. 2004). Our pollination experiments showed that fruit set in the studied Chamaedorea species is the result of a mixed pollination system. In addition to thrips, Chamaedorea pollen grains can also be wind\u2010transported, as our pollen trapping experiment documented. Pollen release from the anthers in species with apically connate petals, such as C. pinnatifrons, might occur by spontaneous means and not necessarily need the intervention of thrips, as Listabarth (1993) suggested. Consequently, for species like C. tepejilote and C. costaricana with apically separated petals, pollen release into the wind is easily achieved without insect intervention. Pollen movement by wind in Chamaedorea can be a common phenomenon, even in the relatively low\u2010wind forest understorey, because the majority (85%) of the species selected for our analysis of floral traits possessed dry and powdery, easily wind\u2010transported pollen.",

Having a dual mixed pollination system is expected to increase the reproductive success of plants (Costa & Machado 2012) and therefore may represent a selective advantage. This enhanced success is particularly important for species in conditions where insect pollinators are scarce or species compete for pollinators (references in Culley et al. 2002). The effectiveness of both pollination systems in Chamaedorea is also likely to depend on floral traits that are adapted to both wind and insect pollination (Yamasaki & Sakai 2013) and very likely vary according to species, habitat and flowering season (Culley et al. 2002). In our study species, wind pollination significantly contributed to overall fruit set. We are however likely to underestimate the role of wind because the bag itself probably reduced somewhat the inflow of wind\u2010borne pollen (Kearns & Inouye 1993). In the ambophilous palm Attalea speciosa Mart. ex Spreng. (studied as Orbignya phalerata Mart.), anemophily was more important in open sites or pastures compared to forest conditions (Anderson et al. 1988). In Cocos nucifera L., ambophily is recognised but the relative importance of wind and insect as pollen vectors might depend on wind conditions (Melendez\u2010Ramirez et al. 2004). In Chamaedorea, ambophily may also contribute to long\u2010distance pollen dispersal because thrips dispersal might be limited (Kondo et al. 2011).",

However, C. macrospadix was placed by the cluster analysis in a group with floral characters adapted for anemophily, while our pollination experiments showed that insect pollination played an important role. In this species both staminate and pistillate flowers are scented, which may promote insect visitation. In addition, the flowering period of C. macrospadix in our study population comprises the second peak of the rainy season, which may constraint the role of wind pollination (data not shown).

This study aimed to increase knowledge about the pollination of this palm group, while trying to elucidate the existence of complex pollination mechanisms. Moreover, our results show a higher diversity in pollination mechanisms of Neotropical dioecious species than previously suggested by other authors (e.g. Bawa & Opler 1975; Renner & Ricklefs 1995).
