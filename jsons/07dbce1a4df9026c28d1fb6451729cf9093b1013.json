However, at present there is no satisfactory molecular theory which can be used to predict the interaction of two materials across their mutual interface. In a very informative and major detailed review, Peterson has pointed out that all existing theories of adhesion assume that a part of the molecular interactions involved obey the London inverse-sixth power lawwhich is valid for the separations involved in gases. 1 However, it has been shown that the London law is invalid both for the Casimir limit of large separations and for the close molecular contact that occurs in condensed phases2",

Following a review of the experimental data on molecular interactions, the Szkyskowski formalism was developed 3 and was shown to explain the temperature dependence previously observed by Vrbanac and Berg. 4 The most successful approach to describing the interfacial interactions of general materials is that of van Oss, Good and Chaudhury. s In their model, the interactions are considered to be London dispersion and undifferentiated Lewis acid-base interactions. This approach has been shown to be valid under various simplifying assumptions. However, in order to develop it as a theory providing significant predictive power, Peterson proposed that it must be modified in three aspects. 1 These are, firstly, that an additional parameter is required, and then the theory must be modified by using non-linearity, and bya separate consideration of entropic terms.",

Polymer coatings pigmented with carbon black, phthalocyanine blue, a yellow organic azo pigment and red oxide were studied. ~1 The first period of water evaporation led to the greatest rate of colour change. The lightness decreased and the chroma increased, especially with the chromatic, lower-density carbon black, phthalocyanine blue and yellow organic azo pigments, which migrate closer to the coating surface as the water evaporates. Pigment particle migration was also influenced by pigment-pigment and pigment-polymer interaction.",

The authors argue that as industrial competition places increasingly stringent demands on print quality and operation speed, fundamental research into the underlying fluid mechanics of liquid printing is essential, because computational approaches may obviate the necessity for empirical and exhaustive experimentation.~S The Lagrangian finite element method enables the fluid flow to consist of fluid particles which are given labels so that natural tracking of moving free surfaces by the connected mesh is possible and moving solid boundaries/obstacles present no special problems. Further details of the Lagrangian methodology and the specific algorithm used have been published. 68 This computational approach is very accurate provided that a suitable mesh can be generated. However, if the free surface deformation is very corn plex and involves liquid rupture, then the creation of a suitably robust computational mesh can become extremely difficult. Alternatively, a fully automatic mesh generation scheme may be devised, a difficult computational task, or the Eulerian volume of fluid method can be employed. 6s",

A cell with an F value between zero and one contains a free surface. Regions of fluid are tracked through a fixed (Eulerian) mesh rather than the mesh deforming to track the fluid, as in the Lagrangian method. Thus all meshing and logic problems associated with the interface breakup are removed. This enables complicated free boundary configurations to be simulated. However, the VOF method does not exhibit a very high degree of accuracy on small scales because of the use of a fixed mesh. In addition, the authors assert that there is no obvious way of incorporating moving rigid boundaries and obstacles into the algorithm. ~s The recently developed 'frictional area volume obstacle representation' (FAVOR) algorithms may, however, yield a possible solution to this problem. 69 Powell algorithm to simulate printing a liquid from a trapezoidal cavity, and the VOF method to simulate printing with a pintool. 6s Computational approaches to practical cases such as the effect of imperfect cell filling in gravure printing and problems generated by gravity and rotation-driven instabilities are also discussed in detail.
