Alterations of microbiome composition are linked to lifestyle changes, short- and long-term diet [1], probiotics intake [1,2], medications including antibiotics [3] and diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes [4], colorectal cancer [5], Crohn's disease [6] and others. Based on the discovered associations, a number of microbial taxa have been proposed as potential biomarkers. For example, the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium is inversely associated with body fat mass and glucose intolerance [7]. Disrupted gut community structure is also one of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases [8]. Many of the bacteria belonging to Clostridiales order are efficient producers of butyrate an other short-chain fatty acids known to possess anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and other important activities including gut epithelium integrity maintainence [9,10].",

Human gut-specific PCR panels have been described before. One of them describes a qPCR test for detecting 4 taxa using SYBR Green: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Enterococcus spp. [15]. In a more extensive manner, a real-time quantitative PCR-based analysis platform termed 'GUt Low-Density Array' (GULDA) with SYBR Green for 27 bacterial taxa was introduced [16]. Detailed clade-focused applications are available - for example, for detecting all known species of human gut-dwelling bifidobacteria [17] using genus- and species-specific primers and probes for qPCR and further proceeding with PCR product restriction for species identification.",

To address this issue, the set could be extended by adding a universal pair of primers (and a probe) targeting total prokaryotic content that can be used for normalization purposes (for example, by dividing signals from other taxa by it). Although this would reflect the microbial concentration in the analyzed DNA sample, this concentration could not directly correspond to the concentration in the subject's stool, as it can change considerably during the extraction. One of the suggested ways to approach absolute normalization is to collect an exactly equal volume of stool each time. Still, our platform allows us to assess the pairwise ratios between the targeted taxa. Consideration of ratios in the context of microbiome data is especially relevant as for many techniques - including metagenomics - they are often inherently compositional implying use of statistical approaches based on ratios, for instance, the balances [60]. The ratios and their derivatives can further be used as microbial community features to explore the associations with clinical status, diet and other factors. Finally, the proposed platform can be used for prioritization purposes: basing on its results for a specific subject, one can opt for performing additional in-depth analysis using other qPCR platforms targeting microbial genes (like virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants) or pathogenic taxa.",

Positive correlation with the data obtained using a different method demonstrates that the qPCR method can be applied for larger cohorts during the clinical and observational studies related to diet and diseases. Further larger clinical trials are needed to identify the method specificity and accuracy when it comes to individual microbiome analysis.",
