This genetic heterogeneity may in turn reflect the aetiological role of different environmental agents, specific differences in the pathogenesis nevertheless leading to clinically indistinguishable diseases. It is probable that other genes interact with those encoded in the major histocompatibility complex in determining susceptibility to MS but at present the closest identified markers are the HLA-DR antigens themselves.",

But since genetic and environmental factors probably interact in the development of the disease, failure to compare MS patients with HLA matched controls may have obscured patterns of viral exposure which are only significant for the pathogenesis in individuals with the MS associated HLA-DR phenotypes. The existing studies cannot distinguish between clinical and serological abnormalities specific to MS and those which can merely be explained by an effect of HLA-DR type itself. In this study we have compared exposure to many organisms, some previously implicated in the pathogenesis of MS, in patients with optic neuritis, isolated demyelinating lesions, clinically definite MS or other neurological diseases and normal controls preselected to match the abnormal distribution of HLA-DR antigens found in individuals with demyehnation.",

The diagnosis of an isolated demyelinating lesion was made in patients with rapid onset of symptoms and signs referable to the brainstem or spinal cord, alone or in combination with cerebral and optic nerve disease, in whom investigations were consistent with demyelination. Patients with clinically definite (CD) MS were judged to be in relapse after developing one or more new, or a worsening of existing, symptoms lasting more than 24 h.

Details of previous immunization against poliomyelitis, typhoid fever, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, smallpox and tuberculosis were also obtained as was the estimated frequency and duration of contact with domestic animals; demographic and personal details were recorded. In some instances an estimate within various age limits was used to record age of infection. When necessary, relatives and general practitioners were contacted by the subject or interviewer to supplement the participants' replies, but this did not yield much additional information.

Most of the results presented in the tables relate to these continuous variables, such as age of infection or antibody titres. Since the methods used to analyse the results are not easily illustrated we have tabulated these data as relative risks for developing demyelination in three arbitrarily defined categories attempting to provide approximately equal numbers in each; individuals in whom antibody was not detected or there was no history of infection provide a fourth group of cases and controls. The P values quoted in the text and tables relate to the X 2 , Kruskal Wallis or Mann-Whitney tests and not these relative risks, although each is derived from the same observations. The analysis of age of infection is based only on those reporting a particular illness since in most instances, serological tests showed that individuals without this history had been exposed at some unknown time; relative risks have, nevertheless, been calculated for this group.",

Currier and Eldridge (1982) showed an association between age of childhood infections and age at onset of symptoms due to MS in twins, one in each pair of which was already known to have the disease, but age of infection did not influence concordance for the disease.

In making multiple comparison it is likely that associations will occur by chance and after applying stringent statistical corrections for this possibility, none of our findings remains significant. Also there are likely to be considerable reporting errors in a retrospective assessment of childhood illnesses, even when the patients' recollections are supplemented by parental information or records of general practitioners. Patients with MS may be better motivated to recall accurately the occurrence and timing of childhood infections than unaffected controls, and methodological factors in a retrospective study could lead to spurious differences in estimating ages of infection. Although a validity survey carried out by Haile et al. (1982) identified inaccuracies in the reported age of childhood infections, Alter and Cendrowski (1976) and Haile et al. (1982) concluded that the direction and degree of inaccuracy did not differ between cases and controls and had not influenced their results. But we would not regard a particular age as critical for susceptibility to MS and would attach no significance to our findings in the assessment of individual patients. Our method of selecting controls identified large numbers of unrelated individuals, living in the same area as our patients and exposed to the same general environmental conditions, but the method will have selected some controls who had close working contact with each other and this may have influenced the serological findings. Interactions between measles antibody, HLA type and sex have been reported (Fewster et al., 1977) , but in many instances the bias in favour of females in our patient population has tended to underestimate the differences between cases and controls. Because of the nature of their symptoms and the referral pattern to our clinics, cases with optic neuritis were studied earlier and often found to have higher antibody titres than those in the other disease categories, perhaps reflecting more recent environmental events and anamnestic responses, but we have no information on serial changes or those related to disease activity.",

T suppressor cells influence B lymphocyte responses to many antigens and although there is evidence for reduced T suppressor numbers (Compston, 1983; Hauser et al., 1983) and function (Antel et al., 1979; Tjernlund et al., 1984) in patients with MS, B cell overactivity in peripheral blood cannot be explained only by postulating a defect in T-B suppressor activity; reconstituting T and B cells from normal controls and MS patients in all combinations shows that B cell function in patients with MS is independent of T cell control (Goust et al., 1982) ; whatever the immunological explanation for these results, the possibility exists that virus infection itself stimulates these persistent B lymphocyte abnormalities.",

The results, showing that age of infection and antibody titres differ between cases and HLA matched controls, with no difference between all individuals depending on HLA-DR type, indicate that patterns of immune reactivity in patients with demyelination are not merely a consequence of the increased frequency of DR2. Therefore, age at infection, enhanced or persistent antibody responses and presence of specific HLA antigens are probably independent factors associated with an increased risk of MS, but each may be involved in the sequence of events leading to demyelination.",

HLA phenotype studies have provided supportive laboratory evidence, identified a small area on the sixth human chromosome as uniquely important in determining susceptibility to the disease, confirmed the probable importance of polygenic inheritance and provided evidence for heterogeneity in the pathogenesis. Attempts to identify HLAlinked immunological abnormalities by which to explain the mechanism of these associations have not been successful and we do not think that this approach, using phenotypic markers, will provide further insight into the disease. But HLA phenotype studies have prepared the way for more detailed comparisons between unrelated individuals with MS, or within multiplex MS families, using recombinant DNA techniques with gene probes for the major histocompatibility complex; it is already clear that detection of restriction fragment length polymorphisms can reveal HLA-D region typing differences between HLA identical individuals, defined by serological or cellular techniques (Cohen et al., 1984) .",
