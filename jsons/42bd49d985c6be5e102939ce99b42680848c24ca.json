The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted from person to person, principally through respiratory droplets or contact (2) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are possibly transmitted through the fecal-oral route (3, 4) , suggesting similar transmission of the COVID-19 virus. We report a case of COVID-19 with a positive result of virus nucleic acid in a fecal specimen and negative results on multiple pharyngeal and sputum samples.",

On January 24, she had respiratory symptoms and fever (39.6\u00b0C). Outpatient and inpatient symptomatic treatments were ineffective, and she was hospitalized at our facility on February 3. Laboratory tests revealed a leukocyte count of 6.2 3 10 9 /L (normal, 3.9-9.9), a lymphocyte count of 0.9 3 10 9 /L (normal, 1.1-3.2), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 27 mm/hr (normal, 0-20), and a serum amyloid A of 110.4 mg/L (normal, 0-10). Chest computed tomography revealed \"ground-glass\" pulmonary opacities bilaterally. The SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test on a pharyngeal swab sample was negative. The following day, the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test on a fecal sample was positive. During 7 days after admission, the test was negative on 2 more pharyngeal swab samples and 2 sputum samples. After anti-infective and antiviral treatment, her fever disappeared and symptoms and computed tomography abnormalities improved, allowing hospital discharge. Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection routes is still limited. This case indicates that the virus can proliferate in the digestive tract and potentially undergo fecal-oral transmission.
