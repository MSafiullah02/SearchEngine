Interestingly, COVID-19 patients were not observed to present with lung cavitations, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, or lymphadenopathy [6]. Finally, COVID-19 patients undergoing autopsy showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7].",

In order to more fully understand ARDS, it is important to consider how the lungs function. As one breathes, air is taken in through the nose and mouth and passes down the windpipe into alveoli within the lungs. It is in the capillaries that run through the alveoli that oxygen passes into the blood stream and is carried to all parts of the body. In ARDS, the capillaries within the lungs leak more fluid than normal into the alveoli and prevent the lungs from delivering enough oxygen into the blood stream. The consequence is that the body's organs work poorly or not at all. Fig. 1\nsummarizes the delivery of hemoglobin-based oxygen molecules to peripheral tissues in a normal patient's capillary and in a COVID-19 patient's capillary [14].",

At sea level the blood (plasma) oxygen concentration is 0.3 mL per deciliter [18], [19]. Tissues at rest extract 5 to 6 mL of oxygen per deciliter of blood, assuming normal perfusion [18], [20]. Administering 100 percent oxygen at ambient pressure increases the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood 5-fold to 1.5 mL per deciliter, and at 3 atmospheres, the dissolved-oxygen content is approximately 6 mL per deciliter.

Among patients not diagnosed with COVID-19, it was previously estimated that about 40% of all patients admitted to the ICU receive pRBC transfusions (with a mean of 5 units per patient) [27].

ESAs given by injection were observed to significantly increase the numbers of RBCs with increased tissue perfusion and oxygenation over several weeks [30]. In addition, given the ability of ESAs to increase RBC synthesis, it was observed that the supply of iron may not be able to keep pace with RBC synthesis, and, hence, it may be necessary to provide iron supplementation [31].",

Namely, it was revealed that CQ and HCQ have the ability to significantly increase cellular hemoglobin production [35] and it was suggested that such drugs may have a therapeutic potential to raise hemoglobin levels in patients [36]. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials revealed that HCQ treatment among patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus significantly reduced their levels of hemoglobin A1c (glycated hemoglobin decreases the oxygen carrying capacity and limits oxygen tissue delivery) [37].

Acetazolamide inhibits the re-absorption of these ions, and hence, by increasing the blood level of bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic. This results in a compensatory hyperventilation (Kussmaul respiration) with increased blood oxygen levels and decreased blood carbon dioxide levels [38].

A significant percentage of the mortality associated with COVID-19 is related to respiratory conditions. At present, respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments for respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite such treatments of COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions, a high mortality rate is still being observed. It is hypothesized that there are underlying pathological changes among COVID-19 patients that are compatible with ARDS. A series of alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinical available treatments such as HBOT, pRBC transfusions, or ESAs were hypothesized to deliver increased oxygen to peripheral tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator support therapeutic treatments. Fig. 2\nprovides an overview of the mechanism of action for the various novel treatment strategies for respiratory conditions in COVID-19 patients. It is recommend, given such alternative therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions. It is also recommend that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.",
