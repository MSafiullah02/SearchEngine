Depending on institutional practices, some minor procedures were performed in theatre or by the bedside. Therefore, cranial procedures such as external ventricular drain insertion, wound washouts and intracranial pressure monitoring although documented, were recorded as not being a surgical procedure. Similarly, image guided injections were inconsistently performed by neurosurgeons at some centres and interventional radiologists at others and were therefore not recorded as surgical procedures. An MRI under general anaesthetic and diagnostic digital subtraction angiograms were also not recorded as surgical procedures. Data was also collected for the number of COVID-19 positive patients during the same time period.",

Moreover, to account for bias from confounders, demographic data including age and gender was collected. Descriptive analysis was performed using histograms, point-plots and bar-plots to study trends. Inferential analysis was performed using Welch two sample t test to examine difference in means of continuous variables and Pearson's chi-squared test for categorical variables to determine if the observed distribution was due to chance. The Pearson's chi-squared test demonstrated a p-value <0.05, therefore rejecting the null hypothesis that urgency of presentation (X-squared=14.9, df=2), site (X-squared=17.3, df=4) and aetiology (X-squared=38.0, df=14) are independent of the timing of admission. Although the decrease in elective presentations was planned and therefore anticipated, there was also a decrease in the number of emergency presentations as demonstrated in Fig 5 and Fig 6.

Whilst the decline in emergency presentations (X-squared=21.3, df=14, p-value 0.09) could be attributed to the decrease in trauma presentations, there was also a decrease in the number of vascular presentations that could be clinically significant.",

Despite attempting strict individual isolation and daily testing, five of the nine individuals were subsequently tested positive with varying severity of symptomology. On the 29 th of Jan, the Queensland government declared a public health emergency. The Federal Government banned gatherings of more than 500 people and advised against non-essential overseas travel on the 12 th of Mar, 2020 with the first reported death in the state the day after. All individuals returning from overseas travel were imposed a 14-day isolation period. The testing criteria was sequentially broadened from a positive travel history to Wuhan, to any overseas travel history, to health care workers with respiratory symptoms and eventually anyone with respiratory symptoms. Contact tracing became a pivotal tool in the armamentarium of the Public Health Unit to understand how the virus was spreading in the community. The COVID SAFE App, approved by the Australian government with contact information being deleted on a 21-day rolling cycle, was rolled out on the 26 th of April to fast track contact tracing.",

This was followed by a state government response to shut down state borders and to transition schools to an electronic mode of curriculum delivery with the exception of children of essential service personnel. On the 30 th of March, the Queensland government further tightened social distancing restrictions with ban to travel outside the home except for essential reasons and strict policing to ensure compliance. From initial modelling that suggested 30,000 Queenslanders would die from COVID-19 if not contained, these drastic measures produced a significant flattening of the curve within a month. Towards the end of April, with a growth factor of 0.88, the government commenced a gradual relaxation of the stringent travel restrictions whilst encouraging social distancing. Emergence of a second wave would likely see the re-establishment of more stringent restrictions.",

This was anticipated to increase capacity of emergency care and limit non-essential physical contact to manage the risk to patients and staff 4 . Endoscopic endonasal skull base procedures were postponed if patients were clinically stable, given the high likelihood of aerosolizing virions within the nasal sinuses and infecting the entire operating room staff despite laminar flow 3 . In the setting of clinical deterioration, the general practice was then to consider a craniotomy. COVID-19 theatres were also established for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to minimize cross-contamination. While staff received training in the use of COVID-19 specific personnel protective equipment and workflow, this did not require implementation as no COVID-19 positive or suspected patients warranted a neurosurgical procedure. If deemed clinically appropriate, the anaesthetic and pre-admission reviews were conducted via videoconference by appropriately qualified clinicians using the Queensland Health Telehealth Portal.",

All departmental meetings, multi-disciplinary meetings and educational sessions were also continued using video conferencing that facilitated remote and thus safe participation. Interhospital transfer of neurosurgical patients presenting to peripheral hospital had to be endorsed by hospital's senior staff management. Visitations were strictly limited to one per person per day and for patients in isolation, visitors were discouraged from attending at all. Neurosurgical staff were split into two teams, two weeks on clinical duties and two weeks on administrative duties, to ensure continued safe provision of neurosurgical service. Given the successful flattening of the curve, neurosurgical staff members did not require redeployment to COVID-19 wards or fever clinics. Administrative staff members were encouraged to work from home when possible. Towards the end of April, with the relaxation of travel restrictions, the government has proposed a staged reintroduction of semi-urgent and non-urgent elective surgery.",

            "text": "An examination of the bar-plots, demonstrate an obvious reduction in the number of presentations during the COVID-19 response. As mandated by government policy, there was a planned reduction in the number of elective admissions and surgeries, particular degenerative spine, benign neoplastic lesions and vascular pathologies. However, a surprising trend that was not statistically significant, demonstrating a decrease in emergency presentations was also noted. Although, this could be explained by the reduction in trauma from the strict travel restrictions imposed by the government, there was an obvious reduction in the number of emergency vascular presentations, particularly subarachnoid haemorrhage. Despite the decreased emergency presentations of SAH, those that did present were higher grades with higher mortality. Whilst contrary to current literature demonstrating the increased incidence of SAH during cold temperatures and influenza epidemics, the noted trend could be explained by the general public's fear of presenting to the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic 5 . However, fear alone might not fully explain this trend as there were similar if not slightly increased emergency presentations for shunt dysfunction and oncology during the same period. Another postulation might be the stringent social distancing laws and travel bans that meant a vulnerable segment of the population may not have received timely attention from a good Samaritan. Therefore, larger, multicentre studies across the globe are required to fully comprehend the impact of the numerous, varying public health policies on COVID-19 and health care delivery This study has several limitations. First, the study could be subject to a sampling bias as other states such as Victoria and New South Wales have a larger migrant population compared to Queensland. Moreover, the data collected does not incorporate a minority of the population who sought private neurosurgical care and some spinal presentations managed by the orthopaedic service. However, it is worth noting that the Queensland data was comparable to the national averages. Second, the study could be subject to confounders. As this study was designed to examine the epidemiological trends in neurosurgical presentations during the COVID-19 rather than specifically subarachnoid haemorrhage, known confounders such as ethnicity, history of subarachnoid haemorrhage or hypertension and aneurysmal characteristics such as site and size, were not documented 6 . For these reasons, the external validity of the study needs to be cautiously interpreted. Larger studies examining the impact of the various public health policies implemented around the globe on health outcomes would shed further light on those that made the most difference. Moreover, larger studies examining emergency vascular presentations including subarachnoid haemorrhage during a viral pandemic could shed further light on a causal rather than an associational inference, if one exists.",

            "text": "tertiary neurosurgical centres, four adults and one paediatric, service the entire Queensland population of 5.07 million. These five centres are staffed by 29 neurosurgeons, of varying durations of commitment, and 25 full time neurosurgical trainees, both accredited and unaccredited. 1298 neurosurgical (542 Elective and 757 Emergency) admissions were recorded over the three months, none of whom were tested COVID-19 positive. While 535 patients were managed conservatively, 763 patients underwent surgical intervention. During this period, 116,479 tests for COVID-19 was performed in Queensland with 1032 confirmed cases as demonstrated in Fig 1 and six recorded deaths. Of these 980 patients have recovered, with only 9 current hospitalisations and 4 intensive care unit admissions. Queensland performed 22,600 tests per one million population similar to the national average of 23,900 tests per one million. Contact tracing demonstrated that the vast majority of confirmed cases were acquired from overseas travel (799) or acquired locally through close contact with a known confirmed case (174) with relatively small numbers of community transmission (44). Inferential Analysis: The mean age of neurosurgical admissions in February was 51.0 years (95% CI 49.1-53.0, p<0.05), in March 48.5 years (95% CI 46.6-50.4, p<0.05) and April 49.6 years (95% CI 47.0-52.1, p<0.05).The Welch two-sample t-test did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in mean ages during these three months. However, the histogram inFig 2 demonstratesa flattening of the age distribution in April due to reduced number of patients between 50-80 years of age. The point-plot(Fig 3)and bar-plots demonstrate an obvious decline in the number of neurosurgical presentations in April,2020. Despite the decline in presentations, the slight preponderance for males (X-squared=0.8, df=2, p-value=0.68) was preserved as demonstrated inFig 4.",
