Risk factors for death were analyzed. Results: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. Conclusions: A period of 7-13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.",

Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the SARS virus, but in a different clade [2] . SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, suggesting that bats are the primary source [3, 4] . Epidemiologic investigations of initial cases showed COVID-19 was linked with exposure to the Wuhan seafood market which also sold live rabbits, snakes, and other animals [5] . Subsequently, human-to-human transmission among close contacts has been the primary mechanism of transmission [6] . The disease has spread rapidly around the world, and more than 410,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported. COVID-19 outbreak has been reported in other countries, mainly among travelers from Wuhan and their contacts [7, 8] . WHO has declared this disease a pandemic.",

The principal presenting features of COVID-19 are fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [10, 11] . Approximately 20% of patients progress to multi-organ dysfunction (including respiratory failure, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, or acute renal failure [10] [11] [12] . However, a complete picture of the clinical course of COVID-19 has not been described thoroughly [13] . Except for infection control and supportive therapy, there is no specific therapy of COVID-19. Multiple organ support therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 [12, 13] . Early recognition of risk factors for death would be useful to identify those potentially needing critical care at an early stage. Accordingly, a study was conducted to track the clinical course along the entire disease course. A risk factor analysis was performed to reveal important clinical features associated with poor outcomes.",

Xishui People's Hospital is located in Huanggang city, another early endemic center of COVID-19 in Hubei province. In total, about 340 heath care workers provided care to COVID-19 patients in the two medical centers from January to February 2020. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance [14] . The methodology of RT-PCR used has been previously reported [12] .

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition [16] . Cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin I) were above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit or if new abnormalities were shown in echocardiography.

Ninety (84.1%) patients showed multi-lobar involvement on initial radiographs. One hundred five (98.1%) patients showed bilateral involvement on chest CT scan during hospitalization. Compared with survivors, on admission, non-survivors had higher neutrophil counts (5.4 \u00d7 10 9 /L [3.2-8.5] vs 2.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L [2-3.9], P < 0.001), lower platelet count (122 \u00d7 10 9 /L [83-178] vs 178 [139-207], P = 0.006), and higher D-dimer level (439 mg/L vs 191 mg/L [108-327], P = 0.003).

Dynamic body temperature and laboratory findings in 107 COVID-19 patients are shown in supplementary Fig. 1 . During the first week after symptom onset, fever was prominent and more severe in the non-survivors. Body temperature gradually normalized in the second week. In general, white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts were in normal range during week 1, with leukocytosis and neutrophilia as later findings. Lymphopenia was common throughout the disease's course, and the lymphocyte count dropped more in non-survivors. Platelet counts decreased slightly in the first week, then rose back to normal range rapidly in survivors, but remained low in non-survivors. Mild prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) during the illness course was observed, with no difference between survivors and nonsurvivors. The D-dimer level was elevated in the nonsurvivors during the late stage of illness. In the early stage of the illness, higher levels of creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were observed in the nonsurvivors than in the survivors.

We also analyzed the prognosis factors and found that age and male gender were the independent risk factor for mortality. This study showed the clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, and other systemic symptoms. Most positive NAAT results could be obtained in week 1, which suggested that the symptoms were largely related to the effect of viral replication. In surviving patients, laboratory abnormalities included lymphopenia and prolonged prothrombin time. In non-survivors, the emergence of systemic inflammation was evidenced by higher fever, respiratory rate, WBC counts, and neutrophil counts. Subsequently, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurred with thrombocytopenia, renal failure, acute myocardial injury, and ARDS. Notably, there was an obvious drop in body temperature around day 7, probably in relation to the widespread use of methylprednisolone as a rescue therapy.",

Organ support therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir, a novel nucleotide analog antiviral drug, has been used in the first case with COVID-19 in the USA, and a clinical trial of remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 infection is in progress [21] . Remdesivir and chloroquine have been shown to effectively inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells [22] . In hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care [23] . Moreover, the effects of abidol, oseltamivir, or methylprednisolone in SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been fully evaluated.",
