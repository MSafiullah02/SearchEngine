High suspicion for early detection and quick withdrawal of the culprit medication are the most important steps in stopping this reaction. Aggressive supportive care is often necessary as the patient recovers. Steroids, other immunosuppressants, and plasmapheresis have all been studied as treatments, but high-quality evidence supporting their contributions, either together or separately, in decreasing length of hospital stay or prolonging survival have not been consistently demonstrated.

This is likely due in part to the increased likelihood of HIV patients being exposed to potential culprit medications such as sulfonamides, but other cases are attributable to the HIV infection itself. Other viruses that may play a role in the pathogenesis of SJS and TEN include enterovirus, adenovirus, measles, mumps, CMV [29] , herpes simplex, HHV-6, and influenza [59] . HHV has been recognized as a causative agent for SJS and TEN for several cases in children in particular. Some viral infections have been shown to increase expression of Fas ligand or sensitivity to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis [29] , but the importance of Fas ligand expression may have been overestimated, both overall and in virally induced cases of SJS and TEN. Speculation exists that changes to immune cell activity in keratinocytes induced by infection contributes to development of SJS and TEN in these cases.",

Diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (but not hematologic malignancy, lung cancer, or urothelial carcinoma), abnormal labs, and recent or current chemotherapy administration were associated with higher risks of death in a recent review of patients in the UK [68] . A study of patients in the USA found that SJS and TEN were most associated with multiple myeloma, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and CNS malignancies [25] .

A favored theory regarding T-cell activation is termed the prohapten concept. A medication or its metabolite can bind with host protein to form a novel antigen. This antigen is taken up by APCs, which process the protein and then display the resulting peptides on the HLA component of their MHC for presentation to TCRs on CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. Upon binding of the HLA-novel antigen on the APC to the TCR of the CD4 or CD8+ T cell, the T lymphocyte is induced to replicate and these T cells will target host tissues [31] . Another model is termed the pharmacologic interaction of drugs with the immune system (p-i) concept. In this model, medications or their metabolites noncovalently bond with the type I MHC and TCR, which sets off production of T cells only. This theory could explain the lack of significant B cell populations found in the skin of patients studied with SJS and TEN.",

However, in many of these cases, it can be challenging to determine if SJS and TEN is occurring in response to the infection or malignancy itself or in response to its treatment.

Reviews of plasmapheresis used in conjunction with pulse dose steroids have concluded that this combination could result in lower mortality rates or improved time to recovery [70] . Some case series suggested beneficial responses for patients refractory to other therapies [60] . In other case series, patients failed to exhibit any benefit from the use of plasmapheresis [17] . Plasmapheresis has been covered by insurance in Japan since 2006 as a second-line therapy for TEN [69] .

A prospective, randomized controlled study comparing the use of thalidomide to placebo in patients with TEN who had not received any therapy closed early after enrolling 22 of the planned 50 patients when 13 of the 22 patients died over the 16 months enrollment had been open. Upon unblinding of the results, it was found that 10 patients out of 12 had died in the thalidomide group, and 3 people out of 10 had died in the placebo group.

Pulmonary complications occur in approximately 15% of cases. Multisystem organ failure is noted in at least 30% of patients with SJS and TEN [45] . Purported cause does not play a role in risk of mortality. The SCORTEN scale allows for estimation of risk of death. Each of the following prognostic factors in the SCORTEN scoring system is worth one point: age greater than 40 years old, heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute, presence of malignancy, BSA greater than 10% involved, serum urea greater than 10 mM, serum bicarbonate less than 20 mM, and serum glucose greater than 14 mM. A score of 0-1 is associated with a mortality rate of 3.2%, 2 with 12.1%, 3 with 35.8%, 4 with 58.3%, and 5 or greater with 90% mortality [10] . Serum bicarbonate less than 20 mM indicates pulmonary involvement and also portends poor prognosis. GI involvement also indicates elevated morbidity and mortality should be anticipated [5] .",
