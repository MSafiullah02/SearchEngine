In this context, World Health Organization (WHO) was urging the international community to perform massive diagnostic testing to fight transmission of the virus and decrease number of undetected cases, since testing is also a valuable tool, aiding researchers to learn the epidemiology of the disease. Moreover, diagnostics play a decisive role in making timely decisions on treatment and isolation of infected people, thereby, slowing or stopping the spread of the infectious diseases.",

            "text": "PCR involves amplification of minute traces of genetic material; i.e., the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the virus, leading to highly specific and sensitive detection. However, PCR tests are generally performed in centralized diagnostic services by highly skilled personnel and their results may take from 4 h up to 3 days. Apart from this, PCR tests are prone to the following limiting factors: (i) Sampling error: Nasopharyngeal swab is suitably performed to take mucus from the ventilatory system; however, this may give rise to false negatives as optimal sampling moment is still ambiguous. (ii) Besides, as a sample preparation (including cell lysis and nucleic acid purification) for PCR analysis is required, not only the number of the tests but also the number of extraction kits is a limiting factor for ramping up COVID-19 testing. (\u201cShortage of RNA extraction kits hampers efforts to ramp up COVID-19 coronavirus testing,\u201d 2020) (iii) Generally, PCR samples require specialized handling and transportation. Genetic material may be denatured during inadequate transportation, bringing also about false negatives. (iv) Quality of reagents utilized by different PCR kit manufacturers may also affect consistency among results. (v) Standard PCR methods may lack of sensitivity, potentially giving rise to false negative results in COVID-19 patients with unapparent clinical symptoms. For patients in recovery, this resulted in the heatedly debated issue with the \u201cre-infection\u201d, or more accurately \u201cre-detectable positive\u201d patients, as confirming tests with more-sensitive methods delivered again positive results (An et al., 2020). (vi) Because of the nucleic acid amplification employed, special primers and probes for each target are necessary which limits PCR's flexibility of scaling up for other nucleic acids in an easy and rapid manner. (vii) This previous point could even be a problem for the same target since SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to undergo mutations (KupferschmidtMar, 2020). Therefore, sequencing of genetic material of the virus should be continuously monitored and confirmed to ensure accuracy of this method. In this regard, other biosensing technologies offer a complementary approach to standard PCR-based tests not only in terms of sensitivity, but also in terms of diagnostics and therapeutic decisions. Moreover, the biosensing community is actively working to improve portability, time and cost of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection (Nunez-Bajo et al., 2020) as well as to create easy-to-use PCR-based microfluidic devices with an integrated sample preparation (\u201cState funds the development of rapid tests for coronavirus,\u201d 2020). Interestingly, an international company envisions an alternative approach by detecting COVID-19 within the exhaled breath condensate using the combination of PCR and LFA technology since it is an airborne droplet infection (\u201cThe detection of COVID-19 on the breath followed by PCR, 2020\u201d. In contrast to PCR, isothermal amplification of genetic material (at constant temperature) enables to develop point-of-care devices for the rapid detection of nucleic acids. A remarkable example of an approved technology for COVID-19 determination is shown by the company Abbott, which delivers results in around 13 min (\u201cAbbott Launches Molecular Point-of-Care Test to Detect Novel Coronavirus in as Little as Five Minutes - Mar 27, 2020\u201d).",

Importantly, these immunoglobulins are not only valuable to detect COVID-19, but also for its potential therapy (Chen et al., 2020).

Besides, CRISPR-Biosensor's group would like to target two characteristic genome sequences (E gene and RdRP gene) of SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, using a multiplexed microfluidic chip. In principle, CRISPR-powered approaches allow for an easy adaptation to any nucleic acids and thus, can address potential mutations of SARS-CoV-2 in a timely manner. As another nucleic acid amplification-free approach, an optical biosensor combining plasmonic photothermal effect and localized surface plasmon resonance has been recently demonstrated to discriminate similar gene sequences with high analytical sensitivity (Qiu et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Another convenient way of sensing is the use of substrates (i.e. sensor material) functionalized with recombinant viral antigens which can be exploited to bind the aforementioned immunoglobulins. With this, it is possible to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus (via IgM) or to provide a history of past infections (via IgG) as these antibodies are much longer present in the blood (VogelMar. 19, G, 2020). In this regard, LFAs, well-known as at-home pregnancy and ovulation tests, offer an equipment free, user-friendly and rapid platform for optical on-site testing and are the masterpiece of biosensing and nanotechnology, so far (Marquez and Morales-Narv\u00e1ez, 2019). Moreover, as LFA utilizes cellulose-based materials (such as paper), it is amenable to mass production at very low costs (Morales-Narv\u00e1ez et al., 2017). Hence, commercial LFAs targeting the aforementioned immunoglobulins even simultaneously have already been developed and approved around the world, including Australia, China, Germany, Singapore, South Korea and USA (Sheridan, 2020). These devices are now a valuable tool to monitor the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection using a drop of human serum, plasma or even whole blood, offering qualitative results within 15 min at the point of care; for example, at home or primary care (Sheridan, 2020). Interestingly, collective positive tests facilitated by LFAs could lead to spot herd immunity regions, thereby possibly abandoning lockdowns. Moreover, Germany is planning to issue \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d allowing citizens with positive antibody tests to stop their lockdown early (Bienkov). However, highly sensitive approaches enabling a quantitative testing are also demanded since the measurement of the virus-related immunoglobulin levels can be employed as diagnostic criteria for suspected cases with negative PCR results (\u201cRead Online-Handbook of COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment.pdf,\u201d 2020). In addition, determination of breadth and kinetics of immune responses can be meaningful to study non-severe cases of novel coronavirus, thereby forecasting infection outcome (Thevarajan et al., 2020). Although, employment of serological tests to determine COVID-19 immunity is still under debate (Feuer and William, 2020; Mallapaty, 2020), \u2014 likewise, the protection capability of face masks was cautiously discussed by WHO (Devlin and Campbell, 2020) \u2014 we believe that serological test will be a crucial tool to execute serosurveys (Stadlbauer et al., 2020), thereby, offering relevant information to take measures aimed at ceasing lockdowns and getting back to common life gradually.",

            "text": "Other biosensing strategies using antibodies to selectively capture the whole virus exist. A very recent example, CONVAT project, supported by the European Union, aims at the optical detection of the whole virus in 30 min to determine the viral load (viral content per mL) in saliva samples, whose result would be then followed via PCR in the same platform (\u201cLaura Lechuga, investigadora del CSIC: \u2018Llevamos tiempo reclamando que hay que invertir m\u00e1s dinero en prevenci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis,\u2019\u201d 2020). Similarly, graphene-based field-effect transistors, enabling portable devices, have been engineered to determine COVID-19 viral load in clinical nasopharyngeal samples, using a specific antibody against its spike protein (Seo et al., 2020). Viral load, which is conventionally determined using quantitative real-time PCR, is not only important to determine the severity of the infectious disease, but also to monitor viral dynamics in infected patients and a therapy response (Pan et al., 2020). Hence, viral load determination may help to facilitate decisions driven by personalized medicine, thereby, effective clinical procedures can be applied. Nevertheless, antibody-based approaches mainly suffer from their relatively slow (typically a few weeks) development when compared with nucleic acid tests against a new infection as well as from their time-consuming and expensive production. Depending on the specificity of the employed antibodies, they may also suffer from false positives caused by potential cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses. Importantly, existing literature summarizes current commercialized technologies focused on COVID-19 diagnosis and compare their strengths and weaknesses (Mallapaty, 2020; Sheridan, 2020).",

They are also valuable as a blueprint to formulate therapeutic procedures. The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, a top hospital in China with zero fatalities, recommends the surveillance of the following inflammatory response biomarkers for the SARS-CoV-2 infection: C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3. It is worth mentioning that low total number of lymphocytes at the onset of the disease is also an indicator of poor prognosis, whereas severe infections display a gradually decreased number of peripheral blood lymphocytes (\u201cRead Online-Handbook of COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment.pdf,\u201d 2020). Hence, lymphocyte analysis is also an effective resource in this emerging infectious disease. The clinical relevance of some of these biomarkers are discussed in Table 1\n. In this context, the biosensing community is urged to create affordable, rapid, sensitive and multiplexed systems amenable to mass production in order to detect these biomarkers simultaneously. Besides, biosensing devices incorporating artificial antibodies (such as molecularly imprinted polymers) (Zamora-G\u00e1lvez et al., 2017) or other innovative antibodies (ex., shark antibodies) (Matz and Dooley, 2019) would be of great value in emerging infectious disease diagnostics, since they are amenable to withstand harsh conditions during handling and delivery.",

            "text": "All in all, as early career scientists and members of the biosensing community, facing the most dramatic situation ever experienced in XXI century, we believe that we will undergo other disease outbreaks caused not only by viral but also bacterial pathogens, and the world has to rethink the way we cope with such situations. Thus, we offer the following seven recommendations:1.Investment in pandemic preparedness in terms of diagnostic tools is pivotal to prevent the spread of emerging infectious diseases. This should be a joint and even an international task of different entities, including governments, funding agencies, academia and industries. We believe timely and large-scale testing based on reliable biosensing technology might lead to avoid or soften stringent measures such as lockdowns, border closing and travel bans, as shown in the example of South Korea or Iceland.2.Collaborative networks should be formed and involve not only experts in biosensing but also in biosecurity and their corresponding facilities, as well as robust biotechnology companies ready for mass production. Actually, getting their central innovation opportunities in testing not dominated by already established methods (like PCR), the biosensing community will play a critical role to control, slow, hinder or prevent such pandemic outbreaks.3.In case of stringent measures such as border closings, each country should be prepared (i.e. sustainable and independent) in terms of manufacture of biosensing technology and protection equipment. For instance, Germany develops various kind of machines for the production of protection equipment but even Germany, itself, has a limited activity to fabricate its own protection materials such as masks and protective clothing, leading to shortages of these items.4.The aforementioned collaborative networks should be ready to develop new diagnostic tools or adapt the existing ones rapidly and the governments should offer fast-track approval programs (such as the Food and Drug Administration - FDA) to examine those tools rapidly.5.Biosensing devices for testing infectious diseases should rigorously satisfy the following requirements: They must be (i) disposable, offering reliable mass production, (ii) accessible and affordable, allowing large-scale population screening, (iii) easy-to-use by minimally trained users or even by the patients themselves, (iv) equipment-free or operated with an inexpensive and portable readout unit, (v) rapid, enabling short sample-to-result times (less than an hour), (vi) able to work with low sample volumes and easily accessible samples (for example, blood from a finger prick or non-invasive swab samples), (vii) highly selective and sensitive (if possible, without target amplification), delivering accurate results in accordance with central laboratory findings, (viii) with an integrated sample preparation (including lysis and isolation for nucleic acid testing, or plasma separation for proteomics), (ix) easily scalable and flexible to detect different targets using the same platform (such as CRISPR-powered systems), and (x) capable of multiplexing, simultaneous detection of different analytes including controls (Dincer et al., 2017). Ideally, these systems should also be able to perform multi-omics simultaneously (for instance, the detection of nucleic acids along with immunoglobulins)6.Internet-of-things, connecting sensors via databases with healthcare workers to realize a decentralized healthcare, is also an important tool to provide valuable insights in terms of emerging infectious disease scenarios and dynamics, determination of herd immunity regions, as well as epidemiology and big data. In order to secure all these information, Blockchain technology, known from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, could be applied for internet-of-things.7.General population should be trained in advance to perform effective self-sampling (for example, to collect nasal swabs) as well as self-testing (especially, for LFA-based immunity testing in order to estimate population coverage). In this regard, it would be helpful to have some classes in the high or secondary school, or seminars in companies where the general public gets familiar with issues like sample collection and performing self-tests (similar to fire drills).\n",

In cleavage-based approach, after the recognition event of the target gene of SARS-CoV-2, the Cas/crRNA complex gets activated and cleaves the surrounding labelled reporter RNAs (reRNA), resulting in a concentration-dependent signal change. For the binding-based CRISPR detection, a catalytically deactivated Cas/crRNA complex, specific to the target sequence of COVID-19, is immobilized on the sensor surface (for example, on a graphene-based field effect transistor as previously applied for detecting genetic mutations (Hajian et al., 2019)). Upon recognition of its target, the resulting signal can be read out via a handheld device.",
