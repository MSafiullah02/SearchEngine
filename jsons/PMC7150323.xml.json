Pneumonia results from the proliferation of microorganisms at these sites in combination with the host response to the presence of microorganisms.

These can be classified in a number of ways based on microbial etiology, underlying host defenses, and clinical presentation, among others. The most common initial grouping is by patient location at time of acquisition, that is, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia. Recently, a third category has been added: healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) (Table 2\n). This category was needed to designate patients with pneumonia developing outside the hospital but whose pathogenesis, causative agents, and antibiotic resistance patterns were more consistent with nosocomial pathogens. The majority of these patients are from nursing homes but the group also includes chronic dialysis patients or others with frequent or recent contact with the medical system. Within each of these categories, patients with compromised immunity are usually discussed separately, since the spectrum of causative etiologies is much larger and therefore the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches differ from that of patients with overtly normal host immunity. Most of these pneumonia syndromes have separate entries in this encyclopedia.",

In this disorder, a large volume aspiration episode, usually from a seizure or alcoholic stupor, occurs days to weeks before presentation with the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. The aspirated bolus is usually enriched with anaerobic microorganisms by the presence of severe gingivitis, which explains the fact that this syndrome is very rare in the edentulous.

In the elderly and those with an inadequate immune response, pneumonia may present with nonrespiratory symptoms such as delirium, fatigue, failure to thrive, worsening of an underlying chronic illness, or a fall. In elderly patients, fever may be absent but tachypnea is usually present, along with an abnormal physical examination of the chest. Unfortunately, none of these symptoms is unique to pneumonia.

However, for optimal antimicrobial management an etiologic diagnosis is also needed. Demonstrating the presence of a microorganism in culture or in stains of pathologic specimens are the classic methods to demonstrate the causative agent. Once again these methods are woefully inadequate for diagnosing pneumonia. The reason varies depending on the type of pneumonia. In community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), many of the causative microorganisms are not easily grown in culture and even with the most aggressive culture and extensive use of other diagnostic modalities, the etiologic diagnosis remains unknown in the majority of cases. In contrast, for nosocomial pneumonia, especially VAP, the high incidence of colonization frequently results in many false-positive cultures and polymicrobial cultures in monomicrobial pneumonias. For some of the chronic pneumonias such as tuberculosis and endemic fungal disease, the slow growth characteristics delay a definitive microbiologic diagnosis for weeks. The net result is that the antimicrobial treatment of pneumonia is often empiric. Clearly, new nonculture-based diagnostic methods are needed.",

VAP in patients recently admitted to the hospital and not receiving antibiotics will mimic the spectrum of acute CAP. Many pneumonias in immunocompromised patients are also caused by the typical CAP pathogens. Two factors combine to shift the spectrum away from that of typical CAP: (1) worsening immunocompromise; and (2) exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, especially when prolonged. An example of the former is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. When helper T-lymphocyte counts (cluster determinant or CD4) are >500 cells/mm3, usual CAP pathogens and tuberculosis are common causes of pneumonia. Once the CD4 count falls below 200 cells/mm3, opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jerovecii and CMV become more common.

The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses and is not believed to have circulated in humans previously. SARS-CoV is postulated to be a previously unknown animal coronavirus that mutated and developed the ability to infect humans. The high transmission rates, especially in healthcare settings and households, suggest that little native immunity to this virus existed previously.",

The emergence of antibiotic-resistant isolates has truly reached epidemic proportions for CAP and VAP. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are the norm for VAP. The emergence of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) is an increasingly common problem worldwide, with more than 40% of all pneumococci in some areas falling into this category by current definitions. Controversy exists, however, about the clinical relevance of in vitro resistance in the absence of meningitis, and whether new therapeutic approaches are required and whether resistance influences the outcome of CAP. When resistance to penicillin is present, there is often in vitro resistance to other agents. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus, previously thought to be exclusively a HAP pathogen, is now making an appearance as a cause of CAP.",

However, avoiding even starting antibiotics for nonbacterial infections, such as outpatient viral URIs, is the strategy most likely to slow this trend.",

Immune modulation can take three pathways. One is the development and use of less immunosuppressive treatments for malignancies and transplant patients. Important advances in this area have already resulted in renal transplant patients returning to a near normal response to bacterial pneumonia and infrequent occurrence of opportunistic pathogens causing pneumonia. The second route is immunization. Childhood immunization has a long track record of effectively preventing respiratory infections with pertussis and diphtheria. The only infections seen with these pathogens in developed societies are when vaccination has not been provided. Recently, the use of the Haemophilus influenzae and protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccines have nearly eliminated meningitis from these bacteria and significantly reduced the incidence of respiratory tract infections. Not only has the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine decreased infection in children but it has also resulted in a decrease in invasive infections in the child's adult caregivers. Even the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine appears to decrease the rate of invasive disease, even if it does not decrease overall pneumonia rates. The third immunomodulatory strategy is specific immunomodulation for established infection. The use of the colony-stimulating factors filgrastim and sargramostim for neutropenic patients is one example. The recent release of drotrecogin alfa activated (activated protein C) for severe sepsis offers some hope to improve the mortality of bacterial CAP, especially pneumococcal CAP.",
