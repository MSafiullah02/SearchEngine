Despite many reports have characterized the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the information of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation remains not reported. The curative and eradicative therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will reactivate, and whether risk factors predict SARS-CoV-2 reactivation in patients. To prevent and control COVID-19 reactivation, we retrospectively collected and analyzed detailed clinical data from SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients. In the study, we presented clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients and discussed the potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.",

The timing of onset of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation can be variable depending upon the host factors, underlying disease and the type of immunosuppressive therapies. In our study, the recovered patients had positive RT-PCR test results 4\u201317 days later. The key risk factors for reactivation would include 3 categories: (1) host status, (2) virologic factors and (3) type and degree of immunosuppression. Host factors may include sex, older age, type of disease needing immunosuppression. Although we could not identify risk factors for these host factors in the current study, the potential requires further large cohort confirmation. The virologic factors associated with increased risk of reactivation include high baseline SARS-CoV-2 load and variable genotype. SARS-CoV-2 viral load would also linked to treatment response, disease severity and progression.8 The association of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes and viral load with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation will be an important question to address. In our study, all the patients received antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir or Arbidol). These cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactivation may occur whatever the antiviral therapy used. These host and virologic factors are important considerations that may further increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Therefore, the assessment of host as well as virologic risk factors should be important caveats to help decide whether to initiate prophylactic therapy and immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive therapies are the commonly used causative agents. These agents have a general mechanism that inhibits many immune functions. For example, steroid inhibits cell-mediated immunity by suppressing interleukins production which is important for T and B cell proliferation.9 It is thus not surprising that these general immunosuppressive effects result in broad immune dysfunctions and potential SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.",
