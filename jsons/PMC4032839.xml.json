Several hard-to-cure diseases and complex syndromes including Alzheimer's disease, type 1 diabetes, and hepatocellular carcinoma have been associated with viral infections.[123] Moreover, due to increased global travel and rapid urbanization, epidemic outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging viruses represent a critical threat to public health, particularly when preventive vaccines and antiviral therapies are unavailable. Examples include the recent emergence of dengue virus, influenza virus, measles virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and West Nile virus outbreaks.[456] To date, however, many viruses remain without effective immunization and only few antiviral drugs are licensed for clinical practice. The situation is further exacerbated by the potential development of drug-resistant mutants, especially when using viral enzyme-specific inhibitors, which significantly hampers drug efficacy.[78910] Hence, there is an urgent need to discover novel antivirals that are highly efficacious and cost-effective for the management and control of viral infections when vaccines and standard therapies are lacking.",

Management of dengue-associated diseases consists of preventing the viral infection by mosquito control and relieving symptoms in the infected individuals. Development of prophylactic/therapeutic treatment against DENV infection using natural products may help address some of these current limitations. The flavone baicalein, for example, exerts potent activity against DENV adsorption to the host and post-entry viral replication.[28] In addition, several natural products such as quercetin and narasin, as well as marine seaweed extracts have been observed to possess significant anti-DENV properties.[293031] Recently, we have reported chebulagic acid and punicalagin, two hydrolysable tannins isolated from Terminalia chebula (\u8a36\u5b50 H\u0113 Z\u01d0), as broad-spectrum antiviral agents against several viruses including DENV.[32] Specifically, chebulagic acid and punicalagin can directly inactivate free DENV particles and interfere with the attachment and fusion events during early viral entry. Identification of these natural viral inhibitors could help the development of therapeutics against DENV infection and reduce the risks of DHF/DSS.",

HSV infection usually causes mucocutaneous lesions that occur in oral/perioral (typically by HSV-1) and genital (commonly by HSV-2) areas, as well as on other body sites. HSV causes lifelong infection by establishing itself in sensory neurons and can be reactivated by various stimuli including sunlight, fever, immunosuppression, menstruation, or stress.[68] Transmission of HSV results from contact with infected lesions and can occur via vertical transmission from infected mother to newborn. Although the disease is usually self-limited and can be treated with antivirals, severe complications can occur, particularly in neonates and immunosuppressed individuals, leading to risk of blindness with keratoconjunctivitis, and the potentially fatal meningitis and encephalitis.[6970]",

Although primary and recurrent infections can be controlled by nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir, penciclovir, and their prodrugs, the development of drug-resistant virus is becoming a serious problem, especially in immunocompromised patients.[71] Thus, identifying novel anti-HSV agents that act with different mechanisms is crucial for clinical management of HSV. We have previously reported several natural products and herbal medicines that inhibit HSV infection and replication. For instance, ent-epiafzelechin-(4\u03b1\u21928)-epiafzelechin, extracted from Cassia javanica, inhibits HSV-2 replication; the herbal prescriptions Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tan (\u9f8d\u81bd\u7009\u809d\u6e6f L\u00f3ng D\u01cen Xi\u00e8 G\u0101n T\u0101ng) and Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (\u8335\u9673\u84bf\u6e6f Y\u012bn Ch\u00e9n H\u0101o Tang) both possess broad efficiency in diminishing HSV-1 and HSV-2 infectivity; hippomanin A, geraniin, 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose, and excoecarianin isolated from Phyllanthus urinaria (\u8449\u4e0b\u73e0 Y\u00e8 Xi\u00e0 Zh\u016b) can potently impede HSV infection.[727374757677] In addition, we have also identified the hydrolyzable tannins chebulagic acid and punicalagin as cell surface glycosaminoglycan (GAG) competitors that can inhibit HSV-1 entry and cell-to-cell spread.[78] HSV-1 and also a multitude of viruses employ GAGs as initial attachment receptors during infection of their host cell. Both chebulagic acid and punicalagin are observed to target HSV-1 glycoproteins that interact with GAGs and, in turn, prevent their association with cell surface GAGs as well as subsequent binding receptors.[78] This inhibitory effect is shown (1) against cell-free virus, (2) during the viral attachment and fusion stages, and (3) in the intercellular junction spread of HSV-1, which is mediated by its glycoproteins. Thus, both tannins are demonstrated to be efficient entry inhibitors to HSV-1 and similar effects have been observed on another herpesvirus, the human cytomegalovirus, as well as on several other viruses known to engage GAGs for entry.[32]",

The nanoformulated melittin is demonstrated to possess robust efficiency in capturing and inactivating HIV particles by disrupting the viral lipid envelope.[106] Based on the discoveries made so far, the recent progress in identifying natural antivirals against HIV should yield potential novel therapeutics that could play an important role in overcoming the current urgency in anti-HIV/AIDS therapies.",

Furthermore, potential risks of cross-species transmission and host adaptation of influenza viruses between animals and humans resulting in highly pathogenic strains have also raised concerns.[112] Another issue is the widespread development of drug resistance, which has been observed with the first generation of anti-influenza medications, specifically the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine.[113] Resistant strains against the currently approved neuraminidase inhibitors (which prevent the release of mature influenza viruses) including oseltamivir and zanamivir have also already appeared.[114] Due to the drug resistance problems, the rapid evolution of influenza viruses, and the occurrence of several recent outbreaks (e.g., H5N1, H1N1, H7N9),[13] more sophisticated antiviral strategies are urgently needed to prevent and control potential pandemics with emerging influenza strains.",

Complications can occur leading to pneumonia and encephalitis, which can be potentially fatal.[123] Although highly contagious through contact of respiratory droplets or airborne aerosols, immunization against measles given as a three-part MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) has made MV infection relatively uncommon in developed countries. As recovery usually follows uncomplicated MV infection, there are currently no specific antiviral treatments for measles. Despite the existence of a successful vaccine against MV, the virus remains a major killer of children in developing countries.[124125] Another serious problem is the re-emergence of measles in vaccinated populations and in non-immunized adults, as highlighted by outbreaks in recent years.[6126127] These issues emphasize MV's medical importance and the need to develop suitable drug therapies.",

It is a ubiquitous pathogen and the leading cause of viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children.[139] Virtually all children become infected with RSV before the age of 2 years.[140] RSV infection typically results in mild symptoms in healthy adults, but can lead to bronchiolitis or pneumonia in infants and immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, infant RSV infection poses a potential risk for childhood asthma.[141142] Although RSV causes the most severe disease in young infants, it continues to plague humans throughout the course of a lifetime. Immunity to RSV is generally not sufficient to provide protection and, consequently, humans are prone to repeated reinfections[143144145] which can be life-threatening in the elderly or immunocompromised.[146147]",

Thus, there is a need to develop novel antivirals for the management of RSV infections. Several plant-derived natural products have been demonstrated to exhibit anti-RSV activity. Uncinoside A and B, the two chromone glycosides isolated from Selaginella uncinata, potently inhibit RSV infection.[148] Three biflavonoids, namely genkwanol B, genkwanol C, and stelleranol, extracted from Radix Wikstroemiae, have been observed to display antiviral activity against RSV.[149] Several flavone 6-C-monoglycosides from the leaves of Lophatherum gracile (\u6de1\u7af9\u8449 D\u00e0n Zh\u00fa Y\u00e8) have been shown to reduce RSV infection in cytopathic effect-reduction assay.[150] We have previously also identified several anti-RSV natural medicines, including the herbal prescription Sheng-Ma-Ge-Gen-Tang (\u5347\u9ebb\u845b\u6839\u6e6f Sh\u0113ng M\u00e1 G\u00e9 G\u0113n Tang) which is used for treating respiratory diseases, its major component herb Cimicifuga foetida L. (\u5347\u9ebb Sh\u0113ng M\u00e1), as well as the plant-associated bioactive compound cimicifugin.[151152153] In addition, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity that we have demonstrated for the hydrolyzable tannins chebulagic acid and punicalagin also includes antiviral effects against RSV infection.[32] Specifically, the two tannins can inactivate RSV particles and also block viral entry-related events, including binding and fusion. Interestingly, both chebulagic acid and punicalagin are, however, ineffective against RSV post-infection spread, but could abrogate the same event in MV, which is another paramyxovirus.[32] Besides targeting the viral infection, some natural products may help improve RSV-induced respiratory tract symptoms, including airway inflammation. Resveratrol is one such example, which has been observed to down-regulate IFN-\u03b3 levels and prevent airway inflammation/hyperresponsiveness during RSV infection in mice, suggesting its applicability in reducing RSV-induced airway symptoms.[154]",

Nonetheless, natural products serve as an excellent source of biodiversity for discovering novel antivirals, revealing new structure\u2013activity relationships, and developing effective protective/therapeutic strategies against viral infections. Many natural products and herbal ingredients are observed to possess robust antiviral activity and their discoveries can further help develop derivatives and therapeutic leads (e.g., glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives as novel anti-HBV agents, acetoxime derivative from the Mediterranean mollusk Hexaplex trunculus as inhibitor against HSV-1, and caffeic acid derivatives as a new type of influenza NA antagonist).[155156157] Our discovery of chebulagic acid and punicalagin being capable of inhibiting entry of several viruses due to their GAG-competing properties could help develop broad-spectrum antivirals for prevention and control of these viral pathogens. As many studies in this domain are only preliminary, further exploration in characterizing the bioactive ingredients, defining the underlying mechanisms, as well as assessing the efficacy and potential application in vivo is encouraged in order to help develop effective antiviral treatments. Furthermore, additional studies should also examine the possibility of combination therapies with other natural agents or with standard therapeutics, as a multi-target therapy may help reduce the risk of generating drug-resistant viruses. We believe that natural products will continue to play an important role and contribute to antiviral drug development.",
