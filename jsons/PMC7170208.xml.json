There are many personal or community risk factors which affect health status, and medical care is a vital aspect of the broad spectrum of health needs. Despite its value, medical care by itself is not sufficient to produce a high standard of population health. In order to promote optimal health, effective population-level prevention methods as described in previous chapters, availability of and access to care must be seen in the context of the individual and of societal conditions that increase the risk of disease, and application of appropriate measures to reduce those risks to prevent disease and promote health. Some of those interventions are provided by medical care and its preventive aspects. Other key aspects include social, sanitary, environmental, legal, economic, and educational factors. This interrelates with human resources for health (Chapter 14), financing and economics (Chapter 11), organization (Chapter 10), technology, law, and ethics (Chapter 15), and global health (Chapter 16).",

Each system developed in the political, social, and historical context of the country and continues to evolve. Developing countries are also struggling to achieve universal access to care and health for all by expanding primary health care and social security plans which provide benefits to workers and for certain vulnerable populations, primarily mothers and children. As they move up the scale of economic development, developing countries also address the problem of how to decrease morbidity and mortality, achieve equity in access to health care, and expand the funding basis for health care through national health insurance. Some countries are experiencing rapid economic development but lag behind in directing increased national wealth towards improving health status. This is often due to a lack of focused political commitment, trained policy analysts, and trained public health professionals (see Chapters 14 and 16Chapter 14Chapter 16).",

Removing financial barriers to care is necessary but not sufficient for optimal health and to address the health problems of an individual and of a society. Equity in financial access with universal coverage is vital to population and individual health since anyone can have serious illness at any time, and long-term preventive care is essential to good public health standards and quality health care. Inequalities exist in all societies but many have successfully reduced them by poverty reduction, job creation, education, and many other systems that reduce interregional, socioeconomic, and demographic differences in health. Special attention to high-risk groups in the population is essential. Groups may be based on age, gender, occupation, risky lifestyle, location of residence, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, economic status, or other factors that increase susceptibility to disease, premature death, or disability. Services should be based on need and not only demand, which can escalate costs by overservicing or, in effect, selective servicing of those with insured access and the knowledge, time, and capacity to make use of a health system. Health systems planning needs to promote access on patient assessment, but also those services that reach the entire population, especially people at high risk who are often least able to seek appropriate care.",

It was compulsory for all wage earners between the ages of 16 and 70. These workers made payments along with their employers and a state contribution. This two-part plan provided a contributory system for unemployment insurance and for medical care against illness for workers and their families. General practitioners (GPs) were paid on a capitation basis rather than a salary, preserving their status as self-employed professionals. Initially this plan covered one-third of the population, but coverage increased to one-half by 1940. Administration was through approved mutual benefit societies (friendly societies), some based on insurance companies and others founded by professional associations and trade unions.

National nutrition surveillance, via the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; see Chapter 8), and other systems of health status monitoring are reported in the professional literature and in publications of the CDC. National monitoring of hospital discharge information facilitates the understanding of patterns of utilization and morbidity. These information systems are vital for epidemiological surveillance and managing the health care system.",

This evolved into the regional health systems model. Following the 1970s\u2019 Castonguay\u2013Nepveau Commission Report, Quebec implemented Community Health Centers (CLSCs) throughout the province. In the 1990s, Saskatchewan began development of similar integrated district health service and regionalized hospital systems.

Services provided are based on residence in the province and are not transferrable between provinces. Manitoba Continuing Care, implemented in 1974, is an integrated community-based public sector funded program with a single entry point for home care and nursing home care. Assessment for admission is based on assessed health need; there are no income-based or ability-to-pay restrictions. Home care has developed as an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to both hospital and long-term care (Box 13.2\n). Services above the assessed health need are the responsibility of the client and not funded through the program. The program serves as an important adjunct to earlier hospital discharge. The range of services includes short-term (medical and postsurgical), long-term, and palliative care.BOX 13.2Manitoba Home Care ProgramThe Manitoba Home Care Program was established in 1974, as an integral component of the publicly funded health system enabling people to remain at home as an appropriate community-based alternative to care in hospital or nursing homes. Home Care is provided free of charge to permanent Manitoba residents who are Canadian citizens or landed immigrants. Services are based on assessed need, taking into account other resources available to the individual including families, and other community resources/programs.Regional health authorities are responsible for program management and deliver the services including assessment for and coordination of nursing home admissions within the policy framework and standards of the Department of Health. Accreditation Canada is the established body for standards and the accrediting process for home care programs of the regional health authorities.In 2011/2012, of the $4.7 billion ($3800 per capita) provincial health expenditures for insured health services, 6.5 percent ($300 million) or $244 per capita was for home care. In comparison, long-term care (nursing home) and acute care hospital costs were $482 and $1754 per capita, respectively. The cost of insured health services in 2011\u20132012 was $4000 per capita. The percentage distribution of costs for acute care, long-term care, and mental health was 46 percent, 13 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. However, the federal Canada Health Act for hospital and medical services is not applicable to extended health care or home care programs; therefore, there is no portability of services between provinces.Eligibility and admission to the program are based on a functional needs assessment by the assigned health professional (case manager) with reassessments at predetermined intervals. The program requires the designation of a relative or close friend as the primary contact person as needed from time to time. In some situations a family member living in another province is the contact person. Services may include nursing, personal care (bathing, dressing, feeding), physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and homemaking and respite care. Other services such as speech therapy, social work, and dietitian services may be accessible. Supportive services may include day care in a funded health facility; other community services include meals on wheels and friendly visitor services.In 2011, of the 17,202 assessments for eligibility, 15,481 were admitted and 14,710 were discharged. There is a monthly average of nearly 24,000 individuals receiving services, with the majority of services provided by a home care attendant, and about one-third of the clients receive registered nurse services.The Manitoba Health Care Appeal Board was established to ensure that residents of Manitoba have access to an independent arms-length appeal process for publicly funded insured health services including home care. If a person is not satisfied with certain decisions regarding a financial or service delivery matter, an appeal may be made to the Board.Since 1974 results of periodic extensive external reviews by internationally recognized management consultants have consistently shown the program to be a cost-effective appropriate alternative to facility care. Shortly after its implementation, the program was recognized as an important model for health systems by the World Health Organization.Sources: Joan Bickford MSN, Former Chief Public Health Nurse, Manitoba Health, Province of Manitoba, Canada.

Patients register with GPs and are referred to hospitals and specialists in accordance with medical needs. GPs have traditionally been paid on a capitation basis for the patients registered with them, and the patient has the right to change GP. Capitation is the allocation of funds per person registered as a service beneficiary for a specified period to cover care for a range of services. Weighted capitation is allocation per person, with adjustments made for factors such as age, gender, and regional standardized mortality rates (SMRs), which reflect both need and demand for health services. SMRs are used as a proxy for morbidity in capitation allocation (see Chapter 3). GPs are paid extra premiums for performance indicators; for example, specific preventive services such as immunization, Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, and mammogram screening. In 2008, a pay-per-performance program called Advancing Quality was introduced in 24 NHS hospitals in the Northwest of England (population 6.8 million), and a clinically significant reduction in hospital mortality was observed compared to other hospitalized populations in other regions; the largest reduction was observed for heart diseases and especially for pneumonia (1.9 percentage points) (Sutton et al., 2013).\n",

This empowered GPs to negotiate with the hospitals, reduce waiting times, and improve other health care conditions for their patients, placing the hospital in the position of having to compete for the referral work of the GP.

Local authorities are required to have specialized staff to promote motor vehicle safety, which contributed to a reduction in road crash mortality from over 24 per 100,000 population in 1970 to just over 3 per 100,000 in 2010. A new Water Act and Environmental Protection Act of 1990 increased the supervisory and regulatory role of the national government in these areas of public health.",

The mandate is to give local authorities a stronger role in shaping services, and widen the focus on education, research, and training. Previously, all NHS planning and delivery was done by the Department of Health, strategic health authorities (SHAs), and PCTs. Under this act, NHS providers are no longer performance managed by the SHAs. In 2013 this plan includes the abolition of PCTs and SHAs, and the introduction of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). These CCGs are to replace the PCTs and SHAs, which will become foundation trusts by 2014. The NHS planning and delivery functions of the Department of Health, the PCTs, and the SHAs will be merged into the authority of a commissioning board called NHS England.

            "text": "The UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements allow a powerful executive to implement wide-ranging reforms at great speed, often with limited consultation. After seven or more major reorganizations since the NHS was founded in 1948 and a widespread feeling of \u201creform fatigue\u201d, the Conservative Party pledged, prior to the 2010 general election, \u201cno more top\u2013down reorganizations of the NHS\u201d. However, this pledge did not survive the election. The 2012 reform has created an extremely complex system with many unclear lines of accountability. The legislation is extremely permissive and the eventual result is uncertain. At some stage it will have to be revised significantly to create a workable system (see Box 13.4\n). An animated description of the NHS in England, setting out the extent of the confusion, can be viewed at the King\u2019s Fund website.BOX 13.4National Health Service Reform of 2013: Clarity NeededThe proposed new NHS reform promised to hand power to general practitioners (GPs) who, it was claimed, knew best what their patients needed as the previous primary care trusts purchased services on behalf of a defined population but were criticized as bureaucratic and remote. Draft legislation expanded this simple idea into an incomprehensible 300 page document. But barely concealed within it was a major drive to open delivery of care to the full force of the market, implementing the plans of Conservative politicians of two decades previously.This was presented as enabling small non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide services such as mental health and palliative care. Ministerial reassurances attracted support from some general practitioners and heads of NGOs, although these were contradicted by the draft legislation. Given the confusion, the government instituted a \u201clistening pause\u201d, and then reintroduced the legislation with a few cosmetic changes. Regulations published a few days before the legislation came into force in April 2013 required that almost all health care delivery be subject to competitive tendering, but lacked clarity as to what this meant in practice.The resulting system is one of remarkable complexity with confusion about responsibility. Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), now with only token involvement of GPs, are responsible for purchasing some aspects of care. However, they are subject to detailed oversight by a new body, NHS England, which is responsible for purchasing general practice and more complex services. CCGs obtain technical support from soon to be privatized clinical support units, seen by some as the basis for future competing insurers. They are also advised by clinical senates, designed to provide advice on complex clinical issues. This system is overseen by two regulatory bodies, the Care Quality Commission, responsible for quality of care, and Monitor, responsible for competition (overlapping with the Office of Fair Trading, which covers all sectors of the economy).Delivery of care is becoming a very mixed economy. As predicted, most contracts (mainly community services so far) have gone not to niche NGOs but to large multinational corporations. NHS hospitals are increasingly becoming independent foundation trusts, responsible for their own budgets. Since 2010, cuts in NHS funding have left many with severe financial problems, with debts from earlier private finance initiatives for capital development. Many have responded by cutting staffing, with resulting problems of quality and accountability.The demise of primary care trusts means that the public health function no longer has a home, and is fragmented among a new body, Public Health England, and departments of local government. Some public health staff involved in purchasing care have moved to CCGs.Sources: Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

It has established and prioritized objectives, quantitative targets, and evidence-based interventional strategies necessary to improve health and reduce health inequalities. The initiative is similar Healthy People 2020 of the US DHHS and has served as one of the templates for the WHO\u2019s Health 2020.BOX 13.5Healthy Israel 2020 InitiativeHealthy Israel 2020 (HI2020) is a national health targeting initiative coordinated by the Israeli Ministry of Health. It was conceived in 2005 along the lines of other international efforts such as Healthy People 2010 of the US Department of Health and Human Services. HI2020 is meant to provide a preventive health blueprint for the country to improve life expectancy and quality of life, and at the same time to reduce health inequalities.Twenty broad domains were chosen, which were further subdivided into specific topics, bringing the total number to 30. These included health determinants such as lifestyle behaviors, nutrition, injury and violence prevention, and enhancement of occupational and environmental health; health states such as oral health, mental health, non-communicable and infectious disease prevention; and age-related topics such as maternal and child health and geriatric health. Infrastructure topics such as education and training of the preventive workforce, as well as data development, and utilitarian/implementation topics such as health communications and marketing were also addressed. Committee members were selected from relevant government ministries, the academic community, the four health maintenance organizations or \u201cSick Funds\u201d, and non-governmental organizations. Committees were asked to generate reports containing an epidemiological overview describing the health and economic burden of their respective topics, craft health objectives and target values to reach by the year 2020, and to prioritize evidence-based interventions to achieve them.The first reports, published in 2011, dealt with three main lifestyle health behaviors: physical activity enhancement, obesity control, and healthful nutrition. These served as the basis for a broad implementation program entitled the National Healthy Lifestyle Program (NHLP) led by the Ministry of Health in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The NHLP focuses on legislative initiatives, implementation efforts in a variety of healthy cities, and incentive packages for health care organizations to enhance preventive screening and counseling by clinic personnel countrywide. It was adopted by the Israeli government in late 2011.Expert workshops are another means of implementing committee recommendations. To date, workshops have been held on topics such as curbing excessive alcohol use, geriatric health, and alertness enhancement, to develop specific, real-world recommendations. The introduction of Internet-based, interactive information is planned in 2013 for both health professionals and the lay public.The HI2020 initiative has received international recognition as one of the templates for the Health 2020 of the European office of the World Health Organization. That said, various challenges loom on the horizon: Can implementation efforts already underway stay true to the guiding recommendations? How should resource appropriation be optimized among the large number of current and future recommendations? Will governmental and municipal funding for the interventions be sustained? How will new interventional, health economic, and health services research findings be integrated to upgrade existing programs? Proven Ministry commitment to evidence-based public health to date augurs well for the continued integration of this approach in developing government health promotion policies.Sources: Elliot Rosenberg MD, MPH, National Coordinator, Healthy Israel 2020 and Director, Department of Occupational Health, Israel Ministry of Health.

The program provides annual reports of a national set of quality indicators for community health care (available at: http://healthindicators.ekmd.huji.ac.il).The purpose is to evaluate community-based medical care in Israel, and the variations in quality of care between subgroups in the population. The indicators collected are population measures to enable evaluation of the development of quality medical care, identification of areas that require intervention, improved data collection, effectiveness of care, and comparison of Israel\u2019s indicators to those of other countries. Indicators are based on a consensus of Israel\u2019s four health plans and national and international guidelines.The community health care indicators in the QICH report are based on the computer databases of each of the health plans without personal identifiers; missing data are a small percentage (0.6 percent) of the population. QICH indicator data are harmonized to produce national rates which undergo a data audit by each health plan, the program management team, and a certified external auditor.The QICH 2008\u20132010 report comprised 35 indicators of community health care covering six health topics: asthma, cancer screening, immunizations for elderly, children\u2019s health, cardiovascular health, and diabetes care. Indicator domains comprise primary prevention, disease management, and effectiveness of care. Rates are available for year, gender, and a proxy for socioeconomic status based on exemption from national health insurance.The quality indicators show continuing improvements in health promotion in the general population and disease control, increasing quality of care over time for some measures, and maintenance of the existing high levels of quality for others. Annual reports with longitudinal assessment of quality measures for community health, along with data on financial performance and patient satisfaction, provide policy makers with data for making informed decisions and health policy.Sources: Dena Jaffe PhD, Israel national Program for Quality Indicators in Community Healthcare.

The health insurance schemes are generally basic and inaccessible, with only 11 percent of the population having any form of health insurance coverage. Since 2005, the National Rural Health Mission has attempted to encourage state governments to join a central sponsored scheme that seeks to quickly increase the delivery of good-quality health care, especially to poor people living in rural areas. In 2009, a national health insurance (Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana) for people living below the poverty line was initiated, with joint federal (75 percent) and state (25 percent) financing. In general, most of the southern states are better organized for immunization and other primary care services than the northern states, demonstrating the high variability among them in health financing, outputs, and outcomes.",

Health spending per capita since 2000 has increased more than twice as fast as economic growth on average across OECD countries (4.0 percent versus 1.6 percent), resulting in an increasing share of the economy being devoted to health in most countries, but there is some slowing in the rate of increase.

They are large employers and among the biggest economic sectors in their respective countries. All face problems of financing, cost constraint, overcoming structural inefficiencies, and, at the same time, funding incentives for high quality and efficiency. Funding in health care still predominantly goes to biomedical aspects including research, so that community-oriented health promotion aspects are less well supported despite social inequities being so widespread, in even the high-income countries. The long-standing struggle between the germ theory and the miasma theory orientation is still present, and a new balance needs to be found to deal with the issues of aging, mental health, and health promotion in all its aspects, as well as providing medical and hospital care.",

The quality of the health protection community infrastructure (sewage, water, roads, and communication), the quantity and quality of food, levels of education, and professional organization are all parts of this continuum. Narrow planning for health systems ignores this message at the risk of missing its targets of improved health indicators, such as those adopted by the UN as the MDGs, and control of the burden of NCDs and injuries. National health systems are not only a matter of adequacy and methods of financing and assuring access to services; they address health promotion, national health targets, and adaptation to changing needs of the population, the environment, and a broad intersectoral approach to health of the population and the individual. The structure, content, and quality of a health system play a vital role in the social and economic development of a society and its quality of life.",

The former socialist countries have gone through painful periods of transition. Many countries have developed free-market systems with dynamic growth in national economies. Health systems have struggled to adapt but great gains in longevity and reduced mortality from preventable diseases have been made in many countries. Public and private donor partnerships have emerged to help the poorest countries to cope with overwhelming health problems of HIV, TB, malaria, diarrheal and respiratory diseases, and the vaccine-preventable diseases.",

A system of national health must be able to allocate resources to meet the needs of those with the highest risk of early disability or death, and not simply be a payment system for doctors and hospitals. The issue of changing demographics and epidemiological challenges must also be addressed.
