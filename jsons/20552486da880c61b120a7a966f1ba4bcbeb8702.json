Considering the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of this method, the requirements for proper internal reference gene(s) for relative expression normalization have become much more stringent. Given the increasing interest in the functional genomics of Eucalyptus, we sought to identify and experimentally verify suitable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression associated with the flower, leaf and xylem of six species of the genus. We selected 50 genes that exhibited the least variation in microarrays of E. grandis leaves and xylem, and E. globulus xylem. We further performed the experimental analysis using RT-qPCR for six Eucalyptus species and three different organs/tissues. Employing algorithms geNorm and NormFinder, we assessed the gene expression stability of eight candidate new reference genes. Classic housekeeping genes were also included in the analysis. The stability profiles of candidate genes were in very good agreement. PCR results proved that the expression of novel Eucons04, Eucons08 and Eucons21 genes was the most stable in all Eucalyptus organs/tissues and species studied. We showed that the combination of these genes as references when measuring the expression of a test gene results in more reliable patterns of expression than traditional housekeeping genes.

However, in comparison with classical RT-PCR, the main advantages of RT-qPCR are its higher sensitivity, specificity of measurements, and broad quantification range of up to seven orders of magnitude (Bustin 2002 , Gachon et al. 2004 ), besides being a great aid to study expression in genes whose transcript levels are known to be very low (Higuchi et al. 1993) . The analysis by RT-qPCR has become the most common method for validating whole-genome microarray data or of a smaller set of genes, and molecular diagnostics (Giulietti et al. 2001 , Chuaqui et al. 2002 . Accurate normalization is an absolute prerequisite for correct measurement of gene expression, and the most commonly used normalization strategy involves standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene. Therefore, the ideal reference gene should exhibit invariable expression levels among all different cell types, tissues, organs, developmental stages or treatments that are submitted to the test organism (Vandesompele et al. 2002 , Andersen et al. 2004 ). However, it has become clear that no single gene is constitutively expressed in all cell types and under all experimental conditions. It has been shown extensively that the expression of the so-called 'housekeeping' genes, although constant under some experimental conditions, can vary quite considerably in other cases, implying that the expression stability of the intended control gene has to be verified before each experiment (Thellin et al. 1999 , Volkov et al. 2003 , Czechowski et al. 2005 Relative expression of the isoprenoid biosynthetic gene dxr in different tissues/organs of Eucalyptus by RT-qPCR and normalization with different reference gene pairs.

Let H = {h 1 , h 2 , h 3 ,. . ., h o } be a set of hybridizations, where o ! 2. Let M = {T 1 , T 2 , T 3 ,. . ., T n } be a set of tissues, where n ! 2 and each element T contains a set of hybridizations such that T & H, and T x T Ty = \u00d8 for any x 6 \u00bc y.

Sd gq is equal to zero when Avg(T 1 g q ) = Avg(T 2 g q ) = Avg(T 3 g q ) = . . . = Avg(T n g q ), i.e. the gene q has exactly the same expression level in all tissues. The value of Sd gq increases proportionally to growth of difference among Avg(T 1 g q ), Avg(T 2 g q ), Avg(T 3 g q ),. . . and Avg(T n g q ). So, SDMA can rank the n most similarly expressed, i.e. those n genes for which Sd g is closer to zero.
