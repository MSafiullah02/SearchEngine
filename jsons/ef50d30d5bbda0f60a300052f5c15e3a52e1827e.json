Using a perspective based on quality of life and well-being in different ecological systems, it is argued that the process of introducing the Bill is the \"heat\" which has ignited the \"fuels\" represented by 12 preexisting and new issues in quality of life and well-being. These issues included distrust in the Central Government, lack of national identity, political dissatisfaction, economic strains, mental health threats, drop in family quality of life, lack of life skills education, lack of evidence-based national education in the formal curriculum, slow response of the Government, and alleged excessive use of force by the police. The fire has been intensified by \"four strong winds\", including disinformation and misinformation, anonymity of the protesters, public support for the students, and support given by parties outside Hong Kong. Possible solutions in terms of promotion of quality of life and well-being with reference to the fire triangle are discussed.",

Besides, there was damage of 85 Mass Transit Railway stations and 68 Light Railway stations, assault and doxing people holding contrary political views, and damage of shops owned by those who did not support the social movement (RTHK Radio 1 2020). Perhaps the most striking examples are the damage of the Legislative Council building on July 1, 2019 and the occupation of The Chinese University of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in November 2019.

            "text": "Finally, the social movement has created well-being problems in people of Hong Kong. Based on a large community sample, Ni et al. (2020) reported that the prevalence of probable depression was 11.2% in 2019 which was much higher than that during 2009-14 (1.9%) and 6.5% after the Occupy Central Movement in 2017. Besides, the estimated PTSD prevalence rate was 12.8%. Mogul (2019) also pointed out that PTSD symptoms were common in the protesters. Ng (2020) used the term \"mental health tsunami\" to describe the situation which was brought forth by the repeated and direct involvement in violent conflicts between protesters and police, exposure to violence, disintegration of families and friends, and the declining economic conditions. Why the Fire Broke out? Quality of Life and Well-Being Issues as Fuels We can use \"fire\" to represent the social event which has lasted for roughly 8 months. Obviously, the fundamental question is why the fire broke out. In view of the highly political nature of the social movement, there are views suggesting that the event was initiated and orchestrated by forces outside Hong Kong. Such views are primarily driven by the notion of \"color revolution\" which has occurred in places like Tunisia and Ukraine. In addition to Western influences, Taiwan has been suspected to play a strong role in the social movement. The reasoning is that by highlighting the message that the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement does not work, the President of Taiwan (Tsai Ing Wen) would get more support in the presidential election in 2020. Although these conspiracy conjectures make sense on the surface, we need empirical evidence that cannot be easily substantiated. Also, conspiracy theories alone do not give full attention to the psychology of the protesters and they cannot explain the perpetual involvement of young people as well as the determination of some of them to die for the sake of producing political changes in Hong Kong.",

A pioneer paper on the protests in Hong Kong in 2019 was written by Purbrick (2019) who argued that in addition to errors in police operations, housing, poverty, and governance are three key factors underlying the social event. In this paper, we attempt to understand the social movement from the perspective of quality of life and well-being. The main thesis is that the social unrest exists because there are threats to and issues in quality of life and well-being in Hong Kong.",

Obviously, threats to quality of life in these domains would arouse fear and distress for an individual. From a societal perspective, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2011) proposed the following indicators of human well-being: health status, work and life balance, education and skills, social connections, civic engagement and governance, environmental quality, personal security, and subjective well-being. Again, threats in well-being in these domains, particularly in the areas of governance and personal security, would lead to strong reactions from people in the society.",

Although Hong Kong physically returned to China on July 1, 1997, it has been difficult for Hong Kong people to develop a high level of trust in the Beijing Government for two reasons. First, people tend to fixate on the unfortunate history of the Cultural Revolution and June 4th incident of 1989. Second, as corruption in Mainland China has been a thorny problem since the opening of China in the late 1970s, governance in China has been seen in a negative light by Hong Kong people. Empirically, studies showed that the level of trust in the Beijing Government has been fluctuating with roughly 47.7% of the respondents having no trust in the first 6 months of 2019 (Public Opinion Poll, The University of Hong Kong 2019b).

The negative stereotypes formed for Mainland Chinese people (e.g., poor hygiene and snobbishness) also constitute blocks to identify with the Chinese national identity.

First, the current political system gives heavier weight to the businessmen who have been blamed to create economic and social inequalities in Hong Kong. Second, as the Government of the SAR has not been working effectively after the handover, people generally want to have more say in important decisions for Hong Kong.

According to some surveys, the housing price in Hong Kong and the cost of living were the highest in the world (Arcibal 2020) . There are three consequences of this situation. First, young people would find it difficult to get married, hence creating much frustration in youngsters. For some of the married young couples, they may be forced to stay in sub-divided flats that have security and hygiene problems. Second, parents are expected to help children (as reflected in the saying of \"the success of young people depends on the hard work of the father\") which creates much intergenerational conflict in the family. Finally, the rocket high housing price creates a sense of hopelessness in young people because it would be a heavy burden even for young professionals to buy a decent flat. The high housing price obviously triggers much negative emotions in young people. With the Extradition Bill, it is a good opportunity for them to air out their anger and hopelessness as well as a desire for \"mutual destruction\" (i.e., let us have nothing together). The high housing price is an obvious threat to physical well-being (shelter), psychological well-being (hopelessness), family well-being (conflict and tension within the family), social well-being (rich-poor divide), and political wellbeing (hatred for the Government for its ineffective housing policies).",

With the introduction of more self-financed sub-degree and degree programs, many graduates are not able to move up the social ladder because the real income for university graduates has been quite stagnant since the handover (New Century Forum and New Youth Forum 2015). Again, lack of upward social mobility triggers negative emotions in young people which eventually promotes a sense of hopelessness in young people (Shek and Siu 2019b) . This also explains why young people have psychological resistance to return to China because their lives have not improved much after the handover. It is also why some young people waved the British flag during demonstrations which are clearly a sign of remembering the \"good old days\" for university students under the British rule. Obviously, the lack of opportunity for Hong Kong young people to have upward mobility is a serious threat to individual well-being and societal quality of life. Nevertheless, young people are commonly not aware of the fact that the lack of social mobility also exists in many developed countries in the world and there was also much inequality under the British rule.",

            "text": "Under the influence of the Chinese culture, Hong Kong emphasizes strongly on academic excellence and achievement, with success commonly defined in terms of good grades in public examinations and earning a lot of money. Such social mentalities have three consequences. First, striving for academic excellence can be very stressful for young people which impairs their personal well-being. One consequence is that young people are prone to develop internalizing behavior such as depression and suicide. In fact, the appeal for \"mutual destruction\" can be regarded as a manifestation of mass internalizing behavior. Second, the exam-oriented system naturally creates \"losers\" in young people. As only 18% of high school graduates can get Governmentfunded university places, the number of \"losers\" created every year is quite substantial. Third, it would be difficult for students to find authentic life meaning in study except \"getting good grades\". Most of the time, young people in Hong Kong have \"foreclosure\" identity according to the psychosocial theory of Erik Erikson (i.e., commitment without crisis). Hence, when young people face the slogan of \"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of the time\", the social movement gives them a noble and romantic life meaning which can be easily incorporated in their identity. In short, the morbid emphasis on academic excellence undermines the academic and personal well-being of students which can be easily filled by some heroic and grand ideals such as revolutionize Hong Kong to make the tomorrow better.",

Shek and Siu (2019b) argued that the developmental context for Hong Kong adolescents is \"unhappy\", including unhealthy values, de-emphasis of holistic youth development, rise in hopelessness but drop in life satisfaction, emphasis on academic excellence but de-emphasis on academic quality of life, poverty, parenting issues, and drop in family well-being. Obviously, stresses and risk factors in adolescent development can easily be translated into poor mental health amongst young people. There are research findings showing that adolescent hopelessness rises but life satisfaction drops in adolescent years (Shek and Liang 2018) . At the same time, their academic stress increases but their perceived support from school decreases (Shek and Chai 2019) . In other words, the well-being of adolescents in Hong Kong is at risk. In the special issue edited by Shek and Siu (2019b) , the papers show that mental health is a growing concern in young people in Hong Kong. There are also findings suggesting that mental health problems in university students are prevalent (Lo et al. 2018 . In other words, young people with poor well-being are emotionally charged time bombs waiting to be detonated. Finally, students with special educational needs may be a factor that should not be overlooked. When we examine the slogans of the protesters, it is not uncommon to see that there are many incorrectly written Chinese characters. There are two possible explanationseither the protesters are poorly educated or they are dyslexic who are commonly having difficulties in writing Chinese characters. It is noteworthy that students with special education needs (e.g., those with autistic features or dyslexic) are stubborn in their views.",

Without such systematic education, the personal well-being of young people in Hong Kong cannot be adequately protected (Shek and Siu 2019a) . The neglect of soft skills education for young people in Hong Kong means that they do not possess adequate social competence skills to negotiate with other people or resolve conflicts, which are much needed. As intense anger and hatred are involved in the social event, learning how to empathize (look at things from others' perspective), manage one's and others' emotion (emotional quotient), forgive (write off emotional feelings and debts), and re-conciliate (re-build new relationships and move on) are important tasks for adolescents. These life skills are very important because there are studies showing that Hong Kong adolescents showed narcissistic behavior (Leung 2013 ) and positive youth development attributes negatively predicted the use of foul language in adolescents (Shek and Lin 2017).",

Besides, while national education is undertaken by the Education Bureau (formal school curriculum), the Home Affairs Bureau (Committee on the Promotion of Civic Education), and the Labor and Welfare Bureau (Youth Section in the Social Welfare Department), there is little coordinated effort amongst the different bureaus.

While an increase in knowledge is easy to demonstrate, positive change in attitude and behavior may not be easy to assess objectively. In view of the sensitive nature of Chinese History, some schools simply cut the subject under the new education reform.

Obviously, such allegations are great threats to the personal well-being of the protesters and the social well-being of Hong Kong. On the one hand, some videos in the news reports and the Internet strongly suggest that excessive force might have been used by the police. While some of the related complaints are still under the investigation of the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), the mechanism does not earn the trust of Hong Kong people for two reasons. First, some IPCC members were appointed by the Government, which means that their independence is doubtful. Second, many protesters experiencing excessive force by the police do not complain because they have the fear that they will be prosecuted for involvement in riots. On the other hand, it should be noted that \"innocence before proven guilty\" is the cornerstone of the Common Law and the establishment of police violence and brutality requires evidence beyond reasonable doubt. Besides, objectivity of some videos uploaded to the Internet is not clear. In addition, it would not be objective if we ignore the fact that public perceptions of the police had been very good before the social event and the Hong Kong Police ranked very high in terms of professional service in international surveys. For example, in the Human Freedom Index (V\u00e1squez and Por\u010dnik 2019) , Hong Kong police ranked sixth (6th) under the indicator of \"reliability of police\". In the Legatum Prosperity Index (2019), Hong Kong police ranked fourth (4th) out of 167 countries and regions under the indicator of \"safety and security\". Similarly, Hong Kong police ranked fourth (4th) under \"order and security\" in the World Justice Project (2019). Of course, having an excellent record does not necessarily mean that the alleged police issues do not exist.

            "text": "1. Trust in the Beijing Government: It is important to build up trust in the Beijing Central Government. In social psychological literature, the contact hypothesis suggests that contact is very important to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew and Tropp 2005) . Hence, increased contact to understand Mainland China will be helpful. Looking at the bright and dark sides of China (as these two aspects exist in all countries) and appreciating the progress of China in the past four decades such as poverty alleviation for around 850 million people according to the World Bank (He 2019) and acknowledgment of social problems (such as corruption) would be important. 2. Nurturance of Chinese national identity: It takes time to nurture because one has to \"fall in love\" and take pride in being Chinese. Systematic education at the community, family, and school contexts are indispensable so that young people can develop a sense of shared identity which further strengthens their positive identity. 3. Political well-being: This is tough because the change in the political system will not take place overnight. In addition, as Hong Kong is an international financial center, it is not easy to reduce the influence of business corporations and related interest groups. However, given the recent overwhelming victory of the Pan-Democratic camp in the District Council election in November 2019, young people who wish to change can still play an active role in the future Legislative Council and the Chief Executive elections. In any case, everybody has to learn that in an open and civilized society, we have to respect the views of the majority. 4. Poverty alleviation and solving the housing problem: It is a high time to re-visit the issue of poverty in Hong Kong which also exists in many countries in the world. Besides the work of the Commission on Poverty, every sector has to rethink about their role. In addition to financial capital, building human capital, family capital and social capital is also important to strengthen the developmental assets of poor adolescents, which can help them escape from the trap of intergenerational poverty. As housing implies physical security which shapes hope, this is the top priority issue to be addressed. 5. Upward mobility: This is not easy to solve this issue because it is a global issue that is not specific to Hong Kong. However, as many young people do not want to join the manual labor force which can give a reasonable salary, there is a need to change the community culture to one that treasures different talents (i.e., not just scholastic skills) and there are different career paths for young people with different aspirations, interests, and skills. 6. Education reform: There is a need to deeply reflect on the purpose and nature of education so that young people can study for their interests (i.e., not just for the \"rice bowl\") and multiple intelligences are emphasized. The challenge is not just for the Government, but also for parents and the Hong Kong society. 7. Promotion of adolescent well-being: Relevant and adequate services should be provided for young people who need mental health services. A public health approach focusing on universal, selective and indicated prevention should be used. In particular, services for students with special education needs should be stepped up. Besides, finding ways to promote hope and life satisfaction is also a priority task. In addition to changing the macro-environmental factors leading to hopelessness, evidence-based programs to cultivate resilience and hope in young people, such as the Project P.A.T.H.S. (Shek and Sun 2013; Ma et al. 2019 ) are indispensable. 8. Promotion of family well-being: Problem families are the ideal breeding grounds for adolescent externalizing behavior. Hence, there is a need to promote family resilience in a high-risk environment and to strengthen parenting, communication as well as conflict resolution skills in the family. It is noteworthy that evidencebased programs on promotion of family resilience are almost non-existent in Hong Kong. 9. Promotion of Life skills education: In the absence of systematic life skills, socialemotional learning skills, and psychosocial competencies training in the formal education curriculum in Hong Kong, this gap should be urgently addressed (Shek and Siu 2019a) . Young people should learn that: a) \"an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\"; b) the essence of democracy is respecting the views of everyone, including those who do not hold the same views; c) it is morally wrong to blackmail the Government by kidnapping the innocent public; d) besides rights and social justice, there are other virtues, including love, acceptance, and forgiveness, that are equally important; and e) while one can \"criticize\" the Government, one should also look at things from different perspectives in a \"critical\" manner. 10. Development and implementation of systematic moral and national education:",

As conflict resolution and mutual respect are not adequately covered in the current moral and national education curriculum, there is an urgent need to review and step up the related policies in Hong Kong. When implemented, policymakers should be aware of the related fears, such as the worry of brainwashing the young people. As such, practices in other countries can serve as the reference point because \"international standards\" will be used.",

For example, sufficient consultation time should be given to sensitive issues like the Extradition Bill. Concerning the influence of social media, there is no way to stop it unless we follow what the Spanish Government did to deal with the occupation of the airport. However, the public can learn how to critically differentiate correct information, misinformation, and disinformation, particularly information disseminated and acquired through the social media. For anonymity, while it is a protection for not being arrested, people wearing masks should understand that anonymity would unleash the dark side of human nature. Concerning public endorsement of violence, several questions should be considered by the public: a) What is the \"civilized\" and \"mature\" form of public demonstration? b) Assuming the police has used excessive force, is vandalism the best response (i.e., \"an eye for an eye\")? c) How can we promote peaceful co-existence within diversity in political views? These are obvious quality of life issues awaiting answers. Regarding alleged police violence brutality, there is a social consensus on setting up an independent panel of inquiry. However, to be fair to the police and protesters, if an independent panel of inquiry is established, it should examine violence and excessive use of force in both the protesters and police. Finally, a critical understanding of the comments made by foreign Governments and parties should be realizedwhether they are genuine concerns about Hong Kong or disguised manifestations of political and/or national interest.",

Without understanding quality of life issues in different ecological systems (such as fear about losing freedom, lack of political well-being, growing up in a poor environment, always being a loser, living without hope, inability to forgive and re-build), it would not be possible to find workable and meaningful solutions.

After some 53 years, it is interesting to note that some of the deep-seated quality of life and well-being issues, such as inadequate housing, over-crowding, and limited chances in life come into the scene again. The only major difference is that many educated young people are involved in the social event in 2019-2020, in contrast to the predominance of poorly educated young people in the 1966 riots.",
