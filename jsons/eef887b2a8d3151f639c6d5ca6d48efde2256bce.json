Clear data about the pandemic's impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data. METHODS European countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day/week were selected (England and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and (RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age-and gender-specific excess mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19. RESULTS Excess mortality was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore, excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries.",

At the moment, data is available for up to the 12 th of April (week 15). In week 11, Italy had high excess mortality, and it has had very high excess since then. Portugal had \"above expected\" mortality in weeks 13 and 14. The Netherlands faced high mortality in week 12 and very high ever since, and England as well. For Wales, week 13 had high mortality, and week 14 very high. Lastly, France had high mortality in week 12, very high in weeks 13 and 14, but no excess this last week. Beyond this qualitative analysis, we found four studies of excess mortality during COVID-19. Switzerland has a mortality surveillance system in place with data from the Federal Statistical Office [8] that estimates 892 excess deaths for those above-65 up to April 12th. Instituto Carlos III in Spain found a 56,5% all-cause mortality excess from March 17 th -April 7 th (13 954 excess deaths), mostly in individuals older than 75 and males [9] . Researchers familiar with the Spanish mortality surveillance system mentioned some concerns about data reliability for the last few days, so it's likely that this may be revised upwards [10] . Cancelli and Foresti found increases in overall mortality in several Italian regions ranging from 4 to 10 times the amount of COVID-19 reported deaths [11] . They conclude that deaths attributed to COVID-19 are underestimated, and end their paper calling for more, better data on the pandemic. Galeotti et al. use a self-titled \"rule of thumb calculation\" pointing to a 1:1 to 1:3 COVID-19 to unexplained excess death count, a number not meant to be interpreted as an epidemiological model, but only as an insight into a potentially disregarded information gap [12] . These last two studies have strong limitations, most of all regarding the estimation of excess deaths, but it's reasonable to assume that their conclusions stand.",

Portugal and France have daily data, which we have decided to adapt into weekly data to have a common data unit and smoothen daily variations that may disturb the analysis. Italy, the Netherlands, and England and Wales already have weekly data. All countries report their weekly mortality differently, with the Netherlands using Monday as the first day of their week, England and Wales using Saturday, and Italy using a first, 11-day week, and 7-day weeks for the rest, regardless of the day of the week (and with one 8-day week for bissextile years). We used England and Wales as a template to adapt Portuguese and French data. Regarding agegroups, all countries report it differently, with under and over-65 as the only age group with comparable data. Thus, we created a dataset with age-specific mortality for under-and over-65 for all 5 countries. We have corrected Italian data for the last week of February, since they have 8-day weeks every bissextile year. We have considered only 7/8 of deaths reported for that week, both for 2016 and 2020. Stratified data from the Netherlands presented an artifact every year-end, which resulted in some years ending with 53 weeks (last one incomplete). For these, data from week 53 was ag-gregated with week 1 (also incomplete) from the following year. Portugal has no data on gender mortality. Our datasets are accessible on GitHub [20] .",

We started our analysis on the day of the first COVID-19 death in each country, naming the first full week after that \"week 1\". We calculated the amount of excess deaths that could be explained by COVID-19, and we also looked at week-to-week trends in total mortality for each country, using \"week 0\" as a baseline to chart a comparative evolution of weekly mortality in each country. Deviation from the expected value from homologue periods (DEV) Mortality is relatively stable across the years for all analyzed datasets. Thus, we calculate the expected mortality using the homologue mean for previous years and adding a standard deviation to account for normal variation. This may lead to an underestimation of excess deaths, as it sets a high threshold. Other authors use a higher threshold (3 z-scores for the Euro-MOMO algorithm, for instance) but usually discount previous periods of excess mortality.",

For most countries, week 1 is still close to normal, but week 2 starts showing increases in all-cause mortality. Largest week-on-week (WoW) increases happen on week 2 in Portugal and Italy, week 3 in the Netherlands, and week 4 in England and Wales. In France, the largest increase in mortality WoW happens on week 7. Table 2 presents data on excess deaths with breakdown by age and gender when possible, alongside the amount of deaths attributed to COVID-19, according to the DEV method. We found excess deaths in all studied countries. Italy stands out from the rest for its large excess mortality, almost doubling the upper limit of expected deaths. The percentage of excess deaths explained by COVID-19 in weeks of increased mortality varies substantially, from almost all excess deaths (England and Wales, 92.9%) to less than half (Netherlands, 46.1%). Age and gender differences were found, with excess mortality predominantly in elderly males, and with Portugal and France showing no excess mortality in under-65 populations. Table 3 presents data on excess deaths with breakdown by age and gender according to the RSTS method. Results are similar to the DEV method. Excess mortality can be observed in all 4 countries, ranging from single digit increases for France and Portugal to double digit increases in England and Wales and the Netherlands. As with the DEV method, we find excess mortality happens mostly in males over 65. Both France and Portugal present no excess deaths for under-65.",

Euro-MOMO alerts for excess mortality in 2020 in Portugal (above normal (AN) in week 1 and 2, and high excess (HE) mortality in week 3), in England and Wales (AN in week 1), in the Netherlands (AN in week 2) and in Italy (AN in week 3). Our DEV method returns no excess mortality for any of these weeks. Our RSTS method reports increased mortality for week 3 in England and Wales, but no further periods of excess mortality.
