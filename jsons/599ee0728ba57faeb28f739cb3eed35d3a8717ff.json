Readers will also learn that GIS adoption by hospital marketers and planners in the United States accelerated rapidly after the 1970, when US Census data became relatively freely available in digital form. The importance of the legendary work of the Dartmouth Health Care Atlas Project and its founder Jack Wennberg. In areas where high GIS adoption rates occurred, such as in public health, we feature key applications such as immunization management, disease tracking, outbreak analysis, disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, emergency preparedness and response, community health assessment, environmental health, chronic disease prevention, and animal and veterinary health. The final Sect. 29 .5 describes how GIS education has expanded across the academic fields of public health, healthcare administration, and social services. It is pointed out that the material presented in this chapter is not intended to be an exhaustive examination of the history of GIS, but rather, a brief introduction and overview which will generate further interest and self-discovery. The increasing utilization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology over the past several decades has transformed health and human services (HHS) and given new eyes to public health professionals, researchers, and hospital and health system employees -as well as the public they serve.
