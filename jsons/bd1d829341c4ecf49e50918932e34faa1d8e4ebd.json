Besides, the comfort properties of respirators are of great importance, which may impact on healthcare workers' compliance of wearing respirators. However, protective masks available generally lack reasonable comfort for wearers.",

An N95 respirator with an SAP pad could rapidly absorb the sweat, water vapor, and exhaled splutter but the SAP pad itself gets wet very slowly, which greatly reduced the humidity of respirators while wearing, leading to longer life cycle and improved comfort of respirators 2 : 1) get an incontinence pad and peel off its waterproof film to get the absorbent layer containing SAP (SAP pad); 2) cut the SAP pad into proper shape and size that fit the respirator well; 3) place the SAP pad on the inside of a respirator (Figure 1 ). From our experience, a single SAP pad is thin enough to maintain the protectivity of respirators and can be used much longer (> 4 hours) without getting wet or dropping off, and mildly decrease the air permeability, compared with other solutions like using a paper towel or cotton pad.
