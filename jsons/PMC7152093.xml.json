The 1980s saw an increase in rheumatic fever cases in the Rocky Mountain states of the USA, along with an apparent resurgence in severe Group A Streptococcus disease in industrialized countries. The resultant increased attention paid to Group A Streptococcus disease in recent years has also brought to focus the continuing high burden of Group A Streptococcus disease in developing countries, particularly those in tropical regions [3].",

Group A Streptococcus strains belonging to emm types 1 and 3, in particular, have been implicated in this rise. Most cases of severe invasive Group A Streptococcus disease are sporadic, but secondary cases and case clusters have been reported.

Preceding viral infection, in particular with varicella or influenza A, has been implicated as a frequent antecedent to invasive infection. The skin and throat are the major portals for entry, after which Group A Streptococcus evades host defenses by elaborating a number of virulence factors, chief of which is M protein that extends as hair-like filaments from the cell surface.

Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a sandpaper-like texture to the skin. Desquamation of the fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue).

Historically, outbreaks of Group A Streptococcus pneumonia were reported among previously healthy adults, although more recent reports have described the highest risk amongst the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions; infection in these individuals is often associated with high case fatality [9]. A viral prodrome is often reported, although the onset of fever, chest pain and dyspnea is characteristically rapid. Group A Streptococcus pneumonia may be necrotizing with pleural effusions frequently present early and early complications include lung abscess formation, mediastinitis and pericarditis. Group A Streptococcus is an uncommon cause of meningitis in children and adults, with most reports arising in individuals with a pre-existing focus of Group A Streptococcus infection (e.g. pharyngitis, otitis media) or with other risk factors (e.g. skull defect or post-cranial surgery) [10]. Puerperal sepsis caused by Group A Streptococcus was a frequent cause of death in the pre-antibiotic era with outbreaks resulting from nosocomial transmission. A study in four tropical developing countries (Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, The Gambia and The Philippines) during the 1990s found that Group A Streptococcus was one of the three leading causes of bacteremia in children aged <90 days, suggesting that Group A Streptococcus puerperal sepsis and septic abortion remain common in less developed, tropical countries [11]. Unlike Group B Streptococcus, Group A Streptococcus more commonly affects the mother than the infant, manifesting as post-partum endometritis, peritonitis, septic thrombophlebitis or bacteremia without focus [12].

Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever in the absence of other features. Severe or recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever may result in progressive damage to the mitral valve (and sometimes the aortic valve) resulting in incompetence and progressive heart failure (rheumatic heart disease). Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur 1\u20132 weeks after throat infection or a few weeks after Group A Streptococcus skin infection. The features are hematuria (microscopic or gross), edema (which may be most evident peri-orbitally) and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated by encephalopathy. The illness is generally benign in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a term used to describe some children with tic or obsessive compulsive disorders in whom symptoms appear to develop or worsen following Group A Streptococcus infection. The existence of PANDAS is controversial [14]. Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from acute rheumatic fever by affecting a range of smaller joints, being relatively resistant to anti-inflammatory treatment and not being associated with carditis, although cases of acute rheumatic fever have been mis-diagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis 15, 16.",
