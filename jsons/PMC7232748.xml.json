            "text": "A novel coronavirus, called SARS\u2010coronavirus or SARS\u2010CoV, has been proved to be the cause of SARS. The coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) are members of a family of large, enveloped, positive\u2010stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal host cells [7]. There are three groups of coronaviruses; groups I and II contain mammalian viruses, while group III contains only avian viruses. The viruses are associated with a variety of diseases in humans and domestic animals, including gastroenteritis and diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Many researchers have analyzed the phylogeny of SARS\u2010CoV and concluded that it is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and forms a distinct group (group IV) within the genus Coronavirus [7, 8]. At the time this paper was written, there were 12 strains of SARS\u2010CoV complete genome sequences available from GenBank [7, 8, 9]. Among these genomes, six have been annotated manually, and the remaining six have not been annotated yet. The genomic organization of SARS\u2010CoV is that of a typical coronavirus, with the order of the characteristic genes being replicase [rep], spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], nucleocapsid [N] from the 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032 terminus. SARS\u2010CoV also encodes a number of non\u2010structural proteins located between S and E, between M and N, or downstream of N with unknown functions. We have developed a coronavirus\u2010specific gene\u2010finding system ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 [10], which is especially suitable for gene recognition in SARS\u2010CoV genomes. The software has the advantages of simplicity, reliability, high accuracy and quickness and can be obtained freely at the website http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/. The system ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 has been run for each of the 12 SARS\u2010CoV genomes. In addition to the polyprotein chains Orf1a and Orf1b and the four genes encoding the major structural proteins, S, E, M and N, respectively, ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 also predicts five to six putative proteins between 39 and 274 amino acids in length, with unknown functions in SARS\u2010CoV genomes. However, the cleavage sites of viral proteinase in replicases are not predicted in ZCURVE_CoV 1.0.",

Polyproteins ORF1a and ORF1b are connected by a ribosomal frameshift site, which is believed to occur at the conserved \u2018slippery sequence\u2019, UUUAAAC. It results in the translation of an ORF1a protein and a carboxyl\u2010extended ORF1ab frameshift protein, which are also known as replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab [11]. The ORF1a and ORF1ab translation products are polyprotein precursors, which are cleaved by viral proteinases, resulting in a minimum of 13 non\u2010structural proteins, including a 3C\u2010like proteinase, an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, an ATPase/helicase and other function\u2010unknown non\u2010structural proteins [11]. These proteins in turn are responsible for replicating the viral genome as well as generating nested transcripts that are used in the synthesis of viral proteins. In this paper, all the putative non\u2010structural proteins resulting from the cleavage by viral proteinases in the polyproteins are precisely predicted using ZCURVE_CoV 2.0.",

These coronaviruses include avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (genbank:NC_001451), bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (genbank:NC_003045), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV\u2010229E) (genbank:NC_002645), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (genbank:NC_001846), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (genbank:NC_003436), SARS coronavirus TOR2 (TOR2) (genbank:NC_004718) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (genbank:NC_002306). The above genomes have been annotated by NCBI and the sequences of mature peptides are available. According to the annotation, a total of 77 sites cleaved by the 3C\u2010like proteinase and 17 sites cleaved by the papain\u2010like proteinase were extracted from the above seven genomes. Octapeptides cleaved by the 3C\u2010like proteinase and 12\u2010mer peptides cleaved by the papain\u2010like proteinase were used to train the corresponding positional weight matrix (PWM) [12]. The cleavage site is at the center of the octapeptide or 12\u2010mer peptide. The length distribution of non\u2010structural proteins within ORF1ab was also derived from the annotated genomes. At the time this paper was written, there were 24 complete sequences of coronavirus genomes available in the GenBank database, of which 12 are SARS\u2010CoVs and 12 are other groups of coronaviruses. The former comprises SARS\u2010CoV TOR2 (genbank:NC_004718), Urbani (genbank:AY278741), HKU\u201039849 (genbank:AY278491), CUHK\u2010W1 (genbank:AY278554), BJ01 (genbank:AY278488), CUHK\u2010Su10 (genbank:AY282752), SIN2500 (genbank:AY283794), SIN2748 (genbank:AY283797), SIN2679 (genbank:AY283796), SIN2774 (genbank:AY283798), SIN2677 (genbank:AY283795) and TW1 (genbank:AY291451), whereas the latter comprises IBV (genbank:NC_001451), BCoV (genbank:NC_003045), bovine coronavirus strain Mebus (BCoVM) (genbank:U00735), bovine coronavirus isolate BCoV\u2010LUN (BCoVL) (genbank:AF391542), bovine coronavirus strain Quebec (BCoVQ) (genbank:AF220295), HCoV\u2010229E (genbank:NC_002645), MHV (genbank:NC_001846), murine hepatitis virus strain ML\u201010 (MHVM) (genbank:AF208067), murine hepatitis virus strain 2 (MHV2) (genbank:AF201929), murine hepatitis virus strain Penn 97\u20101 (MHVP) (genbank:AF208066), PEDV (genbank:NC_003436) and TGEV (genbank:NC_002306).",

The lengths of all the non\u2010structural proteins cleaved by the 3C\u2010like proteinase within polyprotein 1ab are listed in Table 1\n, while the lengths for the non\u2010structural proteins cleaved by the papain\u2010like proteinase are listed in Table 2\n. The average length and standard deviation for each kind of non\u2010structural proteins are calculated. As shown in Table 1, Table 2, the lengths of the non\u2010structural proteins cleaved by the 3C\u2010like proteinase are highly conserved, while the lengths and the number of the papain\u2010like cysteine proteinase cleavage products (abbreviated as PCP CP) appear to be irregular. Since the NCBI annotations are not always correct, the annotations of cleavage products of the papain\u2010like proteinase may be incomplete. It is observed that the size of the annotated PCP CP3 of SARS\u2010CoV, MHV and IBV is approximately the sum of the sizes of PCP CP3 and PCP CP4 of other mammalian coronaviruses listed in Table 2. Therefore, the PCP CP3 of SARS\u2010CoV, MHV and IBV may be further cleaved, i.e. it is possible that another papain\u2010like proteinase cleavage site is present in the PCP CP3 of SARS\u2010CoV, MHV and IBV. Based on the above analysis, a cleavage model of the papain\u2010like proteinase is presented schematically in Fig. 1\n. According to this model, all coronaviruses have four non\u2010structural proteins cleaved by the papain\u2010like proteinase. Consequently, the cleavage products of the papain\u2010like proteinase predicted by this model show the conservation in both their length and number. The average length and standard deviation for each papain\u2010like proteinase cleavage product are estimated based on the genomes of BCoV, HCoV\u2010229E, TGEV and PEDV, in which four of the papain\u2010like proteinase cleavage products are annotated (see Table 2). Fig. 2A,B\nshows the conservation sites cleaved by the 3C\u2010like proteinase and papain\u2010like proteinase, respectively. It can be seen that both the 3C\u2010like proteinase and papain\u2010like proteinase have conserved cleavage sites. The same arrangement order of the cleavage products in polyprotein 1ab, similar sizes of non\u2010structural proteins and the conserved residues in the cleavable peptides form the basis of the present algorithm to predict cleavage sites of polyproteins. Here, the method is described briefly as follows.",

Starting from the C\u2010terminus of the predicted ORF1ab polyprotein, the candidate cleavage site of nsp13 is searched within a particular region using the sliding\u2010window technique. The distance between the scanning region center and the C\u2010terminus of polyprotein 1ab should be equal to the average length of nsp13. Denoting the center position by c, a window with an octapeptide size slides from the positions c\u22123\u03b4 to c+3\u03b4, where \u03b4 is the standard deviation of the length distribution for nsp13 (see Table 1).

Once the cleavage site of nsp12|13 is determined, the next cleavage site to be predicted is nsp11|12, then nsp10|11, and so forth until nsp1|2. Generally, if the site of nspk|(k+1) is determined, the next target is to predict the site of nsp(k\u22121)|k, where k=12, 11, \u2026, 2, but k\u22608 (see the explanation below). For clarity, take k=6 as an example, where the site of nsp6|7 is known. First, the center position and the sliding window used for identifying the site of nsp5|6 need to be determined. The center position c is situated upstream of the site of nsp6|7. The distance between the center position c and the site of nsp6|7 should be equal to \n6, which is the average length of nsp6. In Table 1, we find \n6=110 aa and the standard deviation \u03b4 of the length distribution for nsp6 is 1.6. A window with an octapeptide size thus slides from the position c\u22123\u03b4\u2248c\u22125 to c+3\u03b4\u2248c+5. Second, the site with the highest score is predicted to be the candidate site of nsp5|6. Note that in some cases the scores may be zero because of the limited training samples. In this case, a very small quantity (0.001) is assigned to the zero elements in the positional weight matrix. Also note that the nsp7|8 site is cleaved in polyprotein 1a, while the nsp7|9 site is cleaved in polyprotein 1ab. Therefore, the cleavage sites of nsp7|8 and nsp7|9 are in fact the same, leading to the result of k\u22608. Furthermore, if the following two conditions are satisfied, besides the site with the maximum score, the site with the second maximum score is also taken into account: (i) Gln and Leu are found at the P1 and P2 positions, respectively; (ii) the distance between the two sites is less than five amino acid residues. This procedure considers the prediction of two adjacent cleavage sites in the scanning window. Consequently, two alternative cleavage sites annotated by NCBI are also found in the genomes of MHV and BCoV. Note that such cases occur rarely in the genomes studied.",

Coronaviruses encode a chymotrypsin\u2010like proteinase, 3C\u2010like proteinase, which is analogous to the main picornaviral proteinase, 3C proteinase [11]. As mentioned above, the cleavage sites of the 3C\u2010like proteinase are highly conserved. As shown in Fig. 2A, the P1 position of the peptide sequence is exclusively occupied by Gln. Leu is dominant at the P2 position (more than 75%) and Val, Ser, Thr and Pro are clearly favored at the P4 position. At the P1\u2032 position, small, aliphatic residues (Ser, Ala, Asn, Gly and Cys) are found, of which the content of Ser is more than 50%. There are no highly favored residues at the P3, P2\u2032, P3\u2032 and P4\u2032 positions. The length distributions of each of the 11 non\u2010structural proteins cleaved by the 3C\u2010like proteinase in the annotated genomes are listed in Table 1. Of these non\u2010structural proteins, nsp2 is the putative 3C\u2010like proteinase; nsp3 contains a hydrophobic domain; nsp7 is known as a growth\u2010factor\u2010like protein; nsp9 is the putative RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase; nsp10 contains a metal ion\u2010binding domain and NTPase/helicase domain. Recently the mRNA cap\u20101 methyltransferase function has been assigned to nsp13 [13]. The functions of other non\u2010structural proteins are unknown. Moreover, coronaviruses also encode one (group III) or two (groups I and II) papain\u2010like proteinases, which are analogous to the foot and mouth disease virus leader proteinase. SARS\u2010CoV appears to contain only one papain\u2010like proteinase domain in the predicted gene product of ORF1a [7]. For the papain\u2010like proteinase, the cleavage sites are also conserved, but not as conserved as those of the 3C\u2010like proteinase. Gly and Ala are found at the P1 position and Gly accounts for more than 75%. At the P2 and P1\u2032 positions, Gly is also the dominant residue, which accounts for more than 45% and 50%, respectively. No residues exceed 40% at other positions.

Although all the SARS genomes have been annotated by in silico analysis so far, some annotations for other coronaviruses, such as IBV, MHV and HCoV\u2010229E, are supported by experimental evidence [11]. The jack\u2010knife (leave\u2010one\u2010out) test has been performed here to ensure the validation of the prediction results for the cleavage sites of the 3C\u2010like proteinase. By the jack\u2010knife test, each genome out of the seven genomes under study is singled out in turn, and used as a testing genome. The remaining six genomes are used as the training set. Based on the data derived from the six training genomes, the cleavage sites of the 3C\u2010like proteinase in the testing genome are predicted and evaluated. The jack\u2010knife test was finished by repeating the above procedure seven times. Consequently, the predicted results by the jack\u2010knife test are found to be as good as those by a self\u2010consistency test mentioned previously, suggesting that the prediction results are reliable.",

The coronavirus \u22121 frameshift site [14] is believed to occur at the \u2018slippery sequence\u2019, UUUAAAC. This assumption has been supported by experimental evidence [15]. But the annotated frameshift sites are not always consistent with this pattern, as in the case of PEDV, whose frameshift site lies upstream of the UUUAAAC sequence according to the annotation. This may be due to the questionable annotation. For example, the genomes of MHV and BCoV were originally annotated by the authors as the ones having a non\u2010standard frameshift site, however, these conclusions were then corrected by the re\u2010annotations of NCBI as the ones having standard frameshift sites. In light of this, we adopt UUUAAAC as the standard slippery sequence.",

The tedious calculations for deriving the cutoff value can be avoided by restricting the sizes of the scanning regions and only selecting the site with the maximum score within this region. The annotated cleavage sites often correspond to the highest scores measured by the PWM method. However, the sites scored high by the PWM method do not always correspond to the cleavage sites and vice versa. Restricting the scanning regions for each of the cleavage sites is more efficient to reduce the false positive prediction rate. For the prediction of the 3C\u2010like proteinase cleavage sites, there are only two conflicts between the predicted results and the annotations, which are marked in Table 3. The first conflict lies in the locations of non\u2010structural proteins downstream of nsp9 in TGEV, which may be due to the problematic annotation. The length of amino acid sequences for ORF 1ab (315\u201320 368 bp) should be 6684 aa, instead of 6685 aa, which is annotated by NCBI. The questionable additional insertion of an amino acid residue in nsp9 causes one conflict of location errors. The second is caused by a non\u2010standard frameshift site in PEDV, which causes the difference of five amino acid residues between the non\u2010standard frameshift site and the standard frameshift site. For this reason, the octapeptide predicted by the present method is SIMQ|STDM instead of the annotated SIMQ|STDY.",
