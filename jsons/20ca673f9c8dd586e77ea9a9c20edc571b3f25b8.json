HHS is a multidisciplinary service operating 7 days a week that can be directly activated by hospital wards to allow early and supported discharge from hospital. Four doctors and 14 nurses operate 7 days a week and look after 25 patients a day, on average. The HHS provides substitutive hospital-at-home care in a ''clinical unit'' model. Several examinations and treatments can be carried out at home, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, spirometry, pulse oximetry, ultrasonographic investigations, placement of peripherally inserted central catheters, oxygen and other respiratory therapies, intravenous fluids and drugs, blood transfusions, surgical treatment of pressure ulcers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) .",

Second, a negative nasopharyngeal swab does not exclude COVID-19 infection if there is a high clinical suspicion. Third, although these frail older patients have reduced chances to survive this infection, adequate supportive measures may improve survival even without the use of targeted therapies of uncertain and unproven benefit. Some of these patients may die for final worsening of general health status during Covid-19 infection rather than for the infection itself. Indeed, in frail, bedridden patients with dementia, poor nutrition, dehydration and other clinical complications occur commonly during even mild infective illnesses, and are well recognized risk factors for accelerated worsening health status and death, without the provision of adequate supportive measures. Hopefully, immediate activation of such supportive measures in infected patients with mild disease and without indications for hospital admission might reduce the high mortality rates for Covid-19 infection which are increasingly reported from most long term facilities.",
