            "text": "Background Laboratory diagnosis of Hepatozoon canis infection is tedious, especially in chronic and/or latent infections. Purpose The study was planned to develop a simple read out loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting a partial 18S rRNA gene of H. canis with naked eye visualisation of LAMP products. Methods A LAMP assay was employed to assess the DNA amplification by adding SYBR Green I dye for naked eye inspection of DNA accumulating in reaction tubes. Positive amplification was read through observation of change in colour of reaction mixture following addition of dye. The visual results were further verified with those of agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA of other haemoparasites of dog viz. Babesia vogeli, B. gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis and Trypanosoma evansi along with no-template control were used to determine the specificity of assay. Results Among the 109 blood samples presented at Small Animal Clinics, Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, Punjab (India) tested, 39 revealed colour change from orange to green indicating positive reaction while 70 were negative as revealed by no colour change. The results of visual inspection were comparable to those obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis. The LAMP primers specifically amplified H. canis DNA, whereas no amplification was detected in DNA samples of other haemoparasites and no-template control revealing specificity of the assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of visual LAMP assay with respect to microscopy in detection of H. canis varied from 100% (15.81-100.00%) and 65.42% (55.61-74.35%), respectively. Conclusion The present investigation has developed a specific and rapid LAMP assay for the detection of H. canis, using SYBR Green I dye, which has practical applications for the screening of field samples.",

The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of visual LAMP assay with respect to microscopy in detection of H. canis varied from 100% (15.81-100.00%) and 65.42% (55.61-74.35%), respectively. In the present study the LAMP assay seemed to be more sensitive than microscopy as those samples of blood (n = 37) which were negative in microscopy were also amplified for the presence of parasite DNA.",

In this regard, the monitoring may be done by use of fluorescent dyes viz. SYBR Green I. In the presence of sufficient amount of double stranded DNA, the color of SYBR ",

Furthermore, the employment of SYBR Green I lead to increased sensitivity when compared with visual turbidity measurements as per Zhang et al. [20] and Soli et al. [21] . In practice, the visual inspection for amplification is performed through observation of color change by adding 1 \u03bcL of SYBR Green I to the tube and the result of the LAMP reaction can be monitored by the naked eye at the end point [20] [21] [22] [23] . Although, the risk of contamination of amplicons may increase because of the need to open the reaction tubes to add the dye, however, opening the reaction tube after amplification with care to prevent carry-over contamination can be done to minimize the risk. On the other hand, agarose gel electrophoresis is a conventional method for monitoring the LAMP amplicons directly [13, 18, 19, 24] , and even serves as a \"gold standard\" methodology in many situations. The results are interpreted as appearance of ladder-like banding in positive reaction tube under ultraviolet (UV) gel imaging analysis system. However, ethidium bromide, used in gel electrophoresis, may act as mutagen, carcinogen, or teratogen, though this depends on the organism exposed and the circumstances of exposure [25] . Additionally, the method possesses a risk of cross-contamination and also relatively long turnaround times [26] . Also, the requirement for electrophoresis apparatus and UV detection limits the suitability for field applications.",

Furthermore, the LAMP assay can be employed as a simple read out technology (naked eye visualisation of LAMP products) in the field for routine examination, where sophisticated and high-end equipments are not feasible.",
