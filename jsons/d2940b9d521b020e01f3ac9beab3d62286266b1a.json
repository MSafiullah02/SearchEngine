After two outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from March-June 2003, we reviewed the unexpected role and responsibilities of pharmacists during these two crises, and present strategies for better crisis preparedness. Methods and Results. Pharmacists were actively involved in battling the SARS crises. After conducting extensive literature searches and evaluations, pharmacists prepared administration and dosing guidelines for the two investigational drugs, ribavirin and interferon alfacon-1, that were being used to treat the syndrome. They provided direct patient care under modified conditions. They revised drug distribution procedures and developed new ones to meet more stringent infection-control standards. Collaborative teamwork with key stakeholders was important in accomplishing tasks in an efficient and timely manner. Regular communication with health care staff took place internally and externally. Education and updated information for pharmacists was crucial. Conclusion. Pharmacists can play a vital role during crises in the areas of drug distribution, drug information, and direct patient care. Collaborative teamwork and close communication are keys to success. Pharmacists must be proactive and take a leadership role in assuming pharmacy-related responsibilities. By evaluating what worked and what didn't, pharmacists can develop procedures for future crises requiring pharmacy support.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has emerged as a new infectious disease that created a global public health emergency in 2003. The disease was first manifested in humans in China in November 2002 but subsequently spread to many countries. 1, 2 In Canada, most of the SARS cases occurred in the city of Toronto and the neighboring greater Toronto area. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is highly transmissible, putting close family members and people working in the health care environment at particular risk. In several countries and in Toronto, most cases occurred through nosocomial transmission. [1] [2] [3] The etiologic cause of SARS was identified as a coronavirus, now referred to as the SARS-associated coronavirus. [4] [5] [6] Clinically, SARS presents as a flu-like illness typically characterized by fever, nonproductive cough, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, and laboratory and radiologic chest abnormalities. 3, [7] [8] [9] The SARS incubation period is usually 3-10 days, and the illness has been associated with a mortality rate of 6.5%-30%. Several factors, such as age over 60 years, comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, admission to an intensive care unit, and need for mechanical ventilation, predict a poor clinical outcome. 3, [7] [8] [9] Optimal therapy for SARS remains to be established. Initially, treatment consisted of a super-broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. This evolved to primarily supportive management, such as corticosteroids for worsening respiratory function. Antibiotics still are administered first to cover for community-acquired pneumonia until this cause is ruled out.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 250, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 609, "end": 612, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 613, "end": 616, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 734, "end": 737, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 738, "end": 741, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 742, "end": 745, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 928, "end": 930, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 931, "end": 934, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 935, "end": 938, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 939, "end": 942, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1263, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1267, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1271, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1275, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, initially was used because of its broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses, such as the coronaviruses. 10 Because of considerable toxicity, lack of significant impact on clinical outcome, and poor in vitro antiviral activity, the use of ribavirin was abandoned. 1, 3 Subsequently, an engineered second-generation cytokine, interferon alfacon-1, was used empirically based on its antiviral and antiinflammatory effects. 1, 11 Preliminary results from its use in a small number of patients recently were published. 12 Although much has been learned about SARS, many questions about its cause, transmission, and treatment remain to be answered through further research.

This was achieved by performing extensive literature searches, communicating directly with the drug manufacturer, and obtaining unpublished pharmacokinetic data from the manufacturer. Obtaining documentation of communication from the drug manufacturer was important for reference and liability reasons. In addition, the pharmacists collaborated and shared information with pharmacy colleagues at other institutions who were also managing patients with SARS. Finally, a patient information sheet for ribavirin was developed in view of the underlying teratogenic and embryotoxic properties of the drug. 10 At the start of the first SARS crisis, a SARS drug kit was created and stored in the hospital's emergency department. The kit provided readily accessible information on dosing of the various antimicrobial agents, guidelines on the preparation and administration of intravenous and oral ribavirin in patients with either normal or impaired renal function, a patient information sheet about ribavirin, and information about the SARS management algorithm.
