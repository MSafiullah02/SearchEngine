If the association between COVID-19 and OTD is not recognized, the diagnosis may be missed. However, while a large proportion of COVID-19 patients had OTD, [1] [2] [3] the actual specificity as a criterion for screening suspected COVID-19 cases is unknown, as other viral infections may also cause OTD. Other studies have reported patients presenting with acute anosmia with or without upper respiratory tract symptoms, [4, 5] but not all patients were tested for COVID-19 [4] . Additionally, information on OTD in Asian cohorts is lacking [1] . In Singapore, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in end-January 2020. At our institution, the largest acute hospital in Singapore, from end-March 2020 all new admissions were screened for self-reported OTD at emergency department (ED) triage. All patients reporting new-onset OTD were admitted to exclude COVID-19. We report our experience using self-reported OTD as a screening criterion for suspected COVID-19.",

Suspect case criteria for COVID-19 were defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and suspicious epidemiological links or travel history; or new-onset OTD. Testing was not limited to hospitalised inpatients; as part of the national strategy of containment, all patients who fulfilled suspect case criteria for COVID-19 were tested via real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) of oropharyngeal swabs, even if hospitalization was not otherwise required. Inpatient, if patients had respiratory symptoms and a viral prodrome, or OTD, oropharyngeal specimens were also tested for a routine panel of respiratory viruses. As this study was based on aggregated surveillance data, ethics approval was not required under our hospital's Institutional Review Board guidelines.",
