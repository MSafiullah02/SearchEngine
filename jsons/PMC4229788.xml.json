Inherited and acquired variability in host immune responses may influence susceptibility and outcome of IAV infection, although these factors remain largely unknown [2-4].",

Adaptive immune responses, which are needed for ultimate viral clearance, take several days to develop. Therefore, components of the innate immunity that are able to neutralize IAV infection with minor inflammation may be crucial for host defense in the first few days after infection. Different soluble pattern-recognition molecules of the innate immunity can neutralize IAV infection. Several secreted human C-type lectins of the collectin family, the serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL), the pulmonary surfactant proteins (SP) \u2013A1, \u2013A2, and \u2013D, and collectin 11 (CL-11, alias collectin kidney 1, CL-K1) may neutralize IAV infectivity in vitro[5-8]. Among these collectins, the SPs have been shown to exert an important role against IAV infection in animal models: mice lacking SP-A or SP-D have increased susceptibility to IAV infection, and their role seem to depend on IAV strains, particularly pandemic versus seasonal strains [9-14]. In addition, variability at the collectin genes, MBL2 (Ensembl: ENSG00000165471), SFTPA1 (Ensembl: ENSG00000122852), SFTPA2 (Ensembl: ENSG00000185303), and SFTPD (Ensembl: ENSG00000133661) have been found to be associated with susceptibility to and/or severity of several bacterial and viral infectious diseases [6,15].",

By contrast, glycosylation of hemagglutinins is important in determining sensitivity of IAV to recognition by collectins [7,27]. SP-D and MBL bind to mannose-rich glycans on the hemagglutinins and neuraminidase glycoproteins of IAV, agglutinating viral particles and inhibiting infectivity and neuraminidase activity [7]. Among the known human collectins, SP-D has the strongest in vitro capability of aggregating and neutralizing activity of IAV [7,12,27]. Hemagglutinins from all available strains of pandemic influenza viruses show significantly lower glycosylation sites compared with seasonal strains; and pandemic viruses, particularly H1N1pdm, were found to be resistant to the antiviral activities of SP-D, MBL, and the pentraxin PTX3 [7,13,27]. We have not observed any association with severity when deficient-, low-, or high-MBL producer genotypes and SFTPD SNPs or haplotypes were compared (data not shown). Interestingly, SP-A binding to hemagglutinins and SP-A-dependent IAV neutralization in vitro are not influenced by the extent of hemagglutinins glycosylation. SP-A is slightly more effective than SP-D at neutralizing nonglycosylated IAV strains, and it neutralizes IAV strains resistant to SP-D [12].",

Binding of the carbohydrate-binding recognition domains (CRDs) to signal-inhibitory regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1) on alveolar macrophages suppresses NF-\u03baB activation and inflammation, allowing the healthy lung to remain in a quiescent state. SP-A and SP-D can also inhibit inflammation, through the CRD, blocking Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Pulmonary clearance of IAV was reduced, and pulmonary inflammation and severity were increased in Sftpa-/-mice compared with wild-type mice [10,11]. SP-A was also found to disturb the host inflammatory response to IAV infection in mouse models without directly influencing viral growth and spread, and even without demonstrable viral binding, at least when the virus was resistant to neutralization by SP-D [9]. Insufficient amounts of surfactant, particularly SP-A, have been observed in prematurely born infants with respiratory distress syndrome (pRDS). The haplotype 1A0 or SFTPA1-SFTPA2 haplotypes containing 1A0 have been repeatedly associated with the development of pRDS, whereas SP haplotypes containing 1A1 were found to be protective against that condition [5,15]. These findings parallel those observed in our study, suggesting that 1A0 and 1A1 might influence the inflammatory response and the severity of H1N1pdm infection without binding to IAV.",

Residue 9 (rs1059046, T9N) is located in the signal peptide, and it is unknown whether this variant may affect the protein. It is, however, worth noting that haplotypes 1A0 and 1A1 differ precisely at residues 9 and 223. A role of SNPs at regulatory regions in haplotypes 1A0 and 1A1 in translation and/or RNA stability of SFTPA2 cannot be ruled out [5,15]. Interestingly, SP-A2 1A1 variants were shown to have a lower activity for enhancement of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophage-derived THP-1 cells than other variants, such as 1A and 1A0, particularly after oxidative stress [28,29].
