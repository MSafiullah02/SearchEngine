On the other hand, inflammation/innate and acquired immunity, when efficiently activated against pathogens, provide an immediate and adaptive response with the clearance of pathogens and the development of immunological memory. The study of the communication between CNS and immune systems continued to show evidence and to define the many interactions that occur among the neural, neuroendocrine and immune systems by bidirectional routes (Nagy and Berczi, 1978, Besedovsky et al., 1981, McCann et al., 1994, Berczi et al., 1998).",

The emerging concept is that a critical balance exists between hormones [Growth Hormone (GH), Prolactin (PRL), Glucocorticoids (GCs), catecolamin, insulin)] and pro-inflammatory cytokines [mainly Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF\u03b1)] involving nervous, endocrine, immune organs (like the thymus) and so called \u201ctarget\u201d tissues (i.e. adipose and muscle tissue). This balance can influence the immune response and, consequently, the course of infection/severity of the disease as well as body growth, during inflammatory states. Data on the cellular and molecular aspects has characterized, the bidirectional interactions between hormone\u2013hormone as well as cytokine\u2013hormone at the receptor level. For example, PRL and GH counteract the catabolic and immunesuppressive functions of GCs and these impair the action of GH, PRL and IGF-1, GCs inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytokines induces GCs, GH/IGF-1 and insulin resistance, etc. (Kelley et al., 2007).",

Certainly, despite increasing progress in animal immunology, there is still much to understand on how exogenous and/or endogenous factors (management practices, environmental stressors, nutritional factors) can influence the development and the activation of immune responses in terms of functional efficiency. In intensive animal husbandry, neonates are highly sensitive to various stressors such as weaning, mixing, fighting for dominance and shipping, and stressors have been shown to negatively affect the development and efficiency of immunity, with an increased risk for infectious diseases (Hicks et al., 1998, Deguchi and Akuzawa, 1998, de Groot et al., 2001, Kanitz et al., 2002, Tuchscherer et al., 2002).",

Early recognition of pathogens is the key event in the initiation of an innate immune response; innate immune cells are able to recognize pathogens by receptors that function as \u201cdanger signals\u201d and activate an immediate and constant response. The pathogen recognition by innate immune cells occurs by means of Pattern Recognition Receptors (surface, humoral and cytoplasmatic PRRs) binding Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMPs). A major pathway of pathogen recognition is based on the TOLL-like Receptors (TLRs) expression on the surface of innate and inflammatory cells [neutrophils, macrophages, endothelial cells, Natural Killer (NKs) cells, Dendritic Cells (DCs)]. Different bacterial molecules are recognized by TLRs, particularly by TLR2 (peptidoglycan and lipotheicoic acid), TLR5 (flagellin), TLR9 (bacterial CpG) and TLR11 (uropathogenic bacteria). In Gram-negative bacterial infections, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is released during host-mediated bacteriolysis: LPS complexes with host LPS binding protein, and soluble CD14, or membrane-bound CD14 found on the surfaces of macrophages and dendritic cells. This complex is recognized by TLR4, present on the cell membrane. TLR4 ligation leads to the induction of the inflammatory response characterized by the release of the pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factory (MIF). During viral infection a role for TLRs in triggering the adaptive response has been established after the discovery of specific TLRs responsive to viral molecules (nucleic acids and envelope proteins). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a viral PAMP generated during virus replication, binds and activates TLR3 and TLR9 recognizes CpG motifs of viral DNA. Moreover, single-stranded viral RNA (ssRNA), genomic material from many different viruses, triggers the activation of TLR7 and TLR8 (for a more detailed review on TLR-mediated pathogen recognition the reader is referred to Werling et al., 2006, Werling and Coffey, 2007).",

Cytokines and TLR-mediated cell activation also induce the expression of selectins, cytokine and chemokine receptors and integrins on the endothelial surface, orchestrating the recruitment of circulating leucocytes (neutrophils, monocytes and NK) and the activation of tissue stromal cells and tissue-resident innate cells such as immature DCs, macrophages, \u03b3/\u03b4 lymphocytes and mast-cells (Della Chiesa et al., 2005).",

Moreover, strict regulation also occurs to prevent overactivation of inflammation and immune-mediated tissue damage (Sternberg, 2006). This is even more crucial in the presence of an overproduction of cytokines during inflammation/infection. It is likely that, if a counterbalance does not occur, some diseases (uncontrolled inflammation, catabolic disease, autoimmune phenomena, psychiatric disorders) may develop (Schiepers et al., 2005, Mocchegiani et al., 2006, Elenkov, 2008).",

IL-6 not only elicits the APR but also promotes acquired cell-mediated and humoral response such as B-cell differentiation, immunoglobulin production and T cell activation (Thacker, 2005, Maggio et al., 2006). Furthermore, evidence has suggested that IL-6 stimulates the development of Th2 cells (Rincon et al., 1997). It has been demonstrated that IL-6 shifts the Th1/Th2 balance of an immune response towards Th2 in two independent ways, by promoting early IL-4 expression and by rendering CD4 T cells unresponsive to IFN\u03b3 signals, inducing the expression of Silencer of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)1 (Dienz and Rincon, 2009).",

This dissociation between high cortisol and low corticotropin hormone levels may occur in chronic inflammation or sepsis (Judd et al., 2000, Vermes and Beishuizen, 2001, Silverman et al., 2004, Silverman et al., 2005).",

Increased GH levels are not associated with a corresponding increase in IGF-1, which in turn decreases with a state of GH resistance (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). After an immune challenge, the increased level of GH could only partially be explained by a reduced feedback of IGF-1. One possible explanation of this uncoupling could be that the increase in GH acts as a counterbalance to reduce the negative metabolic changes occuring in persistent infection, but its effect is limited by the impaired activity of IGF-1. Conversely, considering that extrametabolic effects of GH have an important impact on immune function, it can be hypothesized that the rise in GH during infection may be an attempt to improve innate [Fig. 3(b)] and cell-mediated immune activity directly and/or, indirectly by counteracting increased levels of GCs (Bottasso et al., 2007).",

The high levels of GH at birth might be explained in relation to an early capacity of pigs to activate an inflammatory and innate response. Indeed, GH is able to increase IL-6, IL-2 and GM-CSF expression in the thymus (Savino et al., 2003) and in turn, IL-6 may regulate GH secretion (Tsigos et al., 1997). Since a paracrine influence exists between GH and IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, GH could be fundamental in increasing the levels of these cytokines for a prompt imprinting of innate response to pathogens. These aspects could play a key role as, unlike other species, neonatal piglets produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) early in life (Matteri and Carroll, 1997, Schwager and Schulze, 1997).",

The exact pathways leading to thymocyte death are not completely understood and may depend on the severity of infection (Savino, 2006). High serum levels of glucocorticoids, a typical event occuring in the host response to infections, have been considered a major pathway triggering thymocyte apoptosis (Herold et al., 2006). The apoptosis phenomenon triggered by TNF\u03b1 may be also involved in thymocyte death during infection and the depletion of thymic lymphocytes may result from a direct action of pathogens reaching the thymic parenchyma (Goncalves da Costa et al., 1991). In any case, a transient or long-term decrease in the serum levels of thymulin plays an important role (Savino, 2006).",

Recently, no effect on immune response during an experimental model of sepsis was shown (Schmitz et al., 2008) after GH treatment.

TNF-\u03b1 is one of the major mediators of the catabolic and anorexigenic effects during severe inflammation/infection (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). It has been suggested that these effects are mainly dependent on central signaling, particularly in the hypothalamus, where the cytokine is able to modulate the signals from leptin and insulin in a dose-dependent way, leading to defective control of feeding (Romanatto et al., 2007). Similarly to other inflammatory cytokines and leptin, IL-18 shares the characteristics of an endogenous anorectic adipocytokine which has a physiological role in energy homeostasis by suppressing food intake and feed efficiency (Zorrilla et al., 2007).",

Immunological challenge and the consequent increase of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and cortisol are involved in reduction of feed intake, skeletal muscle degradation and inhibition of growth (Webel et al., 1997, Wright et al., 2000). It is likely that clinical and subclinical infections impair the effectiveness of growth in livestock because the target tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle, become GH-resistant.

Moreover, in the adipocyte, adiponectin may be a regulator of inflammation via its suppression of the NF-\u03baB activation and upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b32 after LPS treatment (Ajuwon and Spurlock, 2005). A wide range of circulating adiponectin multimers has been identified (Fruebis et al., 2001, Kobayashi et al., 2004). Several studies have shown that different adiponectin isoforms are able to induce common responses (i.e. increase of apoptosis, activation of AMPK, reduction of scravenger receptor expression), but also induce isoform-specific responses (pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory) (Neumeier et al., 2006). Recently, two isomers of the adiponectin receptor have been found (Yamauchi et al., 2003) that appear to play different roles in glucose and lipid metabolism (Bjursell et al., 2007).",
