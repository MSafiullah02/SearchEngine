Research on each pathogen of concern requires a tailored, comprehensive assessment by experts across multiple disciplines, who consider the broad implications of conducting or curbing such research. Thus, current and future moratoria on such research should only be implemented with input and consensus from a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including the community of clinicians and other healthcare providers who are the end beneficiaries and users of such research but who have historically been underrepresented in the policy discussions on this topic.",
