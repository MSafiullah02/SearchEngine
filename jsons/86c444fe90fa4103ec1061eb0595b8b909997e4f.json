Acrimonious 19th century disputes between the contagionists and the sanitarians 1 had given way to an alliance which was steadily improving health. Rising living standards reduced infant deaths from gastroenteritis, through better food and water hygiene, and reduced deaths from \"consumption\" (tuberculosis), because of better nutrition. 2 The success of rat extermination in controlling plague in Sydney 3 provided a triumphant validation of new microbiological theories; Joseph Lister's carbolic spray was adopted by local surgeons; 4 Emil von Behring's antitoxin treatment reduced mortality from diphtheria; 5 and Paul Ehrlich's vision of a magic bullet to cure all infections was given credibility by the effi cacy of Salvarsan (arsphenamine, an arsenic-containing compound) against syphilis. 6 Maritime quarantine provided a signifi cant, if not impregnable, barrier to the introduction of epidemic diseases. 7 The MJA refl ected the progressive mentality of Australian doctors through reports on new international discoveries and leading articles.",

The fi ne sanatorium buildings in \"healthy\" locations such as the Blue Mountains are reminders of the desperate attempts to combine sanitary and microbiological principles by isolating patients to prevent spread of the disease while they were treated with rest and diet. 9,10 9,10 During World War II (WWII), intensive screening of Australian troops by miniature x-ray was followed up with bacteriological testing to identify patients with active infection, for whom treatment was compulsory. The success of this program prompted a postwar attempt to eradicate the disease from the civilian population, and the advent of streptomycin and sickness benefi t payments made compulsory treatment acceptable to the community. 11 11 Tuberculosis has again become resurgent in many countries. The high expense and long duration of triple therapy test the resources of the poorest countries. Undertreatment allows emergence of multidrug-resistant strains for which treatment reverts to pre-antibiotic options. In Australia, such strains are, mercifully, still uncommon.",

In the interwar decades, diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were produced in the newly established Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and school-based vaccination began. But in 1928, public confi dence was shaken by the Bundaberg tragedy, in which a multidose vial of diphtheria toxin-antitoxin became contaminated with staphylococci from the skin of a vaccinee. Twelve other children died. 14 14 This galvanised regulation of vaccine manufacture, safety testing and surveillance for adverse effects.

It was almost two decades before cell culture techniques paved the way for vaccines against polio, and then other childhood infections. The growing list of vaccines demanded new combinations to reduce the number of injections needed, and the cost became an issue even in wealthy countries where the plummeting prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases justifi ed the investment. 18 18 In the second half of the 20th century, even the basic triple antigen (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) was unaffordable in many developing countries, but international philanthropy plus political support have progressively been mobilised, resulting in signifi cant reduction of vaccine-preventable disease. Money is not the only problem. The projected global eradication of polio has stalled because confl icts in Africa and Pakistan have disrupted infrastructure and fanned ideological doubts about the political motivations of governments and charities. 19 19 In the optimistic political climate of the post-WWII years, the World Health Organization undertook an unprecedented program to achieve global eradication of smallpox. Frank Fenner was chairman of the project's management commission. Using Edward Jenner's 18th century vaccination technique and an international army of fi eld workers, smallpox eradication was achieved in 1980. 20 20 It remains the only example of intentional eradication of a human infectious disease.",

Conversely, recent resurgence of severe streptococcal infections underlines the mutability of \"old\" pathogens. 21 21 Antimicrobial drugs Sulfonamides made their spectacular entry into medicine just before WWII and cut the mortality from pneumonia and puerperal fever dramatically. Prontosil, a forerunner of all sulfonamide drugs, was not patentable, and manufacturers fl ooded the market with sulfonamide-like drugs. Penicillin soon followed -with Australian scientist Howard Florey being a key fi gure in its development -and was quickly adopted in military medicine. The antibiotic era had begun; as discovery followed discovery, it seemed that no bacterial infection would remain untreatable.

AIDS fi rst appeared in the gay communities of \"world cities\" in the early 1980s -the downside of sexual liberation. The inexorable rise in prevalence and apparently inevitable mortality of HIV infection spurred public health initiatives and scientifi c investigation. In Australia, safe-sex campaigns had an almost immediate effect in reducing numbers of new cases, as did controversial needle-exchange and harm-minimisation strategies for injecting drug users. 28 28 Global investment in research led to effective antiviral drugs and greatly extended the healthy lifespan of infected individuals in Western countries. However, in the populous countries of Africa, South America and Asia, heterosexual transmission dominated and led to epidemics of neonatal infection via transplacental transmission. 29 29 This social and economic catastrophe reawakened respect for infection, and also fuelled fear of nosocomial transmission of bloodborne viruses.",

In Australia, preventive human papillomavirus vaccination was pioneered by Ian Frazer and viral DNA detection has been added to screening by Pap smear, but neither of these approaches are affordable in poor countries, where death rates from cervical cancer are highest. 33 33 The challenges of demographic and environmental change",

Malaria -which depends on humans as a reservoir for the parasite and mosquitoes for transmission -was vulnerable to a combination of treating patients with drugs and spraying the environment with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) to kill mosquitoes. Large areas of the temperate zone and even the tropics became malaria free but, because mosquito eradication measures were inconsistently applied, drug-resistant parasites and DDT-resistant mosquitoes soon emerged. In the absence of an effective vaccine, prevention now relies on avoidance of mosquito bites by use of repellents, protective clothing and screens, plus an ever-diminishing number of effective prophylactic drugs. Malaria has been holding its own in many countries, aided by global warming. 34 34 Military deployment of troops in exotic areas and largescale movement of refugees are associated with outbreaks of communicable diseases. Cholera has been a recurrent problem when people seek shelter from war or natural disaster, most recently in Haiti. 35 35 Hantaan virus 36 36 caused over 3000 cases of Korean haemorrhagic fever and almost 300 deaths among American troops during the Korean war. The soldiers were exposed through inhalation of aerosolised rodent faeces when camped in wilderness areas. Other haemorrhagic fevers -such as Ebola virus disease and Lassa fever, for which native wildlife act as reservoirs -have caused human outbreaks with high mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Australia has several indigenous arboviruses, including Murray Valley encephalitis, and Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses. As global population pressure drives clearance of forested areas for agriculture, humans have become targets for many infections carried by wild animals. In Australia, outbreaks of Hendra virus infection and the emergence of the Australian lyssavirus have been linked to contact with fl ying foxes. 37 37 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which caused a deadly outbreak of respiratory disease centred in southern 38 38 but was transmitted to humans via infected palm civets, which were often for sale in Chinese markets. Control of SARS was achieved through international cooperation in identifying the new coronavirus and applying strict isolation procedures. 39 39 Even so, the high mortality brought home to the world the potential threat of contagious disease. Memories of the 1918 infl uenza pandemic lent renewed vigour to the WHO surveillance system for respiratory infections that emerge from reservoirs of infl uenza viruses in pigs, horses, poultry and wild birds (the latter two in particular). Alas, the ability to identify novel strains has not been matched by the ability to predict infectivity and severity of disease.",
