However, a public approach is needed to overcome common psychological barriers. Two of the most common problems are the breakdown of social support structures and the stigmatization of patients. As people are trying to avoid transmission of the virus, social support structures are breaking apart; places like churches, schools, and workplaces have been shut down, which eliminates the benefits of social support and may cause feelings of isolation and vulnerability. Furthermore, there is a high chance of the disease itself being stigmatized, as it is new and incurable.7 Most stigmatization targets are patients or specific groups of people (i.e., People with specific religion in south Korea or Asians in COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks, and West Africans in Ebola outbreaks). The targeted people are often removed from their social support system, which can lead to isolation and mental health problems. More importantly, stigmatization can drive potential patients to avoid accessing the healthcare system, and instead, continuing to spread infection over worries of being shunned by others. However, the current approach to mental health issues seems to focus mostly on individual factors rather than the public.",
