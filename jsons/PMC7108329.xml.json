Two broad approaches to diagnosis are used. The gold standard is the direct detection of the pathogen itself in clinical samples collected from the cases. A range of methods such as culture, electron microscopy, and pathogen genome detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used. Key performance issues are summarized in Table 1\n. Infection is often diagnosed indirectly by the detection of the patient's immune response to infection. The detection of pathogen specific IgM is a commonly used method for confirming acute infection. Today, clinical microbiology diagnostics increasingly rely on molecular techniques. This brief review will focus on the key features influencing the clinical use of molecular tests. The most widely used techniques are described. The advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are outlined in Table 2\n.",

In certain clinical situations, such as diagnosis of viral encephalitis or monitoring of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in organ transplant patients, PCR has transformed laboratory investigations because of its exquisite sensitivity and specificity, and is clearly the method of choice. PCR allows the amplification of millions of identical DNA copies from an originally small amount of pathogen genome in a clinical sample. In principal, the target DNA is first extracted then denatured at high temperature. Specific oligonucleotide primers are annealed to the DNA in a lower temperature, followed by an extension phase during which the DNA polymerase enzyme copies the template strand. This cycle is repeated, usually 30\u201340 times, resulting in millions of identical DNA copies. For the principles of PCR see Figure 1\n.",

Direct sequencing is usually considered as the gold standard as it provides accurate and extensive data. Genotyping plays an important role in the management of HCV infection, as response to treatment considerably varies between different genotypes; patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection respond better to treatment than those with genotype 1 infection. Both direct sequencing and probe hybridization approaches are widely used for HCV genotyping.16 An example of genotyping currently moving into routine practice is human papilloma virus (HPV) typing. Eight oncogenic HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58) are responsible for 80% of cervical cancers and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia worldwide; distinct patterns are seen in different regions.

False-positive and/or false-negative results in molecular diagnostic techniques can occur either due to suboptimal assay performance, sample contamination, wrong specimen material, or wrong timing of the sample collection. In addition, a positive result may be without clinical significance, sometimes due to the low detection threshold of these techniques.",

For PCR the main issue is avoiding contamination from the products of PCR which have a high concentration after amplification. This was a major issue when PCR was first introduced, and has led to laboratory work areas for different steps of PCR being physically separated to avoid contamination. In optimal conditions, the same personnel will never work with both amplified products and clean reagents. Aseptic and meticulous working techniques are required to avoid specimen-to-specimen contamination. The introduction of real-time PCR has reduced the potential for contamination by reducing handling. Regular quality control of the assays is vital, including negative and internal positive controls, as well as continual trend analyses, which must be reflected in the epidemiology of the pathogen in question.",

Detecting a potential pathogen (e.g. rotavirus) in a faecal sample from a case of meningitis may not be significant. Quantity of pathogen present is also important; for example, detection of CMV nucleic acid in blood is a sign of ongoing infection, but may be without clinical significance as healthy individuals may also undergo reactivations; therefore, quantitative CMV PCR is the method of choice for use in immunocompromised patients to guide treatment.",

Quality and timing of sample collection are of high importance. A fine example of this is PCR testing of C. trachomatis in urine. Too early post-treatment testing may result in clinically false-positive results due to detectable traces of nucleic acid by PCR without presence of infectious pathogen, since shedding can be detected for much longer by PCR than culture. Wrong timing may also lead to false-negative results, such as PCR testing of respiratory and stool samples collected late in the disease process, when the viral nucleic acid has already cleared. In this case, serological investigation may help in the diagnosis.Practice points\n\u2022Appropriate site, quality, and timing of specimen collection are vital for reliable molecular diagnostic analyses\u2022To fully exploit the potential of new molecular tests, clinicians need to recognize their enhanced opportunities for diagnosis, but also their constraints.\u2022Laboratory results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient\n\n",
