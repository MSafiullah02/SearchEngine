A standard questionnaire, including demographic data, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, complications, and duration of hospitalization, was filled out for each patient. A serum sample and a nasopharyngeal wash were obtained from each patient within 48 h of admission. The samples were kept frozen at -70\u00b0C until further study.

When a PCR of nested or seminested type was used, it was conducted in a separate room to avoid intrasample contamination. cDNAs obtained from viral lysates served as positive controls, whereas several negative controls (virus transport medium or water) were included in each run to exclude the possibility of contamination.",

Information regarding the patients' characteristics was also examined to adjust for potential confounding through regression models. Such characteristics included demographic characteristics, duration of fever and antibiotic use before admission, presence and duration of cough and rhinitis, and history of asthma and bronchodilator use. Linear and logistic regression models were used for symptoms that were examined through continuous and binary variables, respectively. First, univariate regressions were performed with RV alone, mycoplasma alone, S. pneumoniae alone, any virus, any single pathogen, and mixed infection for each symptom. Then, a multivariate analysis was performed with all the variables that exhibited statistically significant effect on that symptom. The level of significance was fixed at \u03b1 = 5%.

RV was also found to be only second to RSV in prevalence in infants with bronchiolitis, and its presence was associated with more severe disease [7]. The advent of sensitive PCR-based detection techniques may partly explain the increasing recognition of the involvement of RV in respiratory diseases [24]. Before the PCR era, RV was examined in a small number of studies of childhood CAP and was identified in 2%\u201312% of cases [18, 20]. More recently, RV was found in 25% of children with CAP with the use of 2 PCR assays [8]. Although the prevalence of RV in the asymptomatic population was not formally assessed in this study, it has been shown to be in the range of 6%\u201318% in previous studies that used PCR [33, 34] (N. G. Papadopoulos, unpublished data). Furthermore, we performed PCR for RV in 27 samples from children of the same age group, without an obvious respiratory infection, collected in our hospital during the same period of time and retrieved from our sample bank. Only 1 (3.7%) of those was found to yield a positive result, which is statistically significantly less than the proportion identified in children with CAP (P = .0001, by \u03c72 test).",

Presently, it is unlikely that results of viral diagnosis would influence treatment decisions if they were available to clinicians. Withholding antibiotics would only be feasible if bacterial (mainly pneumococcal) infection could be ruled out with certainty. Identification of a viral infection does not rule out the coexistence of a bacterium, because mixed infections are common. Determination of IgM antibodies to M. pneumoniae with \u00b5-capture ELISA may be useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment, because these antibodies are detected in a high proportion of patients during the acute phase of illness.",
