However, mobile shopping adoption across the globe is not wide or fast as expected. In addition, the research is very scant in understanding various predictors of consumer adoption towards mobile shopping. The objective of this study is to identify most significant and non-significant predictors of consumer mobile shopping acceptance. Systematic review and weight analysis on 34 mobile shopping studies revealed researchers mostly employed TAM and UTAUT model as theoretical lens. This study found an interesting revelation that extrinsic motivation variables such as social influence and perceived usefulness determine consumer mobile shopping behavioral intention during early stages. However, in later stages intrinsic motivation variables such as satisfaction and trust play crucial role to emerge as best and promising predictor of consumer continuous intention respectively.",

The characteristics of smartphones with wireless Internet enable consumers to purchase goods and services from anywhere at any time, even in the absence wired broadband connections popularly known as mobile shopping [2] . It empowers consumer with ability to search, browse, compare, and purchase products and services through wireless handheld mobile devices. And, they can buy range of products and services such as electronics, apparels, housewares, books, tickets, beauty, and grocery to name a few [3] [4] [5] . The unprecedented smartphones adoption rate is in turn fuelling the mobile shopping growth to reshape the online retail environment. Leading market research firm Statista report suggests that mobile e-commerce is poised for growth globally and could possibly rake in upwards of 3.5 trillion USD constituting almost three quarters (72.9%) of all e-commerce sales [6] . Mobile phones unique characteristics enable organisations to reach right consumers anytime anywhere through mobile advertising [7, 8] . Organisation's spend on mobile advertising is on upward trajectory with a whopping amount of 105.95 billion USD in 2017 and an estimated amount of 175.64 billion USD in 2020 [9] .",

Despite the potential of mobile technology, mobile readiness report on Fortune 500 companies' mobile websites revealed just one-quarter had mobile-responsiveness and majority of the companies were unprepared [10] . The majority of existing consumer on mobile shopping acceptance studies focused on intention related outcome variables such as behavioural intention [11] [12] [13] , purchase intention [14, 15] , and continuous intention [16, 17] rather than use behaviour. Mobile shopping adoption can be achieved at faster rate based on the learning from existing research on this topic across different countries. Existing review articles on mobile shopping mostly provide descriptive information e.g., [18, 19] without highlighting on the effective predictors necessary for successful adoption. Therefore, the objective of this study is to employ weight-analysis to synthesise existing findings on mobile shopping and identify the most/least frequently used predictors, and among these the best, worst, and promising predictors [20, 21] . This study will undertake following steps to fulfil the objective:",

It employed keyword based search in the Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO Business Source complete databases with search terms such as \"mobile shopping\" OR \"m-shopping\" OR \"mobile purchasing\" AND \"Adoption\" OR \"Acceptance\" OR \"Diffusion\" OR \"Usage\" OR \"Intention\" to locate articles related to mobile shopping. The initial search from the year 2009 to 2019 resulted in 72 articles. On further screening, it was found that some of the articles were not accessible through researcher's library and numerous studies employed outcome variables other than consumer intention and usage towards mobile shopping. Such instances include but are not limited to outcome variables such as switching intention [32] , loyalty [33] , and patronage [34] . Therefore, studies that did not report relevant data for weight analysis were also excluded resulting in 34 final manuscripts that focussed only on consumer intention and usage as outcome variable to qualify for weight analysis.",

Table 1 provides summary of dominant theories that are employed on two or more instances. Technology acceptance model (TAM) emerged as the most dominant theory with as much as 12 studies adapting TAM as theoretical lens by often extending the model with external constructs. For instance, Gro\u00df [35] extended TAM with perceived enjoyment and trust and found these attributes as significant predictor of consumers mobile shopping in Germany. Venkatesh, Morris, Davis and Davis [36] 's, UTAUT theory emerged as the distant second most popular theory with five research investigations. Three studies adapted Expectancy Confirmation Model making it the third most popular theoretical lens in the consumer mobile shopping acceptance arena. Multifaceted trust-risk model and theory of planned behaviour jointly occupied fourth position by serving as theoretical lens on two instances each. Furthermore, there were eight theories/models such as (1) 4P's marketing theory [16] , (2) Behavioural reasoning theory [37] , (3) Elaboration likelihood model [38] , (4) Flow theory [39] , (5) IS success model [14] , (6) Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) framework [40] , (7) Technology readiness [41] , and (8) Trust transfer theory [15] that researchers employed on one instance each. Finally, there were two studies [42, 43] that did not employ any dominant theories to examine consumer mobile shopping acceptance.",

The intersection points between studies in a \"row\" and path relationship in the \"column\" captured the significance of the particular path relationship corresponding to that study. The coding scheme has four different values: (1) '+1' in the case where the path relationship examined was significant and hypothesized in positive direction; (2) '\u22121' in the case where the path relationship examined was significant and hypothesized in negative direction; (3) '0' in the case where the path relationship examined was non-significant; and (4) \"Blank\" when the relationship was not studied [21] .

These theories were originally developed in the organisational context with major focus on individual employee characteristics and their motivation in using underlying technologies to improve job related outcomes. In addition, perceived usefulness similar to performance expectancy (11 studies) and perceived ease of use (9 studies) similar to effort expectancy the two independent variables of technology acceptance model (TAM) emerged as the most utilized variables emphasising TAM's dominance in individual adoption research. Besides individual characteristics from dominant technology acceptance theories, researchers have scarcely employed theories such as IS success model e.g., [16, 72] and flow theory e.g., [39, 52] to evaluate impact of system characteristics such as system quality, information quality, and system flow experience on consumer mobile shopping acceptance.

The best predictors of consumer behavioural intention, which refers to early and potential users of technology are perceived usefulness, attitude, and social influence. This is followed by compatibility and perceived behavioural control that emerged as most promising predictors with all significant results for early mobile shopping users.

In addition, attributes such as trust, perceived risk, and trust in mobile vendor emerged as the promising predictor with all significant results. This underscores the significant role of both the platform and vendors in sustaining the existing consumers and influencing their continuous intention for future transactions. The emergence of variables such as Trust in mobile vendor as promising predictor only for continuous intention and not for behavioural intention further validates the role of product/service providers in improving the longevity of consumers towards mobile shopping. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness/performance expectancy that was best predictor of behavioural intention became least effective predictor of consumer continuous intention towards mobile shopping. The plausible explanation for this pattern comes from Hung, Yang and Hsieh [55] study that extended Expectation-Confirmation model with Trust to examine consumer continuous intention towards mobile shopping. The study results among 244 consumers found that extrinsic motivation variable perceived usefulness became non-significant determinant of continuous intention over time. However, during repurchasing activities, intrinsic motivation variable 'trust' explained the most variance on consumer continuous intention towards mobile shopping followed by Satisfaction. Finally, both Satisfaction and Behavioural intention the two predictors of Use behaviour emerged as promising predictor with all significant results. The preceding discussion indicates Use behaviour is sparingly examined as outcome variable in consumer mobile shopping acceptance. This pattern is understandable as consumer mobile shopping is still at nascent stages of acceptance in many parts of the world and researchers are trying to measure the intention rather than actual behaviour [20] . However, Wu and Du [73] meta-analysis on BI and UB caution the notion of IS researchers considering BI as surrogate of UB. Because, individual's use behaviour towards technology cannot be measured without assessing their actual system usage. Furthermore, Wu and Du [73] cautioned research community that they should be circumspect of studies that measure only behavioural intention without investigating use behaviour. Figure 1 depicts the resultant model emerging from weight analysis on mobile shopping empirical studies.",

The findings emerging from this study is important for future researchers in this domain and practitioners alike. Weight analysis results found among fourteen unique independent variables (Table 3) only four emerged as the best predictor three on behavioural intention (perceived usefulness, attitude, and social influence) and one on continuous intention (Satisfaction). This is followed by five promising predictor two on behavioural intention (compatibility, perceived behavioural control) and three on continuous intention (trust, trust in mobile vendor, and perceived risk), which are more likely candidates to emerge as best predictor in future. Therefore, researchers should continue using promising predictors while investigating consumer mobile shopping acceptance alongside the best predictors. The remaining five final independent variables perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, personal innovativeness, anxiety, and facilitating conditions emerged only as least effective predictors on consumer mobile shopping acceptance endogenous variables. Perceived ease of use one of the core construct of TAM, despite being the second most frequently used predictor produced the most non-significant results. Therefore, researchers should be more cautious while operationalizing this type of construct in their research model. They should make necessary adaptations and/or omit irrelevant constructs such as least effective predictors from the model depending upon context rather than having obligation to replicate all the constructs in underpinning model/theory. Moreover, the review found almost half -47% studies in consumer mobile shopping arena employed theories developed under organisational context such as TAM and UTAUT.

In future, researchers should widen their search horizon to more databases that will increase the number of studies available for analysis and minimize publication bias. Second, weight analysis does not take sample size into consideration like meta-analysis and cannot provide true effect size in a path relationship. In future, researchers should try to combine meta-analysis with weight analysis to calculate the true-effect size of path relationships.

In future, researchers should include all outcome variables to provide comprehensive overview on various outcomes measured in consumer mobile shopping acceptance arena and their predictors.
