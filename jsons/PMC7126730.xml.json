            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is caused by PED virus, an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae that is related to transmissible gas-troenteritis coronavirus (Pensaert and DeBouck, 1978, Hofmann and Wyler, 1989). The PED virus emerged as a global threat to the swine industry in 2013, when a number of epidemics were reported in many important swine-producing countries in North America and East Asia that were previously believed to be PED virus-free (Mole, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2014, Park et al., 2014, Hanke et al., 2015, Song et al., 2015). The PED virus was first reported in Japan in the 1990s, and a live PED vaccine was approved in 1996 (Sueyoshi et al., 1995). There have been only a few isolated outbreaks that had minimal effects on the pork production enterprises of Japan subsequently. In October 2013, however, a PED outbreak was reported in Japan (Okinawa Prefecture) after an interval of 7 years when there were no infestations reported (Sasaki et al., 2016). The epidemic of PED virus infection spread rapidly throughout Japan (Diep et al., 2017) and was also reported in Kagoshima prefecture, which has the largest number of pig farms in Japan. In Kagoshima, a numbers of farms produce pork from Kagoshima Berkshire pigs (\u2018Kagoshima Kurobuta\u2019) which is one of the most sought pork brands in Japan. Approximately 25% of farms in Kagoshima Prefecture have Kagoshima Berkshire pigs (MAFF, 2012). Berkshire pork is an excellent quality meat, and the retail price for purebred Berkshire is 50% greater than that for a typical pig that has been developed to marketable size (LWD; Suzuki et al., 2003). Kagoshima Berkshire pigs reportedly have a lesser productivity, including litter size and fertility, compared with F1 crossbred pigs (Matsumoto and Koketsu, 2003, Sasaki et al., 2014), and pre-weaning mortality of Berkshire sows before the PED outbreak was reported to be 5.0% (Sasaki et al., 2014). Productivity of Kagoshima Berkshire sows exposed to PED virus has not been, however, reported in Japan. In F1 sows, the relationship between PED virus infection and productivity of sows reportedly differs when the sows are exposed to the virus at different stages of pregnancy (Olanratmanee et al., 2010). Compared with uninfected sows, infection with PED virus during the first 30 days of pregnancy significantly reduced litter size, but no reduction of litter size was observed as a result of infection with PED virus during the other stages of pregnancy (Olanratmanee et al., 2010).",

All the breeding gilts and sows on this farm were purebred Kagoshima Berkshire pigs that had been bred on the farm or purchased from the Livestock Research Institute of the Kagoshima Prefectural Institute for Agricultural Development. Pregnancy was confirmed with ultrasonography (Agroscan, Frontier International Co., Ltd.) 21 days after the first mating. The farm management included a 3-week batch production system, in which the sows were divided into seven reproductive groups, 3 weeks apart in stage of their reproduction (Fig. 1\n). Biosecurity measures practiced at the farm where the research was conducted were shower-in/shower-out for staff and visitors, changing clothes and footwear before entering the operation, rodent control, washing and disinfection of the chute floor after each loading/unloading, and washing and disinfection of the truck before loading. Both gilts and sows were housed in stalls on a partially slatted floor from the first mating and throughout gestation. In the lactation barns, crates with completely perforated floors made of cast iron or woven wire were used. The lactation and gestation diets were formulated from imported corn and soybean meal. The calculated composition of the gestation diet was 13.5% CP, 0.7% Ca, 0.5% P and 2.0% fat, whereas the nutrient constituency of the lactating diet was 15.0% CP, 0.7% Ca, 0.5% P and 5.0% fat.",

On the farm where the present study was conducted, the PED outbreak began in the gestation barn on January 6 and spread to the farrowing barn on January 9, 2014. The diagnosis of PED was confirmed with reverse transcription (RT) PCR and the immuno-histochemical analysis of fecal samples. The initial clinical signs on the farm where the research was conducted were diarrhea in the gilts and sows and the death of newborn piglets. The death of new born piglets attributed to PED ceased at the end of January. The animals on the farm were immunized with natural treatment methods with the PED virus. The feces of infected pigs were obtained, ground, mixed well and fed to the pregnant gilts and sows, sows from which pigs had been weaned, and gilts used for replacing culled sows within 2 weeks of the onset of clinical symptoms of PED. Intensive cleaning, disinfection, and early weaning programs were also instituted. All the gilts and sows were vaccinated with a live PED vaccine (Nisseiken Co., Ltd., Oume, Tokyo, Japan) from the end of March 2014.",

Sow was included as a random effect in the statistical models. Lactation length was included in the analysis of weaning and subsequent litter performance. The weaning-to-first-mating interval was also included in the analysis of mating and subsequent litter performance. The data are shown as means \u00b1 SEM.

The fewer number of piglets weaned and the increase in pre-weaning mortality could be attributable to the lack of antibodies against PED virus in the colostrum of the sows in the G4 and L groups. A reduction of number in the piglets weaned and an increase in pre-weaning mortality reduces the efficiency of pork production, causing economic losses. In particular, a reduction in piglet numbers of Berkshire breeding resulted in a greater economic loss compared with what occurred in pork production enterprises producing pork from other breeding, because the Berkshire pork is of greater value when marketed because of its excellent quality meat. The retail price of purebred Berkshire pigs is 50% greater than that of typical market weight pigs (LWD; Suzuki et al., 2003).",

These results suggest that the sows in the G1, G2, and G3 groups acquired immunity against the PED virus through herd immunization. On the farm where the data for the present study was collected, the immunization technique used involved feeding the sows the feces and minced intestines of infected piglets. The piglets delivered from seropositive sows might acquire passive immunity from their mothers (Olanratmanee et al., 2010), reducing their mortality as a result of immune resistance to the PED virus (Song et al., 2007). In addition, previous studies reported that passive lactogenic immunity to PED virus is important for suckling piglet protection due to an immature immune system of the neonatal suckling piglet (Langel et al., 2016), and antibody provided in colostrum and milk protects the piglet in the interval between birth and development of a functional immune system (Poonsuk et al., 2016). Further research into the immunization technique and productivity, however, is required to determine if these findings are relevant to all production settings. Cleaning and sterilization of facilities would also reduce the residual PED virus in the farrowing barn. On the farm where the data for the present study were collected, batch farrowing was used, in which the sows were classified into seven groups (a 3-week system), so there was enough time to ensure a sufficient disinfection regimen.",

These findings are consistent with a previous study that reported a lesser farrowing rate during the 4-month period after a PED outbreak compared with the same period the previous year (Olanratmanee et al., 2010). The lesser farrowing rates in the G4 and L groups of the present study might be associated with a lesser suckling stimulus and feed intake caused by the fewer piglets weaned. A lesser sucking stimulus could affect the hormonal milieu (Poleze et al., 2006) affecting ovulation rate, which will reduce the farrowing rate. An inadequate nutrient intake during lactation also influences the metabolic state of sows before the final growth of the pre-ovulatory follicles which is an important determinant of subsequent fertility (Poleze et al., 2006). The lesser farrowing rate of sows in the W group could have been associated with an inadequate body condition arising from anorexia and watery diarrhea at the time of mating, which can cause early pregnancy loss (Dial et al., 1992). The effect of the PED outbreak on post-weaning performance was not severe compared with its effect on weaning performance.",

These results indicate that the PED outbreak had no negative effect on litter performance at subsequent parity both at the herd and individual sow level. These findings may be attributable to the prolonged weaning-to-conception interval arising from the reduced farrowing rate in these sows. A prolonged weaning-to-conception interval reportedly increases piglet litter size (Koketsu and Dial, 1998), and this could provide enough time for severely PED-infected sows to recover their body condition.",
