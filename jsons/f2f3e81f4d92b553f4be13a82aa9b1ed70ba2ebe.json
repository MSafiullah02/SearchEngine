            "text": "(about 20%). 1 To improve survival of patients with PDAC, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. One of the main focuses of current research in this field aims at identifying new molecular targets and subgroups of PDAC that may benefit from personalised treatment, opening new landscapes for the so-called 'precision oncology'. 2 In this context, tumours with microsatellite instability (MSI)/ defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) represent a molecular subgroup of malignancies with novel therapeutic opportunities given the significant results of immunotherapy recently reported in this setting. 3 4 The mismatch repair system is a mechanism that recognises and repairs the erroneous insertion, deletion and misincorporation of bases that can arise during DNA replication and recombination and in some conditions of DNA damage. 3 4 Alterations affecting such a mechanism are defined as dMMR. Microsatellites are short and very repetitive sequences of 1-6 DNA base pairs that are found throughout the genome. Due to the repetitive nature, their alteration is typically present in cases of dMMR and is defined as MSI. 3 4 Tumours with MSI/dMMR usually accumulate thousands of mutations and are characterised by a hypermutated genome. Interestingly, this condition can be tested using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular tests, including classic (PCR)-based microsatellite testing and novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches. 4 MSI/dMMR occurs in a respectable proportion of colorectal cancers (about 15%), is associated with distinct biological behaviour and differential response to different therapies, and thus routine screening is advocated in guidelines. 4 For PDAC, however, its frequency varies largely among different studies and a complete definition of MSI/dMMR PDACs is still lacking. Therefore, with this systematic review, coupled with a comparative analysis with existing databases, we aim at clarifying the true frequency of MSI/dMMR in PDAC, also highlighting the specific histological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of this tumour subtype.",

For each article, information about authors, year of publication, country of origin of the analysed cohort, number of patients, number of MSI/dMMR tumours, histological and molecular data on MSI/dMMR tumours, methods for MSI/dMMR testing, presence of Lynch syndrome and survival outcomes was extracted. Finally, all extracted data were reported and summarised in table 1, and then analysed, interpreted and discussed by all authors. To assess for differences in histological features between PDAC in unselected patients versus those with dMMR/MSI, a Fisher's exact test was used to compare our results with a large published cohort, specifically reporting the histological subtypes of patients with familial and sporadic pancreatic cancers. 7 This method has also been recently used by Hruban et al to compare the histology of an original cohort of ATM-mutated PDAC with that of conventional PDAC. 8 To further corroborate our results, a comparison was also carried out considering patients from the SEER database as another validation cohort. 9 In order to assess for differences in additional molecular features between PDAC in unselected patients versus those with dMMR/MSI, a Fisher's exact test was used to compare our results with data published by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA), which we used as a reference cohort. 10 Furthermore, availing the manuscripts selected for this systematic review to assess differences in terms of survival, a meta-analysis comparing the prognostic outcomes of MSI/dMMR PDAC versus non-MSI/dMMR PDAC was performed using the programmes 'Comprehensive Meta-Analysis' and 'RevMan 5' (http://www. meta-analysis. com, last access 9 March 2020). Lastly, in order to define the presence of any potentially specific driver gene in MSI/dMMR PDAC, we analysed the existing literature on genetic drivers in MSI/dMMR tumours and reviewed, using linear comparisons, all available sequencing data from our systematic review.",

Singhi et al also reported results from NGS of a large PDAC cohort (3594 cases): interestingly, one case among the three detected MSI/dMMR PDACs harboured the druggable FGFR2-POC1B fusion. 44 Regarding the presence of any potential specific driver genes in MSI/dMMR PDAC, we found a bi-univocal correspondence regarding genes belonging to the JAK/STAT pathway and those of KMT2 family. Indeed, these have been described as frequently mutated in MSI/dMMR cancers of different extrapancreatic sites 45 46 ; the review of all molecular data of MSI/ dMMR PDAC showed the involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway also in MSI/dMMR PDAC, given that the paper by Wartenberg et al, 39 Regarding the association of MSI/dMMR pancreatic cancers with Lynch syndrome, a total of 27 cases were reported in the background of this genetic condition.

We performed a metaanalysis for calculating the relative risks for overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and also for 'all-types' of survival (ATS, putting together OS and disease-free survival), to find any potential association between MSI/dMMR and prognosis in PDAC. No data for calculating the HRs were present. The results on risk ratios showed that there is not a significant impact on the survival for MSI/dMMR in PDAC (OS: p=0.36; DSS: p=0.50; ATS: p=0.16 ; online supplementary figures 1-3). At the same time, it is also of importance to highlight the high heterogeneity of the results (I 2 =86%, 88% and 63% for OS, DSS and ATS, respectively) and that there are too few data (only five manuscripts) to draw any definitive conclusion.",

            "text": "Regarding the prevalence of MSI/dMMR in PDAC, it is around 2.5% considering all published data, but this value goes down significantly to 1.1% when considering only studies that use more recently developed, standardised and validated NGS techniques. Thus, the percentage of 2.5% appears as an overestimation of the real MSI/dMMR prevalence in PDAC. This may be due, at least in part, to the different and not validated methods used in the past for MSI/dMMR assessment. Indeed, 15 different PCR tests and 4 different IHC panels have been used considering all the studies selected for this systematic review. However, only six studies based on IHC/PCR used the suggested and standardised IHC antibodies and/or NCI/MSI PCR markers. 9 47 48 It is also important to acknowledge that the NCI guidelines regarding MSI testing were first published in 1998, 47 thus papers published up to this time could not have adopted an NCI panel. The most important MSI marker in the initial NCI guidelines was BAT26, which is a highly sensitive and specific marker of MSI. Some early manuscripts reported high levels of MSI-likely but these were potentially due to inappropriate microsatellite markers. Contrary to this situation, all studies based on NGS appeared more reliable: they used NGS coupled with validation tools, analysed larger cohorts and gave more homogeneous results, with a range of MSI/dMMR prevalence from 0% to 1.6% (mean value of 1.1%). Based on these considerations, the real prevalence of MSI/dMMR in PDAC could be reasonably considered to be around 1%-2%, or even less (<1%). Furthermore, along these lines, it is evident that the use of reliable and standardised procedures is mandatory. An important point concerns tumour site within the pancreas. There were no statistically significant differences between conventional PDAC and MSI/dMMR PDAC, with pancreatic head confirmed as the elective location also for this PDAC subgroup. However, this tumour location may also be responsible for the overestimation of the true prevalence of MSI/dMMR in PDAC. Indeed, large ampullary/periampullary-duodenal cancers with pancreatic infiltration may be misdiagnosed as PDAC (in these cases it could be very difficult to establish the real site of origin) and MSI/dMMR is a molecular alteration more typical of neoplasms with intestinal differentiation. 9 49 Regarding the histology of MSI/dMMR PDAC, medullary and mucinous/colloid variants of PDAC resulted significantly more common in this PDAC subgroup (two representative cases, including the immunohistochemical pattern, are illustrated in figures 1 and 2). However, these histological subtypes are not always associated with MSI/dMMR. Indeed, medullary histology can be found in microsatellite stable PDAC, for example, in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. 20 Similarly, mucinous/colloid features can be found in microsatellite stable PDAC, for example, in association with GNAS (also in association with pre-existing IPMN) or germline-ATM mutations. 8 38 50 It should be reiterated here that medullary and colloid carcinoma are significantly more common in the ampulla than in the pancreas, and considering the well-known proneness of ampullary cancers to be mistaken as pancreatic origin, 51 in a case with this diagnosis, the possibility of a secondary invasion from the ampulla, or even a metastasis from the colon ought to be carefully excluded. 52 However, due to the strong association of these two PDAC variants with MSI/dMMR, for cases of medullary and mucinous/colloid histology, the final pathology report should be integrated with the assessment of MSI/dMMR status. This should be performed using IHC as first-line analysis, also following existing guidelines, 4 and, only in the case of doubtful or not reliable IHC results, MSI-based PCR should be executed. Considering the different advantages and limitations of the methods of MSI testing in PDAC (which have been summarised in table 2), NGS is recommended as first-line analysis in the case of limited tissue, and in the context of precision oncology.",

This is a very unusual profile for PDAC, which calls for further genetic analysis for the selection of therapeutic strategies. Indeed, KRAS wild-type PDAC, although unusual, include a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that may have potential targets for precision medicine. These comprise MSI/dMMR, and other important genetic alterations, such as those involving BRAF gene, and kinase fusion genes (eg, FGFR2 and NTRK fusions). 44 53 Notably, one case with FGFR2 fusion has been described in the context of MSI/dMMR. 44 Moreover, TMB resulted high in the majority of MSI/dMMR PDAC, and this represents another variable strictly associated with benefits from immunotherapy. Further studies in PDAC should also address whether better response to immunotherapy could be reached where there is co-existence of MSI/ dMMR and high TMB, such as in colorectal cancer. 54 We also found additional potential driver genes typically involved in MSI/ dMMR PDAC: JAK (JAK1 and JAK3) and KMT2 (KMT2C and KMT2D). JAK genes code for a homonymous family of kinases, which are required for the signalling of a host of immune modulators in tumour, stromal and immune cells; alterations in this family have been associated with an immune evasion by tumour Can detect simultaneously specific somatic and germline mutations of different genes",

Regarding survival of MSI/dMMR patients with PDAC, this systematic review revealed that there are no significant improvements in survival outcomes for this subgroup of patients. However, regarding this point, the results of our meta-analysis cannot be considered definitive, because available data on this aspect are still limited and also because of their high heterogeneity; further studies are needed to address this important point. Indeed, although MSI/dMMR is a well-recognised prognostic moderator of some cancers, with a strong association to better prognosis such as in colorectal, gastric, duodenal and ampullary cancers, 4 in PDAC such survival improvement is not so clear. The morphological and genetic complexity of this tumour type and its high aggressiveness may explain only in part these findings, indicating the probable presence of other still unknown but important factors along this line.

Due to its very low prevalence and also on the basis of this systematic review, MSI/dMMR should be determined as firstline analysis and with specific tests (IHC, then MSI-based PCR only in case of doubtful results; NGS in case of limited tissue) during PDAC routine diagnostic activity only in case of typical histology (medullary or mucinous/colloid). Conversely, to search for new potential targets for precision oncology (eg, the FGFR-POC1B fusion described in a MSI/dMMR PDAC or other targets in non-MSI/dMMR PDAC), MSI should be assessed as secondline action ideally using NGS, to permit additional simultaneous analysis and potentially provide more options for treatment.",
