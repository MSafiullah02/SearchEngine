            "text": "Hantaviruses belong to the family of the Bunyaviridae, and are a group of closely related negative-stranded RNA viruses, with a trisegmented genome (Schmaljohn et al., 1985). They are lipid-enveloped, spherical viruses of 80\u2013110 nm in diameter. In contrast to other Bunyaviridae genera that are transmitted by arthropods, hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses that are transmitted to humans, probably through inhalation of infected rodent excreta (Maes et al., 2004). Hantaviruses produce persistent non-pathogenic infections in rodents, but give rise to several severe clinical diseases in humans (Avsic-Zupanc et al., 1999, Clement et al., 1997, Peters and Khan, 2002). On the Eurasian continent, two murine subfamilies, Arvicolinae and Murinae, are the natural rodent hosts of hantaviruses, which are the causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal function (HFRS). Hantaviruses of the American continent, are responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and are carried by the murine subfamily Sigmodontinae (Chu et al., 1994, Hjelle et al., 1995, Monroe et al., 1999). Each hantavirus is associated with a specific host species, but occasional spillover infections in related rodents have been reported (Vincent et al., 2000, Wang et al., 2000). In Europe, two hantaviruses, Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava-Belgrade viruses, are known to cause HFRS (Clement et al., 1997, Plyusnin et al., 2001). PUUV, which is carried by bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and found almost throughout Europe, generally causes a mild form of HFRS, called nephropathia epidemica, characterized mainly by fever and renal dysfunction, sometimes with hemorrhagic manifestations (Kanerva et al., 1998, Mustonen et al., 1994). The case fatality rate of nephropathia epidemica varies from 0.1 to 0.3%, and with approximately 5000 cases annually, PUUV is responsible for a significant morbidity in Europe (Brummer-Korvenkontio et al., 1999, Valtonen et al., 1995).",

The dynamic range of the assay was determined by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of the cRNA standard ranging from 10 to 1012 molecules. The results were analyzed in terms of C\nt value (the cycle in which a target sequence was detected). The dynamic range of the assay spans 6 logs ranging from 2 to 8 log molecules PUUV per reaction, corresponding to C\nt values ranging from 38.74 \u00b1 0.27 to 14.32 \u00b1 0.01.",

For all dilutions, the differences in virus titers recovered were within 0.5 log of the virus stock controls. Mock samples containing no virus but treated with disinfectant were also tested for their effect on Vero E6 cell monolayers. These mock samples had no adverse effect on the Vero E6 cell monolayers. The ultracentrifugation washing step was thus considered to have removed the disinfectants prior to virus titration and no additional steps to neutralize the disinfectants during the procedure were taken.",

            "text": "Hantaviruses represent a hazard for hospital and laboratory workers and thus it is important to determine the virucidal power of various disinfectant agents under strict experimental conditions. With the Klein\u2013Deforest scheme, human viruses can be divided into groups A, B, and C with respect to inactivation of lipophilic (enveloped, lipid membrane) and hydrophilic (naked) viruses (Klein and Deforest, 1983). The Bunyaviridae are a family of negative-stranded, lipid-enveloped, spherical RNA viruses, and thus are classified into the lipid-enveloped virus containing group A. Group A viruses are susceptible to a wide variety of detergents and alcohols attaining the lipid-envelope. But there is little data available specific about hantavirus inactivation. Chloroform, \u03b2-propiolactone, sodium hypochloride, ethanol and phenol have been described as good disinfectant agents for hantaviruses (Schmaljohn et al., 1999). However, chloroform, \u03b2-propiolactone and phenol can induce cancer in humans, and are therefore not recommended as disinfectant agents in laboratories. Recently, effective inactivation of Hantaan virus with methanol and paraformaldehyde has been demonstrated (Kraus et al., 2005). This study confirmed complete inactivation of PUUV with methanol after 10 min (see Table 1), but in contrast to expectations, inactivation of PUUV with absolute ethanol was completed only after 30 min. After a 10 min inactivation with ethanol, the concentration of PUUV was 1.7 \u00d7 105\n geq/mL (Table 1). The inactivation of PUUV with a 70% solution of ethanol, also took 30 min to be completed. After an inactivation of 10 min, the concentration of PUUV was 3.6 \u00d7 105\n geq/mL (Table 1). These findings were confirmed with focus assay. After inactivation with absolute ethanol or with a 70% solution of ethanol during 30 min, virus could not be detected by using focus assay. Applying focus assay after 10 min of inactivation, however, gave 6.0 \u00d7 103 focus forming units and 1.2 \u00d7 104 focus forming units for inactivation with absolute ethanol and a 70% ethanol solution, respectively. Peracetic acid is a strong oxidizing biocide with rapid biocidal action at relatively low concentrations. PUUV was inactivated by peracetic acid at a concentration of 1% in a timeframe of 10 min but due to the hazardous nature of this product, caution has to be taken when using this product in standard laboratory practice. Inactivation of PUUV by sodium hypochloride was complete with a 1% solution. Sodium hypochloride can be used against a wide variety of microbial and viral organisms (Sopwith et al., 2002), but it can be corrosive for stainless steel surfaces. Dettol\u00ae or parachlorometaxylenol, a common household disinfectant, was effective against PUUV, in a 1% (v/v) solution. Successful inactivation with Dettol\u00ae of several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses has been described (Wood and Payne, 1998). In solution, Virkon\u00aeS is activated to form hypochlorous acid, which has been shown to be a strong oxidizing agent (Spickett et al., 2000). This study has demonstrated that Virkon\u00aeS is effective for inactivating PUUV at the lowest (1%) concentration tested. Moreover, a 1% solution of Virkon\u00aeS is classified as a non-irritant to the skin and eyes (McCormick and Maheshwari, 2004). Clidox\u00ae (chlorine dioxide) is an alternative to chlorine as a primary disinfectant. It is a strong oxidant reported to be effective against several bacteria and viruses (Eleraky et al., 2002, Li et al., 2004, Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005). Clidox\u00ae was shown to be effective for inactivating PUUV at the lowest concentration tested (1% solution). Although the use of chlorine dioxide has some disadvantages including the oxidation of iron surfaces and the formation of organic halides, its use can be recommended since, like Virkon\u00aeS, it is effective against several bacteria and viruses including PUUV. Halamid-d\u00ae is a disinfectant used against bacteria, viruses and fungi. It is proven to be effective against SARS coronavirus (www.halamid.com). A 1% solution of Halamid-d\u00ae was found to be effective against PUUV in this study.",

A recognized problem with RT-PCR and qRT-PCR detection of viral RNA, however, is that the presence of RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus (Gassilloud et al., 2003, Suarez et al., 2003). Applying an RNase/proteinase K digestion before RNA extraction, allows the detection of intact viral particles only, i.e. infectious virus. The concentration of virus found by using qRT-PCR correlated with the focus forming units found by focus assay. The qRT-PCR detects specific viral RNA strains, whereas a focus assay is based on the ability of a single infectious virus particle to give rise to a macroscopic visual amount of virus particles. Specifically, a single virus particle, infecting a single cell, will give rise to new virus particles, which can infect surrounding cells. During the initial incubation of a focus assay, the surrounding cells can also be infected. If new virus particles are produced by the surrounding cells, the different foci will be recognized as one. This can explain possibly the lower concentration of focus forming units found, in comparison with the particle-associated virus genome equivalents as found with the qRT-PCR.",
