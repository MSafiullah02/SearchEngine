However, the effectiveness and reliability of these approaches are not fully understood when the business environment is undergoing a major crisis. Building on organizational adaptation, strategic fit, and organizational decline streams of literature, we develop a framework that examines exploration and exploitation in crisis contexts. We argue that the severity of crisis a firm is exposed to acts as a positive contingency for the impact of exploration on firm performance level and variability, and as a negative contingency for exploitation's level and variability effects. Employing the multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression model on the data from 500 Russian SMEs, we test the proposed theoretical framework linking exploration and exploitation activities to the distribution of firm performance under different conditions of the firm-specific crisis severity. The results provide an improved understanding of strategic management approaches under economic crises and related turbulence.",

            "text": "There is a broad consensus that firms today face environments characterized by high levels of uncertainty, instability, and turbulence (Schilke, 2014; Wright, Filatotchev, Hoskisson, & Peng, 2005) . It is also well established that firm performance depends largely on the fit between the strategies it employs and the environment under which these strategies are employed (e.g., Zajac, Kraatz, & Bresser, 2000) . When the environment changes abruptly, firms need to adapt their behavior to the new circumstances. A country-wide or global economic crisis is a good example of a sudden environmental jolt that makes firms reconsider their strategic behavior to cope with the economic downturn (Archibugi, Filippetti, & Frenz, 2013; Battisti, Beynon, Pickernell, & Deakins, 2019; Doern, Williams, & Vorley, 2019; Kunc & Bhandari, 2011; Pollard & Hotho, 2006; Smallbone, Deakins, Battisti, & Kitching, 2012) . Responding to an economic crisis, firms may employ two distinct approaches to organizational adaptation: exploration and exploitation (Gupta, Smith, & Shalley, 2006; March, 1991; Ngo, Bucic, Sinha, & Lu, 2019) . In a seminal study, March (1991) broadly defined exploration as \"search, variation, risk-taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and innovation,\" contrasting it with exploitation, which involves \"refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation and execution\" (p. 71). Exploration and exploitation have been shown to provide distinct strategic paths to improved firm performance in stable environments (Gonzalez & de Melo, 2018) . During times of stability, firm outcomes associated with exploration are more variable and remote in time, while the outcomes associated with exploitation are more certain and closer in time (He & Wong, 2004) . Furthermore, prior studies have recognized the \"tension between the need to explore to be different and the need to exploit to be more effective\" (Parida, Lahti, & Wincent, 2016, p. 148) , providing different performance outcomes in terms of level and variability of performance. Most studies suggest that firms should consider both exploration and exploitation, establishing ambidexterity, which is central to enhancing performance (He & Wong, 2004) . However, some studies report that firms that pursue either exploration or exploitation outperform those that combine these activities (Ebben & Johnson, 2005) , or that the expected exploration-exploitation complementarity is not materializing (e.g., Ngo et al., 2019) . As such, the investigation of whether the established performance consequences of exploration and exploitation hold during periods of economic crisis and severe market conditions is warranted, as environmental conditions may dramatically shape their role in firm performance (Auh & Menguc, 2005; Marino, Aversa, Mesquita, & Anand, 2015) .",

We expect this perspective to provide important understanding; in fact, the organizational decline literature emphasizes that the strategic fit of firms' responses to the decline driven by \"environmental jolts\" is decisive to economic performance, e.g., in the context of acquisitions (see Trahms et al., 2013 Trahms et al., , p. 1295 Wan & Yiu, 2009) . By focusing on exploration and exploitation strategies adopted by firms, we aim to provide new insight into how firms may position themselves better to fit volatile and hostile conditions such as economic crises. This research provides insights into several important research questions within strategic management: (1) how do exploration and exploitation relate to the level of firm performance and performance variability during an economic crisis; and (2) how does the firm-specific crisis severity (the impact of the economic crisis on a particular firm) shape these relationships? To address our research questions, we use the comprehensive national random sample of 500 Russian SMEs collected during the period of economic crisis and political sanctions (spanning the time interval of 2014-2016), supplementing the survey-based measures of the exploration and exploitation constructs with the objective financial data.",

First, we supplement the current knowledge of how exploration and exploitation affect the overall level of firm performance with a nuanced understanding of the impact of these approaches on the variability of firm performance. This step represents a substantial departure from the existing approaches that concentrate on the \"mean\" impacts only [with the only exception being the simulation study of Uotila (2017) and the variance-focusing article by Parida et al. (2016)] . Understanding both the level (conditional mean) and variability (residual deviation from the conditional mean) provides a better understanding of what outcomes can be expected from exploration and exploitation strategies. For this, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the relatively rarely used yet crucially informative multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression method (Harvey, 1976) , which provides useful applications in the future studies of entrepreneurial actions and strategies regarding their effects on firm performance outcomes and related variability.",

            "text": "Second, our study enriches the understanding of the role of exploration and exploitation under volatile and hostile environments, such as during economic downturns. While much research has been focused on the performance outcomes of exploration and exploitation under various environmental contingencies (e.g., Jansen, Van Den Bosch, & Volberda, 2006; Marino et al., 2015; Posen & Levinthal, 2012) , as well as on simultaneous exploration and exploitation (i.e., ambidexterity; see Junni, Sarala, Taras, & Tarba, 2013) , our study provides useful evidence of firm-specific effects of these external conditions. In particular, our examination of firm-specific crisis severity provides a valuable view of how firms might seek a better strategic fit with their environment with exploration and exploitation strategies that take into account the firm's own situation within the broader crisis. We find that exploration strategies improve firms' performance under high crisis severity, but on the other hand, the variability of the performance also rises. Further, we find that exploitation strategies decline in their performance under high crisis severity, while the variability of performance goes down. Thus, exploration strategies seem to be beneficial under crisis, but come with a cost of higher volatility, while exploitation leads to \"reliable decline of performance.\" With these results, our study provides more insights into the established literature of organizational decline, which has shown that the strategic fit of firms' actions under challenging business environments has important performance implications (Moulton, Thomas, & Pruett, 1996; Wan & Yiu, 2009 ). Our results complement these views by providing evidence of the firmspecific crisis severity within a broader economic crisis context, providing more understanding of the strategic fit of firms' actions in under challenging environments.",

A well-developed literature on strategic adaptation suggests threat perception can be considered as a catalyst for a strategic response (e.g., Gilbert, 2005; Laskovaia, Marino, Shirokova, & Wales, 2019) . Furthermore, threat rigidity theory predicts the reactions top managers have when they are faced with external threat (Osiyevskyy & Dewald, 2018; Staw et al., 1981) and suggests that decision-makers tend to employ existing schemas under threat, thereby exhibiting rigidity-inability to recognize innovative responses (Barnett & Pratt, 2000) . The performance implications of such strategic behaviors depend on the firm's operating environment and in crisis contexts, defensive strategies can protect firm survival (H\u00e5konsson, Klaas, & Carroll, 2013) . However, a number of studies have observed that threat can also be an antecedent of the more proactive strategic behaviors that enable firms to overcome inertia (Beliaeva, Shirokova, Wales, & Gafforova, 2020; Laskovaia et al., 2019; McKinley et al., 2014; Shirokova et al., 2019 Shirokova et al., , 2020 .",

In such environments, organizations have to readjust their strategies and behaviors with new realities in order to prevent performance declines and ensure business survival (McKinley et al., 2014; Trahms et al., 2013) . Or in other words, they have to improve their strategic fit to the environment (Fainshmidt et al., 2019) if they wish to survive in the new situation. The existing studies in SMEs' responses to economic recession are scant and tend to focus on either vulnerability or the resilience of such firms ( et al., 2012) . According to the vulnerability view, SMEs are highly sensitive to external threats because of the \"liability of smallness\" (Aldrich & Auster, 1986) . Therefore, the probability of failure among such firms is typically much higher, in comparison with larger, wellestablished firms (Davidsson & Gordon, 2016) . On the other hand, in the resilience view, SMEs are more flexible, closer to the market and their customers, and, therefore, less negatively affected by an economic downturn (Beliaeva et al., 2020; Latham, 2009; Shirokova et al., 2019; Smallbone et al., 2012) . These two views correspond with the views in the organizational decline literature, which have contrasted between organizational decline as a catalyst or inhibitor for adaptation and innovation (McKinley et al., 2014; Sarkar & Osiyevskyy, 2018) .",

            "text": "Collectively, the findings illustrate that appropriate strategies can protect even small firms against a declining environment. Nevertheless, an economic crisis presents small firms with a major dilemma: cut costs and/or rely on existing resources in order to maintain survival in the short term or invest in innovative activities in order to create capabilities for long-term viability (Sariol & Abebe, 2017; Smallbone et al., 2012) . While we already know a lot about the determinants and the process that lead to different types of firm behavior under crisis and decline (see, e.g., McKinley et al., 2014; Trahms et al., 2013) , the important question we want to address relates to the consequences of firms' strategic actions once they are selected, and under a varying crisis severity for those firms while those strategies are deployed. Thus, in our study, we focus on two types of strategies SMEs may employ to achieve a better fit with the changing environment under conditions of a major economic downturn that illustrate this dilemma-exploration and exploitation (March, 1991) . Below, we provide a brief literature review on exploration/exploitation-firm performance relationship in order to introduce the research gap in the existing literature related to the performance implications of these strategies in the context of an economic crisis.",

Exploration allows the firm to create completely new opportunities, knowledge, and competencies, whereas exploitation focuses on the utilization of its existing opportunities, knowledge, and competencies (Abebe & Angriawan, 2014; Uotila, 2017) . A fundamental question in the exploration-exploitation literature concerns the impact of these strategies on organizational performance. Since March (1991) seminal work, scholars have long been arguing that exploration and exploitation produce differential performance outcomes. However, until recently, empirical research on the performance implications of exploration and exploitation has been scarce. Few studies demonstrate divergent effects of exploration and exploitation on firm performance. For instance, based on a survey of 206 manufacturing firms, Auh and Menguc (2005) report that exploration contributes to long-term performance, whereas exploitation is associated with short-term performance. Another example is the case study of a large European financial services firm, demonstrating that the impact of exploratory and exploitative innovations on firm performance is moderated by environmental dynamism and competitiveness (Jansen et al., 2006) . However, Posen and Levinthal (2012) have warned that environmental turbulence \"is not a self-evident call for strategies of greater exploration\" (p. 587). Indeed, several simulation studies suggest that environmental change undermines exploration efforts because it can devaluate existing knowledge while disregarding new knowledge developed through exploration (Kim & Rhee, 2009; Posen & Levinthal, 2012) . Moreover, under some circumstances, the most appropriate response to environmental turbulence is a focus on the exploitation of existing knowledge rather than the exploration of new opportunities. In addition, a recent study by Marino et al. (2015) shows that environmental change-considered as radical industry regulatory changes-negatively moderates the exploration-performance relationship.",

However, this emphasis on explaining the level of performance (i.e., mean of resulting performance distribution) neglects the substantial simultaneous impact of these strategies on the variance of performance.

For example, resource-constrained small and medium enterprises cannot sustain getting to the left-hand tail of the wide performance distribution, and as such, their managers predictably shy away from engaging in activities with high variability of outcomes. However, high variability also enables the possibility of getting abnormally high returns (e.g., \"blockbuster\" products), and thus it is a sought-after property leading to increase of returns at the levels of aggregation above a particular firm (e.g., a portfolio of an investor, corporate-level performance, or economy as a whole). In other words, performance variability at the level of particular firms creates the variation of performance in their population, which allows employment of the proper selection and retention mechanisms at the higher levels, leading to the overall system's development thanks to filtering out the unsuccessful firms (Aldrich & Ruef, 2006; Levinthal & Marino, 2015) .",

They claim that the performance variance is very problematic for entrepreneurial firms in the conditions of highly dynamic environments and suggest that firms \"should carefully consider how much they explore to be as different as possible and how much they exploit to be as effective as possible\" (p. 1147).

Moreover, exploration diverts resources from leveraging current capabilities to the slow processes of learning and developing the new ones, resulting in the opportunity cost of de-emphasizing exploitation. Of course, exploration sometimes leads to positive performance outcomes thanks to discovering new opportunities, gaining important market or technological knowledge, developing new unique competencies and expanding the customer base (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1997; Lubatkin, Simsek, Ling, & Veiga, 2006) .

Performance implications of exploration and exploitation during an economic crisis: The moderating role of firm-specific crisis severity A macro-level crisis (be it an economic downturn or industry-wide disruption) is a period of unexpected and unpredictable changes in the external environment requiring urgent responses from incumbent firms to maintain the strategic fit (Doern et al., 2019; Vaaler & McNamara, 2004) . However, the impact of the crisis in the external environment on particular firms is not homogenous, with firm-level peculiarities determining the degree of impact and threat (Paunov, 2012) . The studies of SMEs in crisis contexts corroborate this general view about the differential effect of macro-level adversity on incumbent firms (Osiyevskyy & Dewald, 2018; Peric & Vitezic, 2016; Smallbone et al., 2012) . While some SMEs find themselves in major misfit with the environment and suffer major revenue decline and losses, the other part of firms thrive amidst the adversity. As such, although the economy-or industry-wide downturn serves as a general, exogenous shock for all players, its effect is heterogonous between them, and hence must be assessed at the level of a particular SME. Considering this nuance, we explicitly argue that within the context of a broader economic crisis, firms will encounter different levels of firm-specific crisis severity-that is, there are differences between firms of how severely the available financial and other resources are constrained due to the crisis. More formally, in this study, we operationalize firm-specific crisis severity as a drop in revenues of the firm during the crisis, which creates important contingency implications for how well the potential strategies the firms employ fit the context of the economic crisis. Moreover, while an economic downturn presents dangers to firm performance and survival, it also may create opportunities to capitalize on (Archibugi et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2018; Beliaeva et al., 2020; Shirokova et al., 2019) . Firms may respond to an economic crisis by either proactively addressing the environmental changes through bold, radical initiatives (employing explorative actions) or initiating internal adjustment actions aimed at incremental and reliable adaptation to the environmental pressures (adopting exploitative actions).",

In such contexts, the allocation of scarce resources towards an explorative search for new technological knowledge or markets becomes a preferred strategy, allowing building and leveraging new valuable capabilities that might improve the fit with the environment. Not surprisingly, the vast literature on exploration argues for and demonstrates the superiority of an exploration strategy in dynamic and hostile environments (e.g., Brown & Eisenhardt, 1997; Jansen et al., 2006; Posen & Levinthal, 2012) . In fact, several studies have shown that while firms, in general, tend to reduce explorative strategies under economic crises, adopting explorative alignment can help firms to overcome the crisis and improve their innovation performance as well as turnover recovery (Ahn et al., 2018; Archibugi et al., 2013; Paunov, 2012) . However, the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in crisis situations (Sarkar & Osiyevskyy, 2018) are also likely to amplify the inherent uncertainty of the exploration activities; hence, strengthening their variance-boosting property.

The Russian economy in this period (2014-2016) was in a crisis state for several reasons. First, foreign countries (most notably, the U.S. and E.U. members) introduced economic and political sanctions against Russia, leading to a sudden decrease in the number of contracts, economic interactions, and business activities of Russian firms with foreign counterparts. Second, the global price of oil rapidly decreased by more than 60%, and this major negative change in the price of the main export commodity substantively affected the country's federal budget. Not surprisingly, the growth of the Russian gross domestic product (GDP) stalled, the national currency devaluated in half, and the unemployment and inflation rates ballooned.",

Taking into account the peculiarities of our empirical context, we selected firm revenue growth as the most appropriate, conventionally used indicator of performance and success of SMEs (Chandler, McKelvie, & Davidsson, 2009; Hmieleski & Corbett, 2008; Wales, Patel, & Lumpkin, 2013) . The reason for this decision is that the other performance measures (e.g., profitability measures such as ROE or ROA, or growth in total assets, net assets, or profit) might be subject to major biases related to accounting practices, particularly in a sample of private firms in a developing economy. As will be discussed in the following section (Estimation approach), we assess the firm performance level using Gibrat's growth model (Sorenson & S\u00f8rensen, 2001) , with logarithm of firm revenue in 2016 as the outcome variable, and logarithm of firm revenue in 2015 (i.e., lagged dependent variable) as the crucial predictor accounting for all firm-specific time-invariant characteristics. The presence of the lagged dependent variable in the regression specification implies the existence of a firm-level growth trend and that all other predictors will determine the deviation from this trend (i.e., acceleration or deceleration of firm revenue growth). Alternatively, we could have measured revenue growth as the absolute or relative difference in sales between 2015 and 2016. Yet, this is not a recommended practice (e.g., Sapienza, Parhankangas, & Autio, 2004) , as the relative measures yield inflated growth figures for smaller firms, while absolute measures yield inflated results for larger firms (Young, Smith, & Grimm, 1996) . Therefore, in line with Sorenson and S\u00f8rensen (2001) , the firm revenue growth was measured by including the lagged dependent variable to the regression equation.",

The advantage of this method over alternatives (e.g., assessing standard deviation of sales: Parida et al. (2016) , Wales et al. (2013) , which is, in essence, the residual variance over the sample or group mean) is that it is based on assessing the variability as deviations from conditional mean that cannot be well approximated by the sample mean or some group mean. For example, if a particular predictor strongly positively affects the firm performance, observations high on this predictor will have predictably high values of the dependent variable (conditional means and actual values), but also predictably large positive deviations from the sample mean. The latter should not indicate a lack of reliability but would still get a high score on variability if it is measured as deviation from the sample mean rather than from the conditional (predicted) mean (see detailed discussion of this issue in S\u00f8rensen (2002) ). In other words, the approach embraced in this study of assessing variability as residual deviation from conditional mean is the most accurate way of capturing this construct (Sorenson & S\u00f8rensen, 2001; S\u00f8rensen, 2002) .",

Our investigation reveals the distinct implications of these strategies on the level of firm performance (i.e., conditional mean), as well as the variability of performance. We find that exploration, on average, lowers the firm performance but simultaneously increases the performance variability, creating by this means the necessary conditions for both achieving abnormally high returns (right-hand side of performance distribution) and suffering major losses (left-hand side of performance distribution). This finding supports our hypotheses on the role of explorative strategy as providing more alternatives, but also reducing performance, at least in the near term.",

In our main analyses, we operationalize firm-specific crisis severity as a drop of revenue, which we use as a moderator in examining the effects of exploration and exploitation on the level and variability of firm performance. We find that crisis severity has a strong moderating role, changing the utility of exploration and exploitation strategies. In particular, we find that under a high level of crisis severity, exploration strategies are significantly and positively related to the level of firm performance as well as to its variability (see Fig. 3a and b) . Under low levels of crisis severity, the exploration strategies lead to a reduction of performance, as well as a reduction in variability. Furthermore, we find that exploitation strategies under high crisis severity lead to reductions of both firm performance level as well as variability. On the other hand, when crisis severity is low, exploitation strategies lead to increase in performance level coupled with increase in its variability. Overall, these results mean that under difficult conditions, firms that focus on exploitation can expect reliable (i.e., low variance) but declining performance. However, exploring under crisis seems to provide access to major opportunities to achieve high performance, along with a \"cost\" of increased variability.",

Organizational decline literature has shown that firms have a variety of ways to approach crisis and decline, including decline as a catalyst or an inhibitor for adaptation (McKinley et al., 2014) . Following the strategic fit approach (Trahms et al., 2013; Zajac et al., 2000) our findings provide particular evidence not on the antecedents to firm a -Impact on conditional mean b -Impact on variability adaptation choices like much of the decline literature, but rather to the consequences of particular strategic choices under different firm-specific crisis severity contexts. As we show that when firms are going through a severe crisis with falling financial performance, our findings suggest that they should explore ways to capitalize on the crisis. This insight is aligned with the dynamic capabilities view, in that more explorative strategic approaches are the preferable way when environmental uncertainty grows (e.g., Ahn et al., 2018; Schilke, 2014) , as well with the evidence that firms able to adopt explorative approaches during an economic crisis might end up better off than other firms (Archibugi et al., 2013; Paunov, 2012 ). An explorative approach implies some risks, however, as the variability of performance rises. Therefore, if the aim of a firm under severe crisis is to secure a reliable, even if slightly falling stream of revenue, then exploitation is the preferred strategy. Therefore, it can be concluded that an exploration strategy allows finding potential ways to escape the falling performance, but this comes with a cost of increased risk. Thus, performance reliability and opportunities can be seen as substitutive strategic alternatives for firms that suffer the consequences of an economic downturn.",

First, we provide a more overarching understanding of the performance impact of exploration and exploitation than in the previous literature. Thus far, the literature has provided a lot of understanding of the individual and joint effects of exploration and exploitation on firm performance (Jansen et al., 2006; Marino et al., 2015; Posen & Levinthal, 2012; Uotila, Maula, Keil, & Zahra, 2009 ). However, our study also involves the investigation of the variability of firm performance, which is an important but overlooked outcome of exploration and exploitation strategies (for exceptions, see Parida et al., 2016; Uotila, 2017) . We argue that understanding both the level and variability of firm performance is very relevant from both scholarly and managerial perspectives. If the benefits to performance come at the cost of higher variability and risk, the assessment of those outcomes can be made from a more informed approach. For various reasons, some firms might prefer lower performance if they can, at the same time, achieve a more reliable performance trajectory. On the other hand, some firms might be tempted to aim for higher performance. Our study thus provides important evidence of a previously overlooked aspect of performance variability (or reliability) in exploration and exploitation research.",

Here, our contribution can be viewed through the lenses of strategic fit, where firms' strategies provide better performance when they are well aligned with the external environment (e.g., Fainshmidt et al., 2019; Zajac et al., 2000) . Indeed, the organizational decline literature has already demonstrated that firms' actions' strategic fit to crisis environments has notable performance implications (Trahms et al., 2013; Wan & Yiu, 2009) . Here, firms' strategic fit is examined in an interesting research setting: a period of major economic crisis, of which we measured the crisis severity at the firm level and focused on particular adaptation strategies of exploration and exploitation. We find that given the right choices to employ explorative or exploitative strategies, firms can enhance their performance, often with the expense of increased variability. Existing research has already established that exploration-type strategies often better fit the dynamic environments (e.g., Jansen et al., 2006; Schilke, 2014) as well as provided evidence of the merits of innovative activities under economic downturn (Ahn et al., 2018; Archibugi et al., 2013; Shirokova et al., 2019) . Furthermore, organizational decline literature has suggested that firms benefit from different types of strategic actions in declining and growing industry conditions (McKinley et al., 2014; Trahms et al., 2013) . Our results provide a further enriched picture of firm behavior under crisis context regarding two canonical strategies-exploration and exploitation. Our results show that firms suffer from major crises to different extents, as we measure this firm-specific crisis severity effect in two alternative ways (sales decline as well as closeness to bankruptcy), finding consistent results with both measures. Importantly, we demonstrate how such crisis severity affects the outcomes (and strategic fit) of both of these strategies.",

For this, we discuss the multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression methodology (Harvey, 1976) , which-although not widely used in management-is broadly used in the economics field for assessing the impact of predictors on both level and variability of the outcome variable.",

The main implication is that exploration strategies might be beneficial under firm-specific crisis situations, especially for those firms that can stand the risks involved. Exploration will lead to higher variability of performance but provides the chance to grasp new opportunities. On the other hand, if the firm has a situation where it has a serious threat regarding its survival, and extra finances and resources are not likely available, choosing an exploitative strategy might be a better option. Under high crisis severity, exploitation leads to performance decline, but with a lower variation. Thus, if a firm can muddle through a period of declining performance via continuing exploitation, it might find new opportunities as the broader crisis situation is resolved. While these implications point to sufficiently clear strategic choices, in reality, the crisis situation involves other strategic elements to consider. For instance, it is advisable to also examine the firm's competitive situation as well as the broader economic context before deciding to place the bets on a mostly exploitative or explorative approach. Furthermore, when the economic shock is coupled with other types of disruptions such as the recently witnessed global pandemic (due to COVID-19 virus), the firm-specific implications are likely to be further dispersed based on the industry affiliation, geographical location, or legislative regime in a particular institutional context.",

First, the insights of the studies of organizational ambidexterity (He & Wong, 2004; Ho et al., 2020; Koryak, Lockett, Hayton, Nicolaou, & Mole, 2018; Lubatkin et al., 2006; Stettner & Lavie, 2014) strongly suggest that the balance or combination of exploration and exploitation might have a major impact on firm performance, above and beyond the impacts of these strategies individually. Although our additional analyses (see online Appendix A) fail to support this prediction, this nonsignificant result might be driven by the context-dependence of the ambidexterity-performance relationship. As such, a more nuanced investigation of combined implications of exploration and exploitation on firm performance level and variability is warranted, and here our current paper might serve as the founding step establishing the distinct effects of the strategies.",

In particular, the possible unobservable industry-and firm-level characteristics might simultaneously affect the hypothesized predictors (exploration, exploitation, crisis severity) and the outcome variable (revenue growth and revenue variability). To mitigate this threat to internal validity, we performed a series of checks, such as accounting for a time lag between the measures of dependent and independent variables (to establish the temporal order) and using within-firm lagged dependent variable specification (to account for all time-invariant firmand industry-level covariates). Moreover, we added a wide list of control variables, the most obvious drivers of both exploration/exploitation and performance, such as the main effect of crisis severity (as probably the main driver of firm's adaptive actions) and other characteristics of the firm's environment. Nevertheless, the causal claims of the paper require verification in experimental, quasi-experimental, or simulationbased settings.",
