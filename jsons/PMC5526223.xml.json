The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus belongs to the betacoronavirus genus which also hosts the pandemic 2003\u20132005 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that affected more than 30 countries [3]. These viruses have large, complex positive-sense RNA genomes that encode replicase, structural and accessory proteins. The replicase protein is cleaved by a viral protease to form the 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins [4]. The nonstructural proteins (nsps) are responsible for replication of the positive-sense RNA genome, transcription of subgenomic RNAs, and other RNA processing activities. Activities necessary for interference with host cell innate immune responses have been identified [5, 6].",

This protein harbors one papain-like cysteine protease, transmembrane regions, RNA-binding proteins , and one or more macrodomains [7\u20139]. The macrodomains are of significant interest with respect to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) interaction. These domains comprise a multifunctional protein family that act on NAD+ metabolites [10, 11]. They act as modulators of posttranslational modifications, including PARylation\n, mono(ADP-ribosylation) , and related modifications. In addition to their known roles in PAR binding, some macrodomains function as enzymes, for example in O-acetyl ADP-ribose deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribose hydrolase reactions [12]. The catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) glycosylase is also a macrodomain [13]. These domains have been termed readers, erasers and interpreters of PARylation and mARylation [10]. Divergent macrodomains have been discovered with new functions, including nucleic acid binding [9, 14] and protein\u2013protein interaction [15], suggesting that this protein family represents a conserved structural scaffold on which much functional variation may occur.",

            "text": "In viruses, the nonstructural protein 3 has several roles. Sequence analysis identified this protein as subject to positive selection during coronavirus evolution and adaptation to new hosts [16]. Other lines of evidence show this protein being involved in inhibition of host innate immune responses [17\u201319]. The macrodomain of this protein is conserved among coronaviruses, hepatitis virus, alphavirus, and rubella virus [20\u201322]. This protein is able to dephosphorylate ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphate; the importance of this reaction to viral infection is unknown. Some conserved sequence motifs, such as a \u201cGGG\u201d and the \u201cSAGIF\u201d which is involved in the stabilization of the phosphate groups, and \u201cNAAN\u201d motif which employs the second asparagine to form hydrogen bonds with the terminal ribose, are characteristic for this protein family [23]. In some viral macrodomains, the latter asparagine participates in the dephosphorylation reaction [10]. Other functional residues are variable, and more difficult to identify on the basis of sequence [10]. The macrodomain is important to infection through interactions with the host immune system: deletion or mutation of the conserved macrodomain led to a loss of virulence [18, 24\u201326]. In the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), deletion of either the second macrodomain or the domain of unknown function led to a significant loss of viral RNA synthesis, indicating a critical role in the viral replicase-transcriptase complex [14].",

Beginning with an unknown protein or nucleotide sequence to be analyzed, similar sequences may be identified using a BLAST search [46]. If the sequence does not yield many hits, an iterative method such as PSI-BLAST or PHI-BLAST [47] may be employed. Building on these results, a fold prediction algorithm may also be used to detect remote sequence similarities. FFAS (Fold and Function Assignment) incorporates this method [28]. FFAS performs protein sequence profile alignment to detect low levels of sequence similarity. All sequences used in and FFAS search must contain less than 1000 amino acids. Options are available for multiple sequences or for a pairwise sequence alignment. Several different databases may be searched, for example the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [48], Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) [49], Protein Families (Pfam) [50], Classification Of proteins in complete Genomes (COG) [51], and structural genomics sequence collections as well as complete genomes of individual organisms. Search results include a score that is derived from the FFAS algorithm. The algorithm arranges the matching profile alignments, with those that have the highest confidence on top. An FFAS score of \u22129.5 or lower is the criterion for a protein to match a known fold [52].",

Initially, Jpred uses PSI-BLAST to create multiple alignments, and the JNet neural network algorithm [53] is then used to make secondary structure predictions based on the multiple sequence alignment combined with predicted solvent accessibility. A one-letter sequence is used or a file with multiple sequences can be uploaded (plain text, FASTA, MSF, BLC, or Batch). The size limit per sequence is 800 residues in plain text format. The results include the secondary structure prediction confidence for each residue. Secondary structure components are marked with the letter H for \u03b1-helix regions, E for \u03b2 strands and the letter B for buried residues. Each residue will also have a reliability score from 0 to 9, in which residues with a high score are predicted with higher confidence than those with lower scores [54].

            "text": "The likely locations of domain boundaries in proteins may be predicted by combining the analyses of protein sequences with these and other programs [55\u201357]. First, based on sequence alignments and conserved protein sequence motifs, putative macrodomains may be identified. Macrodomains share a globular structure of \u03b2-sheets flanked by \u03b1-helices. While several human, bacterial, and viral macrodomains have been found to share a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 architecture, many proteins in the macrodomain family contain additional \u03b1-helices and/or \u03b2-sheets in their folds [58]. The arrangement of these predicted secondary structures assists in identifying this protein family. Slight variations, such as the addition of a single \u03b1-helix at the beginning or end of the protein may occur [54, 59]. For example, in the SARS-CoV, the SUD-N domain has a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 fold whereas the SUD-M domain has a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 fold [54]. In addition, conserved protein sequence motifs are associated with the macrodomain family. For example, the macrodomain ADP-ribose hydrolases employ the backbones of certain residues such as \u201cGGGV\u201d and \u201cGIYG\u201d to coordinate with the phosphate groups of ADP-ribose [60]. The MacroD1-like proteins employ a conserved aspartate and histidine as part of a catalytic triad to deprotonate a water molecule which can act as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl carbon of an ADP-ribosylated protein [61, 62]. Moreover, additional motifs are involved in the binding of ADP-ribose: the \u201cNAAN\u201d motif stabilizes the distal ribose through the sidechains of the second asparagine, the \u201cSAGIF\u201d stabilizes the two phosphate groups , and in the \u201cDAIQ\u201d motif, the carbonyl group of the aspartate forms hydrogen bonds with the adenine moiety of ADP-ribose in the binding pocket [23, 59, 63]. PAR glycosylases also contain a conserved \u201cGGG\u201d motif used to coordinate ADP-ribose but employ a \u201cQEE\u201d sequence where the two glutamate residues and a conserved N-terminal aspartate are responsible for trapping a water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on an ADP-ribose substrate for PAR cleavage [64, 65].",

This algorithm identifies remote fold similarities, and together with secondary structure prediction, may be applied to identify domain boundaries. Predicted secondary structure patterns from Jpred [29], PSIPRED [30], and other programs can identify disordered loop regions that often correspond to a domain boundary. To ensure only the domain of interest is chosen and disordered tails are not introduced into the construct, only a few residues beyond the predicted domain are incorporated into the construct of interest. Typically, hydrophilic residues are chosen as endpoints in a protein domain, such as a serine or aspartic acid. For many biochemical and biophysical studies, it is also helpful to reduce the number of cysteines and prolines; if these residues are near a domain boundary, and are not conserved and/or necessary for the protein\u2019s activity. Cysteines oxidize to form disulfide bridges that can lead to protein oligomerization, while prolines introduce the possibility of conformational isomerization about the peptide bond. If cysteines are present in the sequence, reducing agents are introduced during purification. Prolines are not detectable in several common NMR experiments. At the N-terminus , destabilizing amino acids are avoided [66]. Disordered regions, domains, or proteins may also be predicted with software such as DISOPRED [31], SEG [32], or DisEMBL\u2122 [33] that is specifically designed to identify them.",

The sequence of the bat nonstructural protein 3, a large, multidomain protein, was analyzed by BLAST and FFAS. The sequence similarity to other proteins was searched by FFAS against the PDB database. As shown in Fig. 1, the sequence had strong similarity to known viral macrodomains. Secondary structure predictions from Jpred further showed a predicted secondary structure pattern consistent with that of a macrodomain. Multiple alignments identified conserved residues present in other macrodomains, such as the \u201cDA\u201d following the first \u03b2-sheet, the \u201cGGGI\u201d motif on the N-terminal end of \u03b1-helix 2, the \u201cNAAN\u201d that has the catalytically important second asparagine following \u03b2-sheet 2, and the \u201cSAGIF\u201d region N-terminal to \u03b1-helix 5. This was also supported by functional predictions, described in the next section. Using this information, we hypothesized that the bat coronavirus\nHKU4 nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) contains a conserved macrodomain. To isolate this domain and study the protein further, we predicted domain boundaries. These boundaries are shown in Fig. 1. These boundaries are chosen a few residues outside the predicted secondary structures to maintain the predicted globular fold.",

First, a structural analysis against PDB structures is conducted, where the top ten best alignments are provided in the output. Next, protein functions are from three independent libraries: ligand binding prediction confidence (C), enzyme classification (EC), and gene ontology (GO). These identifiers are scored based on the confidence of their prediction [38]. These identifiers are linked to specific binding sites and protein functions from their respective databases. A description and related proteins with similar function are associated with each identifier.",

ProFunc uses PDB input files or identifiers to predict likely biochemical function [43]. The server will run a PDBsum analysis [73], a server that provides a brief structural overview, for every ProFunc submission . ProFunc uses sequence and structural batch processes to compare against known protein structures [43]. ProFunc also uses 3D template searches of known protein ligand interactions to predict function [43]. Once ProFunc is complete, a color-coded output is produced. The output provides predictions on conserved motifs and folds, enzymatic activity, ligand binding site, and binding pocket similarities. Next, SIFTER (Statistical Inference of Function Through Evolutionary Relationships) is a server that makes predictions based on statistical methods [42]. Only a FASTA sequence is required for this tool. SIFTER will compile a list of proteins that match the queried sequence and organize the related protein function through a confidence score. The list of significant protein function matches is classified by a GO identifier which offers further explanation for each shared function. Lastly, RaptorX, a protein threading program, uses protein sequences to predict structure, binding sites, residue contact maps, solvent accessibility per residue, and structure properties through a multistep threading approach [74]. RaptorX constructs a structure template list from known proteins and optimizes the energy function to determine the quality of each predicted structure [39]. Using pairwise interaction preferences, RaptorX aligns the input sequence to the backbone of templates to output a final predicted structure [75]. The structural prediction method is employed by computational learning models that determine solvent accessibility, structured and disordered regions or the entire queried sequence and predicts enzymatic activity and ligands that may bind to the protein sequence [40]. To use RaptorX, only a name, email, and FASTA sequence is needed. Results from the structural prediction will provide a summary prediction of secondary structure, solvent accessible residues, and disordered regions. Results from the binding tool provide a list of ligands that are predicted to bind to the protein. Furthermore, the predicted contacts tool provides a contact map, top five predicted models in .pdb format, and an interactive model of the protein via a Jmol viewer.",

These results are shown in Table 3. The prediction of this protein as a macrodomain is consistent from both I-TASSER, ProFunc, and RaptorX analysis. Predicted functions included phosphate metabolic processes, hydrolase activity, and nucleic acid recognition, which suggests that this domain is involved with ADP-ribose and/or nucleic acid recognition by the consensus results from COACH, SIFTER, and ProFunc servers. BioLiP, COACH, and RaptorX provide consistent predictions that ADP-ribose is a likely to be a ligand for this domain.

To increase the predictive capabilities of BindN, evolutionary data from a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) derived from a PSI-Blast search was introduced [77]. The most recent addition of support vector machines (SVMs), a set of learning algorithms, further increased the server\u2019s sensitivity performance [37]. BindN only requires a primary sequence in FASTA format to run. Sensitivity and specificity parameters can be adjusted to increase the number of hits or reduce the number of false positives. The output will provide an assessment of binding propensity to DNA or RNA. A confidence value range from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest) and prediction marker for binding residues (+) and non-binding residues (\u2212) are indicated directly below each amino acid in the sequence.

The program searches all possible binding modes in the translational and rotational space between two molecules and evaluates each pose using an energy-based scoring function. The scoring function comprises interface atomic contact energy (IFACE) statistical potential, shape complementarity, and electrostatics [82].Structure submission: Users can input the two structures to be docked on the initial submission page. Protein 1 is fixed during the docking, so it is better to use the larger structure as the \u201cprotein,\u201d and protein 2 as the \u201cligand,\u201d or smaller structure. To input structures, one way is to specify PDB codes, if available, and the ZDOCK server can connect to the PDB database. The other way is to upload PDB files (see\nNote\n4). After submitting the PDB files, the user should select individual chains if a multimeric protein is considered.Selection of blocking/contacting residues. The user is asked to select residues that are involved in binding or to select residues that do not participate in binding interactions. This is an optional step to orient the ligand into possible binding sites. If experimental information is available regarding binding, it can be entered here. Upon selection, the residues can be highlighted in 3D visualization aided by Jmol [83].The ZDOCK output includes the PDB top ten models generated by the program and preprocessed input PDB files. In addition, the results feature a Jmol visualization of the top-ranked docking models by energy score, and the center-of-mass positions of the top 500 ligands. There is also the capability to visualize or download any individual complex from the output. Alternatively, users can generate more sets of PDB files for predicted complexes by using a Java program or an executable file which are available from the ZDOCK website (see\nNote\n5).Second, HADDOCK [84, 85] (High Ambiguity Driven protein\u2013protein DOCKing) is different from other ab initio docking methods such as ZDOCK because HADDOCK uses ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive docking processes. AIRS can be obtained from information about the proteins, such as NMR chemical shift perturbation data, mutagenesis data, or any information regarding the interaction interface. HADDOCK requires a Linux or Unix environment with CNS (Crystallographic and NMR system) [86] for generating experimental restraints. A web server is implemented to provide an interface with different levels of control over the docking process, termed Easy, Expert and Guru. The Easy interface is freely accessible to nonprofit users, while Expert and Guru require upgrade access given by the program administrators.\n",

Currently, HADDOCK uses CNS as its structure calculation engine, which requires a slightly different input file format compared to the PDB.

It is a conformational search-based program that employs a grid approximation of the nonbonded ligand-receptor interaction energy. A post- docking minimization is performed to return ten poses per ligand based on their energy score, distance and conformation. It provides extra precision (XP), standard precision (SP) and virtual high-throughput screening modes to trade off various needs for speed and accuracy.\nLigand and receptor preparation. Glide requires a preparation of receptor and ligand structures. The preparation is incorporated in the same Maestro suite as Glide. In the Maestro program, the user accesses the Protein Preparation Wizard and Ligand Preparation Wizard to perform this preparation. The goal is to check for missing atoms and connectivities from the NMR or X-ray crystallographic structures, assign the proper bond order, add hydrogens, and reduce multimeric proteins to a single unit. The ligand preparation will render two-dimensional chemical structures, such as ligand library files exported from molecule sketching programs (ChemDraw, Ghemical or PRODRG), to their three-dimensional forms with the preferred ionization states and correct stereochemistry (see\nNote\n9).Grid generation. The Glide program uses a grid map of the active site to search and dock ligands in an exhaustive manner [87\u201389]. Hence the grid map, which reflects the shape, electrostatic and other physical properties of the active site of the receptor, has to be ready before docking. The program provides a wizard called Receptor Grid Generation . The user employs a prepared receptor file from the Protein Preparation Wizard, then defines a Workspace box that will cover the active site of the receptor during the docking. The other options include positional constraints that dictate the presence of certain functional groups in specific regions.\nDocking. Setting up the Glide docking program involves selecting the grid file generated in step 2 and the ligand file or library prepared in step 1. The user then decides which docking mode to use and sets up the score penalties for conformational changes and torsions in docking the higher energy states of the ligand. The other important options to select are the extent of receptor flexibility during the docking and output formats for the resulting poses and scores.Results analysis. Glide provides an interface to view the resulting poses and contacts between ligand and receptor. This viewing mode can be opened by, in the Project Table, the options Entry, View Poses, and Setup. The user then may analyze each docked pose in the Workspace, along with its Glide score and contacts. The export function can output docked structures to other types of files, such as .mol and .pdb. Glide scores, ionization states and other energy terms can be output to a spreadsheet.\n",

All water molecules, including interacting ones, were removed and the protein was minimized with bound ligand in this example during the protein preparation. The interacting amino acid residues (D23, I24, N41, G47, G49, V50, S129, G131, I132, F133, N157), match experimentally determined ADP-binding motifs. In Fig. 2a, the D23 and I24 residues are shown to stabilize the adenine ring, the second asparagine (N41) from the \u201cNAAN\u201d motifs coordinates with the distal ribose, and both the \u201cGGG\u201d (G47-G48-G49) and the \u201cSAGIF\u201d (S129 -G131-I132-F133) motifs interact with the two phosphate groups in ADP-ribose binding.

FFAS and Jpred predictions, used to identify domain boundaries and produce a construct for study, are shown. Additional data regarding functionally important residues are identified by stars, from functional prediction programs described above. In addition, we identify residues that are conserved between the bat HKU4 macrodomain, and residues involved in interactions with ADP-ribose in the SARS-CoV macrodomain from the docking run shown in Fig. 2a, described below. These residues make key interactions with the ADP-ribose ligand. Comparatively, most of these key residues are conserved, as shown in Fig. 1. For example, the aspartate (D18) after the first \u03b2-strand, the second asparagine after the second \u03b2-strand (N36), the G42-G43-G44 loop before the second \u03b1-helix, the S124-A125-G126-I128-F129 region after the fifth \u03b2-strand, and the C-terminal asparagine (N153) are all predicted to be involved in the binding of ADP-ribose. Structurally, these residues align with conserved ADP-ribose binding regions of both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV macrodomains. For example, D18 in the HKU4\nmacrodomain aligns with D23 in the SARS-CoV macrodomain. The \u201cGGG\u201d motifs in both macrodomains, the G42-G43-G44 in HKU4 and the G47-G48-G49 in SARS, have an identical sequence alignment, further supporting the idea that the function of these proteins is similar.",

The affinity difference of the expressed protein versus cellular proteins allows for a highly selective separation. Another advantage of this purification method is its speed . Using the \u00c4KTA\u2122 purification system, we can quickly remove a large amount of impurities with ease. Below is a step-by-step description of nickel affinity purification using the \u00c4KTA\u2122 purifier system. Each step was conducted at 4 \u00b0C.Equilibrate the purification lines by executing \u201cPumpWashBasic\u201d in the Pump dialog box for both Line A and Line B in water. Wash column, detector, lines, and system with filtered, degassed water so that no ethanol remains in the system. Equilibrate the column with 5 column volumes (CVs) of running buffer. Execute \u201cAutoZeroUV\u201d in the \u201cAlarms and Monitors\u201d dialog box to set a baseline value of zero UV absorbance. Set a pressure maximum for the column of 0.3 MPa.To load sample on column, the P-960 sample pump collection tube is placed in running buffer and equilibrated with a 15 mL volume. Place the P-960 collection tube in the sample and start a flow to the column with a 1 mL/min flow rate. Increase flow rate to 5 mL/min in 1 mL/min increments. Fraction sizes of 3\u201310 mL are collected for SDS-PAGE\nanalysis (see\nNote\n14).After all of the sample has been loaded, the P-960 is turned off and an additional 10 CV of running buffer is passed over the column to wash away any unbound impurities from the column.The desired protein is eluted from the column using a shallow gradient from 100% running buffer to 100% elution buffer. The gradient should reach 100% elution buffer in a minimum of 10 CV for optimal resolution.Run 10 CV of elution buffer to ensure that the entire protein sample has eluted from the column.Wash column with 5 CV of running buffer followed by 10 CV of filtered, degassed water to regenerate the column. Column can be reused for another purification, or, if this is followed with 20% ethanol, stored.\n",

Inactive protein aggregates are separated and removed [93].Attach 50-mL Superloop\u2122 to \u00c4KTA\u2122 purifier and load the concentrated protein sample into sample chamber. To load sample, allow the main pump (Line A) to fill the superloop with buffer. After filled, turn the injector valve to \u201cINJECT\u201d and inject sample with a plastic syringe into the inject valve port. Once all of the sample has been added, turn the injector valve to \u201cLOAD\u201d. Load the sample to the HiLoad\u2122 26/600 Superdex\u2122 column at 1 ml/min. Increase flow rate to 2.6 mL/min without exceeding 0.3 MPa. Flow 1.5 CV of running buffer through the column. Collect fractions.Repeat SDS-PAGE to identify fractions with purified protein. Pool fractions.Using a new concentrator, add ultra-pure water and spin in concentrator for 10 min to rinse membrane preservatives from membrane 3 times. Concentrate pooled fractions until total volume is 500 \u03bcL. Spin at a maximum of 6000 \u00d7 g for 20 min intervals. Use pipette to mix retentate after each spin. Continue centrifugation until sample volume is 600 \u03bcL.As a final step of purification, recombinant overexpressed HKU4 domain purification was completed via size-exclusion chromatography. Because SEC is based on the molecular size of a protein, the elution time of a protein can be calibrated to determine its molecular weight (smaller proteins have a longer path and elute later while larger proteins have a shorter path and elute earlier) [93]. The estimated elution volume of an 18 kDa protein is 245 mL based on molecular weight standards, and the resolved peak at 250 mL is the purified protein. In Fig. 3, the molecular weight of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE\nanalysis and also showed the protein sample did not contain detectable impurities . The secondary peak at 330 mL is indicative of low MW impurities that were present in the protein sample prior to SEC ; these were too low in concentration to appear on the gel.\n\n",

Rinse the tube three times with buffer before placing the sample in the tube. Ensure no bubbles are present in the NMR tube.The STD-NMR experiment is a commonly used ligand screening technique for rapid analysis of protein\u2013ligand interactions. This method is based on the transfer of magnetization from protein to ligand [96]. This process occurs by the application of a low-power radiofrequency pulse to the protein [96]. This saturation builds up through the entire protein through intramolecular 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect transfer. This saturation will also transfer to other protons located close to the protein in a binding pocket [101]. Thus, ligands that bind to a selectively irradiated protein will also become saturated. Experimentally, this process is useful because the saturated protons from a bound ligand dissociate, where they relax more slowly than in the bound state [101]. The saturation may be observed in a difference spectrum. The spectrum with on-resonance saturation is subtracted from the spectrum with off-resonance saturation [102]. The difference spectrum contains only signals from the ligand involved in the binding event. Consequently, this method has become widely used to identify compounds that bind to proteins of interest, and to carry out epitope mapping of binding compounds .\n",

Once ligand is added to the protein sample, changes in the spectrum due to ligand binding may be observed [103]. In a [15N,1H]-HSQC, each signal results from a covalently bonded 15N,1H pair. With a few exceptions, the correlation peaks represent each amino acid in the protein sequence and are used to map the binding pocket of the protein. However, for unambiguous characterization of the binding pocket, assignment of the backbone is necessary [96].Perturbation of chemical shifts occurs under three general conditions: fast, slow and intermediate exchange rates. Fast exchange indicates that the off-rate (k\noff) for protein\u2013ligand interaction is much greater than the frequency difference (chemical shift difference) in Hz between the bound and free states of a given peak. This condition is often seen for weakly binding ligands, with binding constants (K\nD) in the high \u03bcM to mM range [96]. In a titration with increasing ligand amount, peaks in the HSQC spectrum are observed to gradually shift from their original position toward the chemical shift characteristic of the bound state. In fast exchange conditions, the observed chemical shift is a weighted average of the shifts in the free and bound states [104]. K\nD may be determined by a fitting procedure. Slow exchange occurs when the off-rate is much less than the chemical shift difference between these two states, a condition that is often satisfied for ligands that bind with sub-micromolar affinity. In this condition, two separate signals for the bound and free states of a given peak are observed . Intermediate exchange is observed when the off-rate is comparable to the chemical shift difference and is characterized by peak broadening together with chemical shift changes [96, 104].The CSP method is useful in screening potential ligands for novel proteins. Testing multiple ligands and mapping their interactions with the protein can help shed light on proteins with unknown function. In particular, predicted macrodomains have characteristic functions that can aid in their classification , such as ADP-ribose recognition. Furthermore, CSP aids in the analysis of protein\u2013ligand binding affinity and offers structural information characteristic of a protein\u2013ligand interface.\n",

            "text": "CD spectroscopy is a useful technique in determining the secondary structure of a protein. Common features of \u03b1-helix (minima at 222 nm and 208 nm; maximum at 190 nm), \u03b2-sheet, (minimum at 218 nm; maximum at 196 nm), and random coil (minimum at 195 nm; maximum at 212 nm) can be seen from the CD spectra. The spectra can be deconvoluted to determine the global secondary structure content of a protein, using various methods and software (recently reviewed by N.J. Greenfield [106]). The assumption used by all methods is that the observed spectrum is a linear combination of the spectra of its secondary structural components plus a noise contribution from aromatic groups and prosthetic groups. For example, a CD measurement that has strong minima at 222 nm and 208 nm is expected to have a large fraction of \u03b1-helix structure. This is helpful when verifying the fold type and stability of a protein sample. These analyses are implemented by software such as SELCON3 [107] which takes mean residue ellipticity, or \u03b8MRE, as input. SELCON3 will analyze these data and report the content of each secondary structure in the analyte.",

Use 20 mM Tris for more basic buffers. Use 10 mL of lysis buffer for every gram of cell paste recovered from culture growth.The ZDOCK server will input the first state of PDB files containing multiple states (e.g., NMR ensemble). The manual submission mode will input all states but treat atom positions collectively; hence, it is better to separate states before manual submission (e.g., split_states command in Pymol).The ZDOCK output file is given the extension .out. An explanation of the output file is given on the ZDOCK server website (http://zdock.umassmed.edu/zdock_output_format.php). This file also contains the displacement of the final structures relative to the initial structures and their corresponding ZDOCK scores. To generate all the predicted complexes, the ZDOCK program will need the initial structure files, also in the result link, and this output file to calculate the relative displacement and generate individual PDB files.The Python scripts for converting and preparing proteins in PDB format are provided in the GitHub repository of HADDOCK, where it also explains how HADDOCK deals with additional PDB structural information such as missing density, cofactors, and alternative positions. For DNA/RNA structures in PDB format, the one-letter code (residue name, column 18\u201320 in PDB format) of the PDB file needs to be converted to a three-letter code in the CNS PDB format (see Table 6). This should be easy to accomplish by a search and replace function in Microsoft Word or other text replace scripts.\n\nIf one wishes to dock a DNA/ RNA sequence with no solved structures, the 3D-DART server (3DNA-Driven DNA Analysis and Rebuilding Tool) [108] is provided to generate custom 3D structural models of DNA and RNA with control over the local and global conformation such as nucleic acid type (A-form or B-form), bend-angle, location of the bend-angle, and custom values for base-pair step parameters.\n7.The \u201cactive\u201d residues are those that have been experimentally determined to be involved in the interaction between the two molecules, and also solvent-accessible (either main chain or side chain relative accessibility should be >40\u201350%). This accessibility cutoff is not a hard limit and should be adjusted by the user based on their understanding about the interface. The \u201cpassive\u201d residues are solvent-accessible surface neighbors of active residues.8.All results are saved in structures/it1/analysis and structures/it1/water/ analysis. These statistical and energetic analyses are described in the Analysis part of the online HADDOCK manual.9.The detailed tutorials and user manuals for these preparations are available at Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s website. In the protein preparation, there are three tabs: Import and Process are to perform basic tasks and fix problems from crystal structures such as missing density and bond orders. The Review and Modify tab is to delete unwanted chains (e.g., for multimeric proteins) and water molecules. The Refine command allows the user to perform energy minimization on the structures by changing hydrogen bond orientations and side chain orientations. The automatic restrained refinement is done using an OPLS2005 force field with heavy atoms convergent to a stated RMSD, which by default is 0.3 \u00c5. If the user sets this RMSD to zero, then all the heavy atoms will be fixed during the minimization, with only hydrogens being minimized. In the ligand preparation, the program can take one or a library of 2D chemical molecules and assign hydrogens, ionization properties, stereochemistry and generate tautomers.10.Inoculate near an open flame.11.If necessary, the broth with antibiotic added may be stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The flask should be covered with foil and foil sealed with Parafilm.12.To keep the resuspended culture cool during sonication, transfer resuspended cells to a glass beaker in an ice bath.13.When filtering the lysate in preparation for HPLC chromatography, be careful not to make bubbles which can precipitate protein in the sample. Change syringe filters if it becomes clogged and filtering becomes manually difficult.14.Set the flow path of the \u00c4KTA\u2122 purifier to flow through the column and out the fraction collection valve. This equilibrates all of the flow lines in your system and ensures proper flow and pressure for purification. Load a maximum of 20 times the column volume as we have seen this will overload the binding capacity of the column15.13 mL is the load volume limit for size-exclusion chromatography because a higher sample volume would compromise the separation efficiency\nof the purification step. Particles separate based on their size through the pores of the column. If the sample volume is too large, then the pores can overload and the accessible surface area of the column will decrease. This will prevent smaller particles from taking a longer path through the column and decrease the resolution of the purification. To achieve the best resolution, the sample volume should be 5% of the entire column volume or less.16.If using RNA, handle stock solutions in a dedicated RNA area and pipette set to reduce exposure to nucleases that are often present in laboratories.17.\nProtein concentration is increased by 20% in each sample to provide a reasonable range of concentrations.18.Blank run. Recommended protein concentration: <10 \u03bcM. Recommended salt concentration: <100 \u03bcM.\n",
