Methods: Based on samples from hospitalized patients confirmed to be HAdV positive in Bern, Switzerland, from 1998 to 2017, and on their associated demographic and clinical data, we identified epidemiological trends and risk factors associated with HAdV infection. HAdV genotyping was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the hypervariable hexon gene. The obtained sequences were phylogenetically compared with sequences from international HAdV strains. Results: HAdV was identified in 1302 samples tested. Cases of HAdV infection were reported throughout the years with no clear seasonality. Upper respiratory tract samples, conjunctivitis swabs, and stool had the highest positivity rate (56.2%, 18.7%, and 14.2% of the cases, respectively). HAdV infection was highest among children \u22644 years old. Increased number of HAdV cases were observed in years 2009 (n = 110) and 2010 (n =112). HAdV8 was the predominant genotype among patients older than 20 years, and was mostly associated with ophthalmic infection. Predominant genotypes among children \u22644 years old were HAdV1, HAdV2, and HAdV3, which were mostly associated with respiratory tract infections.

Although HAdV infections are known to fluctuate over time, increased cases of HAdV infections were evidenced among young children every 4 years. This study is the first to report such recurring pattern. Previously, Heo and colleagues 23 showed that cases of HAdV respiratory infection are common during winter and spring. A study by Yao and colleagues concluded that HAdV prevalence may be related to age and season. 24 Our findings suggest that increased HAdV infection in Switzerland was related to age, but to a lesser extent to a particular season, as HAdV infections occurred throughout the year. Also when detected, HAdV was predominantly found among those aged \u22644 years. HAdV is therefore confirmed to be an important pathogen in clinical practice, mainly in the paediatric population. The high incidence of HAdV8 associated with ophthalmic infections among young adults, middle-aged and elderly in the years 2009 and 2010 is consistent with what was seen in Germany for instance. 25 Our finding is also consistent with other studies that showed HAdV8 to be a major culprit of adenovirus-associated conjunctivitis. 9, 26, 27 In addition, the predominance of HAdV species C genotypes, particularly HAdV1 and HAdV2, found among young children is also supported by other studies. 28 As young children have developing immune system, they may be more prone to infections. In the same line of evidence, most HAdV infections in immunocompromised hosts are known to be associated with HAdV species C genotypes 1 and 2. 14,29 Our study focused on molecular typing of HAdV positive samples collected between 1998 and 2017 among young children \u22644 years in order to identify the genotypes associated with an increase of cases of HAdV infection among this age category every 4 years. Various genotypes were identified to be causing HAdV infections, among which HAdV1 and HAdV2 genotypes were predominantly detected in the years with reoccurring peaks.

In our study, we noticed that, besides these genotypes, other HAdV genotypes were identified in those presenting with gastrointestinal infection ( Figure 5B ), a finding that is similar to what was reported by Kumthip and colleagues. 39 In addition, it is known that specific HAdV species have distinct tissue tropism which may determine the clinical presentation. 40 The presence of HAdV in respiratory tract and stool samples from patients not presenting with any clinical symptoms might be detected incidentally, thus making interpretation of the clinical significance of a positive result difficult.

Although the data showed no clear seasonality, a pattern reminiscent of HAdV outbreaks was observed particularly in January 2010 (n = 24), July 2009 (n = 33), and March 1998 (n = 24). The mean expected incidence of HAdV cases per month from 1998 to 2017 was 5.43 cases (95% CI, 1.86-12.26 cases). Therefore, HAdV incidence of \u226513 cases was defined as significantly higher number than the mean expected incidence (Figure 1B). Upper respiratory tract samples were the most common positive sample types (N = 731; 56.2%), followed by conjunctivitis swab (243; 18.7%), and stool (184; 14.1%). HAdV was least detected from EDTA blood and genital swab samples. Higher numbers of positive conjunctivitis swab samples were observed in years 2009 and 2010 than in any other year (Figure 2A). Among young children, upper respiratory tract and stool samples were associated with the largest number of positive cases, whilst conjunctivitis swab samples were the most positive among young adults, middle aged and elderly (Figure 2B). A peak in HAdV cases was also observed between the years 2009 and 2010, as compared to other years in the study period, across all age categories.
