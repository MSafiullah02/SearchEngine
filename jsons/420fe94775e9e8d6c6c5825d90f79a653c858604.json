However, these cells are extremely reactive to any type of injury and frequently undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia to produce a much thicker mesothelial cell layer with a significantly increased number of mesothelial cells ( Fig. 30 .2). The layers of parietal pleura are not as distinct as in the visceral pleura. The landmark that may be used to identify the parietal pleura is the fatty tissue between the skeletal muscle of the chest wall and the connectiveelastic tissue of the parietal pleura (see Fig. 2 .35B in Chapter 2).",

            "text": "The surface mesothelial layer is best appreciated by scanning electron microscopy, which shows the numerous microvilli that arise from mesothelial cells and project into the pleural space ( Fig. 30.3 ).2 In normal conditions, the microvilli measure about O.ll1m in diameter and up to about 311m in length. When the pleura is injured and there is hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mesothelial cells, the number and length of the microvilli increase. The exact function of the microvilli is not entirely understood. At one time it was thought that they increased the absorptive surface of the visceral pleura, but later studies showed that the visceral pleura did not absorb pleural fluid to any significant degree. 3 Current thought is that microvilli serve as an increased surface area to release hyaluronic acid, which serves as a lubricant between the visceral and parietal layers of the pleura during movement of the lung in respiration. 3 The density of the microvilli is greater on the visceral mesothelial cells than on the parietal mesothelial cells. The mesothelial cytoplasm is rich in pinocytotic vesicles, mitochondria, and other organelles, as well as prekeratin fibrils (Fig. 30.4) . The visceral and parietal pleura have an extensive lymphatic network, although in the normal resting state, these lymphatic channels are inconspicuous. Openings between the mesothelial cells, \"called stomata,\" occur on the parietal surface and range between 2 and 1211m in diameter ( Fig. 30 .5).4-6 These stomata communicate directly with lymphatic lacunae. The stomata are thought to represent exit points for pleural fluid, protein, and cells that come from the pleural spaceY Pleural Fluid Formation Pleural fluid formation has been discussed in detail by Sahn 3 , 8 and Pistolesi et a1. 9 Most of the pleural fluid is produced by the parietal pleura, and there is a dynamic interaction between production and resorption. As described by Sahn/ six mechanisms have been postulated for the accumulation of abnormal volumes of pleural fluid: (1) increase in hydrostatic pressure in the microvascular circulation, (2) decrease in oncotic pressure in the microvascular circulation, (3) decrease in pressure in the pleural space, (4) increased permeability of the microvascular circulation, (5) impaired lymphatic drainage from the pleural space, and (6) movement of fluid from the peritoneal space.",

What type of biopsy, if any, depends on the clinical situation and the information needed. Open pleural biopsy is the standard against which closed pleural biopsy and thoracoscopic pleural biopsy are compared. As one might expect, open pleural biopsies have a higher diagnostic yield than closed pleural biopsies or thoracoscopic pleural biopsies. As discussed later, in my opinion thoracoscopic pleural biopsies are often adequate for diagnosing nonneoplastic and neoplastic conditions. As long as an adequate tissue S.P Hammar sample containing diagnostic material is obtained that can be studied by a variety of methods, a fairly accurate diagnosis is possible in most cases.",

It is important for the pathologist to communicate with the pulmonologist or surgeon who is performing the biopsy in order to gain insight into the reason for doing the biopsy. For example, if the patient is thought to have an infectious pleuritis, a portion of the biopsy should be sent for culture. If the clinical diagnosis is cancer, then a portion of the specimen should be sent for cytologic evaluation, including potential evaluation by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (see Chapter 43 on pleural neoplasms). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens usually provide a small amount of tissue, which can provide a great deal of information if appropriately handledY-21 Most fine-needle aspiration biopsies are performed on masses thought to represent neoplasms. Small pieces of tissue obtained from such biopsies can be directly processed for electron microscopic examination or prepared as a cell block on which immunohistochemical analyses can be done.

Antony described the importance of mesothelial cells in maintaining homeostatic balance and the changes that occurred in mesothelial cells and other cells in infectious and neoplastic pleural disease. Pleural fluid cytokines observed in infectious disease and malignant disease are shown in Table 30 Pleural disease, in general, is associated with an infiltration of a number of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells in various proportions depending on the course and etiology of the underlying disease. 23 Mesothelial cells have been demonstrated to actively participate in pleural inflammation via release of various mediators and proteins, including platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic peptide, nitric oxide, collagen, antioxidant enzymes, and plasminogen activation inhibitor. As discussed by Kroegel and Antony,23 several inflammatory mediators have been detected in increased concentrations within pleural fluid, including lipid mediators, cytokines, and proteins such as adenosine deaminase,lysozyme, eosinophil-derived cationic proteins, and products of the coagulation cascade. The presence of these mediators underlies the concept of pleural inflammation, and certain cytokines seem to be characteristic of specific etiologies of pleuritis (Table 30 The authors concluded the diagnostic separation of pleural effusions could be done cost-effectively by utilizing pleural fluid absolute lactic dehydrogenase (FLDH) and total protein (TPR) alone with the elimination of serum LDH.",

The authors reported there were sufficient data available to calculate multilevel likelihood ratios for the elements of Light's criteria, pleural fluid protein, ratio of pleural fluid to serum cholesterol, pleural fluid cholesterol, and gradient of pleural fluid to serum albumin. Each test provided levels of likelihood ratios through the most clinically relevant range (0 to 10). The authors published the use of likelihood ratios to categorize a pleural effusion (Table 30 .5) and concluded that multilevel likelihood ratios combined with the clinician's estimation of the pretest probability of an exudative effusion improved the diagnostic accuracy of discriminating between exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

The authors concluded that in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusions, higher CRP levels could prove to be a rapid, practical, and accurate method of differentiating parapneumonic effusion from other exudative-type effusions and could be helpful in discriminating exudative from transudative effusions. Chierakul et al. 30 published a study to determine the validity of pleural fluid CRP concentrations or pleural fluid to serum CRP ratio for differentiating tuberculous pleuritis from malignant pleural effusion in patients presenting with lymphocytic exudative pleural effusions. The authors found the pleural fluid and serum CRP levels were significantly higher in the tuberculous pleuritis group than in the malignant pleural effusion group, and concluded that in patients presenting with lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion, a simple marker of raised pleural fluid CRP could be helpful in discriminating between tuberculous pleuritis and malignant pleural effusion (see Chapter 9) .

The causes of these pleural effusions were reported to have been determined by well-established clinical criteria. The authors evaluated chest radiographs from 766 patients during the study. Large effusions were identified in 70 patients (9%) and massive pleural effusions were identified in 93 patients 30 . Nonneoplastic Pleural Disease (12 %) . A similar etiologic spectrum was observed in patients with either large or massive pleural effusions. The most frequent cause of large/massive pleural effusions was malignancy (89 patients; 55%), followed by complicated para pneumonic effusion or empyema (36 patients; 22%), and tuberculosis (19 patients; 12%). The authors found that in patients with large or massive pleural effusions those with malignant effusions were more likely to have higher pleural fluid red blood cell counts and lower adenosine deaminase levels, which were the two parameters that were selected by the logisticregression model as being independent predictors of malignancy. The authors concluded that the presence of large or massive pleural effusion enabled the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis of pleurisy since most effusions were secondary to malignancy or infection, either bacterial or mycobacterial. Bloody pleural fluid with a low adenosine deaminase level favored a malignant condition.",

They reviewed the mechanisms that potentially lead to pleural effusions, reporting that they were caused by air or blood or both in the pleural space, infections or other inflammatory diseases, malignancy, pulmonary emboli, asbestos exposure, and drug reactions.

Pleural inflammation, increased vascularity, and mild fibrosis are often associated with an underlying pneumonia or pulmonary infarct ( Fig. 30.6 ). Following a pulmonary infarct, there may be a relatively well-localized area of pleural reaction characterized by an increased vascularity, inflammation, and a layer of fibrin on the outer surface of the visceral pleura ( Fig. 30.7) . Mesothelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia ( Fig. 30 .8) are asso-ciated with numerous conditions that involve the lung parenchyma, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis, and peripheral lung cancers, when pulmonary involvement is close to the pleural surface. Yokoi and Mark 59 reported seven cases of primary carcinoma of the lung close to the pleural surface that were associated with atypical mesothelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In my experience, not only is hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial surface mesothelial cells a frequent finding in this setting, but often a proliferation of multipotential subserosal spindle cells may be seen as well. 60 By immunohistochemistry, these subserosal cells express keratin, vimentin, and muscle-specific actin, and by elec-FIGUR E 30.7. A. Pleura overlying pulmonary infarct shows nonspecific increased vascularity, inflammation, fibrosis, and fibrin on outer surface, change referred to as fibrinous pleuritis. B. Organizing fibrinous exudate. Another nonspecific feature is fibrous thickening of the visceral pleura, usually associated with varying degrees of inflammation, which can be seen in a wide variety of pleural injuries of known cause or in idiopathic pleural fibrosis ( Fig. 30.9 ).61 Reactive eosinophilic pleuritis, a condition that may be confused with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma, is an inflammatory process described in 1977 by Askin et a1. 62 In their report, it was seen primarily in persons who had spontaneous pneumothoracesspecifically, in 22 of 57 cases. None of the patients had clinical or radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease, and a follow-up of 20 patients from 6 months to 5 years showed no evidence of other conditions. Their paper distinguished reactive eosinophilic pleuritis from pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma (pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis; see Chapter 16) because the macrophages associated with the eosinophils often had convoluted nuclei and mimicked the appearance of Langerhans' cells. In my experience reactive eosinophilic pleuritis may be seen in all types of conditions as it is a relatively common, nonspecific reaction to injury (see Figs. 16.48 and 16.49 in Chapter 16) . For reasons discussed previously, eosinophils are common inflammatory cells in pleural disease and are seen in a variety of conditions.",

They pointed out that even after a complete workup, including thoracoscopic biopsies, a significant number of patients with pleural exudates were diagnosed with nonspecific pleuritis, and the natural evolution of these patients was poorly understood. The objective of their study was to determine the natural evolution of patients with nonspecific pleuritis diagnosed after thoracoscopy and to evaluate whether the histologic diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis corresponded with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic pleuritis. The authors studied the evolution of pleuritis in 75 patients (49 men and 26 women) who underwent diagnostic thoracoscopy for evaluation of an unexplained exudative pleural effusion and in whom the histologic diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis was made. Follow-up data were obtained through medical files or telephone contacts with the patients' family doctors; 8.3% of the 75 patients eventually developed a malignancy during the 1150 follow-up period, and in the remaining 91.7% the clinical evolution followed a benign course. A probable cause was established on clinical grounds in 40 patients. True idiopathic pleuritis was observed in 25 patients with a histologic diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis. The authors found recurrence of the effusion in 10 out of 60 (16.7%) patients after a mean period of 26.2 months. The authors concluded the majority of patients with nonspecific pleuritis followed a benign course with a spontaneous resolution of the effusion in 81.8% of cases. In the majority of patients, a probable cause of pleuritis was identified, and idiopathic benign pleuritis occurred in only a minority (25%) of patients. ",

Morphologically, they usually measure no more than 5 mm in thickness and have a sharply marginated, smooth, or undulating lower surface. The prevalence increases with age, being identified in 6% of patients younger than 45 years and in 16% of patients older than 45 years. 64 , 65 The prevalence is similar in men and women. 64 Pathologically, apical pleural cap lesions consist of the combination of pleural and pulmonary parenchymal fibrous tissue, the latter usually having high concentrations of grayish elastin in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections or blackish-gray color in Movat pentachrome-stained sections (Fig. 30.10 ). Occasional areas of calcification and ossification are seen in apical cap lesions. The pathogenesis of the fibrosis is uncertain. In one autopsy study, histologic evidence of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary artery narrowing were identified, and the investigators suggested that intermittent or continuing low-grade infection combined with relative apical ischemia might be responsible for the fibrosis. 66 Apical cap lesions have been reported to be more common in patients who have upper lobe fibrosis secondary to tuberculosis. 67 Yousem 68 reported on 13 cases of apical cap lesions resected for exclusion of a diagnosis of lung cancer. In this study lesions occurred in older individuals, particularly in the apices of the upper lobes, and by radiographic examination appeared as spiculated masses ranging from 1151 0.7 to 5.2cm in diameter. Microscopically, subpleural scars were pyramidal-shaped with overlying pleural adhesions and hyaline-type pleural plaques. They were composed of dense pulmonary fibrous tissue with old, mature collagen and an underlying elastic skeleton contracted in an accordion-like fashion with reduplicated curls of elastic fibers. Scar emphysema was observed at the periphery of the fibrous nodules. Yousem urged that pulmonary apical caps should be recognized for their unique histology because their appearance in the surgical pathology laboratory would likely increase in incidence with the evolution of more sensitive pulmonary radiographic studies. A chronic ischemic etiology was favored.",

The normal volume of pleural fluid in a 70-kg adult varies between 3 and 7 mL, with a predominance of lymphocytes, macrophages, and mesothelial cells. The authors reported that the pleura is functionally a dynamic layer that covers the chest wall and lung and is composed of a monolayer of mesothelial cells on the surface of the pleura. The authors stated that the pleural mesothelium, which was originally considered to be a simple membrane, has emerged as a dynamic cellular organ with multiple key functions, including its ability to phagocytose structures such as asbestos fibers, bacteria, and other particulate matter. The pleural mesothelial cells also release nitrous oxide, which has a number of effects on bacterial and mycobacterial organisms and has been implicated in their demise. In addition, the pleural mesothelial cells are stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1~, interferon-y, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that can produce large amounts of nitrous oxide. The release of oxidant intermediates by mesothelial cells is thought to playa role in killing bacteria. The authors conceptualized the participation of the mesothelial cell as having a primary and secondary response in the pathogenesis of parapneumonic effusions and empyema. This is shown in Figure 30 .12.",

Soubani et al. 82 evaluated the spectrum of conditions associated with pleural effusions in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Evaluation of thoracentesis fluid from 24 men and six women showed an infectious cause in 21 (70%) cases and a noninfectious cause in nine (30%) cases. Bacterial pneumonia was the most common cause of pleural effusion (57%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were the major organisms recovered. Mycobacterial infections were identified in three patients and Nocardia species in one patient. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the leading noninfectious cause of pleural effusion, followed by Kaposi's sarcoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung. The authors concluded that pleural effusion was an important problem in patients with advanced HIV infections and was most commonly associated with bacterial pneumonia.",

Pleural effusions are nutritionally rich culture media in which white blood cell defenses are severely impaired. This may be due to the fact that effective phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophils requires a structure upon which white blood cells can move and ingest bacteria prior to the development of specific antibodies. Bacteria in pleural fluid enlist a complex series of host defense responses that are incompletely understood, despite significant recent advancements in our knowledge. Empyema fluid is relatively deficient in opsonins and complement, and becomes progressively more acidic, hypoxic, and depleted of glucose as infection proceeds. During the inflammatory process, leukocytes release certain substances such as bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins, defensins, lysozyme, cationic proteins, lactoferrin, and zincbinding proteins. Bacteria within empyemas are relatively unresponsive to antibiotics and may release ~-lactamase enzymes capable of degrading ~-lactamase-susceptible ~-lactam antibiotics. The conditions and causes that contribute to bacterial empyema are shown in Table  30 .14.",

            "text": "A definitive diagnosis of chylothorax is made by laboratory analysis of pleural fluid. The presence of chylomicrons on lipoprotein electrophoresis is confirmatory. Staats et al. 109 performed a study in which triglyceride values were determined for 142 effusions defined as chylous or nonchylous by the gold standard test of lipoprotein electrophoresis. Using the Gaussian distribution method, it was estimated that fluid with a triglyceride value of more than 110 mg/dL had less than a 1 % chance of not being chylous, and fluid with a triglyceride value of less than 50mg/dL had no more than a 5% chance of being chylous. Chylothorax rarely occurs as a complication of coronary artery bypass surgery as a result of injury to the left internal mammary lymphatics during dissection of the vessel or from injury to the parasternal nodesYo Tuberculosis is also an unusual cause of chylothorax. ll1 Another rare condition in which chylothorax may occur is lymphangioleiomyomatosis. ll2 The mechanism of chylothorax in lymphangioleiomyomatosis includes (1) chyle leak secondary to proximal lymphatic obstruction or direct involvement of the thoracic duct or its tributaries, (2) general oozing from pleural lymphatics or collateral vessels, and (3) trans diaphragmatic flow of chylous ascites (see Chapter 39). Pneumothorax Pneumothorax refers to air or gas in pleural cavities and may be spontaneous, traumatic, or therapeutic. Spontaneous pneumothoraces are caused by abnormalities of the parenchyma that allow the escape of air into the pleural cavity. These may be caused by blebs and bullae associated with emphysema, by an abscess cavity that communicates with the pleural space, or occasionally by asthma, which results in areas of overexpansion of the lung paren-1167 chyma that then ruptures. Therapeutic pneumothorax was once commonly used to treat tuberculosis. Pneumothoraces occasionally occur during fine-needle aspiration biopsy attempts, and when inserting various catheters into the subclavian vein. Primary spontaneous idiopathic pneumothorax characteristically affects young persons (predominantly young males of asthenic body habitus), is associated with cigarette smoking, and in most cases is due to ruptured apical blebs and bullae. 113 . 114 Recurrent attacks are frequent and disabling, and often require surgical intervention to \"roughen\" the pleural surface with the hope of causing scarring and preventing further air leaks. Histologically, resected apical lung tissue in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax shows, in addition to pleural chronic inflammation and reactive eosinophilic pleuritis, parenchymal changes of band-like subpleural fibrosis, blebs, and paracicatricial emphysema. 113 \u2022 115 Increased pigment-laden macrophages in distal air spaces are consistent with a cigarette smoking history. Parenchymal blood vessels in the vicinity of the pleura may exhibit medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis, but these changes should not be interpreted as indicative of pulmonary hypertension. 116 Rarely, eosinophils may infiltrate the underlying lung parenchyma and prominently infiltrate blood vessels, mimicking the changes in Churg-Strauss syndrome or Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (Fig. 30.20 ) (see also Chapters 16 and 29) . 117 Air leak in the absence of trauma or iatrogenic causes within the pleural cavity is referred to as spontaneous pneumothorax and can be either primary, in which there is no obvious clinical or radiographic evidence of significant pulmonary disease, or secondary, in which a disease is present. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by rupture of air-containing spaces in the visceral pleura or immediately below the visceral pleura. The most common causes are bullae, which are defined as sharply FIGURE 30.20 . Eosinophilic vascular infiltration in spontaneous pneumothorax. A muscular pulmonary artery is densely infiltrated by eosinophils. demarcated regions of emphysema greater than 1 cm in diameter. 1l3 A bleb is defined as a gas-containing space situated entirely within the pleura (see Chapter 24 on emphysema). It is thought that most air-containing spaces associated with pneumothorax are bullae. Computed tomography scans demonstrate areas of emphysema in more than 80% of patients who have spontaneous pneumothorax, even in lifelong nonsmokers. 118 ,119 Spontaneous pneumothoraces are multifactorial in causation. 120 The common causes are listed in Table 30 .20. Iatrogenic causes of pneumothorax are listed in Table 30 Butnor and Guinee 121 recently reported on the pathologic features of the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, a rare inherited genodermatosis characterized by distinct cutaneous lesions with an increased risk of renal and colonic cancer and the development of pleuropulmonary blebs and cysts. Histologically, the lung shows basilar cysts composed of intra parenchymal collections of air surrounded by normal parenchymal or thin fibrous walls, and blebs consisting of collections of air within the pleura. The authors point out that these histologic findings are nonspecific, although their predominantly basilar location contrasts with the apical distribution of well-recognized causes of spontaneous pneumothorax, such as emphysematous bullae and idiopathic blebs. As suggested by the authors, it is important for pathologists to be aware of this rare cause of spontaneous pneumothorax because Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome can radiographically simulate other causes of pulmonary cysts, and the lung and pleura may be the initial site of involvement of this condition.",

In contrast, exudative pleural effusions have higher protein concentrations and usually numerous cells.
