Methods: This cross-sectional correlational study of 769 urban minority adolescents, undertaken between 1999-2002, used three multi-item additive scales: exposure to community violence (18 items; \u03b1 = .89); level of psychological distress (25 items; \u03b1 = 95); presence of URI symptoms (10 items; \u03b1 = .83).

At ECI's inception in 1998, the importance of early childhood had just burst into public awareness with new force and vigor, propelled largely by neuroscience research demonstrating that experience during the first years of life actually physically structures and shapes children's brains. At the same time, social science research documenting the influence of \"neighborhood effects\" on childhood outcomes had recently burgeoned, providing empirical support for an ecological theory of human development which views the larger networks surrounding children as a key determinant in their developmental trajectory. Data linking poor neighborhoods with lower IQ, and higher rates of delinquency, child abuse and infant mortality, solidly illustrated the influence of urban environments on young children's short-and long-term health. Yonkers' own recent battles over school and housing desegregation, and its on-going struggle to differentiate itself from the wealthy county to which it belongs so as to more effectively build on strengths and address needs, created fertile ground for launching ECI.",

It is founded on the premise that building a comprehensive community partnership is a sound strategy for improving health and developmental outcomes. Leadership for ECI has been consistently supplied by the Andrus Children's Center, a community-based organization serving children and families. Start-up funding was secured from the Surdna Foundation, and the initial process of mobilizing community leadership for ECI was facilitated by the simultaneous coalescence of a \"Healthy Yonkers Initiative\" in the city. ECI's first task was to develop the following joint vision statement: Children in Yonkers will be born healthy and, be supported by their families and communities so that they maintain good health, enter school ready to learn, and achieve their developmental potential.",

(3) Produced the Welcome to Yonkers, Dear Baby! book, a resource manual for new parents disseminated at birth with infant thermometers. (4) Since 1999, organized an annual, award-winning Family Day, a fun-filled event that connects over 2,000 families to resources and services; 5) Secured more than $1,000,000 in funding for the ECI itself, and was instrumental in obtaining more than $3,000,000 in new service dollars for Yonkers. Aside from these specific results, a recent evaluation of ECI documents success at increasing community pride and improving cross-sector communication. For example, agencies that once competed for funding now work together on grant applications. The results are programs delivering better comprehensive services to a more extensive base of children and families in Yonkers. Furthermore, the ECI has brought community residents to the table to actively engage in all aspects of ECI's work, successfully bridging a critical gap between policy makers and residents. ECI is a replicable urban health strategy for effectively improving health and developmental outcomes.",

Often this is attributed to the prevalence of specific risk factors in those communities. It is just as important, however, to look at ways in which community factors might encourage health. Identifying and building on existing community resilience can temper financial, racial, and ethnic health disparities. Resilience is the ability to thrive despite risk factors, and studies show that resilience factors can counteract the negative impact of risk factors. The building blocks of healthy communities include safe parks, effective education, available healthy foods, community gathering places, health and social services, and locally owned businesses. For instance, social cohesion corresponds with significant increases in physical and mental health, academic achievement, and local economic development, as well as lower rates of homicide, suicide, and alcohol abuse. Through synthesis of existing research that linked socioenvironmental factors to Healthy People 2010 Leading Indicators, Prevention Institute with funding from the Federal Office of Minority Health, US Department of Health and Human Services developed a community resilience assessment tool called THRIVE (Tool for Health and Resilience In Vulnerable Environments). The tool includes twenty factors and four clusters; built environment, social capital, services and institutions, and macro factors. The tool is being piloted in three communities. This presentation will present elements of the tool and how the approach can support community health, as well as how it is being implemented and supporting work of the East Harlem pilot site in New York City.",

He suggested that geomedicine be divided into subgroups. (Lag 1990) . The term \"geomedicine,\" first used by Zeiss in 1931 as synonymous with geographical medicine, is included in geographical and mapping techniques used to illustrate medical research conclusions. He placed medical geography within the discipline of geography. Zeiss encouraged collaboration between medical field researches including physicians, veterinarians, plant pathologists, entomologist with geographers, meteorologists, soil scientists, and geologists (Zeiss 1931) . For twenty years following Zeiss's paper, geomedical research limited to human medical health, was conducted only at the Heidelberg Scientific Academy (Lag 1990) . Today, health problems have burgeoned with increased pollution from: pharmaceuticals, air conditioning, and fossil fuels, etc. Research now includes environmental and medical effects from dental materials, radiation from cell phones, military weapons, electrical power lines, household wiring, microwave ovens, radioactive waste, etc. and engineers, dentists, veterinarians, geohydrologists, meteorologists, and so on. Dual study terms, e.g. geochemistry, geophysics, geostatistics, geochronology, geoengineering, etc. have long been accepted in the field of geology. I therefore propose, in recognition of revived interest in this topic, that geomedicine become Background: Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyles remain a major challenge to the health of urban populations. Some public health researchers and practitioners have indicated the potential role that recreational trails may play in promoting physical activity in this subgroup. A limited body of previous empirical research has suggested that residents living along recreational trails generally perceive the presence of trails as beneficial to the value of their property. However the public health or safety issues directly linked to the trails have not been systematically studied. Past findings contrast somewhat with occasional anecdotal reports of concerned citizens who voice opposition to future trail development. Since the existing body of evidence is becoming dated, we sought to develop a more extensive body of evidence documenting the experiences of residents who actually live adjacent to urban and suburban trails.",

East Harlem, a predominantly minority community, has the highest prevalence of obesity of any neighborhood in New York City. East Harlem community leaders, who advise the Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center, including members of the East Harlem Community Health Committee, Boriken Neighborhood Health Center and Settlement Health, have recommended that childhood obesity in East Harlem become a major Center priority. Environmental factors are increasingly acknowledged to influence development of overweight and obesity. Leaders in East Harlem have identified a series of environmental factors unique to the urban built environment that appear to be barriers to healthy lifestyles and promoters of childhood obesity. These include: paucity of playspaces, concerns about safety, lack of fresh foods and limited opportunities for youth activities. To assess and characterize these factors, this proposed Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) project will study structural features of the urban built environment of East Harlem with particular attention to: (1) accessibility of parks and recreational areas (2) opportunities and spaces for physical activity (3) safety (4) neighborhood aesthetics and (5) accessibility to healthy foods. We plan additionally in East Harlem to examine children's exposures to contemporary-use synthetic endocrine disruptors (EDs), chemicals that may alter endocrine function, in the built environment-phthalates and bisphenol A-as well as phytoestrogens. Recent national surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that residues of EDs are present almost universally in Americans, but that there exist significant disparities in body burdens by age, sex, race and ethnicity with highest levels found in children and in minorities. Sources of ED exposure appear to include diet, personal care products and plastics. We plan to assess children's biological levels and environmental sources of ED exposure in the urban built environment of East Harlem, New York.

Nonprofit agencies are collaborating with each other as well with business and government. Sometimes they are encouraged but more recently they are demanded or artificially forced into existence. Funding is increasingly contingent on coming to the table with your \"partners.\" As a result, countless complicated relationships are created. Much time and potential are lost because of the lack of a firm conceptual foundation upon which to negotiate and build these partnership arrangements. Along with this trend toward partnering is the underlying assumption that partnering will contribute to providing seamless service delivery and operational efficiency, will ease fund development and demonstrate fiscal responsibility and lead to a reduction of program duplication. Do we really know what we are doing? Do partnerships really improve service delivery and lead to more efficient operation and better outcomes of children and family in urban centers? As part of a two-year federally funded study of partnership-making activity in children's services in Calgary Canada, this paper presents the findings to date that contribute to making sense of partnerships in the delivery of children's services in an urban setting.

Together with its affiliated hospitals and clinics UMB, which has been located in downtown Baltimore for nearly 200 years, is the second largest employer in Baltimore City. Nine years ago the university partnered with the city in Empower Baltimore, a $100 million project funded by HUD to improve social and economic conditions in seven edge neighborhoods around the City, four of which border the UMB campus, and all of which suffer from high rates of poverty, crime, disease, illiteracy, substandard and/or abandoned housing and unemployment. The university's role in this partnership has been coordinated via the Community-University Partnership Council, (COPC) separately funded by HUD and based in the Office of the President of UMB. Through COPC's auspices, and in response to jointly identified needs and opportunities, UMB is currently providing extensive health-related, legal, social and community organizational assistance in a wide variety of areas, including, for example, training community health workers to meet basic needs of residents suffering from diabetes and cardiovascular disease, identifying housing exploitation issues and training and supporting residents in dealing with these, and setting up and running a charter high school. Empower Baltimore funding will end in about 18 months, and budget challenges facing federal, state and local government, the university system and NGOs are raising questions about the mediumand long-term sustainability of COPC. With outside assistance, COPC has embarked on an extensive formative and summative evaluation of its achievements. This evaluation is in process. We would provide an interim report on progress, on what we have learned to date, and on how we anticipate going forward in the changed fiscal and political environment.",

We will develop a best practices model to decrease the spread of HIV and gain understanding of the conditions of vulnerability that include poverty reduction, issues of gender exploitation, and other relevant concerns. This paper will provide information about the project in its current stage. It will include information about recruitment and training of peer educators/researchers, outreach to massage parlors, interviews with women who board ships to provide sex, outreach to the Asian transgender community, and other activities the peer educators/researchers are doing.

Asthma trends disproportionately affect nonwhite children living in urban areas and children living poverty. The overlap between social determinants and environmental factors (e.g., life stress, maternal smoking, indoor aller-gens, and air pollutants) possibly in combination with genetic factors are important to understanding the rising asthma burden in urban communities. This paper will report on the unique partnership between a \"minority\" serving institution, the Center for Community Health Education Research and Service, Inc. (CCHERS) \"and a research\" institution, Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital & Harvard School of Public Health to conduct community-based participatory research on pediatric asthma. The partnership resulted in the creation and formation of the Center on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS), which is one of five centers funded by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to eliminate pediatric asthma disparities. ACCESS includes four research and two training aims implemented through Boston' community health centers. A series of focus groups and surveys with health center providers and families will assess their perceptions about asthma etiology, disparities, and effective treatment strategies. Pregnant women will be recruited to help understand the interaction between the social, physical, environment, and genetic factors considered to influence immune development in early life. We will discuss the development of: the partnership, community relationships, preliminary findings, culturally competent research and training models, and an infrastructure for future research.",

But, when programs they design come to life-when nurses, caseworkers, and outreach staff implement them-a gap emerges. Even the best plans struggle when faced with community realities.

A goal of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing is to prepare nurses ready to meet the challenge of the twenty-first century. The program requires partnerships where students can learn and practice primary prevention and health promotion. A board member for the faith-based services was appointed for the newly opened school. However, they were unable to supply care as they had extremely limited funds. Since the university wanted clinical sites and the church-school needed health care, they formed a partnership to meet both needs in an inexpensive way. Together, they developed goals to provide a healthful school environment, identify and solve health problems, monitor immunization status, provide comprehensive age-appropriate health education, and improve access to primary care, particularly for children with chronic health problems and frequent absences. Nursing students and faculty from several different courses give care at the school, making progress in meeting the initial goals. Prevention strategies that target the entire community to meet new public health challenges like violence, substance abuse, and chronic disease have been implemented.

The collaborators were a local social service agency, a federally qualified health center, and a research center at a nearby university. The goals reflected the interests of the collaborators and included determining the health status of residents in two low-income neighborhoods, increasing utilization of the health center, and increasing the awareness of health and environmental issues among the residents in these neighborhoods. The collaboration exhibited problematic qualities from the very beginning, which carried through the life of the project. These problems included lack of trust among the partners, lack of clear direction in goals and objectives, and absence of leadership. Personnel problems, insufficient institutional capacity, and an incomplete understanding of the communities complicated the implementation of the initiative. Based on an informal process evaluation, previous experience, and a review of literature, we find that there are a number of lessons to be learned. These lessons include: know the target communities, determine the community budget, perform a capacity assessment on all collaborators, have clearly defined and delegated roles, and do not misrepresent or oversell the initiative to the community. While far from a failure, this initiative was not as effective as it could have been in its initial implementation. The experience of this project underscores the need for planning, capacity building, trust building, and a time allowance for a learning curve in community-based outreach initiatives.",

However, these studies have not systematically reviewed the reliability and validity of self-reported measures and few have explicitly linked these to theoretically meaningful constructs that relate neighborhood characteristics to health. The purpose of this study was to estimate the reliability and validity of a questionnaire measuring various self-reported neighborhood characteristics. The study consisted of a face-to-face and telephone interview, administered twice to 48 participants over a two-week period. Interviews lasted less than 15 minutes. Subjects were recruited from a large public hospital setting in New York City serving a largely Latino and African-American population. The questionnaire tested five domains tapping into an underlying construct (aesthetic quality, walking/ exercise environment, safety from crime, access to healthy foods, and social cohesion). Cronbach's alpha ranged from .77 to .88 for scales representing these domains, with test-retest correlations ranging from .89 to .93. Additionally, neighborhood indices of recreational facilities, problems, and social participation were examined, with test-retest measures ranging from .62 to .94. The results from this study suggest that self-reported measures of neighborhood characteristics can be reliably measured. Moreover, this study provides researchers with a validated questionnaire that can aid in developing and testing hypotheses regarding the effect of neighborhood characteristics on the health of urban communities.",

Data were from 1,609 participants enrolled in the SHIELD study (Self-Help in Eliminating Life-Threatening Disease), a network-oriented HIV prevention study. Hierarchical linear models were used to assess the relationship between the clusters' mean and median perceptions of neighborhood disorder and individual depression, controlling for a range of social and demographic variables at the individual level. A geographic clustering procedure produced the highest aggregate reliability coefficient for neighborhood disorder, followed by block groups and census tracts. Neighborhood disorder was strongly related to depression using a hierarchical linear model at the geographic cluster and block group level of analysis, but not at the census tract level. With relatively large samples within a city, geographic clustering may provide neighborhood researchers with an alternative method of data aggregation for assessing \"contextual\" effects.

This has spurred research exploring the relationship between health and environmental housing conditions common in deteriorating housing. Little of this research has been directed towards public housing residents who are among the most at risk for residing in unhealthy housing. Exposures that have been implicated in contributing to asthma exacerbation are cockroach and mouse infestation, dampness and mold, decreased ventilation and environmental tobacco smoke. This study employed a cross-sectional survey to assess the self-reported prevalence of respiratory and allergic diseases and symptoms and environmental conditions in two Boston public housing developments. Factor analysis identified exposures and symptoms that could be reduced into new composite indices. Symptom index scores for groups reporting presence or absence of pest infestation, poor ventilation and moisture and mold exposures were compared. Separate allergy and asthma symptom index scores were elevated for those reporting exposures to tobacco smoke, poor apartment ventilation and mice, P = 0.05. Asthma symptom index scores were elevated among those exposed to mold and moisture in their apartment (P = 0.05. and P < 0.001). Sick building symptom index scores were higher for those exposed to poor ventilation, mold and cockroaches in their apartment and mice in the building, P = 0.05. This study is one of the few that documents the prevalence of asthma and housing exposures for public housing residents in the United States. Summarizing symptoms into indices, instead of looking at individual symptoms, improved the ability to detect physical determinants that can negatively impact health. Background: Non participation is a common problem in surveys. Epidemiologists usually compare participants and no participants in demographic and other characteristics available, without considering neighborhood or small-area features. We analyzed participants and no participants in a population based study to determine the magnitude of the dengue epidemic in Belo Horizonte City.",

It is important to have a sound understanding regarding the general population, the at-risk population, and suspected TB cases, as well as full-blown TB cases' knowledge about Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection and disease. This is necessary to effectively target health promotion efforts, health education, control measures, and prevention and treatment efforts throughout the community at large. The focus of this presentation is to describe a comprehensive survey instrument developed and piloted tested to measure TB knowledge in at least six domains, namely: TB transmission, characteristics of the person, signs and symptoms, causes, prevention, treatment, medical diagnosis, adherence, multidrug resistance, and treatment. The aforementioned constructs' domains capture all key areas of tuberculosis infection and disease. The benefits of using this instrument will be explained as well as reliability coefficients obtain from the six constructs areas. Suggestions for refining the instrument will also be discussed. Finally, suggestions for using this research tool to promote urban health will be explored.",

            "text": "Despite thirty years of a political movement championing the greater public visibility and acceptance of queer people, the ethical practice of social research into homosexual behavior in the United States, particularly with regard to HIV/AIDS, is characterized by a degree of confidentiality which many who are the subjects of that research might themselves regard as a relic from an earlier historical period. While it is indeed better to err on the side of caution in disclosing information about \"sensitive populations,\" a social science research, as well as rendering the aims and practices of that research inscrutable to its subjects, seems counterproductive. How do we build sufficient protections for \"sensitive populations\" into our research apparatus without forsaking research on those populations as an enterprise? This paper examines the ethics of research among gay-and bisexual-identified male HIV prevention outreach workers in metropolitan New York. Assuming the reticence of these men to speak to issues of the behavioral sciences frequently does, has the paradoxical effect of highlighting their relatively marginal social position as well as unduly dramatizing the invasive quality of the research being undertaken. To compel our informants to undue discretion when that is not what they choose for themselves seems tome to contribute to a continued stigmatization of homosexual behavior and identity as well as HIVseropositive status by social science research institutions.",

This marked the nascent period of the epidemic. Since 1995, urban areas of the Ukraine and Russia have become the epicenter of the HIV infection. The rate of increase in HIV incidence in these cities has become among the highest in the world. Between 1995 and 2001, the prevalence of HIV among IDU increased from approximately 1.5% to 50% in Odessa and other cities, and increased an additional 30% more six months later. Ukraine and Russia have the greatest prevalence of HIV, with the male-female ratio increasing from 4:1 in the mid-1990s to 2:1 in 2001.",

Little is known about the nutritional health of reproductive-aged women of low socioeconomic status in urban Indian centers. In collaboration with a community organization in Ahmedabad, India, we wanted to compare the nutritional status of women during different stages of the reproductive cycle and then develop public health strategies to target nutritional needs during these stages of reproductive life. We recruited 150 reproductive-aged community members who fell into one of three groups (n = 50): pregnant; lactating; and nonpregnant, nonlactating. Nutritional status was assessed via hemoglobin and anthropometric measurements in addition to oral questionnaires. All three groups did not meet international standards for nutritional health. In addition, there were substantial differences among the groups. The pregnant participants had the lowest hemoglobin (9.3 \u00b1 1.5 g/dL) compared to the lactating (10.4 \u00b1 1.8 g/dL) and nonpregnant, nonlactating (10.8 \u00b1 1.6 g/dL) groups (F(2,147) = 10.86; P < 0.0001). Ninety-two percent of the pregnant participants did not reach first trimester criteria for BMI during the course of their pregnancy (BMI >20). In addition, the majority of nonpregnant, nonlactating (68%) and lactating (52%) participants were underweight (BMI < 18.5). Urban Indian women exhibit a poor nutri-tional status even prior to marriage, pregnancy and lactation, and therefore are at risk of even poorer nutritional health during the childbearing years. We developed nutrition guidelines for women to be encouraged by the community organization, emphasizing nutritional needs prior to periods of increased nutritional demand.",

The charting of a course for perinatal health in Central Harlem aims to broaden awareness of the need for a multidisciplinary framework, specifically, how to identify, plan and improve perinatal health in Central Harlem. Premature birth is defined as the birth of the baby before the 37 completed weeks of gestation, and it is a significant health problem in Central Harlem. A parallel trend has been seen in the increasing rates of low birth weight. The burden of both premature birth and low birth weight falls disproportionately on inhabitants of Central Harlem and are a major cause of black-white disparities in perinatal health. The etiology of premature births is not completely understood. The proposed pathophysiological pathways include: (1) Fetal-maternal distress, (2) Intra-amniotic infection, (3) Decidual hemorrhage, and (4) Uterine distension. Prenatal care is one of the most frequently used primary and prenatal care health services with demonstrated health benefits, yet 11% of women in Central Harlem receive either late or no prenatal care. A number of studies have shown that prenatal care yields beneficial results, including reductions in low birth weight and premature birth rates. In Central Harlem, infants are twice as likely to die before the first birth date as infants in other health districts of Manhattan. The Health People's National objective is to reduce the infant mortality to 4.5 per 1,000 live births among all racial groups. Infant mortality in Central Harlem is 13 per 1,000 live births. The majority of these deaths occur in the first 28 days of life, and about one third occur between 29 days and one year. Prevention strategies must focus on reducing premature births and low birth weight rates in Central Harlem, and elimination of black-white disparities by: (1) Reducing maternal distress-by encouraging greater participation of males in a broader maternal support system, including breast feeding; (2) Elimination of alcohol, smoking and drug use during pregnancy; (3) Improving nutrition/folic acid ingestion; (4) Improving access to comprehensive, culturally competent prenatal care and reproductive health services, and increasing the percentage of women who receive prenatal care in the first trimester; (5) Reducing teenage pregnancy rates; and (6) Establishing linkages with Comprehensive Prenatal-Perinatal Service networks in Central Harlem. Charting a course to improve perinatal health in Central Harlem requires an ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration of Central Harlem-based health workers.",

When comparing, DPT1/OPV1 coverage in urban was lower than rural 89% vs. 93-94% (national 93%), whereas DPT3/OPV3 coverage was the same (70%). Measles coverage, however, was lower in urban areas than in rural areas (59% vs. 64%). The number of fully immunized children was lower in urban areas than in rural areas (52% vs. 54%, with the national rate at 54%). Only 39% of children in urban slums are fully immunized by their first birthday. In urban areas, DPT1-3 drop out ranged from 10.6% to 6.9%, however, the drop out rates are about 21.8%-30.3% from DPT1 to measles vaccine. A large number of invalid doses were provided before the minimum required age or before required interval between the doses. Missed opportunities for different antigens were also high. The high rates of dropouts, invalid doses and missed opportunities reflect the poor quality of services rendered. In addition, male children have more access to immunization than female children. Boys' access to DPT1 was 6% higher than that of the girls. The dropout rate for DPT1 to measles in the boys was higher, however, than that of the girls (29% for boys vs. 20% for girls), revealing lower full immunization coverage for boys for girls. Another finding showed that the mothers' knowledge levels of full immunization were poor. Most of the mothers did not know the number of times their children were required to be fully immunized. Also, mothers' education was found to be related to the immunization status of their children. Uneducated mothers were less likely to get their children fully immunized than those who were educated. It also revealed that certain level of education, such as SSC or higher, increased the mother's role in the decision making process for her child's immunization. Finally, lack of faith in immunization and lack of awareness of the need and importance of immunization were the main reasons for nonimmunization (6% of the total children), which indicate that wrong perceptions about immunization persist in the community. There is also lack of proper information regarding the subsequent dosage. Fear of adverse reaction, sickness of the child, and mother's preoccupation with other work resulted in high dropout rates, which consequently contributed to low full immunization coverage.",

This study used a qualitative approach to describe more fully the experiences of low-income mothers and health care providers with preventive child health care services in an urban environment. The major findings revealed two major themes. The first is organizational structure that acts as barriers that impede the mother's ability too effectively use preventive child health care services. The second is the differential value orientation of mothers and health care providers that lead to conflicts between the two different value systems. These findings are associated with poor patient compliance. The results point to the need for comprehensive, collaborative and accessible health care services in urban communities that will promote accessibility which encourages the mother's use of preventive child health care services in urban communities.

Many cases of these diseases can be prevented with attention to improving eating and activity habits. Efforts to improve these habits through education alone are rarely successful. In addition, it is critical to address community factors such as access to fresh nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities. Shifting community norms toward healthier behaviors requires a comprehensive approach that addresses not only individual knowledge, motivation, and skills, but also ensures the surrounding environment supports healthy behaviors. The Strategic Alliance for Healthy Food and Activity Environments was founded to promote environmental and policy changes to improve eating and activity patterns in California. The goal of the Alliance is to reframe the debate on nutrition and physical activity, from a matter of individual choice and lifestyle to an issue of environment and corporate and government responsibility. The Alliance currently consists of over 250 members. It has identified five arenas for action: Children's Environments, Government, Industry Practices, the Health Care System, and the Media.

Ample evidence shows that physical activity is important for maintaining good health, improving psychological well-being, and preventing premature death. The Latino community is disproportionately affected by diabetes, a disease that is closely related to diet and exercise habits. Studies show that Latinos in general, are more likely to be physically inactive than their white counterparts. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between barriers to physical activity and diabetes in the Latino immigrant community in Washington Heights in New York City. The Health and Physical Activity Questionnaire (HPAQ) is a 49-item questionnaire designed to assess levels of physical activity and the barriers to physical activity participation in the Latino community in a primary care recruited patient. We hypothesize that individual-level social factors (e.g., social support, leisure time, acculturation, literacy, poverty) and neighborhood-level factors (e.g., adequate housing, safe neighborhoods) may be particularly important in the Latino community in Washington Heights and are primary determinants of the burden of diabetes faced by Latinos in NYC. Correlational procedures were employed to investigate the relationship between individual-level social factors, neighborhood level factors, and diabetes/health in general in a group of Latino immigrants. The findings of this study will help understand the impact of urban social and physical environments upon health.

Of these, obesity is of urgent concern because its multiple associations with other illnesses have a detrimental impact on the quality and length of life of different populations, bringing about economic consequences to out society as a whole. A disturbing increase in obesity and \"adult-type\" diabetes is occurring in people of all ages but particularly among young people. In addition, Hispanics, African-Americans, low income individuals and women are disproportionately inactive and at higher-than-average risk for obesity and diabetes. In this paper, a model for integrating natural resources, community lifestyle and health promotion is developed through a phased, multilevel approach including outreach and education, and the formation of women's walking groups in public parks. Our primary goal is to reduce the incidence and complications due to sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Walking in public parkland is available to everyone, it is free, it is \"natural\" and thus may be more appealing and accessible to the aforementioned population groups than gyms and health clubs, which are costly, have limited hours, and seem \"artificial.\" Following principles of the diffusion of innovation theory, walking becomes normative by making it a recreation, a social event, and a transportation means among community members. Walking is both an end in itself, and a gateway to a more active life that engages community members with their physical and social environment. This intervention model establishes a method for engaging populations at risk for obesity and related health problems in physical activity that is both free and fun. By putting physical activity within the reach or a larger population, the pain and suffering, the lost productivity, and the direct and indirect financial costs of obesity-related diseases could be dramatically reduced. In dire economic times, parks' funding is often the first to go because parks are not a life-and-death service. On the contrary, parks could make the difference between life and death for many people and this approach could suggest positive strategies for a broad range of policy and legislative decisions.",

Despite the promulgation of laws intended to effectively combat this scourge, it has remained a major problem that has threatened the confidence of the health care system. Our study was carried out in Ibadan, Oyo state, one of the largest cities in West Africa. The study was done to ascertain the public health implications of counterfeit and substandard drugs. There are 912 physicians currently practicing in the private sector of Ibadan, Oyo state, each of whom responded to a questionnaire intended to ascertain their experiences with counterfeit drugs. Most confirmed that counterfeit drugs were commonly encountered in their practices. Antibiotics were most commonly encountered counterfeit drugs. Two thirds of the drugs were counterfeit and subsequently, substandard drugs had been manufactured in Asia. Indian-made drugs contributed to about half of the counterfeit drugs from Asia. One fifth of the drugs were manufactured in Nigeria and the rest from other parts of the world in negligible quantities. 48% of the respondents had encountered serious health consequences of counterfeit and substandard drugs. 13.4% of encounters were reported to have had fatal outcomes. Strategies adopted to curtail the purchase of counterfeit and substandard drugs resulted in increased cost of medicines. The physicians who responded to our questionnaire perceived that businessmen who dealt in drugs were responsible for drug counterfeiting. In addition, an overwhelming majority felt that the government's response to the problem was inadequate and preferred the solution of greater regulatory control as well as the enforcement of existing laws. The situation in which businessmen and non-professionals have been licensed to deal in pharmaceutical has resulted in massive importation and manufacturing of counterfeiting drugs in Nigeria. Based on results of our survey, it is recommended that strong regulatory control is reinforced, ceasing the import of fake drugs to Nigeria at the source (essentially, within countries of production), increasing public enlightenment campaigns, and beefing up surveillance at all ports of entry, including empowerment of the regulatory bodies (i.e. the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control). In addition, more financial and logistic support would help in reducing negative health impact of counterfeit drugs in Nigeria.",

This study will contribute to the literature on disaster as it pertains to the role of organizations in the recovery process.",

These included: convening a meeting of leaders of youth organizations; circulating alerts through various media; preparing tip-sheets that were widely distributed; and participating in 9/11 planning meetings of small and large groups. Outreach strategies to city government and community-based organizations had the goal of disseminating sensitive and informative messages to a broad audience. The leaders of this effort believe that organizations, such as schools, places of worship, neighborhood and parent associations, have a role in promoting trauma recovery. Many individuals suffering from stress, anxiety and fear related to the attacks on the World Trade Center, have not sought individual counseling, but would be reached with a dose of therapy if organizations held events geared towards wellness and recovery. Surveys of youth in particular have indicated that many have been experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress over this past year. The activities developed by this project were simple to integrate into youth programs, school curricula and family time around the anniversary. After-school programs, community-based youth groups and family-strengthening programs were early adopters of the proposed wellness activities during the month of September 2002. Projects were tailored to the needs and populations of each organization. They created supportive environments for youth to express feelings and reflect creatively on this stressful year. The organizers of this initiative were featured on a local cable network as \"New Yorkers of the Week.\"",

However, mental health recovery has not been evenly distributed across city neighborhoods. This suggests, for instance, that the events of 9/11 may have had quite different psychological effects on residents of the Bronx who live with generally higher rates of background distress but who were, generally, more indirectly affected by the terrorist acts. To address this concern, this project seeks to gain qualitative information from Bronx-based mental health outreach workers about their experience of providing mental health services to local community residents. The aim of this study is to learn about the psychological and emotional concerns of outreach workers serving Bronx communities after 9/11, the stress on these care providers, their perceptions of the influence of cultural factors on psychological response and use of services, and their sense of the efficacy of present outreach strategies in addressing community needs.",

Middle school nurses recognize this is a vulnerable population and realize they can make a positive impression, yet an ill-defined role and time restraints may prevent them from implementing certain programs to benefit the middle school population. Based on our literature review, a health education program was implemented targeting middle school students at risk for obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. A pre-and posttest were given to students measuring knowledge of health consequences associated with type II diabetes mellitus and obesity, proper portion sizes, healthy food choices, and the importance of exercise. The sample included 13 female students from an urban public middle school. Data analysis was conducted comparing pre and posttest results. Results showed an 11 percent increase in knowledge. Continued contact with these students to reinforce information would be beneficial.

During several meetings of the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) Emergency Preparedness Coordinating Council (EPCC) numerous hospital executives voiced concern that some essential employees might not respond during a major weapons of mass destruction (WMD) emergency. While there were no reported hospital staff shortages after the September 11 and anthrax events, these were not considered to be WMD events. Were a true WMD event to occur (i.e. large scale smallpox outbreak or chemical attack with 100,000 victims), it is anticipated that hospitals may experience staffing problems. Similarly, this same concern was also been raised by the New York City Department of Health. During an emergency preparedness pilot training program for School Health Nurses, 50 participants were queried, and 45 reported that they perceived some sort of barrier to reporting to work during a disaster situation.

An intervention project conducted by the Construction Hygiene and Ergonomics Program is described which developed guides to aid construction managers in planning and implementing control programs for lead and silica during urban infrastructure rehabilitation. Both quantitative (exposure assessment, biological monitoring) and qualitative (focus groups, site audits) methods were employed. The role of different groups in enhancing or retarding project completion is analyzed in terms of the viability of intervention research in the construction environment. The groups discussed include the owners, contractors, unions, workers, government agencies and the community. The particular relationship of these groups in an urban environment, where construction projects are often carried out in close proximity to living and public spaces, creates a dynamic interplay of social forces that often has unpredictable consequences for the outcome of research endeavors. In order to test an intervention research hypothesis, the researcher must not only understand the interests which the different groups represent, but become skilled in advocating for the project to different audiences. This lesson is exemplified by comparing and contrasting the results obtained with lead to those of silica. Although both are very toxic to adults, the outcomes for interventions are different, since only lead is a well-documented hazard to children. The project is outlined from the beginning, when researchers attempt to gain site access, to the point when the intervention is fieldtested.",

Gershon R, Qureshi K, Gurtman A, Sepkowitz K, and Morse S There is a small but important body of literature examining the impact of research involving survivors of disasters, underscoring the potential harm to study participants through revisiting the disaster events. Yet, in order to make important policy and procedural changes that may help both current and future disasters victims, such research is vital. The difficulty is how to balance the research with those of the survivors. There is a concern that disaster survivors may need special protections because they may be especially vulnerable to harm related to the research process itself. This issue is of immediate concern to us as one of a several teams of investigators exploring various aspects of the New York City World Trace Center (WTC) disaster. In our case, we are examining the individual and organizational factors that may have served as barriers or facilitators to timely and effective evacuation of the WTC evacuation on 9/11/01. The difficulty of insuring that survivors are not overburdened by multiple requests for participation in numerous studies is an important consideration, as is the logistics of contacting survivors in order to recruit them into the various studies. This is especially difficult with the WTC example since the businesses formerly located in the towers have since relocated throughout the tristate area, and many employees have moved on to other jobs and are no longer employed by the same firms. These and other ethical and logistical considerations of conducting disaster research will be addressed with practical solutions identified that may serve to help other researchers.",

Multidisciplinary services are provided to a cohort of 15 grandmothers and 40 children. Components of the interventions include home visits by community health nurses, an eight-week nurturing program, a reading program, monthly dinners focused on family building and health education, parish nursing, spiritual support, and a grandmothers' urban gardening project. Families are identified by a family services worker at a partnership school, Tench Tilghman Elementary School, in collaboration with the Julie Community Center. Programs are run in a local church, Amazing Grace Lutheran Church, in partnership with the minister, parish nurse, and parishioners. The project is a model program for community-academic partnerships. The need was identified by the community partners who then sought the academic assistance of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing to develop, implement, and evaluate the program.

While they are at-risk individuals, many of the study's participants come from privileged, welleducated, urban families. They have the means to be sent to New York City's most academically prestigious independent preparatory schools, and accordingly, nearly 100% of them are college bound. Despite abundant opportunities to thrive, eating pathologies plague these young women. In efforts to understand the social processes occurring within independent schools that might be contributing to the rising incidences of eating disorders, the present research quantitatively assessed the perceived gender socialization practices of female students attending eleven different single sex and coeducational schools. Through the use of multilevel modeling, results indicated that individual schools embody a distinct and measurable culture regarding female gender role socialization. Numerous significant findings are discussed, among the most interesting being that after controlling for the negative impact (i.e., with respect to eating problems) of dating and appearance concerns among peers-which were reported to a greater degree in coeducational contexts, and the positive impact of peers engaging in nontraditional gender role behaviors-which were reported to a greater degree in all-female contexts, girls attending the single sex schools still tended to report more eating disturbances than their coeducational peers. These counterintuitive results warrant further qualitative investigation of the social dynamics particularly occurring within all-female school environments. The research suggests the need for participatory school-based intervention and prevention programs targeting the adolescent daughters of residents living in upwardly mobile urban communities.",

As a result of the 2001 anthrax attacks, public health has improved its capabilities to understand and respond to threats of deliberately deployed pathogens against populations. Bioterrorism will remain a focus of concern for the next decades of the twenty-first century for both public health and traditional emergency responders. Although their role in the identification and containment of deliberately engendered epidemics is crucial, public health's ability to protect populations will depend on successful efforts to coordinate with the traditional responder community. Conversely, it is important for emergency responders to be educated in the principles of public health practice and epidemiology to reduce and contain disease spread. The community infrastructure supporting an urban environment faces specific challenges of threat mitigation and population protection. High population densities, diversities of languages and cultures, and finite social services would place extreme demands on the responder communities to disseminate risk communication; meter the flow of the truly ill and the worried well to available health services; house, shelter and canteen displaced persons; and so forth. The successful interface of capabilities and skills across the responder sectors (especially public health and traditional emergency management personnel) will have ramifications on the numbers of persons who are exposed and, quite possibly, have direct impact on mortality levels. This session will provide a crosswalk of capabilities, jargon and basic precepts to improve the foundation through which public health and traditional emergency responders can plan and operationalize coordinated response activities.",

Nonadherence to TB treatment is a major obstacle to the control of TB. Treatment behavior is a complicated phenomenon, and successful strategies to enhance patient adherence must address the barriers to treatment encountered by patients. The association between homelessness and TB is widely acknowledged, but few studies have examined how sociocultural factors impact adherence to TB treatment in homeless populations. Also conspicuously absent is any mention of the social conditions that localize TB to the poorest in society. The literature has consistently overlooked that those least likely to adhere to TB treatments are those least able to adhere. This study uses qualitative methods (including participant observation and ethnographic interviewing) to address this knowledge gap. Sixteen (16) homeless individuals in Edmonton were tracked over a period of 18 months. Working from a social ecological framework, the study shows how sociopolitical realities play out in the lives of homeless people-shaping not only their attitudes towards personal health but also their notions of individual agency.",

In this curriculum, first and second year medical students are presented with interactive problem based case studies. Hypertext links provide access to questions, videos and fact sheets that cover the following topics: alcoholism, drug abuse, trauma, infectious disease, cardiology, respirology, gastroenterology, mental health, women's health, youth and international comparisons. The learning objectives are: (1) To identify health problems common to the homeless; (2) To recognize the unique factors in the lives of the homeless that complicate their access to the current health care system; (3) To adapt our health care practices to meet these unique needs; (4) To develop clinical decision-making skills and choose appropriate interventions relevant to the homeless; and (5) To participate in hypothetical hospital discharge planning and long-term management of homeless patients. Students receive audio and visual feedback as they answer questions in the case studies. Recently, HPC has been incorporated into the University of Ottawa's medical school curriculum",

Some of these respond to interventions aimed at achieving urban health. Transposing in a synthetic manner a vast amount of scientific knowledge to populations and decision-makers to influence urban planning can be a challenge.Methods: Building on the creation of the new City of Montr\u00e9al, the Public Health Department Annual Report 2002 aimed to guide policy directions in urban sectors and provide information and support to decision-makers. A profile of the health in Montr\u00e9al was compiled using administrative data indicators, existing population surveys and research results.The analytical strategy consisted in: (1) comparing Montr\u00e9al to five other Canadian urban areas; (2) comparing six subregions and 29 Local Community Health Centre territories;",

The data contained 19,728 mandatory first-time inspections and 36,035 necessary follow-up inspections. Government and nonprofit affiliated eating establishments were not included in the analysis. Each inspection included information on such key areas as: name and location of the restaurant, type and length of each inspection conducted, and a breakdown of all violations issued during inspection. Results: Restaurants with staff on site that have attended the New York City Bureau of Food Safety and Community Sanitation mandated food handling instruction class have a greater chance of passing inspection and receiving a fewer number of violations. Public complaints resulting in ensuing restaurant inspections yield a low percentage of restaurant inspection failures. While the majority of restaurants are located in the borough of Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens have a higher rate of inspection failures.",

Since then, more than 80,000 cases were confirmed. We conducted a population-based study to determine the magnitude of the epidemic in the city.Methods: We obtained a two stage cluster random sample (house followed by house inhabitants), from 3 of the 9 BH City Health Department Districts, 322 in the East and 245 in the North District. Testing for Dengue 1 and 2 virus antibodies were conducted using neutralization reaction.Results: 76.98% (495 individuals) were seronegative for both viruses, 0.78% (n = 5) were positive for Den-2 and 4.67% (n = 30) were positive for Den-1 only. The South District, the richest district of the city, had just 4 (5.26%) individuals positive for both viruses, compared to 66 (20.5%) and 43 (17.5%) in the less wealthy East and North Districts.Implications: It is possible that environmental determinants increasing the risk of exposure to dengue virus are not homogenous throughout the city, indicating important inequality in the risk for Dengue infection.",

A clinical network evolved that provides free treatment to over 3000 clients throughout Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire in hospitals, neighborhood clinics, and residential shelters. This presentation will focus on acupuncture as a public health strategy and community-based practice.Methods: The presentation will describe the population the clinic serves, acupuncture utilization, public health alliances formed, participation of a Client Advisory Board, allocation of public funding and research on outcomes and studies conducted.Results: Services are utilized by a diverse community of urban residents. Forty-four percent lie at of below the poverty level and an additional 29% earn 101% to 200% of poverty standards. Twentytwo percent of out clients do not have permanent housing and 5% live in institutions. Only 2% have private insurance. The agency currently provides services to approximately 300 individuals, over half of whom are African American, Latino, Native American, African, Brazilian, and Cape Verdean. Outcomes research has indicated that treatment may be useful in managing pain and improving clients' energy and quality of life. Preliminary results of a cross-over clinical trial suggest that acupuncture may be effective in controlling digestive side-effects of antiretroviral therapy and may even improve adherence to medication protocols.Implications: The use of complementary therapies such as acupuncture should be evaluated in the context of public health standards. In particular, the need for data on utilization, access, and efficacy is crucial.",

For that purpose we devised an interactive program about blood, blood transfusion and blood donation in a fun and innovative format that was stimulating to children and encouraged blood donations from adults accompanying them.Method: New York Blood Center representatives presented three different sessions at the Brooklyn Children's Museum to children ranging in age from 3 to 12 and their parents or guardians. Each independent session focused on: Circulation and what blood is; what blood does; and why we should donate. Activities included squeezing rubber hearts to sense how hard the heart works; listening to the heart beat; pulling red yarn from a box and wrapping it around a globe more than twice to demonstrate the length of the circulatory system; enacting body parts, lungs and heart to learn how red cells exchange CO2 and oxygen; using tubing to represent veins, arteries, and capillaries to show how red cells squeeze, platelets plug a cut, and white cells attack invaders, and finally, using songs, jigsaw puzzles of blood cells, donation requirements, and distributing \"Bloodology\" booklets.Results: Over 800 attended the sessions. Their answers to true/false questions revealed comprehension.Implications: The program employed low cost materials, and is an easy way to raise awareness of blood and blood donation. It was enthusiastically received and can be adapted to any age group.",
