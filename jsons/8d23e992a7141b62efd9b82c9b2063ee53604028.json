Children were excluded if they had respiratory symptoms that had lasted 114 days at the time of admission, had neutropenia from chemotherapy, were hospitalized elsewhere within the preceding 4 days, or were newborns who had been hospitalized since birth. Study nurses enrolled children admitted to surveillance hospitals from Sunday through Thurs-day, after obtaining written informed consent. Children were eligible for enrollment if they were admitted within 48 h of an enrollment day. Nasal and throat specimens were obtained with swabs from all children on the day of enrollment (thus within 48 h of admission), combined into a single tube of viral transport medium, and promptly delivered to the research laboratories at the study sites. Demographic and clinical information was collected using a standardized questionnaire, as described elsewhere [22, 26] . We performed statistical comparisons between children infected with HMPV alone and children infected with other specific viruses alone; children with 11 virus detected in their specimens were excluded from analysis. Children were considered to be virus-negative if their specimens tested negative for HMPV, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and human coronavirus by testing methods that are described below. Highrisk conditions were assessed, which included history of asthma, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, and neuromuscular conditions such as seizures, cerebral palsy, or muscular dystrophy. History of asthma was determined by asking the parents if their child had ever received a diagnosis of asthma from any health care provider or by documentation of a previous diagnosis of asthma in the medical record [24] . Molecular testing. Specimens were divided into aliquots and stored at \u03ea80\u040aC until processing. RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and throat swab medium. Specimens were tested for HMPV by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described elsewhere [1, 27] . Specimens were also tested for influenza virus, RSV, PIV, HRV, and human coronavirus by real-time RT-PCR [23-25, 28, 29] . Specimens that tested positive for HMPV were subjected to conventional nested RT-PCR to amplify and sequence complementary DNA of the F and G genes, as described elsewhere [1] . HMPV subgroup assignment was made on the basis of either the F or the G gene; either gene reliably identifies the viral subgroup [30] . Sequences were edited and aligned with published HMPV sequences obtained from GenBank by means of the ClustalW algorithm in MacVector software (version 10.0; Accelrys). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Mega software (version 4) [31] . The data sets were resampled with 500 bootstraps, distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method, and phylogeny was inferred using the neighbor-joining method [31] .

Despite the strength of our prospective population-based surveillance system, our study had limitations. First, surveillance was performed for only 2 years at only 2 geographically distant sites (representing 2 US regions, Northeast and South). Greater regional and temporal differences in viral circulation may have been evident if the study included more years or sites, because other studies have reported substantial year-to-year variability in HMPV infection prevalence [1] . Second, institutional differences in medical practice might have contributed to variation in HMPV-related hospitalization rates, and although enrolled and nonenrolled children did not differ in demographic characteristics, unknown biases may have affected our HMPV infection burden estimates. Coinfections were present in a minority of children, but the clinical importance of these coinfections is not clear. HRV is identified frequently in asymptomatic individuals and thus is especially difficult to interpret as a codetected virus [48] [49] [50] . A large number of children in the study did not have a virus identified by means of the testing used; this could be attributable to false negative test results or to the presence of other pathogens for which we did not test. Nearly all of the HMPV-infected children had ARI symptoms and not fever alone, but we enrolled children with fever alone in addition to children with ARI. Thus, because the population-based incidence was calculated with all hospitalized children, including those with fever alone, we may have underestimated the true incidence of infection with HMPV (and other viruses) among children with ARI.
