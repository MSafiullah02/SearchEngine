The priority for all radiation oncology departments is to protect the staff and to maintain operations in providing access to those patients requiring radiation therapy services. Patients with tumors of the aerodigestive tract and pelvis amongst others often experience toxicity during treatment, and there is a baseline risk that adverse effects may require hospital-based management. Routine care during weekly visits is important to guide patients through treatment and to mitigate against the need for hospitalization. Nevertheless, hospitalizations occur and there is a risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread. During the COVID-19 pandemic, typical resources used to help manage patients, such as dental services, interventional radiology, rehabilitation and others are limited or not at all available. Recognizing the need to provide access to treatment and the anticipated toxicity of such treatment, we have developed and implemented guidelines for clinical care management with the hope of avoiding added risk to our patients. If successful, these concepts may be integrated into our care directives in nonpandemic times.",

To that end, additional management of adverse events during outpatient treatments should be carried out within the ambulatory radiation medicine clinic or patient home. Given the hospital strain during the pandemic, resource availability for non-emergent procedures was also limited. This included, but was not limited to, decreased operating room availability for cancer surgery, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement, esophageal dilation/stent placement, dental evaluation and extraction, infusion services, physical and occupational therapy, and home care services. Management of adverse effects would therefore need to be more proactive than reactive, and require more intensive management by fewer care providers.",

The vast majority of oncology treatments must proceed in a timely fashion. At [XXX], we are caring for many of the New York region COVID-19 cases and have had to quickly adjust our oncology patient management in order to keep our patients and staff safe, and reduce hospital utilization. Our multicenter radiation department spans across teaching and community hospitals as well as outpatient centers. The current pandemic is having a profound impact on healthcare resources, thereby changing the routine practice of cancer treatments. The multidisciplinary aspect of cancer care-inclusive of but not limited to surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, diagnostic radiology, pathology, clinical trials, genetic testing, social work, anesthesia, nutrition, occupational and physical therapy, pain and palliative care-is significantly limited based on the needs for care of COVID-19 patients. What was routine as recently as 4 weeks ago has been transformed radically. Fortunately, we have been able to continue providing patients advanced, high-quality radiotherapy and for the most part, concurrent chemotherapy. Despite social distancing, use of telehealth, conversion to shorter fractionation schedules, and deferment of some treatments, there are numerous patient touchpoints with the radiation care team. By nature of radiation treatments, patients are physically present within the department and interacting with team members often on a daily basis. Especially as other members of the patient's multidisciplinary care team reduce in-person interactions, the radiation care team has become the main point of interaction. This proximity should be leveraged to aggressively and preemptively manage patients during treatment.",
