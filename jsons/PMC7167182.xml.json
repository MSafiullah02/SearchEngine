From a practical point of view, the CLART\u00ae Pneumovir array assay is easy to use even if technical training is necessary to avoid false positives because of insufficient washing or overexposure of the arrays. Nevertheless, after nucleic acid extraction, the array assay takes 8 hr and is divided into two steps: multiplex RT\u2010PCR followed by hybridization. The main advantages are its high sensitivity and broader detection of respiratory viruses, improving viral diagnosis. However, the detection of multiple infections raises certain questions regarding the pathogenicity of the different viruses. Are all the viruses detected responsible for the clinical signs presented by the patient? These multiple viruses can be successive infections and molecular tests could detect a persistent genome in the absence of virus activity. This array assay is only a qualitative technique. However, quantitation should help to identify the predominant viral agent believed to be responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome.",

Multiple infections varied from 17.4% to 30% in children under 2 years of age admitted to hospital [Calvo et al., 2008; Miron et al., 2010] and were associated with higher fever, longer hospitalization, and more frequent use of antibiotics than in the case of infection with RSV alone [Calvo et al., 2008]. Infants with multiple infections are at higher risk of being admitted to a pediatric ICU [Paranhos\u2010Baccala et al., 2008; Richard et al., 2008].

This prevalence of RSV may be explained by a higher sensitivity of array assay versus RT\u2010PCR, but this point needs to be evaluated in more detail. It may also suggest that RSV may be responsible for a higher risk of hospitalization in a pediatric ICU. The detection of hRV has been greatly improved by molecular techniques [Mahony, 2008]. The prevalence of hRV was previously reported as being around 30\u201335% with multiplex RT\u2010PCR [Freymuth et al., 2006]. This study reported hRV in 24% of the samples. This could suggest that infections caused by hRV are less represented in pediatric ICU than in other pediatric units.",

            "text": "hMPV is an RNA virus discovered in 2001 and is known to induce symptoms very similar to those caused by RSV [van den Hoogen et al., 2001, 2003]. hMPV outbreaks occur predominantly in the winter and spring months, overlapping or following RSV outbreaks [Mahony, 2008]. However, there can be significant differences in the detection of hMPV across seasons from year to year. Overall prevalence is around 7%, ranging from 2% to 25% [Mahony, 2008; Gaunt et al., 2009]. Only two hMPV infections were detected in this study, probably because the study period missed potential hMPV circulation during the spring season.",

Prevalence, ranging from 2% to 11% in respiratory samples from symptomatic patients, has been reported worldwide. In most cases, as in this study, HBoV was detected in co\u2010infections with other known viral agents raising the question of its actual pathogenic role [Mahony, 2008]. However, HBoV has been associated with low respiratory infections [Kesebir et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007] and acute wheezing [Allander et al., 2007]. Even if HBoV can be found in asymptomatic patients, HBoV genome quantitation could help to identify the implication of HBoV in lower respiratory tract infections, as a high\u2010HBoV load has been reported in patients with lower respiratory tract infections [van de Pol et al., 2009]. In this study, HBoV prevalence was around 14%, higher than the prevalence usually reported [van de Pol et al., 2009], almost certainly because of the differences in detection techniques, patient recruitment and the seasonal study period. Nevertheless, Fry et al. [2007] have previously reported up to 12% of HBoV in children under 5 years of age with pneumonia.",

However, the relevance of the positive results obtained with this highly sensitive array is not easy to determine, particularly in cases of multiple infections caused by the lack of quantitation.
