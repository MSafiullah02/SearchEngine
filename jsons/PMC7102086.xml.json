            "text": "Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids (90%) and proteins (10%) lining the epithelial surface of the lung. Four surfactant apoproteins have been described: the hydrophobic surfactant protein B (SP-B) and SP-C and the hydrophilic SP-A and SP-D. Surfactant is synthesised by alveolar type II cells, stored in lamellar bodies that are exocytosed and taken up into the monolayer lining the alveolar epithelium. Traditionally, surfactant is recognised for its surface tension-lowering properties, by which alveolar collapse is prevented and gas exchange is facilitated. More recently, surfactant has been shown to have an important additional role in innate defence of the lung. Key players in this role are SP-A and D, members of the collectin family of proteins. Among their functions are binding, opsonisation and clearance of microbes from the lung and regulation of immune cell activity. Several reviews have addressed their role in detail [80,148]. Evidence is now accumulating that SP-B, SP-C and the surfactant lipids may be involved in modulation of pulmonary inflammation as well [21, 30, 44, 71, 101, 117].",

Nowadays, the potential benefit of surfactant therapy is evaluated in a wide range of respiratory disorders in both neonates and paediatric patients.

A meta-analysis of these studies plus one unpublished study suggested a significant decrease in neonatal mortality after Curosurf treatment [57]. However, three of these studies have compared a Curosurf dose of 200 mg/kg with a Survanta dose of 100 mg/kg [93, 112, 126]. When these studies were excluded from analysis, the difference in mortality after treatment with comparable doses of both surfactants was not statistically significant [57]. Malloy and colleagues reported a significant decrease in the incidence of persistent ductus arteriosus after Curosurf treatment [93]. None of the other studies found such an effect and it is unclear whether this difference may be explained by the dosing difference as well.",

A more recent study comparing Survanta and Alveofact reported a decrease in chronic lung disease (CLD) with Survanta [59]. However, CLD was defined as oxygen need at 28 days of age, a definition that does not take into account the gestational age of the infant and is generally regarded to be imprecise and outdated. There was a decrease in days on the ventilator, days on oxygen and length of hospital stay with Survanta. The need for postnatal steroids was decreased in the Survanta group as well; however, their overall use was very high compared to current standards.",

No difference in BPD incidence was detected. Dani and colleagues later showed that, when intubated and given surfactant, infants may benefit from early extubation to nCPAP [40]. Whether intubation for the purpose of surfactant administration is favourable for larger preterms with mild to moderate RDS is questioned by a recent study showing an increase in median duration of ventilation with elective intubation and surfactant [46].",

Potential side effects of intubation and high costs of surfactant administration might thus be avoided. Retrospective studies suggest that, when compared to early initiation of mechanical ventilation, early nCPAP decreases the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage and improves survival but may increase the risk for necrotising enterocolitis when nCPAP fails [2, 5]. However, only part of the infants on early mechanical ventilation received surfactant. More recent data from Te Pas and colleagues suggest that even if early nCPAP fails, it may still result in a decreased BPD risk when compared to infants intubated in the delivery room [133].",

Other potential alternatives for endotracheal administration include aerosolisation [48], bronchoscopic administration [14], nasopharyngeal deposition [77] and administration of surfactant via a laryngeal mask [22, 136].

Data on surfactant pool size and function in infants with CDH are inconclusive [33, 35, 74, 85]. Only one small, randomised trial of surfactant in CDH patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is available, showing no benefit [89].

Recently, the CDH study group has retrospectively compared the outcomes of CDH infants that did and did not receive exogenous surfactant during admission. No difference was observed in term infants [137], while surfactant administration was associated with increased mortality in preterms [85]. However, this difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for gestational age and Apgar score.

A meta-analysis of these studies showed a decreased need for ECMO in surfactant-treated infants without any relevant improvement in outcome [124]. An important difference between the two studies was the timing of surfactant administration. With early treatment (within 6 h after birth), Findlay and colleagues did report additional beneficial effects, such as decreased air leaks and shorter duration of ventilation [47]. Based on current evidence, Dargaville and Mills advocate early administration of a surfactant known to resist meconium inactivation in severely affected infants, with repeated doses when needed [41].",

Several reports have focused on the use of surfactant in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury (ALI). In paediatric ARDS/ALI patients, acute improvement of oxygenation is seen with surfactant administration [65, 94, 97, 144\u2013146]. No additional effects on outcome were noted in the first RCT [97]. In a more recent RCT in ventilated children with respiratory failure and bilateral radiographic abnormalities, treatment with Infasurf was associated with a decrease in mortality [145]. The mortality effect was greatest in the subgroup of infants (age <1 year), yet overall mortality was not significantly different after adjustment for immunocompromised status. Concerns about the study being underpowered and the increased incidence of hypotension and transient hypoxaemia in the treatment group warrant further evaluation before surfactant administration can be routinely recommended in paediatric ARDS/ALI [39]. An important determinant of surfactant response seems to be the nature of the lung injury causing the respiratory failure. Patients with direct lung injury may benefit more than do patients with indirect lung injury [145]. Future studies should address differences in ALI aetiology in the patients studied.",

It is a rare autosomal recessively inherited disease, in the majority of patients caused by the 121ins2 mutation [105]. SP-B is critical for lowering alveolar surface tension. Adding to the surfactant dysfunction caused by the deficiency of SP-B is the associated incomplete processing of SP-C [139]. In almost all cases a total absence of SP-B is present, which is invariably lethal [60]. Babies present with respiratory failure shortly after birth, only partially and transiently being responsive to exogenous surfactant administration. To date, the only therapeutic option for these patients is lung transplantation, which should be performed within weeks to months [61]. Recently, Palomar and colleagues reported that the outcome for lung transplantation in SP-B-deficient patients is comparable to patients transplanted for other reasons [111]. However, Hamvas reports that approximately half the families of children eligible for lung transplantation decline and another 30% of patients die awaiting transplantation [60].",

ABCA3 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein localised at the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies [102, 149]. In vitro studies show that depending on the mutation present, the mutant ABCA3 protein is either retained at the endoplasmic reticulum or is appropriately localised yet exhibits a decreased capacity to hydrolyse ATP [95]. The exact role of ABCA3 is unknown; however, other members of the ABCA protein family are involved in lipid transport [128]. A specific role for ABCA3 in lipid metabolism is further supported by the detection of reduced lung levels of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine subtypes in ABCA3 knockout mice, while levels of other phospholipids and cholesterol were unaffected [49]. Along with other studies, this work further suggests a key role for ABCA3 in lamellar body formation [29, 49, 103]. Abnormal lamellar body formation, surfactant deficiency and surfactant dysfunction have indeed been found in patients carrying ABCA3 mutations [20, 23, 52, 119].",

Hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids have been used in the management of ABCA3-associated disease, yet their efficiency in treating the disorder is unclear [23]. For these patients, lung transplantation is currently the only treatment option [24, 52]. However, Bullard and colleagues have recently stressed the fact that most patients described thus far were derived from highly selected populations of infants with unexplained severe respiratory distress [23]. The same group has identified ABCA3 mutations in paediatric patients with interstitial lung disease, suggesting that defects in ABCA3 may be involved in a greater range of respiratory diseases [24]. Research on ABCA3-associated respiratory disease is clearly evolving and knowledge about the disorder will increase in the near future.",

Common SP-A alleles, in interaction with the SP-B Ile131Thr genotype, have been associated with RDS susceptibility, while others seem to decrease RDS risk [56, 58]. Recently, polymorphisms in SP-C genes have also been linked to RDS [84]. The susceptibility for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is altered by polymorphisms of SP-A and SP-D, known modulators of innate immunity. In addition, associations of surfactant protein polymorphisms with extrapulmonary diseases exist, such as recurrent ear infections [113] and meningococcal disease [72].",

            "text": "As highlighted in this review, substantial progression has been made in recent years considering the role of surfactant therapy in neonatal and paediatric lung diseases. However, many questions remain unanswered. Efforts should be made to investigate the roles of nCPAP and alternative administration routes for surfactant in the treatment of preterm infants. Further development of synthetic surfactants to enhance their surface tension-lowering properties and capacity to withstand inactivation may increase future efficacy of surfactant therapy. More ideally, one should be able to stimulate endogenous surfactant synthesis in preterm infants, preferably antenatally. A potential candidate drug would be docosahexaenoic acid, which has been shown to stimulate synthesis of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid in surfactant, in preterm mice when administered to the mother during pregnancy [16]. Another promising future application for surfactant is its use as a carrier for drug administration directly into the lung. In this way drugs are allowed to act locally with minimisation of unwanted systemic effects. Possible candidate drugs include immunosuppressants [54], vasodilators [106] and \u03b2-sympathicomimetics [150]. Investigational drugs that have been administered in animal models using surfactant as a carrier include a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor [6] and recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein (rhCC10) [118]. Both agents have been shown to decrease experimental lung injury in these models. The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial characteristics of SP-A and SP-D make them attractive potential therapeutic agents as well. Administration of recombinant SP-D fragments in animal models results in enhanced pulmonary clearance of RSV [67], a reduced allergic response [45, 120, 131] and prevention of endotoxin shock [70]. However, SP-A and SP-D are very large and complex molecules, making construction of functional recombinant whole proteins extremely difficult if not impossible. Much more research is needed to evaluate a possible role for surfactant proteins in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the general evolution of gene therapy involves potential applications in the genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism, primarily SP-B deficiency.",
