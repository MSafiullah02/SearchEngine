            "text": "Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) including the non-fermenters, has caused a major public health concern all over the world [1], [2]. International travel, migration, and contaminated food products have been responsible for the spread of these microorganisms to several countries beyond their origin [3], [4]. The extensive use of carbapenems in hospital settings, particularly when the infection control practices are inadequate, has contributed to an increased prevalence of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) [5]. Spread of infection is mediated by the potential of these organisms for widespread transmission via mobile genetic elements [5], [6]. Spread of Escherichia coli acquiring the plasmid-borne carbapenemase has been reported [7]. Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negatives can cause serious nosocomial infections particularly in critically ill patients, and are associated with increased mortality rate (ranged from 44% to 70%, for bacteremia was 50%) and sometimes outbreaks [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, spread of CRE into the community is a major concern. They usually demonstrate resistant to other commonly used antibiotics such as quinolones and aminoglycosides [13], [14], [15]. Recently, pan-resistance to all antimicrobial agents including colistin and tigecycline has also been reported [16]. The limited therapeutic options available to treat patients infected with CRE have made these organisms of epidemiologic and diagnostic importance. Until date, no clear data on effective therapy of infections caused by CRE are available. Combination treatment of two or more antibiotics was shown to be more effective than monotherapy for infections caused by CRE [17], [18]. Active surveillance to detect colonized patients, implementation of strict infection control measures and contact precautions, are important ways of preventing the introduction and transmission of these bacteria in healthcare settings. Increasing prevalence of CRE isolates including CRE outbreaks in some hospitals is a growing problem in Saudi Arabia [19], [20], [21], [22]. The main purpose of this case series is to evaluate and describe the important clinical and epidemiological features of CRE infections in our institution.",

She had diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral and aortic stenosis. The patient presented two months ago to a private hospital with shortness of breath, repeated cardiac arrest, intubated and stayed in the ICU for two months. She developed bedsores in her back with large abscess requiring incision and drainage. During hospitalization, she had ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Stenotrophomonas multophilia and blood stream infection with a multidrug resistant Acinetobacter spp. for which she received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, linezolid, imepenem, tigecycline and ceftazidime. On referral to our hospital for further ICU care, the patient was sedated, hemodynamically unstable with low level of consciousness (10/15), and signs of septic shock (hypotension (123/69 mm HG), hypothermia (36 \u00b0C) bradycardia (52 beats/min). The patient was intubated (oxygen requirement of 35% pressure support) and on low dose vasopressors dose, dopamine, noradrenaline, hydrocortisone and insulin infusion. She has central venous catheter, nasogastric tube, and folly's catheter. Both pupil were dilated (5 mm) with sluggish reaction to light. Examination of the back showed a big (7 \u00d7 8 cm) infrascapular abscess. Chest examination revealed bilateral basal crepitation. Lab investigation showed hemoglobin of 9.4, WBCs 6.9 cells/mm3, platelets 33, Na 133, K 308, INR 21, urea 31, creatinine 167, and albumin 27. She was started empirically on colistin (3IU IV Q12hr), meropenem (Igm IV Q12Hr), vancomycin (500 mg IV OD) and amikacin (500 mg IVOD). Two days after admission, caspofungin (50 mg OD) was given and Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done to exclude infective endocarditis, which was ruled out as no vegetation was seen. Over the next few days, she was stable and vancomycin was suspended. Two weeks after admission, septic work up from two consecutive blood cultures (from central line and dialysis line) showed blood stream infection with K. pneumoniae resistant to all antibiotic including carbapenem except colistin. The same isolate was grown from the tracheal aspirate. The isolate was shown to be a New-Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase producer (NDM). Accordingly, she was started on colistin, tigecycline and the central line was changed. Repeated blood cultures were negative. On the next two days, the patient showed mild improvement in her clinical condition. After two weeks while on treatment, she developed a breakthrough fever and septic workup was done. Candida glabrata and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeroginosa were isolated from the blood. Tigecycline was discontinued and all the lines were changed. A repeated echocardiogram and ultrasound of abdomen were done. Ophthalmology team was consulted for suspected disseminated candidemia. The patient clinically improved and became afebrile. During her hospitalization stay, she developed persistent watery diarrhea for which colonoscopy and Clostridium difficile toxin antigen detection test were negative. Repeated blood culture grew carpapenem resistant K. pneumonia (CRE) resistant to all antimicrobial agents including colistin. The patient developed hyperkalemia (6.1), severe metabolic acidosis and deteriorated renal function, acute adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and her blood pressure dropped to 80/40 mm HG. She had multi-organ failure due to refractory septic shock and was arrested and died after 2 month of hospitalization. Laboratory testing revealed, meropenem and imipenem MICs (>32 \u03bcg/ml) as determined by E-test. The isolate was confirmed as a carbapenemase producer by the modified Hodge test of the CLSI. PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of blaNDM-1, and plasmid analysis revealed this was carried on a 98 kb.

Coagulation profile showed a picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), explained by (high PTT 70, low platelets count 105 and low fibrinogen 1.54), secondary to septicemia. He was given 2 unites of PRBCs and Vitamin K stat dose. He was started empirically on vancomycin and tazocin. During his ICU stay, he developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute lower limb ischemia (bluish discoloration, swelling and gangrene) with bilateral iatrogenic emphysema. Heparin was started. The patient's condition was complicated with acute renal failure (DIC) and septic shock due to aspiration pneumonia and UTI. He was arrested and died on the second day of admission due to multiple comorbidities. Two days after his death, blood culture grew E. coli, ESBL producer, multidrug-resistant and carbapenem resistant and the tracheal aspirate culture grew heavy growth of K. pneumonia resistant to all antibiotics except carbapenem and colistin, and moderate growth of multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Wound culture (deep infected bedsore) also showed heavy growth of E. coli, ESBL producer, carbapenem resistant and few growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was intubated in septic shock and required inotropes. During transfer, the patient had one attack of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. He was immediately started on Keppra (500 mg BID). The patient was sedated, hemodynamically unstable and unconscious (coma scale: 6/15) (BP 134/68 mm HG) (hyperthermia 39 \u00b0C) (tachycardia 127 beats/min). Laboratory investigation showed: hemoglobin 12.7 g/L, WBCs 18 109/L, platelets 332 109/L, albumin 25 g/L, creatinine 160 mcmol/L, Troponin-I 0.37 mcg/L. He was started empirically on tazocin. During his stay in the ICU, he had spikes of high temperature (40 \u00b0C). Blood culture grew gram negative bacilli which was identified as K. pneumonia (CRKP, MDRO), resistant to Tazocin, Imipenem and Ciprofloxacin and sensitive to Meropenem and Amikacin. Tazocin was suspended and Meropenem combined with Amikacin were started. Sputum culture grew Acinetobacter spp. (MDRO), sensitive to Colistin. The patient was screened for MERS CoV and H1N1, which were negative but he was still symptomatic, and the infection control team recommended continuing airborne and contact isolation. The patient condition became worse, as he had aspiration pneumonia post seizure attack. He also developed new infiltration on CXR with more requirements for inotropic support. He was started on Colistin, Vancomycin and Caspofungen and continued on Meropenem and Amikacin. The patient became in a critical condition; he was in a refractory septic shock in spite of good coverage with many broad spectrum antibiotics. He deteriorated rapidly and died on November 7, 2015. Gene expert analysis revealed K. pneumonia isolate from the blood culture as carbapenemase producer (OXA-48+).",

Unfortunately, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has been reported in many countries [5], [6], [7], [13]. Carbapenemases and porin loss combined with AmpC enzyme hyperproduction are the main two mechanisms of resistance [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Carbapenem resistance can be mediated through the production of acquired metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs) such as VIM and IMP, or non-metallo-carbapenemases of the IMI/NMC, SME, OXA or KPC families. [26], [27], [28]. Alterations or losses of porins in members of the Enterobacteriaceae have also been reported [26], [30], [32]. Results from large hospital-based surveillance studies in China of the genotypic characterization of 49 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems has shown that, moderate- to high-level carbapenem resistance was mainly due to loss or decreased expression of both major porins combined with production of AmpC or ESBL enzymes, while other carbapenemase (KPC-2, IMP-4, and IMP-8) was associated with a low to moderate level of carbapenem resistance. [24]. On the other hand, a review of 171 clinical Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. isolates from UK reference laboratory found that very few had true carbapenemases production combined with impermeability [25].",

In a report by Zowawi et al. investigating the molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance of CRE obtained from the countries of the gulf region including Saudi Arabia, The most common carbapenemases were of the OXA-48 and NDM types. No KPC-type, VIM-type, or IMP-type producers were detected [20]. In fact, the \ufb01rst two clinical cases of OXA-48-type carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the United States were isolated from patients recently hospitalized in Saudi Arabia and India [33].",

In hospitalized patients, it is important to identify CRE infections before these organisms are transmitted in the same hospital or to other health care facilities. Effective infection control policy including implementation of a notification system and infection-prevention measures when CRE are identi\ufb01ed in the laboratory is highly recommended. Identi\ufb01ed CRE infected or colonized patients should be placed on contact precautions [34]. Surveillance cultures from patients with epidemiologic links to CRE case-patients should be considered to identify additional unrecognized CRE colonized patients. Early detection of colonized cases allows appropriate implementation of contact precautions and prevents transmission to other patients and staff [35]. Active surveillance cultures have been used as part of an effective policy to interrupt transmission of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in several investigations [36], [37], [38], [39]. Only few remaining antibiotics are currently in use to treat CRE infections including, polymyxins, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, and temocillin. Combination therapy with 2 or more drugs is superior to monotherapy and associated with better survival rate [40], [41], [42]. In this series four patients died due to septic shock refractory to treatment. The combination Ceftazidime-avibactam have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating complicated urinary tract and complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by CRE isolates that produce KPC and AmpC and partial activity against OXA enzymes; however, this drug is not active against metallo-\u03b2-lactamases such as NDM, VIM, or IMP [43]. Although, all those patients had severe underlying diseases, the lack of or delay in initiating appropriate treatment might contributed to the poor outcome.",

Identification of CRKP in the urine is not always associated with urinary tract infection. Case 1 in this series, had carbapenem-resistant K. pneumonia bacteriuria (CRKP) bacteriuria during his elective admission for endoscopy, which most probably represents colonization rather than real infection. Qureshi ZA, et al. has found that, the majority of patients (80%) with CRKP identified from urine, are having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than UTI [44]. Molecular diagnosis was not performed and actual resistance mechanisms were not identified in all isolates. In conclusion, CRE infections is a growing problem in our hospital and are expected to increase in prevalence and involve other hospitals. We believe that, antibiotic stewardship and strict infection control measures are essential for preventing further spread of CRE. For the purpose of controlling the spread of CRE in our institution, we recommend considering active surveillance cultures and screening patients transferred from other hospitals or coming from highly endemic settings at admission for these organisms. Finally, more research is needed from our institution from all over the world to identify the epidemiology and molecular profile of the involved CRE associated infections.",
