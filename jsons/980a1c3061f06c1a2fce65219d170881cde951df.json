The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible etiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae must be a differential diagnosis in acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders in children. Pages 5 y/o IgM en serolog\u00eda. Es importante pensar en esta posible etiolog\u00eda ante casos sugerentes de enfermedad desmielinizante. Existe controversia sobre el papel de los antibi\u00f3ticos y si se contemplan los corticoides. Como conclusi\u00f3n, M. pneumoniae debe ser diagn\u00f3stico diferencial en afectaciones neuroftalmol\u00f3gicas agudas en ni\u00f1os.",

            "text": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is one of the most frequent causes of white matter compromise in children in school age and in young adults. It is estimated that the incidence of ADEM is approximately 0.2-0.64 cases/100 000 inhabitants/year. 1, 2 ADEM is regarded as an immunomediated inflammatorydemyelinizing disease with neurological clinic expressing generally after an infection or vaccination, with acute or subacute onset. 3 Association with an infectious agent is assumed in the majority of cases although its etiology is confirmed in only 25% of cases. The most frequent microorganisms are varicella zoster, measles and rubella, 1 although it is recommended to conduct a large battery of serologies to discard other agents such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis A, B and C virus, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, parotitis, coronavirus, Coxsackie B, other nonviral agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), Campylobacter, Chlamydia and beta hemolytic streptococcus. 1, 2 The pathogeny includes selfimmune response to a common antigen present in myelin and in the infectious agent. Participation of lymphocyte B has been described through antiganglioside antibodies (GM1) and lymphocytes T against several myelin antigens such as proteolipid protein, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein or basic myelin protein (BMP), among others. 3 In what concerns clinic expressions, the literature describes first a prodromic phase similar to a fever-like condition with high temperature and general discomfort, developing with the triggering agent the predominantly neurological and neuro-ophthalmological clinic symptoms 3-6 weeks after the initial contact. In addition, aseptic meningitis has been described as well as polyradiculitis, hemiparesis, cra-nial neuropathy, ophthalmoparesis, optic neuritis, seizures, long pathways compromise with spasticity or hyper-reflexia and cerebellar ataxia, among others. 2, 4 In addition, complications secondary to this clinic condition have been described, including mucocutaneous lesions, arthritis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhages, pericarditis and severe neurological alterations such as myelitis, meningoencephalitis or even coma. 5 The imaging test of choice is nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI) which in T2 emphasizes reversible, well-defined and hyperintense lesions in the white matter, which generally affect the thalamus and basal ganglia. Said lesions could also be found in the gray matter. Even so, images isolated in MRI are not diagnostic for ADEM. 5 M. pneumoniae is a free bacteria without cellular walls. It is a causative agent for community acquired pneumonia although it rarely causes central nervous system alterations (0.1%) 2,3 ( Table 1) .",

According to the criteria of the 2013 International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG), the diagnostic of mul- tiple sclerosis (MS) would be defined in MRI like (1) 9 or more lesions in the white matter or enhanced with gadolinium; (2) 3 or more periventricular lesions; (3) a juxtacortical lesion; and (4) an infratentorial lesion. CSF should exhibit oligoclonal bands or increased IgG index. The combination of altered CSF and to lesions in MRI (one of which must be located in the brain) could signify a dissemination criteria in the McDonald classification. 8 In children, two different demyelinizing events, separated in time and space, constitute a criterion for MS, in contrast with an ADEM recurrence in which new lesions do not appear and existing lesions would increase. 8 A study by Dale et al. compared the presentation of clinic conditions of ADEM and MS. They obtained as a demyelinizing infectious disease (74 vs. 38%, p < 0.05), polysymptomatic presentation (91 vs. 38%, p < 0.002), pyramid signs (71 vs. 23%, p < 0.01), encephalopathy (69 vs. 15%, p < 0.002) and bilateral optic neuritis (23 vs. 8%, not statistically significant) and unilateral only in the MS cases. 7 The importance of anti-MOG antibodies in childhood ADEM, above all in those caused by Mycoplasma, is described in a paper by Mol et al. in the Netherlands. It was observed that in patients with positive anti-MOG, the most frequent presentation phenotype was ADEM (56%) in children, and optic neuritis (44%) in adults. In addition, it was also associated with recurrence: 26% in children and 41% in adults, with a mean follow-up of 27.5 months. Said study also demonstrated that the majority of anti-MOG negative patients did not present relapses (89%). 9 The role of antibiotics for treating ADEM is controversial. It has not been demonstrated that a specific antibiotic treatment is able to resolve the condition.",

The first proposed therapeutic step is administering intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone (20-30 mg/kg/day, not more than 1gm/day) during 3-5 days, followed by oral corticosteroids during 4-6 weeks (evidence 2 C). If corticoids fail or patient response is insufficient, treatment would begin with IV immunoglobulins (evidence 2 C) and, failing this, plasmapheresis would be performed (evidence 2 C). 10 In what concerns prognosis, some studies have correlated ADEM with possible presentation prior to MS. A recent study by Papetti et al. comprising 91 patients has reported the evolution to MS of 21.2% of patients with ADEM, in a mean follow-up of 5.6 \u00b1 2.3 years. After a multivariate analysis, said study indicates as predictive factors the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF (p < 0.001), prior infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (p < 0.001), periventricular lesions (p < 0.001), hypointense lesions in T1 (p < 0.001) and lesions in the corpus callosum (p < 0.001). Even so, the IPMSSG has warned that an episode with the clinic characteristics of ADEM cannot be considered as the first MS events unless the course of the clinic disease fulfills the criteria described in the consensus. 7",
