We have had to halt and modify our lives on a local, national, and international level and cooperate to fight this \"invisible enemy\" in every sector (medical, governmental, industrial, economic, educational, and social). Our immediate action in AAGL has been to organize weekly webinars on subjects related to the pandemic and unite with 8 other professional women's health care societies to provide joint statements that guide our membership and others to expand their knowledge and optimize patient care during the COVID-19 crisis. This international and multidisciplinary collaboration with surgeons and medical specialists at the leading edge of the pandemic course has been an invaluable resource for global health care providers who are at earlier points on the COVID curve. COVID-19 preparedness has required flexibility due to lack of diagnostic tools to accurately detect all viral carriers and absence of effective viral therapy. Most gynecologists have halted the majority of \"non-essential\" office and surgical procedures in an effort to protect and mitigate risk for all patients and caregivers, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and maintain facility capacity for a surge in COVID-19 cases. Joint statements from the American College of Surgeons and the consortium of 9 women's health care societies have provided guidance for resuming surgical practice and reintroducing elective procedures [1] [2] . This special article provides further detailed information necessary for successful surgical and clinical reactivation for elective procedures during the COVID Era while the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a viable threat.",

Therefore, a precise modelling method for the pandemic progression is urgently needed. Real time modelling of the COVID instantaneous reproduction rate [3] is essential to predict the curve in the short term and anticipate the need for healthcare resources, preparing for a likely second wave [5] . Adequate modeling and widespread testing allowed for Germany to minimize COVID-19 mortality rates and its impact on the economy [6] . Likewise, with good strategy, institutions have the ability to increase non-COVID care and reactivate elective surgical practice and office procedures. In that sense, timing for resuming elective surgical and clinical care should be determined and monitored by a committee of local authorities, clinical leaders, and hospital administration to assess local viral prevalence, regional success of \"flattening the curve,\" testing capability, non-COVID care capacity, and PPE supply chain.",

Therefore, during re-entry, outpatient or sameday procedures should be favored over more complex cases in order to preserve hospital resources and decrease the risk of patient exposure.

Only strictly essential in-person interactions should be permitted in order to mitigate risks for both patients and caregivers. Preoperative requirements should be streamlined so that the majority of steps are accomplished by physician extenders using distance healthcare or online tools. Preoperative education should not require face-to-face interaction. While local guidelines may vary, US federal guidelines allow the preoperative history to be performed virtually within 30 days of a procedure, and an updated physical examination can be performed at the time of pre-anesthesia care unit admission. If a patient screens positive for COVID-19 symptoms, she is directed to local COVID-specific clinics (see section on recommended testing below). Laboratory testing should be consolidated to decrease unnecessary patient exposure during lab visits, and preoperative laboratory tests can be drawn at the time of COVID-specific testing. If available, patient-administered tests to rule out COVID can be obtained at home so that the patient's COVID status is known prior to obtaining preoperative labs [13] . A useful algorithm for preoperative decision making is demonstrated in Providers should employ the equipment deemed appropriate by their respective institutions. It is recommended that anyone working in the operating room utilize full PPE, which includes shoe covers, impermeable gowns, surgical or N-95 masks, protective head covering, gloves, and eye protection. [16] In the operating room and during surgery, considerations should include air flow and containment or reduction of personnel exposure to respiratory droplets during intubation and extubation. Considerations include using the \"intubation box\" originally designed by Dr. Hsien Yung Lai in Taiwan [17] ; the design is now available in the US [18] and was recently been shown to be a viable solution for reduction of respiratory droplet exposure [19] .",

While smoke filtration and evacuation are highly recommended during surgery as part of risk mitigation technique, most smoke evacuators remove up to 88% of small particles. To further reduce the aerosolization risk of viral particles (20-360nm), use of active suction is recommended prior to tissue removal, port exchange, and for desufflation at the conclusion of laparoscopic surgery. In addition, electrostatic charging of the peritoneal cavity can precipitate over 99% of particulate matter ranging from 7nm-10um in diameter. Such systems deliver a negative electrostatic charge from an ion wand to generate precipitation (e.g. Ultravision \u00ae , Alesi Surgical \u00ae ).

Insurance companies and hospitals will be looking for relief and will be forced to find ways to offset the profound economic implications brought on by the costs associated with COVID-19. It is imperative for physicians everywhere to gain an awareness of these issues and prepare for potential impact on revenue, salary, and job security.",

The postponement of non-essential surgical procedures in order to preserve resources has created back logs in our practices that we must address as we co-exist with COVID. The AAGL has forged important collaborations among national and international experts and societies to educate caregivers worldwide during this unprecedented time. This article should serve as a supplemental guide for effective reactivation to clinical and surgical practice to optimize care for the women whom we serve.",

Thorough disinfection is important because the SARS CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by respiratory aerosol droplets, close contact, and fecal-oral transmission. Therefore, extra time should be allotted per visit to allow for sanitizing work areas and patient rooms after each patient visit. The facility waiting rooms and examination rooms should be reorganized to optimize social distancing. Patient check-in should be done by smartphone, smart devices, or kiosks that are far from the person assisting at the front desk, and appropriate PPE and/or aerosolization barriers should be used to separate health care personnel and patients. Screening questions should be routinely utilized to identify COVID-19 symptoms.",
