However, their vulnerability is particularly acute presently as we are facing a critical turning point in the US response to the COVID\u201019 pandemic. Extreme social distancing (\u201csocial suppression\u201d) is likely to be the most effective tool in preventing the United States from following the recent trajectories documented in Italy and Spain,3, 4 but it will have a disproportionately negative impact on older adults. On one hand, if we are unable to decrease the rate of progression of the pandemic (\u201cflatten the curve\u201d), our healthcare system will become overwhelmed, and older adults are those at greatest risk for death from the direct effects of infection.4, 5 On the other hand, social suppression puts older adults at risk for mental and physical adverse effects from social isolation.6 All of this is occurring alongside a reduction in access to physical and mental care, and with a sustained exposure to uncertainty and fear.",

Today, these researchers have to make decisions on how to keep research participants and staff safe, and not contribute to the spread of the virus. At the same time, university and hospitals are enacting new policies regarding clinical research every day. These policies are becoming increasingly restrictive, evolving in a matter of days from \u201cbusiness as usual: wash your hands and screen for symptoms\u201d to \u201cresearch not essential for participants' health should be postponed indefinitely.\u201d One bright spot in the otherwise bleak landscape of social distancing has been the relatively rapid approval of telehealth platforms for clinical care.7, 8 The same technology could be used to continue or initiate new research studies focused on cognitive and mental aspects of health. However, it remains to be seen how institutional review boards (IRBs) will be able to handle this new development. Our conversations with clinical research colleagues across the country suggest that most of us have been caught off\u2010guard by this rapidly evolving situation. What principles should we follow?",
