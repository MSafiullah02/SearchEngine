The first successful blood transfusion was performed using a syringe by the British obstetrician James Blundell to treat postpartum hemorrhage in 1818. Subsequently, the first successful whole blood transfusion was performed to treat a patient with hemophilia in 1840 by Samuel Lane in London. Blood transfusions were avoided in the late nineteenth century because of severe reactions and high mortality.",

The first blood transfusion for surgery was performed in 1906 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. The First World War was the stimulus for the rapid development of blood banks and transfusion techniques, and the world\u2019s first blood donor service was established in 1921 by the British Red Cross. The first blood bank was established in a Leningrad hospital in 1932 and the US government established a nationwide program for blood collection in 1940 [Highlights of transfusion medicine history; http://www.aabb.org/tm/Pages/highlights.aspx].",

For microbes to be transmitted by transfusion certain attributes are considered necessary: presence of the agent in blood during the donor\u2019s asymptomatic phase, the agent\u2019s survival/persistence in blood during processing/storage, and the agent must be recognized as responsible for a clinically illness/outcome in a proportion of the infected recipients [1]. A group of experts in 2009 [members of the AABB\u2019s Transfusion Transmitted Diseases Committee] identified 68 infectious disease agents capable of being transmitted by blood transfusion [1]. However, the list now is even larger and will keep expanding as the rate of emergence of new agents from 1940 to 2004 was 3\u20135 new viruses discovered every year, 60\u201370% from animal origin that can infect humans [2, 3]. The infectious agents were classified and prioritized on risk level based on combination of scientific/epidemiological assessment, public perception, and regulatory concern into red, orange, yellow, and white categories [1]. The list did not include the well-acknowledged transfusion-transmitted agents\u2014HIV, HCV, hepatitis B virus [HBV], and Treponema pallidum.",

DENV has a low to very low [almost absent] risk of transmission in NA but moderate risk in endemic countries. However, has moderate risk for transmission in the USA but very low risk in Canada and Europe or countries where the parasite is not endemic. Orange category agents have sufficient scientific/epidemiological evidence of blood transmission risk that may support higher priority in the future. These include Chikungunya virus [ CHIKV] , potential risk as not proven transfusion transmitted; St. Louis encephalitis virus [ SLEV] , potential risk but not proven; Leishmania species low risk with blood transmission proven in possibly 10 cases mainly in endemic areas [4]; Plasmodium species are well documented with blood transmission, low in non-endemic countries and high in hyperendemic regions; Trypanosoma cruzi [ Chagas disease] is well documented to be blood transmitted, low in the USA and Europe but moderate in South and Central America. Yellow category agents have low to absent risk of blood transmission, but there is public and regulatory concern. These agents include chronic wasting disease [ CWD] prion agent, never detected in humans or donated blood; human herpesvirus-8 [HHV-8], transmitted by transfusion in Africa [5] and possible in the USA but not proven [6], and resulted in no clinical disease; HIV variants are potentially blood transmissible but never proven; human parvovirus B19 which has been proven to be transmitted by blood [four documented cases by 2009], but very low risk except for hemophilia and conditions requiring recurrent chronic transfusion and immunosuppression; avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 unlikely to be blood transmitted, but high profile for possible pandemic spread; simian foamy virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion in nonhuman primates, but never demonstrated in humans and is theoretically possible; Borrelia burgdorferi [Lyme disease agent] potentially possible but no proven cases of transfusion transmitted; and hepatitis A virus [ HAV] is very rarely transmitted by transfusion in neonatal intensive care units. White category agents represent a watch list, subject to modifications with change according to circumstances. These agents include hepatitis E virus [ HEV] which is documented to be blood transfusion transmitted in endemic regions and industrialized countries, mainly the zoonotic subtypes [7, 8]; and Anaplasma phagocytocytophilum which has been documented to be transfusion transmitted in the USA [8 cases by 2014] with potential for greater blood transmission due to high seroprevalence in some regions of the USA, unknown period of bacteremia, survival in refrigerated stored blood, and shown in animal models to be transfusion transmittable [1]. Since the AABB group publication in 2009, the list of agents was updated in 2014 with six new additions [9]. These included yellow fever viruses, miscellaneous arboviruses, XMRV, human parvoviruses other than B19, bocaviruses, measles virus, and MERS-CoV.

Syphilis was the most prevalent, especially in females and farmers in rural regions. Since establishing the blood services, China had experienced several catastrophes with transfusion-transmitted diseases in the past, but since 1998 has undergone transformative changes in donor screening and donor testing. Donor selection is now voluntary donation with fixed groups and donated blood undergoes two rounds of testing with different equipment or reagents by different personnel [11]. Since 2010, nucleic acid test [NAT] was established in several blood centers and in 2015 the government invested for nationwide expansion of NAT. However, China\u2019s blood services do not screen for other agents, which are regionally endemic and can be transmitted by transfusion. A nationwide distribution of nine potential agents that could be targeted was recently reviewed. These infectious agents include Plasmodium spp. , human parvovirus B19 [B19V], DENV, Brucella spp., severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV], Leishmania spp., HTLV, and Coxiella burnetii [Q fever] [12].",

DENV is also endemic in parts of China and blood donors in 2014 from endemic areas in Guangdong province had IgM prevalence rate of 2.4% with one donor with RNA load of 944 copies/mL. Brucellosis is endemic in the farming communities of North China and the prevalence rate among blood donors from an endemic area [Xinjiang Province] was reported in 2015 to be 1% and Brucella DNA was detected in 0.39% [13]. SFTSV, a tick-borne bunyavirus, was first described in China concentrated in the mountainous rural areas in central-eastern China with episodic outbreaks from spring to autumn. No transfusion-transmitted cases has been described and the seroprevalence rates in blood donors were 0.54% from endemic area and 0.28% from non-endemic area, and two low-grade suspected viremic samples were detected by RNA testing [12]. HEV is found worldwide and many cases have been transmitted by blood transfusion all over the world [14]. Screening of blood donors from six urban blood centers in China was reported in 2010 as showing prevalence of anti-HEV IgG of 32.6%, anti-HEV IgM of 0.94%, and HEV RNA in 0.07% among 44,816 donations [15]. HTLV prevalence in China is low and the latest nationwide surveillance in blood donors reported a rate of 0.03% in 2014 [16]. Leishmania spp. can be transmitted by transfusion and the parasite can survive in human red blood cells [RBC] in storage conditions up to 15 days [17]. Up to 2010, there were 300 cases of kala-azar reported yearly from China, mainly from Xinjiang Province and other western provinces [12]. However, there are no surveillance studies in blood donors and no documented transfusion-transmitted cases in China. B19V has been documented to be transmitted by blood transfusion and can cause RBC aplasia in the immunosuppressed [18]. Among Chinese blood donors, the B19V DNA was detected in 0.58% but was 4.8% in the Tibetan population. However, B19V DNA was detected in 54.2% of plasma pools used to manufacture intravenous immunoglobulin, factor VIII, fibrinogen, etc. with viral loads of 1 \u00d7 102 to 1 \u00d7 107 gEq/mL, which is higher than recommended by the US FDA [1 \u00d7 104 gEq/mL] [12]. C. burnetii DNA has been detected in blood donated [0.3%] of seropositive donors of 12.2% during a large outbreak of Q-fever in the Netherlands [19], but blood donor screening has not been initiated in China. Q-fever is mainly endemic in Tibet, inner Mongolia, and Western China.",

Measures to reduce TT-CMV for high-risk groups include depletion of cellular blood products [leukoreduction] and selection of CMV-negative donations. Studies indicate that newly positive CMV-IgG donors pose the highest risk of transmitting CMV as their blood contains the highest levels of CMV DNA [45].

Models estimate a residual transmission risk of 3\u201314% with occult HBV donation after HBsAg and NAT non-reactivity [47].

A study from Australia [without universal anti-HBc testing] estimated that occult HBV residual risk was 1 in 982,000 units transfused which represented 55% of the total HBV risk, and was decreasing with individual NAT identifying repeat blood donors with occult infection [49]. Data from Brazil indicate that the presence of high anti-HBs titers [>100 mIU/mL] did preclude the presence of HBV DNA in the donor blood [50].",

Cases have been reported from Europe [France, Germany, Spain, the UK], Australia, Canada, and Japan [57]. TT-HEV can occur with transfusion of RBCs, platelet concentrate, fresh frozen plasma, and pooled granulocytes. Presently, there are about 40 cases of TT-HEV with 21 from Japan and at least 17 cases of transfusion of HEV blood products not resulting in HEV infection [57]. Universal screening of blood products for HEV RNA is a very controversial topic in Europe and policies vary among countries. In 2012\u20132013 in England, 225,000 blood donations were retrospectively screened and 79 had detectable HEV RNA [1:2850], and follow up of 43 recipients showed 18 [43%] had evidence of HEV infection [58]. The prevalence of HEV viremia in blood donors vary from 1:762 in the Netherlands to 1:9500 in the USA, and the risk of viremic blood leading to infection was estimated to be 40\u201350% [59]. The risk of developing clinical infection in the recipient of viremic blood products may depend on the presence of antibodies, viral load, and volume of transfused blood. The minimal infective dose is unknown but low viral load <100 IU/mL has not been associated with HEV infection and the lowest inoculum known to lead to infection in the recipient is 2 \u00d7 104 IU [58]. HEV RNA screening of blood donations is now routinely performed in Ireland, the UK, and the Netherlands, but selective screening for use in high-risk patients is performed in some blood centers in Germany, France, and Switzerland [57].",

Most viremic patients infected with ZIKV are asymptomatic and pose a threat to the blood supply in outbreaks and low endemic spread. Moreover, ZIKV produces severe teratogenic effects, can persist in whole blood up to 2 months [70] and four possible cases of TT-ZIKV have been reported from Brazil [71, 72]. During the ZIKV outbreak in the French Polynesia of 2013\u20132014, 42 of 1505 blood donors [2.8%] were positive for ZIKV RNA and only 11 subsequently became symptomatic [73]. Puerto Rico introduced NAT of donated blood in 2016 during an outbreak and ZIKV RNA was detected in up to 1.1% [74]. Similarly, NAT of asymptomatic blood donors in Martinique in 2016 detected ZIKV RNA in 1.8% and 54% reported symptoms 1\u20136 days post-donation [75]. In the mainland USA, more than 200 locally acquired cases of mosquito-borne ZIKV infection and >5300 cases of travel-associated infection have been reported [76]. As a consequence since August 2016, all donated blood in the USA has been screened for ZIKV RNA. Over four million donations were screened with 9 confirmed positive [only on individual tested samples] for a rate of 1:480,654 donations [77]. ZIKV RNA levels in RBC varied from 40 to 800,000 copies/mL and detection up to 154 days after donation, but in plasma detected levels ranged from 12 to 20,000 copies/mL and detection up to 80 days after donation. The present plan of NAT of individual donors is projected to cost $137 million annually [78] and the cost-effectiveness of the blood donation screening exceed $1 million/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained, which is about 10 times as high as costs considered appropriate in clinical medicine [79]. The current US strategy for individual NAT for ZIKV was more recently estimated to cost $341 million per QALY and screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico [80].",

Many infected subjects are asymptomatic [approximately 25% of adults and 50% of children in outbreaks] or experience mild nonspecific viral-like illness [84]. Thus, blood may be donated during the period of viremia which occurs 1 week after exposure and lasts for about 5 days. An important pathogenic feature of B19V is the bone marrow cell tropism, especially erythroid progenitor cells, with increased susceptibility for infection with differentiation [85]. Transmission of B19V through blood products is feasible as high-level viremia regularly occurs during primary infection with >1012 geq/mL in the early phase of acute infection of asymptomatic individuals [86]. B19V is frequently found in blood and plasma donations and is more commonly transmitted by pool plasma-derived products than RBC. Transmission via plasma-derived products can occur due to incomplete clearance of the virus from the blood, high-level viremia in acute infection, and the resistance of the B19V to most inactivation procedures used in preparing blood-derived products [87].",

B19V DNA is detectable in 50\u201380% of non-inactivated factor VIII concentrates and in 30\u201350% of solvent/detergent-inactivated IX concentrates [88]. High rates of B19V DNA have been found in albumin [25%], immunoglobulin [IgG] preparations [20\u201375%], factor IX, and pooled plasma [>60%] with viral loads of 1 \u00d7 102 to 1 \u00d7 108 geq/mL [87]. Since no B19V transmission has not been documented from pooled-plasma products with less than 103 to 104 IU/mL B19V DNA, the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] imposed a limit of 104 geq/mL B19V DNA from pooled plasma [87]. Cellular blood products are found to have B19V DNA in about 1% and RBC transfusion has been associated with the transmission of B19V primarily with high-level titers of >107 IU/mL [89]. However, a recent report from Japan described persistent symptomatic B19V infection with severe thrombocytopenia transmitted by RBC transfusion low levels of B19V DNA [1.0 \u00d7 104 IU/mL] [90]. Fortunately, most patients with TT-B19V are asymptomatic but the extent of clinical disease from transfusion transmission is unknown. The development of disease is influenced by the presence of hematological and immunocompromised disorders and the immune status of the host. Three groups of patients are at particular risk for serious disease with infection. Patients with chronic hemolytic disorders [i.e., thalassemia major, sickle cell disease] may develop transient aplastic crisis with acute infection; subjects with combined immunodeficiency syndrome can develop chronic severe anemia from bone marrow failure; patients with AIDS can develop pure red cell aplasia; and fetal abnormalities [hydrops fetalis] can occur in pregnant women [87]. Methods used to ensure safety of plasma-derived products include NAT of plasma minipools and individual donations and multiple steps of viral inactivation and removal with solvent/detergent, superheating at 80\u00b0 C for 3 days, pasteurization, and nano-filtration [87].",

HTLV-1 infects five to ten million people worldwide from Africa, Asia, Caribbean, Central and South America and can cause debilitating spastic myelopathy, HTLV-associated myelopathy [HAM], and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma [ATL] [91]. HTLV-2 has not been linked with any specific disease entity but there is limited evidence that some affected patients may develop chronic neurological problems [sensory neuropathies, gait disturbance, bladder dysfunction, motor abnormalities, and mild cognitive impairment] and chronic lung infections and dermatitis [92]. HTLV-2 primarily occurs in the Americas, especially in Amerindians in North, Central, and South Americas [5\u201330% seropositivity] and in pygmy tribes of Africa; but the virus has been found in intravenous drug abusers [IVDA] in the USA and southern Europe [10\u201315%] [93]. Both HTLV-1 and -2 [primarily HTLV-1] have been shown to be transmitted by cellular blood products in Asia [first reported in Japan], Caribbean [Jamaica], and North America, but rarely recognized clinically [93]. A heart transplant recipient in France was reported to develop early signs of HAM within 4\u20135 months of TT-HTLV-1, the rapid onset most likely related to immunosuppression [94]. Two cases have been reported of ATL after TT-HTLV-1 in Taiwan in patients with pre-existing lymphoma and promyelocytic leukemia, 6 months and 11 years after the transmission [95]. Currently, many countries test for HTLV-1/2 antibodies in blood donors which may be cost-effective in high prevalence regions, but its value in high-income low-prevalence countries that perform universal screening is controversial and debatable [93]. Using a mathematical cost-effective model, it has been estimated that testing all new blood donors for HTLV costs US $9.2 million per life saved, or $420,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, when the HTLV prevalence is 1 per 100,000 [96]. When the prevalence among donors is 10 per 100,000 the cost is estimated to be US $0.9 million per life saved, or $41,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In many developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia where the prevalence of HTLV-1 is less than 1 per million universal testing of donors does not appear to be cost-effective; yet in many low- and middle-income countries with much higher prevalence antibody screening is not performed [93]. Further investigation of filter leukoreduction and pathogen inactivation methods and their cost\u2013benefit compared to antibody screening are needed to guide national blood collection systems .",

The major four Plasmodium species [P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale] can cause TT-malaria, as they can survive in stored blood even when frozen [98]. The longest interval between exposure and transmission by donation was estimated to be variable by species: 8 years for P. falciparum, 5 years for P. vivax, 7 years for P. ovale, and 44 years for P. malariae [97, 98]. TT-malaria has been described in both endemic and non-endemic countries. The risk of TT-malaria is extremely rare in industrialized countries but still a major challenge in resource-limited endemic countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In endemic countries, it is challenging to differentiate between mosquito-transmitted from TT-malaria and, thus, transmission by blood transfusion is frequently unrecognized and underestimated. Recent estimates indicate that TT-malaria is <0.2 cases per million in non-endemic countries to >50 cases per million in endemic countries [98]. Donors are asymptomatic and invariably semi-immune with low levels of parasitemia that can be missed on microscopy. Transmission is usually through whole blood or packed RBC but platelets and leukocytes seldom transmit malaria from RBC carry over.",

Blood donors are not routinely tested for malaria in most malaria-endemic countries in Africa including Nigeria.

Although non-endemic regions are at very low risk for TT-malaria, this may depend on the proximity to endemic areas. In Brazil, malaria is endemic in the Amazon River basin and non-endemic in the extra-Amazon regions, i.e., Sao Paulo state. However, a recent study found that 7.4% of blood donors from Sao Paulo were positive for P. falciparum [5.14%] or P. vivax [2.26%] [102].",

Septic transfusion reaction is most commonly from platelet rather than RBC transfusion. Estimated risk of blood products contamination with bacteria is 1 in 5000 for platelets and 1 in 30,000 for RBC [117]. There is recent evidence from the Netherlands that platelet concentrate stored in platelet additive solution is associated with fourfold increased risk of bacterial infections [118].

In a study over a 7-year period [2007\u20132013], 20 of 51,440 platelet units transfused were bacterially contaminated [0.004%; 389 per million] and only resulted in 5 septic transfusion reaction [121]. In high-income countries bacterial contamination of platelets, though the most common transfusion-transmitted infections, ranging from 0.01 to 0.07% of platelet units, but the rates are much higher in resource-poor countries such as in Africa. The rate of bacterial contamination in whole blood or RBC concentrate in 7 studies from sub-Sahara Africa average 8.8% and platelet contamination is likely much higher [122]. To prevent bacterial contamination of platelets the US FDA recommends enhanced bacterial testing or pathogen reduction/inactivation strategies or both. One system which combines ultraviolet A and amotosalen for broad-spectrum pathogen inactivation is approved in the USA and Europe [123].",

Blood use has declined significantly in the past decade in the USA, between 2009 and 2016 the number of blood units collected and distributed by the American Red Cross decreased by 26% and predictions for 40% decrease by 2020, raises the issue of a crisis in the US blood system [124].

Many of the blood donation screening measures exceed US $1 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained, which are 10 times as high as deemed appropriate in clinical medicine [125]. The key to a safe and affordable blood system is a universally applied pathogen-reduction system that can inactivate all or most viruses, parasites, bacteria, and prions that can be implemented by resource-poor and resource-rich countries alike. This would obviate the need for expensive screening by serology, NAT, and others. Several methods of pathogen reduction are already in use including Mirasol [TerumoBCT, Lakewood, Co, USA] using a combination of riboflavin and UVB light can be applied to RBC and platelets to reduce most TT-viruses including HIV, HCV, and HBV by 2.3\u20135.19 log reduction as well parasites and bacteria; INTERCEPT [Cerus Corporation, Concord, CA, USA] utilize amotosalen and UVA light has shown similar properties against viruses, bacteria, and parasites; THERAFLEX [MacoPharma, Lille, France] uses photochemical inactivation with different methods for plasma and platelets, has demonstrated efficacy against viruses and bacteria, but 2 cases of HIV transmission have occurred after treatment of plasma; solvents/detergents for treatment of plasma is very effective against a wide array of enveloped and intracellular viruses, bacteria, and protozoa and can be combined with filtration to improve efficacy; chemical alkylating agents are also under investigation [126]. Larger comparative trials are needed to find the most suitable technique that can be used for whole blood, RBC, platelets, and plasma, to prevent transfusion-transmitted infection in the future.",
