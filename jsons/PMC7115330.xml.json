Phenomenologic approach was chosen to understand the phenomenon from the perspective of study informants.18 Specifically, Colaizzi's methodology19 was adopted to approach directly the participants' experience by interviews with a semistructured guide. Colaizzi's phenomenology was chosen for 2 reasons. First, the task of phenomenology is to investigate and describe all phenomena, including all kinds of human experience, as these phenomena appear in their fullest breadth and depth.20 Second, Colaizzi's method addresses the subjects' original descriptions of their own experience and considers it necessary to formulate and integrate exhaustive descriptions of phenomena into the whole understanding.",

What kind of health care services did you experience during the quarantine, and how did you feel then? What did you think about the quarantine policy? Is there anything else about the quarantine you want to say? The interview lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour and was tape-recorded.

Adequate planning should be undertaken for the arrangement of physical settings and equipment for emergencies requiring quarantine measures, eg, equipment for temperature control (like electronic fans and blankets), portable toilet, telecommunication, privacy, and mosquito prevention. Temporal and sterilized cell phones will assist the quarantined to communicate with and get information and emotional support from health care workers and family members without increasing contamination risks.
