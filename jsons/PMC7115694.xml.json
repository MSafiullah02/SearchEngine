The key intermediate, 4-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid was prepared by the condensation of benzimidazole with aryldiazonium chloride of 4-amino-benzenesulfonic acid, which in turn prepared by the diazotization of 4-amino-benzenesulfonic acid [17]. However, based on our experience, the application of the cupric chloride for the condensation of aryldiazonium chloride with benzimidazole as suggested by Dahiya and Pathak [18] resulted in resinous (sticky) products. Therefore, the coupling was carried out by using sodium acetate along with stirring at cold conditions for the initial 3 h followed by 48 h stirring at room temperature which resulted in a solid product. For the synthesis of 4-[1-(substituted aryl/alkyl carbonyl)-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-benzenesulfonic acids, the key intermediates 4-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid has been reacted with corresponding aryl/alkyl acid chlorides which were formed by the reaction of corresponding aryl/alkyl acids with thionyl chloride. It is important to note here that the yield of most of the synthesized benzimidazoles were below 50%. The low yield of synthetic compounds may be attributed to any one or more of the following reasons [17]: a). The reaction may be reversible and position of equilibrium is unfavorable to the product; b). The incursion of side reactions leading to the formation of by-products; c). The premature work-up of the reaction before its completion; d). The volatilization of products during reaction or work-up; e). The loss of product due to incomplete extraction, inefficient crystallization or other work-up procedures; f). The presence of contaminants in the reactants or reagents leading to a less efficient reaction. The physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized compounds are presented in Table 1\n.",

In case of the MLR models derived for A. niger, the q\n2 value is less than 0.5, which shows that the developed models are invalid one. But one should not forget the recommendations of Golbraikh and Tropsha [29] who have reported that the only way to estimate the true predictive power of a QSAR model is to test their ability to predict accurately the biological activities of compounds. As the observed and predicted values are close to each other (Table 7), the QSAR model for A. niger [Eq. (7)] is a valid one.",

But it is important to note that the predictability of the QSAR models developed in the present study is highly evidenced by the low residual values. This is in accordance with results suggested by Bajaj et al. [30], who stated that the reliability of the QSAR model lies in its predictive ability even though the activity data are in the narrow range. Further, recent literature reveals that the QSAR have been applied to describe the relationship between narrow range of biological activity and physicochemical properties of the molecules [31], [32], [33]. When biological activity data lies in the narrow range, the presence of minimum standard deviation of the biological activity justifies its use in QSAR studies [34], [35]. The minimum standard deviation (Table 2) observed in the antimicrobial activity data justifies its use in QSAR studies.",

In these cases we have to develop one ot-QSAR for each target. However, very recently the interest has been increased in development of multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) models. In opposition to ot-QSAR, the mt-QSAR model is a single equation that considers the nature of molecular descriptors which are common and essential for describing the antimicrobial activity [36], [37], [38], [39], [40].",

The electronic parameter LUMO, which denotes the energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital directly relates to the electron affinity and characterizes the sensibility of the molecule towards an attack by necleophile. The contribution of LUMO in describing antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the interaction of benzimidazole derivatives with nucleophilic amino acid residue like cysteine of microorganisms [42]. The topological descriptor, i.e. the valence second order molecular connectivity index encodes information related to the degree of stargraph likeness and takes a large value for more linear molecule [43].

It may be due to the presence of the electron withdrawing nitro group. The role of electron withdrawing group in increasing the antimicrobial activity is similar to the results of Sharma et al. [44].2.The results of antifungal activity indicated that compound 18, 4-(1-octadec-9-enoyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid was effective against both tested fungal strains.3.The comparison of most effective antibacterial and antifungal compound gave information that the aromatic acid substitution at N1 of benzimidazole is required for antibacterial activity and aliphatic acid substitution at N1 of benzimidazole is required for antifungal activity. This indicated that different structural requirements are essential for binding of drug to bacterial or fungal targets respectively [45].4.None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations.\n",
