Identification of pneumonia causes in the context of robust immunisation programmes is an ongoing priority for child health. Case-control studies undertaken in high-income countries have reported viral pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to be a major cause of pneumonia in children vaccinated with 13-valent PCV (PCV13),7, 8 but data are few from low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore most causal data comes from cross-sectional samples of pneumonia cases admitted to hospital, but cause might vary with patient age or severity of disease.",

We identified case-only, cross-sectional, or case-control studies predominantly from high-income countries. These studies reported reductions in admissions to hospital for pneumonia during childhood after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) with viral pathogens commonly detected. However, scarce comprehensive causal data are available after 13-valent PCV (PCV13) introduction, especially in low-income and middle-income countries where the predominant burden of pneumonia occurs. Furthermore, available data focus on cases admitted to hospitals, are cross-sectional, seldom include comparison with a carefully selected control group, and rarely investigate comprehensively for potential bacterial and viral pathogens in different specimens.\nAdded value of this study\nWith a unique design we did a nested case-control analysis of organisms associated with pneumonia in an African birth cohort study, using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques. Vaccination coverage, including for PCV13, was high. The incidence of pneumonia was high, especially for children in the first 6 months of life with about a third of cases requiring admission to hospital. Several organisms were identified at the time of pneumonia onset. Respiratory synctial virus was the predominant pathogen and occurred early in infancy. Other organisms strongly associated with pneumonia were Bordetella pertussis and influenza virus, whereas bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were less strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of both induced sputum and nasopharyngeal specimens identified the presence of significantly more potential pathogens, including B pertussis and some viruses compared with testing only nasopharyngeal specimens.\nImplications of the available evidence\nChildhood pneumonia remains an important public health problem despite the introduction of PCV13. Several organisms might cause this disease. An induced sputum specimen adds value to the diagnostic work-up even in young infants. New vaccines and novel strategies to prevent pneumonia, such as immunisation of pregnant women against respiratory synctial virus, are needed.\n",

K pneumoniae and Legionella spp were omitted from this analysis because of difficulties with assay specificity. Standard curves were derived with plasmid standards supplied by the manufacturer for each organism.",

Dependent variables of interest were organisms from FTDResp33, analysed as binary (present or absent) and continuous (log copies or specimen) values. Model building examined potential confounding factors identified a priori from demographic and clinical measures of child's sex, in-utero HIV exposure, maternal age, maternal smoking, and socioeconomic status; because no clear confounding factors were consistently identified based on appreciable changes in the point estimate for pathogen\u2013pneumonia associations, models presented account for matching factors only. Because children might have had more than one episode of pneumonia (and thus participate in more than one case-control set), we also examined mixed-effects models with children and case-control sets as random or fixed effects, and also conditional logistic regression models restricted to first case episodes. We based co-organism analysis on matched case-control pairs, investigating the presence or absence of two organisms at a time. Of 16 possible response patterns, seven involved co-occurrence, with the less than one, one, or more than one pattern of co-occurrence in both cases and controls not adding information that differentiated cases from controls. The observed frequencies of the remaining six response patterns were compared with their expected values based on the hypothesis of random co-occurrence with a Pearson \u03c72 test. Multiple p values for different organism pairs were corrected with use of the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate. We did subsidiary analyses to stratify case-control comparisons on pneumonia severity and control children's symptoms. Throughout, regression diagnostics followed standard procedures, and all statistical tests were two-sided at \u03b1=0\u00b705. We used Stata (version 13.0) and R (version 3.2.2) for data analyses.",

In our study, many children had wheezing associated with RSV, raising the question of whether these were cases of pneumonia or of bronchiolitis. In our study we applied WHO pneumonia definitions because they are widely used for their high sensitivity. Furthermore, pneumonia and bronchiolitis are a spectrum of LRTI, representing different manifestations of infection or host response. Of note, RSV occurred in young infants with the peak incidence in those younger 6 months, as has been previously reported.17 Maternal immunisation against RSV during late pregnancy might therefore be an attractive novel strategy to prevent disease in young infants.22\n",

            "text": "Bacterial\u2013viral co-infections have been reported to be important, especially in severe pneumonia.23 In an African PCV9 trial,24 immunisation reduced hospital admissions for viral LRTI by a third, suggesting that pneumococcal\u2013viral co-infection leads to severe pneumonia. Another study23 reported that an increasing number of co-infections was associated with more severe disease and higher mortality in children admitted to hospital with LRTI. However in our study, the only bacteria associated with pneumonia were B pertussis and H influenzae. B pertussis occurred in young infants and mostly before completion of the three immunisations; immunisation of pregnant women with B pertussis might be effective to prevent this burden.25 The observed association between H influenzae and pneumonia supports recent evidence suggesting that non-typeable H influenzae might be an important pathogen in pneumonia.26 Although the strength of the association was relatively weak, since H influenzae was identified in more than half of cases the contribution of this organism to pneumonia might be substantial. The absence of an association of other bacteria with pneumonia could reflect several possibilities. High PCV13 coverage reduces pneumonia incidence, as described in other settings.4, 6, 27 In a USA case-control study7 of children admitted to hospital for pneumonia who had received PCV, more than two-thirds were reported to be due to viral causes (with RSV predominating) whereas only 7% of children had bacterial\u2013viral co-infection. Additionally, bacterial\u2013viral co-infection has been predominantly associated with severe or very severe pneumonia,23, 24 but in our study most cases were non-severe pneumonia. Finally, bacterial causes might be especially difficult to ascribe because of high rates of colonisation. Specimens from the upper respiratory tract might be of little use to establish bacterial causes. Research is needed to understand interactions between organisms and the role of several potential pathogens.",

            "text": "Defining the aetiology of pneumonia might be challenging. To obtain a representative sample from the lower respiratory tract might be difficult in young children and contamination with colonising organisms, such as S pneumoniae, could occur.11 This contamination might lead to an underestimation of the contribution of bacteria causing pneumonia. Similarly, although new molecular diagnostics enable detection of many respiratory viruses and less easily culturable bacteria, distinguishing live pathogenic organisms from those colonising or infecting the upper respiratory tract or residual nucleic acid from previous infections is difficult.9 Taking samples from the upper respiratory tract, therefore, restricts inferences of causality regarding lung disease. Furthermore, multiplex PCR identifies a broad range of potential pathogens, but the sensitivity for individual pathogens might be lower than a singleplex PCR. Sample quality is another key determinant of the accuracy of a diagnostic test, but we could not verify the quality of samples, or normalise quantitative results to a host target. A strength of this study is the use of different or several specimens, which increases detection of organisms. In a pre-PCV Kenyan study18 of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia, culture or PCR of blood, induced sputum, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal specimens led to incremental detection of organisms. However, with a case-control analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs, RSV was the only significantly associated pathogen.18 Similarly, although our study was able to detect several potential pathogens through intensive specimen collection and use of sensitive assays, the case-control analysis showed significant associations with pneumonia for only B pertussis, H influenzae, RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, bocavirus, and cytomegalovirus.",

Of note, induced sputum was obtainable in young infants and in those with severe pneumonia. Although the value of induced sputum for microbiological confirmation of tuberculosis in children has been shown in large studies,10 in our study its use showed a substantial incremental yield for B pertussis and for some viruses associated with pneumonia. A Kenyan study18 found induced sputum increased the yield of potential bacterial pathogens compared with blood culture, and detected a virus in more than half of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia. However, there was discordance between results from induced sputum and blood culture samples.18 A Finnish study28 reported that a potential bacterial or viral pathogen was detected by PCR in 97% of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia with an adequate induced sputum sample.

First, selection of cases and controls from a large prospective cohort allows inferences that extend beyond those afforded by case-only designs, while minimising for selection biases in previous studies of pneumonia causes. Second, investigation of causes by pneumonia severity (including ambulatory cases and cases admitted to hospital) and control symptomatology allows more definitive examination of pathogen associations. However, our study is still limited by absence of data for longitudinal nasopharyngeal colonisation to attribute causes at the time of pneumonia onset. Longitudinal analyses are underway to address this issue and to further study co-pathogens. Although we might have missed some cases of pneumonia, the pneumonia surveillance systems, longitudinal review of patient records, and excellent cohort retention ensured that this was extremely rare. These results might not be generalisable to low-income and middle-income countries with lower levels of immunisation coverage or in countries where H influenzae type b or PCV are not included in immunisation programmes. However, the uptake of H influenzae type b and PCV globally including in Africa has increased,29 so these results are likely to be widely applicable in low-income and middle-income countries. Our study provides important new information on the association between specific organisms and pneumonia after children have received PCV in a middle-income country, but also highlights the complexities in ascribing causality and in defining the role of several organisms in childhood pneumonia.",
