Typhi), from either an acutely infected person or a chronic carrier [1]. Children are disproportionately affected with increased incidence seen between 5 and 14 years of age [2]. Over the past century, public health efforts, including improved sanitation infrastructure, access to clean water, and availability of effective antibiotics, have contributed to the decline of typhoid fever incidence and complications, including intestinal perforation, in high-income countries [2, 3]. In the USA, there were an estimated 350 cases of typhoid fever annually from 2008 to 2015, with an associated mortality rate of less than 1% [4]. The majority of these cases were due to travelers from endemic areas [1]. In comparison, typhoid fever continues to be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, especially in pediatric populations, where incidence peaks in children five to nine years of age [5].",

This is especially true in medically resource poor areas, including sub-Saharan Africa, which often lack access to specialized surgical and postoperative care. In addition, TIP occurs more often in children, with increased mortality rates when compared to adults [7]. In the 1960s and 1970s, TIP-associated mortality rates in all ages ranged from around 30% in Ghana [8] and India [9] to about 60% in Nigeria [6]; a reported rate of 30.5% was seen in a study of Guatemalan children [10]. Since 1990, mortality rates in some endemic areas have decreased to between 3 to 13% in Pakistan [11, 12], Nepal [13], and Iraq [14], with a study from Turkey reporting a rate of 4.8% in children [15].

Other currently available vaccines have limited duration of protection and are only recommended for children two years of age and older, making it difficult to incorporate these vaccines into the routine immunization schedule [16]. Importantly, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), committed to co-finance the TCV in eligible countries, the majority of which are located in sub-Saharan Africa [17, 18]. In order to assess the full impact of this vaccine and help inform country decisions on introduction, understanding severe complications is essential. The last mortality-focused review of TIP worldwide was published in 1994 and included all ages [19]. As a review of TIP specific to children living in sub-Saharan Africa has not been done, current mortality rates are unknown. For these reasons, we conducted a scoping review to obtain mortality rates due to TIP in children, under 18 years of age, living in sub-Saharan Africa, in order to summarize and update the field and to identify gaps in current knowledge.",

From 1984 to 2018, mortality rates ranged from 4.6 to 75%. In the data available since 2000, 79% of the reported mortality rates were between 10 and 30%. Although these numbers are moving in the right direction, they are still unacceptably high. In a tertiary care hospital in Ghana, the mortality rates for the two included studies did not change over a 10-year period, remaining just over 12% [25, 27]. Due to limited data, only one paper each from the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Niger was included, making it impossible to determine temporal trends. The cities of Enugu, Ibadan, Ife, and Ilorin in Nigeria each had two studies, without overlapping time periods, allowing for a percent change in mortality calculation [24, 28, 32, 36, 38, 39, 43, 44]. Findings showed a declining mortality trend overall within these cities, with the percent change ranging from a 15.6% decrease in Ife to a 56.3% decrease in Ilorin. This data should be interpreted with caution, however, given the wide ranges of study years these mortality rates represent, some including data from over 10 years, and the varying number of study participants. In the Ibadan, Nigeria study from Irabor [32], the overall mortality rate for the 15-year study period was 21.3%. However, when separated into five-year intervals, the mortality rate increased from 15.8 to 30.4% during the entire study period. Consistent reporting of yearly mortality rates by authors would allow a more accurate calculation and interpretation of overall mortality rate trends for this region.",

Late presentation by patients due to a delay in diagnosis, as well as difficulty accessing adequate medical care in rural areas, was common [43]. As all the hospitals included in this review were tertiary care centers, many of the patients had presented to outpatient clinics or traditional healers prior to admission. Many patients had sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities on admission requiring preoperative resuscitation. These factors led to a prolonged perforation-to-surgery interval, which has been shown to increase morbidity and mortality [29, 38, 41, 44]. In addition, the number of perforations present, lack of access to critical care management or an intensive care unit, and inadequate culture data to guide antibiotic therapy contribute to poor outcomes [7, 35].",

Surgical site infection was the most reported complication followed by ECF formation and wound dehiscence. Similar to the high mortality observed with TIP, these complications are likely a result of the late presentation of patients, inadequate or inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, and extensive peritoneal contamination with feculent material leading to dirty wounds. Evisceration was reported in nine studies [21, 24\u201326, 33, 34, 41, 42, 44] which led to additional surgical procedures and mortality rates ranging from 25 to 100% in the four studies that reported mortality [21, 25, 41, 44].",

This is especially true in many LMICs where, due to the lack of resources for management of this problem, including access to total parenteral nutrition, patients are dying from high-output fistulas. Fifteen studies [21, 24\u201326, 28, 29, 32\u201335, 37, 39, 41, 42, 44] reported this as a complication with a mortality rate ranging from 40% in one study [21] where five ECFs were seen to 75% in two studies [26, 41] with four patients each. High postoperative morbidity rates lead to increased hospital length of stay, which in turn causes an undue financial strain on families who have to pay for medical bills and stay at the hospital to help provide postoperative care for their loved ones [44, 45].",

The prevention of typhoid fever with routine immunization of children with TCV, in conjunction with improved sanitation infrastructure and robust community education on health and proper hygiene practices, is ideal [21, 22, 27, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37\u201341, 43]. However, once a child has typhoid, proper interventions to stop disease progression are lifesaving. Many authors reported on the need for a higher suspicion of typhoid when a child presents with a fever, as often they are first diagnosed with and treated for malaria [21\u201323, 26, 29, 31, 39, 43]. This assumption of malaria delays proper antibiotic treatment and allows progression of the disease, which can lead to TIP. Additionally, educating caretakers on the signs and symptoms of typhoid fever, its complications, and when to go to a health center or hospital are essential to ensure children are presenting early in the disease course, not weeks after onset [21, 22, 31, 40, 44]. If TIP does occur, prompt recognition will help decrease the perforation-to-surgery time internal, an important factor which could have a considerable impact on morbidity and mortality [22, 23, 25, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 44].",

            "text": "Many publications in this review relied on clinical aspects to diagnose TIP. Perforations due to typhoid usually occur in the terminal ileum and are widely thought to occur due to necrosis of Peyer\u2019s patches, leading to ulceration and perforation. This produces a recognizable lesion of an oval perforation located longitudinally along the antimesenteric border (Fig. 3) [46]. When seen in conjunction with clinical signs for typhoid fever, this lesion is normally considered pathognomonic; however, other causes of non-traumatic bowel perforation can be hard to rule out, especially when culture data are unavailable. For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) enteritis and intestinal tuberculosis (TB), which can present similarly to typhoid fever, can be rare causes of perforation mostly seen in the colon, duodenum, and ileum [47\u201350]. Intestinal TB more often presents with ulcerations, with the long axis located perpendicular to the long axis of the bowel [49, 50], unlike in TIP. CMV enteritis is usually seen in immunocompromised patients, especially in conjunction with HIV, and has no associated seasonal variation [47, 48, 51]. In contrast, typhoid has been shown to have a seasonal incidence, and five of the papers showed correlations between TIP and the usual typhoid season in their region [27, 32\u201334, 40].",

The percentage of S. Typhi positive cultures among suspected cases ranged from about 25% to 50% for blood, stool, or peritoneal fluid. Many patients present later in the disease course, with some having already taken an antibiotic, lowering the sensitivity of cultures.

First, it is highly likely that studies were missed due to publication in local or regional journals. Second, even without language restrictions, our search only resulted in the inclusion of four non-English studies. It is possible research from this region is published in languages other than English or French and is not readily available to international readers. Third, the data presented are limited to 6 of the 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 75% from Nigeria. While there were additional papers from other countries with data from adults, studies specific to the pediatric population are lacking. As incidence and severity of TIP are increased in this age group, and as this is the population that will benefit most from the new TCV, having pediatric-specific data is imperative.",

In the case of Ghana, both studies were from the same urban health center, which makes it difficult to extrapolate these data countrywide. Additionally, all the studies were from tertiary healthcare centers, with the majority retrospective in nature. This can lead to referral and selection biases, which again can make it difficult to generalize to surrounding regions and likely underestimate the actual mortality related to TIP. It is highly probable that many children with TIP die before they ever reach a tertiary care center.",

The new WHO recommended single-dose TCV is now available for children over six months of age and was recently shown to be 81.6% efficacious in preventing typhoid fever in a randomized, controlled clinical trial in Nepal [52]. Thus far, only Pakistan, India, and Zimbabwe have begun to use this vaccine. In response to a typhoid outbreak in early 2019, Zimbabwe implemented a mass vaccine campaign which resulted in a decrease in typhoid cases seen among children [53]. In addition, Pakistan was the first country to introduce TCV into its routine immunization schedule beginning in November 2019 [54]. It is anticipated that the prevention of typhoid fever, with the help of TCV, will likewise lead to reductions in TIP and its associated morbidity and mortality [21, 22, 32, 34, 37\u201340, 43]. Continued international support, especially from Gavi, will help to ensure that every child living in sub-Saharan Africa has access to this important vaccine.",

In addition, strengthening health systems, with improved access to care and surgery, and ensuring proper utilization by patients could also help to decrease the perforation to surgery interval, which is associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality [55]. Unfortunately, WASH improvements and systems strengthening are difficult and expensive to implement in the short term in LMICs. Thus, vaccination becomes that much more important in this setting. Additional research is needed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural areas, to highlight the burden of typhoid fever, and its complications, and to catalyze efforts to properly treat, and ideally prevent, this disease.",
