We have employed an automated literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first knowledgebase dedicated to COVID-19, which integrates such large variety of related biomedical entities through literature mining. Proper investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified interactions among those, reported in COVID-19Base, would help the research community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.",

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes the alarming pandemic of COVID-19 since February 2020 [2] . While the novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) have gained enormous attention and grave concern as a consequence of the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic situation, other known human coronaviruses, beta coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS, OC43, HKU1) and alpha coronaviruses (229E, NL63), historically, caused a significant level of public-health concerns and resulted in severe respiratory syndrome for the patients as well [3, 4] . To combat the global lethality of COVID-19, it demands an urgent solution for the detection and therapeutic treatment, which requires a comprehensive experimental elucidation of biomedical entities (e.g., genes, non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), viruses, drugs, etc.) [5] that are involved in this disease. But this is a relatively slow process due to the inherent nature of the experimental validation. As an alternative, in silico methods are also proposed by multiple research groups [6, 7] . Still, it is also a daunting task due to a large number of possible combinations of biomedical entities that need to be examined [8] . To mediate these two extreme experimental setups, and at the same time, to enable a comprehensive exploration of potential therapeutic treatments, knowledgebase based solutions are proposed, as part of this study, for the scientific community to focus on a smaller number of biomedical entities that may guide to the discovery of a novel solution of the COVID-19 treatment.",

For example, in ViRBase [9] , the authors highlighted the association between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and viruses in 20 hosts. VISDB database, based on literature mining, integrated the virus interaction site in humans for five DNA oncoviruses and four RNA retroviruses [10] . The Virus Pathogen Resources (VIPR), developed a portal collecting a comprehensive set of information related to coronavirus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), other viruses [11, 12] . But none of the mentioned databases are much useful for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, as those databases were not specific to novel coronavirus, or they provide very limited information about the associated genes, ncRNA or do not cover other associated factors that are involved in coronavirus-related diseases, drugs and their side effects. Moreover, there exists no such knowledgebase that has integrated all biomedical entities specific to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. To fill this gap, we develop the first comprehensive knowledgebase, COVID-19Base, that integrates several biomedical entities that are associated with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 from the scientific literature.",

We also apply the concept of cosine similarity [36] to confidently infer the associations between diseases and genes, lncRNAs, miRNAs.

So we decide to check and remove any abnormality from our collected data before going into the next stage of the pipeline. We use unsupervised anomaly detection [17] for doing this job. Unsupervised anomaly detection technique detects anomalies in an unlabeled dataset by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the dataset under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the dataset are 'normal'. We use K-Means clustering algorithm [18] as it has been used for anomaly detection in several studies [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] . We proceed as follows. First, we use Doc2Vec [24] to create a numeric representation of each document associated with each disease-drug pair. Then we fit these representations into our Kmeans model and observe two clear clusters of easily discriminable sizes, where the smaller one consists of only 161 instances. As we know that anomalies differ from the normal instances significantly and occur very rarely in the data, we can assume that the instances of the smaller cluster are indeed anomalies. We also check a number of instances manually to verify our assumption. We discard these 161 instances from any further consideration.",

We weigh this value by dividing it by the distance between the word and the centroid of its cluster to describe the extent of its potential positive or negative-ness. Then we calculate the tf-idf score [27, 28] of each word in the sentence collection to consider the significance of the unique words. Next, we build a tf-idf representation, T, for each disease-drug pair by replacing each word of the corresponding sentences with its tf-idf score and a sentiment value representation, S, by replacing each word with its sentiment value.

It consists of 1 input layer with 3 neurons (each neuron corresponds to one input feature), 2 hidden layers with 8 and 4 neurons respectively, and 1 output layer containing 1 neuron for binary classification (positive or negative). The transfer functions of the first and second hidden layers are Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) [31] and Hyperbolic Tangent function (tanh) [32] respectively. The transfer function of the output layer is a Sigmoid function [33] . We train the DNN model using Xavier initialization [34] which tries to make the variance of the outputs of a layer to be equal to the variance of its inputs. We use Adam optimizer [35] and the maximum training epoch is set to 500. We split our labeled data into training and test sets on an 80:20 ratio. We train our model on the training data and achieve 75% accuracy on the test set. Fig. 3 shows the workflow of extracting disease-gene associations. We extract gene names along with lncRNAs and miRNAs from the CORD-19 literature in a dictionary-based approach using HGNC [40] , LNCipedia [41] , and miRBase [42] . Then we extract their associations with diseases in a similar process that we have used to extract the disease-drug pairs and collected all the abstracts where a co-occurrence was found. Next, we apply the concept of cosine similarity [36] to confidently infer the associations. We transformed each disease into vector V1, each gene (and lncRNA, miRNA) into vector V2, and then calculated the cosine similarity of V1 and V2 for each pair. To create the vector representations, we train a Word2Vec model with all the collected abstracts. We use the DisGeNET [37] database as the gold standard to evaluate the performance of cosine similarity in predicting the gene-disease linkage. First, we calculate the maximum, average, and minimum cosine similarity of the pairs that are common both in our findings and in the DisGeNET database. We find that 99.7% of the newly discovered pairs lie within this range (in terms of cosine similarity). We further classify the associations in three classes (high, medium, and low) in terms of confidence as follows: pairs having cosine similarity closest to the maximum (minimum) of the known ones are considered as high (low) confidence associations, and the remaining ones (closest to the average) as medium confidence associations. Moreover, pairs that are also found in the DisGeNET database are labeled as verified associations. ",

Our model finds it as a positive (i.e., effective) drug with 57.89% confidence (note the significantly lower confidence score than that of Remdesivir). But it is also revealed from COVID-19Base that this drug has 111 side-effects including Anaemia, Haemorrhage, Liver disorder, Hepatitis fulminant, Cardiomyopathy, Cardiac failure, etc., which makes it a risky option especially for patients with heart and liver complications. Informatively, although the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) had previously granted authorization to use this drug for Covid-19, it recently cautions against its use outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to its' side effects and risk factors. 2",
