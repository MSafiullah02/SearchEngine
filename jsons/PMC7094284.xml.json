Proponents of early separation consider it economically beneficial (due to an increase in saleable milk) and ethically preferable (as it is thought to preclude formation of a maternal bond that becomes progressively more difficult to break; Flower and Weary, 2003).",

For example, Faubert and Litvinsky (2000) claim that this practice reduces the risk of Cryptosporidium parvum infections. Muskens et al. (2003) make a similar claim for Johne's disease, and Daugschies and Najdrowski (2005) for eimeriosis. However, such literature does not always cite evidence to corroborate these assertions. The concern over disease transmission stems from the agammaglobulinemic state of the neonatal calf and its heightened susceptibility to disease during this time. Artificial feeding of calves is thought to allow better control of colostral quality and quantity and thus improve transfer of maternal immunoglobulins to the calf. Moreover, the dam's fecal coliform count increases by up to 107 cfu during the periparturient period (Pelan-Mattocks et al., 2000), leading to a concern that calves permitted to remain in the calving area are at an increased risk of exposure to pathogens (McGuirk, 2008).",

Thus, allowing the cow and calf to remain in contact presents a mosaic of purported health benefits and risks, for which there is a lack of consensus. The aim of the present review is to provide a critical and systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on the health implications of cow-calf contact versus artificial rearing; our companion paper (Meagher et al., 2019) presents the results of a parallel review on the effects of cow-calf contact on measures of behavior, welfare, and productivity. A synthesis of conclusions from the literature is required to offer a measure of resolution to this debate.",

Conversely, 2 studies (Svensson et al., 2003; Roth et al., 2009) reported a greater risk of scours in dam-reared animals. Roth et al. (2009) hypothesized that the higher incidence in nursing calves could be explained by the increased quantity of milk consumed by these animals, rather than by infectious causes. Indeed, Wagenaar and Langhout (2007) reported that the type of scouring sometimes observed in suckling calves was characteristically distinct from that of bucket-fed counterparts, primarily because it did not lead to the animals dirtying their backsides. Boonbrahm et al. (2004a) found that mortality from scours and other conditions was higher in bucket-fed calves (15%) compared with dam-reared calves (0%), again suggesting a different etiology. It is now well known that high volumes of milk may contribute to looser manure in calves (see Khan et al., 2011), which need not reflect any infection. Methods of evaluating scours in calves should therefore take into account differences in fecal consistency associated with level of milk intake.",

This lack of consensus may stem from variation in study design and outcome measurements (e.g., herd versus sample-level prevalence), in breed (dairy versus mixed dairy-beef), or in the diagnostic methods chosen. Despite the conflicting results, the collective burden of available odds ratios and risk ratios is skewed toward a protective effect of suckling.",

            "text": "The hypothesis regarding biological relevance is not unfounded because calves under 6 mo of age are most susceptible to MAP infection. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis may be transmitted from an infected dam to calf in utero or through direct bacterial shedding into colostrum or milk; however, MAP infection occurs predominantly by means of a contaminated environment, via the fecal-oral route (Lombard, 2011). We may thus imagine that prompt calf removal could mitigate transmission. Several mathematical models (e.g., Collins and Morgan, 1991; Marc\u00e9 et al., 2011) have demonstrated that removing the calf from the calving area, or minimizing the effective number of cow-calf contacts, reduces MAP prevalence, but such models are often parameterized based upon an assumption that transmission increases for calves contacting adult animals. Yet, in some herds, cow-calf separation has supplanted control strategies for which concrete evidence exists to tie the respective strategy to a reduction in MAP prevalence. For example, Wells and Wagner (2000) noted that herds in which cows and calves were separated at 1 h (compared with >24 h) were more than 3 times as likely to have had a previous Johne's disease diagnosis. The authors posit that herd managers altered their management practices following the positive herd status report. In contrast, the practice of sourcing >25% of animals from outside dairies was associated with a current Johne's disease diagnosis in the herd, yet no evidence was provided to suggest that this practice underwent a similar modification (Wells and Wagner, 2000). Johnson-Ifearulundu and Kaneene (1998) reported that the process of cleaning maternity pens was linked to a 3-fold reduction in the odds of a positive herd-level MAP status. However, many commercial herds allow multiple animals in the calving area (e.g., 59% in the United States; USDA, 2016) or permit sick cows to be housed in these areas (25%). Of those herds that did use dedicated individual maternity pens, only 20 to 34% (depending on herd size) cleaned the area after each calving (USDA, 2016). There is evidence for a synergism of infection risk in the calving area, based upon the level of environmental cleanliness, udder hygiene, and presence of other lactating animals (Beaver et al., 2016). The evidence we have reviewed indicates that prompt calf removal should not be viewed as a substitute for proper hygiene and management in the maternity area.",

(1995) described a positive association between suckling and immunoglobulin absorption in neonatal calves, and Selman et al. (1971) found that the presence of the dam led to improved passive transfer. In contrast, several articles concluded that suckling results in higher levels of FPT (Nocek et al., 1984; Besser et al., 1991; Trotz-Williams et al., 2008b; Beam et al., 2009). This discrepancy may, in part, be traced back to the source and quantity of colostrum offered to control groups. It is now well established that quantity, quality, and promptness of colostrum administration is pivotal in facilitating immunoglobulin absorption and thus lowering the rate of FPT (see Godden, 2008). The current recommendation stipulates that calves obtain 10 to 12% of their BW in colostrum at first feeding, and additional benefits have been shown in calves receiving further doses of colostrum at 12 h postpartum (Godden, 2008). In several of the older studies (Stott et al., 1979; Quigley et al., 1995), the volume of colostrum fed to control groups would be considered insufficient by today's standards, and is likely not comparable to the amount a suckling calf would obtain from the dam. Moreover, in Stott et al. (1979) the colostrum provided to control calves was pooled; pooling has been reported to increase the bacterial burden, leading to inhibition of immunoglobulin absorption (Stewart et al., 2005). Thus, differences in FPT between dam-reared and artificially raised calves may be attributable to colostrum allowance.",

Because these herds likely differed in a variety of other dimensions, and successful immunoglobulin absorption is affected by numerous external factors (Godden, 2008), it is difficult to isolate the effect of suckling. Besser et al. (1991) made some effort to measure colostrum quality in all groups, but large volumes were fed to the control animals, and the authors acknowledge that these would far exceed the expected intake of a suckling calf. In Nocek et al. (1984) and Beam et al. (2009), calves fed high-quality and promptly administered colostrum were compared with an unmonitored suckling group, with unknown colostral quality and latency to feed. Thus, the same concerns regarding insufficient colostrum allowance (Stott et al., 1979; Quigley et al., 1995) are replicated, but in this case, are transferred to the suckling group.",

Calves may exhibit a higher latency to suckle if they have low vigor or if the dam has experienced a difficult calving (Rajala and Castr\u00e9n, 1995). Thus, the farmer cannot rely upon nature alone but rather should supervise and intervene if necessary to promote adequate passive immune transfer to the calf. Calves born to dams with low-hanging udders (Ventorp and Michanek, 1992) may also have more difficulty obtaining colostrum by suckling, suggesting that these calves in particular could benefit from active assistance with nursing or administration of colostrum by bottle. Together these observations indicate that various types of farmer intervention, including careful observation and supplementary feeding, may be beneficial regardless of whether the calf is separated from the cow.",

Additionally, bacteria in colostrum can multiply precipitously when kept at ambient room temperature and may even reach concentrations exceeding 1,000,000 cfu/mL after 48 h of refrigeration (Stewart et al., 2005).

The reasons for this variation are likely similar to those previously described for the FPT outcomes. That is, conventionally reared calves may be at risk when study methodology results in inadequate colostrum uptake (as in Quigley et al., 1995). Insufficient colostrum quantity has been definitively linked to FPT, which, in turn, has strong associations with mortality (see Godden, 2008). Similarly, dam-reared calves may experience increased mortality rates when colostrum intake is unmonitored, unaided, or not quality-controlled. The confounding of dam rearing with low-input management may account for the conclusions from large-scale, multi-herd studies such as Jenny et al. (1981) and Wells et al. (1996). Indeed, Jenny et al. (1981) stated that farmers leaving calves with the dam may wrongly assume these calves have obtained sufficient colostrum via suckling. In contrast, farmers separating the calf and dam must undertake the \u201cmothering role\u201d themselves and provide individualized attention.",

(2016), the studies reviewed here demonstrate a beneficial effect of suckling systems in reducing the risk of mastitis in dairy cows. In addition to the advantages of suckling to remove residual milk from the udder, reduced mastitis rates in suckled cows could be attributed to lysozymes for bacterial inhibition present in calf saliva (Mdegela et al., 2004). No study in our systematic review demonstrated an increased risk of IMI in suckled cows; however, one study did report higher rates of teat damage (Thomas et al., 1981). This damage was most pronounced in cows suckling 4 calves twice daily for 8 wk compared with machine milking. These authors recommend nursing for shorter durations to prevent the temporary teat damage associated with continuous, long-term suckling. Walsh (1974) found that the greatest benefits in mastitis prevention afforded to nursing cows were in early and mid-lactation. Together, these results suggest that producers interested in reducing the risk of mastitis should consider the use of suckling, particularly in early lactation (see also K\u00e4lber and Barth, 2014).",

In sum, the evidence presented in this review does not support the recommendation of immediate separation to promote calf health. Specifically, we found no consistent evidence of increased risk of pneumonia in calves reared with the cow; however, the available literature on this subject was limited and often did not address the subject of respiratory health as a primary research objective. With respect to enteric health, the majority of studies demonstrated that rearing the calf with the dam had no effect on scours, or was associated with a reduced risk. Future research should aim to identify differences in etiology (e.g., infectious versus nutritional causes) between scours in dam-reared compared with artificially reared calves. The leading cause of mortality in dairy calves is diarrhea, for which a wide variety of enteric pathogens are responsible (Cho and Yoon, 2014). With the exception of C. parvum (for which the evidence was mixed), common pathogenic causes of scours in the dairy calf have not been evaluated in detail in artificial compared with suckling systems (apart from the work of Klein et al., 2013, and Quigley et al., 1994).",

In their review, Flower and Weary (2003) address retained fetal membranes and cite the Danish work of Krohn et al. (1990), which highlights a beneficial effect of suckling on lowering the risk of placental retention. Flower and Weary (2003) suggest that this evidence could partially explain the lower incidence of retained fetal membranes in beef compared with dairy cows (Noakes, 1997). Another study demonstrated no effects of immediate calf separation on latency of placental expulsion or placentophagia (Lidfors, 1996). Given the importance of postpartum diseases on the longevity and productivity of dairy cattle (Mulligan and Doherty, 2008), this area of research requires further exploration.",
