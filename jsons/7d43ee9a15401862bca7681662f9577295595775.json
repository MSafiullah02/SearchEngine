Their activation makes it imperative to identify methods that can deliver a diagnostic result at low cost. This paper describes an approach which employs sequence variation in the gene coding for its envelope protein as the basis for a scalable, inexpensive test for COVID-19. It achieves this by coupling a simple RNA extraction protocol with low-volume RT-PCR, followed by E-Gel screening and sequencing on highthroughput platforms to analyze 10,000 samples in a run. Slight modifications to the protocol could support screening programs for other known viruses and for viral discovery. Just as the $1,000 genome is transforming medicine, a $1 diagnostic test for viral and bacterial pathogens would represent a major advance for public health.",

For example, one widely adopted protocol employs RT-qPCR to screen for a 112 bp amplicon of the E gene for initial diagnosis followed by Sanger sequencing of a 95 bp segment of the RdRp gene for confirmation (Corman et al. 2020, Public Health Ontario 2020). The adoption of standard protocols has aided quality assurance, but it has constrained the volume of testing because reagent kits are in short supply (Sharfstein et al. 2020 ) and costs ($50-$100 USD per test) are high (Medicare 2020) . As well, because workflows are complex, analytical results can be delayed for a week, limiting their value for the suppression of community spread. Although cassette-based RT-qPCR assays can deliver results in less than an hour (Vashist 2020) , these instruments process too few samples at a time (<10) to support the large-scale surveillance programs (i.e. 100,000 samples per day) planned by many nations (Department of Health & Social Care 2020).",

As the sample acquisition bottleneck has been broken, there is a need to increase analytical capacity, and this will be achieved most easily by employing infrastructure and expertise in existing genomics facilities. A fully distributed solution involving many low-volume labs would bring complexity to quality assurance and control. System management would be greatly simplified if a few core facilities were established, each initially processing 10,000 samples per day with subsequent increase as need arises. To support this production strategy, analytical approaches must scale effectively. Solutions have been proposed, ranging from new technologies (Schmid-Burgk et al. 2020 ) to augmented Sanger sequencing (Chandler-Brown et al. 2020 ), but they are not fully ready for implementation. By contrast, highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing has a wellproven capacity to characterize many thousands of samples in a run (Hebert et al. 2018) .",

Results should ideally be available within a day to curb community transmission and costs become increasingly important as surveillance programs expand. For example, a white paper from the Rockefeller Foundation (2020) proposes that the USA analyze 30 million individuals weekly at an estimated annual cost of $150 billion. Because reliability is also essential, protocols must minimize the incidence of false positives and negatives (Wickramaratna 2020 , Winter 2020 . False positives typically arise from cross contamination or when tests lack specificity while false negatives reflect a lack of sensitivity or analytical mishap. Achieving required sensitivity is complicated by the fact that viral loads vary greatly among individuals and throughout the course of infection (Lescure et al. 2020) . For example, To et al. (2020) report millionfold variation (10 3 -10 9 per ml) from symptomatic individuals. Presuming adequate sensitivity, false negatives can still arise because of analytical error, but this risk can be evaluated by including controls spiked with synthetic RNA. The risk of false positives can be evaluated by including blank controls, but the best defense involves running a separate assay on a fresh sample when the first test is positive.",

Similarly, although SARS and COVID-19 are strains of a single species within Sarbecovirus, they have a mean divergence of 5.3% versus intrastrain values of less than 0.1% (Figure 1b) . Reflecting this fact, there are 11 diagnostic substitutions and a consistent 3 bp deletion between most sequences of the E gene from COVID-19 and SARS. Examination of all genome sequences for COVID-19 in the GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017) on April 15, 2020 further revealed that 98.5% of the 6,300 most reliable genomes (high coverage, >29 kb) possessed an identical sequence for the E gene.

RNA extraction follows He et al. (2017) with minor modifications. Sample analysis begins with the transfer of 100 \u00b5l from each tube into the corresponding well of a 96-well Extraction plate (1.2 ml Abgene Square) pre-filled with 100 \u00b5l of guanidine thiocyanate buffer (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 160 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM sodium citrate, 200 \u03bcg/ml of glycogen, 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9) held at 75\u00b0C on a Peltier block. After 15 min of lysis at this temperature, the plate is cooled to 20\u00b0C before 200 \u00b5l of 100% ethanol and 13 \u00b5l of magnetic beads (SpeedBeads, 10 mg/ml) are added to each well, at which point the FX mixes the beads and lysate by repeatedly (5x) aspirating/returning 90 \u00b5l aliquots from each well. The plate is then incubated on the deck at 20 o C for 5 min to allow RNA/DNA to bind to the beads before they are harvested with a magnetic bead extractor (VP 407AM-N1-R-MagPin R). The extractor is covered with a disposable cover plate (VWR 82006-636) to allow bead recovery from multiple Extraction plates without contamination (Oberacker et al. 2019) . A new cover plate is added before the extractor is submerged into each Abgene plate for 2 min to collect beads with bound DNA/RNA. Beads are then immersed in a Wash plate (Costar) pre-filled with 150 \u03bcl of 70% ethanol (in DEPC-treated water) by moving the extractor up and down three times with a 20 sec pause between each immersion. The wash steps are repeated in a second Wash plate before the beads are air-dried for 30 sec on the extractor before DNA/RNA is released into an Elution Plate (Eppendorf V-bottom microplate -E951040188) pre-filled with 50 \u03bcl of DEPC-treated water by dipping the extractor into the plate for 1 min. It is then removed and the cover plate is discarded at the plate-stripping station before the extractor is returned to its dock.",

Where implemented early and pursued vigorously, these actions suppressed infection rates. However, limited analytical capacity and high costs have meant that only symptomatic individuals were tested in many nations, a strategy that has seen infection rates rise, in part because many individuals with COVID-19 are asymptomatic (Nishiura et al. 2020) . In response, some nations (e.g. UK) have now adopted stringent physical distancing with the goal of reducing infections to the level where it becomes feasible to reactivate contact tracing and testing.",

By avoiding RNA extraction kits, employing low volume RT-PCR, and using high-throughput platforms for sequence characterization, both end points (Gel + sequence) can be achieved for less than $5 USD per sample.

In fact, if just one end point is pursued (E-Gel or sequencing), the material costs for the current protocol nearly meet this target ($1.55 for E-Gel, $1.42 for S5). Group analysis (Dorfman 1943 , Edouard et al. 2015 can further reduce costs by 80% in settings where comprehensive testing is undertaken if infection rates are low (<2%). With this approach, pooled samples from multiple individuals are initially analyzed and individual testing only examines members of infected pools. By coupling the targeted analysis of a single gene region with group tests, comprehensive screening programs can be established at very low cost. This creates a new imperative; it is essential to identify inexpensive methods for sample acquisition as they currently exceed $10. The shift from nasopharyngeal to saliva samples is a key advance, but further work is needed to optimize protocols. In short, mass screening programs need innovation along the entire analytical chain from sample acquisition to report synthesis.",

There is also a need for comprehensive testing in settings where confinement (e.g. old age homes, prisons) raises the risk of outbreaks. When it comes to broader societal monitoring of Ro, schools provide an ideal venue because students represent 10-15% of the overall population and provide a window into the incidence of infections in a larger subsample (i.e. their parents). Moreover, their organization in groups of about 20 is ideal for group testing. For example, with a population of 15 million, Ontario has 2 million students who are educated in 100,000 classrooms. Given this demographic, group testing could assay infections in every class for less than $1 million per week, about 0.1% of the annual education budget (FAO 2019). Perhaps COVID-19 will be suppressed through the rapid development of a vaccine, but a quick exit from the current pandemic should not be an excuse to delay development of the capabilities needed to deal with a future pathogen whose suppression requires deep surveillance to reduce its Ro.

A 96-well head on a FX liquid handler employs 20 \u03bcl tips (Beckman Coulter P20 AP96 barrier) to transfer 1 \u03bcl of RNA extract from four 96-well Elution plates into a 384-well plate (Eppendorff twin.tec LoBind skirted) prefilled with 5 \u03bcl of Superscript IV One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher) spiked with 100 copies of a 368 bp gBlock synthetic DNA oligomer (Integrated DNA Technologies) which serves as an in-well positive control. The gBlock included two important modifications from the reference E gene sequence (26225..26493 GenBank NC_045512.2): a 100 bp random sequence was inserted 62 bp from the 5' terminus and a short inversion was sited 111-132 bp from the 5' terminus. Plates scheduled for Sanger sequencing also contain 0.1 \u03bcM of the F and R primers for the E gene (Integrated DNA Technologies) in each well. Plates destined for Sequel are pre-made in sets of 24 with each of the 9,216 wells containing a different primer pair (96F, 96R), each with a distinct 16 bp Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), allowing every sequence to be linked to its source well (Figure 3). The same primer structure is used for the S5, but the UMI labelling is simpler because the wells in each 384-well plate can share the same set of primers (16F, 24R) because the amplicons from different plates are discriminated by secondary indexing after RT-PCR (Figure 2). Each 384-well plate includes four negative and four sample-free positive controls, the latter containing 100 copies of synthetic RNA for the E gene. After assembly, each plate is placed in a 384-well PCR block for RT-PCR (reverse transcription at 55 o C for 10 min is followed by PCR cycling that begins with denaturation at 98 o C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 98 o C for 10 sec, 55 o C for 10 sec, and 70 o C for 12 sec in the first 30 cycles versus 30 sec in the last 20 cycles, before a final extension at 72 o C for 5 min). The extension time for the first 30 cycles of PCR is too brief to allow amplification of the gBlock, but the longer extension time allows its amplification during the final 20 cycles.",

Data Analysis: Four band configurations are possible for each E-Gel lane. Negative samples show a single band positioned at 368 bp derived from the gBlock control while positives can either possess two bands (one from the 221/263 bp amplicon of the E gene and one at 368 bp from the gBlock) or one band corresponding to the E gene when viral loads are high.

Following analysis, the E gene sequences are mapped to their source plate by examining their Index and to their source well by examining their UMIs. Because only the duration of the first two steps increases as number of plates rises, the overall analytical time is 19 hours for five plates versus 22 hours for 50.S5 Data Analysis:Raw data are demultiplexed via their plate-level indices by the onboard S5 Torrent Browser before sequences are analyzed using a cloud-based informatics pipeline supported by two platforms, mBRAVE (mbrave.net) and BOLD (boldsystems.org). Each read is assigned to its source well by examining its two UMIs before the primers, adapters, and UMIs are trimmed. Sequences are then filtered for quality and length and dereplicated.
