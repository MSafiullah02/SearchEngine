The incidence of persistent CMO (pCMO; defined as CMO present after 3 months) following uncomplicated surgery is uncertain. We wished to identify the incidence, management and visual outcomes of such patients. Methods A Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (SOSU) questionnaire was sent monthly to every ophthalmic specialist in Scotland over an 18-month period from 1st January 2018 asking them to report all new patients with pCMO confirmed on OCT scanning following uncomplicated cataract surgery. A follow-up questionnaire was sent 9 months after initial presentation. Results Fourteen cases of pCMO were reported, giving an incidence of 2.2 cases of pCMO per 10,000 uncomplicated cataract surgeries. Mean age was 74.9 years (SD 10.2; range 44-86) with a male preponderance (72.7%). Two patients developed pCMO in each eye. Six cases (46.2%) had hypertension and one had diabetes. Three eyes required intracameral adjuncts (two iris hooks, one intracameral phenylephrine). Postoperative visual acuity (VA) at 3 months was logMAR 0.48 (0.2-0.8). Average mean central retinal thickness (CRT) at 3 months was 497microns (270-788). The most common initial treatment comprised topical steroids and topical NSAIDs (61.5%). Other management strategies included systemic steroids, intravitreal steroids and oral acetazolamide. At 1-year post-op, mean VA was logMAR 0.18 (0.1-0.3) with average mean CRT of 327microns (245-488). Conclusions We identified a low incidence of pCMO following uncomplicated cataract surgery in Scotland (0.02%), with inconsistent and variable management regimes. A nationally agreed treatment protocol is required.",

Known as Irvine-Gass syndrome for the past 60 years, patients commonly experience good vision in the immediate post-operative period, followed by a painless central visual deterioration a few weeks later [7] . CMO is believed to result from a post-operative inflammatory response [11] . The incidence of postoperative CMO peaks at 4-6 weeks, but most cases are self-limiting, though visual impairment can persist, with duration of CMO reported to range between 72 and 249 days [12] . Aside from the personal impact of visual impairment, the overall Medicare cost of modern cataract surgery complicated by CMO has been reported to be 47% higher than for those without [13] . It is generally accepted that the incidence of CMO has reduced significantly due to refinement in cataract surgical techniques, including the switch from extracapsular cataract surgery to phacoemulsification [14] [15] [16] . However, this incidence is variable, and further influenced by type (acute/chronic/ persistent) and method of detection (clinical, angiographic, optical) [11] . For example, the incidence of angiographic CMO has been previously estimated to be as high as 30% in uncomplicated cataract surgery cases [11] . In addition, the widespread use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has increased the ability to detect both clinical and sub-clinical CMO, which could further influence quoted incidence rates [10, 17] .",

A small case series of randomised patients to topical prostaglandin analogues (bimatoprost, latanoprost, and travoprost) noted 6 (12.5%) patients subsequently developed angiographic CMO, although only one had an associated loss of visual acuity [25] . All these cases of angiographic pseudophakic CMO subsequently resolved on cessation of prostaglandin analogues and commencement of topical diclofenac [25] . However, other groups have reported no significant increase in clinical CMO with topical prostaglandin analogues [3, 4] . Interestingly, our two patients with glaucoma were being treated with topical beta-blockers rather than prostaglandin analogues. Wendel et al. showed that apart from prostaglandin analogues, topical beta-blockers are also associated with the development of pseudophakic CMO. Through analysis of 508 cases and 5080 controls, they found the incidence of pseudophakic CMO to be statistically significantly associated with the current postoperative use of both topical PGAs [relative risk (RR), 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-3.32] and topical betablockers (RR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.08-6.49) [8] .",

These findings are consistent with a deficient blood-retinal barrier function in those patients with more advanced diabetic retinopathy vascular changes. Recent retrospective studies have documented incidence rates of postoperative CMO in diabetic patients to be between 0.1% and 2.35% [12, 30] . In our study only one patient had diabetes (without active diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy before cataract surgery). This patient did not receive any prophylactic topical NSAIDs. A report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology in 2015 advised that peri-operative topical NSAIDs are effective in reducing the occurrence of pseudophakic CMO, may increase the speed of visual recovery postoperatively in diabetic patients, but do not alter long-term visual outcomes beyond 3 months [5] . [6, 7, 9, 14, 26, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . A recent review of CMO by McGhee's group in Auckland concluded that \"there are limited evidence-based clinical studies available regarding successful treatment strategies, and there is substantial inconsistency between studies in terms of defining successful outcome measures, with some focusing on improvements as measured by OCT or fluorescein angiography vs visual acuity outcomes\" [29] . They noted that visual improvement doesn't always correlate with angiographic improvement, and spontaneous resolution of CMO can be a major confounder in any attempted analysis of true treatment effects [29, 38] .",

In this large RCT study investigating prevention (not treatment) of 914 patients, they discovered that patients treated with a combination of topical NSAID (bromfenac 0.09%) and topical steroid (dexamethasone 0.1%) had a lower risk for developing clinically significant macular oedema after cataract surgery than patients treated with a single drug. However, it should be noted that this study ended at 12 weeks and did not continue onto evaluate any patients with pCMO. While our study patients (looking at treatment) are different to the PREMED group (looking at prevention), 50% of our eight cases on combination topical NSAIDs and steroids treatment had resolution of CMO at 1year post-op follow up. Of the other four remaining cases with pCMO, three had evidence of epi-retinal membrane causing cystic spaces on OCT scans at 1-year post-op.",

Such a study may be difficult to perform due to the variability in management strategies, but would be useful to guide treatment, as there is a significant additional cost to frequent return clinical appointments following cataract surgery (47% higher costs as per Schiemer) [13] .",

The evidence to support the efficacy of peri-operative subconjunctival steroid is limited, but it is notable that this step is now often omitted in modern cataract surgery. Mirroring this change in clinical practice, we identified only one case who had received subconjunctival steroid injection in our cohort (i.e. 92.3% of our cases of pCMO did not receive subconjunctival perioperative steroid at the end of surgery).",

Such BOSU/ SOSU surveillance studies are widely recognised to result in lower incidence rates than in real-life due to the inherent potential for under-reporting by observers [19] . Furthermore, because routine post-operative cataract reviews have been devolved to community optometry in Scotland, the identification rate may be lower from optometric practices without OCT. The SOSU methodology meant our study could only identify patients who had been referred back into the hospital system and were under the care of an ophthalmologist. We also have no knowledge of optometric independent prescribing behaviours, which could also have suppressed the incidence numbers. Our study had a followup of 18 months postoperatively, yet only identified 14 cases. It is difficult to develop management recommendations from such a small number. The patients originated from different Scottish Ophthalmology departments which use different OCT devices, which could influence the reporting of macular thickness, as some machines measure retinal thickness from the internal limiting membrane to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), while others use Bruchs membrane as the outer retinal boundary. It must be recognised that OCT interpretation on different machines is not standardised across the Scottish ophthalmic departments. Equally, it is not possible to standardise the follow up and review arrangements in each hospital for these patients, so we had to use the closest appointment information for the 3 month and 12 month post-operative data. In addition, bias due to failure to report can negatively impact any survey regarding the incidence of surgical complications, as has been previously reported in the literature looking at the validity of reporting capsule rupture data events [42] . However, while these issues may influence the true incidence in our study, we believe this SOSU study does provide accurate information as to the real-world current management of patients with persistent CMO post routine cataract surgery in Scotland.",

At 1-year post op review, average mean CRT was 327 microns (range 245-488 \u03bcm). Five eyes still had pCMO on OCT scanning. Of these five cases, three had evidence of epi-retinal membrane. The difference between CRT at presentation (3 months following cataract surgery) and at 1-year post op for 10 patients was not statistically significant (p = 0.27) (Two-way ANOVA).
