            "text": "The incidence of pneumonia has varied widely in a number of published surveys, largely reflecting the types of populations that were evaluated and the era of the study. A very high incidence was reported in the series by Finland (8) and Hopwood (9) in the years before 1965 ranging from 6.3 per 1,000 deliveries to 8.5 per 1,000 deliveries (8, 9). Benedetti et al. examined 89,219 deliveries in a university and county hospital setting from 1972 to 1975 (10) and documented a lower incidence of pneumonia (0.4 per 1,000), with only 1 in every 2,288 deliveries being affected. Madinger et al. studied 32,179 deliveries at a community hospital from 1983 to 1988 and found pneumonia to complicate 1 out of every 1,287 deliveries (0.78 per 1,000) (11). Berkowitz and LaSalsa examined 1,120 case records at a large city hospital from 1988 to 1989 and found that antepartum pneumonia occurred in 1 of every 367 deliveries (12). This pattern of an apparent decrease, followed by an increasing incidence of pneumonia complicating pregnancy in recent years may reflect the fact that women with chronic illnesses are now able to become pregnant, and there is also a rising prevalence of immune deficiencies (such as HIV infection) and illicit drug use in pregnant women. However, Munn and colleagues (13) estimated the prevalence of antepartum pneumonia to potentially be much lower, ranging from 0.78 to 2.7 per 1,000 deliveries.",

In the first, Jin et al. found the rate to be similar to the non-pregnant population, with reported rates of hospitalization for pneumonia of 1.51 per 1,000 deliveries versus 1.47 per 1,000 in non-pregnant controls (14). In a similar study, comparing the incidence of CAP in pregnant women and non-pregnant age-matched controls presenting to a hospital, the incidence was 1.1 per 1,000 and 1.3 per 1,000, respectively (15). Thus, compared to earlier studies, the incidence of pneumonia in pregnancy has declined, but the rates may be higher in large urban hospitals than in community settings, reflecting the different populations at risk. In addition, the available data generally come from those who are seen in a hospital, and may not reflect milder forms of illness seen in a physician\u2019s office.",

            "text": "There are very few formally collected data sets about nosocomial pneumonia in the pregnant or post-partum patient, but one form of pneumonia that falls into this category is aspiration pneumonia complicating labor and delivery. In fact, Mendelson\u2019s original description of gastric acid aspiration was made in obstetric patients undergoing labor and delivery (16, 17). In the 1960s, as many as 2% of all maternal deaths were due to aspiration (17). The pregnant woman is physiologically predisposed to aspiration because of elevation of the intragastric pressure due to the gravid uterus, a relaxed gastroesphageal sphincter due to the circulating progesterone, and delayed gastric emptying that accompanies pregnancy. These factors, coupled with sedation and analgesia that may be given during labor, increased abdominal pressure and vigorous abdominal palpation during examinations and extraction of the baby, all increase the threat of aspiration. The incidence of this complication has declined over time, with an increased awareness of the problem and with efforts directed towards prevention. In Mendelson\u2019s original series, the incidence was 1 in 667 deliveries, but in the 1970s, the rate was as low as 1 in 6,000 vaginal deliveries, but still 1 in 430 Caesarean sections. More recent studies of Caesarean section patients report a rate of 1 in 1,431 to 1 in 1,547 (17). Mortality from this complication has been very low in recent years, with one death in 9,200 pregnancies (17).",

The same study also found that there was no significant difference in maternal age or parity between the women who have pneumonia during pregnancy and those who do not (18). In a case-control study of 59 women with pneumonia and 118 controls, using multivariate analysis, both anemia (measured as hematocrit of 30% or less) and a history of asthma were found to be independently associated with a fivefold increased risk for the development of pneumonia (13). The study also reported the use of a tocolytic agent to delay labor as a risk factor for development of pneumonia. In another case-control study of 37 pneumonia patients and 74 controls, the use of antepartum corticosteroids was associated with a higher rate of infections (64.5% versus 17.5%) including four pneumonias in previously healthy women (19). In one series of 71 women with CAP, 31 had underlying chronic diseases, although their presence did not lead to an adverse outcome (20). In other series, women with CAP have had a high frequency of cigarette smoking and drug abuse.",

While other studies have found an association between asthma and pneumonia in pregnancy, none demonstrated an incidence as high as reported here.

Alterations in cellular immunity have been widely reported during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimester, generally thought to protect the fetus from \u201crejection\u201d by the mother. These include a decreased lymphocyte proliferative response, decreased natural killer cell activity, changes in T cell populations with a decrease in circulating helper T cells, reduced lymphocyte cytotoxic activity, and production of substances by the trophoblast that block maternal recognition of fetal major histocompatibility antigens (2, 22). In addition, hormonal changes during pregnancy including elevation of progesterone, human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha fetoprotein, and cortisol may also inhibit cell mediated immune function (22). These changes can predispose to infection with certain pathogens such as viruses, fungi, and tuberculosis. Catanzaro et al. (23) have shown that the hormonal changes lead to an increase in 17-estradiols, which can enhance the in vitro growth of Coccidiodes immitis (17).\n\n",

Pneumonia in pregnancy carries an increased risk of adverse outcomes when compared to pneumonia in non-pregnant women (2, 3, 10\u201312, 24). In older data from the US Department of Health and Human Services (1), 2,475 maternal deaths were examined from the years 1974\u20131978 and approximately 1% of these (24 deaths) were a result of pneumonia, which served as the most common non-obstetric infectious cause of mortality. Mortality data from the state of Massachusetts show that infection-related deaths in pregnancy have declined from 8.8 per 100,000 live births in the years of 1954\u20131957, to 0.6 per 100,000 births in 1982\u20131985 (25). Although pneumonia is an uncommon cause of death among all pregnant women, the mortality rate can still be quite high among those who do develop pneumonia in pregnancy. In the preantibiotic era, the maternal death rate was observed to be as high as 32% of all such cases (10), but in more recent series, the mortality attributable to pneumonia in pregnancy declined to 8.6% in one study (9), while in another there was no maternal mortality (10). Yost et al. found no deaths in 133 episodes, Jin observed no mortality in 333 pneumonia episodes in pregnancy, and Shariatzadeh et al. observed no maternal deaths in 28 pneumonia episodes (14, 15, 18). On the other hand, Richey and colleagues found 5 out of 71 pregnant women to have adverse outcomes including two maternal deaths, one early abortion, one preterm labor, and one fetal death (20). These women tended to have more severe illness, with a lower initial mean oxygen tension, more diffuse radiographic pneumonia, and were more likely to be current smokers. In other more recent series, complications were also common, but mortality was not high, even when women with comorbid illnesses were evaluated. In one series, of the 25 patients studied, 40% suffered multiple complications including five requiring intubation, two developing empyema, one with pneumothorax, one with pericardial tamponade, and one with atrial fibrillation (11), yet there was only one maternal death, occurring in a patient with cystic fibrosis.",

The majority of poor fetal outcomes occurred in mothers with underlying comorbid illnesses such as chronic respiratory disease, or other maternal disease (11).

Berkowitz et al. noted a 12% rate of SGA babies and women had infants who weighed 400 g less than randomly selected patients without pneumonia (12). In this series of 25 patients, most pneumonias were in the second and third trimesters, full-term delivery occurred in 14, one had preterm delivery, three underwent voluntary termination of pregnancy, three had term SGA babies, and four were lost to follow-up. Munn et al. found that pneumonia patients delivered babies at a significantly earlier gestational age than women without pneumonia, were more likely to deliver before 34 weeks, and their infants weighed significantly less (13). Yost and colleagues reported that the women with pneumonia had babies that were 150 g smaller than seen in the overall population, and the frequency of low birth-weight infants was 16% in the pneumonia population versus 8% in the general population. In addition, they observed a trend to more preterm labor in the women with pneumonia (18). In another recent series, women hospitalized with CAP had a relative risk of SGA babies of 1.86 (14).",

Benedetti et al. reported a 2.6% rate for intrauterine fetal death and Madinger et al. noted a 12% neonatal death rate (10, 11). On the other hand, no excess fetal death was observed in recent series, including the comparison study by Yost and colleagues and in the study by Jin et al. (14, 15, 18). One study found an association between drug and alcohol abuse with preterm delivery, but not with low birth-weight (14).

Preterm labor as a complication of infection may be the result of the uterine response to certain mediators of infection and inflammation (11, 13). McGregor has hypothesized that certain bacteria induce the production of phospholipases, proteases, and prostaglandins that can induce labor, although these speculations evolved with cervicovaginal infection in mind (31). Lung infection is known to induce a similar compartmentalized inflammatory response, which has now been well documented in the non-pregnant patient with pneumonia (32). It is quite possible that the cascade of mediators released by the active host inflammatory response to infection could exert distant effects on the uterus, leading to a high rate of labor during the course of pneumonia",

The relative incidence of infection with any given agent is difficult to estimate without the use of comprehensive methodology to diagnose the etiologic pathogen for pneumonia. The available data are derived mainly from observational, and often retrospective, studies where only routine microbiological investigations have been used. Sputum and blood cultures were the main methods of diagnosis (Table 13.2\n) (2). Hopwood (9) identified a responsible pathogen in only 9 of 23 cases, with a mixture of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and Influenza A virus being implicated. Benedetti et al. (10) found a bacterial pathogen in 21 of 39 patients, with pneumococcus serving as the predominant pathogen, accounting for 13 cases, and Hemophilus influenzae being the second most common organism isolated. Madinger et al. (11) also found Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) to be the most common, followed by Hemophilus influenzae as the second most common pathogen isolated. In these studies, serologic testing was rarely performed to search for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila. Berdowitz\u2019s series (12) also found pneumococcus and Hemophilus influenzae as the most common pathogens.\n\n",

Up to 40% of S. pneumoniae may be antibiotic resistant (DRSP), although it has been difficult to document an impact of relatively low level in vitro resistance on outcomes when usual therapies are used (44). It is important to note that if any antibiotic has been used in the three months preceding CAP due to pneumococcus, the organism is more likely to be resistant to an agent that was recently used (45). In addition to recent antibiotic therapy, another risk for DRSP is exposure to a child in daycare, a potentially common risk for women who are pregnant, so that this organism should be considered in all pregnant women (44). Community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) are not being reported commonly, but may cause serious forms of CAP following influenza infection (46). The organism can lead to a severe, bilateral necrotizing infection due to the production of a variety of toxins, including the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). While this organism most commonly leads to skin and soft tissue infection, there is one case report of a severe necrotizing pneumonia due to CA-MRSA which seeded the lung, 9 days post-partum, from septic pelvic thrombophlebitis as a consequence of an infected episiotomy site (47).",

            "text": "Most women with pneumonia do not have multilobar illness, but when present it correlates with a greater risk for a complicated course of illness (18). There are many different methods used to define severity of illness in patients with CAP, but the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) is most widely used in the United States to help define the need for inpatient care and the need for ICU care (49). The PSI uses an assessment of patient age, comorbidity, and laboratory and clinical data to define a patient\u2019s risk of death, with scores leading to categorization into one of five groups, each with increasing mortality risk. In its original derivation, pregnant patients were omitted, but Shariatzadeh and Marrie have observed that all pregnant patients that they evaluated fell into the low risk classes I and II, similar to age-matched controls (15). However, twice as many pregnant patients were hospitalized as age-matched controls with similar PSI scores, yet they had a shorter length of stay. Thus, the PSI may either underestimate the need for inpatient care in pregnancy, or else physicians were being more cautious with admitting pregnant women, even if there was a relatively low mortality risk from pneumonia. The limits of the PSI were suggested in the study by Yost et al., with the finding that the use of the PSI would have recommended that two thirds of admitted pregnant CAP patients could have been sent home, but if this had been done, 10/79 would likely have required later readmission because of a complicated course (18). The limitations of scoring systems such as the pneumonia severity index and the APACHE score in pregnancy include the fact that some of the physiologic changes occurring in pregnancy may alter the scoring system. For instance, physiologic anemia with hematocrit as low as 30 are normally seen in pregnancy. The white cell count may be physiologically elevated in pregnancy as well and numbers as high as 14,000\u201315,000 may be seen. Other changes include a lower creatinine in pregnancy with a normal range being 0.5\u20130.7. Therefore, while a creatinine of 1.0 may be normal in the non-pregnant population, it is clearly an abnormal value in pregnancy and may contribute to inaccurate scoring.",

Based on the expected organisms in pregnant women with CAP, therapy should be directed at Streptococcus pneumoniae (including DRSP in patients with recent antibiotic therapy, underlying chronic heart or lung disease, and those with exposure to a child in daycare), H. influenzae (especially in cigarette smokers), and the \u201catypical\u201d pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella\npneumophila (the latter in the setting of severe CAP). In choosing an antibiotic for bacterial pneumonia, the safety of the agent in pregnancy must be considered, along with its efficacy. Pencillins, cephalosporins, and erythromycin are all safe and potentially effective antimicrobials for CAP (50). Clindamycin is probably also safe, but there is limited clinical experience with this agent (51). The fluoroquinolones are commonly used to treat CAP in non-pregnant patients, but should not be used during pregnancy. They pose a theoretic risk of arthropathy, malformations, and can be both mutagens and carcinogens, although sporadic reports of safe use in pregnancy have appeared, suggesting that they can be used if absolutely necessary (52). Other drugs to be avoided in pregnancy include tetracyclines (the mother is at risk for fulminant hepatitis and these agents can stain and deform fetal teeth and cause bony deformities), chloramphenicol (can cause bone marrow suppression in fetus, and if given near term can cause \u201cgray baby syndrome\u201d with gray facies, flaccidity, and cardiovascular collapse), and sulfa compounds (can cause fetal kernicterus) (53). Aminoglycosides should be used only if there is a strong clinical indication of serious gram-negative infection, as there is potential risk of ototoxicity to the fetus. Vancomycin poses a risk to the fetus of fetal nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity and similarly should only be used if absolutely necessary. Linezolid is categorized as pregnancy Category C, and there is limited experience in pregnancy, but it is a protein synthesis inhibitor, so it should also be avoided unless no other alternative therapy is available.",

First identified in 1933, influenza remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality from febrile respiratory illness worldwide (42, 54). Pregnant women are at increased risk for both acquiring influenza, and for developing complications of infection. In one study by Neuzil et al., pregnant women were affected more often than non-pregnant women (42). Influenza also led to hospitalization for acute cardiopulmonary illness more often in women during the third trimester, in those with advanced age, and in those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma (30, 42). Historically, influenza in pregnancy has been associated with higher rate of morbidity and mortality (5). The course of influenza was first reported during the epidemic of 1918 when 1,350 cases in pregnant women who had an influenza-like illness were evaluated, and pneumonia was a complication in 585 (43%) of these cases. In 52% of these patients, pregnancy was interrupted, and there were 308 (23%) maternal deaths. The mortality was highest in the last three months of pregnancy, and increased if influenza was complicated by pneumonia (54). Overall, in the 1918 epidemic, influenza during pregnancy had a 30% maternal mortality, increasing to 50% in the presence of pneumonia (55). Mortality rose in tandem with the duration of pregnancy to a maximum of 61% when influenza was contracted in the ninth month of pregnancy. In the 1957 epidemic, 50% of women of childbearing age who died were pregnant and 10% of all the influenza deaths were among pregnant women (37)\n. However since 1958, pregnancy studies have shown a variable association with an enhanced morbidity and mortality from influenza (55).",

Therapy for these organisms has been discussed above, but antiviral agents should be considered if a viral pneumonia is likely, especially early in the course of illness (2). Anti-viral agents such as amantadine and rimantadine can prevent illness in exposed patients and reduce the duration of symptoms if given within 48 h of the onset of illness. Amantadine is effective against Influenza A and acts by blocking the release of viral nucleic acids and can be used for prophylaxis in high-risk pregnant women or for therapy in complicated cases (3). It has been found to be non-embryotoxic in mice at 25 times the dose used in humans. When used in post partum women, Amantadine is excreted in breast milk and therefore should only be used in the highest risk patient. There is little experience in pregnancy with the newer neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, which can also be effective for treatment and prophylaxis, if started within 48 h of the onset of symptoms.",

In one series all patients with VZ pneumonia had oral mucosal ulcerations (28). Severity of illness may range from asymptomatic radiographic infiltrates to fulminant respiratory failure and acute lung injury (27, 28). Typically chest radiographs reveal interstitial, diffuse miliary or nodular infiltrates that resolve by 14 days unless complicated by acute lung injury and respiratory failure (65). The severity of infiltrates has been described to peak with the height of the skin eruption (66). One late sequela of varicella pneumonia is diffuse pulmonary calcification (62).",

Varicella embryopathy was first described in 1947 by Laforet and Lynch and has since been redefined by a number of authors (69\u201372), but includes limb hypoplasia, skin scarring, central nervous system involvement, and other skeletal lesions. This embryopathy has been reported with infection occurring as late as 26 weeks (69).",

Fetal abnormalities occurred most commonly in the children of women infected between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation than at any other time in pregnancy (73). Fetal anomalies varied from skin lesions to lethal multi-organ system involvement. Because of concern about fetal effects, the use of prophylactic immune globulin is recommended within 96 h of exposure to prevent maternal illness, in women without prior varicella infection (negative IgG titers) or immunization. Importantly the use of VZ immune globulin in a pregnant woman may not eliminate the incidence of embryopathy, but if given before maternal infection develops, it may decrease or attenuate fetal disease (73). Immunoprophylaxis with zoster immune globulin should be given early after close exposure of a seronegative pregnant woman, with the aim of preventing disease in the mother, but not in the fetus. Although expensive, one analysis suggested that the use of this approach is likely to be cost-effective (34). The varicella vaccine, however, is contraindicated in pregnancy because it is a live-attenuated vaccine.",

There were 12 patients who acquired infection in the first trimester leading to one fatal disseminated disease with associated fetal loss. The other 11 had pulmonary infection only and recovered without dissemination, and 10 of the pregnancies were completed successfully. Among five women who were infected in the second trimester, one developed meningitis and one died of disseminated infection. The course was much different for the 11 women who acquired infection in the final trimester. Disseminated infection developed in seven, all of whom died. Other investigators also reported high rates of dissemination and maternal mortality, especially for infection acquired in the third trimester. Stevens (75) reported that 20% of patients with Coccidioidomycosis pneumonia in the third trimester of pregnancy developed disseminated disease, likely as a consequence of the alteration in maternal cell-mediated immunity during late pregnancy (2).",

Therefore, the influenza vaccine is recommended for all women who will be pregnant during influenza season, regardless of gestational age (57). Varicella vaccination is recommended for susceptible women considering pregnancy at 1\u20133 months before pregnancy or post-partum. Vaccination may reduce the risk of congenital varicella syndrome and decrease morbidity from adult complications of varicella. The varicella vaccine is not recommended for use during pregnancy because it is a live-attenuated vaccine (78). The current pneumococcal vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide from the 23 serotypes that cause 85\u201390% of the infections. The vaccine is effective in decreasing the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia and is recommended to women with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, asplenia, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease (44). It may be given during pregnancy in women with the listed risk factors (79). For women with children at home at the time of pregnancy, it may be useful to be sure that the children have received the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, since it can prevent disease in the children, which in turn may reduce the risk of maternal disease and of maternal infection with DRSP.",

Pregnancy can theoretically accelerate the progression of underlying HIV infection-related immune suppression, and respiratory infection can be the AIDS defining illness for some pregnant patients, leading to an increased risk of both maternal and fetal mortality (80). In addition, vertical transmission of HIV infection to the newborn is a serious concern. Antiretroviral therapy may improve CD4+ count, and reduce the risk of respiratory infection, so therapy should be continued during pregnancy.",

In one review of 22 patients with PCP in pregnancy, 59% had respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and mortality was 50% for the mothers, and there were five intrauterine deaths and four neonatal deaths (81). Women with PCP infection should receive therapy with trimethoprim-sulfa (TMP-SMX), along with corticosteroids if hypoxemia is present. These patients should be monitored for preterm labor and at the time of delivery, any woman receiving TMP-SMX or dapsone should have their baby monitored closely for hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus. For HIV infected women, without active PCP, prophylaxis is best done when the CD4+ cell count falls below 200 cells/\u00b5L, using TMP-SMX. Because of the potential teratogenic risk of TMP in the first trimester, consideration should be given to the use of aerosolized pentamidine because of its lack of systemic absorption.",

Beyond the influence of pregnancy induced changes on cell immunity, there are certain physiological changes in pregnancy that both predispose to infection and also make it more difficult for the pregnant women to sustain any type of respiratory infectious insult. Thus pregnant patients require a higher level of surveillance and early intervention, and the prognostic scoring systems used in non-pregnant patients may not apply in pregnancy. Certain types of pneumonias, particularly influenza and aspiration, can be avoided if patients at risk are identified and existing strategies for prevention are applied. The safety of antimicrobial must also be considered when a pregnant patient is being treated for pneumonia.",
