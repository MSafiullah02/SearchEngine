Hence, it is very likely that surgical masks may 37 yield even greater UVC penetration given their larger particle penetration compared to 38 respirators. 1 Furthermore, the addition of a reflective base, flipping of the masks, or the 39 availability of units that allow irradiation of both surfaces of the mask at the same time 40 (Orbitform Mask Sanitizer, Orbitform Medical, Jackson, Michigan) 2 can facilitate adequate 41 irradiation of all surfaces. 42 Although testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 43 has not been done, UVC has documented activity (\u22653-log reduction) against SARS-CoV, Middle 44 East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 5 and H1N1 influenza A virus. 6 This was 45 achieved following irradiation of N95 respirators at a dose of 1 J/cm 2 per side delivered in under 46 3 minutes. 4 For surgical masks, being of a thinner material, it is likely that the required dose and 47 irradiation time is even lower. 48 49",
