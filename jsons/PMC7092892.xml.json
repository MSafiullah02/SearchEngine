The entry of SARS-CoV, as well as other enveloped viruses including Ebola, HIV and Influenza, is mediated by envelope proteins [3], [4]. The SARS-CoV envelope protein consists of S1, which binds to receptor, and S2, which mediates fusion of the viral and target membranes. In the first step of entry, S1 attaches to a target cell receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and the virus enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis [3], [5]. In the endosome, proteolysis by proteases of the cathespin family trigger conformational changes within S2 that are necessary for membrane fusion [6].",

In the presence of the co-solvent TFE, isolated HR2 forms a trimer of parallel helices [14]. On the other hand, under aqueous conditions, isolated HR2 has been shown to be in an equilibrium between extended coil monomer and helical trimer [15], [16].

Briefly, protein expression was achieved by growing Escherichia coli strain SG13009 in the presence of the appropriate plasmid in 1 L of LB media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL of kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C until they reached an OD600 of 0.6. Expression was induced by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG and the culture was grown for an additional 4\u20135 h at 37 \u00b0C. The HIS-PG-HR2 fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction using a Ni2+ fast-flow Sepharose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The protein was then cleaved using TEV protease and run once more over the Ni2+ column to remove His-PG and TEV protease, which also contains a polyhistidine tag, as well as uncut HIS-PG-HR2. The flow-through fraction containing HR2 was then dialyzed extensively against 10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0 and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM3; Amicon, Billerica, MA). The purity and identity of HR2 was confirmed using SDS\u2013PAGE and MALDI\u2013TOF mass spectrometry.",

            "text": "To interpret the effects of pH and ionic strength, it is of interest to consider the structure of the SARS-CoV HR2 trimer [14]. As shown by the electrostatic profile of HR2 in Fig. 2\nA, there are numerous patches of like-charged sidechains in the TFE-stabilized helical trimer. For example, there are four regions of potential charge repulsion: (1) the negatively charged sidechains of D7, D9 and D12; (2) the positively charged sidechains of K25 and R29; (3) the negatively charged sidechains of E26, D28 and E32; (4) and the negatively charged sidechains of E39, D43 and E46. Increasing ionic strength would be expected to reduce the charge repulsion present in the helical form and thus stabilize the helical form with respect to the extended coil form. Furthermore, at pH 5 the acidic groups are expected to be partially protonated, thereby further reducing charge repulsion. Interestingly, in Influenza HA2, a region that connects two heptad repeat domains also exhibits pH-induced helix formation, presumably due to partial protonation of acidic sidechains and the reduction of electrostatic repulsion in the helical conformation [19]. In the case of the Influenza virus, the formation of helix in this region triggers a large conformational change in HA2 structure that is intrinsic to the viral entry mechanism in the endosome [19], [20]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the SARS-CoV HR2 has evolved to favor the transition from coil to helix in the endosome.",

            "text": "We have previously presented a model for SARS-CoV entry in which the coil\u2013helix equilibrium of HR2 played a role in allowing repositioning of the HR1 and HR2, based on biochemical and biophysical studies at pH 7 [15]. In light of the present results at pH 5, the model needs to be modified. In the modified model, at pH 7 HR2 is in equilibrium between extended coil and helix with the extended coil being favored (Fig. 2B). Upon entering the endosome (i.e. a transition to pH 5) the helix conformation of HR2 is greatly favored. Subsequently, the HR2 helix interacts with the HR1 helix to form the highly stable six helix bundle, which brings the viral and endosomal membranes into close proximity and allows membrane fusion to occur. As a consequence of this model, isolated HR2 helix is transiently present in the endosome, which therefore may present a novel target for therapeutic intervention. For example, small molecules or peptides that bind to the HR2 helix may be expected to disrupt the HR1\u2013HR2 interaction that is critical for membrane fusion. Finally, we note that it will be interesting to consider whether pH-induced structural changes occur the HR2 of other viruses that enter via endocytosis such as Ebola and Influenza.",
