Previous studies have shown no difference in bronchodilatory effect of various ventilator settings, such as flow rate, tidal volume (VT) or ventilatory mode (pressure-versus volume-controlled mechanical ventilation). However, the effectiveness of bronchodilators delivered by MDI and a spacer during assisted ventilation has been studied only in experimental models, where bronchodilator delivery was found to be significantly lower during controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) than during simulated spontaneous breaths of a similar VT. To verify these findings in a clinical setting, the effect of two different vetilatory modes on the bronchodilation induced by b2-agonists delivered by MDI and a spacer in a group of mechanically ventilated patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was examined.",

Prospective and longitudinal study approved by the hospital ethical committee were performed. P under mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hrs in the ICU were included The two exlusion criteria were intracraneal pathology and malignant hyperthermia Demographic data simplified acute physiological score (SAPS),s time length Ramsay score (RS)percent of inhaled anesthesic qualiti and time to wakeup were recorded All of the patients were respiratory and haemodynanamically monitored Fluids inotropics and vasoactive amines were used for haemodynamic stability Respiratory supportwas achieved improving MV parameters ALL patients received 2 mcg/kg/hr fentanyl analgesia.Ventilator in its inspiratory flow branch with 1litter of O2 flow was used RESULTS. eigth male (67%)and 4 female(33%)with a mean age of 61\u00b118yearsand initial SAPS of 16\u00b13 were included.Sevo concentration varied betwen 0.9\u00b10.8 and 1.5\u00b11.3%.Initial an final RS mode were 4and 5.Total S time was 70\u00b134 hrs. The wakeup time defined as the time elapsed for open eyes once sevo was stopped was 17\u00b118 min. One p die after the first 24 hr due mesentheric trhombosis.Another P presented agitation after suspension of sevo. Sevo administration dose not modified hepatic or renal functions. Intrapulmonary shunt started in 28.6% and finished in 19.4% CONCLUSION. Sevo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodinamics allows its administration in IC P without detrment in haemodynamic,respiratory,hepatic and renal functions.P present an adecuate grade of S and rapid wakeup time.We conclude that sevo is usefull in short term and medium term S in P under MV.",

Occlusions, lasting 2 seconds, were performed at different inspiratory volumes (25 ml steps) in random order, along tidal volume range. Immediately after the occlusion P aw equals the alveolar pressure (P alv ). Further changes in P aw are due to patient's respiratory effort; finally the patient relaxes his muscles and a plateau is seen on the P aw trace, representing elastic recoil of respiratory system. The difference between P alv at the time of occlusion and plateau represent the pressure generated by the inspiratory muscles (P mus ). However, since the occlusion gives raise to a noise in the signal for a period of 50-100 ms, the value of P alv at the time of occlusion must be back extrapolated from the most linear portion of P aw after the noise ceases. A mean of 31.6 occlusions for subject were performed, for a total of 411 occlusions. In each patient PTP occl was computed as the area under the time course of P mus,occl .

To analyse the performance of the ICU and to benchmark it with other ICUs could be an experience of great value METHODS. We register, in a daily basis, variation of the data studied, the mean value, the mean value of benchmarking (the same subject in 7 other ICUs),control graphics (with upper limit and lower limit of control covering a confidence interval of 99,7%);these information is in a ICU computer covering a period of 16 weeks; each three months we receive a report with more complete analyses and after 12 months there are a special report with consolidated information. The data are divided in management, clinical and risk indicators. Each group of indicators are composed of some data; for example risk indicators are composed of rate of patients with some infection, rate of accidental extubation, rate of pneumothorax by barotraumas, rate of pneumothorax by venous puncture, rate of pressure ulcers. The system has confidentiality, you only know your data and the benchmarking, but no the data from one specific ICU. The databank is domain of AMIB (the Brazilian Society of Intensive Medicine).We start using the QuaTI at the final of year 2001.There are 30 ICUs in the system at end of year 2002 RESULTS. We compare the performance of our ICU with ourselves along the time, each three months, each year and with data from benchmarking ICUs. With this information we have to know our comparative performance and we can decide if it's necessary to change some process in real and comparative basis CONCLUSION. The study of the performance of one ICU is difficult, complex and expensive. The better way to know one specific performance is to compare it with similar ICUs that have similar resources and case-mix. To compare a Brazilian with European or American ICU is not ideal and could give equivocal information that generates erroneous decisions. With QuaTI, we start a very interesting project that will create a Brazilian databank on ICU performance",

We noticed a proportional increase in both markers associated to the severity of cardiac dysfunction (BNP: 338 +/-345 pg/ml in group 1, 775 +/-375 pg/ml in group 2, 1063 +/-425 pg/ml in group 3, p<0,01; NT-proBNP: 1729 +/-1503 pg/ml in group 1, 7186 +/-3503 pg/ml in group 2, 58922 +/-74184 pg/ml in group 3, p<0,001). To detect cardiac abnormalities in patients with shock, sensibility (Se) of BNP levels higher than 163 pg/ml was of 93% and specificity (Sp) of 57%, with a positive predicting value (PPV) of 81% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 80% (AUC of 0,85). For a NT-proBNP level > 3669 pg/ml we found Se=92%, Sp=100%, PPV=100% and NPV= 88% (AUC of 0,97). Finally, in a patient admitted for shock a BNP level = 889 pg/ml allows to diagnose cardiogenic shock with a Se of 86%, Sp of 86%, PPV of 75% and NPV of 92% (AUC of 0,82), a NT-proBNP level =16541 pg/ml had a Se=86%, Sp=100%, PPV= 100% and NPV= 93% (AUC of 0,90).",

Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheters (PICC) are increasingly used in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Malpositioning of the PICC occurs in up to 20% of cases. Spontaneous correction of malpositioned PICC may be due to the volume of blood flowing through a large vein(1).METHODS.We prospectively studied the malpositioning of PICC and its spontaneous correction fromFeb, 2002 to Feb, 2003. Malpositioned PICC were treated as peripheral lines. Repeat X-ray were done within 24 hrs of the insertion to detect spontaneous correction.RESULTS.Over our study period, we had 4 malpositioned PICC ( 8.7%). Case 1:( A 24 wks gestation infant). A Vygon catheter was inserted 13 cm in Rt. Basilic Vein with good blood return. The PICC was in the Internal Jugular Vein. IV rate was 6 ml/hr. X-ray, 24 hrs later showed that the catheter was in the SVC. Case 2: A baby girl born at 27 wks gestation. A Vygon catheter was inserted 10 cm in the Temporal vein with good blood return. X-ray showed the PICC coiled in Rt. Subclavian vein. IV rate was 6 ml/hr. 12 hrs later the catheter tip was in the Right Atrium. Case 3: A baby boy born at 29 wks gestation. A Vygon catheter was inserted 7 cm through the Rt. Axillary vein with good blood return. X-ray showed the catheter in Rt. Internal Jugular vein. IV rate was 5.3 ml/hr. A day later the catheter tip was in the Rt. Atrium. Case 4: A term infant, birth wt. 2450 gm, had Esophageal Atresia. A Vygon catheter was inserted 8 cm in the Rt. External Jugular vein, with good blood return. X-ray showed the tip in the Rt. Submandibular vein. IV rate was 16 ml/hr. A day later the catheter was in the SVC.CONCLUSION.Our 4 cases of malpositioned PICC, spontaneously corrected. They include 3 cases where the catheters were malpositioned in large veins. The catheter tip of our 4th case was malpositioned in the Submanedibular vein, yet it spontaneously corrected. We propose that: A) Spontaneous correction of malpositioned PICC is due to the combined effect of blood flow through the vein and flow of infused fluids through the catheter.

The accuracy of the transpulmonary method to detect large increments in extravascular lung water (EVLW) is very high in normal lung and somewhat less so in oedematous lung (1). However, it may be more clinically relevant to measure small EVLW variations, for which other diagnostic measures such as chest X-ray are of little utility. Objective: to analyze the accuracy of the transpulmonary thermodilution method to detect small increases in EVLW METHODS. Eleven EVLW determinations were performed by transpulmonary thermodilution (PICCO\u00ae) in four pigs weighing 29-32 Kg before and after the intratracheal introduction of 50 ml of saline serum. Six determinations were performed in normal lung and five in oedematous lung.",

Twelve patients were discharged home and resumed well. Mortality in the whole group of BS was 0.6%.CONCLUSION. In our sample, severe complications occurred in a small subset of patients. Most of them succeeded well despite difficulties in handling heavy patients, intrinsic high mortality rates and a heterogeneous group of surgeons.",

Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheotomy was already described by Ciaglia in 1985 but is not the standard method for performing a tracheostomy in the Netherlands. This method, however, has many advantages compared to the Surgical Conventional Tracheotomy (SCT), which takes usually more than 30 minutes. Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheotomy is an easy procedure, which can also be performed by other clinicians than surgeons. It is easily performed at the bed-side and causes less bleeding. In 1999 this technique was modified in order to simplify the procedure with concurrent decrease in operating time and complications. The objective of this study is to document the time required to perform a modified Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheotomy (mPDT) and complications associated with the procedure.",

In 5 patients superficial bleeding occurred, which could be managed by temporary compression, and in one patient mediastinal emphysema was seen. In only one patient the procedure needed to be converted into an open tracheotomy due to a bleeding venous plexus. No late complications were encountered. Procedure-related mortality was 0%.
