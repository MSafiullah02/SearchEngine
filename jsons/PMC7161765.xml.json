However, reliable coupling of antigen and danger signals in a virus\u2010like fashion remains challenging at the nanoscale as the task demands stable adjuvant compartmentalization in functionalizable nanocarriers for antigen association. We herein demonstrate a viral capsid\u2010like hollow polymeric nanoparticle encapsulating an emerging class of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist adjuvant as a viromimetic vaccine platform. Consisting of a thin shell of poly(lactic\u2010co\u2010glycolic acid) (PLGA) with a large aqueous core, the hollow nanoparticles stably entrap the soluble adjuvant for antigen conjugation and storage. Owing to the acid\u2010sensitive PLGA hydrolysis, the nanoparticles readily release the adjuvant upon cellular uptake, facilitating immune activation and antigen recognition. To our knowledge, the present work is the first report of a PLGA\u2010based hollow nanocarrier capable of adjustable encapsulation and controlled release of STING agonists for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, STING is a potent inducer of type I interferons (IFNs) typically activated upon intracellular infection.5 Following stimulation by cytosolic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), STING activates IRF3 and NF\u03baB, which in turn upregulate the expression of type I IFNs and other pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines to shape the adaptive immunity.[qv: 5b,6] The well\u2010defined immune activation mechanism of CDNs has made them a desirable adjuvant candidate for improving vaccine potency. However, free CDNs are not readily membrane\u2010permeable, and their systemic distribution may trigger undesirable reactogenic effects.7 In addition, given that type I IFNs are pleiotropic and can undermine immune responses upon out\u2010of\u2010sequence antigen presentation,8 CDN delivery is preferably synchronized with target antigens for optimal immune potentiation. While multiple formulations have been prepared for CDN delivery,9 their shortcomings ranging from poor encapsulation efficiency, size limitation, and carrier instability leave much room for carrier improvement. In light of these considerations, we demonstrated that the hollow polymeric nanoparticles can encapsulate tunable levels of cdGMP at a high efficiency and improve the compound's potency and safety. Surface functionalization of the nanoparticles was mediated by incorporation of DSPE\u2010PEG\u2010maleimide in the polymeric shell, which allowed for further antigen conjugation for vaccine preparations (Figure\n\n1\nA). In the present study, a vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was prepared based on the viromimetic design.",

The \u03b2\u2010coronavirus is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), with dromedary camels as the primary reservoir host for human infection.11 Currently, no effective therapeutic or prophylactic measure is available against the disease, and MERS\u2010CoV vaccine development remains a global health priority identified by the World Health Organization (WHO). While several virus\u2010based vaccines have been explored,12 major efforts on MERS\u2010CoV vaccine research are devoted to subunit candidates such as MERS\u2010CoV spike protein and its derivatives, S1 protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) for safety and logistical considerations.13 Ongoing challenges remain, however, as observation of vaccination\u2010induced pulmonary immunopathology in immunized and challenged hosts raises concerns over the use of traditional, Th2\u2010dominant adjuvants.14 In addition, with cellular immunity being an increasingly recognized component alongside neutralizing antibodies for durable protection against the mutation\u2010prone virus,15 MERS\u2010CoV vaccines may benefit from technologies that can effectively promote both humoral and cellular immune responses.",

The RBD antigen\u2010coated nanoparticles possess a virus\u2010like morphology and can coordinately deliver both antigen and adjuvant in vitro and in vivo. In comparison to formulations that contain soluble antigens and adjuvants, inoculation with the nanoparticle (NP)\u2010based vaccine induced greatly enhanced antigen\u2010specific humoral and cellular responses in immunized mice. We further demonstrated that immunization with this NP\u2010based MERS\u2010CoV vaccine confers the protection against lethal MERS\u2010CoV challenges in highly MERS\u2010CoV\u2010permissive transgenic mice globally expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a functional MERS\u2010CoV receptor.

Characterizations by cryo\u2010EM and the dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that the hollow nanoparticles had a shell thickness of \u224810 nm and a unimodal particle distribution with an average diameter of 114.0 nm (Figure 1B\u2013D). A large aqueous interior could be observed, and successful encapsulation of cdGMP was verified by HPLC (Figure 1E). On the other hand, no peak of nanoparticle\u2010associated cdGMP was detected after directly mixing hollow nanoparticles with cdGMP, indicating there is no interaction between the nanoparticle and the adjuvant (Figure S1, Supporting Information). With different cdGMP input, loading efficiency was consistent at approximately 48% (Figure 1F). This result indicates consistent partitioning of cdGMP solutions inside the hollow nanoparticles regardless of cdGMP concentration, thereby enabling controllable adjuvant loading for vaccine development. The cdGMP\u2010loaded nanoparticles (NP(cdGMP)) are highly robust as little adjuvant release was observed over an extended period of time upon storage in enclosed Eppendorf tubes at 4 \u00b0C and room temperature (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In a dialysis experiment at 37 \u00b0C, (NP(cdGMP)) slowly released the adjuvant in a sustained manner at pH 7.4 but had a burst release profile at pH 5. This pH\u2010sensitive release kinetics could be attributed to the acid\u2010labile ester hydrolysis of PLGA under acidic conditions (Figure 1G). The release profile is favorable for vaccine delivery as the nanoparticles can retain their content upon administration and unload their cargoes once entering the acidic endolysosomal compartment following cellular uptake.",

Unlike these previously reported formulations, a double\u2010emulsion process is adopted in the present work to facilitate the incorporation of water\u2010soluble, nonionizable compounds. Upon adjusting the double emulsion parameters, we observed that the molecular weight of the polymer is critical to the hollow nanostructure formation. Preparations with 40 000 Da PLGA yielded solid particles or particles with miniscule aqueous interior as observed under cryoEM (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which are consistent with prior reports on double\u2010emulsion\u2010based PLGA nanoparticles.18 These particles had poor cdGMP loading, which is also in agreement with previous, unsuccessful efforts on emulsion\u2010based STING agonist encapsulation[qv: 9b] and reflect the long\u2010standing challenge in nanoencapsulation of nonlipophilic compounds.19 Successful preparation of the capsid\u2010like hollow nanoparticles was made possible with the 10 000 Da polymer, which exhibits significantly lower viscosity in organic solvent as compared to the high\u2010molecular\u2010weight polymer (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Given the correlation between solution viscosity and surface tension,20 it can be reasoned that double emulsions with the low\u2010molecular\u2010weight polymer solution had reduced interfacial surface tensions, thereby contributing to more stable core\u2013shell structures and highly efficient incorporation of the cdGMP solution.",

The particular formulation contained approximately 1000 cdGMP molecules per particle as calculated with particle numbers measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (\u22481012 particles per 1 mg of polymer). To assess the immune potentiating functionality of the nanoparticulate STING agonists, we first compared cdGMP and NP(cdGMP) in in vitro studies with murine dendritic cell (DC)\u2010like JAWS II cells. JAWS II cells have been widely used in immunological studies due to their ease of preparation compared to primary dendritic cells.21 Though slightly less responsive, JAWS II cells exhibit similar phenotypic markers and functions to bone marrow\u2010derived dendritic cells (BMDCs).22 Using a fluorescently labeled cdGMP, we noted that the cellular uptake of water soluble STING agonist was greatly increased when it was encapsulated in the hollow nanoparticles (Figure\n\n2\nA), concomitant with an increase in the induction of cytokines, including IFN\u2010\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20106 (Figure 2B). The capability of cdGMP and NP(cdGMP) in inducing DC maturation was further confirmed by examining the upregulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, on BMDCs. At an equivalent adjuvant dosage (1 \u00b5g mL\u22121), NP(cdGMP) significantly enhanced CD80 expression on BMDCs compared to free cdGMP (Figure 2C). These data indicate that the NP(cdGMP) is superior to free cdGMP in triggering host immune responses, in part, due to its more efficient uptake by professional antigen\u2010presenting cells.",

The polydispersity index (PDI) remained constant before and after protein conjugation, with a mean at 0.153 and 0.152, respectively (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Quantification by BCA assay showed that RBD\u2010conjugated nanoparticles (RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP)) contained \u224870% of the antigen input, or \u224811.2 \u00b5g of RBD per mg of PLGA. With approximately 1 \u00d7 1012 particles per mg of PLGA, this corresponds to \u2248250 protein antigens per particle (Figure 3D and Figure S3, Supporting Information). Cryo\u2010EM images further revealed that the hollow particulate structure remained intact following protein conjugation (Figure 3E). It should be noted that the nanoparticles appeared solid in structure upon negative staining under TEM, in which uranyl acetate was precluded from entering the inner core, indicating the structural integrity of the polymeric shell (Figure 3F). Through immunogold staining, the presence of RBD antigens on the viromimetic nanoparticles was further confirmed (Figure 3G). We also observed that the protein conjugation process had little influence on the encapsulated adjuvant content (Figure 3H), which highlighted the particle's stability for surface functionalization.",

Following 24 h of incubation with JAWS II cells, prominent antigen and adjuvant fluorescence signals were observed intracellularly (Figure\n\n4\nA).

We further examined the distribution of RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) following subcutaneous administration in mice. One hour after the nanoparticle injection, colocalized antigen and adjuvant signals were observed in the draining lymph node.

Following a prime\u2010boost vaccination on day 0 and day 21, sera were collected over a span of 300 d for ELISA analysis. Compared to other groups, RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) induced significantly higher titers of antigen\u2010specific antibodies that reached a peak two weeks postboosting and sustained for 300 d (Figure\n\n5\nA). Notably, IgG subtype analysis on the sera collected on day 35 at the peak of the antibody response showed high levels of RBD\u2010specific IgG2a antibodies in mice immunized with the nanoparticle vaccine, exhibiting a balanced Th1 and Th2 response (Figure 5B). In contrast, free MF59 and cdGMP\u2010adjuvanted RBD antigens induced weak IgG1 responses and very limited levels of IgG2a. As Th1\u2010associated responses and durable antibody titers are likely attributed to the help of CD4+ T cell, we next investigated RBD\u2010specific CD4+ T cell responses elicited by different vaccine formulations. T cell responses at the acute phase were first determined seven days after the booster vaccination by restimulating harvested splenocytes with purified RBD antigens.25 Following intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis, RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP)\u2010inoculated group showed the highest frequency of IFN\u03b3+ subset that corresponds to functional, antigen\u2010specific CD4+ T cells (Figure 5C). Moreover, on week 6 postboosting after the transition of effector cells into stable memory populations,25 CD4+ T cells with the central memory phenotype (CD44+CD62L+) were also significantly elevated in the draining lymph nodes of RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP)\u2010immunized mice (Figure 5E). The antigen\u2010specific CD4+ T cell as well as the expanded central memory population elicited by the viromimetic nanoparticles can be thus associated with the augmented induction of anti\u2010MERS\u2010CoV RBD antibodies, particularly the Th1\u2010associated IgG2a.",

Briefly, aliquots of RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C and transported overseas for assessment in human DPP4\u2010transgenic mice. Upon validating that the nanoparticles retained their expected size, surface antigens, and adjuvant encapsulants following a 2\u2010month storage period (Figure S4, Supporting Information), both RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) and NP(cdGMP), which is without conjugated RBD, were administered subcutaneously to the transgenic mice on day 0 and day 28 (Figure\n\n7\nA). Four weeks after the second immunization, sera were collected for determining the neutralizing antibody titers against live MERS\u2010CoV using a Vero E6 cell\u2010based microneutralization assay. Compared to the undetectable antibody response of the control NP\u2010immunized animals, an average 100% neutralization titer (NT100) of 128, ranging from 40 to 320 could be readily detected in each mouse immunized with RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) (Figure 7B and Table S1, Supporting Information). Following intranasal challenge with 100 LD50 (\u2248103 TCID50) of MERS\u2010CoV EMC/2012 strain, two mice from each group were euthanized at 2 d postinfection (dpi) for assessing the viral loads and the histopathology of the lungs, whereas the remaining mice were monitored daily for the mortality until 24 dpi. As safety concerns of vaccination\u2010induced immunopathology have been raised in MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV infection models with whole inactivated virus (WIV), recombinant DNA\u2010based, and even modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccines,28 we thoroughly examined the pathological changes of lung specimens of challenged mice. Although no any eosinophilic infiltration could be readily observed in either group (Figure 7C and Figure S5, Supporting Information), mice immunized with RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) exhibited a mild infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes as compared to the control nanoparticles (Figure 7C and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, blue arrows). While the exact nature of eosinophil\u2010free inflammatory responses warrants further investigations, we speculate that the enhanced Th1 responses afforded by the nanoparticle vaccine might be accountable.29 Given the potent antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses induced by the RBD\u2010NP(cdGMP) and the high viral titer used for the animal challenge, it is likely that the lymphocytic infiltration corresponded to local recruitment of vaccine\u2010induced lymphocytes. The presence of such local lymphocytes has been reported to contribute to protective immunity against the respiratory virus.30\n",

However, administration of these adjuvanted formulations needs to be handled with caution as the elevated levels of immunogenicity usually come at the cost of increased systemic inflammatory responses and reactogenicity. The safety concern regarding adjuvant reactogenicity has motivated ongoing development of particulate adjuvant formulations,35 which have been designed to target the lymphatic system to better promote localized immune responses. For the CDN\u2010based, STING agonist adjuvant adopted in the present study, several vehicles, including liposomes,[qv: 9a,36] calcium phosphate nanoparticles,37 polymeric microparticles,38 and cationic polymers,39 have been applied to improve the molecule's potency and safety in prior reports. Compared to the aforementioned STING agonist formulations, the hollow polymeric nanoparticle developed herein possesses the combined advantages of biocompatibility, size consistency, colloidal stability, tunable adjuvant loading, pH\u2010responsive release, and antigen functionalizability. These favorable attributes make the hollow nanoparticles a desirable delivery platform for STING\u2010mediated immune modulation. Examination of the NP(cdGMP) showed many of the reported advantages of nanoparticulate adjuvants, including efficient uptake by antigen presenting cells, enhanced immunostimulating capability, and reduced systemic inflammatory responses. These attributes are expected to improve the immunogenicity, efficacy, safety, and applicability of STING agonists for MERS\u2010CoV and other vaccination purposes. In addition, recombinant viral antigens can be attached to these adjuvant\u2010loaded nanoparticles, enabling mimicry of natural virions for effective immune potentiation and induction of protective immune responses.40\n",

The data indicate that this viromimetic nanoparticulate vaccine was superior in its ability to mount humoral responses when compared to MF59, the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art adjuvant for influenza vaccine. The antibody generated by the vaccine is capable of neutralizing to MERS\u2010CoV and directly contributes to the protective immunity against viral challenges. Moreover, the nanoparticle vaccine induced a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response, which is consistent with prior reports of STING\u2010agonist\u2010mediated immune stimulation.[qv: 5a,6a,45] The potent Th1 response as indicated by the high levels of IgG2a antibodies likely accounted for the absence of eosinophilic immunopathology. Notably, our nanoparticle vaccines are highly capable of priming both antigen\u2010specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. While there is a yet\u2010to\u2010be\u2010consensus thought that the recovery of MERS\u2010CoV infection may not solely correlate with antibody responses, recent literature is showing increasing emphasis on the role of T cell responses, especially CD8+ T cells, in protective immunity against MERS\u2010CoV.15 Future studies further dissecting humoral and cellular immune responses in MERS\u2010CoV protection are warranted.",

These undesirable host responses are characterized by enhanced pulmonary eosinophilic and monocytic infiltration, accompanied by an increased recruitment of complement protein C3a without any sign of uncontrollable viral infection.46 It was noted that passive transfer of sera that contain MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific but non\u2010neutralizing antibodies derived from infected or a full\u2010length S protein\u2010immunized rabbits to na\u00efve rabbits resulted in exacerbated pulmonary inflammation, further accentuating the safety concern over suboptimal host responses to infection and/or immunization.47 It has also been observed that live MERS\u2010CoV challenge of highly permissive human DPP4 transgenic mice immunized with either alum\u2010 or MF59\u2010formulated WIV uniformly caused significant increases in Th2\u2010skewed eosinophilic infiltration within the lungs.14 Recently, we noted human DPP4 transgenic mice immunized with recombinant adenovirus Ad5\u2010encoding S1 (rASd5\u2010S1) exhibited varying extents of perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs upon challenge despite its impressive immunogenicity and efficacy against the lethality of MERS\u2010CoV.48 In this study, the prototype nanoparticle\u2010based MERS vaccine is not only immunogenic and effective in inhibiting viral infection, but also obviates the induction of undesirable lung pathology in immunized and challenged human DPP4 transgenic mice. These encouraging results warrant further development of the nanoparticle\u2010based vaccine platform.",

While live microbes have long provided design inspirations for vaccine engineering,49 the present work further advances the pathogen\u2010mimicking concept with the STING agonist\u2010loaded, capsid\u2010like hollow nanoparticles. Unlike most prior reports of PLGA\u2010based nanoformulations that have inadequate encapsulation capacity for water\u2010soluble compounds, the hollow PLGA nanoparticles presently herein permit tunable encapsulation and controlled release of water\u2010soluble STING agonists. The cargo of the nanoparticles may be further adjusted to modulate immune stimulation, and the particles' functionalizability allows for attachment of different recombinant viral antigens to tailor to specific vaccination needs. Consisting entirely of biocompatible materials, the nanoparticles are safe to administer, and they can be stored and transported upon freezing. Although the need for cold chain transportation would incur additional cost, we anticipate the public health benefit to outweigh the technological and logistical investment. Toward future translation, scalable manufacturing is expected to benefit from existing infrastructures for recombinant protein production and polymeric nanoformulations.50 By effectively coupling viral antigens with immunologic adjuvants, nanoparticle vaccines with minimal safety concerns and potency rivaling viral vector\u2010based formulations can be envisioned.",

For the proof\u2010of\u2010principle study, two groups of five age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched human DPP4\u2010transgenic mice were immunized subcutaneously twice, four weeks apart, with either the MERS\u2010CoV RBD nanoparticle vaccine or control nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were thawed in a 37 \u00b0C water bath from samples that were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for 2 months. Four weeks after the booster, mice were bled for assessing MERS\u2010CoV RBD\u2010specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses prior to intranasal (i.n.) challenge with 100 LD50 (50% lethal dose) (\u2248103 TCID50) of MERS\u2010CoV (EMC/2012 strain). Virally challenged mice were monitored daily for clinical manifestations (i.e., weight loss) and mortality for at least 24 d after infection. Two of the five mice were sacrificed on day 2 postchallenge to assess the lung viral loads by Vero E6\u2010based infection assay and quantitative PCR as previously described.55 In addition, the lung tissues were processed, paraffin\u2010embedded, and hematoxylin\u2010and\u2010eosin (H&E)\u2010stained for assessing the histopathology, as previously described.56\n",
