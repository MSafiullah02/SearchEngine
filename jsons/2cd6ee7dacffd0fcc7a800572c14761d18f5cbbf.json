            "text": "After some patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the Infectious Disease Department of L. Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy, complained of olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs), we performed a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of these alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 19 March 2020, a simple questionnaire including questions about the presence or absence of OTDs, their type and time of onset respective to hospitalization were submitted through verbal interview to all SARS-CoV-2positive hospitalized patients who were able to give informed consent. Of 88 hospitalized patients, 59 were able to be interviewed (29 were nonrespondents, of whom 4 had dementia, 2 had a linguistic barrier, and 23 were on noninvasive ventilation) ( Table 1) . Of these, 20 (33.9%) reported at least 1 taste or olfactory disorder and 11 (18.6%) both. Twelve patients (20.3%) presented the symptoms before the hospital admission, whereas 8 (13.5%) experienced the symptoms during the hospital stay. Taste alterations were more frequently (91%) before hospitalization, whereas after hospitalization taste and olfactory alteration appeared with equal frequency. Females reported OTDs more frequently than males Olfactory and taste disorders are well known to be related with a wide range of viral infections [4, 5] . SARS-CoV has demonstrated in a mice model a transneural penetration through the olfactory bulb [6] . Moreover, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor, which is used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind and penetrate into the cell, is widely expressed on the epithelial cells of the mucosa of the oral cavity [7] . These findings could explain the underlying pathogenetic mechanism of taste and olfactory disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
