In particular, the age profile of susceptibility and infectivity, the frequency of super-spreading events, the amount of transmission in the household, and the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to transmission remain debated. The study by Qifang Bi and colleagues1 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases explores some of these questions by analysing detailed contact tracing data from Shenzhen, a large and affluent city in southern China at the border with Hong Kong. To dissect the drivers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, the authors modelled PCR-confirmed infections in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts from Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020.1\n",

Index cases detected by symptom-based surveillance were isolated outside of the home on average 4\u00b76 days (95% CI 4\u00b71\u20135\u00b70) after symptom onset. Furthermore, individuals identified via contact tracing were isolated or quarantined outside of the home on average 2\u00b77 days (95% CI 2\u00b71\u20133\u00b73) after symptom onset.1 Consequently, the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 in Shenzhen (mean estimate 6\u00b73 days; 95% CI 5\u00b72\u20137\u00b76) should be considered a lower bound and would probably increase in less successfully controlled outbreaks.",

In the Shenzhen data, the authors noted no difference in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 from children or adults.1 This is in contrast to pandemic influenza virus, which is more easily transmitted by children. It will be useful to confirm the age profile of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility with data from other locations and serological surveys, which capture more infections than PCR. Age-specific susceptibility, infectivity, and severity are important factors to get right to project the impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and disease burden. School closures exert a substantial economic toll on societies and maintaining these interventions for long periods of time requires robust supportive evidence.",

However, the mean R does not tell the full story. There is evidence of transmission heterogeneity with SARS-CoV-2, with 10% of cases accounting for 90% of transmission.1 Such a high level of heterogeneity is consistent with, if a little more extreme than, that of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and more pronounced than for other directly transmitted respiratory viruses such as measles or influenza.5 Beyond the intensity of contacts, there is no clear factor in the Shenzhen data that could explain the high transmission potential of some infections. Further research into the biological (eg, shedding and symptoms) and social factors (eg, type of contacts and environment) that drive transmission heterogeneity is warranted to guide more targeted interventions against SARS-CoV-2.",

They show that for a given R, the longer the infectious period, the more easily the epidemic can be brought under control with case-based interventions. This is because case isolation reduces the full transmission potential of each case, particularly if the infectious period is long and cases can be isolated 2\u20135 days after symptom onset. Furthermore, Bi and colleagues show that contact-based interventions are more efficient than case-based interventions to reduce transmission, since infected contacts are typically isolated earlier in their infection history than index cases. This worthwhile modelling exercise highlights the urgent need for more information about the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2.",

As a result, the conclusion that case-based or contact-based interventions alone could bring the epidemic under control for longer durations of the infectious period is optimistic, and contrasts with previous simulation studies.6 Viral shedding studies and epidemiological investigations suggest that in the household, around 40% of transmission occurs before symptom onset, the live virus is shed for at least 1 week after symptom onset, and there is high shedding in asymptomatic individuals.7, 8, 9 Crucially, the effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing will depend on the fraction of transmission originating from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.9\n",

Hence new technology-based approaches are greatly needed to assist in identification of contacts, especially if case detection is aggressive.9 Building on the SARS-CoV-2 experience in Shenzhen and other settings, we contend that enhanced case finding and contact tracing should be part of the long-term response to this pandemic\u2014this can get us most of the way towards control.9\n",
