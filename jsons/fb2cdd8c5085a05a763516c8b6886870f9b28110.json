Girichev, Molecular structure and electron distribution of 4-nitropyridine N-oxide: Experimental and theoretical study of substituent effects, Journal of Molecular Structure (2020), doi: https://doi.Abstract The molecular structure of 4-nitropyridine N-oxide, 4-NO 2 -PyO, has been determined by gas-phase electron diffraction monitored by mass spectrometry (GED/MS) and by quantum chemical calculations (DFT and MP2). Comparison of these results with those for non-substituted pyridine N-oxide and 4-methylpyridine N-oxide CH 3 -PyO, demonstrate strong substitution effects on structural parameters and electron density distribution. The presence of the electronwithdrawing -NO 2 group in para-position of 4-NO 2 -PyO results in an increase of the ipso-angle and a decrease of the semipolar bond length r(N\u2192O) in comparison to the non-substituted PyO.",

Heterocyclic compounds with N-oxide groups have achieved widespread utility foremost because of their pronounced biological activity [1] . In the literature we can find the evidence of bactericidal, analgesic, anticonvulsant, apoptotic, and antimicrobial activity of N-oxides [2, 3] . These properties allow to use N-oxides as inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [4, 5] , as antiviral agent against various SARS corona virus strains [6] , and as antiadhesive and quorum-sensitive inhibitor [7] . Some complexes with pyridine-N-oxides are used in agriculture to regulate plant growth rates [8] . According to numerous studies, the biochemical activity of N-oxides is due to the complexations with the metalloporphyrins in living organisms [9] [10] [11] . Obviously, the reactivity of N-oxides may vary due to different substituents in the ring [12] .",

Now more sophisticated methods for the analysis of GED data are available, including the possibility of quantum chemical results to be used in the interpretation of the experimental data. This allows us to determine the structural parameters more precisely compared to the studies performed in 1982. The experimental structural data for 4-methylpyridine-N-oxide obtained in our study [24] are in a good agreement with the theoretical parameters as well as the experimental X-ray data.",

            "text": "The differences in theoretical values for bond distances do not exceed 0.020 \u00c5, whereas the calculated values of the bond angles are almost equal, independent of the theoretical level. Both, quantum chemistry and GED analysis result in C 2v overall symmetry of the molecule with a planar pyridine ring. The nitro-group is coplanar with the heterocycle plane. Obviously, this position provides a conjugation between the \u03c0-system of the pyridine ring and the NO 2 group. Furthermore, Figure 2 presenting the calculated (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ) -NO 2 -group rotation potential curve clearly shows that changing of the torsional angle \u03c4(C2C1N2O3) by more than for 12\u00b0 leads to a significant increase in energy. M. Dakkouri and V. Typke performed theoretical investigation of the structure of 2-nitropyridine-N-oxide [45] . It is astonishing to note that the endocyclic bond lengths of the pyridine N-oxide ring is almost equal, independent of the position of the nitro group. Table 4 compares the structure of pyridine-N-oxide and its two substituted obtained by GED, X-ray and DFT. Taking into account that the structural parameters obtained by different methods have different physical meaning, we can note a good agreement of the values obtained in our research (therein and [24] ) with the theoretical results (therein and [21] ) and, also, with the parameters for the crystals [46, 47] in contrast to the values recommended by Chiang J. F. et al. [20] . Apparently, some increase of the semipolar N\u2192O bond lengths in a crystal phase compared to the free molecules is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. All parameters presented in Table   4 confirm the hyperconjugation in the pyridine ring and the sp 2 hybridization concept of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the ring. The exceptions are only the data by Chiang J. F. et al. [20] , which are rather strange as we mentioned above. Unfortunately, large uncertainties in GED parameters for PyO [19] do not allow a comparison of the experimental structures. Thus, we can compare only the values obtained in our GED study (therein and [24] ) and the calculated values.",

To study the substituent effect on the aromaticity the nuclear independent chemical shifts NICS(1) have been calculated. NICS(1) values correspond to the negative isotropic shielding (in ppm) at 1 \u00c5 above the ring plane [50] [51] [52] . It is of important to note that in a vast number of papers it has been elaborately shown that (depending on the size of the ring) the in-plane aromaticity which is indicated by the isotropic NICS(0) value contains considerable contribution of in-plane \u03c3aromaticity resulting from the diamagnetic shielding of the \u03c3 electronic framework. Thus the NICS(1) value regards to be a better descriptor of the \u03c0 contribution to aromaticity due to the apparent decrease of the local contributions of the \u03c3 framework at larger distances from the ring center. All NICS values were computed by employing the standard GIAO method implemented in Table 6 ) are in satisfactory agreement with the Wiberg bond indexes ( Table 5 ) and confirm that the bonds in the pyridine ring are neither single nor double.

According to QTAIM results, the atomic charge on the ipso carbon atom C1 in 4-NO 2 -PyO significantly changes in comparison with PyO because of a neighbor to acceptor -NO 2 group. The electron density on C2, C5 and N1 atoms in 4-NO 2 -PyO is decreased also due to negative mesomeric effect which takes place inside the pyridine ring. The total charge q(ring) of the heterocyclic ring in PyO has a positive value +0.274e which is increased up to +0.626e when -NO 2 group has been introduced. Indeed, the electron-withdrawing -NO 2 group is a part of \u03c0-conjugated system of the molecule, and as result electron density is shifted from O1 atom and pyridine ring towards the substituent. The negative total charge of -NO 2 group q(R) has a value -0.529e, that additionally supports the suggestion mentioned above. We would like to point out the magnitude of electron density into pyridine ring is changed quantitatively but topologically electron density distribution does not changed dramatically between non-and substituted pyridine-N-oxides (see Figure 7 and Table 6 ).

The introduction of-NO 2 is accompanied by an increase of \u03c1 b from 0.323 a.u. in PyO to 0.325 a.u. in 4-NO 2 -PyO and of ellipticity value \u03b5 from 0.186 to 0.195 for C1-C2 bond, respectively (see Table 6 ). That leads to magnification of electrostatic repulsion between these bonds and as result the ipso-angle C2C1C5 is changed from 117.7\u00b0 in PyO to 119.9\u00b0 in 4-NO 2 -PyO (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ).It is interesting to note the same tendency is observed for crystal data where the ipso-angle C2C1C5 increased from 117.9\u00b0 to 120.5\u00b0 (see Table 4 ).",

Furthermore, the introduction of various substituents in the pyridine ring may either facilitate the transfer of electron density from oxygen to the heterocycle and reduce the negative charge on the oxygen atom or, contrariwise, increase the negative charge on the oxygen. Thus, the introduction of electron-donating -CH 3 substituent increases the bond length N\u2192O, reduces the correspondent Wiberg bond index and significantly increases the electron density on oxygen. In contrast, the introduction of electron-withdrawing -NO 2 group in the pyridine ring reduces the bond distance r(N\u2192O), increases the Wiberg bond index Q(N\u2192O) and, consequently, makes this bond more rigid and reduces the negative charge on oxygen. Obviously, in this case the presence of strong acceptor -NO 2 group results in a withdrawal of charges from the ring atoms and the N-oxide oxygen.

The calculated values of NICS(1): -7.29 (PyO), -6.95 (4-NO 2 -PyO) and -7.18 (4-Me-PyO) are quite close to each other. Some decrease of NICS(1) for 4-NO 2 -PyO can hardly be considered as noticeable effect of the substituent to the aromaticity.QTAIM analysis To be more accurate in interpretation of changes of structural features from PyO to 4-NO 2 -PyO we have analyzed the topological properties of the electron density for these molecules employing the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) developed by R. Bader [25]. The set of topological properties of \u03c1(r) has been obtained for the molecular wave function of PyO and 4-NO 2 -PyO at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ approach. The molecular graphs and net atomic charges for C 2v structures of PyO and 4-NO 2 -PyO are illustrated in Figure 6. The Laplacian map in the plane of pyridine ring is presented on Figure 7 and shows the regions of local charge depletion (\u2207 2 \u03c1 b > 0) and concentration (\u2207 2 \u03c1 b < 0) in PyO and 4-NO 2 -PyO molecules. The most important topological properties of electron density at the bond critical points (BCP) are summarized in Table 6. It is clear that the charge densities at BCP (\u03c1 b ) are correlated with the correspondent bond distance. The negative values of the Laplacian (\u2207 2 \u03c1 b ) and total electronic energy density (H b ) indicate the occurrence of shared interaction which implies a covalent nature of the chemical bonds for both molecules studied. The values of the electronic delocalization index\u03b4 can be considered as the bond order characteristics. These values (see",

Indeed, the PyO molecules are aggregated into crystal pack mostly due to hydrogen bonds between oxygen atom of semipolar bond N\u2192O and hydrogen atoms in 2-and 6ring positions of neighboring molecules PyO [23]. According to Wang Y. et al. [23] the crystal pack of 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide is formed by parallel layers. Furthermore, the oxygen atom of N\u2192O semipolar bond of one molecule is situated approximately above the center of N-C distance between nitro group and pyridine ring of another molecule, wherein the N\u2026O distance is shorter than the C\u2026O distance (2.99 \u00c5 and 3.06 \u00c5 correspondingly). The reason of layered structure could be an appearance of additional hydrogen bonds due to negatively charged oxygen atoms of -NO 2 group and increased positive charges of the hydrogen atoms in 4-NO 2 -PyO molecule in comparison to pyridine-N-oxide. Such assumption fully corresponds to net atomic charges distribution obtained by QTAM for free PyO and 4-NO 2 -PyO molecules (see Figure 6). The mutual molecules position in crystal can be explained by electrostatic attraction between negatively charged oxygen and positively charged nitrogen and carbon atoms. Moreover according to result of calculations the charge of nitrogen atom in -NO 2 is larger than that for carbon (+0.402e and +0.241e correspondingly), it is the possible explanation for shorter N\u2026O contact in comparison to C\u2026O distance. As we can see the simple electrostatic model which employing the Bader's atomic charges of free 4-NO 2 -PyO molecule allows describing correctly the arrangement of these molecules inside the crystal. Galm\u00e9s B. et al. [54] had attempted to characterize the geometric features of the nitropyridine-1-Oxides complexes employing the molecular electrostatic potential and results of QTAIM. The position of 4-NO 2 -PyO molecules in the crystal pack has been described as interaction between \u0440-hole donor nitro group of one molecule and oxygen atom of N\u2192O semipolar bond of another. Both conceptions work well however the simple electrostatic model of atomic charges seems to be easier for understanding. The most interesting features of the topological analysis of 4-NO 2 -PyO are related to the N1\u2192O1 semipolar bond. Along with the substantially high electron density concentration and rather large value of the electronic delocalization index, the bond ellipticity value is noticeably low. These features confirm that N1\u2192 O1 bond is predominantly covalent and possess the cylindrical symmetry. On the other hand, NBO analysis shows the presence of lone pare LP(O1) interaction with the antibonding \u03c0*(N1-C3) NBO[21] in the pyridine-N-oxide molecules. Apparently, the question about the semipolar N\u2192O bond nature requires further research.",

The total charge of the heterocyclic ring in PyO increases when -NO 2 group has been introduced. Indeed, the electron-withdrawing -NO 2 group is a part of \u03c0-conjugated system of 4-NO 2 -PyO molecule, and as result electron density is shifted towards the substituent. The electron density redistribution with the substituent introduction results foremost in the values of heterocycle ipso-angle. Thus, the presence of the electron-withdrawing -bond appears to be also sensitive to a substituent in para-positon nature. The presence of electron withdrawing -NO 2 group in 4-NO 2 -PyO results in a shortening of r(N\u2192O) in comparison with PyO, the corresponding bond order increases, and the negative net charge on the oxygen atom decreases, while in 4-Me-PyO with the donor substituent all changes are opposite. Furthermore, the semipolar N1\u2192O1 bond reveals very interesting properties. According to QTAIM N1\u2192O1 semipolar bond is predominantly covalent and possess the cylindrical symmetry. At the same time the electron density concentration is substantially high in comparison with the values for all bonds in heterocycle and the value of the electronic delocalization index for N1\u2192O1 bond is rather large, that is usually appropriate to the bonds with \u03c0-contribution. The value of \u03b4(N1\u2192O1) is even close to \u03b4(N2\u2192O2).The presence of different substituents in the heterocycle may vary the properties and, as the result, the reactivity of N-oxides. Apparently, the variation of the substituents gives wide possibilities to chemical modifications of N-oxides and allows to change their biological activity.",
