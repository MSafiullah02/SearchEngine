Few information on clinical features and immunological profile of COVID-19 in paediatrics. The clinical features and treatment outcomes of twelve paediatric patients confirmed as COVID-19 were analyzed. The immunological features of children patients was investigated and compared with twenty adult patients. The median age was 14.5-years (range from 0.64 to 17), and six of the patients were male. The average incubation period was 8 days. Clinically, cough (9/ 12, 75%) and fever (7/12, 58.3%) were the most common symptoms. Four patients (33.3%) had diarrhea during the disease. As to the immune profile, children had higher amount of total T cell, CD8\u00fe T cell and B cell but lower CRP levels than adults (P < 0.05). Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and local patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest CT scan. All patients received antiviral and symptomatic treatment and the symptom relieved in 3e4 days after admitted to hospital. The paediatric patients showed mild symptom but with longer incubation period. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had different immune profile with higher T cell amount and low inflammatory factors level, which might ascribed to the mild clinical symptom. We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom.

Elder people with underlying disease or immunocompromised are prone to develop severe situation such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. 9e11 One recent studies that have reported clinical characteristics of 1099 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and found that 0.9% of patients were aged below 15-year-old, suggesting the incidence of COVID-19 in children is much lower than adults. 12 However, the clinical features of child and adolescents was not reported. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical features of twelve children diagnosed as COVID-19 in Chongqing area. Through this study, we sought to delineate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children.",

Children showed higher level of T cell and its subgroup cells (CD8\u00fe T cells and B cells), but lower IL-6 and CRP level after infection. T lymphocytes exert antivirus function and balance immune response. In SARS-CoV infection, CD8\u00fe T cells were the main inflammatory cells infiltrated into the pulmonary and played a vital role in virus clearance. However, it could also induce immune injury by inflammation cytokines. 16, 17 In another study about SARS-CoV, depletion of CD4\u00fe T cells led to reduced capability of lymphocytes recruitment and cytokine production, which resulted in immune mediated delayed clearance of SARS-CoV. 18 SARS-Cov-2 shares high similarity in genome and protein structure with SARS-CoV, the immune response of these two disease might be similar to some extent. IL-6 a key cytokine contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions. It can be promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and involved in the production of acute phase proteins including CRP, proliferation of B-lymphocytes and neutrophils. 19 The serum IL-6 level usually increase during infection and dramatically elevation of serum IL-6 often associated with severe infection. 20, 21 Antonio and his colleagues have reported that children with H1N1infection induces an early and significant upregulation of IL-6 expressions. Importantly, IL-6 was significantly correlated with specific clinical findings, such as severity of respiratory compromise and fever. 22 In our study, only two paediatric patients (16%) showed elevated IL-6 level with less than 5 fold increases. The average level of IL-6 in paediatrics was lower than adults, which may be partially responsible for the less severe symptoms in paediatric patients. Additionally, as children usually belong to the second or thirdgeneration infection, the virulence of virus may be decreased when children infected. Interestingly, we didn't tracked further infection transmitted by these patients. This might be due to the immune situation and low viral load for children. Whether children were less capability in disease spreading and the underlying mechanism needs more investigation. This study have several limitations. First, the small sample size of this study due to low incidence of COVID-19 in children. In this study, we enrolled twelve cases for analysis, which might cause the incomplete understanding the clinical features of this group. Multi-center study recruiting more patients with different age group is required in future. Secondly, since all the clinical data were collected retrospectively, the information, particular the laboratory information, was incompletely in some individuals. Finally, most patients were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. This may affect the judgement of the final outcome and continued observations is needed. Taking together, this study described the clinical features of paediatric patients infected SARS-CoV-2. The paediatrics showed mild symptom and different immune profile. Therefore, paediatric patients are easily to be ignored in practice. We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom. ",
