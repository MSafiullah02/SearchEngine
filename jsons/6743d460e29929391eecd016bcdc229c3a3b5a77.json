Hypoxia and viral infectivity share common pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) [1, 2] Fig. 1 . In addition, inotropes and vasoactive agents, often used in ICU treatments, can increase tissue injury and viral load via p38 MAPK activation [1, 2] . Therefore, a vicious cycle is established in viral sepsis leading to high mortality despite the current therapies. Epinephrine and dobutamine use in sepsis is reported to be associated with increased mortality and atrial fibrillation [3] .",

This novel reparative action of TH is currently investigated in the ThyRepair trial (EudraCT: 2016-000631-40) in patients with anterior STEMI undergoing angioplasty.
