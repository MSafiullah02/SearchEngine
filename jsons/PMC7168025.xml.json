All are developing countries with emerging economies; some more than others. In 2010\u20132011, their gross domestic product based on purchasing\u2010power\u2010parity (PPP) per capita range from China 92nd of 183 countries at $8,382, Indonesia 122nd at $4666, India 129th at $3,694, Nigeria 141st $2,578, and Bangladesh 155th at $1,693.3 Of note, Norway was in 4th place with $53, 471 per capita.",

A Medline search in 2006 using the terms \u201cpneumonia or acute lower respiratory infection, children, risk factors, developing country, hospitalized\u201d revealed only 26 studies none of which focused on risk factors for need for intensive care nor subsequent outcomes. Substituting the term China or India for developing country in the search added no studies. A broader search with the terms \u201ccommunity acquired pneumonia, children, intensive care\u201d revealed few relevant articles in a developing country among the 35 retrieved. None of those retrieved were particularly helpful as the PICU cohort was too small to delineate risk factors for ventilation and fatality,4 the study were focused on hospital not PICU factors,5 or was predominately centered on a specific pathogen.6, 7 Hence in 2007, a 4 year prospective study in a large children's hospital in southern China was under taken to determine presenting PICU admission features, factors associated with need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay and risk of fatality in children with community acquired pneumonia severe enough to require intensive care.",

In contrast, rickets was a major associated factor in fatalities in the earlier reports from Yehman.13, 14 Breast feeding is universal in the first year in this region in China so could not be evaluated as an associated risk factor. Bacteremia was detected rarely in this PICU cohort (0.7%) possibly because all had received antibiotics prior to admission to the PICU, even the ones admitted directly to the PICU. Two more recent studies, one from India18 with 200 children reported in 2007 and the other from the Philippines19 with 1,249 children also reported in 2007 have noted the importance of bacteremia (15% and 2.6% respectively).

However, in developing countries with more resources such as Bangladesh, Thailand, and Pakistan who have also used the community health worker model with good outcomes,21 being able to prioritize early those likely in need of the aggressive support available in a PICU might well improve CAP outcomes. Having these community health workers taught how to recognize pneumonia, treat early with simple antibiotics and then refer urgently if signs such as nodding, altered sensorium and/or grunting are present might facilitate more timely presentation to major centers where additional care options such as assisted ventilation in a PICU is possible.",

The bacterial cases may well have been underestimated because as noted above all had received antibiotics prior to the blood or endotracheal cultures being collected. A 2009 case control study from Brazil suggests that Haemophilus influenzae b vaccine could prevent an estimated 30% of hospitalized cases of radiologically definite CAP in children under 2 years of age.22 Our earlier prospective study of children hospitalized with CAP in Northwest China also noted H. influenzae b and S. pneumoniae as relatively common pathogens.23 Of note, the World Health Organization Global Action Plan For Prevention and Control of Pnuemonia in 2008 listed immunization coverage for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae b as well as immunization against measles and pertussis as top prevention strategies.2 This PICU study from China supports the observation from Thailand that Mycoplasma is an important pathogen in children in developing countries hospitalized with CAP including those aged 2\u20135 years24 and extends it to include those with CAP in the PICU. Mycoplasma was the most common bacterial pathogen detected, found in 11% overall and 47% of those with a bacterial pathogen. No child in this PICU cohort was over 5 years of age.",

This study provides yet more evidence on the importance of universal immunization with vaccines against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae b as recommended by the World Health Organization. Even access to quality PICU support cannot overcome the serious morbidity associated with these bacteria. Prevention is a better option. Countries with emerging economies like India and China need to move forward to provide these two vaccines to all of their children. Beyond this prevention strategy, given the very large numbers of children in China and India and the increasing access to PICUs in many regions early recognition and referral of severe cases may also help to decrease fatalities. More studies are needed to hone best practices for managing pneumonia coming from the community in different developing country settings. This further confirmation that altered sensorium, head nodding and grunting are markers for increased fatality raises the question of whether more training on these markers at the community health worker level can increase recognition and speed of referral for highest risk cases to centers with PICUs.",
