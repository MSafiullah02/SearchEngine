            "text": "Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a member of Family Reoviridae, genus orthoreovirus. A prototype strain of PRV was first isolated from flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) in Nelson Bay, Australia in 1968 (Gard and Compans, 1970, Gard and Marshall, 1973). PRV had been a sole member comprising the PRV group for a considerable period until a second case of the PRV strain Pulau was reported from bat species in Malaysia in 2006 (Pritchard et al., 2006). The first human case of PRV infection by the PRV strain Melaka was reported in Malaysia in 2007 from a patient with high fever and respiratory disease (Chua et al., 2007). Since the first case of PRV infection in humans, evidence of PRV infections in humans (Cheng et al., 2009, Chua et al., 2007, Chua et al., 2008, Chua et al., 2011, Voon et al., 2015, Wong et al., 2012, Yamanaka et al., 2014) and bats (Du et al., 2010, Hu et al., 2014, Lorusso et al., 2015) in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries and China have been reported. Phylogenetic studies showed there were genetically close relationships between PRV strains of human and bat origin implying that PRVs are bat-borne zoonoses (Chua et al., 2007). In particular, one of the PRV-infected patients had a history of close contact with bats before the onset of illness (Chua et al., 2007). This epidemiological situation supports the hypothesis that patients might obtain infection from bats; however, there has been no direct evidence to show connections between bat and human regarding PRV transmission.",

Furthermore, a recent epidemiological study based on PCR detected the PRV genome from 34 of 200 patients with acute upper respiratory tract infection indicating that PRV can be considered as a common pathogen in ASEAN countries causing mild respiratory infections (Voon et al., 2015). Taken together, these reports suggest that PRV has evolved to cross the species barrier between bats and humans.",

Previously, studies of the pathogenicity of PRV infection in humans have been evaluated based on the limited numbers of human infection cases owing to the lack of experimental animal models. Experimental infections of PRV were limited to a primary trial using PRV strain Nelson Bay (Gard and Marshall, 1973) inoculated to suckling mice, which were killed by intra-cranial infection. The experiment was, however, obviously dissociated from spontaneous respiratory infection in humans as there were no reports of PRV infection in the central nervous system. However, since the first report of a human case of PRV infection, no animal models for PRV infection reflecting human respiratory infections have been developed.",

We identified significant differences in the susceptibility to PRV infections between mouse strains. Intranasal infection caused lethal outcome with severe pneumonia whereas oral infections was not established, suggesting that PRV is an air-borne transmissible pathogen. In addition, mice repeatedly infected with PRV developed antibodies to particular viral proteins. Such serologic information will contribute to the development of protocols for sero-epidemiological studies and sero-diagnosis. Furthermore, an animal model for pathogenic PRV infection provides a crucial opportunity to understand virus pathogenesis and to evaluate vaccines and therapeutics to combat this important pathogen.",

Production of antibodies against PRV proteins was further confirmed by western blotting (WB). In WB, mouse serum reacted to fewer numbers of viral proteins compared to in the FFA assay, including \u03bcB, \u03c3C, \u03bbA, \u03bcNS, and \u03c3NS (\nFig. 5 and Table 2). These results suggest that an immunofluorescence assay using cells infected with PRV or expressing particular PRV proteins may represent an appropriate method for sero-epidemiological studies of PRV.",

However, information regarding the tissue tropism of PRV in bat is not available. Bats are known to be naturel reservoirs of numerous zoonotic viruses including highly pathogenic viruses, filoviruses, rabies viruses, Nipahviruses, and coronaviruses (Calisher et al., 2006). The importance of bats as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses can be characterized by the feature that bats often permit persistent infection of highly pathogenic viruses without presenting symptoms. As it is not known whether PRV causes pathogenic, respiratory infection in bats, it could not be concluded from this study whether the C3H mouse model reflects PRV infection in bats. Further pathological studies regarding PRV infection in bats would be required to better understand PRV spread and transmission in nature.",

However, there are no reports regarding cytokine induction after PRV infection. In particular, the inflammatory chemokine IP-10 is induced by various virus infections and recruits activated T-cells to the site of inflammation (Liu et al., 2011). In the current study we found that the levels in blood IP-10 correlated with viral load in the mice intranasally or orally infected with PRV, suggesting that IP-10 serve as an index to predict acute PRV infection.",

In other virus studies, C3H was also reported to be highly sensitive to Sendai virus and measles virus infections (Neighbour et al., 1978, Niewiesk et al., 1993, Parker et al., 1978), whereas this mouse strain is resistant to murine hepatitis virus and murine cytomegalovirus (Allan and Shellam, 1984, Bang and Warwick, 1960). The mechanisms underlying different susceptibilities to these viruses have been considered to be due to the different immune responses or presence of virus binding receptors. Although there was no evidence to explain the highest susceptibility of C3H mice to PRV infection, further analysis regarding the different susceptibilities among the mouse strains (i.e., C3H vs ICR, Balb/c, C57BL/6) would help to understand the molecular mechanisms of PRV pathogenicity, in particular how the genetic background of the host influences the outcome of PRV replication and pathogenesis. It should be noted that only young (4-week-old) male mice were included in this study, although PRV was detected exclusively in adult patients (26\u201354 years old) (Cheng et al., 2009, Chua et al., 2007, Chua et al., 2008, Chua et al., 2011, Wong et al., 2012, Yamanaka et al., 2014). Further, it should be noted that 4-week-old mice are not immunologically mature (Jackson et al., 2017). To explore the association between the mouse model and natural infection, further studies are required employing female mice or mice of a wider age range. No sign of cell-cell fusion in infected lung tissues was observed. These results suggest that PRV strain MB does not induce syncytium formation in vivo, or that the disruption of damaged cells makes it difficult to identify cell-cell fusion in the targeted tissues.",

The results of NT tests demonstrated that PRV are serologically independent from these viruses. Although ARV-, MRV-, and RV-specific antisera were not tested, investigation regarding whether PRV infection was cross-neutralized by antibodies to other Reoviridae viruses would help to understand the epidemiology of PRV. Furthermore, the significant difference in the NT assay results of PRV between A549 and L929 cells could be explained by the different usage of viral ligands for cell attachment during PRV infection. We have recently demonstrated that PRV utilizes the virus structural protein \u03c3C for entry into A549 but not L929 cells (Kawagishi et al., 2016). In the NT assay using A549 cells, antibodies against \u03c3C in serum from mice infected with PRV worked effectively as a neutralizing antibody but not in L929 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, \u03c3C comprises one of the major viral proteins that induce specific antibodies. It was thus reasonable that a high amount of neutralizing antibody against \u03c3C in infected mice sera caused high NT activity in A549 cells and it could be concluded that A549 cells could therefore be recommended for NT assays in sero-epidemiological studies of PRV.",

In general, antibodies that were reactive only in FFA recognize conformational epitopes whereas those reactive only in WB recognize linear epitopes owing to the different methods used in sample preparation. In the present study, mouse serum reacted to \u03bbC and \u03c3A at quite high titer in the FFA assay but was not reactive in the WB assay, which probably occurred because the antibodies likely recognize only the conformational epitope but not the linear epitope. In FFA and WB assays, a fairly strong reaction was observed to the \u03c3C protein. As \u03c3C, which is located at the surface of the virion, functions as a cell-attaching viral protein, it is reasonable that antibodies were induced to this protein. \u03c3C is known to be highly variable between PRV isolates, probably because neutralizing antibody pressure might drive the rapid mutation of this protein. Owing to the high variation in \u03c3C sequences, \u03c3C may therefore not represent an appropriate target for sero-epidemiological studies for a broad range of PRV strains but may instead be suitable for detecting specific virus strains.",

            "text": "In contrast, the other viral proteins that induced specific antibodies, including six structural proteins (\u03bbC, \u03bbA, \u03bcB, \u03c3C, \u03c3A, and \u03c3B) and two non-structural proteins (\u03bcNS and \u03c3NS) are relatively conserved between the PRV isolates reported to date. Notably, although it was anticipated that antibodies were raised preferentially to outer proteins that could readily be exposed to immune cells, the antibodies to the two NS proteins were not expected. \u03bcNS and \u03c3NS of PRV likely generate viral inclusion bodies (VIBs) during the replication cycle as a common structure in family Reoviridae, although the functions of these proteins are not yet defined. VIBs are a site of virion assembly, which are usually found exclusively in the cytoplasm and not spontaneously released to outside cells. Conversely, our results suggest that VIBs are released outside the cell probably by the disruption of PRV-infected cells. There have been no reports regarding NT activity of antibodies against VIB. Thus, the six structural and two NS proteins constitute candidate viral proteins for sero-epidemiological studies. Especially, \u03bbA, \u03bcB, \u03bcNS, and \u03c3NS, which were positive both in FFA and WB assays, are recommended as primary choices for target antigens, although differences in the properties of antibody recognition between host species must be considered (i.e., human patients may develop antibodies to different viral proteins than those recognized in the mouse infection model). In WB analysis, there were discrepancies in the band patterns of \u03bbA and \u03c3C as revealed by anti-PRV serum and anti-HA antibody. These results indicate that anti-PRV serum recognizes particular sites on each viral protein. Although processing of PRV proteins after synthesis has not been studied, protein degradation or truncated bands revealed by using anti-HA tag antibody may be indicative of specific protein processing important for biological function. Further analysis of the processing of these viral proteins could enable the characterization of each PRV protein.",

Our established animal model of lethal lung infection of PRV could thus contribute to primary examination of the pathogenicity of PRV strains isolated from humans and bats. Furthermore, we have recently developed a plasmid-based reverse-genetics (RG) system of PRV (Kawagishi et al., 2016) that enabled us to generate mutant viruses affecting virus virulence. Combined studies incorporating the PRV RG system and the lethal mouse model established in the current study will likely facilitate disclosure of the mechanisms underlying the high virulence of PRV and promote the development and evaluation of vaccines and treatments against this pathogenic reovirus.",
