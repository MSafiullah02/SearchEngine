Around 5%\u201310% of COVID-19 patients require mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure (ARF), of whom 65%\u201385% are classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome (Wu et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020).

However, radiology societies have advised against the systematic use of computed tomography (CT) and have suggested reducing the number of chest X-rays (CXRs) in COVID-19, to minimize the exposure of health care providers to this highly infective disease (Simpson et al. 2020). In this context, lung ultrasound (LUS) could be the ideal imaging technique as it is available at the bedside, it is performed directly by the in-charge physicians and it provides reliable information for diagnosis and monitoring of ARF (Chiumello et al. 2018; Mojoli et al. 2019; Pescarissi et al. 2020). The aim of our study was to test whether the systematic use of a LUS-based approach could reduce the number of conventional radiologic exams during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

Because our health care providers have high skills and experience in LUS and habitually use ultrasound in daily management of ARF patients, although in general integrated with traditional imaging, from the beginning we decided to use an LUS-based approach. The aim of this self-imposed limitation was to minimize transport of COVID-19 patients to the radiology department, reduce the number of bedside CXRs and therefore reduce the exposure of health care professionals. A complete 12-area examination, with computation of the LUS score (Mongodi et al. 2017), is performed daily with a Vivid iq ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). A 9-MHz linear probe is used if the pleural line is visualized with one focus on the pleural line, artifact-erasing software and harmonics are abolished, and depth is adjusted to be at least twice the depth of the pleural line (Mongodi et al. 2019); a phased-array probe is used in case of consolidations or pleural effusions. The complete LUS examination is finalized to monitor lung aeration; guide the respiratory strategy, that is, positive end-expiratory pressure titration, pronation (Bouhemad et al. 2011; Mojoli et al. 2019); and identify complications (i.e., pneumothorax and ventilator-associated pneumonia [Mongodi et al. 2016; Mojoli et al. 2019]). On-duty physicians are free to perform CT or CXR when deemed necessary. Operators were either recognized experts in the field or trainees who had completed 25 supervised examinations (Rouby et al. 2018).",
