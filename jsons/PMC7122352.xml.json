This patient may have proved particularly difficult to sedate using midazolam. Propofol would be an option but the airway would not be protected.

The connection is kept patent by the deployment of an expandable metal stent across it, so that some of the portal venous blood flow is shunted to the systemic circulation, thereby decreasing portal pressure and decreasing variceal bleeding. Several studies have shown that TIPS is very effective for refractory variceal hemorrhage. The TIPS is formed by passing a needle catheter via the transjugular route into the hepatic vein and wedging it there. The needle is then extruded into the liver parenchyma and attempts are made to find a branch of the intrahepatic portion of the portal vein. Figure 37.1 shows the catheter in place in the portal vein. A series of balloon catheters are then used to dilate the tract from the hepatic vein to the portal vein (Fig. 37.2) and the stent, which is typically a 10-mm diameter covered wire mesh device, is inserted (Fig. 37.3).\n\n\n",

Approximately 2% is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remaining acetaminophen is metabolized via the hepatic cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase pathway to a toxic, highly reactive intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQ1). Appropriate acetaminophen doses produce a small amount of NAPQ1 which is rapidly conjugated with hepatic glutathione, forming nontoxic cysteine and mercaptate compounds that are excreted in the urine. However, with toxic doses of acetaminophen, the sulfation and glucuronidation pathways become saturated, and more acetaminophen is metabolized to NAPQ1 via cytochrome P450. When hepatic glutathione stores are depleted by approximately 75%, NAPQ1 begins to react with hepatocytes and leads to injury and necrosis.

Perhaps the most widely recognized of these models, however, is the King\u2019s College Criteria (see table above). This model was developed in a cohort of over 500 patients who were managed between 1973 and 1985. Recommendations for liver transplantation were based upon the results. The predictors of outcome were stratified according to whether the ALF was caused by acetaminophen or \u201cother\u201d causes. The positive and negative predictive values of the Kings College Criteria for mortality in patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF (not including patients who were transplanted) are 88 and 65%, respectively",

When the SVC is obstructed superior to the azygous vein, venous blood is redirected downhill as it flows through the esophageal veins into the azygous vein. This results in development of downhill varices in the upper to mid esophagus. The most common etiologies of downhill varices are malignancies such as lung cancers and mediastinal tumors. Other potential etiologies include mediastinal fibrosis, substernal goiter, and trauma from central intravenous line placement. The patient may also have other signs of SVC obstruction such as dyspnea, dysphagia, facial and arm swelling, plethora, and headache.

The patient was \u201cfound down\u201d in her kitchen by her 14-year-old son. She was diaphoretic, grasping for air, holding her chest, complaining of severe, crushing pain. Upon arrival, emergency medical service (EMS) documented her temperature as 99.1\u00b0F, heart rate 116, systolic blood pressure 82, and respiratory rate 22. Her oxygen saturation was 83% on room air. The patient\u2019s only other medical history includes long standing hypothyroidism. She underwent a carpal tunnel release on her right hand 4 years ago. Her prescription medications include hydrochlorothiazide and synthroid. She stopped taking her cholesterol medication (rosuvastatin) months ago as she thought it was the cause of her \u201caching muscles.\u201d She does suffer from chronic low back pain and takes as needed ibuprofen and acetaminophen. She took 3 g of acetaminophen two days prior to admission. Her husband notes that she has been complaining of intermittent chest discomfort for the last month. She was scheduled for an evaluation with her primary care physician next week. The patient lives with her husband of 28 years and their three healthy children. She works full-time as a school bus driver. She has a 20 pack year smoking history and currently smokes ten cigarettes per day. She averages between 6 and 8 beers per week. She has two tattoos, the first of which she obtained 25 years ago. Her father passed from pneumonia at the age of 59. He suffered from a debilitating stroke 1 year prior. Her mother died at the age of 66 from postoperative complications following an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient\u2019s 57-year-old brother has diabetes.",

The hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for liver injury were different in the four groups. In congestive heart failure and acute heart failure, the hypoxia of the liver resulted from decreased hepatic blood flow due to left-sided heart failure and from venous congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure. In chronic respiratory failure, liver hypoxia was mainly due to profound hypoxemia. In toxic/septic shock, oxygen delivery to the liver was not decreased, but oxygen demands were increased.

He also has developed new onset lower extremity edema in the last week. The patient\u2019s wife noticed some confusion and disorientation in the last several days. One day prior to admission, she noticed yellowing of his eyes. Review of systems is notable for nausea, constipation with intermittent rectal bleeding in the last month, dyspnea on exertion, and diaphoresis. One month prior, the patient and his wife were in South Carolina on vacation. There is no history of fevers, chills, sick contacts, or antibiotic use. The patient is a former police man and was involved in a work-related injury 3 years ago. Since then, he has been suffering with lower back pain. He is seen regularly in the chronic pain clinic and has been consistent with his physical therapy regimen. In the last several months, he has been able to wean to as needed narcotics, although in the last several weeks, his narcotic use had increased to hydrocodone/acetaminophen 7.5/750 up to 8 pills a day. He also has recently been diagnosed with depression and insomnia and was started on a low dose of amitriptyline. The patient lives with his wife of 4 years. He is monogamous and has never used illicit drugs. He drinks 10\u201314 beers per week. He does not smoke. He has no tattoos nor has he ever had any blood transfusion. He currently works at the department of motor vehicles. The patient\u2019s sister was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 24. She has been in remission for over 10 years.",

She has not been seen for some time, and we are not told her baseline bilirubin. However, she is coagulopathic, has an elevated white-cell count with abdominal tenderness in the setting of jaundice. She very likely has hepatic encephalopathy, but the question is what is the etiology? The main differential diagnosis is between alcoholic hepatitis and SBP, but the development of HCC or another infection is also possible. Apart from SBP, which is defined as infection in the ascitic fluid without evidence of an intraabdominal surgically treatable source, the possibility of secondary bacterial peritonitis (from a ruptured viscus \u2013 gallbladder, colon, or peptic ulcer) should be considered and abdominal imaging is advisable.",

The diagnosis of SBP is made on a positive culture and an elevated absolute polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) cell count of >250 cells/mm3. A small amount of the fluid should be sent for chemistry to determine the albumin content. In this case, the difference between the serum albumin and ascites albumin (serum ascites albumin gradient or SAAG) was 1.4 g/dl, indicative of portal hypertension. Another 10 ml should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside (rather than sent to the laboratory in a syringe since this reduces the sensitivity). The gram stain can be ordered but has a very low sensitivity in determining if bacteria are present.",
