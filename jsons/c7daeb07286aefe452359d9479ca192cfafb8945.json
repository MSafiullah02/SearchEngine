The virus was initially identified in people in Mexico and the US in March-April 2009. At the time of writing, there were 1490 confirmed human cases of this novel H1N1 infection in 21 cities across many continents. Hong Kong reported its first confirmed case of this novel H1N1 virus on May 1, 2009 . The severity of the human disease remains unclear, with most cases outside of Mexico having a mild clinical course. However, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the most severe influenza pandemic currently known, was also mild at the time of its initial emergence and only acquired virulence during the second wave of human disease in the winter season (3 ). Current mathematical model-based estimates predict that a new pandemic could result in 2-7.4 million deaths worldwide (4 ).",

Early detection in suspected patients is crucial for containing the disease and preventing ongoing transmission. Few well-validated laboratory diagnostic methods exist for the diagnosis of this novel H1N1 infection. The WHO defines a probable clinical case as one that is confirmed by (1) specific RT-PCR-based detection methods, (2) isolation of the novel H1N1 influenza virus, or (3) detection of a 4-fold rise of neutralization antibodies to this virus (5 ) . Biosafety level (BSL) 4 2 laboratories with BSL3 practices are recommended for virus isolation and serology, whereas PCR detection requires only a BSL2 environment (6 ) . Of the above diagnostic tests, only RT-PCR-based detection methods allow rapid detection of the swine-like H1N1 influenza virus within a few hours.",

FJ966082), we developed and evaluated several RT-PCR assays for the detection of this virus. We used these assays to help confirm the first case found in Hong Kong (7 ) . Here, we describe a conventional 1-step RT-PCR and a 1-step quantitative realtime RT-PCR that can detect this novel swine-like H1N1. Because many laboratories lack the novel A/California/04/2009-like H1N1 virus for use as a positive control for these tests, we used a swine H1 virus (A/SW/HK/PHK1578/03) previously isolated in our routine swine influenza surveillance program (unpublished results) as the positive control in this study. The primers and probes were designed to perfectly match both the swine-like H1N1 and A/SW/HK/PHK1578/ 03. We reasoned that regions of the genome that are conserved between swine H1 viruses in Asia and the swine-like novel H1N1 virus, but distinct from human seasonal H1N1 viruses, offer several advantages as targets for a molecular diagnostic test. More importantly, we reasoned that this approach might help to minimize the shipping and handling of A/California/04/2009like H1N1 viruses to laboratories that do not have the recommended biosafety facilities. Accidental release of the human adapted A/California/04/2009-like viruses from the laboratory poses public health concerns. The positive control Asian swine H1N1 virus (A/SW/HK/ PHK1578/03), which is not adapted to human transmission, is a much safer option and is available on request.",

Thus, a positive result in this assay clearly discriminates the novel H1N1 virus from seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses, but does not differentiate between the novel H1N1 and other swine H1 viruses. In the current context, however, a human specimen that has a H1 gene that is \"swine-like\" is sufficient to initiate a public health alert and referral to a reference laboratory for final confirmation. Although swine H1N1 or H1N2 viruses have infected humans in the past (9 ), they are exceedingly rare. A specimen found positive in the assay for the novel H1N1 virus we describe here can be confirmed by testing with other PCR methods specific for swine influenza A viruses (10 ) and by partial sequencing of one or more viral gene segments. For example, sequencing the RT-PCR amplicon generated from the M gene type A-specific assay (M30F: 5\u0408-TTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACG-3\u0408 and M264R2: 5\u0408-ACAAAGCGTCTACGCTGCAG-3\u0408) (11 ) will allow differentiation of the swine H1N1 virus from the novel human-adapted H1N1 virus.",

The annealing temperature is 60\u00b0C instead of 55\u00b0C.In preliminary testing, the limit of detection determined by serial dilutions was similar to that of the other real-time PCR assay described here. Amplification of viral RNA from swine H1 virus (A/SW/HK/PHK1578/ 03) as well as other negative controls (20 control nasopharyngeal aspirates, 2 seasonal human H1N1 viruses, 2 seasonal human H3N2 viruses, and 2 human H5N1 viruses) was negative. Hence, this assay can be used to specifically confirm the presence of the novel H1N1 virus causing the current outbreaks. However, the A/California/4/2009-like virus is required as a positive control. Additional evaluation and optimization of this assay is in progress. ",
