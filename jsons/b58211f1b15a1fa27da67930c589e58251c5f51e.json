            "text": "Birds are the natural reservoir of viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as contributing to the evolution, emergence, and dissemination of novel viruses. In this study, we applied a high-throughput screening approach to identify the diversity of viruses in 118 samples of birds captured between October 2006 to October 2010 in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. We found nearly complete genomes of novel species of astrovirus and calicivirus in cloacal swabs of ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) collected in Coroa do Avi\u00e3o islet, Pernambuco State. These viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a genome of ~7 to 8 kb, and were designated as Ruddy turnstone astrovirus (RtAstV) and Ruddy turnstone calicivirus (RTCV), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RtAstV and RTCV grouped in a monophyletic clade with viruses identified from poultry samples (i.e., chicken, goose, and turkey), including viruses associated with acute nephritis in chickens. Attempts of viral propagation in monkey and chicken cell lines for both viruses were unsuccessful. Also, we found genomes related with viral families that infect invertebrates and plants, suggesting that they might be ingested in the birds' diet. In sum, these findings shed new light on the diversity of viruses in migratory birds with the notable characterization of a novel astrovirus and calicivirus.",

These viruses spread primarily to vertebrates via the fecal-oral route and are associated with gastroenteritis worldwide 1-3 . Currently, the Astroviridae family is composed of 21 viral species, which are divided into two genera, the Avastrovirus genus that infects avian species, and Mamastrovirus genus that infects mammals including humans 4 . Avastroviruses are emerging pathogens that have been associated to cause diverse pathologies in birds, including enteritis, hepatitis, and nephritis, which have been associated with economic losses in the poultry industry (e.g., white chick disease) 5-8 . Additionally, mamastrovirus infections are characterized by gastroenteritis and in rare cases cause neurological syndromes and encephalitis 1, [9] [10] [11] . Human astroviruses (HAstV) are recognized to cause childhood viral gastroenteritis worldwide, but it has only been associated with neurotropism in immunocompromised patients 3,12-14 .",

Then, cDNAs were prepared for high-throughput sequencing using TruSeq Universal adapters (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and standard multiplex adaptors. A paired-end, 150-base-read protocol in RAPID module was used for sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing was performed in the Life Sciences Core Facility (LaCTAD) at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.
