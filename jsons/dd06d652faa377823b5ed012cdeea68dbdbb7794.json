RT-PCR using primers to conserved sequences in the ORF1b gene amplified a 794 bp region of either GAV or YHV. Nested PCR using a conserved sense primer and either a GAV-or YHV-specific antisense primer to a divergent sequence differentially amplified a 277 bp region of the primary PCR amplicon. Multiplexing the YHV antisense primer with a GAV antisense primer to another divergent sequence allowed the viruses to be distinguished in a single nested PCR. Nested PCR enhanced detection sensitivity between 100-and 1000-fold and GAV or YHV RNA was detectable in \u223c10 fg lymphoid organ total RNA. The multiplex RT-nested PCR was also able to co-detect GAV and YHV RNA mixed over a wide range of concentrations to simulate potential dual-infection states. The robustness of the test was examined using RNA samples from Penaeus monodon prawns infected either chronically or acutely with GAV or YHV and collected at different locations in Eastern Australia and Thailand between 1994 and 1998. GAV-(406 bp) or YHV-specific (277 bp) amplicons were differentially generated in all cases, including five YHV RNA samples in which no primary RT-PCR amplicon was detected. Sequence analysis of GAV and YHV PCR amplicons identified minor variations in the regions targeted by the virus-specific antisense primers. However, none occurred at positions that critically affected the PCR.

However, when GAV RNA was diluted in 100 ng/l YHV RNA and visa versa, the nested PCR detection limit of the minor viral RNA species (10 pg-1 ng) was found to be quenched 10 3 to 10 5 -fold compared to that (10 fg) observed in the absence of competitor. We do not know to what extent the RT and/or PCR steps contributed to this anomaly. However, the effect was concentration-dependent. When 1 ng/l rather than 100 ng/l competitor RNA was used, the detection limit of the minor viral RNAs (100 fg) approached that obtained without competitor.

YHV RNA samples were mainly from haemolymph while LO was mostly used for GAV. YHV was not detected in one sample using the standard conditions. However, by increasing the cDNA quantity used in the primary PCR, and primary PCR quantity used in the nested PCR, a YHV amplicon was detected.

Moreover, LO and gills appear to be a better source of GAV than haemocytes when infection levels are low (Cowley et al., 2000a) .

These primarily occurred at codon wobble positions and, among the YHV samples, many were due to the presence of two different nucleotides in relatively equal amounts. This was not unexpected as most YHV RNA samples came from tissues pooled from 5-10 prawns and it is likely that individuals contained minor genotypic variants.

However, these variations, including one which caused an A:C mismatch 1 nt from the 3 -end of primer G6, did not adversely affect the performance of the PCR. This is consistent with data demonstrating that single primer-template mismatches (other than A:G, G:A, C:C or A:A mismatches at the primer 3 -terminus) are unlikely to be deleterious to PCR (Sommer and Tautz, 1989; Kwok et al., 1990) . In all, the absence of substantial sequence variations in the ORF1b gene region targeted by the multiplex RT-nested PCR suggests the test should be quite robust in distinguishing the Thailand YHV genotype from the GAV genotype that occurs commonly in healthy and diseased P. monodon from Eastern Australia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 264, "end": 284, "text": "(Cowley et al., 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 285, "end": 308, "text": "(Cowley et al., , 2000b", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 309, "end": 338, "text": "Sittidilokratna et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1362, "text": "(Sommer and Tautz, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1381, "text": "Kwok et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Potential mechanisms for the inadvertent introduction of major prawn viral pathogens such as YHV, WSSV and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) into regions previously free of these agents are well documented (Lightner et al., 1997; Nunan et al., 1998) . Of primary concern is the translocation of frozen uncooked prawns or live broodstock and seed carrying unapparent virus infections. The sequence divergence between Thai YHV and Australian GAV isolates suggests that introductions of these or genetically related viruses, could be detected and traced to the source of the introduction. The multiplex RT-nested PCR described here provides a rapid and sensitive initial tool to co-detect and differentiate these viruses. However, we are currently obtaining P. monodon samples from other locations in Australia and Asia to determine the extent of genetic diversity among YH-complex viruses present in different prawn populations (Walker et al., 2001; Soowannayan et al., 2003) . Such epidemiological data will help establish whether these viruses are endemic or have been recently introduced through movements of brooders or postlarvae.
