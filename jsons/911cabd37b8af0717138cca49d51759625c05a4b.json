Unlike other non-segmented negative-strand RNA animal viruses, BDV replicates in the nucleus of the host cell where splicing is employed for expression of a very compact genome. Epidemiological studies indicate a broad host range and geographical distribution, and some investigators have proposed that human infection may result in neuropsychiatric disorders. Experimental Borna disease in neonatal and adult rats provides an intriguing model for immune-mediated disturbances of brain development and function.",

At approximately 9.9 kb the genomic RNA of BDV is substantially smaller than those of other Mononegavirales, the Rhabdoviridae (approximately 11\u00b115 kb), Paramyxoviridae (approximately 16 kb) and Filoviridae (approximately 19 kb). Complete BDV genomic sequences have been reported for two virus isolates, Strain V and He/80 [1, 2] , which are approximately 94% identical at the nucleotide level. BDV is characterised by extraordinary sequence conservation uncommon for RNA viruses, where the inherent low \u00aedelity of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) results in sequence divergence of 10 3 \u00b110 4 per site per round of replication [3] . Studies of two ORFs (nucleoprotein and phosphoprotein) from widely disparate BDV isolates revealed variability of up to 4.1% at the nucleotide level and 1.5% to 3% at the predicted amino acid level [4, 5] . A new genotype, termed No/98, with 15% divergence at nucleotide level was recently isolated from a naturally infected horse in Austria [6] .",

            "text": "The molar abundance of the individual BDV mRNAs in infected cultured cells and tissues [1, 2] resembles the 3k to 5k declining transcriptional gradient of rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses [10] . NNS RNA viruses typically contain signal sequences in the noncoding intergenic regions of the genome that specify transcriptional termination/polyadenylation and initiation by the viral polymerase complexes [10] . RNA circularisation and RT-sequencing over the ligated ends revealed that BDV contains three semiconserved, uracilrich initiation motifs, that are unique to BDV, and four stop signals that, similar to other Mononegavirales, contain an adenosine followed by six or seven uracil residues [9] . However, the gene junctions are atypical for Mononegavirales as they cannot be clearly divided into discrete regions corresponding to a termination signal for one transcription unit, an intergenic region and an initiation signal for the next transcription unit. The \u00aerst and the second transcription units overlap such that the second initiation signal S2 lies upstream of the \u00aerst termination signal T1 ( Figure 1) . A similar organisation is postulated to serve as an attenuation signal for control of polymerase expression in RSV [11]; however, in BDV, attenuation appears not to take place as the two transcription units are expressed at similar levels [1] . The second and third transcription units are separated by only two nucleotides, with the second termination signal, T2, fully contained within the third initiation signal S3. Initiation signal S3 gives rise to two different primary transcripts, the \u00aerst terminating at the third termination signal T3, the second is expressed by readthrough of T3 and termination at T4 ( Figure 1 ). Indeed, readthrough of T3 in BDV is essential for the expression of p190, the polymerase protein. Transcriptional readthrough may provide means for regulating expression of the BDV polymerase, a protein only needed in catalytic amounts. Consistent with this notion is the observation that levels of the 7.1 kb transcript are lower than those of the 2.8 kb transcript [1] .",

X is expressed from an ORF that initiates upstream of P and overlaps with this ORF in a +1 frame shift [7] . Expression levels relative to N and P have not been established but X is readily detected in infected cells and tissues. X is a cytoplasmatic protein when expressed in the absence of viral factors in transfected cells but localises to the nucleus in infected cells. This change in subcellular localisation appears to be mediated by direct interaction with P and indirect interaction with p40 [19-21], both of which possess NLS sequences. Interaction with viral proteins proposed to be involved in assembly of productive RNPs and coupling translation of X to P via a bicistronic mRNA suggests that X may play a role as cofactor for the viral RdRp. The amino terminus of X was recently shown to be critical for binding of P [21,22] and contains a leucine-rich region ( 2 SSDLRLTLLELVRRLN 17 ) that is similar to nuclear export sequences of other cellular and viral export proteins including HIV-1 Rev, HSV ICP 27, and PKI [23]. X may therefore also be involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of RNPs and/or subgenomic BDV transcripts in a fashion that may be modulated by binding of P.",

The phosphoproteins of NNS RNA viruses are essential cofactors for virus transcription and replication. Their phosphorylation by cellular kinases in\u00afuences the ability of phosphoproteins to form homomultimers, bind other viral proteins and serve as transcriptional activators. Although there are no direct data concerning the role of P in the BDV lifecycle, it is postulated to have a similar function to other viral phosphoproteins. P contains a strong bipartite NLS at its amino-terminus and appears to have weaker NLS motifs toward its carboxyl terminus [25] . Mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that P interacts with itself, X and N. Analysis of P truncation mutants led to identi\u00aecation of three nonoverlapping regions important for oligomerisation (aa 135\u00b1172), binding to X (aa 33\u00b1115) and N (aa 197\u00b1201) [20] .

Although this clinical pattern is still considered to represent classical BD, infection may also result in asymptomatic carrier status, subtle disturbances in learning and memory, profound disorders of behaviour and movement [39] [40] [41] [42] , or death. Accumulating epidemiological data, including reports of asymptomatic, naturally infected animals [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , suggest that the host range and geographical distribution of BDV are larger than previously appreciated. Natural infection has been reported in a wide variety of hosts including horses, donkeys, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rabbits and birds. Experimental infection has been achieved in many of these species and also in rodents and primates. Whether BDV naturally infects humans remains controversial; however, there is consensus that all warmblooded animals are likely to be susceptible to infection. Although Central Europe has the highest reported prevalence of Borna disease, natural infection has been described throughout Europe, in Asia and in North America. It is unclear whether the apparent increase in host and geographical range of BDV is due to spread of the virus or simply enhanced awareness of the agent and improved diagnostic reagents.",

Natural infection of horses and sheep is typically sporadic and peaks in spring months; epidemics of disease are infrequent (reviewed in [50] ). An olfactory route for transmission has been proposed because intranasal infection is ef\u00aecient and the olfactory bulbs of naturally infected horses show in\u00afammation and oedema early in the course of disease [51, 52] . One outbreak in a zoo has been attributed to inadvertent inoculation of BDV during vaccine administration (Mu \u00c8 ller H, personal communication). Experimental infection of neonatal rats results in virus persistence and is associated with the presence of viral gene products in saliva, urine and faeces [53] . Such secreta/excreta are known to be important in transmission of other pathogenic viruses (for example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, hantaviruses). Normal adult rats housed in cages separate but adjacent to those of neonatally infected rats can become infected suggesting the possibility of transmission by aerosol or fomites (Hornig M, Solbrig MV and Briese T, personal communication). Reports of BDV nucleic acid and proteins in PBMC also indicate a potential for haematogenous transmission [53, 54] . The observations that rodents can be persistently infected with BDV and excrete virus suggest that they have the potential to serve both as natural reservoirs and vectors for virus dissemination. However, the only study of BDV infection in wild rodents did not indicate natural infection [55] ; thus, the signi\u00aecance of rodents for transmission of BDV to other domesticated animals and humans remains speculative. Recently, vertical transmission of BDV has been demonstrated in a pregnant mare [56] .",

Clinical signs at the onset of disease in horses and sheep are nonspeci\u00aec and include: excited or depressed behaviour, hyperthermia, anorexia, jaundice, constipation and colic [42] . Classical disease becomes apparent within 1\u00b12 weeks. Animals maintain an upright, wide-based stance with their heads extended. Repetitive behaviours are common and may include vacuous chewing, circular ambulation and running into obstacles. Horses become paretic in the terminal phases of disease. A distinctive decubitus posture associated with paddling movements of the legs has been described. Frequently, in late disease the virus migrates centrifugally along the optic nerve to cause retinopathy and visual impairment. Acute mortality may be as high as 80%\u00b1100% in horses and 50% in sheep [42] . Sheep that survive may have permanent neurological de\u00aecits. Recurrence of acute disease has been described in sheep [57] . Natural symptomatic infection with fatal outcome has also been reported in cattle [58] , rabbits [59] , and one dog [60] . Epidemics of paresis in ostriches were attributed to BDV infection by serology [61] ; however, these data have not been con\u00aermed by other methods. Neurological disease in cats in Sweden [62] , Japan [63] and Great Britain [64] has been attributed to BDV infection using serology and molecular methods. BDV infection was found in cats with a speci\u00aec syndrome, staggering disease, in Sweden [65, 66] but not in Austria [67] .",

Nonetheless, any route of inoculation that allows virus access to nerve terminals (for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or footpad injection) ultimately results in central nervous system infection and classical disease. Viraemia is unlikely to play a signi\u00aecant role in BDV dissemination and pathogenesis. Although viral gene products have been found in PBMC of infected animals [87] intravascular inoculation only infrequently results in productive infection. Several observations indicate that BDV disseminates primarily via neural networks: (i) viral proteins and nucleic acids can be traced centripetally and transsynaptically after olfactory, ophthalmic or intraperitoneal inoculation [88, 89] ; (ii) the onset of disease is delayed in parallel with distance from the inoculation site to the central nervous system [89] ; and (iii) migration of virus to the CNS after footpad infection can be prevented by sciatic nerve transection [89] . Irrespective of the route of inoculation, the onset of clinical disease coincides with appearance of viral proteins in hippocampal neurons and the onset of meningitis [89, 90] . It has been proposed that BDV, like rabies virus, is likely to spread as an RNP complex within neural networks [91] . Although structures consistent with RNPs have been described in neurons of experimentally infected animals [81, 92] the form of disseminating virus is unknown.",

The movement and behaviour disorder is improved following treatment with selective dopamine antagonists; whereas D2-selective antagonists (for example, raclopride) do not affect locomotor responses in BD rats, high doses of selective D1 antagonists (for example, SCH23390) and atypical dopamine blocking agents with mixed D1 and D2 antagonist activity (such as clozapine) selectively reduce locomotor activity in BD rats but not in controls [94] .",

The expression of genes for neuromodulatory substances and their associated synthesising enzymes, including somatostatin, cholecystokinin and glutamic acid decarboxylase, is greatly reduced during the acute phase and recovers toward normal in the chronic phase of adult BD [100] . The cholinergic system, a major component in sensorimotor processing, learning and memory, also appears to be affected in adult BDV infection. A progressive decrease in the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive \u00aebres in hippocampus and neocortex has been observed to begin as early as day 6 postinfection [101] . Preliminary work on dysregulation of the 5HT and norepinephrine (NE) systems suggests metabolic hyperactivity of 5HT. There is a modest increase in the 5HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the striatum and of the NE metabolite 3-methoxy-4hydroxyphenethyleneglycol in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex [96] . These changes may re\u00afect compensatory upregulation following partial loss of dopamine afferents to these brain regions. Selective effects of BDV on 5HT and NE pre-or postsynaptic receptors have not yet been investigated. The mechanism by which adult BD rats are rendered hypersensitive to the hyperkinetic and convulsant effects of the opiate antagonist, naloxone [102] , is also unclear. In addition, because adult infected rats have marked CNS in\u00afammation, it has not been possible to determine whether monoamine, cholinergic and opiatergic dysfunction in BD results from direct effects of the virus, virus effects on resident cells of the CNS, or a cellular immune response to viral gene products.",

It is also present at lower levels in non-neural tissues including bone marrow, thymus and PBMC [53, 54] . Although numbers of mononuclear in\u00afammatory cells in the CNS are markedly reduced during the chronic phase of disease, there is an elevation in titres of antibodies directed against all BDV proteins (N, X, P, M, G and L). Antibodies speci\u00aec for M [33] and G have neutralising activity in vitro [36, 37] . Although virus is not cleared from the brain, neutralising antibodies may modulate viral gene expression [104] and limit the infection to the CNS, preventing further dissemination to nonneural organs [103] . The blood\u00b1brain barrier remains functional in various assays [104\u00b1106] . The life expectancy of animals that have progressed into the chronic phase may be normal, although loss of parenchymal brain tissue, low during the acute phase, continues at an increased rate and can reduce brain mass by up to 50% [93, 107] (Figure 2C ).",

They are smaller than uninfected littermates [108, 109] , have a heightened taste preference for salt solutions, and altered sleep\u00b1wake cycles [108] . The basis for runting is unknown: there is no apparent alteration in levels of glucose, growth hormone, or insulin-like growth factor-1 [108] or amount of food ingested [110] . Behavioural disturbances are less dramatic in neonatally infected animals than in their adult-infected counterparts. A study of behavioural and cognitive changes in Wistar rats infected in the neonatal period found spatial and aversive learning de\u00aecits, increased motor activity and decreased anxiety responses [111] . Similar de\u00aecits in spatial learning and memory were found by Carbone and colleagues in neonatally infected Lewis rats [108] . More recently, play behaviour has been reported to be abnormal in neonatal infected rats, with decreases in both initiation of nondominancerelated play interactions and response to initiation of play by noninfected, age-matched control animals or infected littermates [112] . The neonatal infection model has not been studied as extensively as the adult infection model. CNS dysfunction in neonatally infected animals has been proposed to be linked to viral effects on morphogenesis of the hippocampus ( Figure 2D ) and cerebellum (Figure 3) , two structures in rodents that continue to develop after birth [113] [114] [115] [116] . Carbone and colleagues found a quantitative relationship of hippocampal pathology to behavioural abnormalities in the neonatal infection model; the extent of neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus appeared to be correlated with the severity of spatial learning and memory de\u00aeciencies in neonatally infected Lewis rats [108] .",

TF is a member of the class II cytokine receptor family primarily produced by astrocytes that plays important roles in cellular signal transduction, brain function and neural development through its effects on coagulation protease cascades. However, cerebellar changes cannot be explained by this mechanism, as TF upregulation is not observed in the cerebellum despite prominent astrocytosis. Furthermore, BDV infection of astrocytes appears to be required for TF upregulation [119] , and cerebellar astrocytes are reported to be spared from BDV infection, at least for 30 days following neonatal infection [110] .",

Antibodies to CD4 and CD8 markers were initially used to deplete these cells and investigate their individual contributions to immunopathogenesis. Although depletion of either CD4 + or CD8 + T lymphocytes ameliorated the in\u00afammatory response in the brain and the severity of acute clinical disease [128, 129] , only depletion of CD8 + cells was found to reduce brain atrophy [130] . While these data may suggest that CD4 + T lymphocytes are not important in BD pathogenesis, more recent studies demonstrated that the recruitment of CD8 + cells is dependent on CD4 + T lymphocytes [131] .

Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from BD rat brain were found to lyse infected target cells in an MHC class I-restricted manner [133] .

The numbers of macrophages, CD4 + T lymphocytes and CD8 + T lymphocytes in brain are markedly reduced; however, the number of plasma cells are increased. In contrast to the immunopathogenesis of acute BD which has been studied extensively by several investigators, little is known about the basis for the decline in CNS in\u00aeltration in chronic infection. Potential mechanisms include altered viral gene expression or modulation of the immune response. The \u00aerst possibility is unlikely because viral titres do not change substantively over the course of disease [93] . In addition, brain levels of N and P, the only BDV proteins which can be readily quantitated, and of RNAs coding for M, G and L [134] are similar in early and late disease. There is, however, increasing evidence for modulation of the immune response over the course of BD. Recent \u00aendings indicate the induction of BDV-speci\u00aec type 1 T lymphocyte (Th 1 ) tolerance in chronic infection. Whereas lymphocytes isolated from brains of acutely infected rats have potent cytolytic activity, lymphocytes from brains of chronically infected rats do not lyse BDV-infected target cells [135] . Induction of BDV-speci\u00aec tolerance in chronic infection may re\u00afect the timecourse for presentation of viral antigens in the thymus [54] . Alternatively, Th 1 cells may become anergic or undergo apoptosis due to presentation of BDV antigens in brain without essential costimulatory signals [136] [137] [138] . Support for this hypothesis is found in the observation that apoptosis of perivascular in\u00afammatory cells is most apparent at 5\u00b16 weeks post infection, coincident with the onset of decline in encephalitis [139] .",

Cytokine mRNA levels were measured in rat brain at different times post-infection by RT-PCR [140] , RNase protection assay or northern hybridisation [139] . IFNc, TNFa, IL1a and IL6 mRNAs are transiently expressed in the acute phase of the disease [139, 140] . The message for another pro-in\u00afammatory cytokine, IL2, was detected by RT-PCR experiments throughout infection [140] ; however, RNase protection assays revealed that IL2 mRNA peaks in the acute phase of infection and declines thereafter [139] . IL2 and IFNc are produced by Th 1 cells for recruitment and activation of CTL and stimulation of antigen presenting cells [141] . The peak in CNS levels of these proin\u00afammatory cytokine mRNAs in acute BD is temporally correlated with the peak of the immune cell in\u00aeltration. Cytokines produced by type 2 T lymphocytes (Th 2 ), such as IL4, have the potential to downregulate the cellular immune response. IL4 mRNA levels are elevated throughout the course of BD, but increased in the chronic phase of infection [139] . IL10 mRNA, as measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR, peaks in the acute phase of BD and declines thereafter [139] . As in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [142] , the peak in IL10 mRNA expression is correlated with a shift away from CNS recruitment of immune cells. The high levels of IL4, IL6 and IL10 mRNAs observed in acute BD are likely to contribute to B cell activation. Indeed, in rats, progression toward the chronic phase of disease is accompanied by an increase in brain levels of BDV-speci\u00aec antibodies [139] .",

TGFb has potential to mediate inhibition of the pro-in\u00afammatory effects of TNFa, suppression of T and B cell growth, reduction of free radical formation and inhibition of antibody production and CTL activity [143, 144] .

There are no data to indicate whether presentation of antigen on MHC class I is insuf\u00aecient or activation of the Th 1 cells is inef\u00aecient due to inadequate costimulation. How-ever, the result of this switch is consistent with induction of Th 1 down-regulation, an event that would allow survival of the host and foster viral persistence. [91] and may not be uniformly distributed throughout the brain [91, 146] . These factors may confound the recovery of virus isolates and the detection of BDV gene products by in situ hybridisation or histochemistry. (iii) Detection of BDV in the periphery is also dif\u00aecult. Neutralising antibodies con\u00aene BDV to the CNS [103] ; however, BDV gene products have been detected in PBMC of infected ungulates and rodents and are reported by some investigators in either mononuclear cells or an as yet unde\u00aened cell that puri\u00aees with granulocytes in Ficoll preparations [147] . Those investigators who report detection of BDV nucleic acids in blood cells have employed nested RT-PCR, a method that is exquisitely sensitive to contamination artifact. Unfortunately, ampli\u00aecation products representing bona \u00aede isolates cannot be readily distinguished from laboratory strains by sequence analysis because BDV is characterised by extraordinary sequence conservation [4, 5] . Thus, similarities in sequence between putative new isolates and con\u00aermed isolates cannot be used to exclude the former as artifacts. The extent to which sequence conservation in BDV represents enhanced polymerase \u00aedelity, or more likely, selective environmental pressures is unknown. Most reports suggesting an association between BDV and human disease have focused on neuropsychiatric disorders including unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia; however, BDV has also been linked to chronic fatigue syndrome, AIDS encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, panic disorders and brain tumours (glioblastoma multiforme) (Tables 1  and 2 ). The improbably broad spectrum of candidate disorders has led some investigators to propose that infection is ubiquitous and that in some disorders, elevation of serum antibody titres or the presence of viral transcripts in PBMC or neural tissues re\u00afects generalised (AIDS) or localised (glioblastoma multiforme) immunosuppression.",

Two observations suggest that M is expressed at the surface of viral particles and mediates the attachment of the virions to cellular receptors: (i) antisera against M have neutralising activity [33]; and (ii) incubation of susceptible cells with M prevents infection [31]. The role of M in the BDV life cycle remains to be determined. In nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, the third gene usually directs expression of a matrix protein. Matrix proteins in Mononegavirales are not known to be glycosylated; however, glycosylated matrix proteins that resemble M in size and isoelectric point of about 10 units have been found in other viral systems (for example, M (E1), in coronaviruses [34]). Further studies need to be done to verify whether M is an unusual matrix protein or a novel viral cofactor surface protein mediating attachment.",
