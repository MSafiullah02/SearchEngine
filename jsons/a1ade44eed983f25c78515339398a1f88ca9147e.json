Additionally, the patient was off his home oral sulfonylureas for multiple days and underwent dialysis sessions making it less likely that the continued effects of oral hypoglycemic agents was the cause of his seizures. The patient was persistently febrile throughout admission possibly related to the cytokine storm so frequently seen in COVID 19. Lumbar puncture would have been a useful diagnostic tool, unfortunately however the patient died before lumbar puncture could be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f arranged.
