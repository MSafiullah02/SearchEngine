The virus life cycle can be described in analogy with a businessman\u2019s life; the entry to his way to work, the genome replication to his task at work, and the exit to his way home. The first stage is entry. Entry involves attachment, in which a virus particle encounters the host cell and attaches to the cell surface, penetration, in which a virus particle reaches the cytoplasm, and uncoating, in which the virus sheds its capsid. Following the uncoating, the naked viral genome is utilized for gene expression and viral genome replication. Finally, when the viral proteins and viral genomes are accumulated, they are assembled to form a progeny virion particle and then released extracellularly. Virion assembly and the release from the cell constitute the exit.",

The attachment factor on the cell surface recruits and holds the virus particles, thereby facilitating the interaction of the viral particle with the entry receptor.\nIn fact, glycoaminoglycans, such as heparins, serve as the attachment factor for diverse viruses, revealing the broader specificity of the attachment factors (Table 3.1\n). Unlike attachment factors, viral receptors, upon binding to the virus particles, promote the penetration of virus particles into cells. Further, the viral receptors are virus-specific and more importantly, determine cell tropism. For example, CD4\n1\nis specifically recognized by HIV, which infects CD4-expressing T lymphocytes.\n",

            "text": "Almost all viral receptors for the major human pathogenic viruses have been identified during the past three decades (Box 3.1\n). Advances in molecular biology made since the 1970s played a critical role for the discovery. Importantly, a few intriguing points stand out regarding the attributes of viral receptors. First, the molecular nature of the viral receptors is quite diverse, ranging from glycoproteins to phospholipids (see Table 3.1). Even the carbohydrate moiety of membrane glycoproteins is utilized as the viral receptor. For instance, sialic acid\n3\nresidue of glycans is the entry receptor for influenza virus. Second, most of the viral entry receptors have their own cellular functions. For instance, the physiological function of LDL receptor, an entry receptor of a certain picornavirus, is to uptake LDL particles into cells, while epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an entry receptor of a certain herpesvirus, is an EGFR (Fig. 3.2\n). In other words, viruses subvert the cellular proteins that have their physiological functions, and utilize them as entry receptors. Third, many of the viral receptors belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as CD4 and CAR (see Fig. 3.2). Fourth, some viruses require coreceptors for their entry, in addition to the main receptors for entry. For example, HIV requires chemokine receptors, such as CCR5 or CXCR4, as a coreceptor for efficient entry (see Fig. 17.4).Box 3.1Strategies to Discovery Viral ReceptorWhat are the experimental approaches to unveil viral receptors on the cell surface of the susceptible cells? Three experimental methods have been successfully used. The first approach is to identify the receptors by biochemical purification of cellular proteins on the cell surface that bind to the viral antireceptors (ie, viral structural proteins). Affinity purification of plasma membrane proteins using the viral structural proteins as a ligand is feasible. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation of plasma membrane proteins that bind to the viral structural protein could lead to many candidate proteins in SDS\u2013PAGE gel. Subsequently, each protein band on the gel is subjected to mass spectroscopy (eg, MALDI-TOF) for identification. The second approach is to use monoclonal antibodies\n2 (Mab) against plasma membrane proteins. It exploits the fact that an antibody specific to the receptor could block the entry. A set of the Mab is prepared against the plasma membrane of the susceptible cell in the first place. Then, each individual Mab is tested for its ability to block the viral infection. If the virus infection is blocked by a specific Mab, the ligand for the Mab is a potential candidate for the viral receptor. Ultimately, the ligand can be identified by immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectroscopy. The third approach is to identify the receptor by functional cloning, which exploits the cDNA expression library. An individual cDNA of the library is transfected into a nonsusceptible cell, then tested as to whether the cell becomes infected. This method necessarily involves high-throughput robotics, as the human cDNA library is composed of over 30,000 genes. Recently, this modern technology has been successfully implemented to clone the HCV receptor. Once the potential molecules for the viral receptors are identified by one of above three approaches, the functionality of the receptors needs to be validated. This validation is to confirm whether the cDNA transfection to a nonsusceptible cell is necessary and sufficient to convert the nonsusceptible cell to a susceptible cell.\n",

Thus, cell tropism\n4\nis largely determined by the receptor. For instance, the presence of CD4 in T helper lymphocyte confers the susceptibility to HIV infection. A HeLa cell that is otherwise resistant to HIV infection becomes susceptible to HIV infection if CD4 is experimentally expressed. On the other hand, the viral proteins that recognize the receptors are ones on the surface of virus particles. In the case of enveloped viruses, the envelope glycoproteins on the viral envelope bind to the receptors. For instance, gp120 of the HIV virion particle binds to the CD4 molecule of the target cells (see Fig. 17.4). In case of naked viruses, capsid proteins may directly bind to the receptor. For instance, the fiber protein of the adenovirus particle binds to the CAR\n5\nmolecule on the target cells.",

            "text": "\nReceptor-mediated endocytosis: Although some viruses, as described above, penetrate into the cytosol directly through the plasma membrane, most viruses depend on endocytic uptakes, a process termed receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 3.3B). Following the engagement of viral particles on the receptor, the virus particle-receptor complex triggers the endocytosis by forming a coated pit on the plasma membrane, leading to endosome formation. As a result, the virus particle becomes located inside the endosome. The next step is to breakdown the endosome to penetrate to the cytoplasm. The process of endosome breakdown differs whether enveloped or not. For enveloped viruses, the membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane triggered by acidic pH at early endosome causes the endosome breakdown. More precisely, the fusion peptide embedded on the envelope glycoprotein becomes exposed (ie, activated) as a consequence of conformational change upon low pH; then the fusion is triggered by the fusion peptide (Box 3.2\n). For nonenveloped naked viruses, the endosome lysis is induced by one of the capsid proteins. In other words, membrane fusion is the mechanism of penetration for envelope viruses (see Fig. 3.3B), while membrane lysis is the mechanism of penetration for nonenveloped viruses (Fig. 3.3C).Box 3.2Fusion peptideThe entry of enveloped viruses into the cell involves membrane fusion between the plasma membrane and the viral envelope. Membrane fusion promotes the penetration of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. A question is how is membrane fusion, which is seemingly a difficult biochemical reaction, carried out? A short answer to this question is that the viral envelope proteins (eg, fusion proteins) harbor a \u201cfusion peptide,\u201d that triggers the membrane fusion. How does the fusion peptide promote membrane fusion? The fusion protein, which is intrinsically \u201cmetastable,\u201d is present in its prefusion conformation in the virion particles. In this state, the fusion peptides are buried inside the viral fusion proteins. Various triggers, such as acidic pH and receptor binding, induce conformational rearrangements, resulting in the anchoring of the fusion peptide in the juxtaposing cellular membrane. Anchoring leads to concurrent formation of a complementary amphipathic domain in the prehairpin extended intermediates. These newly exposed domains are unstable and refold to form more energetically favorable structure. The enthalpy associated with these conformational changes forces mixing of the outer leaflet of the viral membrane with the outer layer of the cellular membrane, resulting in formation of the \u201chemifusion\u201d stalk. The inner leaflet of the lipid bilayers then come into contact and begin mixing, opening a pore (fusion pore) between viral and cellular membranes as the trimeric structures refold into a highly stable postfusion conformation.\nIt is worth noting some features of membrane fusion. First, only one viral factor (ie, the fusion protein) drives membrane fusion, but no cellular factors are involved in membrane fusion. This feature contrasts with that of budding, which also involves membrane fusion. Specifically, numerous cellular factors of the MVBs pathway are involved in budding (see Box 3.4). Secondly, membrane fusion, which is essentially the mixing of two lipid bilayers, is thermodynamically driven. In other words, membrane fusion is accompanied with the conformational changes of the fusion protein that is poised to change from a metastable prefusion state to a highly stable postfusion state.",

Thus, no specific exit mechanism is necessary, because the cell membrane that traps the assembled virus particles are dismantled. Examples of naked viruses are polyomavirus (ie, SV40) and adenovirus. By contrast, in cases of enveloped viruses, envelopment, a process in which the capsids become surrounded by lipid bilayer, takes place prior to the release. With respect to the relatedness of the capsid assembly to the envelopment, two mechanisms exist. First, the envelopment can proceed after the completion of capsid assembly (Fig. 3.9A\n). In this sequential mechanism, the fully assembled capsids are recruited to the membrane by interaction of the viral capsids with viral envelope glycoprotein. Examples of this include herpesvirus and hepatitis B virus. Alternatively, the envelopment can occur simultaneously with the capsid assembly (Fig. 3.9B). Retrovirus is the representative of this coupled mechanism.",

Most enveloped viruses are released extracellularly via exocytosis\n10\n; often, this process is also called budding, as an analogy of buds in plants. Via budding, the envelopment proceeds in a linked manner with extracellular release. Then a question that arises is how mechanistically is budding triggered? The clue for this was revealed by the identification of a peptide motif termed late (L) domain,11\nwhich is instrumental in triggering the budding process (Box 3.3\n). For instance, the retroviral Gag protein encodes \u201cPTAP\u201d motif as a late domain. Briefly, Gag protein, via its late domain, recruits cellular factors involved in the multivesicular bodies\n12\n(MVBs) pathway and subverts the MVB pathway for budding. After all, it is intriguing to learn how viruses exploit cellular mechanisms to produce their own progeny extracellularly.\nBox 3.3Late DomainLate domain, which was first discovered in the Gag polyproteins of retroviruses and M (matrix) proteins of rhabdoviruses, is involved in the budding process of the enveloped viruses. It is composed of four amino acid residues (ie, PTAP, PPPY, and PPEY) encoded in either the rhabdovirus matrix protein or the p6 subdomain of HIV Gag polyprotein (panel A). Intriguingly, a substitution mutation of the late domain motif results in virions attached to the plasma membrane without being released, as if the viral release is blocked at a late stage of budding, a phenotype that is reflected in the nomenclature. It was found that the late domains are involved in recruiting cellular factors involved in the MVBs pathway (panel B). For instance, PTAP motif is critical for the interaction of Gag polyprotein with Tsg101,13\nwhich is a component of ESCRT-I.14\nImportantly, the budding of retrovirus particles is topologically equivalent to MVB biogenesis: in both cases budding is directed away from the cytoplasm. In other words, the retroviral late domains mediate the viral egress from the plasma membrane by coopting the cellular machinery for MVB biogenesis.\n",

            "text": "Viruses, being intracellular parasites, rely on hosts for their propagation. Through evolution, viruses have acquired the abilities to subvert host functions to comply with their needs. In this regard, similarities are notable with respect to entry, penetration, assembly, and exit stages of the virus life cycle. In fact, many steps in the virus life cycle have been extensively studied in the past three decades. Nevertheless, some novel steps in virus life cycles have only begun to be unraveled. In particular, cell\u2013cell transmission (Box 3.4\n) is one novel mechanism that draws significant attention, because of its implication in viral pathogenesis. It is hoped that our better understanding on cell-to-cell spread could be exploited for the treatment of chronic viral diseases, such as AIDS and viral hepatitis.Box 3.4Cell\u2013Cell TransmissionIt was believed that viruses could infect neighboring cells only by being released extracellularly from the infected cells. In contrast to this belief, a novel mechanism has been described, in which a virus could infect the neighboring cell without being released. This new mode of infection is termed cell\u2013cell transmission or cell-to-cell spread. Four distinct modes of cell\u2013cell transmission mechanisms have been described. First, cell\u2013cell transmission is mediated by plasma membrane fusion between two cells. The viral capsids are transmitted from an infected cell to uninfected cells without being enveloped. This mode of cell\u2013cell transmission is described in retrovirus and herpesvirus. Second, cell\u2013cell transmission occurs across a tight junction.15\nThe virus exits basolaterally from an infected cell and is trapped between the infected and uninfected cell membranes at the tight junctions. Using viral entry receptors on the target cell, virions enter the uninfected target cells. This mode of cell\u2013cell transmission is described in herpesvirus and HCV. Third, cell-to-cell spread occurs across a neural synapse. Virions, either mature or incomplete (naked core), assemble in either the postsynaptic or presynaptic cell depending on the virus, and either bud through the membrane into the synaptic space or are released from synaptic vesicles into the cleft. Virions then either fuse directly with the opposing synaptic cells or are endocytosed. Rhabdovirus, herpes viruses, and paramyxoviruses move across neural synapses. Fourth, cell\u2013cell transmission occurs across a virological synapse. Immune cells can be polarized via cell contact, which is termed an immunological synapse.16\nLikewise, an infected cell can polarize viral budding toward the receptor-expressing target cell in a structure called a \u201cvirological synapse.\u201d Virions bud from the infected cell into a synaptic cleft, from which they fuse with the target cell. HIV and HTLV-1, lymphotropic retrovirus, are examples for this mode of viral transmission.\nWhat is the advantage of cell\u2013cell transmission? It facilitates the viral spread from infected cell to uninfected neighboring cells via direct contact without diffusion. More importantly, the viruses associated with cells are physically protected from neutralizing antibodies. In fact, cell\u2013cell transmission was uncovered by an experiment characterizing the neutralizing antibodies-resistant viral transmission. Notably, cell\u2013cell transmission was found only in enveloped viruses, but not in naked viruses. Perhaps, cell\u2013cell transmission is useless for naked viruses, where a bulk of virion is abruptly released upon cell lysis.",
