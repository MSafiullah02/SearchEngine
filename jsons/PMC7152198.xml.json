Until recently there has been little concern about the health of persons emigrating from countries like the USA despite their capacity to spread disease. The impact of migrants returning to low-income countries with a communicable disease is starting to receive greater attention as sending countries study the epidemiology of disease within their own countries. For example, Mexico reports that the greatest risk factor for HIV infection among rural Mexicans is migration to the USA. Return visits to the country of origin are also an important consideration. A study in the United Kingdom demonstrated that children who were second-generation migrants of South Asian ethnic origin had a higher risk of TB than their Caucasian counterparts. One risk factor explaining this was frequent visits to their countries of out-migration, i.e. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.12\nBox 100.1\nlists what travels with humans as they travel into new regions.13\nBox 100.1What travels with humans as they travel into new regions?\n1.Pathogens in or on the body.2.Microbiological flora.3.Vectors on the body.4.Immunological sequelae of past infections.5.Vulnerability to infections.6.Genetic makeup.7.Cultural preferences, customs, behavioural patterns, technology.8.Luggage and whatever it contains.\nTaken from Wilson.13",

            "text": "The quarantine-associated historical basis of migration health practices in high-income country settings has ensured that much of the interest in health and migration has been directed towards communicable diseases,36 commonly on those diseases differentially prevalent between the migrant and host population, TB being one such disease.37 The case study in Box 100.2\nhighlights the challenges and issues raised by TB in a migrant community in a high-income, low-TB-burden setting, in this case, the USA.Box 100.2Case studyIn August 2004, a 24-year-old Guatemalan immigrant was referred to one of the authors (ELZ) after presenting to a rural Pennsylvania community health centre with a 4-week history of cough, night sweats, fever, decreased appetite, and 7 lb weight loss (from 106 to 99 lb). He had been living in the USA for 10 months while working at a factory and living with six unrelated individuals.The patient had an unremarkable past medical history and denied any substance abuse or medication use. His family history was notable in that his father, an alcoholic, had died in Guatemala in 2002 of active pulmonary TB while being treated. According to the patient, his father had been non-compliant with his treatment for TB. The estimated burden of TB in Guatemala was 77 per 100,000 in 2002 (cf. five in the USA).38\nChest radiograph showed infiltrates in both lungs with a predominance in the left upper lung field. Marked pleural thickening was noted in the left apex. Cavities were seen in the right upper lobe with associated volume loss.The patient was employed in a local factory in which the main workplace was a very large open warehouse. The work created a great deal of dust so that all employees wore masks and goggles while working. The employees took all breaks and ate all meals in a common break room. The small break room had no windows and the doors were closed at all times to minimize the dust entering the room.Because of his respiratory distress and overall debilitated condition, the patient was hospitalized and treated initially with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Sputum smear microscopy results were reported as \u2018loaded AFB\u2019, at which time the initial antibiotics were discontinued and treatment was begun with rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. He was discharged from the hospital on day three to be isolated at home. Nurses from the Department of Health visited the patient in the hospital and initiated directly observed therapy immediately after his discharge.Within one week of beginning antituberculous treatment, the patient was asymptomatic. A DNA probe for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive on day eight and sputum culture was positive at 4 weeks. Sputum culture revealed the sample to be susceptible to all first-line TB medications. Sputum smears remained positive (\u2018numerous AFB\u2019) on day 60 after treatment was initiated, and his culture remained positive at 8 weeks of therapy, finally becoming negative at week nine. Because of the cavitation on his chest radiograph and his positive culture at 8 weeks of therapy, the continuation phase of therapy was extended to 7 months for a total of 9 months of treatment.Within days, Pennsylvania Department of Health nurses initiated testing of contacts beginning with household contacts and frequent visitors, proceeding to co-workers at the index case's place of employment and contacts in the hospital and community health centre. In March 2005, the nurses initiated a second round of testing for those contacts that had previously tested negative. Three additional people were tested shortly afterwards.The results of contact testing produced a higher than expected rate of infection, implying a highly infectious case. Of the 307 individuals tested, 182 were TST positive (Table 100.1\n), 117 were negative and eight did not have the test read. All six household contacts and 80 of all other close contacts had a positive TST. Seventy per cent of co-workers from the same shift and 51% of workers from different shifts were also positive. None of the healthcare workers who provided testing and treatment were TST-positive.",

However, little attention has been paid to the problem of TB linked with migration in low-income country settings, both internal and international. Compared to the difference in TB prevalence and incidence rates between low- and high-income countries, the difference between low-income countries is often less dramatic. For example, the estimated new smear-positive pulmonary TB incidence rates for Bangladesh, India, and Nepal at 102, 75, and 81 per 100,000, respectively, show little difference.45 However, in the urban areas of low-income countries, where most migrants live, the risk of TB transmission and infection is higher than the estimated national averages. A recently conducted survey of risk of TB infection in India found that infection rates in urban areas were consistently 1.5\u20132 times higher than in rural areas in all four zones of the country.46 Therefore, the issues relating to migration between and within low-income, high-TB-burden countries are significantly different than those related to migration from low- to high-income countries.",

Referral can be within the same district where the medical college is located, an adjacent district, a further district within the same state, or even a district in another state. Patients will migrate large distances to places where they perceive they will receive high-quality care, e.g. at medical colleges. The process of \u2018referral for treatment\u2019 across large distances presents major challenges to TB control programmes in order for them to provide seamless care for such patients. The risk of such patients defaulting post-diagnosis and prior to treatment is high unless a mechanism for referring them for treatment is being implemented by the TB control programme. In 2005, the RNTCP piloted such a referral for treatment in two states of India and demonstrated that it was possible to implement such a mechanism under programme field conditions in a low-income setting and provide seamless care to patients. The programme is now in the process of scaling the mechanism across the country and piloting an electronic referral for treatment information system. A similar system for referral of migrant patients undergoing treatment for active TB disease (TBNet) while migrating throughout the United States or from the USA to another country has been functioning since 1996.64\n",

In addition, the usefulness of screening for TB among immigrants and the rationale for investing large amounts of money in a low-prevalence country have been questioned.69 To be effective, the management of health issues resulting from population mobility will require a much closer integration of national and global health initiatives for both infectious and non-infectious disease conditions.70 Certainly the advent of a TB vaccine, new medications with a shorter treatment period, and better diagnostic tools will find immediate application for use with international and intranational migrants.",
