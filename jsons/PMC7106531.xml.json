            "text": "Acute respiratory infections represent one of the major public health concerns. Among these respiratory infections, pneumonia causes about 15% (1 million) of infectious and non-infectious deaths of children under 5 every year and represents the leading infectious cause of death worldwide among this age group [1]. In general population, respiratory viruses are responsible for most of the acute respiratory infections and several risk factors including HIV infection, have been associated with severe acute respiratory infections [[2], [3], [4]]. Data from original studies have shown that irrespective of antiretroviral therapy, morbidity and mortality from acute respiratory infections remains higher in HIV positive individuals than HIV negative individuals [5,6]. Evidence suggest that the burden, in term of deaths, of respiratory viral infections like influenza is higher in Africa compared to other regions [7]. This burden can be fuelled by HIV infection in Africa where about 70% of all HIV positive individuals resided in 2016 [8]. Estimating the burden of respiratory infections in HIV-positive patients in Africa is therefore crucial for guiding health decision making for efficient control of ARTI in Africa. To date, influenza vaccine is not integrated in the immunization program of almost all African countries [9]. In addition, with the imminent availability of human respiratory syncytial virus vaccines, it is necessary to set priorities for vaccination and management of acute respiratory infections in Africa, and more particularly in people living with HIV.",

Key findings of this review include higher rate of mortality in HIV positive people compared to HIV negative with the burden higher among those aged < 5 years. Another key finding is that in general there was no difference in the viral aetiologies of ARTI between HIV positive and HIV negative people, except for Rhinovirus which was less associated with HIV infection.",

            "text": "As for other communicable and for non-communicable diseases, HIV positive individuals with ARTI have a higher risk of death compared to HIV negative individuals. The explanation lies globally in the immune response and on how work antiretroviral therapy. Immune response in HIV positive patients with ARI may include low levels of antibodies, low level of CD4 + T cell, and other potential immunological dysfunctions that may promote increased mortality in this group of patients [[54], [55], [56]]. The specific pathogenesis that may explain the association between HIV infection and the increased risk of death in patients with acute respiratory infections is not well understood. Unlike our review, studies conducted outside Africa suggested that the presence of HIV infection did not influence the clinical outcomes of people with ARTI [[57], [58], [59], [60]]. This difference can be explained by the fact that people living with HIV in Africa compared to developed countries can experience more limited access to healthcare for advanced HIV disease, malnutrition, parasitic diseases, and low antiretroviral treatment coverage [57,58,60]. Therefore, in an African context, the higher risk of death in people with HIV can not only be explained by HIV infection itself. We found an increased risk of death among children < 5 years. This finding is close to that of general population of children. Indeed, ARTI have a disproportionate effect on children younger than 5 years with increased risk of death and disability-adjusted life-years [61]. The increased mortality among this population may be related to the immaturity of their immune response compared to adults, especially in the case of HIV infection [61]. In addition, evidence support that the adherence to antiretroviral therapy is lower in children compared to adults [62,63]. As antiretroviral therapy is a key component to curb the mortality in HIV positive people, children under five with suboptimal observance to antiretroviral therapy, in addition to a weak immune response in the case of ARTI, can therefore present higher risk of death compared to adults.",

Although strategies to curb the burden of ARTI coordinated by the WHO made some advances from 1980 to 1990 toward reducing childhood mortality from LRTI, the HIV epidemic had reduced the efforts made so far [68]. The reduction of morbidity and mortality of ARTI in Africa should not only focus on HIV infection and also requires a multifaceted approach that includes addressing risk factors like smoking, second hand smoking, indoor pollution, undernutrition especially among children under five years old [69]. Strategies to curb the burden among HIV positive individuals can include using viral and conjugate bacterial vaccines to reduce colonization and consequently the microbiological load in the environment of HIV positive individuals [70]. When indicated among HIV-positive individuals, healthcare providers should adhere to guidelines for chemoprophylaxis with cotrimoxazole to prevent among others, respiratory infections among people living with HIV [71,72]. To improve the immunity of HIV positive individuals, routine micronutrient supplements, especially multivitamins can be used. Multivitamins have shown to have benefit in reducing the prevalence of ARTI in HIV positive people [73]. One of the most important point to curb the burden of ARTI is to early initiate antiretroviral treatment among all HIV positive people regardless of CD4 cells count and age as recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) [74]. Antiretroviral treatment has been shown to reduce the frequency of most opportunistic infections and significantly reduce HIV-related mortality, including among people with respiratory tract infections [[57], [58], [59], [60]]. However, implementing this WHO guidelines remain challenging in Africa, a continent with poor human and financial resources and weak healthcare infrastructures [75]. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance resulting from repeated and prophylactic antibiotic use among HIV positive individuals and its clinical impact should be investigated in future studies. Research are also needed to investigate the effectiveness of vaccine for respiratory pathogens among HIV positive individuals.",

First and common to most reviews of this type, we found a high heterogeneity between studies explained by age groups. However, we were unable to investigate other sources due to inconsistency in reporting of covariates throughout included studies. Second, the various UNSD sub-regions in Africa were not proportionally represented in the review, which may hinder the translatability of our findings to the entire continent. Third, all included studies were observational, which could lead to bias because of unmeasured confounders between HIV positive and negative. Nonetheless and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis which has given a clear and accurate estimate of CFR among HIV positive individuals with ARTI compared to HIV-negative with ARTI. It is also the first to investigate association between HIV infection and specific respiratory viral aetiology of ARTI. We searched the biggest electronic databases and used rigorous methodological and statistical procedures to generate our estimates. All studies were assessed as having low to moderate risk of bias in their methodological quality, suggesting that we can be confident in the quality of these estimates. Indeed, the sensitivity analysis including only low risk of bias studies yielded an estimate close to that of crude analysis in CFR analysis. We also considered only studies using polymerase chain reaction as diagnostic method of viral aetiologies of ARTI.",
