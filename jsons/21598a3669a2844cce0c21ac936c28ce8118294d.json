            "text": "Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has garnered global attention due to its rapid transmission, which has infected more than two million people worldwide. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the crucial interventions to control virus spread and dissemination. Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals. However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results. As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments. This review aims to provide a concise yet extensive collation of current immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2, while discussing the strengths, limitations and applications of antibody detection in SARS-CoV-2 research and control.",

With the discovery of The genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is adapted from GenBank accession number: MN908947, is characterized by sequence alignment against two representative members of the betacoronavirus genus. The entire genome sequence is \u223c30 kilobases (kb) long. the virus, numerous diagnostic assays using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) were developed (3) . qRT-PCR is the reference standard for diagnosing infections with high sensitivity and accuracy in the Acute phase of illness. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in both throat and nasal swabs of infected individuals by qRT-PCR, which becomes almost undetectable by 14 days post-illness onset (pio) (or symptom onset) (8, 9) (Figure 2) . Apart from being costly and time consuming to perform, false negative results may arise due to improper handling of nucleic acid samples, inadequate and variable sampling resulting in insufficient viral genetic material at the point of detection (after 14 days pio), or biological variation on when viral RNA is detectable by qRT-PCR (10, 15) . With the limitations of qRT-PCR, immunoassays may offer another FIGURE 2 | Schematic illustration on the window period of detection for either viral RNA or antibodies in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (boxed in pink) in throat or nasal swab of patients are typically undetectable by 14 day post illness onset (pio) (8, 9) . SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (boxed in blue): IgM is detectable as early as 3 days pio, and peaks between 2 and 3 weeks pio (10, 11) . IgM response was still detectable after more than 1 month pio (12) . Both IgA and IgG are present as early as 4 days pio, and peaks after 2 weeks pio in serum samples (10, 11, 13, 14) . There are currently no reports on the presence of these SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in the later phase pio, as indicated by dotted lines. This depicts the importance of serological studies to identify individuals with current or prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 that went undetected, by testing for either IgM, IgG, or IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

One study has reported that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM is still present in the serum after 1 month pio (12) . SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, on the other hand, can be present as early as 4 days pio, and peak after 17 days pio (10, 11) (Figure 2) . These observations are similar to what was previously reported during a SARS-CoV infection (21) . However, interestingly, one study demonstrated that longitudinal profiling of both antibodies in a population of 63 COVID-19 patients showed no specific chronological order in terms of IgM and IgG seroconversion (10) , which was also observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV and another human coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (22, 23) . In addition, there seems to be no correlation between seroconversion rates with age, gender or time of hospitalization (10) . These findings on SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies seroconversion against the S viral protein suggest the importance to test for both IgM and IgG antibodies to confirm a positive infection.",

Within the S protein antigen, cross-reactivity was observed when samples were tested against SARS-CoV S and S1 subunit proteins, and to a smaller extent, with MERS-CoV S protein ( Table 1) . Interestingly, there was no cross-reactivity with the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV (14) . The high level of crossreactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to the high degree of genetic homology (3, 14, 19) . Furthermore, detailed analysis revealed a highly conserved S2 subunit domain across coronaviruses, which may explain for the cross-reactivity observed with only the S protein of MERS-CoV, and not with the S1 subunit (14, 19) . These data suggest that using an S1 subunit-based immunoassay may be more specific than the entire S antigen for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

Of clinical relevance, these antibodies were also able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, signifying the potential of an immunotherapy-based treatment (20) . While one non-peer reviewed study has shown that RBD-based serological assays are more sensitive than S1 subunit-based assays in identifying antibodies in mild COVID-19 patients (14), other non-peer-reviewed studies have described a lower degree of antibody response to the RBD as compared to full-length S protein, plausibly reflecting the larger number of epitopes present on the larger S antigen (13, 19 ).",

Using SARS-CoV-derived B-cell epitopes that have been experimentally identified from positive B-cell assays (34), 49 out of 298 linear B-cell epitopes have an identical match with SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences without any mutations (3) . Notably, majority of these matches were located at both the S and N viral antigens, with only 4 from the M protein, and none in the E protein (3). On the other hand, 6 conformational B-cell epitopes identified from the same database were located on the S antigen. However, unlike the linear epitopes, none of these mapped identically to the SARS-CoV-2 protein (3). Further mapping the residues of linear B-cell epitopes onto available SARS-CoV S protein structure revealed several regions on the S2 subunit that may allow cross-neutralization of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (3, 35) . In contrast, conformational B-cell epitopes mapped onto the S1 subunit, resulting in very few identical residues within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (3). These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-specific antibodies targeting these discontinuous regions may not be able to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 (3, 36) . As these regions are computationally predicted, serological studies using patient samples are necessary to validate the importance of these regions for serology and in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also remains imperative to identify other SARS-CoV antibodies that may recognize the conformational epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which can greatly reduce the amount of time needed to develop novel neutralizing antibodies.",

To date, two human SARS-CoV-specific antibodies, CR3022 and 47D11, have been shown to recognize SARS-CoV-2 (38, 39) . CR3022 recognizes an epitope along the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, which differs largely at the C-terminus residues to the RBD of SARS-CoV (38) . Unfortunately, this variation in sequence impacted the ability of CR3022 to crossneutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monoclonal antibody 47D11, on the other hand, targets the RBD along the S1 subunit of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with similar affinities, thereby enabling cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 infection (39) .

The availability of serological assays that target a diverse range of viral antigen has no doubt assisted in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Essentially, data generated through serological studies can greatly aid in supplementing the results from qRT-PCR, as well as contribute to seroepidemiology, which has been shown to help in the design of virus elimination programs (52) . Moving forward, this extensive collation of the current immunoassays against SARS-CoV-2 will provide insights toward monoclonal antibodies discovery and characterization for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",
