This diagnostic may help ABSTRACT Background: During the past two decades, three novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged to cause international human epidemics with severe morbidity. CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals. A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats. Objective: To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Study design and Results: We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with the 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4\u00d7102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested. To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market. The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types. Conclusions: This assay can be used for detection and identification of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.",

According to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics website [7], as of April 9, 2020 there were more than 470 molecular and immunological assays in the development pipeline. However, few diagnostics are available or being developed to detect other animal CoVs that may jump species to man.

Although it becomes less expensive each consecutive year, the cost is still very high and the procedure includes time-consuming complicated library preparations and data processing. Hence, we posit that combined screening strategies are the most costeffective way to identify new CoVs. We recommend employing novel coronavirus surveillance among people whose occupations or recreation cause them to have prolonged or frequent exposure to animals. We recommend screening them periodically, when healthy, for novel CoV nasal carriage and whenever they develop an acute respiratory illness. This surveillance might first include employing our pan-CoV assay and other pan-viral assays. When a novel virus is detected, the surveillance team might look for that same virus among the workers' animals. Having confirmed a novel virus in both an animal worker and his or her animals, further investigations might be employed through cell culture, full genome sequencing, and if indicated, seroepidemiology of both the worker and the animals.",

The thermal profile included incubation at 55\u00b0C for 30 min for reserve transcription, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f followed by incubation at 94\u00b0C for 2min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Following the reverse transcription, amplification was performed in the CFX PCR System (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the following program: 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15s, 53.4\u00b0C for 30s and 68\u00b0C for 1min; a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5min; and holding at 4\u00b0C. The conventional PCR for second step was carried out in 25 L volume containing 1 L of first RT-PCR product, 2.5 L 10X PCR Buffer (no magnesium chloride), 0.75 L 50mM magnesium chloride, 0.5 L dNTP mix (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 1 L of each primer (pan-CoV_inF and pan-CoV_R), 0.25 L Platinum\u2122 Taq DNA Polymerase, and enough nuclease-free water for a final volume of 25 L for each reaction.

To avoid possible contamination, positive and negative controls were contained in each run of the assay. The PCR products were kept at 4\u00b0C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. Amplification products were electrophoresed and visualized on a 2% agarose gel together with a 100 bp DNA ladder at 120V for 30min.
