            "text": "During COVID-19 nearly everyone around the globe was monitoring the situation on a daily, if not hourly, basis by tracking a set of numbers that were reported by different institutions through multiple platforms: either official, or informal. Irrespective of the sources from which the data was pulled, many researchers, reporters and professionals made the effort to represent the data in different ways in an effort to explain: what happened, what was happening, and what might happen; with the hope of seeing a sign of slowing down the spread of the virus (SARS-CoV-2). A subset of these reported numbers included: the confirmed cases, number of deaths, number of recovered cases along with the number of tests being carried out by each country. Each of these numbers (metrics) was able to reveal only one side of the reality ignoring the messages that might come from other metrics (numbers). Focusing only on one single metric to reflect on the situation opened the doors for emergent opinions, theories speculations, and even confusion among the professionals before the public. In fact, all of these efforts to explain and describe the situation through the same available numbers did not manage to see clearly or shed the light on the performance and the efficiency of the country's health system in dealing with the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. It was evident that none of these numbers could reconstruct the full picture about the virus spread behavior nor about the capability and capacity of the health system in dealing with the pandemic. A combined metric should have been developed to best reflect the performance of the health system during the crisis. In this paper, a signal to noise ratio like index, snr was introduced in an attempt to evaluate the efficiency of the health system as well as the effectiveness of the interventions taken by the stakeholders in an effort to control the virus spread during any health-related crisis. Using this proposed index (snr ), it was possible to carry out a data-driven comparison among different countries in their efforts of dealing with the crisis. The primary focus of this study was to assess the interventions' effectiveness by the decision makers along with the health system's efficiency of the countries that experienced a relatively high pressure and stress on their systems. In this study, 19 countries were selected based on predefined criteria that included: (1) the reported total confirmed cases 1 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The case fatality rate (CFR) is calculated through dividing total number of deaths by the total number of infected people (the diagnosed cases only).

In simple words, the efficiency of a system could be defined as the ratio between the gained value from the system (outputs) and the amount of consumed resources (inputs) to deliver this value. For a complex system; like healthcare that has a high degree of inter-dependency among its components and subsystems, it is not a trivial task to quantify the gained value neither is assessing the consumed resources. Healthcare system resources; however, can be classified into tangible and intangible categories. While the tangible category (quantitative measures) includes: health workers (doctors, nurses, technical and managerial staff), hospital beds, and equipment, the intangible category (qualitative) includes: skills, knowledge and quality of the tangible (nonhuman) resources. Irrespective of which metrics, methods or frameworks are applied to assess the efficiency of the health systems; indubitably few metrics such as: number of hospital beds in 1000 people and number of doctors (or physicians) per 1000 people are not uncommon metrics for assessing the capacity of the healthcare systems in a country [10] .

To reach these criteria, a 2-dimensional graph showing the relationship between the total confirmed cases and the confirmed cases per 1 million people was constructed for a subset of countries, see figure 8 . Accordingly, countries that are in the upper right quadrant of figure 8 were selected for further analysis. These countries have more than 5,000 confirmed cases and more than 200 confirmed cases per million people. Countries that had a relatively small number of confirmed cases were excluded from the selection, because in these countries, the death rate, DR and the recovered rate, RR are particularly poor metrics and not indicative of the real situations due to the lack of proper and frequent testings as well as reporting mechanisms.",

In this group, although the outbreak started earlier for Switzerland than for the other members in this group, it a faced very hard time due to the turbulence created by the spread of the virus. Its snr index even went to the negative zone of the index between 10 th of March till 24 th of March. Afterward, it managed to control the situation and ever since it has been going up to a relatively high snr index reaching a level of 20 dB around the 2 nd of April and maintaining its stabilized position at the later stage of the outbreak.

Indubitably, Germany was the most prepared country in the whole world in facing such pandemic with a strong health system (see section 1.2) and well planned interventions on all levels, time-wise and clarity. Germany's snr curve reached its highest level at around 30 dB by the 23 rd of March marking the shortest period of time that any country had to go through to stabilize its system.

Episode 0 is characterized by an adhoc and rather delayed intervention from the stakeholders, who were trying to figure out the situation and actions to be taken. The second episode, episode I (unstabilized horizontal), is where the stakeholders had to take more drastic measures to contain the outbreak and to flip the pattern. Many countries, as will be shown in the next sections, could not make it easily due to a lack of testing kits and facilities, delayed interventions, strained healthcare system and more. Countries like the benchmark group managed to survive this episode I relatively quickly ranging from 1 to 2 weeks during March 2020.

To stay in the positive zone of the snr curve, the recovery rate, RR has to outperform the pace of the death rate, DR as per the definition of the snr index. Both countries shared the same characteristics of the snr curve where they spent a relatively shorter time during episode 0, while spending a longer time in episode I than any other country in any group. Accordingly, it can be concluded that both countries had to release some cases as quick as possible to free spots for the critical cases which eventually increased the recovered rate, RR and hence resulted in a positive snr index. On the other side, the figure shows a relatively similar behavior of the snr curve for both Egypt and India. Although both countries did not report any difficulty in their efforts facing the outbreak, neither country managed to come out from episode I till mid April. This kind of conflicting behavior opens once again a discussion around the reliability of the reported data. As for Israel, as mentioned in a previous section, it did not face difficulty in its fight against the pandemic due to its health system readiness and capacity, see section 1.2. The snr curve with its four episodes occurred during an extremely short time in the case of Israel marking the shortest snr curve cycle among all selected countries for this study. China's curve clearly is showing a dominant episode III part where stability was reached before all other countries.",

The figure reveals that the interventions such as: movement restriction, public health measures and social distancing took place as early March. With its strong health system in terms of hospital capacity and health workers availability, see section 1.2, Germany was able not only to stay in the positive zone of the snr curve during episodes 0 and I, but also to rise up quickly during episode II to reach episode III between 23-24 of March marking the fastest nation to find its stability and maintain its positive position until the writing of this study, see section 4.4.
