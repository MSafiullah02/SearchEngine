When-as stressed in the previous chapter-adaptive stress responses such as the UPR and the DDR fail to repair molecular damage and, thus, fail to restore cellular homeostasis, cells generally promote and undergo an RCD as a means to preserve the homeostasis of the whole organism ( Fig. 19.1) . Doubtlessly, one of the hottest topics in modern biomedicine is the research in the field of RCD. In fact, it is the intersection between cell death as a major source of DAMP emission and execution of innate/adaptive immune responses that is central not only to maintenance and restoration of homeostasis but also, unfortunately, to pathogenesis of many human diseases and-as a consequential necessity-to the development of novel therapeutics. So, let's start here with a brief glance at the background of this topic.",

The character and the intensity of a cell's death can vary. In principle, cells may die either individually or in groups in an accidental manner, that is, in the form of an ACD or may succumb to an RCD. Accidental cell death is caused by extreme insults such as overwhelming thermal, chemical, or mechanical/physical injuries, a typical example being freezing and thawing procedures. As previously When stress responses fail to repair molecular damage, cells generally promote and undergo a regulated cell death to preserve homeostasis of the whole organism. DAMPs are generated and emitted during stress responses and different forms of regulated cell death (associated with increasing degree of immunogenicity) in relation to the intensity of injurious stimuli. Sources: Refs. [3, 4] mentioned, this kind of cell death is entirely uncontrolled and virtually immediate. By contrast, RCD is caused by low or moderate insults as can be observed, for example, during various kinds of infections or pathological tissue reperfusion.",

By definition, RN is an immunogenic form of cell death because of the inevitable rupture of the plasma membrane and consequent release of large amounts of constitutive DAMPs. Such a process does not happen during apoptosis as a low degree-immunogenic form of cell death because, here, the plasma membrane integrity remains preserved. Expectedly, therefore, the emission of DAMPs by apoptotic cells is weak or even null. Importantly, several different pathways of RN have been recently described, typically associated with variable intensity of emission of inducible DAMPs. Thus, in the perspective of the book, their different mechanistic formations deserve a brief but clear description, before resuming this exciting topic of immunogenicity at the end of the chapter.",

And it was the German biologist Walther Flemming, a founder of cytogenetics, who first observed the phenomenon under the microscope and called the process chromatolysis [14] . In 1914, the German anatomist Ludwig Gr\u00e4per interpreted Flemming's observations by claiming that \"chromatolysis must exist in all organs in which cells must be eliminated\" [15] .

The process of degeneration varies with the degree of specialization of the cell, with its functional state (e.g., mitosis), with the type of animal and under experimental conditions with the causative agents.

For example, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BAX and BAK. On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins are themselves inhibited by the BH3-only proteins in response to an intrinsic signal. This results in BAX and BAK homo-oligomerization that creates mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation (MMP) associated with formation of membrane pores, releasing mitochondrial cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. Following, cytochrome C triggers a conformational change in apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), resulting in ATP exchange and oligomerization to form a complex, called the \"apoptosome\" that converts pro-caspase-9 to active caspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates the executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, leading to cell death. Caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 are kept in check by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP); however, BAX and BAK also release from mitochondria a protein called second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC, also known as DIABLO) and cytochrome C. The protein SMAC/DIABLO sequesters XIAP, thereby facilitating effector caspase activation (for the original articles, see [25] [26] [27] ).",

Apoptosis can be instigated by two major cellular signalling pathways: an intrinsic pathway that is initiated inside cells by mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors or an extrinsic pathway that is initiated at the cell surface by death receptors that are members of the TNF receptor gene family. The intrinsic pathway is controlled by members of the Bcl-2 protein family such as the BH3-only proteins which, when activated, stimulate pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK that form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane to provide release of cytochrome C. Following, cytochrome C associates with Apaf1 to form an apoptosome that drives activation of caspase-9, which then stimulates caspase-3 and caspase-7. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway can be divided into two paths according to two groups of death receptors. The first group (Fas, TRAILR, DR4, DR5) recruits DISC followed a series of events, that is, caspase-8-mediated activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7. The second group (TNFR1, DR3, DR6) recruits the adaptor protein TRADD that links death receptor to TRAF2, RIPK1, cIAPs, and LUBAC, forming the signalling complex I. Further forms complexes IIa and IIb lead to activation of the caspase cascade that results in apoptosis.

As reviewed [38] , death receptors contain a conserved cytosolic death domain (DD) (for death domain, see Box 19.1). The eight kinds of death receptors have different amino acid sequences that determine ligand specificity, and they can be divided into two groups according to the cytosolic adaptor protein that makes a distinct complex. These death receptors transmit signals from extracellular death ligands across the plasma membrane to engage the intracellular caspase machinery. Such death ligands include Fas ligand (FasL), TNF, and TRAIL (reviewed in [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] ).",

However, these consecutive events are insufficient in type II cells such as hepatocytes and pancreatic \u03b2 cells because of the relatively low levels of DISC in spite of comparable levels of the DISC components. Thus, more often, caspase-8 drives apoptotic execution less directly by cleaving and thereby stimulating the The death domain has initially been characterized as an intracellular homology domain of FAS (Apo-1) and the TNF receptor, which is important for apoptotic signalling in both receptors. Subsequently, several other proteins have been found to interact with the cytoplasmic part of either FAS or the TNF receptor in the region of the death domain. Overexpression of these proteins usually leads to cell death. By profile analysis, it was shown that several other proteins contain regions with significant similarity to the death domain. Interestingly, several of these proteins also work in the context of cell death signalling.

In the extracellular compartment, eATP predominantly functions as a signalling molecule through the activation of purinergic P2 receptors (see also Part II, Sect. 5.3.4.3).

The evolutionarily developed trick of this type of cell death is impressive and unique: engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes before the plasma membrane gets disrupted, namely, the process of efferocytosis, prevents release of large amounts of DAMPs and, thus, avoids immunogenic properties of the dying cell (see Part VI, Sect. 22.6.3.3). Only in certain circumstances, via active secretion of DAMPs or development to secondary necrosis, apoptosis can be associated with minimal/moderate immunogenicity.",

As such, necroptosis is a kinase-mediated cell death that relies on RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of the pseudokinase MLKL ( Fig. 19.4) . Instead of reviewing all details of our current understanding of the necroptosis pathways, some aspects are sketched here that are biased to what in the perspective of the book is considered the most important facts to understand necroptosis as the origin of \"necroinflammation\" and \"necroimmunity\"; the quintessence of this topic in one sentence articulated is \"dying cells actively regulate inflammatory and adaptive immune responses\" [54, 55] .

Simplified scenario model of the necroptotic pathway. Necroptosis can be triggered by engagement of TNF to TNF receptor superfamily (e.g., TNFR1), Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR3 and TLR4), or the DNA receptor DAI. In TNF-induced necroptosis, TNF binds to the TNF receptors and engages a complex formation, which includes TRAF2, cIAP, and RIPK1. RIPK1 recruits and activates RIPK3 that oligomerizes resulting in the formation of the necrosome. RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL which functions as a necroptosis inducer by causing plasma membrane rupture. The concise mechanisms of plasma membrane rupture have yet to be defined. In parallel, phosphorylated MLKL translocates to the nucleus and results in transcription of CXCL1, IL-33, and IL-1\u03b2 which are actively secreted. Engagement of the necrosome can also be a consequence of TLR signalling through TRIF/RIPK3 or DAI signalling through DAI/RIPK3. cIAPs cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein, DAI DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors, dsRNA doublestranded RNA, HMGB1 high mobility group box 1, IL interleukin, MLKL mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, RIPK1/3 receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1/3, TLR Tolllike receptor, TNF tumor necrosis factor, TNFR1 tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, TRADD tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain, TRAF2 tumor necrosis factor-receptorassociated factor 2, TRIF Toll/IL-1(TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-\u03b2.

The enzyme RIPK3 is a homologous kinase of RIPK1 with a similar N-terminal kinase domain and an intermediate domain that can contribute to TNF-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, if overexpressed. RIPK3 also contains an RHIM domain at its C-terminus but lacks the C-terminal death domain compared to RIPK1. RIPK3 kinase activity appears to be essential for necroptosis. The pseudokinase MLKL is another critical mediator of necroptosis and is regarded as the sole and central effector of necroptosis. The protein possesses an N-terminal four-helical bundle domain, which directly or indirectly results in membrane pore formation.",

            "text": "Upon TNF stimulation, RIPK1 and the intracellular adapter molecule TRADD are independently recruited to the TNFR1 by their DD domains to form the TNF receptor complex (denoted as complex I) which essentially prevents necrotic cell death [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] (for complex I, compare its role in apoptosis above in Sect. 19 [62] [63] [64] . Thus, IKK\u03b1-and IKK\u03b2-dependent phosphorylation of RIPK1 prevents its dissociation from the receptor and hence prevents the formation of a cytosolic procell death complex, denoted as complex II. Importantly, upon deubiquitination of RIPK1, pro-caspase-8 may be recruited to this complex via a DD that binds the DD of FADD. This results in the forced proximity of pro-caspase-8 and activation by proteolytic cleavage of the caspases to form a functional caspase-8 homodimer capable of cleaving effector caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, to mediate and execute apoptosis [64] . On the other hand, de-ubiquitylation and particular dephosphorylation may lead to dissociation of RIPK1, allowing it to form the cytosolic pro-cell death complex II. Two types of complex II can be distinguished (IIa and IIb) depending on the composition of complex II and the activity of the proteins therein. Importantly, while complex IIa and IIb induce apoptosis, they can also induce necroptosis if caspase-8 is inactive or absent. In case caspase-8 is inactive or absent, RIPK1 in complex II recruits and activates RIPK3 resulting in the formation of the necrosome. The necrosome formed from complex IIa consists of TRADD, RIPK1, RIPK3, and FADD, while the necrosome resulting from complex IIb lacks TRADD (Fig. 19.4 ) (reviewed in [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] ). The enzyme RIPK3 in the necrosome is present in a phosphorylated manner, and it is not entirely clear to which extent RIPK1 or RIPK3 itself mediates this phosphorylation. However, the necrosome is stabilized by HSP90 and CDC-37, two chaperones that are required for the fully active necrosome activity [74, 75] . As a constitutive binding partner of RIPK3, MLKL is incorporated in the necrosome. Taken together, and as competently argued by Grootjans et al. [7] , \"a working model on the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 emerges where inactive RIPK1 initially exists in a closed conformation at the TNFR1, where its DD and RHIM are unavailable for the formation of pro-cell death complexes. De-ubiquitylation and particular dephosphorylation may open up RIPK1, allowing it to form a cytosolic complex II. Activation of RIPK1 by a still to be discovered mechanism then results in its autophosphorylation and activation. Depending on the availability of caspase-8, activation of RIPK1 then allows either activation of caspase-8 or RIPK3 within complex II, which results in, respectively, apoptosis or necroptosis.\"",

In other words: these recent findings show that viruses such as murine CMV and IAV infections drive DAI association with RIPK3, leading to its activation and necroptosis [81] (Fig. 19 .5).

The enzyme exposes a fourhelical bundle domain upon (1) phosphorylation by RIPK3 in its activation loop and (2) the dephosphorylation of a persistent phosphate residue in the hinge region between the helical bundle and the default protein [83] [84] [85] . Once pMLKL is fully active, it reportedly oligomerizes and binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) located in the plasma membrane. This molecule is a multifunctional lipid that regulates several essential subcellular processes in eukaryotic cells [86, 87] . It has been proposed that pMLKL forms pores in the plasma membrane to mediate plasma membrane rupture [87] , but this remains to be demonstrated in cells or in vivo. Of note, more recent studies provided evidence indicating that MLKL can activate the innate immune receptor NLRP3 in a cell-intrinsic manner [88] . Indeed, these new data emphasize that MLKL-mediated NLRP3 and caspase-1 activation and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2-operating as an inducible DAMP-are a significant determinant of necroptotic-derived inflammatory signals. Notably, however, GSDMD, the pore-forming caspase-1 substrate required for efficient NLRP3triggered pyroptosis and IL-1\u03b2 release, was not essential for MLKL-dependent death or IL-1\u03b2 secretion (for activation of NLRP3, see Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2, and for pyroptosis, see below, Sect. 19.3.4) .",

Activation of MLKL results in the generation of broken, membrane \"bubbles\" with exposed PS that are released from the surface of the otherwise intact cell. A distinct machinery, the so-called endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery, is needed for the formation of these bubbles and acts to sustain survival of the cell when MLKL activation is limited or reversed. Under conditions of necroptotic cell death, ESCRT-III controls the duration of plasma membrane integrity [89] . In other words, the ESCRT-III-mediated plasma membrane repair provides an extension of the time to death during necroptosis. As a consequence of this action of ESCRT-III, cells undergoing necroptosis can express regulatory immunomodulatory molecules such as CXCL1, IL-33, and IL-1\u03b2 and promote antigenic cross-priming of CD8 + T cells [89] [90] [91] [92] (for IL-33, see Part VI, Sect. 22.5.6.4; for cross-priming of CD8 + T cells, see Part VIII, Sects. 31.3.5 and 32.5.4).",

For example, consequent processes such as mitigated acute inflammation \u2192 chronic inflammation or decreased immunogenicity \u2192 tolerogenicity may context-dependently develop.

Oxidation of lipids can occur via three distinct mechanisms: (1) enzymatic oxidation by enzymes such as lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases and cytochrome P450, (2) non-enzymatic, ROS-mediated oxidation, and (3) non-enzymatic, non-free radical oxidation. Each oxidation mechanism leads to generation of specific products with high stereospecificity (for reviews, see [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] ). Major products of lipoxygenase oxidation of PUFAs depend on their substrate and refer to various oxidized molecules including leukotrienes, lipoxins, and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HpETEs). Oxygenation by cyclooxygenases results in the generation of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes, whereas cytochrome P450 generates epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), thromboxanes, and prostacyclins (reviewed in [107, 108] ). Non-enzymatic mechanisms are mediated by ROS that are generated by ROS-producing enzyme systems such as NADPH oxidases and nitric oxide synthases in the presence of transition metal ions (Fe 2+ and Cu 2+ ) and result in a mixture of non-specific stereoisomers (reviewed in [106, 108] ). Moreover, the enzyme myeloperoxidase has also been shown to instigate non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation through the generation of ROS (discussed in [106, 109] ). Notably, by contrast to products of enzymatic lipid oxidation, the products of directly ROS-mediated non-enzymatic processes are regarded to be more toxic and harmful to the host [110] .",

            "text": "The ferroptosis pathway has been recently reviewed in detail [8, 117] and may be best explained by firstly pointing toward homeostatic conditions concerned. Thus, under normal circumstances, free highly reactive intracellular iron is dangerous and therefore bound to ferritin [118, 119] , thereby controlling the oxidative capacity of free iron and the amount of oxygen radicals. For example, heavy chain ferritin was demonstrated to be protective in models of IRI [120] , and the role of iron in AKI has been well established [121] . When the term ferroptosis was first ascribed to the process of iron-catalyzed RN, iron chelation (a type of bonding of ions and molecules to iron ions) was demonstrated to prevent this deadly signal [122] . Also, under homeostatic conditions, the enzyme phospholipid-hydroxyperoxid-glutathione-peroxidase (GPX4 or PHGPx), a selenoprotein, plays an essential role in avoiding irondependent lipid peroxidation which is mediated by a unique enzyme, the arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX). In fact, constitutive ALOX activation is antagonized by GPX4 which employs glutathione (GSH) to reduce H 2 O 2 to GSSG (oxidized glutathione) and H 2 O. Of note, besides recycling by the glutathione reductase, intracellular concentrations of GSH are maintained by the activity of the GSH synthase which requires the substrates glutamine, cysteine, and glycine to function. A glutamate/cystine \"antiporter\" (i.e., a co-transporter involved in secondary active transport of molecules or ions across a membrane) in the plasma membrane referred to as \"system XC-minus\" provides the cells with cystine (Cys-Cys disulfide, Cys 2 ). This amino acid is then intracellularly metabolized to cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for GSH synthesis [123] . Together, these observations show that GPX4-indirectly-inhibits lipid peroxidation and, thus, ferroptosis. On the other hand, the loss or inducible depletion of GPX4 was found to result in lethality, for example, in early embryonic lethality, or in death of neurons or renal tubular cells later during life [100, [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] . It is worth noting here that, under normal conditions, production of ROS as generated in the course of cellular metabolism is kept in check by antioxidative mechanisms operating in the course of the oxidative stress response (see above, Sect. 18.3.3).",

Hence, iron-dependent ALOX-mediated peroxidation of lipids (predominantly PUFAs but also other membrane lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) leads to the production of toxic \"lipid ROS\" (i.e., lipid hydroperoxides and other products) which lead to subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, that is, ferroptosis [100, 115, 129] (Fig. 19.6) . Intriguingly, this ferroptotic pathway-in comparison to the necroptotic path that is regarded as a form of cell suicide-can be seen as a form of \"sabotage\" [96] , where cell death results from disruption of the operation of an essential process leading to death without the involvement of dedicated cell death machinery. No death-promoting molecules are newly up-regulated, no caspases, no kinases whatsoever! Another possibility that may lead to lipid peroxidation and subsequent ferroptosis is the production of ROS in excess as, for example, observed in pathological situations of IRI [130, 131] . In this case, the oxidative stress responses are overcharged to scavenge the free radicals. Involvement of such a mechanism is supported by recent studies providing first evidence that the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 pathway as described above in Sect. 18.3.3.3 diminishes the ferroptotic cell death [132] .",

For the future, it will be interesting to know whether ferroptosis involves the release of large amounts of specific DAMPs (what can be expected) and, if so, whether these are unique to ferroptosis or common across different forms of RN. Notably, induction of ferroptosis is increasingly recognized as a critical form of cell death that may contribute to acute and chronic human diseases, such as IRI following myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke, major neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, that is, disorders associated with significant cell death. Plausibly, this new knowledge has motivated researchers and the pharmaceutical industry to search for safe and effective compounds able to inhibit this form of RN.

Previously, in Part II, Sects. 5.2.3.3 and 5.2.5.2, the inflammasome-forming NOD receptors/sensors and AIM2 receptor have already been briefly introduced. These inflammasome-forming PRMs are known to sense MAMPs derived from a variety of bacteria (e.g., via NLRP3) and viruses (via AIM2) as well as DAMPs emitted during various sterile stressful and injurious conditions. Activation of inflammasome-associated inflammatory caspases promotes cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 to form mature cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. In parallel, these caspases drive cleavage of the pro-pyroptotic factor GSDMD by generating an N-terminal fragment that oligomerizes to form pores on the host cell membrane and cause the lytic demise of the cell. The pyroptotic cell death leads to the release of the IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 inflammatory hallmarks associated with inflammasome activation. According to new notions, the key cytokine IL-1\u03b2 can be regarded as an inducible DAMP (see Part IV, Sect. 14.3.2.3).",

            "text": "In the initial phase of the pyroptotic pathway, the caspases are activated within the inflammasomes whose activation is the consequence of the interaction of their sensors/receptors with MAMPs and/or DAMPs (Fig. 19.7) . Although the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis have not been fully elucidated, it was recently demonstrated that cleavage of GSDMD by these inflammatory caspases is critical for pyroptosis to occur, that is, caspase-1 and caspase-11 in murine macrophages and their human orthologues caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5. Gasdermin D is a member of the GSDM family which is emerging as mediators of RCD in a variety of processes that regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation. The GSDM family of proteins is conserved in vertebrates and comprises, in humans, four paralogous termed GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, and GSDMD [142] . According to current notions, the caspases mentioned above cleave the protein GSDMD releasing its N-terminal domain from inhibition by its C-terminal domain. In fact, evidence suggests that, under homeostatic conditions, the GSDMD C-terminus has an autoinhibitory effect on the intrinsic activity of the pyroptosis-inducing GSDMD N-terminus. This cytotoxic N-terminal fragment is then released and targets/ binds to phospholipids (phosphoinositide and cardiolipin) on the host plasma cell membrane [151] . Importantly, before its migration to the membrane, GSDMD N-terminus transits from a monomer to an oligomer molecule that is initiated by caspase-mediated removal of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Oligomerized GSDMD N-terminus leads to its insertion into the membrane resulting in the GSDMD pore formation. The pores mostly have an inner diameter of 12-14 nm with approximately 16 symmetric protomers. Processed GSDMD N-terminus, via its affinity for cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, may also target and kill intracellular bacteria. 19 .7 Simplified scenario model of the pyroptotic pathway. Pyroptosis is induced by caspases which are activated within inflammasomes, here exemplified by the NLRP3 inflammasome as activated by DAMPs (HMGB1 and ATP) emitted in the course of oxidative tissue injury. In this example of canonical inflammasome activation, HMGB1 triggers TLR4-mediated transcription and translation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1\u03b2/pro-IL18 (priming step), whereas ATP leads indirectly via induction of ion perturbation (K + efflux) to final activation (activation step). Additionally, mitochondria-derived ROS serve as co-activating signal (for further details of activation, see Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2.2). Upon activation, the human inflammatory caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D, releasing the N-terminal domain from the autoinhibitory Gasdermin D-C domain. Activated Gasdermin D-N then binds to lipids in the plasma membrane and forms large pores, leading to release of cellular contents such as mature processed IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 as well as cell death.

Sources: Refs. [9, [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] GSDMD N-terminus pore formation in the host cell leads to pyroptosis to produce apoptotic body-like cell protrusions (\"blebbing\") followed by rapid rupture of the plasma membrane. Notably, the precise mechanism of plasma membrane blebbing and rupture is currently unknown. Importantly, current notion hold that IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, formerly believed to be actively secreted, are released from the cell upon this membrane rupture, probably through those pores (reviewed in [143-146, 151, 152] ).",

One hallmark of inflammasomes certainly refers to their role in the execution of pyroptosis. Thus, detecting and responding to microorganisms that invade host cells is critical for clearing life-threatening infections. Again, as with necroptosis, pyroptosis passively releases large amounts of constitutive Class IA DAMPs as well as inducible IIIB-1 DAMPs in the form of processed bioactive IL-1\u03b2 which all together, via amplification of further innate immune processes and promotion of subsequent adaptive immune responses, mediate robust antibacterial and antiviral defense programs. An example is illustrated in Fig. 19 .8. However, the \"bitter pill is just around the corner\": uncontrolled pyroptosis associated with excessive or chronic-repetitive emission of DAMPs (constitutive and inducible DAMPs) can become detrimental in promoting acute hyperinflammationbased disorders such as ARD and SIRS or chronic autoinflammatory diseases. Hence, to prevent such disasters, further research work is necessary to fully understand the exact mechanisms of pyroptosis and its precise roles in vivo. Future success in this field will allow to explore and design effective novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing this dark side of DAMP emission.",

According to Galluzzi et al. [10] , the term MPT is commonly employed to indicate an abrupt increase in the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to small solutes, resulting in dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (which is required for ATP synthesis and several other mitochondrial functions), massive water intake, and osmotic organelle breakdown. This form of RCD generally manifests with necrotic morphological features. \"Parthanatos\" is a portmanteau term (parthanatos) derived from par (for poly (ADP-ribose [PAR] polymer) and Thanatos, the personification of death in Greek mythology [153, 154] . Of particular interest is that parthanatos does not obligatorily require caspases for its execution, a feature that distinguishes this cell death form from caspase-dependent apoptosis. Notably, the identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the parthanatic pathway has revealed that the nature of this cell death is unique and separate from those of other forms of cell death such as apoptosis, necroptosis, or ferroptosis. Extensive details of molecular mechanisms involved in MTP-RN and parthanatos are only beginning to be elucidated, and various aspects continue to be a matter of debate. Because of this, both subroutines of RCD are only briefly touched here.",

This death pathway results from relatively severe perturbations of intracellular redox and/or Ca 2+ homeostasis. According to current notions, the MPT-RN ensures a conformational change in a multiprotein complex assembled at the juxtaposition between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, the so-called permeability transition pore complex (PTPC). The precise molecular composition of the PTPC complex is not entirely clear but is discussed to show a degree of context dependency [35, 155] . Apart from this lack of knowledge, it seems to be evident that MPT results in a rapid drop of intracellular ATP availability, driving a peculiar form of RCD. Together, these remarkable findings and others not mentioned here indicate that mitochondria play a fundamental role in the signalling pathways underlying MPT-driven RN (reviewed in [10] ).",

Such cellular injuries include stimuli which can induce DNA damage directly, such as ROS (e.g., H 2 O 2 ), alkylating agents (e.g., N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine), UV radiation, and ionizing radiation (for reviews, see [153, 154, 157, 158] ). The enzyme PARP-1 helps in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and the preservation of genomic integrity and stability under homeostatic conditions. Corresponding to its function in maintaining nuclear homeostasis, PARP-1 constitutes a DNA base-excision repair system by sensing injury-induced DNA strand nicks and breaks and facilitating their repair through the synthesis of PAR polymer. When there is mild or moderate DNA damage, the activity of PARP-1 increases up to 500-fold, and the enzyme makes use of oxidized NAD (NAD + ), produced through the expenditure of ATP, to synthesize PAR polymer [158] .",

At first, PAR polymer translocates into the cytosol, where it constitutes a death signal to the mitochondria via dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, associated with direct binding to the PAR polymer-binding site on apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). As a result, AIF is released from the mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, it causes large-scale DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation through as-of-yet unidentified parthanatos AIF-associated nuclease (PAAN). Parthanatic cell death is the eventual outcome.

On the other hand, parthanatos is also reportedly implicated in the pathogenesis of several human disorders, in particular, stroke and several neurodegenerative diseases, but also in those who do not directly affect the nervous system [160] . Plausibly, therapeutic opportunities and the design of pharmacological intervention have already been envisaged. Thus, for MPT-RN, pharmacological interventions targeting putative components and upstream regulators of the PTPC complex may be potential targets for drug design. For parthanatos, the event of AIF translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus may currently be considered an attractive therapeutic target for drug design.

            "text": "Characteristically, NETosis differs from apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. Formation of NETosis is initiated in response to either infectious (e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal) or sterile (e.g., chemical) stimuli which bind to diverse neutrophil receptors including TLRs, Fc receptors, complement receptors, and cytokine receptors. Regarding defense against infectious tissue injury, NETs have been observed to trap microorganisms and exhibit bactericidal activity through the action of NET-associated components (e.g., antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil elastase) [161, 162] (for antimicrobial peptides, see Part VI, Sect. 23.4). This early-observed phenomenon had led to the notion that NETosis is a defense response to infection only. However, increasing evidence now suggests that this process might also occur in non-infectious, sterile inflammation [163] . Since neutrophils via PRR signalling are activated by MAMPs and/or DAMPs, it can be assumed that they are involved in NET formation. In fact, studies in support of this assumption have already been published. For example, in a murine model of IRI, the DAMPs HMGB1 and histones were found to stimulate NET formation through TLR4-and TLR9-MyD88 signalling pathways [170] . In other lines of studies, the DAMP MSU crystals were found to be potent inducers of NETosis [171] . Again different sets of studies provided evidence suggesting that TLRs could be even key regulatory factors in S. aureus-stimulated NET formation [172] . Three models for NETosis are being discussed to date: besides conventional suicidal NETosis, which occurs after several hours of stimulation, two types of nonsuicidal vital NETosis have recently been reported. Conventional suicidal NETosis is the best-described model that refers to a form of RN associated with final rupture of the plasma membrane. In vital NETosis, neutrophils release NETs without showing disruption of the membrane. Vital NETosis is induced within minutes by S. aureus through both complement receptors (e.g., C3R) and TLR2 ligands or by E. coli directly via TLR4 or indirectly via TLR4-activated platelets. Unexpectedly, after the release of the nucleus, these neutrophils are still able to phagocytose pathogens, and their lifespan is not affected by DNA loss [173] . Finally, another type of ROS-dependent vital NETosis has been described in which mtDNA is released instead of nDNA [174] . In these studies, viable neutrophils, following priming with GM-CSF and subsequent short-term TLR4 or complement factor 5a (C5a) receptor stimulation, were shown to generate NETs which contained mtDNA but no nDNA (for C5a and its receptor, see Part VI, Sects. 23.2.5 and 23.2.6).",

Upon activation of these receptors, downstream generation of ROS by the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex at the cytoplasmic or phagosomal membrane is accepted as an early dominant step in NET formation. Under the influence of ROS, granules and the nuclear envelope rupture, followed by release of nuclear, granular, and cytoplasmic contents which finally mingle. Then, neutrophil elastase (NE) and MPO are released from a select group of neutrophil granules, called azurophilic granules, into the cytosol and migrate to the nucleus, where they promote histone degradation and chromatin decondensation, respectively. Also, ROS leads to the activation of protein-arginine deiminase 4, an enzyme that converts arginine to citrulline on histones (e.g., histone H3), thereby fostering further chromatin decondensation in the neutrophil nucleus. In fact, citrullination also termed deimination of histones is regarded as another critical step in NET formation that occurs downstream of ROS (for histone modifications, see Part VI, Sect. 24.2.2). As a consequence of these events, the nuclear membrane ruptures, and damaged chromatin is released into the cytosol where it is further decorated with granular and cytosolic proteins to form the NETs, a process that leads to final cell death. Notably, it is not completely understood how these traps are ultimately expelled into the extracellular space; disruption of the plasma membrane, however, is the prevailing view [163, 175] .",

The induction of vital NETosis subsequently triggers a typical non-lytic pathway that is characterized by the release of nDNA through three morphological changes: (1) nuclear envelope growth and vesicle release, (2) nuclear decondensation, and (3) nuclear envelope disruption. In fact, electron microscopy revealed that NET release induced by S. aureus occurs via blebbing of the nuclear envelope and vesicular exportation in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in [12, 173, 176] ). As a result, this pathway preserved the integrity of the neutrophils' plasma membranes. Hence, NETting neutrophils become \"anuclear cytoplasts\" capable of detecting, capturing, and trapping pathogens [177] .",

Per definition, this RCD is associated with the emission of DAMPs, in particular, nuclear DAMPs, which, when emitted in large amounts in the course of excessive NET formation, aggravates an inflammatory response and, hence, may contribute to diseases characterized by acute hyperinflammation or chronic inflammation. Thus, NETosis has been identified to be implicated in septic infections, ARDS following severe trauma, autoinflammatory, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases. Furthermore, NETs have been observed to act as a scaffold for thrombus formation [179] which is increasingly being recognized as a critical phenomenon linking inflammation with venous thrombosis. Interestingly, recent studies in a mouse model of venous thrombosis provided evidence that platelet-derived disulfide HMGB1 act as a central mediator of the sterile inflammatory process in venous thrombosis [180] .",

This window is just as narrow as it has to be to prevent viral or bacterial expansion. However, upon massive necrosis, as it happens during severe infection, trauma, and postischemic reperfusion of organs, active secretion of cytokines and chemokines, compared to passive release of constitutive DAMPs in large amounts, can only be of comparably minor importance.

When such cells, often macrophages, finally \"pyroptise,\" the immunogenicity is not limited to the standard cytosolic arsenal of constitutive DAMPs which are passively released but contains some \"extra flavor\" in terms of emission of inducible DAMPs to be \"extra immunogenic.\" In contrast, active transcription of IL-33 during necroptosis may exert an additional anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive effect; IL-33 has been shown to activate M2 \u2192 M2-like macrophages and stabilize Treg cells in the surrounding microenvironment, thereby keeping immunogenicity in check.",

Necroptosis can be triggered by engagement of TNF to TNF receptor superfamily (e.g., TNFR1), Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR3 and TLR4), or the DNA receptor DAI. In TNF-induced necroptosis, TNF binds to the TNF receptors and engages a complex formation, which includes TRAF2, cIAP, and RIPK1. RIPK1 recruits and activates RIPK3 that oligomerizes resulting in the formation of the necrosome. RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL which functions as a necroptosis inducer by causing plasma membrane rupture. The concise mechanisms of plasma membrane rupture have yet to be defined. In parallel, phosphorylated MLKL translocates to the nucleus and results in transcription of CXCL1, IL-33, and IL-1\u03b2 which are actively secreted.

Pyroptosis is induced by caspases which are activated within inflammasomes, here exemplified by the NLRP3 inflammasome as activated by DAMPs (HMGB1 and ATP) emitted in the course of oxidative tissue injury. In this example of canonical inflammasome activation, HMGB1 triggers TLR4-mediated transcription and translation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1\u03b2/pro-IL18 (priming step), whereas ATP leads indirectly via induction of ion perturbation (K + efflux) to final activation (activation step). Additionally, mitochondria-derived ROS serve as co-activating signal (for further details of activation, see Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2.2). Upon activation, the human inflammatory caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D, releasing the N-terminal domain from the autoinhibitory Gasdermin D-C domain. Activated Gasdermin D-N then binds to lipids in the plasma membrane and forms large pores, leading to release of cellular contents such as mature processed IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 as well as cell death.

DAMPs are passively released through Gasdermin D-N-induced pores and activate innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells to elicit a protective inflammatory response and antigen-specific adaptive antiviral immune response.
