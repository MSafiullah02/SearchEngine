            "text": "Degenerative and inflammatory diseases of the retina are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. In fact, approximately one million Americans suffer severe visual impairment from retinal and choroidal diseases. Retinal degenerative disorders consist of a diverse group of diseases frequently associated with a genetic predisposition; however, many cases are of unknown cause. Although considerable effort has been made to expand our understanding of these degenerative diseases, the exact mechanisms remain elusive. Over the years, animal models have provided us with unique opportunities to learn more about the pathogenesis and treatment of a variety of human diseases. One such example is coronavirus infections that serve as an excellent prototype for CNS and ocular diseases (Bergmann et al., 2006, Holmes, 2001, Hooks et al., 2001). Murine coronavirus infection of BALB/c mice results in a progressive retinal degeneration associated with autoimmune reactivity (Hooks et al., 1993, Robbins et al., 1990). This animal model, referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR), was established to investigate pathologic processes within the retina. Intravitreal injection of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), JHM strain, into BALB/c mice results in a biphasic disease. Acute virus induced retinitis develops in susceptible BALB/c mice from day 3 to 7 post-inoculation (PI) and progresses to chronic retinal degeneration from day 20 to 100. Injection of MHV into resistant CD-1 mice also results in acute infection without the late retinal degenerative phase of the disease (Wang et al., 1996).",

Nevertheless, viral RNA persists within the retina throughout the life of the animal (Komurasaki et al., 1996). Beginning at day 7, anti-viral neutralizing antibody is detectable in the sera and continues to rise during the course of the disease. On day 3, immune cells infiltrate the retina and this infiltration peaks at day 6. The most prominent infiltrating cell is the macrophage. In addition, CD4 T cells are seen at day 3 and 6, whereas, CD8 T cells are not detected until days 6 and 8 PI (Hooks et al., 2003, Vinores et al., 2001).",

In the degeneration resistant CD-1 mice, only the early inflammatory phase is observed without retinal degeneration. Since viral replication and clearance of infectious virus are nearly identical in the two mouse strains, it is plausible that the development of the degenerative phase is associated with host responses to the infection. We have previously identified an autoimmune component in BALB/c mice that is absent in CD-1 mice (Hooks et al., 1993). Autoantibodies from BALB/c sera were shown to react with retinal tissue and the RPE cell. Furthermore, BALB/c mouse CD4 T cells proliferate in response to retinal antigens. What factors contribute to these distinct host responses are unknown. However, it is well established that the innate immune system is essential for the development of protective adaptive immune responses. We therefore hypothesize that the intensity of the cytokine and chemokine responses very early in the course of the infection may contribute to these diverse host responses. In order to test this hypothesis, we focused on the interferons (IFN) and the IFN inducible chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10.",

The type 1 IFNs include IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03c9, that share a cellular receptor. The type II IFN is IFN-\u03b3, which is encoded by a single gene, has a separate cellular receptor and is produced by T cells and NK cells. All the IFNs have overlapping pleiotrophic effects on a variety of cellular functions. Studies using IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 receptor knockout mice have demonstrated that both IFN systems are essential for antiviral defense and are functionally non-redundant (Muller et al., 1994). Numerous studies have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 is important in controlling virus infections in the central nervous system (CNS) and this is a critical component in ocular inflammation (Hooks et al., 1988, Parra et al., 1999). Using our ECOR model system, we have demonstrated that the generation of IFN-\u03b3 by cells infiltrating the retina is an essential immune component responsible for non-cytolytic clearance of infectious virus from the retina (Hooks et al., 2003).",

CXCL9 (MIG) and CXCL10 (IP-10) are IFN inducible chemokines that attract T cells and NK cells to the site of inflammation. These cells contain the receptor CXCR3 on their surface. Several studies have identified these molecules as key components of host responses in virus infections and in autoimmune diseases (Christen et al., 2003, Khan et al., 2000, Salomon et al., 2002, Wallace et al., 2004). For example, MHV infections of the CNS have identified a critical role for CXCL10 and CXCR3 in attracting T cells into the CNS and thus provide protection to the host (Trifilo et al., 2004). An example of CXCL9 involvement in autoimmunity was clearly demonstrated by Lang et al. (2006). In a murine model system they showed that the localized expression of CXCL9, incited an enhanced infiltration of liver specific CD8 T cells and subsequent autoimmune liver damage. These studies clearly showed that autoimmune liver disease could be induced only after CXCL9 was expressed within the liver.",

Our initial studies did not evaluate the day 1 and day 2 time points in which the innate immune responses to the retinal virus infection could be measured. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate very early cytokine and chemokine profiles and compare the intensity of immune reactivity in coronavirus infected mice with a retinal degeneration susceptible and a retinal degeneration resistant background. We noted that immune reactivity is more robust at early time points in the retinal degeneration susceptible BALB/c mice compared to the degeneration resistant CD-1 mice. The key cytokines and chemokines identified are IFNs, CXCL9 and CXCL10.

BALB/c and CD-1 mice were inoculated with JHM virus, media (mock) or they remained untreated. At day 2, 4, 8 and 10 sera were collected and analyzed for IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-10 and IL-12.

As is seen in Fig. 2\n, IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were detected in the sera from both infected mouse strains. However, significantly different levels were observed in the BALB/c and CD-1 mice. Overall, the levels of IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were present earlier and at higher levels in BALB/c mice compared to CD-1 mice. As is noted in Fig. 2, at day 2, IFN-\u03b3 (233 pg/ml) was detected in sera from BALB/c mice, whereas, at this time point, IFN-\u03b3 was not detected in sera from CD-1 mice. As we have published previously, similar low levels of IFN-\u03b3 were detected in both mouse strains on day 4 and this cytokine was not detected at days 8 and 10. Fig. 2 illustrates that sera levels of CXCL10 were higher on day 2 (1021 pg/ml) and day 4 (547 pg/ml) in BALB/c mice in comparison to CD-1 mice at day 2 (120 pg/ml) at day 4 (289 pg/ml). Likewise, sera levels of CXCL9 were higher at day 2 (547 pg/ml) and at day 4 (789 pg/ml) in BALB/c mice in comparison to CD-1 mice at day 2 (135 pg/ml) and at day 4 (281 pg/ml).

This outcome was not expected and is strikingly different than what is reported in many other virus systems, including other MHV infection. In the MHV CNS model systems, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 gene expression were detected on day 3 and IFN-\u03b3 gene expression was observed later, on day 7 (Bergmann et al., 2006). Based on the literature, we would speculate that in ECOR leukocytes and dendritic cells serve as the source of IFN-\u03b1 while fibroblasts and epithelial cells may produce IFN-\u03b2. Recently, we have shown that the human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contain high levels of TLR3 and are a potent source of IFN-\u03b2 within the retina (Kumar et al., 2004). It is of interest to note that the RPE cell is the first cell in which the virus replicates within the retina and hence these RPE cells may represent an important source of IFN-\u03b2. To date, the major cell types responsible for IFN-\u03b3 production are specifically sensitized T cells and NK cells (Pestka et al., 2004). Since we are detecting IFN-\u03b3 at day 2 PI, it is highly likely that the NK cell is the source of IFN-\u03b3. In fact, in MHV infection of the CNS, NK cell recruitment occurs at day 2 in response to CXCL10 (Trifilo et al., 2004). In ECOR the type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are produced at similar levels in both BALB/c and CD-1 mice. In contrast, significantly more IFN-\u03b3 is produced early in BALB/c mice that are infected with MHV.",

Moreover, we do not see inflammatory cells within the retina until day 3. Macrophages are the predominant infiltrating cells. CD4 T cells are first seen at day 4 and CD8 T cells are first seen at day 6. Anti-viral neutralizing antibodies are first detected in the sera at day 6. In this report, we show that IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are all detected within the sera at day 2 PI. We detect high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and lower levels of IFN \u03b1, \u03b2. Therefore, the IFNs are detected at a time point prior to the time that we detect either new virus production or the components of the adaptive immune response (anti-neutralizing antibody, infiltrating cells). Therefore, based on these observations, we suggest that the IFNs act in concert as part of the innate immune response. Our findings are consistent with those of other investigators in which the IFNs have been reported to participate in the innate immune response (Hiscott, 2007, Wang et al., 2007).",

In fact, several studies identified these molecules as key components of host responses in virus infections and in autoimmune diseases. CXCL9 production was also shown to be important in Theiler's virus infection (Ure et al., 2005). Neutralization of CXCL9 in a mouse CNS model system resulted in enhanced virus expression and pathology. Recent studies from Zingernagle's laboratory demonstrated that CXCL9 generation in the liver is required for autoimmune liver damage (Lang et al., 2006). In this animal model system the presence of highly activated liver-specific effector CD8 T cells alone were not sufficient to induce immune destruction. However, TLR-3 activation induced IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 and these molecules up-regulated expression of CXCL9 within the liver. This sequence of events resulted in enhanced CD8 T cell infiltration and subsequent immune destruction in the liver. These studies clearly demonstrated that if CXCL9 was not expressed within the liver, these mice did not develop autoimmune liver damage. Thus, CXCL9 was the key factor that contributed to tissue destruction. In this study we demonstrated that dramatically higher levels of CXCL9 are expressed within retinal tissue in retinal degeneration susceptible mice. It is possible that localized CXCL9 expression within the retina may be a key factor in the retinal degenerative process.",

Despite the fact that there is evidence for multiple organ involvement, the pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Virus triggered cytopathic damage alone cannot explain the pathogenesis of SARS. A number of studies indicate that patients with a more vigorous immune response are at risk for poor outcome (Lo et al., 2006). One of the major contributors to this response may be chemokines. Serum levels of several chemokines, including CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL2 are increased in SARS patients (Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). In fact, serum concentrations of CXCL10 detected early after infection have been identified as an independent prognostic indicator of disease outcome (Tang et al., 2005). A second factor that may contribute to poor outcome in patients with a more robust immune response is autoimmune reactivity (Lo et al., 2006). In the early phase of the disease, autoantibodies directed against lung epithelial cells have been observed (Yang et al., 2005). These studies suggest that immune-mediated damage triggered by coronavirus is due in part to the intensity of immune reactivity, the activation of cytokines and chemokines and the possible participation of autoimmune reactivity.",

The studies presented here identify that one of the elements that IFNs contribute to host defense is the retinal production of CXCL9 and CXCL10. CXCL9 expression is a key factor in the development of autoimmune liver damage and may be one of the key factors in retinal tissue damage in retinal degeneration susceptible mice. We have recently demonstrated specific T cell reactivity to MHV in ECOR (unpublished data) and the presence of these chemokines may be important in that they may provide help in the migration of these cells to the retina for viral clearance. Additional studies are in progress to evaluate a direct role for chemokines in the degenerative process. One approach may be to delete chemokine production but this may be challenging due to the nature of the virus replication and spread. We know that eliminating the IFN-\u03b3 response results in increased virus titers and increased mortality in ECOR. The mice do not survive the acute phase (Hooks, 2003). Moreover, studies with MHV in the CNS also have demonstrated that loss of IFN-\u03b3 or CXCL10 results in increased virus replication and mortality (Dufour et al., 2002; Liu and Lane, 2001; Parra et al., 1999). Clearly, IFN-\u03b3 and the IFN-inducible chemokines are critical factors in infectious virus clearance. Therefore, strategies to down-regulate these molecules without eliminating IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL9 and CXCL10 will be necessary to evaluate pathogenic mechanisms of retinal degeneration in ECOR.",
