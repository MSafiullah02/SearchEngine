However, no studies have attempted to investigate the provision of pre-travel health advice from the travel agents\u2019 perspective. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at addressing this knowledge gap through better understanding travel agents\u2019 knowledge about the health risks at Hajj, what health advice they provide to the pilgrims, and their sources of health knowledge.",

A grounded theory approach was used [22], as it provided the ideal methodological framework in which to explore the pre-travel health advice Hajj travel agents provide to pilgrims in a way that allows for unexpected findings to be further explored. Grounded theory uses an inductive approach, whereby a cycle of data collection (interviews) and analysis is followed by subsequent interview and analysis cycles. Themes emerge from earlier interviews that inform subsequent interview questions to allow further exploration of emergent themes. This cycle continues until no new themes emerge and theoretical saturation is reached.",

Interestingly, in this study, while few tour operators were aware of the ongoing MERS-CoV risks in Saudi Arabia and had limited knowledge about its transmission mode and preventive measures, some participants mentioned that the advice about MERS-CoV was distributed only in 2014, but not in 2015 and 2016.

These results align with the pilgrim knowledge base examined in our quantitative surveys, which found a decline in pilgrims\u2019 awareness about MERS-CoV in 2015 (117/421, 27.8%) compared with the previous survey in 2014 (179/350, 51.1%) [16,17].

Remarkably, all participating travel agents also reported seasonal influenza vaccine as a second compulsory vaccine for obtaining the Hajj visa. This helps explain the finding from the quantitative surveys of pilgrims, which reported a comparatively high rate of influenza vaccine coverage among Australian Hajj pilgrims in several years (80% in 2014 [14] and 76% in 2015), which is much higher than for other countries (eg, 7.1% among Turkish pilgrims in 2015 [24] and 20% among Egyptian pilgrims between 2012 and 2015 [25]). In addition, our qualitative data revealed no knowledge or advice about the other recommended vaccines from the sampled Hajj travel agents. This result aligns with the quantitative findings relating to the low uptake of other recommended vaccines such as pneumococcal and pertussis vaccines among Australian Hajj pilgrims [14]. Similarly, low uptake has also been reported among international Hajj pilgrims [26].",

This is an important finding given the fact that the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah is mostly responsible for the management of administrative procedures of Hajj and Umrah, not for ensuring the health of Hajj pilgrims. The website provides information for authorized Hajj coordinators about related services such as issuing visas and organizing accommodation. Although the Saudi Arabian MoH is the official source of information about the health conditions for Hajj travellers, none of the sampled travel agents reported it as a source of their health knowledge. This also aligns with findings from the quantitative survey, which found more than half of Australian pilgrims were not aware of the official health recommendations issued by the Saudi Arabian MoH [14].

This unique finding identifies a potential path for a new health promotion strategy to help improve the health knowledge among Hajj travel agents and, as a result, among Hajj pilgrims. This can be achieved by encouraging the Saudi embassies around the world to disseminate accurate and adequate health information from the MoH to all authorised Hajj travel operators, and provide annual pre-Hajj training and educational programs to the tour operators, encouraging them to distribute the information to their pilgrims. It is noteworthy to highlight that the current health guidelines for Hajj travellers are published in medical journals or other platforms primarily targeted for health care providers, using technical/medical language that would be difficult for lay tour operator or pilgrims to comprehend. There is a need for a guideline published in simple and understandable language for lay pilgrims and tour operators [27].",
