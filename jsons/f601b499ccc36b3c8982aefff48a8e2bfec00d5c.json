We conducted a large-scale virtual screening for small molecules that are potential CoV-2 inhibitors. To this end, we utilized \"ChemAI,\" a deep neural network trained on more than 220M data points across 3.6M molecules from three public drug-discovery databases. With ChemAI, we screened and ranked one billion molecules from the ZINC database for favourable effects against CoV-2. We then reduced the result to the 30,000 top-ranked compounds, which are readily accessible and purchasable via the ZINC database. Additionally, we screened the DrugBank using ChemAI to allow for drug repurposing, which would be a fast way towards a therapy. We provide these top-ranked compounds of ZINC and Drug-Bank as a library for further screening with bioassays at https://github.com/ml-jku/ sars-cov-inhibitors-chemai.",

The network was trained in a multi-task setting, in which data from other bioassays was used to enhance the predictive power for SARS-CoV inhibitory effects. Each modelled biological effect is represented by an output neuron of the neural network. We utilized a small set of output neurons associated with SARS-CoV inhibition and a set of output neurons associated with toxic effects to rank compounds.",

A compound that inhibits both proteases could be promising drug candidates (Ledford, 2009; Collison, 2019) . The virus proteases are also strikingly similar to those in SARS-CoV-1 (Macchiagodena et al., 2020) , which is also an implicit assumption by docking-based approaches. We therefore select two groups of assays, one of which measures the inhibition of 3CLpro and the other the inhibition of PLpro (see Table 1 ). For each of those four assays, ChemAI possesses an output unit, which models the ability of small molecules to exhibit the effect measured by the assay. Thus, using the predictions yielded by ChemAI, it is possible to rank compounds by their predicted ability to inhibit the two main proteases of SARS-CoV-1, which can be a proxy for the inhibitory potential for SARS-CoV-2.",
