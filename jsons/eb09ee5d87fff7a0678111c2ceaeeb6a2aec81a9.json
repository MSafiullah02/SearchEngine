Regional epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases, primarily influenza A, continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality while remaining unpredictable in nature. Sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes and floods occur with little warning. The consequences of climate change and environmental degradation can only be expected to increase the incidence of some infectious diseases and weather-related crises, adding to the unpredictability of such events. Health system leaders, both in public health and healthcare, need to understand the international context and how coordination and response across or within jurisdictions will improve the likelihood of successful management of challenges. Public health emergencies respect no borders or political structures. The ability of institutions to adapt quickly can make a difference in health outcomes and a community's trust in those institutions.",

The development of country preparedness had been stimulated by the outbreak of H5N1 in chickens and subsequent deaths in humans in Hong Kong in 1996. With its resurgence in late 2003, not long after the end of the SARS outbreak, there were predictions that H5N1 might give rise to a pandemic, but it was not until the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 pandemic, in 2009, that there was the opportunity for a coordinated international response but plans were based on the assumption that an influenza pandemic would start in Asia. It was unexpected that a pandemic of human influenza would arise in a developed nation. Genetic analysis points to the origin being swine in Mexico. 7 An increase in influenza-like illness was seen in that country in mid-March 2009, and swine influenza A/ H1N1, similar to recent cases in California, was confirmed in Mexico by Canada, and by April, 28 cases were reported by WHO in Mexico, the United States, and Canada. 8 The H1N1 pandemic was the first Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared under IHR (2005). Canada was able to respond with well-prepared plans, but there were still challenges in vaccine supply and delivery. An external review of the functioning of the IHR (2005) during the H1N1 pandemic concluded, \"the world is (still) ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public-health emergency.\" 9",

Zika transmission has been found in all countries in the Americas except mainland Chile, Uruguay, and Canada. 16 The data suggest that silent transmission among humans, animals, and mosquitoes has occurred throughout tropical Africa and Asia for more than 70 years, but that genetic changes in the virus resulted in emergence of a strain with increased transmissibility leading to greater epidemic potential and perhaps virulence. 17 Brazil was the country initially affected and its response has been criticized, with suggestions that a previous lack of funding the public health system and healthcare facilities hampered the government's response. 18 Ebola Outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have been reported from Africa since 1972 when the disease was first recognized. It is therefore not new, but the magnitude and characteristics of recent outbreaks have severely pressured underfunded health systems.

Of the $66.6 million required for these nine countries, only $4.5 million has been pledged. The World Bank has concluded \"most countries would need to spend just $1-2 per person per year to reach an acceptable level of health emergency preparedness. That amounts to a return on investment of ten to one, or even higher. And the return on investment does not consider the benefits beyond health for the economy or social stability.

Foreign policy will influence decisions to act to promote health security in an outbreak which can aid control of the disease for the good of the people of the affected country and/or can have the objective of reducing the risk of spread to the provider country. Foreign states may decide to intervene to prevent disease and disasterassociated conflicts from enabling insurgents, regional spread and to reduce peace-keeping costs. 35 The involvement of donor countries may reflect past colonial interest and maintenance of sphere of influence. This was clear, for example, in the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa where the UK's efforts were directed to Sierra Leone and those of the United States of America to Liberia. Canada supported all three countries involved including Guinea, another member of Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. David Fidler, a legal scholar who has been directly involved in WHO's efforts on the IHR (2005) stated that \"When diseases threaten, or show the potential to threaten, national security, military capabilities, geopolitical or regional stability, national populations, economic power, and trade interests, foreign policy-makers take notice.\" 36 Foreign policy or a country's investments could have a negative influence on an outbreak. The present outbreak of Ebola in DRC is in areas where the extraction of the socalled conflict minerals and metallic ores including gold and coltan is an important source of revenue for government and militias. Insurgents have been implicated in direct attacks on healthcare workers and resistance to control measures including immunization is related to anti-government movements and antagonism to foreign workers suspected of spreading the disease intentionally. Canadians and the Government of Canada should be aware of, and examine, the business interests of Canadian-owned companies to see if they are negatively influencing the political and consequently the health situation. This could be a role for the newly appointed Ombudsperson for responsible Enterprise. 37 Coltan, gold, diamonds, and other minerals may not be the only sources of funding for the rival militias and armies, but they are significant components of financing. According to one commentator, the G-20, and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), countries should immediately scrutinize the conflict minerals trade and attempts to limit their use in cell phones and other electronics. 38 The national and local context",
