Both BSG and ECCO advise caution with initiating combination therapy, the former also suggests considering stopping thiopurine treatment in patients \u2265 65 years and those with significant comorbidities in stable remission. For patients commencing biological therapy, subcutaneously administered drug may be preferred based on local circumstances to maximize social distancing efforts. Forced switching to subcutaneous biologics should only be used in centers unable to provide infusions. There are no data to favor one class of biologics over another in the context of COVID-19. There is some indication that lower Thelper lymphocyte counts are associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA, which led ECCO to recommend against initiation of tofacitinib if therapeutic alternatives are available, in contrast to BSG and IOIBD. In case an infection develops, ECCO suggests postponing biologic treatment until resolution and considering stopping thiopurines and tofacitinib for the duration of the infection. Based upon experience with other coronaviruses and early experience with SARS-CoV-2, the benefits and harms of continuing corticosteroid treatment during infection should be weighed carefully. IOIBD suggests withholding all IBD-related medication, except for 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), topical steroids, and possibly vedolizumab until resolution of symptoms in case COVID-19 develops. Alternatively, medication can be restarted after two negative nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction tests. For general measures to prevent viral transmission, ECCO and IOIBD emphasize hand hygiene and avoiding contact with infected people, CCC also advocates workplace modifications to enable physical distancing for patients using immunosuppressants. Guidance from the BSG is more stringent in suggesting that patients with a comorbidity or > 70 years being treated with drugs other than 5-ASA/topical corticosteroids should undergo \"shielding\", a strict form of social distancing mandating the avoidance of face-to-face contact for at least 12 weeks. This recommendation extends to patients taking daily prednisolone equivalent of \u2265 20 mg, those during combination therapy induction, those with moderately-to-severely active disease despite treatment and those with short bowel syndrome or requiring parenteral nutrition. This stricter guidance from the BSG is an outlier with major implications for individual patients and should be taken in the context of the individual case. Patients treated with biologics or immunomodulators, including stable patients on combination therapy, should practice stringent social distancing, while patients treated with 5-ASA or topical corticosteroids should adhere to standard social distancing. Surveillance endoscopies should be deferred, and disease assessment endoscopies should be carefully assessed for priority, considering the possibility of alternative methods (biomarkers, radiology and capsule endoscopy).",
