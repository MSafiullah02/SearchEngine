Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and FASTA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33) with default values were used to find homologous hits. The sequence of ~ 3.4-kb fragment at the 3\u2032 end of the genome of one such strain, TE/77-13/ITA, including the partial RdRp gene and the complete ORF2 and ORF3 genes, was determined by 3\u2032 RACE protocol, as previously described (Scotto-Lavino et al., 2006). cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript III First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen Ltd., Milan, Italy) with primer QT. PCR was then performed with TaKaRa La Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Europe S.A.S. Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) with forward primer p290 and reverse primers QO and QI. Finally, the amplicons were purified and cloned by using TOPO\u00ae XL Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Ltd., Milan, Italy). Additional primers were designed to determine the complete 3.4 kb sequences by an overlapping strategy (Table 1\n). Sequence editing and multiple alignments were performed with the BioEdit software package, version 2.1 (Hall, 1999). Phylogenetic trees were generated using Bayesian analysis with MrBayes (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001, Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003). The appropriate substitution model settings were derived using jModelTest (Posada, 2009). The sequence obtained was analyzed with Simplot (Lole et al., 1999) using a window size of 200 and step size of 20, with gap strip off and Hamming correction on. Additionally, recombination analysis was carried out with different algorithms implemented in the Recombination Detection Program v.4.43 (RDP4) (Martin et al., 2010), with default settings.",

Phylogenetic analysis was based on the 750-nt sequence of the COOH terminus of the polymerase complex of the carnivore NoV strains available in the databases. Also, RdRp sequences of human GIV.1 NoVs were included in the analysis and used to calculate a nt identity matrix. By visual inspection of the tree, the carnivore NoVs segregated in at least three different genetic clusters (Fig. 1\n).

Two additional clusters were resolved in the tree that included, respectively, the human GIV.1 strains detected from stool and sewage samples in different geographic settings (Fankhauser et al., 2002, La Rosa et al., 2008, Eden et al., 2012, Ao et al., 2014, Han et al., 2014) and GIV.1 NoVs found in sewage samples in Italy in 2008\u20132009 (La Rosa et al., 2010).

Following strictly the outlines of Zheng's classification (Zheng et al., 2006), we classified the novel feline NoV, together with the canine strains Viseu and FD53, as a genotype 2 (> 85% pairwise aa identity intergenotypes), within the genogroup GVI (> 55% pairwise aa identity intergenogroups). Accordingly, cats and dogs may harbor NoVs of the same genotypes, GIV.2, GVI.1 and GVI.2. Circulation of NoVs genetically related in different host species has been already demonstrated. Porcine NoVs cluster in GII (Wang et al., 2005), but within different genotypes (GII.11, GII.18, and GII.19) from those infecting humans. GIII NoVs have been detected in large and small ruminants, with GIII.1 and GIII.2 (Liu et al., 1999, Oliver et al., 2007) found in cattle and GIII.3 in sheep (Wolf et al., 2009).

Binding of GVI.2 and GVI NoVs in dog tissues seems to be mediated by the presence of the H and A antigens of the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) family (Caddy et al., 2014) and therefore to be genetically determined, as observed in humans (Marionneau et al., 2002). This may suggests that dogs and cats share a similar pattern of HBGAs as attachment factor for NoV infections. Also, virus-like particles of seven different human NoV genotypes (GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, and GII.12) have been shown to be able to bind to canine gastrointestinal tissues (Caddy et al., 2015). It will be interesting to assess whether cats may also be infected by human NoVs, as observed in dogs (Summa et al., 2012, Caddy et al., 2015), as this may have implications for the transmission of human NoVs.",

The canine NoV strain Bari/91/07/ITA, resembles GIV.2 NoVs in its polymerase gene while it is genetically unrelated in the VP1 gene to GIV NoV (Martella et al., 2009). The feline NoV strain, JPN/2012/M49 (Takano et al., 2015), possesses a GIV.2 RdRp region, and a GVI.1 ORF2 related to the canine virus Bari/91/07/ITA (87.0% aa identity). In all the cases, the site of recombination was mapped to the ORF1/ORF2 junction region. This part of NoV genome is highly conserved and has been individuated as a preferential recombination site (Bull et al., 2005). Recombination has been shown to strongly influence the evolution and epidemiology of human NoVs (Ambert-Balay et al., 2005, Reuter et al., 2006) and surely poses a challenge for the development of specific diagnostic tools for NoV of carnivores. Analysis of the RdRp fragment cannot be used to characterize unequivocally these animal NoVs and a definitive characterization should rely on the ORF2.",
