            "text": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It remains a major public health problem often associated with poor outcomes after standard medical therapy and endoscopic sinus surgery.1, 2 Primarily based on the absence or presence of nasal polyps, CRS is currently divided into two types, CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).1, 2 CRSsNP and CRSwNP are characterized by distinctive expression patterns of inflammatory and remodeling mediators, suggesting that they may have different etiologies.1, 2 During the last decade, although significant progress has been made regarding the immunopathologic characteristics of CRS, the initial triggers of the persistent inflammation in CRS remain unknown. In some specific subgroups of CRS patients, bacterial or fungal infection has been suggested to be a trigger and/or modifier of the inflammation process in CRS.1, 2 Respiratory virus planting is a common condition in the upper respiratory tract, and acute rhinosinusitis is thought to be initiated by a respiratory virus infection.3, 4 In vitro studies have demonstrated that respiratory viral infection can cause damage to nasal epithelial cells, impair tight junctions in nasal epithelial cells, and facilitate invasion of bacteria into nasal mucosa.5, 6 Nevertheless, few studies have explored the association between viral infection and CRS, and the prevalence of a viral pathogen in CRS patients remain uncertain.7, 8, 9 Recently, Cho et al. detected a higher prevalence of respiratory viruses, particularly rhinovirus, in nasal lavage fluid and inferior turbinate epithelial cell samples from CRS patients than that seen in controls, suggesting an association between respiratory viral infection and CRS. However, a significant limitation of Cho et al.'s study is that nasal lavage fluid samples and epithelial cell samples scraped from inferior turbinate may be unable to reflect the condition in the sinuses and middle meatus, where the development of CRS takes place.7 In another study, Wood et al. investigated the presence of a respiratory virus in the sinus mucosa from CRS patients and controls and did not detect any respiratory virus in all the samples examined, disfavoring a role of viral infection in CRS. Unfortunately, the very limited sample size (five CRSwNP patients, eight CRSsNP patients, and two controls) in Wood et al.'s study might lead to a biased result.8 Our preliminary study on four common respiratory viruses failed to find any difference in respiratory virus detection rate in nasal epithelial cells scraped from the middle meatus between controls and CRS patients, although a high frequency of virus presence was demonstrated in samples from both groups.10 In this prospective study, we extended our previous preliminary study and tested the nucleic acid of nine common respiratory viruses in epithelial cells scraped from the middle meatus in a comparatively larger population. Moreover, the relationship between viral infection and clinical disease severity was evaluated. We found that there was no difference in virus detection rate among controls, CRSsNP patients, and CRSwNP patients, and there was no association between viral infection and clinical disease severity.",

A total of 67 CRSwNP and 61 CRSsNP patients were recruited. CRSwNP and CRSsNP were diagnosed according to the current US guidelines and the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps.1, 2 All recruited patients suffered from bilateral CRS with invasion of at least the maxillary and ethmoidal sinus. Fifty\u2010three patients undergoing septoplasty because of anatomic variations and not having sinus disease were enrolled as control subjects. All participants were enrolled from March 2010 to January 2013. The sample size was approximately equally distributed over the study period. None of the patients had an acute upper respiratory infection during the 4 weeks before the recruitment or a history of aspirin sensitivity. All patients stopped oral and topic application of corticosteroids at least 3 months and 1 month before the study, respectively. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, antrochoanal polyps, congenital mucociliary problems, fungal sinusitis, systemic vasculitis, or gastroesophageal reflux diseases. The diagnosis of asthma was based on history and physician's diagnosis according to the Global Initiative for Asthma 2006 guideline.11 Allergic rhinitis was diagnosed on the concordance between a typical history of allergic symptoms and the atopy test. The atopic status was evaluated by skin prick test to a standard panel of aeroallergens or by using the ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) for detecting immunoglobulin E antibodies against various common inhalant allergens. Subjective symptoms were scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) of zero to 10 as previously described.12 The focus was on five major symptoms: nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, loss of sense of smell, facial pain or pressure, and headache.12 A total VAS symptom score was calculated based on the sum of these five VAS symptom domains. Endoscopy physical findings were scored according to Lanza and Kennedy.13 Findings on sinus coronal computed tomography (CT) scans were graded using the Lund\u2010Mackay CT scoring system.14 Clinical data of patients are summarized in Table 1.",

The solution was then transferred to an RNase\u2010free filtration column CS in an RNase\u2010free collection tube, which was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes at 4\u00b0C to filter the RNA. The filtered liquid was mixed with 600 \u03bcL of 70% ethanol and transferred to an RNase\u2010free spin column CR3 in an RNase\u2010free collection tube. The collection tube was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4\u00b0C for adsorption of the RNA. After that, buffer RW1 and DNase I were used to remove protein and DNA, respectively. Buffer RW was used for washing the RNA, and the RNA was redissolved by RNase\u2010free ddH2O. Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Oligo\u2010dT with Quantscript RT kit (Tiangen Biotech) in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL including 1 \u00d7 RT mix (RNasin, DL\u2010dithiothreitol), 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 200 U quant reverse transcriptase, 1 \u03bcM Oligo\u2010dT, 1 \u03bcg RNA, and additional RNase\u2010free water.15 The reverse transcription was conducted at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. After reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted as reported.7 Briefly, the cDNA samples were amplified with the virus\u2010specific primer pairs (Table 2) using the 2 \u00d7 PCR reagent (Tiangen Biotech). The housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, served as an internal control for PCR. The 20 \u03bcL PCR reaction system containing 1 \u00d7 PCR reagent (1 U Taq Plus Polymerase, 250 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 10 mM Tris\u2010HCL, 50 mM KCL, 1.5 mM MgCl2), 0.2 \u03bcM forward primer, 0.2 \u03bcM reverse primer, 50 ng cDNA, and an additional 8.2 \u03bcL RNase\u2010free water. The PCR reaction was conducted in a thermal cycler S100 (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA) programmed for initial cDNA synthesis and predenaturation (94\u00b0C for 2 minutes), followed by 45 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 30 seconds at a specific temperature, and extension for 1 minute at 72\u00b0C. A final incubation was conducted for 4 minutes at 72\u00b0C. Specific virus cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Zhan\u2010Qiu Yang, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P. R. China) served as a positive control. Distilled water was used as a negative control. All PCR products were further assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ultraviolet transillumination. The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing.",

            "text": "Respiratory virus infection is considered to play an important role in the development of lower respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite the well\u2010established link between CRS and chronic inflammatory lower airway diseases, the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of CRS has received little attention. Concerning the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of CRS, three hypotheses have been proposed1, 8: 1) viruses are the trigger of CRS, 2) viruses are the ongoing stimulus of chronic inflammation, and 3) viruses are the causes of acute exacerbation of CRS. Similar to the two previously published studies,7, 8 in this study, we examined whether there is an association between respiratory virus persistence and the chronic status of CRS in subjects without signs of acute viral infection. Compared with previous studies,7, 8 the strengths of our current study are that a relatively larger sample size is more likely to lead to unbiased results, and epithelial cell samples from the middle meatus is more suitable to reflect the status of CRS. We found viruses present in the majority of subjects (approximately 70%) no matter whether in controls or in CRS subjects. On the contrary, Wood et al. did not detect any viruses in sinus mucosa from controls and CRS patients. This discrepancy may in part be due to the methodological difference. In Wood et al.'s study, samples were collected during the summer months when respiratory viruses are far less prevalent, and very limited subjects were examined.8 In our study, we could not find any difference in the overall positive rate of virus infection, the positive rate of any specific virus infection, or the positive rate of coinfection of multiple species among controls, CRSsNP patients, and CRSwNP patients, indicating that the frequency of respiratory viral infection is not increased in CRS patients. In contrast, Cho et al. found that the detection rate of respiratory viruses was significantly increased in CRS patients compared with that seen in controls (64% vs. 30%).7 The sample size in Cho et al.'s study is comparable to ours. However, in Cho et al.'s study, epithelial cells from the inferior turbinate instead of those from the middle meatus or sinus cavity were investigated for the presence of a respiratory virus. Sampling the inferior turbinate is not appropriate, because in CRS, inflammation development takes place in the middle meatus and sinus rather than in the inferior turbinate.",

Based on the similar positive rate of viral infection in CRS and controls, and the similar clinical disease severity between subjects with and without viral infection, one would think that viral infection may not be the ongoing stimulus of chronic inflammation in CRS. Nevertheless, the impact of viral infection on the disease initiation and development also depends on the host response. Our previously study indicated that the innate response to viral infection may be altered in CRS patients, which may lead to subsequent exaggerated and persistent inflammation in CRS.10 Therefore, to elucidate the role of viral infection in the pathogenesis of CRS, it is necessary to dissect the impact of viral infection under particular disease\u2010related host immune response. The lack of association between viral infection and clinical disease severity dose not absolutely preclude the role of viral infection in the inflammation process of CRS either, because it is possible that clinical instruments may not reflect the underlying inflammation precisely. It should also be noted that we and others did not quantify the copies of respiratory viruses. It is possible that although we did not find a difference in virus positive rate, there may be a difference in copy numbers of respiratory viruses between controls and CRS patients, which awaits further study. Another limitation of the current study is that only common respiratory viruses were studied. Further study using unbiased, highly sensitive genomic\u2010based discovery methods, such as a pan\u2010viral microarray platform and deep sequencing, may provide a comprehensive landscape of viral infection in CRS.16 In addition, whether viruses play a role in the initiation and exacerbation of CRS also requires further study.",
