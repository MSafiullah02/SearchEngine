Reoviruses, originally referred to as \u201crespiratory enteric orphans\u201d, were first isolated from humans in the United States and Mexico in the 1950s (1). MRVs are represented by four prototype strains: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), type 3 Dearing (T3D) and type 4 Ndelle (T4N), with the majority of strains assigned to serogroups T1L, T2J or T3D (2). Reoviruses have been isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of children with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms (1). However, limited studies have focused on human reovirus-associated neurological disease to date (3). Pneumonia and other respiratory diseases in both naturally and experimentally infected primates (4), and isolation of reoviruses from children with meningitis and encephalitis are widely documented 5, 6.",

Currently, more than 40 antiviral drugs are licensed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpesviruses. However, the number of licensed antiviral drugs for treatment of highly pathogenic RNA virus infections remains limited (10). These viral diseases are considered difficult to treat with selective antiviral chemotherapy, highlighting the need for further refinement of antiviral drug design and development. Medicinal plants have a variety of chemical constituents, including alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, lignans and coumarins, known to inhibit the replication cycles of various DNA and RNA virus types. Compounds derived from natural sources are therefore of significant interest as possible sources of viral infection control 7, 8, 9.",

(S. flavescens) have been historically used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine, owing their anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, antipyretic, antiasthmatic, and antiulcerative effects, and for the treatment of diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and eczema (11). Additionally, a formulation containing S. flavescens is reported to inhibit angiogenesis in a collagen-induced arthritis rat model (12). In previous studies, quinolizidine alkaloids, flavonoids, and triterpenoids were isolated from the roots of S. flavescens\n(13). Recently, quinolizidine alkaloids and flavonoids have been shown to exhibit a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antibacterial, and anti-influenza properties 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. However, the potential anti-reovirus activities of extracts and compounds isolated from S. flavescens have not been examined to date. In the current investigation, we evaluated the abilities of the MeOH extract, EtOAc fraction and kuraridin isolated from S. flavescens to inhibit human type 1\u20133 reoviruses (HRV1\u20133) and Korean porcine reovirus (PRV). Antiviral assays were employed to determine whether the S. flavescens compounds alter reovirus activity by inhibiting virus attachment and/or replication.",

The residue was suspended in distilled water (1 L) and extracted with n-hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and BuOH. In this process, n-hexane (3.9 g), CHCl3 (22 g), EtOAc (33.5 g) and BuOH (38.9 g) layers were obtained respectively. The EtOAc layer was submitted to open column chromatography on silica gel (230\u2013400 mesh, 300 g, Merck) using gradient solvent system CHCl3-EtOAc (100:1, 80:1, 50:1, 30:1, 10:1, 1:1, 1:10, 1:100; v/v, each 1L) as eluent to yield 21 fractions (F1\u2013F21) by TLC profile. F15 (2 g) was subjected to column chromatography on ODS (70 g, Cosmosil 140C18-PREP, 140 \u03bcm, Nacalai tesque, INC.) eluted with MeOH\u2013H2O (50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10, 100:0; v/v, each 200 mL) to yielded 12 fractions (F15\u20131\u223c12) based on the TLC profile. F15\u20139 (120 mg) was chromatographed on reverse-phase (10 g) column using a MeOH\u2013H2O solvent gradient (70:30, 80:20, 90:10, 100:0; v/v, each 50 mL) to yield compound 1 (53 mg). Compound 1 was obtained as orange oil, it exhibited a molecular ion peak at m/z 438 [M+H]+ in the ESI-MS and molecular formula was determined as C26H30O6. The presence of lavandulyl group was inferred from three methyl protons [\u03b4 1.55 (3H, s, H-6\u2033), 1.62 (3H, s, H-7\u2033), 1.70 (3H, s, H-10\u2033)], three olefinic protons [\u03b4 5.03 (1H, m, H-4\u2033), 4.58 (1H, br s, H-9\u2033a), 4.53 (1H, br s, H-9\u2033b)], two methylene protons [\u03b4 2.53 (1H, m, H-2\u2033), 2.06 (2H, m, H-3\u2033)] and a multiple at \u03b4 2.61 (2H, m, H-1\u2033). The 13C NMR spectrum revealed the presence of 26 carbons as one carbonyl group, three methylene carbons, four methyl carbons, eight methines and ten quaternary carbons. Thus, the structure of compound 1 was determined by spectroscopic analysis (MS and NMR) and compared with the data published in the literature (22). The compound identified was kuraridin (Fig. 1\n).",

The MeOH extract and EtOAc fraction inhibited viral replication in preliminary experiments (Fig. 4B), with a decreasing order of activity against HRV3, PRV, HRV2 and HRV1 (Table 1). Kuraridin exerted decreasing antiviral activity in the following order: PRV, HRV3, HRV2, and HRV1 (Table 1). Similar to the results of the simultaneous treatment assay, all three isolate fractions showed stronger inhibitory effects on HRV3 and PRV than HRV1 or HRV2. Viral RNA levels synthesized at the early and late stages of virus infection were compared between kuraridin-treated (30 \u03bcM) and untreated infected cells. RNA extraction was performed at 6 and 18 h post-infection with HRV1\u20133 and PRV, and the levels of intracellular viral RNA measured via real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR data disclosed reduced reovirus RNA levels in kuraridin-treated cells, compared with non-treated cells (0.5% DMSO) HRV1\u20133 and PRV (Fig. 6\nA). Viral RNA inhibition in kuraridin-treated cells was the greatest at late-stage (18 h) infection, indicating that kuraridin (30 \u03bcM) inhibits viral RNA synthesis most strongly at the late stage (18 h) than the early stage (6 h) of infection. Furthermore, we observed dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA in PRV-infected TF-104 cells treated with 5\u201350 \u03bcM kuraridin for 24 h post-infection (Fig. 6B). The immunofluorescence assay conducted to investigate viral protein (sigma 1) inhibition by kuraridin (30 \u03bcM) in PRV-infected TF-104 cells demonstrated green fluorescence for virus-infected (Fig. 7\nB) but not mock-infected cells (Fig. 7A). Treatment of cells with kuraridin led to a marked reduction in the number of fluorescent cells infected with PRV (Fig. 7C). To determine the effects of the two extracts and kuraridin on reovirus production, we performed the virus yield reduction assay. Viral yields were estimated using a plaque assay. Notably, the MeOH extract, EtOAc fraction, and kuraridin suppressed production of HRV1\u20133 and PRV in a dose-dependent manner indicating inhibition of reovirus shedding or release (Fig. 8\n).",

The sigma 1 protein specifies tissue tropism and is responsible for hemagglutination (HA) activity and binding of SA 29, 30. The HA activity of reoviruses strongly implies a role of SA in cell binding and infectivity of reoviruses, similar to influenza A virus, rotavirus, various coronaviruses and Sendai virus (31). In the current study, the HI assay was employed to assess the inhibitory effects of the extracts and kuraridin on viral adsorption to host cells. The MeOH extract and EtOAc fraction completely inhibited HRV1 adsorption to hRBCs as well as HRV2\u20133 and PRV adsorption to bRBCs at concentrations below 92.5 \u03bcg/mL. Kuraridin induced complete inhibition of hemagglutination activity of HRV1 with hRBCs and HRV2\u20133 and PRV with bRBCs at concentrations below 82.5 \u03bcM (Fig. 5). I21nterestingly, the HI activity of kuraridin was stronger for HRV3 and PRV than HRV1 and HRV2. These differences are linked to sigma 1 protein sequences and possibly attributable to serotype-specific interactions of viral proteins with different cell surface receptors. Five residues (Asn198, Arg202, Leu203, Pro204, and Gly205) in sigma 1 protein are reported to play a role in reovirus and SA interactions (32). Additionally, SA binding by sigma 1 protein of type 3 reovirus is mediated by an eight-stranded cross \u03b2-sheet of only the T(iii) domain (residues 175\u2013234) and hemagglutination by type 1 reovirus mediated by the T(iii) and T(iv) domains (residues 248\u2013314) (33). Thus, the diversity of sigma 1 protein according to type 1\u20133 serotypes may influence interactions of kuraridin with hemagglutinin on the protein. HI assay results were in agreement with those of the simultaneous treatment assay (Table 1), indicating that the extracts and kuraridin potentially exert anti-reoviral activity via blockage of viral attachment to SA at the host cell surface. Inhibition of virus attachment, in turn, prevents virus entry, replication and occurrence of infection.",

Although the mechanisms by which kuraridin inhibits reovirus replication are currently unclear, the compound is known to affect viral factors, such as RNA and protein. Our experiments showed that viral RNA levels are significantly lowered by kuraridin. Interestingly, reoviral RNA synthesis was significantly inhibited by kuraridin at the late stage (18 h) of the viral replication cycle for HRV3 and PRV (Fig. 6A). The reovirus replication cycle comprises two distinct transcription phases (primary and secondary), which occur at early and late stages, respectively. For primary transcription, viral RNA rapidly replicates at 6\u20138 h post-infection within progeny viral particles. Secondary transcription is mediated by particles assembled from the newly synthesized RNA and protein molecules, and mature virions are produced at >12 h post-infection (4). Our findings indicate that kuraridin inhibits viral protein synthesis (sigma 1) to produce the same changes in viral RNA levels and reduces virus shedding (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Based on these results, we suggest that the kuraridin suppresses reovirus replication via inhibition of viral RNA, protein synthesis and virus release.",

The dipeptide, benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-FA-FMK), is a novel potent inhibitor of reovirus pathogenesis and oncolysis in vivo\n(42). These drugs act by inhibiting reovirus replication and adsorption, but their potential side-effects are yet to be clinically evaluated. These natural products may be ideal candidates, since they are less toxic, more effective, have fewer side-effects, and are less expensive than commercially available anti-reovirus agents. The results from the current study collectively indicate that compounds isolated from S. flavescens may be superior to anti-reovirus agents, and further highlight the medical importance of identifying effective natural antiviral agents.",
