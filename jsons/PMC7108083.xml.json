Subjects were divided into 3 groups according to their proximity to the common source of SARS coronavirus present in the Amoy Gardens: (1) Amoy Gardens residents, (2) residents in the surrounding residential buildings (North: Lee Kee Building, Wang Kwong Building, Jade Field Gardens [Ka Lai Mansion, Ka Yin Mansion, Ka Yan Mansion], Tak Bo Gardens; East: Choi Ha Estate; South: Upper Ngau Tau Kok Estate, Lok Wah Estate; West: Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate, Telford Gardens), and (3) residents elsewhere in Kwun Tong (KT) District, 1 of 18 districts of Hong Kong, where the Amoy Gardens was located. Epidemic curves were produced for each group and compared. The spatial distribution of all cases in Amoy Gardens and surrounding residential buildings was located on a map, focusing on cases with symptom onset during the period 24\u201329 March 2003, that is, 5\u201310 days after the index patient visited a unit in Block E of Amoy Gardens on March 19 and used the toilet there [2]. The index patient was receiving renal dialysis in the Prince of Wales Hospital during the largest nosocomial outbreak [3], had diarrhea, and was subsequently found to have very high viral load.",

The numbers of cases in the surrounding buildings were much smaller, but a small peak could be seen on 25 March 2003. In contrast, no peaks of the epidemic curve among residents elsewhere in KT District were noted, and the number of cases was small. The proportion of cases with symptom onset during the period 24\u201329 March was 76.4% (253/331), 55.3% (57/103), and 16.2% (16/99), respectively, for Amoy Gardens residents, residents in the surrounding residential buildings, and residents elsewhere in KT District.\n",

A substantial number of cases also occurred in residential buildings near the Amoy Gardens (n = 103). In the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate (LNTKE), a public housing estate with 14 large apartment buildings, 48 cases were reported. All but 1 case concentrated in the 7 buildings (blocks 8\u201314) situated directly downwind (southwest) from blocks A\u2013G of Amoy Gardens. To the west of the LNTKE, across a major highway and railroad, is a huge residential complex (Telford Gardens) comprising 41 buildings where 6 cases were reported, 5 of which were from buildings directly facing LNTKE. Furthermore, 14 cases were reported in another private housing estate (Lee Kee Building) with 4 buildings about 30 m northwest of buildings C and D of Amoy Gardens. The next housing estate (Wang Kwong Building) in the northwest direction with 3 buildings reported 8 cases. Farther northwest, 3 cases were reported from the next housing estate of 3 buildings (Jade Field Gardens) and 5 cases from the last housing estate with 8 buildings (Tak Bo Gardens) in that direction (about 200 m from block E of Amoy Gardens). If only cases with symptom onset during 24\u201329 March were included, the directional localization of infected subjects became clearer, with an apparent gradient to the north/northwest (Figure 2). No cases occurred in Choi Ha Estate to the northeast of Amoy Gardens, and only 1 case occurred in Upper Ngau Tau Kok Estate and 2 cases in Lok Wah Estate to the south and southeast.",

Common sources of contaminated food or water were not reported, and the only mode of spread that could adequately explain this common-source outbreak was airborne transmission.",

The prevailing northeasterly wind at the time could explain the spread to LNTKE and then Telford Gardens on the west/southwest of blocks A\u2013G of Amoy Gardens. The spread to the residential buildings located to the north/northwest was in line with our earlier computational fluid dynamics modeling that showed a portion of the hypothetical virus-laden plume passing through the space between blocks C and D and spreading toward the northwest [2]. No cases occurred during the period 24\u201329 March in the 2 housing estates (Kai Tai Court and Kai Yip Estate) about 300 m northwest of Telford Gardens, which suggested that the spread through the wind did not extend that far, possibly due to too much dilution over the distance. Considering that cases in Telford Gardens and Tak Bo Garden with symptom onset during 24\u201329 March were most likely resulting from the common source originating in block E of Amoy Gardens, the distance of airborne transmission in that outbreak could be >200 m.",
