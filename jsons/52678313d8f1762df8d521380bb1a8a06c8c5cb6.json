            "text": "MDDs are needed for delivering true personalized medicine. Personalized medicine focuses on treating the patient, rather than the disease. It is genotypebased medicine, rather than phenotype-or symptom-based. An MDD test also makes it possible to practice theranosis (therapy guided by a diagnosis) by developing or reclassifying drugs that specifically target the molecular cause of the disease. If pharmacogenomics is the development of drugs based on individual genotypes, then theranosis is the administration of drugs based on individual (or infectious agent) genotypes. It is clear that MDDs are needed, but in order to make the assays practical, we want them to have the following advanced features: r Multiplex capabilities. The definition of multiplexing is \"receiving multiple signals from the same source.\" For MDDs, multiplexing refers to the ability to conduct multiple genotyping tests at the same time and within the same sample. We want multiplexing because it requires only small amounts of precious patient sample; it allows the clinician to run fewer tests while acquiring more relevant information; it reduces the amount of reagents, consumables, and time involved; and most importantly, it can save lives. For infectious diseases MDDs, we want a multiplex test that can identify all pathogens related to a clinical syndrome or that can detect all the genes and mutations responsible for the drug-resistance phenotype. r Specificity. Even though multiple microorganisms are studied simultaneously, we want only the pathogens associated with the infection be identified with a high level of confidence. r Sensitivity. We want a MDD to be able to identify a pathogen or drug resistance directly from a patient sample or enrichment culture. Using the patient sample directly reduces the time required for bacterial or viral culture preparation and enzymatic testing. Yet, bypassing this propagation step forces the assay to be sensitive enough to detect only a small amount of pathogen material present in the patient sample. r Reliability. For clinical application of MDDs, a consistent performance from assay to assay and from lot to lot is required. r Speed. For an MDD to be practical for infectious disease diagnosis and treatment, it must be locally available and produce results within a few hours. r Simplicity. An MDD should not require a Ph.D. laboratory scientist to conduct the assay. An MDD should be user-friendly and even automatable. No special training should be required to perform the assay. The MDD system should be easily integrated into standard molecular laboratory practice. r Affordability. MDDs should be efficient and cost-effective.",

In regular multiplex PCR reactions, for multiple targets that need to be coamplified, each may demand its unique annealing temperature or different buffer strength. primer sets to work under a single amplification profile, and multiplex PCR is nearly impossible under standard conditions. With Templex ( Fig. 27.4) , there are two sets of nested primers for each target in the enrichment stage. This design gives rise to four possible forward and reverse primer combinations for amplification. Each combination may have its own optimal amplification profile, but given four amplification opportunities, a common condition that satisfies all targets can be attained. For example, if multiplex PCR is a baseball game, traditional multiplex PCR is equivalent to the expectation that every player (or target to be co-amplified) on the team will hit a home run on the first and the only swing. Templex, on the other hand, provides each player with four chances to hit a home run.",

Second, standard multiplex PCR uses multiple sets of high-concentration, labeled primers. These primers can associate with one another to form dimers or create nonspecific, background amplification. Reduced amplification efficiency can also occur when primers occupy active sites on the polymerase. In addition, unused labeled primers produce background signal and use up reagents during the detection portion of the assay. Because of these issues, post-PCR clean-up (such as spin column purification) is often required to remove these labeled primers before they can be used as probes. Yet, high-concentration primers are only required in the last cycles of a PCR reaction. With Templex, the amount of gene-specific primers used is only enough to \"enrich\" the targets and incorporate the SuperPrimer tag into the PCR products. After enrichment and tag incorporation, amplification is carried out with only one pair of primers. Because only one pair of primers is labeled, the background is low; therefore, no post-PCR clean-up is required. The PCR reaction is also very specific and sensitive. No posthybridization washes are necessary. This feature makes it feasible to fully automate the laboratory procedures and perform high-throughput clinical studies.",

Each bead has as many as 10 8 COOH groups on its surface for linking capture oligos. The green laser can detect the signal for as few as eight fluorescently labeled probes that are captured by a bead. Another important feature of the xMAP platform is its repeatability. Because everything occurs in a homogeneous solution (from bead manufacture, color-code staining, and capture probe coupling to product hybridization and data collection), highly repeatable results are obtained with this platform. The xMAP method for collecting and reporting data also contributes to repeatability. Typically, there are 5000 beads added per reaction for each color-coded bead set. Each bead set is specific for a particular disease marker, such as a mutation or a pathogen. The laser counts 100 microspheres from each bead set and reports the median fluorescent intensity (MFI).

Real-time PCR is unique in that it integrates an amplification method (PCR) and a detection method (hybridization) with an all-in-one platform that combines a thermocycler with a detection instrument. The Roche real-time PCR method adds a probe directly into the PCR reaction to detect amplification products. This short probe is labeled with a fluorescent dye at one end and a quencher at the other. When in close proximity to the dye molecule, the quencher suppresses the fluorescent signal and inhibits its detection. When the probe binds to a PCR product, the fluorescent dye is removed by DNA polymerase, which is also the enzyme used for PCR amplification. By doing so, the fluorescent signal is released from its quencher and detected by the instrument. The advantage of the real-time PCR technology is its ability to quantitatively measure PCR products in real-time. When there is an increase in the PCR product being generated in a given cycle, there is a corresponding increase in the fluorescent signal being released. However, the real-time PCR is limited in its multiplexing capabilities. The limitation comes from both the methodology itself and the platform. From the methodology standpoint, multiplexing requires multiple sets of primers to function in the same reaction environment. These conditions demand a degree of compatibility that is difficult to achieve. Regarding the platform, multiplexing with real-time PCR requires that fluorescent probes have different colors. Moreover, the different colors must be detected by different means. As result of these limitations, developing multiplex panels with real-time PCR technology is very problematic.",

During the SARS outbreak of 2003, an MD 2 system was rapidly developed by Genaco and used in Beijing (Ma et al., 2004) . Tables 27.5 and 27.6 list the pathogens identified by the MDD systems for Respiratory Infections I and II. We group these pathogens into two panels: the first panel includes pathogens with DNA genomes, and the second panel includes viruses with RNA genomes. Amplification for the DNA panel needs only a PCR step; whereas the RNA panel needs a one-step or two-step RT-PCR reaction before undergoing Templex PCR. Dean et al. (2005) reported that, if a random-primed reverse transcription step is added before performing Templex, the sensitivity is at, or close to, that of singleplex real-time PCR. If however, a one-step RT-PCR enzyme system is used for Templex PCR, the sensitivity is about two logs less than that of a comparable singleplex real-time PCR reaction. For the MDD system for Respiratory Infections II (the DNA panel), Templex PCR is also less sensitive compared with the real-time PCR method (Fields et al., 2005, personal communication Tables 27.7 and 27.8 show sample data generated by the two panels. Pathogen nucleic acid was isolated from ATCC strains or provided by the CDC. Each column indicates a pathogen target, and each row represents a sample. The numbers in the MFI table are (Medium Fluorescent Intensity) values obtained from a Luminex 100 machine. Positive results are indicated in bold. The theoretical cutoff for each target is the mean of the negative results plus five times the standard deviation. To ensure high assay specificity, we suggest using a universal cutoff of 250 MFI for all targets. Highly specific results were obtained without the denaturation of PCR products. No post-PCR clean-up or posthybridization washes were necessary. In general, the single-tube Templex PCR reaction is complete in about 3.5 h. After performing the multiplex PCR, 5 \u03bcL of PCR product is mixed with color-coded beads (covalently coupled with pathogen target-specific capture probes) and hybridized for 15 min at 52 \u2022 C. Streptavidin-PE is added to introduce a fluorescent label to the PCR products and then hybridized for another 10 min. A stopping buffer is added before analysis with the Luminex instrument.

Today, there is an increasing concern over the threat of an encephalitis outbreak. In fall 1999, the first recognized outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States occurred in New York City. Initially, it took weeks before the pathogen was identified. The spread of the virus in 2002 resulted in the largest arboviral outbreak ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. WNV activity was reported in 44 U.S. states and in 5 Canadian provinces, and the outbreak resulted in more than 4500 human cases and 288 deaths. The course of this illness is unpredictable. Generally, the initial symptoms are flu-like, and, with other methods, diagnosis is difficult and often only successful with the onset of full-blown encephalitis. Therefore, quick and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Genaco has developed a molecular differential diagnostic system for viral encephalitis that can help pinpoint the source of the infection and provide physicians and public health officials with a better means of managing this disease.",

Louie et al. (2002) reported the development of a multiplex PCR assay that identifies three genes (nuc, mecA, and bacterial 16S rRNA genes) for the differentiation of MSSA and MRSA. Samples were collected from blood culture bottles, and PCR products were analyzed using gel electrophoresis. Francois et al.

Using Templex technology to amplify 18 molecular targets, the system can identify and differentiate among CoNS (identify four most common CoNSs), MRCoNS (methicillin-resistant CoNS), MSSA, MRSA, CA-MRSA, and HA-MRSA. In addition, the system can also detect six common drug-resistance genes (mecA, aacA, ermA, ermC, tetM, and tetK) . Table 27 .21 shows the results of some sample data. The advances of genomic technology have changed the way we define diseases by transforming the definition from a phenotypic, syndromatic description of clinical presentations to a genotypic, molecular classification of underlying causes. Molecular differential diagnosis has become the hallmark of the 21st century medical practice. Every infectious disease starts with an invasion by a microorganism's genetic material into the human body. The expression of pathogen genes inside human cells can interrupt normal cellular function and induce systematic responses or clinical syndromes. The goal for infectious disease molecular differential diagnosis is to investigate all possible causes of a common clinical syndrome and identify the offending pathogen. To achieve this goal, we need a multiplex technology that uses one sample, one test, one technician, one machine, and a small amount of time to obtain multiple answers.",

This information is critical for aiding physicians in selecting the right treatment options for patients. With MDDs, personalized medicine becomes a reality. MDDs also directly link diagnosis with treatment. With proper diagnosis, older, inexpensive antibiotics may also still be used to treat patients effectively. Under prolonged exposure to antibiotics, bacteria often acquire resistance capabilities by gaining additional genes to modify or inhibit a drug's effectiveness. Also, bacteria may mutate a gene to avoid being targeted by a drug. As a trade-off, these genetic changes may be associated with reduced survival fitness (Wichelhaus et al. 2002) . Therefore, when the selective pressure is removed by withdrawing the antibiotic from the market, the bacteria may revert back to wild-type status and regain survival potential. This may once more render the bacteria vulnerable to the old antibiotic. So, instead of constantly battling bacteria by developing ever more expensive antibiotics, it may make sense to invest in \"battlefield intelligence\" (i.e., a molecular differential diagnostic tool) to better guide the treatment. Resistance is caused by the misuse of antibiotics, and lack of proper diagnosis is the reason for such misuse. Therefore, accurate diagnosis could reduce resistance while improving treatment.",

Regularly scheduled surveys of critical environments (such as the ICU), instruments, and health care providers will raise the level of awareness and identify problems early. When an outbreak of HAI occurs, MDDs can quickly identify the source of an infection, helping health care providers determine which patients should be isolated to prevent the spread of the microorganisms. In an increasing number of states, hospitals are required to publish their rate of HAI. The rate is calculated based on discharge records. However, some patients may be misclassified as having a HAI because they were asymptomatic carriers before being admitted to the hospital. MDDs can help hospitals better identify, control, and report HAIs, thereby lessening their liability.

Depending on how you measure it, the health care industry represents between 15% and 16% of the gross domestic product. Traditionally, these financial activities occurred in three subcategories: providers (such as hospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic laboratories), payers (such as insurance companies), and life sciences (such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals). The cost of developing a new drug can be as high as $800 million (Adams and Brantner, 2004) . That cost is passed on from the life science sector to the payers and then to the providers.

Society is threatened by emerging infectious diseases, including many drug resistant \"super bugs.\" The global economy, with its traveling professionals, makes the spread of diseases much faster. Rising costs make quality health care more difficult to manage. The cost of developing new antibiotics is too high and the process is too slow. We have been promised a better system and have been awaiting the arrival of MDDs for a long time. Now that the technology has finally arrived, we must maximize its utility and benefit.",

Using current culture methods, patients and physicians often need to wait for days before a result is available. Singleplex molecular analyses are labor intensive, expensive, and often inconclusive. A powerful multiplex technology like Templex provides a fast answer that leads to a faster recovery. The ultimate value of MDDs is found in its ability to save lives.",
