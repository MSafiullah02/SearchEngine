This has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of sequences contributed by both large sequencing centres and individual laboratories to sequence databases. Public biological sequence databases are growing at an ever-increasing rate, with 9 million new sequences being added to GenBank from August 2002 to August 2003 alone [1]. Currently, the GenBank database has almost 42 billion nucleotides from over 32 million sequences. The number of whole genome sequences of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses is also increasing rapidly. Accordingly, tools like NCBI BLAST, which search those databases for sequences similar to a given query sequence, return larger and larger sets of results.",

ReHAB performs PSI-BLAST [2] searches of a protein sequence database and keeps a database of all significant alignments (\"hits\") obtained; these searches are performed on a regular schedule against updated versions of the sequence database. It then compares the sequences in the new PSI-BLAST result with the ReHAB hits database to identify new matches resulting from recently deposited sequences. The complete ReHAB hits database can then be queried by date using a simple GUI to allow the researcher to easily identify new hits; these are highlighted, and pairwise or multiple alignments can be performed to assess the quality of the match. As well as filtering out results that have been found previously, the ReHAB browser can filter out hits against sequences that are identical to the sequences being submitted as queries (such as orthologs of the query sequence).",

For example, our laboratory uses it with all open reading frames (ORFs) from fully sequenced poxvirus genomes (over 7000 query sequences). As the number of sequenced virus genomes continues to increase, the number of hypothetical ORFs of unknown function also expands. This is particularly true for large viruses like poxviruses, baculoviruses, and herpesviruses that possess many virulence genes that are not part of the core set of genes that define a virus family [3]. There are also numerous core genes for which no known function has yet been identified; for example, of 49 completely conserved protein families in poxviruses, there are 11 with completely unknown function and at least 5 others with only poorly defined function.",

Each of these components is described in more detail below. Although all components can be run on a single machine, it is envisioned that a single server will support a variety of users dispersed on an intranet or the Internet; if required, it is simple to offload the batch database searching to a more powerful cluster or grid system.",

To reduce the amount of required storage space, actual alignments are not stored, but are regenerated for presentation when the user selects the specific query sequence or query-target pair to be viewed. Query sequences, which are entered using a simple FASTA-like format that includes additional annotation information in the identifying line, need only be submitted once to ReHAB since they are stored for future search cycles.",

PSI-BLAST is performed for three iterations without filtering procedures (such as for low-complexity regions). Hits with an E-value less than 0.001 are used to generate the scoring matrix for the subsequent cycle. To increase speed, searches with query sequences that result in no new hits are terminated after the first cycle. Those with new hits scoring below the threshold continue to the third cycle. PSI-BLAST was chosen because it is a more sensitive search method than BLASTP. The searches do not need to be performed on the same machine on which the database or server components are installed. XML output from blastpgp is parsed and relevant information about each hit is stored in the ReHAB database. In addition to scores and identifying information, target sequences are copied into the ReHAB database to ensure that they are available for analysis in the future, even if they are no longer available from NCBI. This is important because, although NCBI does not actually remove sequences from its database, it may change the identifier of a sequence if it is corrected, updated, or merged with another identical entry. Any changes to a pre-existing entry are added to the database, but it is not registered as a new hit.",

It allows the researcher to ask the question: \"what new sequences match my sequences since the last time I searched?\" In the example of our work, the query sequences are all the ORFs of the fully sequenced poxvirus genomes (36 genomes, 7075 query sequences). These sequences are used to query the NR NCBI protein database and a MySQL database of all hits is generated and stored (Figure 2). Databases of hits for other virus families maintained by The Virus Bioinformatics Resource (TVBR; herpesviruses, baculoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses) will also be available in the near future. The hits database can then be accessed by double-clicking on the database name or by selecting \"browse by organism\" in the Action menu. This opens a new window to present browsing, sorting, and highlighting options (Figure 3). The user can browse by organism name, such as \"Variola Virus strain Bangladesh-1975\". To highlight recent hits, the \"date option\" is chosen to define the date after which the hits are considered new. The available dates are those on which the query sequences were searched against a then current NR NCBI database. The output can be sorted based on three criteria (name, new hit date, or maximum new hit bit-score) by selecting the appropriate radio button. The results are presented in a new window, using colors to indicate new hits (Figure 4).",

The pairwise alignment can be displayed rapidly by clicking on the score (a hyperlink). In contrast to the usual BLAST output, which presents the local alignment found by BLAST, a global alignment produced by Needle [12,13] is shown. More information can be obtained about the target sequence by clicking on the link to the NCBI file for that entry. Alternatively, a full list of hits can be viewed in the \"Hits Manager\" window (Figure 5b). Here, sequences can be sorted by highlight, and pairwise or multiple alignments can be performed. Pairwise alignments are displayed by selecting a single target sequence and clicking the \"Global\" button for global alignments produced by the EMBOSS program Needle or the \"Local\" button for local alignments generated by the EMBOSS program Water [12,14]. Multiple alignments are generated by selecting more than one target sequence and clicking the \"Base-By-Base\" button; the software automatically retrieves the appropriate sequences from the ReHAB hits database, performs a ClustalW alignment and passes the resulting multiple alignment to Base-By-Base, which functions as an alignment viewer and editor [9].

ReHAB can block the highlighting of hit sequences that are also present in the query database when the \"Don't Show My Own Sequences\" option is selected; such sequences will not be shown or highlighted in the Hits Results window. However, these sequences and their alignments with the query can still be visualized in the HTML Report and Hits Manager windows, thus allowing the user to access all the available information. This feature becomes essential when new poxvirus genomes are added to the public database, since a large fraction of the queries will hit proteins in the new genome and signal a \"new hit\" report when there may be no other new hits in the database. Although these are clearly high scoring matches, they are expected and therefore must be masked in the analysis if the full value of ReHAB is to be realized.",

For example, a research group could organize query sequences and the hits results databases by laboratory name, and browsing of results could be by the researcher's name (Figure 6). Individual laboratory members would add query sequences to the database including their name in the identifying information line. In this example, the laboratory name would replace virus family, and user names would replace organism names. All query sequences would be searched in the same batch process, and each individual could then browse their sequences of interest.
