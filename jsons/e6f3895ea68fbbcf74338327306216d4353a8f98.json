It contains the HE gene, which characterizes the group 2 coronaviruses, and has a very intriguing feature consisting of a variable number of tandem copies of a 30-bp repeat region that codes for a highly acidic domain (ATR) in ORF1a (nsp1 region). Despite the high number of cell cultures inoculated with respiratory samples, HCoV-HKU1 could not be recovered from cell culture [4] . No cytopathic effect was observed, and RT-PCR performed on the culture supernatant and cell lysates showed a lack of viral replication. Isolating HCoV on cell culture is very difficult. HCoV prototype strains 229E, OC43, and NL63 can replicate in MRC5 cells, HRT18 cells, and LLC-MK2 cells, respectively, but there are still few primary isolates. Woo et al. [4] reported that SARS-CoV can be recovered only from !20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV. There is no other report to date concerning the detection of HCoV-HKU1.

HUH7 cells were inoculated with respiratory samples collected from 135 patients hospitalized in February and March 2005 at the University Hospital of Caen (Caen, France). The age distribution of the tested patients was as follows: 83 patients (61.5%) were !5 years of age, 6 patients (4.4%) were 6-20 years of age, and 46 patients (34.1%) were 121 years of age. The tested respiratory specimens were obtained from patients with respiratory symptoms and then were sent to the laboratory for viral diagnosis. The patients or, in the case of minors, the parents or legal guardians of the patients consented to having their samples tested for respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. The samples were processed routinely for immunofluorescence direct antigen assay using monoclonal antibodies against influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, and 3; and adenovirus (Imagen). All samples had negative results. It is part of our strategy to inoculate samples with negative results onto a cell culture system (HUH7 cell line) [5] . In this protocol, HuH7 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with glutamine with 5% fetal calf serum (Gibco; Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and gentamycin (50 mg/mL), and were distributed in 48-well tissue culture microplates. When HUH7 cells were 80% confluent, the growth medium was discarded and each well was inoculated with 100 mL of the clinical samples. Microplates were centrifugated at 1500 rpm for 30 min at 30\u040aC. Samples were then removed, and each well was filled with 1 mL of the same culture medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (Gibco; Invitrogen). By day 4 after onset of infection, HuH7 cells were examined for cytopathic effect and the supernatant were used for amplification techniques. Cytopathic effect characteristics are as follows: small cells, no refringent, cells scattered on the culture, and a progressive lysis of the cell sheet. The RNA was extracted using the High pure RNA isolation kit (Roche) and tested with RT-PCR techniques previously described and used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, influenza virus C, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63 [6, 7] . A 1-step HCoV-HKU1 RT-PCR amplification of a 443-bp fragment was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and the following primers set defined in N gene from the GenBank sequence database (accession number AY597011): HKU1 sens (5 -ACCAATCTGAGCGAAATTACCAAAC-3 ) and HKU1 antisense (5 -CGGAAACCTAGTAGGGATAGCTT-3 ). The reac-tion was undertaken using OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each RT-PCR test was performed using the usual precautions to avoid contamination. No cross-reaction of this RT-PCR assay was observed with the other classical HCoV. The assay was performed without a positive control. RT-PCR products were processed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. The positive results were confirmed by sequencing from the amplified product and by RT-PCR performed directly with use of the respiratory specimens. For 2 patients with results positive for detection of HCoV-HKU1 in respiratory specimens, stool samples obtained at the same time were available and have been tested. Two other RT-PCR assays were performed using the specimen that was positive for HCoV-HKU1 detection, one of which involved amplification of a 713-bp fragment with S1 gene-specific primers HKU1-S1 sens (5 -ACCACAGTTCCTCGCATAAGT-3 ) and HKU1-S1 antisense (5 -AGATATTGGCGTTTAGAC-3 ), the other amplifying a variable size fragment with primers defining on both sides of the highly acidic domain in ORF1a (ATR-HKU1 sens: 5 -AATGGCCTCTCGTATGTAT-3 ; ATR-HKU1 antisense: 5 -TTACAAGTAACACAGAACGCA-3 ). The RT-PCR products were sequenced, and the obtained nucleotide sequences of the partial S1 gene were compared with the prototype strain sequences available in GenBank. The alignments were prepared using Clustal X, version 1.83. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method, and bootstrap values were determined by 1000 replicates. We used HCoV-OC43 as an outgroup. The medical records were examined retrospectively for the 6 patients with test results positive for HCoV-HKU1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1191, "end": 1194, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2304, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2305, "end": 2307, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MATERIALS AND METHODS"}, {"text": "Among the 135 cell cultures tested with RT-PCR, the positive samples consisted of 10 coronaviruses (6 positive for HCoV-HKU1, 2 positive for HCoV-NL63, and 2 positive for HCoV-OC43), 23 rhinoviruses, 1 enterovirus, and 1 influenza virus C. There were 2 codetections, one of which consisted of HCoV-HKU1 and influenza virus C, and the other of which consisted of rhinovirus and HCoV-OC43. To eliminate cell culture contamination, the N gene HCoV-HKU1 RT-PCR was performed directly on the respiratory specimens obtained from the 6 patients. All of these specimens, as well as the stool samples available for 2 of these patients, were found to have positive results. The 443-bp amplicon resulting from the amplification of the partial N gene was sequenced for 6 of the 8 specimens with positive results (GenBank accession numbers DQ131635-DQ131641) (figure 1). Our isolates shared 98%-100% nucleotide identity with the same region of the HCoV-HKU1 reference strain. We then sequenced the 713-bp amplicon corresponding to partial spike gene of 4 positive specimens. Genetic sequences from other positive specimens could not be obtained, because the primers used for the amplification of the partial spike gene did not amplify a PCR product of sufficient quantity to allow for reliable genetic sequencing analysis. The phylogenetic analysis of 603-bp of these sequences (GenBank accession numbers DQ131642-DQ131645) shows that our isolates form a group containing sequences with different markers and that there is no cross-contamination between the different isolates. Three of these isolates clustered with the prototype strain described in Hong Kong. One isolate (DQ131645) had characteristics of an outlier (figure 2). To determine if our isolates contained a variable number of tandem copies of 30bp repeat region-the significant feature of HCoV-HKU1-we sequenced amplicon resulting from a RT-PCR of the region of ORF1a. To confirm the number of ATRs, this test was conducted several times for 2 isolates. The results show that there were 7 and 8 ATRs in the 2 isolates tested, compared with 11 and 14 ATRs recorded in the 2 Hong Kong isolates [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2144, "end": 2147, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "HCoV-HKU1 was detected in nasal and stool samples obtained from 6 patients, 4 of whom were male, and 2 of whom were female (table 1).

Three of them (patients 1, 2, and 6) were admitted to the hospital for severe dehydration due to fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Upper respiratory symptoms (rhinitis, pharyngitis, or otitis) were also reported. Unfortunately, no stool samples for these patients were available in the hospital. Patient 4 had a febrile seizure and otitis. Both respiratory and stool samples tested positive for HCoV-HKU1.

HCoV-HKU1 is a previously unrecognized group 2 coronavirus. The clinical significance of this viral infection was made evident in the index patient by the combined evolution of clinical symptoms, viral loads in the respiratory samples, and development of a specific antibody response. This index patient was a 71-year-old Chinese man with poor underlying conditions (pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by bronchiectasis, a history of being a chronic smoker, and obstructive airway disease). He was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia and was discharged after 5 days of hospitalization. However, respiratory, stool, and urine samples were collected from him weekly for a 5-week period. The viral load in respiratory specimens decreased during the second week of the illness and was undetectable in the third week. The decrease in viral load was accompanied by recovery from the illness and development of a specific antibody response.

The choice of HUH7 cells was made because some studies showed that these cells appear to have a broad spectrum, allowing for the detection of a wide range of viruses, including coronaviruses 229E, OC43, and MHV [8] [9] [10] . Unfortunately, we failed to amplify HCoV-HKU1 on HUH7 cells by serial passage. At first passage, we could see a cytopathic effect on day 4. However, because of the lack of specific antibodies against HCoV-HKU1, we could not test HUH7 cells to know whether there were infected cells showing viral replication. So, the HCoV-HKU1 RNA detected by RT-PCR may be a residual virus from a clinical sample or a virus amplified in cell culture in the first passage on HUH7 cells. The duration of incubation is limited to 4 days, which may be insufficient for the growth of coronaviruses. More experiments are being conducted to adapt HKU1 strains to cell line. Six patients were infected with HCoV-HKU1, including 5 children and 1 adult. Because samples were obtained mainly from pediatric departments, 61.5% of the tested patients were children.

The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method, and bootstrap values were determined by 1000 replicates in Clustal X, version 1.83. To construct the tree, the reference strain HCoV-HKU1 (NC006577) was included. HCoV-OC43 is used as the outgroup. [2, 8, 9, 10] . Our study only suggests that HCoV-HKU1 could also have a winter seasonality in these regions. A better understanding of the epidemiology of different HCoV in different parts of the world could contribute to better management of the molecular and serological diagnosis of future emerging or reemerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV. Because of the lack of a systematized selection of the tested samples, the patients with positive results are presented as case reports. It should be noted that one-half of the patients were admitted to the hospital not for respiratory illnesses, but for gastroenteritis resulting in severe dehydration associated with upper respiratory symptoms. In effect, previous studies have suggested that coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV may be involved in enteric diseases, despite the fact that there is no clear evidence that they cause enteric illness [9, [11] [12] [13] . This would not be surprising in view of the clear involvement of SARS-CoV and some animal coronavirus strains in severe diarrheal diseases. We have shown that HCoV-HKU1 can be detected in stool samples. Nevertheless, further studies must be conducted to confirm the potential dual tropism (respiratory and enteric) of this group 2 coronavirus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 453, "end": 457, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1743, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1746, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1749, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1753, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2634, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2639, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2644, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2649, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1341, "end": 1349, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "HCoV-HKU1 was also detected in 2 patients without acute symptoms and with poor underlying conditions (patients 3 and 5). Although HCoV (except SARS-CoV) were generally associated with acute and self-limiting respiratory infections, this detection of viral RNA can be related to a persistent or asymptomatic chronic infection. Chiu et al. [14] reported a repeated detection of HCoV-229E in an immunocompromised child 13 months old. The genetic analysis of a 305-bp region of the spike protein region of 229E revealed that these 3 specimens had identical genetic sequences, providing evidence of virus persistence rather than reinfection. Patient 6, who tested positive for HCoV-HKU1, had an influenza C virus detected in the same clinical specimen. It is not possible to determine whether this is true coinfection or whether 1 of the viruses represents continued shedding from a previous infection. It is interesting to note that the genome of group 2 coronaviruses and influenza C virus both contain the HE gene. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C have a common ancestral origin. Because HCoV and influenza C virus infect similar tissues, the significant sequence homology between the HE genes of the 2 viruses suggests that coinfection followed by recombination could have occurred in the past [4, 15] . The expression of the HE gene has been shown to be heterogeneous in different species of group 2 coronaviruses. The biological significance of HE protein is not well understood. Further experiments have to be performed to determine the essentiality and function of HE in HCoV-HKU1, especially in cell tropism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 342, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1346, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1350, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we report a molecular method allowing for the detection of the new coronavirus HKU1.
