KAOS goal modelling is a software engineering approach that allows to identify high level goals of an organisation, refine and expand them into lower-level more concrete goals and assign them to specific system agents. The two approaches can be combined, such that the goal modelling is used to derive specific goals rooted in the organisational context, policies and strategies of an organisation. The GQM, in turn, utilises the derived specific goals to produce appropriate and meaningful metrics that can be used to obtain valuable insights and track the state and progress of the formulated goals. Moreover, both models can be presented within a single diagram, thus providing an expressive and concise overview of the systems goals, actors and measurements. The suggested combination is then applied in the context of an open source project, followed by the discussion on potential benefits and drawbacks of using the two approaches.",

Within the goal a purpose is defined, together with a particular quality issue of the object and a viewpoint from which it is looked at. The example goal is to improve usability of the ticket booking feature from the point of view of a person booking a ticket (end user). The object of the goal is the ticket booking feature. The purpose is to improve, the quality issue is the usability and the viewpoint is that of a person booking a ticket.

The question arises then of how the set of specific goals for an organisation is actually produced. In fact, the team constructing GQMs needs to accomplish a thorough work of understanding the context of the organisation itself, its mission, strategy, policy and high level goals. The team also needs to understand the local context of the object being measured, which can be a product or some process within a project. Finally, viewpoints of various stakeholders need to be taken into consideration to serve as another important element formulating the goals. The whole process involves interviewing stakeholders, analysing the environment and collaboration between the corporate management, project and GQM team. The derived goals need to be analysed with regards to their relevancy and relation to the high level goals [2] .",

            "text": "If there are two or more blank circle coming out of a single goal, like in the case of the GenerateRevenue goal, it denotes that the children connected through the circles are alternative ways of satisfying the goal. It is referred to as or-refinement. The case in-between, not present in the example diagram, is referred to as incomplete and-refinement, which has the meaning that only some and not all the child goals need to be achieved in order to satisfy the parent goal. It is denoted by a single blank circle pointing an arrow at the parent goal, with several lines coming out of it and connecting the circle with the child goals. 3. Having system goals in one place, allows one to analyse the goals and to identify and denote the conflict between the goals on different levels. A lightning bolt shape connection is used for that, as can be observed in the case of two apparently conflicting goals from the example: ChargeJobSeekers and M aintain [F reeF orJobSeekers] . Together with identifying conflict, the goal model approach suggest various mechanisms of resolving the conflicts [1]. 4. As can observed, the goals on the third level have the prefix Maintain before them. This comes from the notion of behavioural and soft goals used in KAOS. Behavioural goals are preceded by prefixes such as Achieve, Maintain and Avoid, and denote some logical constraints on the behaviour of the system. Achieve means that the goal has to be achieved at some point, and often comes with a conditional close dictating when it should be achieved. Maintain defines that some desirable state needs to be up-kept in the system at all times, while avoid means the opposite, i.e. that some state must never occur. Soft goals, in turn, denote other less stringent conditions on the system, and use prefixes such as maximise, minimise. This technique of defining various types of goals provides an expressive and fairly flexible tool of conveying constraints on the system and its environment through the goal statements.",

An obstacle obstructing that goal, i.e. preventing its satisfaction, would be exposure of some sensitive user data. The obstacle is further refined into two alternative sub-obstacles, and then countermeasures for both of them are found. According to the notation the crossed arrows denote obstruction and resolution relationships. An attentive eye will also notice that obstacles are represented inside a horizontally flipped parallelogram, which signals that obstacles are opposite of goals. 2. There is a table on the right of the SensitiveDataExposed obstacle, providing additional details such as the definition, category, likelihood, criticality and even a formal specification expressed using predicate logic. Such tables can be provided for any goals or obstacles, that need an extra level of detail or clarification. 3. Yet, the aspect of biggest interest is the fact that the lowest level goals are attached to hexagons, which represent agents. Agents can be software modules, individuals or devices. Individuals are normally denoted with a human figure, while non-human agents are denoted with titles only. This is one of the key aspects of the goal model, since it allows to attach each goal on the lowest level to an agent, thus connecting the strategic goals with the system or environmental elements responsible for satisfying them. Normally, each low-level goal will have one agent responsible for fulfilling it. In cases when a goal has several agents, the possibility of further refining the goal should be considered. On the other hand, if an agent is responsible for too many goals, the refinement and better definition of the agent should be considered too.",

The most important thing to note, is that the goal model diagram provides a concise and comprehensive way of visually conveying the context and derivation process of the low-level specific goals used for constructing GQMs. Interestingly, GQMs can also be constructed for higher level goals, in particular for M aximise [CustomerRetention] , IncreaseN umberOf Bookings and Achieve [CustomerAcquisition] . For example, the customer retention goal calls for a question of \"Do the users come back to make repeat bookings through the service?\", for which a simple metric can be provided as an answer, namely \"Percentage of returning users making repeat bookings\". The fact that the GQM can be used to measure the achievement and state of goals at various levels, implies that the GQM metrics can enhance the goal model approach, especially when it comes to soft goals. The very formulation of soft goals using verbs such as Maximise, Minimise and Optimise calls for metrics to be used in order to track the state of the system, and declare concrete satisfaction criteria for these goals.",
