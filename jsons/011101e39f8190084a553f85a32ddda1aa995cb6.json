Earlier initiation of antibiotics had a greater impact than antibiotic choice. These factors have led to a change in the IDSA guidelines.

HAP is defined as pneumonia that occurs 48 h or more after hospital admission. HCAP is defined as including any patient who was hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 d of the development of the current pneumonia; any patient residing in a nursing home or long-term care facility; any patient who has received recent intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care (in the last 30 d); or who has attended a hemodialysis unit.

If cultures are positive, adjust antibiotic therapy and reassess diagnosis, and look for complications. ii. If cultures are negative, look for other pathogens and reassess diagnosis, and look for complications. The choice of antibiotics is influenced by the likelihood of MDR pathogens. The guidelines suggest that for HAP, VAP, or HCAP, which occurs as late-onset (>5 d after admission) disease or which have risk factors for MDR pathogens (essentially all HCAP as defined earlier), patients should receive broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for MDR organisms. Combination antibiotic therapy is recommended for this group, as listed in Table 1 . The guidelines note that no data exist to document the superiority of combination antibiotic therapy when compared with monotherapy, but combination therapy increases the chances of selecting at least one effective antibiotic during initial treatment. In selecting antibiotics for patients who have recently received antibiotics, it is preferable to select an antibiotic from a different class than the antibiotic the patient was just on. If the patient's regimen includes an aminoglycoside, the aminoglycoside can be stopped after 5-7 d if the patient is responding. Duration of treatment can be as short as 7 d in patients with a good clinical response who do not have a documented infection with P. aeruginosa. Clinical improvement usually takes 48-72 h and so therapy should not be changed in that time period unless there is clinical decline. In patients who respond to treatment, therapy can be narrowed on the basis of cultures.",
