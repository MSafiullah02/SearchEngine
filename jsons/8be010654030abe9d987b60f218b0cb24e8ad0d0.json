The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in the management of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. Methods: The present study will be conducted as an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at four consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. Discussion: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.

[1] In humans, infection by four coronaviruses, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, usually lead to mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. [2] However, other coronaviruses, such as those associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), may cause severe respiratory disease, and have caused a total of more than 10,000 laboratory-confirmed cases globally in the past two decades, with a 10% and 34.4% case-fatality rate, respectively. [3, 4] In December 2019, a novel coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical manifestations in humans resembling that of viral pneumonia. [5] By February 25, 2020 , about 77,780 confirmed cases have been identified in China, with 2666 deaths. Worryingly, 2459 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) have now been identified outside of China. [6] Symptoms of infection are non-specific, and include fever, cough, and myalgia, [7] with diarrhea, with or without the subsequent development of dyspnea. [8] Severe cases with respiratory distress, sepsis, and septic shock have been reported. [9] During the SARS epidemic of 2003, therapeutic systemic glucocorticoids were widely administered in patients who were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV), and who subsequently developed severe respiratory disease. One cohort study of patients during the SARS outbreak showed that the use of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with clinical improvement in patients with SARS. [10] In another study of 20 patients with SARS, certain cytokine levels (interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and Th1 chemokine interferon-g-inducible protein-10) were found to be reduced after 5 to 8 days of glucocorticoid therapy. [11] However, a previous retrospective study indicated that pulsed doses of methylprednisolone was a risk factor associated with increased 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.4-154.8; P = 0.001). [12] In addition, a further retrospective observational study found that glucocorticoid therapy in patients with MERS was associated with delayed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance.

Systemic glucocorticoid therapy could be considered for critically ill patients with COVID-19, but their impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain. [16] Available data on systemic glucocorticoid therapy among coronavirus-infected patients mainly comes from studies of patients with SARS and MERS, but whether glucocorticoid therapy is definitively beneficial in the clinical management of these two coronavirus infections is still being debated. [13, 20, 21] Glucocorticoid therapy was used in the treatment of severe SARS because early anecdotal experience supported it, and radiologic findings and histologic features of critically ill patients with SARS were similar to those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). [22] [23] [24] [25] As early as March 2003, China first summarized its experience in the management of SARS, and suggested that high-dose glucocorticoids should be used if patients had fever persisting for more than 3 days, or radiologic findings were suggestive of persistent lung involvement or progressive deterioration. [26] There were three different regimens used by physicians in Hong Kong, China including methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg qid or 2-4 mg/kg tid IV followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and of disparate dosages, as per clinical evaluation), hydrocortisone (2 mg/kg qid or 4 mg/kg tid IV followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and doses as per clinical evaluation), and pulsed methylprednisolone (500 mg IV daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg bid, reduced to 20-30 mg daily on day 21 and as per clinical evaluation). [27] Some suggested glucocorticoid therapeutic doses during the SARS outbreak were very high, approximating the treatment doses for acute severe asthma, and some prescribed doses were similar to those prescribed for organ rejection in transplant patients, or for ARDS. [23] One study compared pulsed glucocorticoid therapy (methylprednisolone \u2265500 mg/day) with non-pulsed glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone <500 mg/day) therapy, finding that pulsed glucocorticoid therapy appeared to be a more efficacious, with patients using pulsed glucocorticoid therapy having lower oxygen requirements, better radiographic outcomes, and decreased likelihood of requiring rescue. Unfortunately, the stated study was not a randomized controlled trial, and is thus open to the possibility of bias having an impact on outcomes. [23] However, there were also staunch advocates for not using systemic glucocorticoids in these patients. One systematic review of studies on patients with SARS-CoV, including 29 studies documenting glucocorticoid use, found 25 studies that were inconclusive regarding the role of the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids, and four studies demonstrated that the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with SARS may cause possible harm. [28] A prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial compared early hydrocortisone treatment (before day 7 of the illness) with placebo, finding that early hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load. [18] Meanwhile, many possible complications of glucocorticoid use, such as profound immunosuppression, with the possible emergence of severe commensal and other viral and bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, osteonecrosis, and psychosis may occur with prolonged and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Glucocorticoid therapy was also commonly used for critically ill patients with MERS. In one study, hypoxemic patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia who had moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure were initiated on glucocorticoid therapy. [13] In these patients, there was no difference in 90-day mortality, and these patients were associated with delayed MERS-CoV RNA clearance. Many patients with severe MERS were treated with systemic high-dose glucocorticoids intending to reverse the progression of respiratory distress and to prevent lung Chinese Medical Journal 2020;Vol(No) www.cmj.org fibrosis. However, this approach has not been proven to be successful. [35] One study, including a total of 314 patients with symptomatic MERS-CoV, found that glucocorticoid use was associated with increased mortality in these patients. [36] A retrospective cohort study compared 151 patients in the glucocorticoid group with 158 patients in the non-glucocorticoid group, finding that mortality in the glucocorticoid group was similar to that of the nonglucocorticoid group, but that glucocorticoid therapy was associated with delayed MERS-CoV RNA clearance, after adjustment for baseline and time-varying confounding factors. [13] After infection with 2019-nCoV occurs, some patients develop mild symptoms, but a significant fraction of patients progress to severe ARDS and require intensive care. [7, 37] The use of glucocorticoids in patients with ARDS is still controversial because of divergent results in the existing literature. [38] High-dose glucocorticoid is one of the most frequently used adjuncts in ARDS (17.9%) in 50 countries, even though their effectiveness in the management of acute lung injury is not yet clear. [39] One systematic review conducted an analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials, and demonstrated that compared with the placebo group, prolonged glucocorticoid treatment did improve clinical outcomes. [40] Another randomized controlled trial showed that glucocorticoid therapy could down-regulate ARDS-related inflammation, and was associated with significant improvements in lung and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, as well as reduce mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit hospital admission duration. [41] Studies by Meduri et al [42, 43] found that prolonged methylprednisolone treatment may complement positive modulation of systemic inflammation by inducing recovery from induced glucocorticoid resistance, and co-existing decreased production of endogenous glucocorticoids. [42, 43] Animal experiments in recent years have provided evidence for the use of glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation, the attenuation of acute lung injury, and reduction in mortality during the acute phase of severe disease. [44, 45] However, other studies have suggested that glucocorticoid therapy in ARDS is not necessary, and may even aggravate the clinical picture. The use of hydrocortisone improves lung function in sepsis-associated ARDS, but no significant survival benefit has been observed in these patients. [46] A higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with ARDS who took high-dose glucocorticoids within 7 days after hospital admission, compared with those who were treated without high-dose glucocorticoid. [47] Existing studies on ARDS have not assessed the effects of glucocorticoids in identical types of patients, or identical processes of the disease. [48] Therefore, the results for these studies cannot be considered to be congruent. Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in specific diseases causing ARDS, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, has been shown to reduce mortality in adult patients. [49] Additionally, the dosage of the glucocorticoid used needs to be factored in.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 57, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 413, "end": 417, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 716, "end": 719, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 720, "end": 723, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1024, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1333, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1897, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2162, "end": 2166, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2709, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3143, "end": 3147, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3400, "end": 3404, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3713, "end": 3717, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3718, "end": 3722, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3723, "end": 3727, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3728, "end": 3732, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3733, "end": 3737, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3738, "end": 3742, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3987, "end": 3991, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 4413, "end": 4417, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4579, "end": 4583, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4969, "end": 4973, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 5141, "end": 5144, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 5145, "end": 5148, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 5278, "end": 5282, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 5474, "end": 5478, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 5695, "end": 5699, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 6016, "end": 6020, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 6045, "end": 6049, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 6050, "end": 6053, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 6293, "end": 6297, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 6298, "end": 6301, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 6522, "end": 6526, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 6527, "end": 6530, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 6817, "end": 6821, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 7032, "end": 7036, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 7182, "end": 7186, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 7431, "end": 7435, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "High-dose glucocorticoid therapy may increase ventilator dependence, and may possibly induce a worse outcome.
