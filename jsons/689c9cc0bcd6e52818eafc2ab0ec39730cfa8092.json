Here we derive the optimal time-limited intervention for reducing peak epidemic prevalence in the standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. We show that alternative, more practical interventions can perform nearly as well as the provably optimal strategy. However, none of these strategies are robust to implementation errors: mistiming the start of the intervention by even a single week can be enormously costly, for realistic epidemic parameters. Sustained control measures, though less efficient than optimal and near-optimal time-limited interventions, can be used in combination with time-limited strategies to mitigate the catastrophic risks of mistiming.",

It can take months to develop drugs, and years to develop vaccines [4] .

To eradicate the pathogen, we must sustain R e < 1 (so that each currently infectious person tends to produce less than one subsequent infection) for sufficient time to eliminate all cases.

This point can be hastened-and the number of infections at that point thereby reduced-if the number of susceptible individuals in the population is depleted. This is why time-limited intensive interventions cannot begin too early if they are to minimize the peak. Locking down transmission too early and too aggressively slows the depletion of susceptibles. If controls are then relaxed too soon, there will be a large second epidemic peak [2] . This gives us some intuition for the importance of timing, and for the properties of the optimal intervention: it must trade off depletion of susceptible pool against reduction in the rate at which people become infectious. We formalize this by finding a provably optimal peak-reduction strategy for the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model [6] .

Any intervention that brings I max < c necessarily sets that area to 0, but when choosing among strategies that cannot reduce I max below c, the strategy that minimizes I max will not necessarily minimize A. It might be preferable to permit a slightly higher peak but then take a full suppression approach, leading to a spike with small area above healthcare capacity. In general, however, we observe that as c approaches I max , the problem of minimizing the area A becomes almost identical to the problem of minimizing I max . When c is far from I max , it is closer to the problem of minimizing the final size of the outbreak, and strategies designed for final size reduction [2] may be superior to strategies designed for peak reduction.",

With that in mind, a policymaker looking to salvage matters should take a full suppression approach. In fact, full suppression is good as any other strategy at minimizing I max whenever t i > t 0 i > t opt i , where t 0 i is the optimal t i for a full suppression intervention (Corollary 7), since I max will simply be I(t i ).

One possibility is that the policymaker directly observes S(t) throughout the intervention and chooses b(t) = \u03b3 \u03b2S(t) based on the directly observed S(t). We call this a state-tuned intervention. Alternatively, the policymaker plans to intervene at some value S i predicted to occur at t i and chooses the values b(t) knowing that if the intervention does indeed begin at S i = S(t i ), S(t) will equal S i \u2212 \u03b3I i (t \u2212 t i ) during the maintenance phase. The policymaker then chooses b(t) according to that predicted S(t). We call this a time-tuned intervention. When we study mistimed interventions in the main text, we use time-tuned intervention; we see time-tuned interventions as a more realistic model of how a maintain-suppress intervention, if possible at all, would in fact be implemented, since instantaneous epidemiological observation is not possible. If it were possible, it could in fact permit a timing error to be better mitigated than state-tuning itself allows-by choosing the optimal strategy conditional on intervening at the true (S i , I i ). Indeed, it can be seen that time-tuned interventions are in fact slightly more robust to mistiming than state-tuned interventions, as they are partially self-correcting where the state-tuned interventions are not (see main text section 6).",

For an SIR with full susceptibility as initial condition, it is the case that any optimal intervention with positive duration as defined by equation 3 has f < 1. In other words, the optimal intervention for an emerging pathogen (S(0) \u2192 1, I(0) \u2192 0) always has a total suppression phase. Also, For any R 0 \u2208 (1, \u221e) there is a \u03c4 crit such that the optimal intervention is always a full suppression intervention (f = 0) if \u03c4 < \u03c4 crit . Moreover, lim R0\u21921 \u03c4 crit = \u221e and lim R0\u2192\u221e \u03c4 crit = 0.",
