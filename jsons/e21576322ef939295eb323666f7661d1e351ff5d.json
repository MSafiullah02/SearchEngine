Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine how PEDV infection influenced growth performance and repartitioning of amino acids and energy in nursery pigs. A total of 32 barrows and gilts, approximately 1 wk post-wean (BW = 8.46 \u00b1 0.50 kg), and na\u00efve for PEDV were obtained, weighed, and allotted based on sex and BW to one of two treatments: 1) Control, PEDV na\u00efve and 2) PEDV-inoculated (PEDV) with eight pens of two pigs each per treatment. On day post-inoculation (dpi) 0, PEDV pigs were inoculated via intragastric gavage with PEDV isolate (USA/Iowa/18984/2013). Pig and feeder weights were recorded at dpi \u22127, 0, 5, and 20 in order to calculate ADG, ADFI, and G:F. Eight pigs per treatment were euthanized on dpi 5 and 20, and tissues and blood were collected. At dpi 5, all PEDV pigs were PCR positive for PEDV in feces. Overall, PEDV pigs tended (P < 0.10) to increase ADFI, which resulted in reduced (P < 0.05) feed efficiency. At dpi 5, PEDV pigs had reduced (P < 0.05) villus height and increased (P < 0.05) stem cell proliferation in the jejunum compared with Control pigs. Pigs inoculated with PEDV had increased (P < 0.05) serum haptoglobin and increased insulin-to-glucose ratios compared with Control pigs at dpi 5. Markers of muscle proteolysis were not different (P > 0.05) between treatments within dpi; however, at dpi 5, 20S proteasome activity was increased (P < 0.05) in longissimus dorsi of PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs. Liver and jejunum gluconeogenic enzyme activities were not different (P > 0.05) between treatments within dpi. Overall, PEDV-inoculated pigs did recover the absorptive capacity that was reduced during PEDV infection by increasing proliferation of intestinal stem cells. However, the energy and nutrients needed to recover the epithelium may be originating from available luminal nutrients instead of muscle proteolysis and gluconeogenesis.

The pathology induced by this pathogen may result in altered nutrient and energy partitioning. Previous research in nursery pigs has demonstrated that PEDV challenge results in reduced growth performance (Kim and Lee, 2014; Schweer et al., 2015b; Curry et al., 2017a) and whole-body protein accretion rates compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Curry et al., 2017a) . However, the mechanism of action for this observation has not been determined. Muscle is the largest store of protein in the body; thus, changes in either protein degradation or protein synthesis during infection may result in reduced whole-body protein accretion. In addition, increased muscle protein turnover or degradation may provide AA that can be used for protein synthesis or energy production in other tissues. Rhoads et al. (2007) demonstrated that during peak rotavirus infection in pigs, protein translation initiation machinery were more abundant in the intestine compared with muscle of na\u00efve counterparts.

A reduction in ADFI and ADG was expected based on results from previous work (Kim and Lee, 2014; Schweer et al., 2015b; Curry et al., 2017a) and because appetite and feed intake are generally reduced during an immune response (Johnson, 1998) . In swine production, there is wide variation of PEDV infection from subclinical, mild, to severe, and severe with co-infections; however, there are no data on the estimated prevalence of each severity class. Surprisingly, there was no significant overall, or initial (dpi 0 to 5) reductions in ADG or ADFI due to PEDV infection in this study. In fact, ADFI was increased overall due to PEDV challenge compared with Control pigs, and this was most evident at dpi 6 to 20. These data are contrary to what has been previously reported, which PEDV reduced ADG and ADFI from dpi 0 to 7 by 46 to 78 and 23% to 28%, respectively, compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Schweer et al., 2015b; Curry et al., 2017a) . One possible explanation could be differences in PEDV infection severity. To evaluate why there was no statistical difference between the two treatments in regard to feed intake and to confirm that the feed intake of Control pigs was as expected, the Swine National Research Council modeling module (NRC, 2012) was utilized to predict feed intake based on dpi 0 BW of each treatment group and dietary energy. Given these parameters, the Control pigs where consuming feed close to their level of predicted during dpi 0 to 5 and PEDV pigs consumed approximately 27% less than their predicted. Although ADG and ADFI were not statistically different between treatments from dpi 0 to 5, these slight reductions in PEDV pigs ADG and ADFI compared with Control pigs resulted in reduced G:F. In this study, there was a 36% reduction in PEDV pigs feed efficiency from dpi 0 to 5 compared with Controls, which is similar to the 28% reduction in feed efficiency reported in 5 wk post-weaned pigs inoculated with PEDV compared with their na\u00efve counterparts from dpi 0 to 7 (Schweer et al., 2015b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 141, "text": "(Madson et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 221, "end": 240, "text": "(Kim and Lee, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 241, "end": 263, "text": "Schweer et al., 2015b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 264, "end": 284, "text": "Curry et al., 2017a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 370, "end": 385, "text": "(Johnson, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1067, "text": "(Schweer et al., 2015b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1088, "text": "Curry et al., 2017a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2175, "text": "(Schweer et al., 2015b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It was hypothesized that feed efficiency was reduced in PEDV pigs due to available nutrients in the lumen being utilized by the intestine during infection and recovery. Upon PEDV infection, enterocytes undergo apoptosis to rid the host of virus, which can result in reduced absorptive capacity of the small intestine (Curry et al., 2017b) . Previous work reported that PEDV detected by IHC is most abundant at dpi 5 and this coincides with increased crypt stem cell proliferation, DNA fragmentation, and active glutamine transport in the jejunum (Curry et al., 2017b) . In agreement with this study, it has been well characterized that during peak infection PEDV reduces VH (Stevenson et al., 2013; Madson et al., 2014) and that PEDV increases villus fusion as well as immune cell infiltrates (Schweer et al., 2015a) . Crypt stem cell proliferation has been assessed using Ki67 IHC, and PEDV-inoculated pigs have been shown to have increased Ki67-positive cells in small intestinal crypts Curry et al., 2017b) . Results from this study agree with Table 7 . Gluconeogenic enzymatic activity in liver and jejunum mucosal scrapings of na\u00efve (Control) and PEDV-inoculated pigs at dpi 5 and 20 1 these two earlier findings. The increased crypt stem cell proliferation was most likely due to rapid re-epithelialization of denuded villi observed in PEDV pigs at dpi 5, which would require increased glutamine transport as the main energy substrate for enterocytes (Burrin and Stoll, 2009 ), or as a precursor for synthesis of purines, glutathione, or acute phase proteins (Reeds et al., 1994) . The supply of energy and nutrients to the intestine is needed to regain absorptive capacity, but also needed by resident immune cells for proliferation and synthesis of effector molecules to rid the host of the pathogen (Humphrey and Klasing, 2004) . If energy and nutrients ingested and absorbed by the animal are not enough for immune cell proliferation and activation, then body tissue reserves such as amino acids and fatty acids may be required to provide those substrates. This in turn would likely exacerbate decreases in feed efficiency of livestock during pathogen challenge, which is reported herein. Enteric virus infections have been shown to increase intestinal epithelial protein translation machinery (Rhoads et al., 2007) . To further understand what was contributing to the reduction in G:F, it was tested to see if there was an increase in intestinal epithelial protein synthesis translation efficiency by assessing the proteinto-RNA ratio in PEDV and Control pig jejunal scrapings at dpi 5 and 20. Although there was no difference in this ratio between treatments within dpi, PEDV pigs tended to have greater protein-to-RNA ratio at dpi 20 compared with dpi 5. This may indicate that efficiency and machinery for protein synthesis were increased in PEDV pigs, but that increase may be after dpi 5. Active (phosphorylated) p70 S6K protein abundance was increased in jejunum of pigs inoculated with rotavirus compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Rhoads et al., 2007) . p70 S6K is protein involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is understood to be involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. In malnourished and rotavirus-infected pigs, (phosphorylated) p70 S6K protein abundance was also increased in the jejunum, but reduced in the muscle compared with na\u00efve counterparts (Rhoads et al., 2007) . Rotavirus, similar to PEDV, infects enterocytes and causes similar clinical signs of diarrhea and dehydration (Hagbom et al., 2011; Holloway and Coulson, 2013) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that the intestine has to rebuild an epithelial layer after PEDV infection in order to regain absorptive capacity. The rebuilding intestinal epithelial layer requires energy and nutrients for recovery and those may be coming from muscle, jejunum, liver, or combination of the three.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 338, "text": "(Curry et al., 2017b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 546, "end": 567, "text": "(Curry et al., 2017b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 674, "end": 698, "text": "(Stevenson et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 699, "end": 719, "text": "Madson et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 793, "end": 816, "text": "(Schweer et al., 2015a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1009, "text": "Curry et al., 2017b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1480, "text": "(Burrin and Stoll, 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1585, "text": "(Reeds et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1836, "text": "(Humphrey and Klasing, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2325, "text": "(Rhoads et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3047, "end": 3068, "text": "(Rhoads et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3409, "end": 3430, "text": "(Rhoads et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3543, "end": 3564, "text": "(Hagbom et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3565, "end": 3592, "text": "Holloway and Coulson, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1047, "end": 1054, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Feed efficiency may also be altered due to changes in postabsorptive metabolism and nutrient partitioning.

It was hypothesized that gluconeogenesis would provide glucose for ATP needed to combat infection and regeneration of the intestine and keto acids for metabolism. The liver is the main generator of endogenous glucose production (Mittelman and Bergman, 1998) ; however, the intestine is also gluconeogenic and may contribute to glucose production during various disease states.
