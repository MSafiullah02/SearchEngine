            "text": "Background-aim Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) can occur concomitantly and be associated with coagulopathy that influences TBI outcome. The use of bleeding time tests in TBI management is controversial. We hypothesized that in TBI patients with AUD, a prolonged bleeding time is associated with more severe injury and poor outcome. Material and methods Moderate and severe TBI patients with evidence of AUD were examined with bleeding time according to IVY bleeding time on admission during neurointensive care. Baseline clinical and radiological characteristics were recorded. A standardized IVY bleeding time test was determined by staff trained in the procedure. Bleeding time test results were divided into normal (\u2264 600 s), prolonged (> 600 s), and markedly prolonged (\u2265 900 s). Normal platelet count (PLT) was defined as > 150,000/ \u03bcL. This cohort was compared with another group of TBI patients without evidence of AUD. Results Fifty-two patients with TBI and AUD were identified, and 121 TBI patients without any history of AUD were used as controls. PLT was low in 44.2% and bleeding time was prolonged in 69.2% of patients. Bleeding time values negatively correlated with PLT (p < 0.05). TBI patients with markedly prolonged values (\u2265 900 s) had significantly increased hematoma size, and more frequently required intracranial pressure measurement and mechanical ventilation compared with those with bleeding times < 900 s (p < 0.05). Most patients (88%) with low platelet count had prolonged bleeding time. No difference in 6month outcome between the bleeding time groups was observed (p > 0.05). Subjects with TBI and no evidence for AUD had lower bleeding time values and higher platelet count compared with those with TBI and history of AUD (p < 0.05). Conclusions Although differences in the bleeding time values between TBI cohorts exist and prolonged values may be seen even in patients with normal platelet count, the bleeding test is a marker of primary hemostasis and platelet function with low specificity. However, it may provide an additional assessment in the interpretation of the overall status of TBI patients with AUD. Therefore, the bleeding time test should only be used in combination with the patient's bleeding history and careful assessment of other hematologic parameters.",

            "text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently associated with coagulation abnormalities which may negatively influence outcome [12, 27, 32, 43, 46, 51] . The underlying mechanisms leading to hemostatic problems following TBI are complex involving factors which can either separately or synergistically impair components of the coagulation system leading to platelet dysfunction and increased fibrinolysis [14, 23, 32, 42, 51, 57] . Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the detailed pathophysiology of coagulation pathway disturbance following TBI remains poorly understood [23, 57] . Alcohol consumption has by itself been shown to influence hemostasis [3, 30, 41] . In healthy individuals, platelet aggregation and bleeding time are impaired immediately following alcohol intake [8] , related to the amount of ingested alcohol [30] . Following TBI, acute and chronic alcohol use may predispose to hemorrhage by influencing coagulation and fibrinolytic systems which may in turn exacerbate outcome [21, 36] .",

In later decades, the cutaneous \"venostasis\" bleeding time technique was modified, standardized, and popularized by Ivy and others [2, 17, 18, 22] . The most common indications for the application of the IVY bleeding time test is the preoperative investigation of platelet function and primary hemostasis [4, 9, 13, 39] . Due to poor sensitivity and specificity and standardization problems of the IVY test, there is controversy regarding its efficacy to predict bleeding risk [4, 9, 24, 37] . However, it remains in use in many clinical practices including our neurosurgical department after the implementation of a carefully standardized testing protocol [28, 32, 38, 48] . It should also be noted that studies reporting controversial results regarding the IVY method did not include neurosurgical patient cohorts [4, 24, 37] .",

The exclusion criteria were the following: (1) multitrauma that may have influenced coagulation mechanisms (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 16), (2) marked preexisting or observed coagulation abnormalities such as international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.4 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 42 s and innate problems such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease, (3) patients on antiplatelet medication. Subjects with marked liver dysfunction reflected by prolonged hematologic parameters and liver function tests as well as bone marrow dysfunction were also not included in our study sample. The reference rates for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in our laboratory are 26-42 s. A control group with data from 121 patients from 2008 to 2012 including other TBI patients evaluated by the IVY test was also included and compared. Multitrauma cases with marked coagulation disturbances (such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease), those on antiplatelet medication, patients with preexisting significant coagulopathies, and patients with AUD were excluded.

CT scans were also screened during hospitalization to determine possible increase in hematoma size, midline shift, and ventricle size [31] . Changes in hematoma size (increase or decrease) during hospitalization were determined based on the radiology report and personal observations. Any increase in the midline shift was defined as the displacement of the septum pellucidum in relation to the midline in millimeters [19] .

Next, a sterile blood lancet performs a shallow intradermal incision over the bend of the supinated forearm. Every 30 s, a filter paper is used to gently absorb the blood and check for hemostasis. The time period from skin incision until the bleeding has stopped is measured.

However, its relevance has been repeatedly questioned in recent years. Numerous reports have stated that this test does not reflect hemostasis in other areas, it is poorly reproducible, and there are difficulties in standardization; it may be normal in patients with known bleeding tendency as well as in patients on antiplatelet medication, or abnormal in individuals with a negative history of coagulation problems [13, 20, 24, 52] . Moreover, it can be time consuming for the staff conducting the test. It has also been stated that even normal bleeding time values cannot reliably exclude patients prone to bleeding in surgery, emphasizing the importance of a careful and detailed bleeding history [5, 24, 37] . Nevertheless, mainly due to its simplicity and natural results, there are centers still using the bleeding test as a screening tool in patients prone to bleeding either preoperatively or during hospitalization, especially when more specialized tests are unavailable, expensive, or time consuming. Moreover, there is paucity of data on the use of the bleeding test in neurosurgical patients.",

More patients with prolonged bleeding time had an increase in hematoma size and in the midline shift as evidenced on repeat CT scans. It remains unknown whether this increase resulted from prolonged bleeding time values or from the natural course and progression of intracranial hematoma [35] . No difference in the number of patients that required decompressive surgery or reoperation was seen, and outcome at discharge did not differ between the two groups. It should be noted that in patients with coagulation problems including prolonged bleeding time, special effort was made to correct them as soon as possible. Therefore, it may be concluded that moderately prolonged values do not significantly impact the outcome in chronic alcohol abusers from the surgical and clinical TBI perspective, given the condition that prolonged values are normalized shortly following their detection. In individuals with markedly prolonged bleeding time values (\u2265 900 s, 40.3%), the impact on injury severity was more evident. In addition to an increase in hematoma size, more patients required ICP monitoring and mechanical ventilation. Regarding ICP monitoring in patients with severe coagulation problems, insertion of ICP catheter is postponed until the coagulation status is sufficiently improved. However, in the current cohort, this was only partially true since only 28.6% of patients with bleeding time > 900 s received ICP monitoring later than 24 h from injury. When the two groups were compared, no difference either in the need for decompressive surgery or reoperation was noted. More patients with thrombocytopenia were included in the > 900s bleeding time group, but this difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, it can be postulated that bleeding time may, to some extent, behave differently compared with platelet count. It should be noted though that no difference in the 6-month outcome was seen between the groups.",

It should be noted that in patients with thrombocytopenia compared with those with normal platelet count, the 6-month outcome was similar. In TBI, the platelet count below 100,000/\u03bcL is associated with increased mortality and is a commonly used cutoff in neurosurgery [25] . However, the present study investigated the possible added value of IVY in those patients where coagulation disorders were not obvious and chose the reference value of 150,000/\u03bcL as our cutoff based on the existing laboratory reference from the literature [10, 11] . Noticeably, only one patient had platelet count below 50,000/ \u03bcL and in total, 11/52 had platelet count below 100,000/\u03bcL, representing thus a minor percentage of our study cohort and an insufficient number to compare with.",

Therefore, correlation of the bleeding time with other coagulation parameters including platelet count is of importance since they both may reflect hemostasis. Nekludov et al. studied four patient groups (severe isolated TBI, general trauma without TBI, chronic alcohol abusers, and healthy volunteers). It was found that bleeding time in TBI patients was significantly prolonged compared with that in the other groups. In the same study, platelet count was similar in TBI patients and alcoholics [32] . Diagnosis and treatment of platelet dysfunction using platelet transfusion, platelet-stimulating drugs, or no treatment remain controversial in TBI. According to the current findings, AUD subjects had more prolonged values compared with those with no history of AUD. Moreover, the current results highlight possible difficulties in determining platelet function since an association between bleeding time and increased hematoma size was noted.",

The current study mainly investigated the potential added value of IVY bleeding time test when other coagulation abnormalities were in the normal range. Pathological INR and aPTT values would confuse the present findings and therefore, the conclusions on the value of the IVY bleeding time test. Moreover, these more specialized coagulation tests may provide more accurate data but also have their limitations (financial costs, sometimes time consuming, are not available in all hospitals); frequently, they cannot be done on a nonregular basis (during the night, weekends, etc.), and their interpretation requires special knowledge and training in the field compared with the easy interpreted results of bleeding time [26, 56] . Moreover, when compared with the common diagnostic tools (INR, PT, aPTT), fibrinolysis methods can be sometimes more cumbersome and less standardized [56] . Lastly, it can be postulated that alcohol may influence viscoelastic method parameters, possibly acting on platelets and especially in trauma patients [16] .",

However, in the present study, this correlation was weak, since 46% of patients with prolonged bleeding time had platelet counts above 150,000/\u03bcL and 26% with normal bleeding time had low platelet counts. Following brain trauma, the bleeding time and other platelet functional tests may be prolonged, permanently or temporary, for some time secondary to the injury and irrespective of a normal platelet count. Whether this is due to a direct \"platelet shock\" by the brain trauma or secondary to other coagulation pathology, it remains debated. The different prevalence of a long bleeding time between the control and the AUD group can be related to multiple factors such as alcohol misuse, trauma severity, initial taking care, or medication, although this is difficult to state and is something which remains to be validated. The present findings can stimulate further studies to investigate whether dysfunctional platelets are of direct importance and not just an association with the outcome in TBI patients and if platelet transfusion can have a different effect (either positive or negative) on congenital platelet dysfunction or drug-induced platelet inhibition than in TBI.",

When a patient presents with a clearly elevated INR at 1.5 or higher, the IVY test would not routinely be employed in our department, in view of other important measures used to correct such coagulopathy (such as prothrombin complex concentrates). Regarding INR and TBI, although we acknowledge the fact that many recommend values > 1.2 as a limit for warfarin reversal, others suggest a target value of INR < 1.5 in cases with a positive CT scan [54] . Moreover, in surgical candidates, as TBI patients frequently are, an INR value of 1.5 or lower is commonly considered a limit where surgery can proceed safely [50, 54] . Of note, in the current study, no patient had an INR \u2265 1.5, only two had an INR of 1.4, and two had an INR of 1.3 on initial testing, representing thus a small percentage of the total cohort.",

Information on the history of AUD was extracted from the patient archives and ICD codes, and no strict criteria or dedicated questionnaires could be applied mainly because of their critical condition. There was no available information on blood ethanol levels at the time of injury. Detailed clinical data and management data were in some occasions incomplete. Specialized coagulation tests to confirm or rule out bleeding tendency and tests to evaluate platelet function were typically not carried out. Since IVY has been used in a standardized way for a long time and performed by well-trained and experienced personnel in our unit with minor problems, we believe the commonly described variability of the IVY method in our unit is very limited. The exact time frame from injury to subjection to the IVY bleeding time test was not available for every individual. However, since the bleeding time test was available 24/7, it was typically performed not later than 8-12 h from injury. Due to small patient sample, multivariate analysis was not done. Further detailed data on the control group was not available. Lastly, clinical outcome at 6 months was available for 82.7% of patients.",

However, the bleeding time test may provide an additional assessment in the interpretation of the overall status of the TBI patients with AUD.
