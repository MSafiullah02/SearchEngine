Many viruses also encode their own enzymes for RNA capping. The mRNA capping process consists of four sequential reactions: (1) an RNA triphosphatase hydrolyzes the 5\u2032 triphosphate of a nascent mRNA to a diphosphate; (2) a guanylyltransferase (GTase) adds a GMP molecule to the RNA 5\u2032 diphosphate to form GpppRNA; (3) a 7-N-methyltransferase (7-N-MTase) transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to the GpppRNA to form m7GpppRNA and generates S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH); and (4) a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) transfers a methyl group from SAM to the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the first nucleotide ribose of the RNA and generates SAH [1].",

Most dsRNA viruses have a multilayer spherical capsid. The outer capsid layers of dsRNA viruses present greatest diversity in both sequences and structural organization to adapt to different cell membrane barriers. A common process adopted by many dsRNA viruses is the uncoating of the outer capsid after delivery into the cytoplasm of the host cell, where the inner capsid particles (ICPs) remain intact. In order to protect the viral transcription process from the antiviral defense mechanisms of the host cells, the ICPs contain virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and capping enzymes and serve as a stable nano-scale machine for viral mRNA transcription and capping [2].",

Cypovirus is unique among viruses of the Reoviridae family in that it possesses a single capsid layer. The cypovirus capsid contains transcriptional and capping enzymes, as identified in the ICPs of other multilayer turreted viruses in the Reoviridae family [3]. Previously, we reported the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a transcribing cypovirus at ~ 4.1 \u00c5 resolution and a non-transcribing cypovirus at ~ 3.9 \u00c5 resolution [3], [4]. The turret of cypovirus at each fivefold vertex is formed by five monomers of turret protein VP3, which contains three separate enzymatic domains that catalyze the last three of the four sequential reactions in RNA capping [5]: mRNA GTase, 7-N-MTase, and 2\u2032-O-MTase. In addition to these three enzymatic domains, VP3 contains two other domains: a bridge domain, which bridges the GTase and the two methyltransferases (MTases) according to the domain nomenclature of orthoreovirus turret protein [5], and a brace domain, which serves to brace a spike-like complex at the fivefold vertex in the pentameric turret [3]. The three enzymatic domains of VP3 are topologically identical with those in orthoreovirus [5] and aquareovirus [6], [7]. A GMP moiety, which defines the active site of a GTase domain, was observed in transcribing cypovirus VP3 [4]. However, due to the structural resolution limit of transcribing cypovirus VP3, the active sites of the two RNA MTases, which are defined by positions of SAM/SAH and RNA, were not resolved. How the two RNA MTase activities are facilitated by the turret protein is still unknown.",

The density maps of turret proteins are of sufficient quality that we can identify nearly all the main chains and approximately 80% of the side chains, permitting us to build an atomic model.

            "text": "The structure of the first MTase (MTase-1) domain (residues 419\u2013461 and 526\u2013725) of cypovirus VP3 remains largely unchanged compared to its counterpart in the non-transcribing cypovirus. However, an additional density feature, which is absent in non-transcribing cypovirus, was observed in the MTase-1 domain of transcribing cypovirus VP3 (Fig. 1d). This additional density cannot be assigned to any main chain or side chain; therefore, we attribute it to either a SAM or a SAH molecule located in the MTase-1 site. However, at the ~ 3.8 \u00c5 resolution, it is not possible to discriminate between the SAM and SAH molecules. A conserved catalytic tetrad KDKE (Lys531, Asp616, Lys649, and Glu689), which is thought to be a characteristic of RNA 2\u2032-O-MTases [1], [14], was observed in the MTase-1 site, suggesting that the MTase-1 is 2\u2032-O-MTase (Fig. 2a). An aromatic Tyr620 was observed to interact with the SAM/SAH molecule (Fig. S2), which is thought to be essential for cap methylation [15]. The cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase domain is almost topologically identical with other viral 2\u2032-O-MTases for which structures are known, such as the bluetongue virus 2\u2032-O-MTase domain in VP4 [12], the vaccinia virus VP39 [9], and the coronavirus nsp16 [11]. Moreover, when these 2\u2032-O-MTases are structurally aligned, the side chains of the KDKE tetrad in the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase domain closely overlap (Fig. S3a) with those of bluetongue virus 2\u2032-O-MTase domain, vaccinia virus VP39 [9], and coronavirus nsp16 [11]. All side chains of the KDKE tetrad point toward a cleft, which is the putative RNA binding site in the 2\u2032-O-MTase domain (Fig. 2a). According to the crystal structure of vaccinia virus VP39 complexed with a SAH and a 7-N-methylated single-stranded RNA hexamer [16], the Lys531, Lys649, and Glu689 of the conserved tetrad in cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase serve to interact with the RNA sugar-phosphate backbone, and Asp616 plays a key role in SAM/SAH binding. In addition to the conserved tetrad, residues Gly562, Asp589, and Val600 around the SAM/SAH structure in the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase are also conserved and overlap closely with those in the bluetongue virus 2\u2032-O-MTase domain of VP4, vaccinia virus VP39, and coronavirus nsp16. In addition, the SAM/SAH structure of cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase overlaps closely with those in bluetongue virus 2\u2032-O-MTase domain in VP4, vaccinia virus VP39, or coronavirus nsp16 (Fig. S3b). Side chains around SAM/SAH in these 2\u2032-O-MTases are also similar (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that these 2\u2032-O-MTases are functionally conserved.",

We also observed an additional density feature in the 7-N-MTase domain, which is similar to the SAM/SAH density in the 2\u2032-O-MTase domain of transcribing cypovirus VP3 (Fig. 1e).

Consistent with this, superimposition between the cypovirus 7-N-MTase, Ecm1, and vaccinia virus D1 shows that the SAM/SAH structures in these 7-N-MTases closely overlap. The residues Gly863, Asp868, and Asp882 that interact with the SAM/SAH in the cypovirus 7-N-MTase are conserved and closely overlapped in Ecm1 and vaccinia virus D1. In the cypovirus 7-N-MTase, the adenosine of SAM/SAH is stacked between Phe906 and Pro883, which closely overlap with Tyr124 and Ile95, respectively, in Ecm1 (Fig. 2c). In vaccinia virus D1, the adenosine moiety is stacked between Tyr683 and Arg548. Indeed, mutagenesis experiments have shown that the aromatic nature of the residue is essential for the stacking of SAM adenine rather than the hydroxyl group in tyrosine [15].",

            "text": "In many viruses, the RNA capping reactions are sequential events. In order to reach the active sites of the enzymes efficiently and in proper order, the nascent RNA needs to follow a fixed pathway inside the turret. A previous study of a mammalian orthoreovirus suggested that RNA triphosphatase interacts with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [19] and therefore is located on the inner surface of the inner capsid adjacent to the fivefold axis [20]. This observation suggests that the first capping reaction (hydrolyzing of 5\u2032 triphosphate) occurs in the reovirus inner capsid before nascent RNA reaches the turret chamber through a peripentonal channel [4] in the capsid shell. Previously, we observed a rod-like density feature in the peripentonal channel in the 4.1-\u00c5-resolution density map of the transcribing cypovirus, which was attributed to a partially resolved RNA [4]. A similar density feature was also observed at nearly the same location of the peripentonal channel in the new 3.8-\u00c5-resolution density map (Fig. S4). In the turret chamber, transfer of GMP to the 5\u2032 diphosphate RNA is followed by N7-guanine and 2\u2032-O methylation [21], [22]. The first enzymatic domain that the nascent RNA reaches is the GTase domain in the turret [4], [20]. The density of the GMP moiety, which is present in the GTase domain in the 4.1-\u00c5-resolution density map [4], is also visible in the GTase domain in the new 3.8-\u00c5-resolution density map (Fig. S5). The GTase domain of one VP3 monomer (e.g., monomer C in Fig. 3a and Movie S1) and the active site of a 7-N-MTase domain of another monomer (monomer A in Fig. 3a and Movie S1) are connected via a channel (denoted as channel-1), which is formed by a bridge domain and a brace domain of monomer A (Fig. 3a and Movie S1) and a brace domain of another monomer (monomer B in Fig. 3a and Movie S1) [3]. Structural analysis of transcribing cypovirus indicates that this channel-1 is approximately 20% wider in the transcribing than that in the non-transcribing cypovirus [4]. We therefore propose that channel-1 guides the RNA molecule, namely, from the GTase domain of monomer C to the active site of the 7-N-MTase of monomer A. In support of this proposal, some fragmented density features approaching the SAM/SAH in 7-N-MTase were observed inside channel-1 (indicated in magenta in Fig. 3a and b). The fragmented density features (indicated in magenta in Fig. S6) have higher density level than noise. Because these density features do not belong to any main chain or side chain of VP3 and were not observed in non-transcribing cypovirus, we assigned them to a part of an RNA molecule present in the channel. The RNA was not resolved, as well as the VP3 structure, because only one RNA molecule is present in the pentameric turret at a time [20] and also due to the fact that the RNA is moving and flexible in the channel during the processes of RNA transcription and capping.",

Similar to those RNA structures approaching the 7-N-MTase domain, some fragmented density features were also observed in a channel (denoted as channel-2 in Fig. 3a), which is formed by the bridge domain of monomer A, the GTase domain and the 2\u2032-O-MTase domain of monomer B, and which leads to the SAM/SAH molecule and the putative RNA binding cleft of the 2\u2032-O-MTase domain (Fig. 3a\u2013d and Movie S1). We assigned these fragmented density features to RNA as well. The observation of the RNA structures leads us to suggest that the RNA withdraws from the 7-N-MTase domain of one copy of VP3 (monomer A) through channel-1 and approaches the active site of the adjacent 2\u2032-O-MTase domain of another copy of VP3 (monomer B) through channel-2 in the turret (Fig. 3a and b; Fig. S6 and S7 and Movie S1). The process is reminiscent of the two methylations in a flavivirus, for which it was shown that the RNA dissociates from the MTase molecule after N7-guanine methylation and reassociates with another MTase molecule for 2\u2032-O methylation [10].",

As described above, the VP39 and cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase share a very similar topology, and some key residues interacting with SAM/SAH and RNA are conserved (Fig. 2b). In addition, their SAM/SAH binding sites are superimposed when the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase and the VP39 complex are structurally aligned. These results suggest that the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase binds RNA in a similar manner to VP39. Based on the vaccinia virus VP39 complex structure, we built a model of RNA binding into the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase by superimposing the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase on the VP39 complex. Without any manual position adjustment, the VP39 RNA fitted well into the putative RNA binding cleft in the cypovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase (Fig. 4a and b). Indeed, all these RNA structures approaching the active site of the 2\u2032-O-MTase domain are distributed along the strand of the RNA model built based on the structure of the VP39 complex (Fig. 4b).",
