Recently, it was mentioned that 20.4% of COVID-19 patients in Italy develop cutaneous manifestation of erythematous rash, widespread urticaria, and chickenpoxlike vesicles with the trunk as the main involved region. 5 Cardiovascular disease is among the most common comorbidity found in COVID-19 patients. This study will highlight a self-reported case of exanthema manifestation which manifested in the extremities of a medical personnel serving at the isolation room of a National Cardiovascular Center, who suffered from COVID-19. The goal is to describe in detail the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients, especially the cutaneous manifestation that was just recently known to present in COVID-19 infection along with its appearance after the treatment.",

Azithromycin was known to cause fixed drug eruption and erythema multiforme. However, target lesions that were pathognomonic for erythema multiforme were not present and despite continued use of azithromycin from day two to day 11 of symptoms, the skin lesion Page 8 of 13 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 toned down and resolved by itself from day seven of symptom, proving the skin eruptions to be caused by viral exanthema. 7, 8 Aside from due to drug eruption, viral exanthem distributed in the extremities area was at first thought to be the manifestation of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). The manifestation of stomatitis aphthous also supported the diagnosis of HFMD. 9 However, there are several characteristics of HFMD which did not fit to our patient: first, the most prevalent age-group of HFMD was among the patients below five years of age; second, the mucosal lesions usually erupt in the first two days; third, lesions in buttocks and genitalia are usually notifiable. 10, 11 Moreover, the PCR nasooropharyngeal swab examination also clearly stated the presence of COVID-19 infection in our patient and no previous contact to HFMD patient was noted.",
