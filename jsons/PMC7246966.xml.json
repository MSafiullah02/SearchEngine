In the world of sleep medicine, there has been significant progress made in non-invasive ventilator technology. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines were seen as ventilator alternatives. In the setting of a highly contagious pandemic, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 by aerosol was more than a hypothesis. In a Washington State nursing home, CPAP therapy was suspected to have caused the spread of COVID-19 in the residents. The American Society of Anesthesiologists issued guidance discouraging CPAP use in COVID-19 patients.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergently approved for the modification of respiratory devices to prevent aerosolization. A plastic bell-like helmet with a rubber collar seal is proposed to replace high leak risk face mask [2]. Besides, with fewer features, CPAP machines can be mass manufactured in large quantities than hospital ventilators.",

According to a new study published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene [3], by less use of ventilators, the death rate could be reduced by more than 50%. It is important to realize that ventilator-associated acute lung injury is well known and may occur with overinflation in a lung with near-normal compliance. A group of European physicians detailed COVID-19\u2019s discrepancies from typical ARDS [4]. New York City case series indicated that at least 88% of coronavirus patients died while on the ventilator [5].",

This is further confounded by increased time watching television and listening to negative news. Also, health, job, personal finance, and economy-related worries, and near-future uncertainty darken the situation. Isolation and depression are worse in these times of social distancing, quarantines, and work from home conditions. The consumption of tea, coffee, and alcohol has remarkably increased per recent data that interrupts good quality sleep. Chronic partial sleep deprivation may negatively affect the innate immune system more than the adaptive immune system. Long-term sleep deprivation causes more damage. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity for a few to align their circadian clock by following a regular sleep schedule when social activity and outdoor time are minimal.",

Prevalence of shift-work, high workload, long hours, sleep interruptions, and insufficient sleep lead to widespread burnout. Physician wellbeing must include appropriate rest breaks, designated nap areas, continued counseling, and educational reminders regarding sleep hygiene practices. Better sleep quality and quantity may positively impact functioning at high levels.",
