Current algorithms include clinical signs and symptoms providing evidence for COVID-19 infection. A recently published case series of 214 hospitalized coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, identified more than a third of patients had non-specific symptoms including headache, dizziness, anorexia and diarrhea, and neurological symptoms such as loss of taste, hearing, and vision; confusion or a decreased level of consciousness; or a new seizure or cerebrovascular accident (3).

(4) . When treating ALS patients in the home environment, the potential for generating infectious aerosols should be a primary concern. Viral particles from an ALS patient may be dispersed when using airway clearance devices during respiratory treatment, nebulization, suctioning, and use of cough assist. When using non-invasive ventilation, the spread of viral particles occurs due to wearing vented masks or poorly fitting full-face masks. Particles are also spread through CO2 exhalation ports (1) . For the advanced ALS patient dependent on a home non-invasive ventilator, equipment modifications may reduce virus transmission and the infection of caregivers.",

This conversion is performed in three steps and is overseen by the ALS Neurologist or the ALS Pulmonologist. First, a respiratory therapist must set-up a new ventilator or revise an existing one. Second, the respiratory therapist titrates equipment settings to the patient's comfort. Finally, the respiratory therapist instructs the patient and family in the use of the new or modified equipment, including providing instruction in sterile precautions. Please note that these modifications during a pandemic, when medical resources become low, may not be easily feasible due to a lack of personnel or medical and protective equipment. Ventilator equipment adapters may be in short supply. Furthermore, patients that do not tolerate a non-vented mask will require sealing the vent ports on their existing mask. Caution must be taken when modifying/sealing existing vented masks as they contain an anti-asphyxia valve that MUST be removed or disabled or risk asphyxia in the event of a machine malfunction. A further limit to feasibility may occur when patients or the patient's family may bar medical personnel from the home out of concern for increasing their risk of exposure to infection.",
