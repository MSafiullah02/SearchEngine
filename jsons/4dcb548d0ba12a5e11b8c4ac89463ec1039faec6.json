The vulnerability that we are experiencing during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was eloquently described by Camus while the plague devastated the Algerian town. Similarly, the current COVID-19 pandemic -the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into human populations in the 21 st Century-has caused an incalculable human toll in many settings and it has disrupted the global economy. Approximately, 185 countries have reported cases, with more than 1,876,000 confirmed cases and 116,000 deaths worldwide. In the midst of this pandemic, the commitment, empathy, and human spirit of every single healthcare provider is a major source of inspiration and pride. The author has no conflicts to disclose.",

            "text": "Over the last few weeks, roaming through the intensive care units reveals recurrent and monotonous scenes of sorrow and confusion recalls the images printed in medical school textbooks of lines after lines of iron lungs for paralyzed children during poliomyelitis epidemics in the 1950s. Except, now, only adults are part of this large collective wreckage in human history. The relentless determination and compassion of nurses, intensivists, respiratory therapists and other healthcare workers is only countered by the loneliness of patients without their loved ones at their side.Pandemics represent the most dramatic presentation of the rapid and effective spread of infectious pathogens such as bacteria or a virus acting as the wildcards of world's history. The cost in human lives is only rivaled to the resulting social breakdown, disruption of business, and widespread panic. Camus' narrative reveals our contemporaneous familiarity with the concept of how our lives and our sorrows become instantly meaningless when an epidemic that spreads unexpectedly, inconveniently interrupting our daily routines. But more than anything, Camus' reminds us that we can never be mentally or fully prepared for pandemics. The gifts of the enlightment and the advances of civilization results pointless when a pandemic removes the safety bumpers of our lives. Suffering becomes randomly distributed causing everyone to aspire escaping the fates of an unfortunate destiny.In Camus' tale, which is by many considered the best European novel of the postwar period, the narrator, Dr. Bernard Rieux works tirelessly to reduce the suffering of the inhabitants of Oran.In one the passages, Dr. Rieux states, \"the whole thing is not about heroism\u2026.It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency\". For Dr. Rieux, decency meant doing his job in relieving human suffering during the health crisis and the pilling number of dead bodies caused by the relentless Black Death. Albert Camus' story reminds us the enormous respect and admiration of the human spirit when a plague such as the one currently befalling on us. There are many modern versions of Dr. Rieux's and whom have cared with the utmost professionalism and decency for those severely afflicted by this modern plague.",
