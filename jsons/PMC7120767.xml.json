            "text": "Following the first description of astroviruses in human stool in 1975 [1, 27], astrovirus-like particles were described and reported in domesticated animals. The first reports derived from infections in mammals such as lambs and calves suffering from diarrhea [40, 48]. Indeed, between the end of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s several animal species were found positive for astrovirus and many novel animal astroviruses were described probably as a consequence of the description of the discovery of astrovirus infection in humans few years before. Over the next 20 years, there was a hiatus of information about the occurrence of novel astroviruses or the clinical manifestations associated with known astroviruses in mammalian species. The lack of a clear association of astrovirus detection in clinical specimens with signs of disease in animals, together with the limited sensitivity and availability of laboratory tests (i.e., electron microscopy and virus isolation) contributed to this gap in information. The advent of the genomic and metagenomic era in the recent period appears to have revitalized investigations in this field and there is now new interest in the circulation of astroviruses in animal and human populations, with an increasing number of reports concerning new host species infected and novel astroviruses described in the last ten years.",

            "text": "Ovine astrovirus (OAstV) replicates in the absorptive epithelial cells of the small intestine and induces mild diarrhea in gnotobiotic lambs [13, 41]. The genome of OastV isolated in 1977 has been completely sequenced in more recent years [22], although information on its capsid protein sequence were published a few years before [21]. Results from these papers indicated that human, feline, and porcine astroviruses were most closely related to each other than to OAstV. However, as with most of the known astroviruses, OAstV harbors a RNA motif in the 3\u2032-end of the genome common to distinct and genetically different virus families (i.e., Coronaviruses and Picornaviruses) and is supposed to derive from a recombination event between these viruses [20]. Genetic sequencing of astroviruses recently led to the detection of viruses in human stool that are genetically closely related to OAstV and mink astrovirus (MiAstV), and has revealed the possibility that these viruses have a common ancestor, as previously suggested also for the HAstVs, feline astroviruses (FAstVs), and porcine astroviruses (PAstVs) [11, 20, 23, 35]. Despite the detailed genetic studies undertaken on the genome of this virus, no further clinical or epidemiological reports indicating its occurrence and circulation in animals have appeared in the last 35 years. As a consequence, the epidemiology as well as the genetic and antigenic diversity of OAstV is poorly defined and only the complete genome sequence of the original isolate is available in the public genetic database (GenBank, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).",

            "text": "One year after the detection of astrovirus in lambs, the first isolate of bovine astrovirus (BAstV) was reported in England [48]. Astrovirus was considered to be avirulent as experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves remained clinically normal, although pathological studies on infected calves were not performed at that time. In Florida in1984, a bovine enteric virus antigenically related to the UK strain of BAstV was shown to cause infection and cytopathology of the M cells of the dome epithelium covering Peyer\u2019s patches of the ileum of gnotobiotic calves. Similar to the England strain, these animals remained clinically normal during the course of the infection and only a change in the color of the feces from brown to yellow was noticed [49]. In 1985, a further isolate of BAstV was obtained from a colostrum-deprived calf which developed diarrhea [50]. Serotyping of the strains from England and USA based on neutralization and immunofluorescence assays indicated that these viruses were antigenically related although likely belonging to different serotypes. The antigenic diversity detected in the earlier studies is also reflected in the more recently described genetic diversity for BAstV. Tse et al. [44] detected sequences from two different BAstVs coinfecting 2 out of 5 positive specimens [44]. The phylogenetic analyses support classification of BAstVs and the newly discovered astroviruses in roe deer (CCAstV) under the proposed \u201cgenocluster GI\u201d of the Mamastrovirus [4, 38, 44].",

            "text": "Originally, a serologic study conducted on cattle in the United States led to the detection of a 30% seropositivity for astrovirus [49] but the limited clinical significance initially attributed to BAstV infection in cattle probably explains why there has been a lack of further reports for more than 25 years, until 2011 [44]. Although a previous study suggested that BAstV could be excreted by 60\u2013100% of calves on farms [5], a much lower rate of isolation (2.6%) was found by analyzing 1,060 field samples of diarrhea in calves aged from 3 days to 3 weeks of age [50]. A very similar detection rate (2.4%) was revealed by analyzing 209 rectal swabs collected from asymptomatic adult cattle by RT-PCR [44]. It was originally concluded that in natural conditions, BAstV did not seem to be directly associated with a severe diarrheic disease in calves [5, 44, 48, 49] and few controversial data are available on the prevalence of this infection. For this reason, it has recently been recommended that a large-scale surveillance study for BAstV should be performed in commercially farmed cattle to re-evaluate the circulation and the epidemiology of this virus.",

Attempts to propagate the viruses by serial passages on bovine embryonic kidney cells failed but seroconversion was detected in convalescent sera collected 2 weeks after virus shedding. Following this report, no more cases of astrovirus infections in red deer have been published and the role of these viruses in the enteric outbreak described in the UK remains uncertain. However, an outbreak of enteric disease recently occurred in a dense wild population of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Denmark at the beginning of 2010. Virological investigations led to the identification and characterization of novel astroviruses (CcAstV) in the absence of evidence of other viral, bacterial, or parasitic pathogens [38]. In the original study, two CcAstV detected in two distinct samples revealed a relatively low amino acid sequence identity (84.9%) in the region encoded by the RdRP gene. As the genetic distance between the two CcAstV is at least as large as that between the eight human astrovirus serotypes, the authors concluded that these novel astroviruses may constitute two different serotypes [38]. The viruses responsible for the infection was shown to genetically belong to the genus Mamastrovirus and are related to BAstV, suggesting that this virus could cross the species barrier to infect both cattle and roe deer [38, 44].",

            "text": "After the first clinical report in 1981, astrovirus-like particles have been described in the feces of domestic cats in Australia, England, Germany, New Zealand, and the USA [15, 17, 18, 29, 36]. The first report originating from the USA described the occurrence of severe and prolonged enteric signs with green and watery diarrhea for about 2 weeks, poor body condition and dehydration in a female 4-month-old kitten [18]. Typical astrovirus-like particles were detected in feces by electron microscopy but virus isolation attempts in primary feline kidney cells and fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line failed. A few years later, a naturally acquired astrovirus infection was described in a 1-year-old domestic cat in England that was presented to the veterinary clinic with a history of intermittent vomiting and diarrhea [15]. No parasites or significant bacterial pathogens were detected in the feces but the presence of a large number of astrovirus-like particles was documented. Fecal filtrates containing astrovirus-like particles were administered to 14-week-old specific pathogen-free kittens causing two episodes of pyrexia and mild diarrhea [15]. Inoculated SPF kittens had intermittent excretion of virus between day 4 and day 6 postinfection. Viruses from feces of SPF kittens were isolated on feline embryo cells incubated in the presence of 10\u201350 \u03bcg of trypsin. Under experimental conditions, events of pyrexia coincided with episodes of virus shedding and seroconversion was observed in the experimentally infected animals by immunofluorescence assay. No cross reactivity between feline and human astroviruses was observed by immune electron microscopy [15]. Based on the report from England, astrovirus-like infection in kittens appeared to be associated to clinical disease. However in a 16-month study conducted in Australia, the occurrence of this viral infection was not related to the age of cats and to the presence of diarrhea [29]. Interestingly, in this study, a human serum was found to react against a cat astrovirus by immune electron microscopy, implying similarity in antigenic regions between human and FeAstV [29]. A later report from New Zealand described the presence of an astrovirus-like particle in the diarrheic feces of two young kittens [36]. Since 1993, no further reports of astrovirus infections in cats have been reported and the role of these viruses in feline enteritis and their epidemiology remains obscure. Furthermore, to date, only partial sequences of the ORF1b and of the ORF2 of these viruses have been deposited in public databases and feline astrovirus diversity has not yet been explored. Interestingly, a study on both astrovirus genome sequences and host species evolution has led to the hypothesis of a likely cross-species transmission from pigs to cats and further from cats to humans, possibly involving intermediate species [25].",

However, these reports were based on electron microscopy descriptions only, thus the correct and complete identification of the small virus particles detected was not possible. The occurrence of astrovirus infection in dogs was only recently confirmed by RT-PCR detection and further genetic characterization by sequencing [43, 53]. In 2011, a canine astrovirus (CaAstV) has also been successfully isolated in cell culture for the first time [30]. To date, CaAstV or astrovirus-like particles in dogs have been reported in the USA, Germany, Austria, Italy, China, and France, suggesting the worldwide circulation of these viruses [14, 28, 43, 46, 47, 53]. The clinical significance of CaAstV infections in dogs requires further investigation; however, CaAstV was detected from symptomatic puppies occasionally suffering from diarrhea in association with other enteric viruses, such as rotaviruses [43] and corona- and/or parvo-like viruses [30, 47]. The clinical sign most commonly associated with the presence of astrovirus in puppies is a self-limiting watery diarrhea. However, based on RT-PCR virus shedding can persist long after the termination of the clinical signs [30]. A recent study on the prevalence of CaAstV in Shanghai, China, suggested that 12% (22/183) of the puppies showing clinical signs of diarrhea were positive for astrovirus by RT-PCR as compared to none of the 138 healthy controls [53]. In a recent study conducted in Italy, 24.5% of 110 stool samples collected from symptomatic dogs and 9.3% of 75 from asymptomatic animals surveyed tested positive for the presence of CaAstV RNA [30]. In the same study, serologic assay indicated that 59% of 54 dogs aged >3 months surveyed in Italy presented specific CaAstV antibodies [30]. A similar prevalence based on viral RNA detection was found in France where 20.9% (66/316) of the puppies in 42% (14/33) in breeding kennels surveyed were CaAstV-positive by RT-PCR [14]. In the same report, the authors noted that puppies less than 7 week-old were especially susceptible to CaAstV infection [14]. These data indicate that CaAstV is ubiquitous in the canine populations in several parts of the world.",

Among available sequences, the closest similarity was found with HAstV-7 and HAstV-1 (22% and 59.4% nucleotide similarity for ORF2 and partial ORF1b sequences, respectively). Thus, genospecies GI.E has been further proposed as being a new species [4].

            "text": "A preweaning syndrome has been well described in mink farms in Denmark since 1954 [42]. This syndrome usually affects minks 1\u20134 weeks of age and mink farmers refer to it as \u201csticky,\u201d \u201cgreasy,\u201d or \u201cwet\u201d kits, due to the hypersecretion from apocrine glands in the dorsal neck region resulting in soiling of the neck and back [39], together with diarrhea and dehydration at various degrees [16]. The postmortem lesions described in kits dying from this syndrome are catarrhal enteritis with villous atrophy and desquamation of epithelial cells at the tip of intestinal villi [16, 19]. Many causative factors have been associated with the occurrence of this syndrome, including diet, bacterial, and viral pathogens [10]. In 2002, astrovirus infection was epidemiologically linked to the preweaning syndrome in minks, although its definitive etiology remained obscure [10]. In 2003, the astrovirus associated with this syndrome was entirely sequenced and characterized as a novel astrovirus with less than 67% similarity at the nucleotide level with the closest related OAstV, thus called MiAstV [32, 33]. Interestingly, sequence analysis of MiAstVs from geographically distinct Swedish and Danish farms indicated that they were conserved genetically, although this observation was mainly based on a short fragment of the ORF1b and geographical clusters were revealed [32, 33]. This appears to be in contrast with the data collected for astroviruses infecting other species, such as swine, bats or turkeys, indicating a high degree of genetic variability [6, 26, 34, 52]. More recently, a novel astrovirus has been discovered in brain tissue of mink developing the so-called shaking mink syndrome (SMS), a transmissible neurological syndrome described for the first time in farmed minks of Denmark, followed by detection in both Sweden and Finland. The main clinical signs are shaking, staggering gait, and ataxia, with no evident gross lesions present postmortem. Nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis is a common lesion revealed by histopathology [3, 12]. Blomstrom et al. [3] have identified a unique astrovirus associated with SMS. The astrovirus associated with SMS and found in the brain tissue of minks was very similar to MiAstV in the ORF1a and ORF1b regions (88% and 98% homology, respectively) and a lower identity for ORF2 (67% and 59% homology for nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively) [3]. Interestingly, in 2007, a lethal case of human encephalitis occurred in a boy with X-linked agammaglobulinemia and an astrovirus phylogenetically distinct from HAstVs but related to MiAstV was detected in the brain tissue. Although the definitive source of infection remained unknown, it should be noted that the patient\u2019s residence was located in proximity to a mink farm [35].",

As for astrovirus infections in other species, the clinical significance of infection in sea mammals is unclear. In two cases (California sea lion and Steller sea lion) astroviruses were detected in young animals. The free-ranging California sea lion tested positive for astrovirus suffered from diarrhea but also had salmonella [37]. Genetic analyses of ORF1b and ORF2 indicate that these viruses do not cluster in a monophyletic group but across the Mamastrovirus tree, as confirmed by the proposal of reclassification submitted to the ICTV. Recombination analyses suggested that a recombination event may have occurred between a human strain (HAstV-4) and a CslAstV-2, possibly resulting in CslAstV-3 [37].",

In the ORF1b and ORF2 regions, batAstV AFCD337 has <55% and <27% amino acid similarity, respectively, to other known mammalian astroviruses. Characteristic features of BatAstV AFCD337 include a protease motif in ORF1a, an astrovirus \u201cslippery sequence\u201d (AAAAAC) at the junction between ORF1a and ORF1b which is required for inducing a ribosomal shift event, a RdRp motif in ORF1b and a conserved sequence at the end of ORF1b [8]. A conserved stem-loop structure that is predicted at the 3\u2032-end of the genomic RNA seen in human, ovine, porcine, and turkey astroviruses was not found in BatAst AFCD337 [8, 20, 22].",

The virus detection rates are high from apparently healthy animals and there is great genetic diversity even within bats of the same species at the same habitat at one sampling occasion (e.g., in Miniopterus bats within a single bat cave in Hong Kong). Astrovirus infections are typically acute short lasted infections and while virus detection rates >20% may be found in the context of outbreaks of infection, to find such (or even higher) detection rates repeatedly within a single species within one habitat is surprising. It is even more surprising to find high genetic diversity from animals within the same habitat at one sampling occasion, so that almost every animal has a genetically unique virus. The RdRp gene sequences of 50 viruses from one monophyletic group of astroviruses (from Miniopterus bats) are shown (Fig. 8.3). Pairwise genetic distances of the RdRp gene of these monophyletic viruses were estimated for all virus pairs and we found that 96.2% of these pair-wise distances were larger than or equal to 0.18 nucleotide substitution per site. In contrast, the pair-wise genetic distance analysis for all available typical human astroviruses worldwide was never larger than 0.17 nucleotide substitution per site. Thus >96% of all the pairs of bat astroviruses in this monophyletic group in a single habitat have diversity larger than that of typical human astroviruses considered globally.\n",

The observation that almost each virus detected in Miniopterus bats even in one sampling occasion was genetically unique is reminiscent of the findings on bat coronaviruses in this same population [7] and raises the question whether astroviruses may persistently infect bats and whether bats are unusual in their virus\u2013host interactions with these viruses. Longitudinal studies to re-sample tagged bats may be required to address these questions. An alternative explanation that these viruses found in bats are insect viruses ingested by these insectivorous bats is implausible given the close phylogeny with other mammalian viruses and also the clear clustering of viruses within bat families.",

The capsid gene is generally more genetically diverse than the RdRp gene. Thus, if these criteria are directly applied to astroviruses in bat populations, even within a single bat species, viruses from most individual bats within one bat species would qualify as a different virus species. This issue would have to be considered with some flexibility, especially in regard to bat astroviruses. Given that different bat species from different regions of China group together in monophyletic clades, even though their within group diversity is large, may have to be considered as one species.",
