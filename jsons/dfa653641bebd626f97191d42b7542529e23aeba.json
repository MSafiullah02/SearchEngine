All cases with excessive elevation of the INR (>8.0was collated from the anticoagulant clinic record and electronic patient records, which included patient characteristics, INR test frequency, drug compliance, co-medications, and changes in diet and alcohol intake as well as patient-reported events including bleeding. Bleeding events were defined by ISTH criteria3,4 . Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the incidence of high INRs during each time period. Root cause analysis was performed according to routine clinical practice, and the results reviewed by a panel of three in-house anticoagulation specialists. COVID-19 was defined as a risk factor for a high INR reading if the disease was possible or confirmed 5 .Results.During the 2020 reporting period, 30/3214 (0.9%) INR samples received were >8.0 (n=30 patients), compared to 6/4079 (0.1%) (n=6 patients) during the same period in the previous year (OR 6.3, 95% CI, 2.6 -15.2; p<.001).The time in therapeutic range during this period in 2020 was 69.6% compared with 73.7% in 2019.The characteristics of the patients with an INR>8 are described in table 1.",

UK guidance for anticoagulation services was issued (Guidance for the safe switching of warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for patients with non-valvular AF and venous thromboembolism (DVT / PE) during the coronavirus pandemic) with recommendations around maintaining safe anticoagulation whilst minimising exposure to COVID-19 infection 2 . These included switching to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) where appropriate, self-testing INRs, increasing the INR test interval for previously stable patients, and temporarily suspending anticoagulation with VKA therapy where this could no longer be safely continued. Despite implementation of these recommendations, we noted frequent high INR readings in clinical practice during this period. Routine practice at our institution is to perform root cause analysis on all INR results above >8.0. We report on the frequency of supra-therapeutic INR values during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous year and during lockdown and describe the findings of the root cause analysis.",
