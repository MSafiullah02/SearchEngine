            "text": "Anfinsen proposed that the proteins are predisposed to fold into a unique three dimensional structure which is clearly specified by its amino acid sequence, according to Anfinsen's dogma, the amino acid sequence of a protein contains sufficient information to determine its three-dimensional structure [1]. This broadly accepted theory was used as the central dogma in predicting the secondary and tertiary structures from its sequence alone following the pioneer work of Chou and Fasman [2]. Anfinsen's theory was shaken by the discovery of the chameleon sequences which can fold as different secondary structures in proteins, these sequences are abundant in nature and play a crucial role in human diseases and are said to constitute as part of the proteome named \u2018unfoldome\u2019 [3]. These segments with ambivalent structures were first reported by Kabsch and Sander [4]. Examples of related studies are the involvement of chameleon sequences in the induction of misfolding diseases such as amyloid fibril formation of neurodegeneration [5], [6], [7], [8]. Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc. involve a series of brain proteins named amyloid proteins, which upon interaction of the neuronal membranes monomers of amyloid proteins undergo an alpha helix to sheet shift in their conformation. These sequences are also suggested to be one of the limiting factors for the accuracy of secondary structure prediction methods and one important reason for misprediction of programs designed for protein secondary structures is the structural diversity among the peptides with the same sequence i.e. the chameleons [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The relationship of an amino acid sequence to its eventual structures is important for the structural prediction and design purposes as well as for the comprehension of diseases caused by a protein conformation [10], [14], [15], and the identification of the propensity values would provide local sequence information for predicting secondary structures [16], [17].",

Different amino acids have different preferences for their neighbors and that these local interactions are crucial for their structural conformation, and are also used in the secondary structure prediction methods [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Due to the importance of the chameleon sequences [5], [11], [13] and the involvement of the local amino acid interactions in secondary structure formation, we hereby present a comprehensive meta-analysis of single and double propensity of amino acids in chameleon sequences of the Protein databank (PDB), in order to find proteins with the most number of chameleons and name them Chameleon Flexible Proteins (CFPs). We have also built different chameleon groups corresponding to helix, strand and coil, along with the analysis of their solvent accessibility, presenting their singlet and doublet amino acid propensities.",

The 8 level secondary structural assignments in DSSP were reduced to the 3 classical states: helix including \u03b1, 310 and \u03c0-helices, strand the \u03b2 -strand assignments, and coil which covered the rest of our assignments (\u03b3-bridges, turns, bends and coils). For both datasets, three non-redundant sequence files were prepared based on DSSP (\u22654 amino acids). Our first file was sequences with helix conformations only, our second file was \u03b2-strands and the third was restricted to the coils or unstructured sequences. The tool for extracting segments with identical sequences and complete different secondary structures was designed using our in house C-sharp program. In this process, we found the helix sequences (list H) with the strand (list E) and the coil sequences (list C) by sliding the helix sequence along the strand sequence, one residue at a time. In addition, sequences which corresponded to the entire strands were searched against the helix and the coil sequences, and sequences that correlated with the entire coils were searched against the helix and strand sequences. Finding the same sequences was performed as followed: first, we searched for all possible identical 4 residues (4-mer) in one list (e.g. H list) and another list (e.g. E list) using a matching matrix, wherever possible. These residues were then extended to identify longer identical sequence pairs (4\u201312-mer). Contiguous, overlapping 4-mers that could form higher order n-mers were not retained in the 4-mer dataset and were assigned as the appropriate n-mer while only the longest possible n-mer was considered. Where one sequence from one list exactly matched the target sequence from another list, it was designated as a \u201cchameleon\u201d sequence for the corresponding protein, identified by its PDB code (e.g. HHHHH in one protein and EEEEE in another protein) and then they were classified into 3 distinct groups namely, Helix-Strand (HE-Chameleons), Helix-Coil (HC-Chameleons) and Coil\u2013Strand (CE-Chameleons). For each chameleon peptide, the peptide sequence length, the peptide sequence, the PDB code/chain, the protein name and the location of the chameleon sequence along the protein chain were recorded. Finally we sorted the proteins for their number of chameleons, in order to find the most flexible proteins in the protein databank.",

We assumed the neighbor-dependent propensity values as \u01a9x (a \u00b1 1) where the \u01a9x (a \u00b1 1) value of 1.0 means that the occurrence of the residue pair, ax (or xa), in the chameleon sequences is the same as its frequency of occurrence of the amino acid neighboring in the two types of structure involved in database. A value > 1.0 means that the pair has an occurrence in the chameleon sequences which is higher than its incident in the PDB, suggesting that the pair has a preference for adopting chameleon sequences. Furthermore, \u01a9x (a \u00b1 1) values lower than unity suggest less preference for the pair in the chameleon sequences, all of our singlet and doublet propensity calculations were mentioned in our previous studies [25], [29].",

Amyloidogenic sequences are misfolded peptides or proteins that represent a supersecondary structure which are somewhat insoluble, fibrous like and proteolysis resistant. As mentioned earlier, amyloid proteins are mostly chameleon sequences involved in the widely accepted hypothesis in this amyloidogenesis. Chameleon sequences are therefore the basic known sequences responsible for the disease initiation. Although these sequences lack a well-defined conformation they may be involved in various biological functions [14] in which their structural instability and mobile flexibility is encoded by their amino acid sequences. Therefore in this study, we performed an extensive survey of peptide sequences of varying lengths (\u22654 residues) with \u226425% sequence identity which could adopt either an \u03b1-helix structure in one protein and a \u03b2-strand or coil structures in another protein or a coil structure in one protein and an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-strand structure in another protein (HE, HC and CE chameleons). Our investigation is the first report in which all possible types of conformational pairs (HE, HC, CE-Chameleons) have been classified and the neighboring residues and their propensities were carefully analyzed. We found an extensive number of chameleon sequences, which each can be used as a base for further related studies on chameleon sequences and their role in biological functions, particularly amyloidogenesis and neurodegeneration. It is worth mentioning that these sequences are recently widely recognized, due to their widely biological importance [26], [35], and their significant role in disease-associated proteins [9], [35], [36]. Many studies showed that the sequence neighboring in secondary structure of proteins is crucial in forming these particular structures [7], [18], [19]. To our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive research on the occurrences of neighboring amino acid propensities (doublets) and disease enrichment analysis for all kinds of chameleon peptides. Our research showed that in general, the CE-Chameleon sequences are less abundant than the HE and HC Chameleons, but HC and HE show at a relatively comparable frequency in this study. This may be due to the more number of helices compared to the beta sheets in the PDB.",

This may indicate that aliphatic side-chained amino acids are preferred in chameleon sequences. The major challenge for neurodegenerative disease peptides is their propensity for aggregation which clearly stems from their hydrophobic residues [31]. Therefore our results show that not only hydrophobic residues are important, but close attention should be paid on Phe and Tyr as specific amino acids in chameleon sequences. The abundance of these two hydrophobic residues Phe and Tyr can clearly indicate these peptide properties for aggregation. Pro is the least amino acid present at these flexible regions. In other words, Pro residue is less abundant in all categories of the chameleons. This amino acid is unique among protein residues as it is a cyclic amino acid with no amide hydrogen to contribute in hydrogen bonding. Consequently, it cannot fit into the regular structure of either \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet and is a common \u2018breaker\u2019 of secondary structure [41]. Although it is said to be a helix initiator as well [25], but as to our knowledge it has never been reported to be abundant in the middle of a helix or any other secondary structure. Therefore, the disruptive nature of Pro in the context of a helix or a sheet structure may be the reason for its low frequency in the chameleon peptides. We can also categorize Pro as a low flexible amino acid to form a chameleon.",

Cys residues have also a low prevalence of occurrence in CE and HC-Chameleons. Since Cys tends to construct disulfide bonds which can impart higher stability to the sequence segment, therefore they could clearly inhibit the flexibility of sequences and hence it is rational not to be presented in these flexible regions. Our study revealed that Asp and Glu residues were found with a lower frequency in HE-Chameleon sequences. Our results confirm El Amiris studies [13]. But in contrast to Bhattacharjee's [10], the lack of Asp and Glu may be due to the acidic nature of these two amino acids which play an essential role in protein structures, and not to be restructured for their function. This is also in a very close agreement to the nature of neurodegenerative disease peptides with an aggregation nature in which these acidic amino acids give a more hydrophilic taste to the peptide, which prevents the required attachment for neurodegeneration.",

Although there has been a high desire to find such important sequences, other works were first of all not as stringent as ours for finding chameleon sequences and not as comprehensive as ours for finding all three kinds of chameleons [13], [26]. Sorting out our whole dataset in order to find the most flexible proteins based on the number of chameleons presented in the protein, we found PDB ID: 3CWW the Insulin Degrading Enzyme (IDE) which can be mentioned as the most flexible human protein in PDB. Although the most flexible human protein was calculated based on its number of chameleon sequences, interestingly this protein turned out to be a link between Alzheimer's disease and Type II diabetes [43]. The next major flexible protein with the highest number of chameleon was RAN, PDB ID: 4HAT this newly deposited transport protein has been mentioned to be responsible for nuclear localization of Huntington's protein. This may be due to the disruption of nucleus cytoplasmic transport which has said to impair neuronal function, and literature supports that this mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders [44]. We can therefore conclude that extracting the chameleon sequences and finding proteins with high number of chameleons can lead us to major proteins responsible in neurodegenerative disorders, although their role might have not yet been proved in lab experiments, investigations can be designed based on our Chameleon Flexible Proteins (CFP's).",
