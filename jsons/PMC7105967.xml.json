It has become a public health emergency of international concern [1, 2]. There are 109,577 confirmed cases, 28,673 of which are in 104 countries outside of China on March 9th, 2020 [3]. Japan is one of the countries on the brink of an expansion with 457 cases by 12:00 March 10, 2020 [4]. Though the incidence still remains low in comparison with China, the number of cases difficult to identify infection routes is gradually increasing. It is considered that Japan has entered a new phase of the outbreak, switching focus from screening overseas arrivals to catching homegrown cases.",

Tao et al. also reported high sensitivity of chest CT (97%) among patients with positive RT-PCR results in Wuhan, the epicenter [7]. However, the reported CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia, such as ground glass opacity (GGO) or bilateral involvement [10], are nonspecific and could be found in other infections and inflammatory conditions [14]. Thus, the diagnostic performance of chest CT in a clinical setting, where the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia is lower than that of other respiratory diseases, is still unknown. Considering the rapid spread around the world, there is an urgent need to investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms.",

Three patients with no chest CT were also excluded (all excluded cases were proved uninfected later). Thus, the final cohort consisted of 21 patients.

They assessed the following features: (1) the presence or absence of GGO and/or consolidation, (2) distribution (peripheral predominance and bilaterality), (3) characteristics of opacities (rounded morphology, cavitation, crazy-paving pattern, and reversed halo sign), (4) airway abnormalities (bronchial wall thickening and airway secretions), (5) underlying lung disease (pulmonary emphysema and fibrosis), (6) other findings [pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (\u2267 10 mm in short-axis dimension)], (7) a number of lobes affected, and (8) a total lung severity score. Assessments of GGO, consolidation, cavity, crazy-paving pattern, and reversed halo sign were according to the definitions of Fleischner Society [16].

Due to the limited number of RT-PCR kits and the possibility of false negative results, chest CT is becoming recognized as a vital component in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia [9]. In this study, we analyzed the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 6) in Japan, compared with those of other respiratory diseases initially suspected COVID-19 pneumonia.

Our criteria were created with simple CT features easy to understand, so that they can be clinically feasible. The combination of these criteria could be a powerful tool to triage patients based on the estimation of the probability of COVID-19 in a clinical setting. For example, patients who meet the criterion (e) should be highly suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with patients who meet all the criteria but the criterion (e).",

This might be because we only included chest CT scans performed more than 3 days after the symptom onset. The differences of chest CT images between COVID-19 pneumonia and other respiratory diseases might become clearer after this time interval. Another reason might be the difference of prior probabilities. Bai et al. reported the great variation of specificity (24\u201394%) among seven readers in the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia (cases in China) from viral pneumonia (cases in USA) [13]. In our studies, the specificities for the respective criteria showed less variation as above.
