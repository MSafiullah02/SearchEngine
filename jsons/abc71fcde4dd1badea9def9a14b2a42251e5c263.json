Materials and methods We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. Results We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. Conclusion Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.",

On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses referred to a new coronavirus capable of infecting humans as SARS-CoV-2 [3] . On the same day, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease caused by this virus is COVID-19 [4] . As of 4 March 2020, there were 93,094 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 77 countries, with 80,422 in China [5] . According to recently published literature, similar to previously reported coronavirus infections, the typical radiographic image of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 is parenchymal destruction expressed as ground-glass opacities and consolidation [6] . It has been reported that the susceptible population to the virus is mainly older adults with low immunity, and there have been few reports of paediatric patients [7] . Our objective was to present preliminary findings of abnormalities at chest CT in children with proven COVID-19.",
