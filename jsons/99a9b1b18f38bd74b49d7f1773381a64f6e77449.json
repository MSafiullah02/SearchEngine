A potential therapeutic strategy warranting investigation is to inhibit complement, with case reports of successful treatment of COVID-19 with inhibitors of complement 10-13 . However, this approach requires careful balance between the host protective and potential injurious effects of complement activation, and biomarkers to identify the optimal timing and candidates for therapy are lacking. Here we report the presence of complement activation products on circulating erythrocytes from hospitalized COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry. These findings suggest that novel erythrocyte-based diagnostics provide a method to identify patients with dysregulated complement activation. : medRxiv preprint deposition on circulating RBCs would provide a sensitive measure to detect complement activation that may be occurring in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.",

This multi-tiered and highly coordinated system is vital for the innate immune response to pathogens, removal of dead cells and maintenance of homeostasis. Initially described as a complement to antibody mediated immunity, it was later discovered that the complement system is evolutionarily older than antibody-mediated immunity and its activation can be initiated by lectins and by a C3 tick-over mechanism. Thus, the three pathways of complement activation can be engaged by distinct initiators including antigenantibody complexes (classical pathway), lectins (lectin pathway) and spontaneous C3 hydrolysis (alternative pathway). Although the complement system promotes clearance of pathogens through opsonization, inflammation and cytolysis, dysregulated complement activation can lead to cellular injury, microvascular thrombosis and organ failure 14 . The latter point is highlighted by several well-characterized human diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) that result from complement dysregulation 15, 16 . Animal models with complement regulator deficiencies or mutations have also demonstrated development of tissue injury, coagulopathy and thrombotic microangiopathy caused by insufficient complement regulation 17 .",
