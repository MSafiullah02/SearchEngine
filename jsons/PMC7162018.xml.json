Notably, these recommendations do not restrict fresh fruits and vegetables.47 Stricter restrictions are usually applied for stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients and neutropenic patients with an absolute neutrophil count below 500 cells/mm3 and include avoidance of raw fruits and vegetables, undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk and cheeses, and well water from private or public wells.48 However, there is no clear evidence that strict dietary restrictions are associated with a lower risk for infectious complications. Two recent studies have questioned the value of a neutropenic diet. A randomized study in 150 pediatric patients who were receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy in which groups were assigned to either a neutropenic diet or US Food and Drug Administration\u2010approved food\u2010safety guidelines found no difference in the prevention of infections.49 In fact, a retrospective evaluation of 726 patients at Northwestern Memorial Hospital reported a higher rate of infections in HCT recipients who followed a neutropenic diet compared with those who consumed a general hospital diet.50\n",

In particular, a portable UV light germicidal device using pulsed xenon lamps (PX\u2010UV) has been shown to be a safe, easy\u2010to\u2010operate, and effective system for decreasing the number of pathogens in the environment. PX\u2010UV uses a xenon flash lamp to generate broad\u2010spectrum, high\u2010intensity UV light to deactivate and kill bacteria, spores, and viruses on high\u2010touch surfaces in 5 minutes or less.179 PX\u2010UV was evaluated in clinical hematologic and bone marrow units, and it provided an overall reduction of 90% in total aerobic colony counts compared with a 76% reduction with manual cleaning.180 At MD Anderson, we observed that PX\u2010UV light was noninferior compared with bleach for decreasing C. difficile spores from patients' rooms,181 as described in a recent systematic review of over 20 studies in which the use of automated UV\u2010C light devices achieved a significant reduction in C. difficile infections (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49\u20100.84) and VRE infections (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28\u20100.65); however, there was no significant impact on the rates of infection with MRSA or MDR\u2010GNB.182 In a recent cluster\u2010randomized, multicenter, crossover study, there was a decrease in the target organisms (mainly C. difficile) in exposed patients after adding UV\u2010C light (using mercury devices) to standard cleaning, but this decreased rate was not associated with a change in the incidence of C. difficile infection.183 Therefore, further data are needed to clearly determine the benefits of UV light, but enhanced terminal cleaning may be part of the solution. Some of the drawbacks for the use of automated methods has been cost\u2010effectiveness and logistical problems, including the ability of the systems to reach certain areas, the need for furniture rearrangement in the rooms for its use, and longer cleaning times of an average 1 hour per room.184 More recently, we were able to demonstrate equivalent efficiency in reduction of colony counts (approximately 73%) on high\u2010touch surface areas between cycles of 2 and 8 minutes using the PX\u2010UV system at a single position in the operating rooms.185\n",
