The method combines terminological processing and dependency parsing of journal articles, and applies information extraction techniques to profile Web services using informative textual passages, related ontological annotations and service descriptors. Service descriptors are terminological phrases reflecting related concepts (e.g. tasks, approaches, data) and/or specific roles (e.g. input/output parameters, etc.) of the associated resource classes (e.g. algorithms, databases, etc.). They can be used to facilitate subsequent manual description of services, but also for providing a semantic synopsis of a service that can be used to locate related services. We present a case-study involving full text articles from the BMC Bioinformatics journal. We illustrate the potential of natural language processing not only for mining descriptions of known services, but also for discovering new services that have been described in the literature.",

These resources need to be organised and their functionalities semantically described to make them accessible by both bioinformaticians and search/discovery engines. A number of projects 2 (e.g. myGrid, BioMOBY, BioCatalogue, myExperiment etc.) have been initiated to comprehensively catalogue these resources and provide their semantic descriptions (see Table 1 for an example). Most of the cataloguing frameworks, however, rely on manual annotation that has resulted in a backlog of non-described services, reducing the chance of their discovery and use in the community [1] .

For example, Carman and Knoblock presented an automatic approach to learn definitions and semantic descriptions of online information resources by invoking them and comparing the output they produce with that of known sources of information [4] . On the basis of this comparison, they used the metadata associated with known sources to add annotations to unknown sources. The method was evaluated on 25 services from five domains (geospatial, financial, weather, hotels and cars) -the precision ranged between 56% and 91%. Lerman et al. presented a meta-data based classification algorithm that used WSDL files to perform semantic labelling of inputs and outputs of Web services [5] . The semantic types were organised in the form of a domain ontology. The method was evaluated on 313 WSDL files from different domains, with an overall F-measure of approximately 80%. Previously, Hess and Kushmerick annotated Web services using machine learning to classify metadata used to describe those services [6] . Information about the services given in WSDL files was used in this work. Finally, Belhajjame et al. performed automatic annotation of parameters using workflow annotations, by inferring from their links to other (annotated) operation parameters within existing workflows [7] .",

For example, a PAS can comprise a verb along with its arguments, e.g. subject and object(s). The Stanford parser 3 , for instance, identifies dependencies in the form dep(abc, xyz) where dep is the dependency type (e.g. nominal subject (nsub), direct object (dobj), etc.), and abc and xyz are arguments. For example, dependency statement nsubj (applied, BLAST) denotes BLAST as the nominal subject of applied. Wattarujeekrit et al. argued the significance of using PAS-based extraction compared to regular expressions applied on shallow parsed sentences, in particular for event extraction in the biomedical domain [8] . Similarly, Tateisi et al. demonstrated the need and benefits of recognising predicate-argument structures for improving the performance of information extraction systems in biology [9] . Our method also uses predicate-argument structures, but additionally incorporates the phrase-structure recognition and intensive terminological processing in the process of service profiling.",

As opposed to other classes whose instances are expressed using noun phrases, tasks are typically represented by verbs or verbal phrases portraying functions related to other classes. We therefore followed two methods to identify SCs: for the first four classes we compiled dictionaries with instances, while for the task class we used information extraction rules (see Section 3.3). In the following text we refer to the nontask classes as SCs for simplicity, while tasks will be considered separately. We used iterative terminological processing to collect and classify instances belonging to the SCs. In the first step, we extracted a number of instances by identifying typical terminological heads of a given SC (e.g. Smith-Waterman algorithm is an algorithm). The set of key terminological heads was obtained by exploring the first level of the myGrid ontology. We then examined a list of 100,000 bioinformatics terms previously collected in the process of building a controlled vocabulary 4 (CV) of bioinformatics [10] .

Table 5 presents the number of functional descriptions collected for each of the four semantic classes (Section 3.3). For each service instance, a complete profile was generated (Figure 3) . The extracted description profiles were evaluated manually by a MyGrid bioinformatics service curator, who evaluated the following three components: the quality of the associated myGrid ontological terms, the quality of service descriptors and the quality of textual descriptions.

A semantic profile of each service/tool was generated by combining descriptive sentences, semantic descriptors, links to other related tools, and semantic labels linked to the my-Grid ontology. The presented case-study involving a subset of full text articles from BMC Bioinformatics illustrated the potential of natural language processing not only for mining descriptions of known services, but also for discovering and describing new services that have been mentioned in the literature.",
