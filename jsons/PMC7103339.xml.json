These diseases are also called communicable diseases due to their ability to get transmitted from one person to another (malaria, tuberculosis) and also sometimes from one species to another (flu, influenza). Infectious diseases can be broadly classified as: a) known diseases which are persistently there (e.g., dengue, malaria, tuberculosis); b) new, previously unknown diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome); and c) diseases which threaten to increase in the near future (e.g., avian influenza). These diseases possess a great threat as more than half of the deaths occurring worldwide can be attributed to these diseases, especially in developing countries.",

An estimated of 200,000 cases are reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) annually. Recent years have seen dengue outbreaks all over Asia and Africa, with a WHO estimate of 50 million cases of dengue fever appear each year. Several influenza epidemics in the 20th century caused millions of death worldwide, including the worst epidemic; the Spanish influenza outbreak that killed more than 500,000 people in 1918. Today influenza is less of a public health threat, though it continues to be a serious disease that affects many people. Malaria almost eradicated 30 years ago, is on the rise again, affecting more than 500 million people annually, causing between 1 and 3 million deaths. Measles has seen a drastic reduction in countries where a vaccine is already available, but it is still prevalent in developing countries. Rotavirus the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide kills more than 600,000 children year each, mostly in developing countries. Tuberculosis causes nearly 2 million deaths every year, and WHO estimates that nearly 1 million people will be infected between 2000 and 2020 if more effective procedures are not adopted. Typhoid fever causes and estimated 600,000 deaths annually, out of 12\u201317 million cases [1].

The following are common methods that are currently used for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and these methods are either used independently or in combination with each other.1.Microbial culture: This is the most common method where the pathogenic agent is allowed to grow in the specific growth medium and then detected based on the size, shape, color of the colony formed and the changes brought by their growth.2.Microscopy: The samples taken directly from the patients (sputum, blood, urine, stool, etc.) can be viewed under the microscope for the detection and identification of the pathogenic agent. Microscopy can also be used in combination with biochemical staining and/or fluorescently labeled antibodies. Both optical microscopes and fluorescence microscopes are used for imaging pathogenic agent.3.Biochemical tests: These tests are capable of identifying the target pathogenic agent based on the detection of metabolic or enzymatic products characteristic of that agent. Acids, alcohols and gases are usually detected in these tests.4.Immunoassays: These are the most widely used tests that are based on the detection of specific binding event of an antibody to its antigen. The antigen\u2013antibody complex is detected by labeling either the antigen or the antibody. The methods for labeling includes enzyme (Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay, ELISA), radioisotopes (radio-immunoassays), magnetic labels (magnetic immunoassays), fluorescent labels (fluoroimmunoassays) or colloidal gold (lateral-flow assays).5.Molecular diagnostics: This method is based on changes in genomic and proteomic expression patterns due to infection by pathogenic agent. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method is usually used to amplify the target DNA or RNA for reliable detection.\n",

The major drawback is that most of these methods are laborious and time consuming as they involve the pathogen amplification step. Current methods for bacteria detection require microorganism to grow into visible colonies, which take 1\u20135 days. Methods that rely upon fluorescent molecular probes such as molecular beacons (a single-stranded DNA probe with hairpin-like structure; one end of the strand is attached to a fluorescent dye and the other end to a fluorescent quencher), suffer from severe photo-bleaching of the fluorescent dye that limits long-term analysis. Moreover, these probes are not highly sensitive for early detection. Similar limitations are observed using fluorescent protein based probes. Another drawback is that some of these methods do not provide the information whether or not a pathogen is infectious (strain specific).",

Thus, better and widely available diagnostic methods are required to control infectious diseases in developing countries. Unfortunately, some of the commonly used methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases are not quite cost-effective for wide implementation in developing countries. With the limited resources available in these countries, development of highly cost-effective and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests would be attractive and must receive highest priority [2]. In this context, nanodiagnostics have strong potential in introducing reliable, rapid, cost-effective, easy-to-use diagnostic methods that could benefit developing countries in the near future.",

The large surface area of nanomaterials enables attachment of large number of target-specific molecules of interest for ultra-sensitive detection. With such capability, diagnosis at the molecular and single cell level is possible. Because of high sensitivity, nanotechnology enables detection of a few microorganisms or target molecular analytes specific to pathogens. Conventional methods are limited to achieve this ultra-sensitivity. In addition, unique properties of nanomaterials could allow rapid (as short as few minutes) and real-time detection of the pathogens. Moreover, relatively small sample volumes are required for the tests.

Surface modification is usually required for improving their aqueous dispersibility and biocompatibility, and obtaining appropriate surface functional groups for bioconjugation purposes. Surface attachment of biorecognition elements such as proteins, antibodies, DNA, etc. to NPs is usually carried out using conventional bioconjugate chemistries. Biomolecules can be attached to NPs through direct linkage by either physical adsorption or covalent coupling. In physical adsorption, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between biomolecules and the NPs dominate over the interaction among NPs. Limitations of physical adsorption are: (i) less control on the number of attached biomolecules per NPs, (ii) orientation of biomolecules, and (iii) desorption of biomolecules. Covalent coupling is preferred to avoid these limitations. Covalent coupling of the biomolecules to NPs is usually done after modifying the surface of NPs with functional group(s) of interest, for example, sulfide, amine or carboxyl groups. In addition to providing site for biomolecule conjugation, the functional groups also play crucial role in controlling colloidal stability of the NPs.",

            "text": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae and is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections. It has two characteristic surface proteins: F protein (fusion protein of the virus) and G protein (attachment protein of the virus); and it gets its name from the F protein which causes the cell membranes on nearby cells to merge, forming syncytia. A joint study carried out by Tripp and Nie groups demonstrated the suitability of using dual color Qdots for real-time detection of single virus particles and viral protein expression [6]. Their study was based on the principles of microcapillary flow cytometry and single molecule detection for high sensitivity that involved two types of fluorescent NPs: (i) 40-nm carboxyl-modified fluorescent NPs, (named, G NPs, 505/515; R NPs, 488/685) and (ii) streptavidin-coated Qdots 488/605. For the RSV detection, 40 nm NPs were coupled to either anti-RSV F protein or anti-RSV G protein monoclonal antibodies and allowed to interact with RSV. The photons produced by the laser excitation of the fluorophores were detected in the real time. This system operates on the concept that if two NPs are free to move in a solution, photons generated by them will arrive at the detector at different times unless they are bound to the same target. Hence, this can be used to detect target molecules at low concentrations with high sensitivity and discriminate between aggregate particles. Furthermore, a relative amount of surface F protein expression can be determined using this Qdot nanotechnology.",

For this study, two bioconjugated NPs (green and red emitting) were designed to recognize the same target molecule at two different sites. For RSV detection, the F protein antibody was conjugated to red emitting NPs and the G protein antibody was conjugated to green antibody. The sandwich-type binding brings two color-coded NPs together to form a NP pair with the RSV (wild type) for which both G and F proteins are expressed on the virus surface. Upon binding, the green\u2013red pair moves in the solution as a single complex. When excited by a laser beam (488 nm excitation), the pair emits green and red fluorescence light simultaneously (i.e. time correlation). Real-time coincidence analysis of single photon events confirmed the presence of RSV in the sample. Tripp et al. demonstrated rapid and specific detection of RSV both in vitro and in vivo\n[8] using monoclonal antibody anti-F protein conjugated to 585 nm and 540 nm emitting cadmium telluride Qdots (RSV-NPs). These RSV-NPs were used also to quantitate RSV titers in a single-step fashion, thereby shortening the detection time needed to quantitate virus titers by plaque assay. These RSV-NPs were able to detect RSV plaques 2 days earlier than compared with conventional immunostaining, hence, indicating that the single-step RSV-NPs procedure is more sensitive in detecting limiting levels of RSV.",

Both antibody-Qdot and DNA aptamer-Qdot conjugates exhibited dramatic blue shift of at least 140 nm upon binding to the bacterial surface. The authors attributed this shift to the changes in the chemical environment and physical deformation of the Qdot conjugate upon binding to bacteria.

As a proof of concept three targets were taken (hepatitis B virus, HBV; hepatitis C virus, HCV; and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) and three different Qdot-barcodes (QdotB) with different wavelengths (QdotB1\u2014570 nm; QdotB2\u2014615 nm, QdotB3\u2014570 and 615 nm).

This assay protocol can also be integrated into microfluidic chip to minimize human involvement in the entire detection process and according to the authors the sensitivity can also be further enhanced.

The assay is based on direct antigen detection via sandwich forming immunoreactions using these NPs and high affinity monoclonal antibodies.

The lactose-stabilized NPs were stable on freeze drying and could be resuspended in water to detect the cholera toxin in an electrolyte solution that mimicked the watery stool that is typical of cholera patients to test the selectivity for the toxin.

But ELISA will not be able to detect the infection at an early stage as the antibodies against HCV antigens will not be produced then. Also, detectable antibodies could be absent in HCV infection that may be present in immunocompromised patients. The need for a direct RNA based test to detect the presence of HCV at an early stage of infection has motivated Ray and coworkers for screening and quantifying sequence-specific HCV RNA using non-linear optical properties of Au NPs by Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) technique [51]. The assay is based on the fact that double and single-stranded oligonucleotides have different electrostatic properties. A fluorescent Raman dye rhodamine 6G tagged ssRNA was adsorbed onto the Au NPs. Fluorescence quenching of the dye and the enhancement of resonant Raman scattering from the dye were observed. Upon binding to the target RNA, duplex structure of the double stranded (ds) RNA is formed. Electrostatic repulsion between the ds RNA and the NP causes the ds RNA not to adsorb onto the Au NPs and the fluorescence of the dye persists. As soon as the ds RNA is separated from the Au NPs, a second effect is observed which is the aggregation of the Au NPs. This aggregation is evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and further confirmed by colorimetric studies. The aggregation causes increase in size resulting in increase in HRS intensity thereby confirming the detection of HCV virus RNA.

Another method is to react carbodiimide activated carboxyl functionalized magnetic NPs to the primary amine group of the vancomycin [72].

The magnetic separation effectively reduced the interference of protein and metabolite signals in the mass spectra as vancomycin has high specificity to the bacterial cell walls. Vancomycin conjugated MNPs were able to isolate pathogens at concentrations of 7 \u00d7 104\n CFU/ml from the urine sample.

These various anchoring strategies resulted in a change in the orientation/architecture of the vancomycin probe on the NP surface which had a critical influence on the efficient capture of pathogenic bacteria such as E. faecalis, S. epidermidis etc. The magnetically isolated bacteria were determined via plate counting of the NP\u2013pathogen conjugates.

The working principle of these assays to image, detect and capture infectious virus and bacteria in solutions or biological samples was discussed along with pros and cons of these assays. Detection methods such as flow cytometry, spectroscopy (absorption, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence, IR etc.), microscopy and visualization by naked eye that were used in these assays were discussed. Key features of nanodiagnostic assays were identified that include sensitivity, multiplexing capabilities and reduced sample volume. These features could provide excellent results for in vitro diagnostics of infectious diseases and could be further extended to in vivo diagnosis. Yet another attractive advantage is the application of nanodiagnostic assays into portable, easy to perform and read out diagnostic tools that are cost-effective.",

However, when applying these innovations to developing countries or low resource settings, the user requirement needs understanding [82]. A diagnostic test requirement would be based on the infectious disease type as well as the different levels of health care facilities such as the community/rural health facility, the district/town hospital and the urban hospital. In developing countries, rural patients can often be misdiagnosed due to lack of access to diagnostic tests such as the diagnosis of malaria instead of HIV [83]. A lateral-flow based diagnostic testing or a test strip membrane would be very beneficial as by mere visualization of the test, the presence of an infection can be determined rapidly. This would prevent spreading of the infection, false diagnosis and resistance to the medication as in the case of bacterial infections. A quantitative test may not be of much use for a community or rural health worker while it may be more informative to a doctor at a hospital or clinic. But these quantitative tests often are expensive, require specialized equipments and highly trained technicians to carry out the analysis. Researchers have used specialized equipments such as flow cytometry, SQUID, spectroscopic techniques, TEM, confocal microscopy etc., to analyze trace amount of the pathogen. Some of these equipments may be acquired by a few urban hospitals but the cost factor and access to such facilities are not at reach to a large number of people in developing countries.",
