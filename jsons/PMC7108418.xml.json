            "text": "Molecular biology has revolutionized all domains of viruses diagnosis including the rapid identification of emerging or re-emerging viruses, viral safety of blood products or organ transplants and viral disease management. One of the major driving forces for the introduction of molecular techniques in virology has been the absence of easy and performing multiplication techniques similar to those developed for bacteriology. The most striking illustration of the power of molecular techniques concerns blood transmitted viruses\u2014human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for which spectacular progresses in the detection and treatment of viral diseases have been made following the introduction of qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid tests (NAT). The recent discovery of a new human coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic is another example. It is obvious that NAT will encourage the development of antiviral drugs which, compared to antibiotics, has been delayed partly because performing efficiency assessment techniques were lacking.",

HCV and HIV testing has been implemented as part of routine screening in blood banks in 14 and 7 European countries respectively. In France, two commercial offers \u2013 Procleix (Gen-Probe, Inc. USA) and NucliSens Extractor (bioMerieux, France) associated with Cobas Ampliscreen (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland)\u2014are used to screen donations for HIV and HCV infections. This allowed the reduction of residual risk from 1 in 400,000 to 1 in 2.5 millions for HIV and 1 in 760,000 to 1 in 5 millions for HCV (Assal et al., 2003). However, there is room from improvement as few contaminated blood units are still missed due to the lack of sensitivity induced by pooling strategies. Cost constraints must also be considered if further improvements are to be considered. Cost effectiveness of HIV and HCV NAT addition to serology testing is already very low: in USA it has been calculated that the cost of each saved life is 4.7\u201311.2 millions US$ per year (Jackson et al., 2003).",

The increasing number of available antiviral drugs will even accentuate the need for positive viral identification.

The most striking examples are found in the norovirus family which contains viruses responsible for the vast majority of gastro-intestinal epidemics in adults. HIV diagnosis is also quite difficult to achieve due to its high genetic variability. Gardner et al. (2003) have deduced from sequence alignments that a real-time TaqMan assay should contain not less than nine primer and probe sets to detect with the same sensitivity all HIV strains in a geographically representative panel. To reduce the impact of variability on amplification and detection efficiency, one can use primers and probes with 2\u2032 O-methyl bases, degenerate bases or \u201cuniversal\u201d bases, such as inosine or nebularine. Touchdown PCR protocols, in which the annealing temperature slightly decreases during the successive amplification cycles to bracket the melting temperature Tm of the reaction, provides sensitivity even when primers have mismatches with target sequences of divergent species in a viral family. Finally, degenerate primers or probes, with mixtures of the bases found in sequence databases among various species, may be useful to detect all species of a viral family.",

            "text": "It is often desirable to provide the capability for panel detection, i.e. to detect several viruses that can be responsible for a disease. For example, Coyle et al. have described at the winter meeting of European Society for Clinical Virology (Copenhagen, January 2004) a molecular viral respiratory strip for the detection of 12 common respiratory viruses. Whenever possible, consensus primers able to detect all viruses from a family or genus must be used. There are several examples of such consensus primers for enterovirus (Kammerer et al., 1994), flavivirus (Scaramozzino et al., 2001) or Herpesviridae (Tenorio et al., 1993). However, their ability to amplify all viruses with the same efficiency must be carefully evaluated. If such an approach is not possible, two different possibilities exist for panel detection: multiplex detection in single tubes or parallel detection in individual tubes. Mixing primers in a single amplification tube to achieve multiplex detection of viruses usually results in decreased sensitivity of assays compared to single tests. For example, we have observed, using a DNA-microarray assay (see below), that the analytical sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCR detection of six viruses, i.e. influenza A, influenza B, RSV A/B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 is reduced by a factor of <1\u20132 logs compared to single detections, depending on the virus. Nevertheless, this multiplex assay was able to identify correctly 21/22 infections in respiratory specimen (one RSV B infection was misidentified as RSV A; unpublished data). The formation of primer dimers is generally considered as the major cause of sensitivity loss but careful optimisation of all parameters of amplification including primer, enzymes, nucleotides and salts concentrations as well as protocol conditions are required to obtain expected performances. Real-time assays (see below) that monitor signal apparition during the amplification step are also limited in their capacity to realize multiplex detection by the number of available wavelengths in existing equipments which currently allows the detection of three viruses only. Instead of mixing several pairs of primers in a single tube, nucleic acids purified from the original clinical specimen can be distributed into several tubes for independent amplification and detection. Major drawbacks of this approach are the reduction of sensitivity because of lower amounts of nucleic acid available for each individual amplification, higher hands-on times required to manipulate all the different tubes, difficulty to automate the distribution of small volumes of purified nucleic acids without introducing cross-contaminations and higher costs due to the need for enzymes in each tube.",

Because inhibitors of the amplification reaction, which are frequent in some specimen types, will also impact its amplification, the presence of an IC is a strong validation in case of negative result. Niesters (2002) has described an original approach for internal control of NAT: the use of viral universal controls that can be added to each specimen and be amplified with specific primers, preferably in a multiplex format with primers for the virus to detect. Seal herpes virus 1 and phocine distemper virus can be used to control NAT for DNA and RNA viruses respectively. Of course, animal viruses which can not infect humans are required. Other strategies for IC involve synthetic materials, i.e. plasmids or transcripts which contain sequences able to bind the test primers and a specific probe.",

Several probe technologies (Fig. 1\n) have also been designed for real-time assays like TaqMan (Fig. 1A) or molecular beacons (Fig. 1B) in which a quencher molecule is removed from the vicinity of the fluorescent marker upon binding to RNA or DNA generated during amplification cycles. In the FRET technology (Fig. 1C), two probes, one with a fluorescence donor and one with a fluorescence acceptor molecule are designed to bind adjacent sequences of the amplified material to generate signal (Mackay et al., 2002). Real-time techniques have been designed for PCR or NASBA amplification and have several advantages which facilitate automation and reduce time-to-result (30\u2013120 min) and hands-on-times. They are performed in closed devices which do not need to be opened to transfer amplified material for end-point detection, thus reducing the risk of laboratory or samples cross-contamination.

New European Community regulations will even increase this need. It is the role of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) companies to provide reagents which are the results of careful optimisation and are produced according to high quality manufacturing procedures. They have clinical and regulatory affairs departments that conduct validation studies and assemble documentation required to get approval of the reagents. However, even for IVD companies, the conception and validation process is time-consuming and time-to-market may be long. This is especially a problem when a diagnostic tool is urgently needed in case of emergence of a new virus. One possibility to reduce time-to-market is to release \u201cresearch use only\u201d (RUO) assays or assays that have the \u201cCE analytical\u201d approval in Europe or the status of \u201canalyte specific reagent\u201d (ASR) in the USA. In this case, commercial products that have excellent analytical sensitivity and are manufactured according to quality standards of the IVD industry can be used by clinical virology laboratories, which have the responsibility to validate their use as diagnostic tools and obtain authorization to use them.",

Platforms like Amplicor Amplicor from Roche Diagnostics or EasyQ from bioMerieux that are usually used for viral load measurement during therapy (see below) are also suitable for the early detection of HIV or HCV infections. Many other infections and especially acute infections for which IgM appear only several days after onset of symptoms cannot be efficiently diagnosed using serology assays. Forty to sixty percent of community acquired pneumonia that require hospitalisation have no known aetiology despite intensive investigation and this percentage is even higher when less severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are considered (L. Kaiser, personal communication). In a recent study, Henrickson et al. (2004), have shown, using multiplex RT-PCR that 40% of children hospitalised for LRTI are infected with the seven most common respiratory viruses. Similarly, a recent survey of encephalitis leading to hospitalisation in the USA from 1988 to 1997 has revealed that nearly 60% had no aetiology (Khetsuriani et al., 2002). Absence of specific antiviral treatments for most viruses, which limits prescription of biological tests and weak performances of diagnostic tests based on viral culture or serology are major explanations of this situation.",

Sequence signatures are identified using extensive sequence databases because they are conserved in all viruses of a genus or family or in all subtypes or isolates of a virus and are not found in other viruses. For each base of the signature, probes perfectly matching the target and probes with a mismatch at the interrogated position are present on the array. If polymorphisms are present in or near the signature, variant probes may also be present. Consensus primers have been designed for enterovirus, flavivirus, herpesviridae, parainfluenza and influenza virus, RSV and adenovirus. They can be combined in multiplex detection PCR or RT-PCR assays for the diagnosis of viral respiratory or CNS infections. Following amplification, DNA is labelled using a newly developed diazomethyl chemistry (Laayoun et al., 2003). A complete line of instruments (sample preparation, thermocycler, hybridisation station and laser scanner) is available to perform the assay. As described above, a respiratory assay designed to detect six major viruses (parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, RSV A/B, influenza A and B) in a single specimen has demonstrated high clinical sensitivity in preliminary evaluation.
