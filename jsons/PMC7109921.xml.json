Different primer and probe combinations were evaluated for the NL63 and HKU1 assays, and those with the most efficient amplification were selected for further studies. All real-time assays were internally specific for the other HCoVs, and no amplification was obtained with other respiratory viral pathogens\u2014including influenza viruses A and B, RSV, HPIV1\u20134, HMPV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, HBoV, and SARS-CoV\u2014 or with human DNA. All assays were successfully validated against 31 clinical specimens previously shown to be positive for HCoVs by alternate methods; 3 specimens originally reported to be positive for OC43 by RT-PCR [30] were identified as being HKU1 by the real-time assay and were confirmed by sequencing. The sensitivity of each assay was determined by testing limiting dilutions of specific viral RNA transcripts, and all 4 HCoV assays could detect as few as 5 copies. Every assay in the panel detected 15 (100%) of 15 and 15 (100%) of 15 replicates of 500 and 50 copies, respectively. The OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63 assays detected 5 (33.3%) of 15, 14 (93.3%) of 15, 5 (33.3%) of 15, and 12 (80.0%) of 15 replicates of 5 copies, respectively. All 4 assays achieved linear amplification of respective RNA transcripts ranging from 5\u00d7101 to 5\u00d7105 copies. Reaction efficiencies, slopes, and R2 values for these assays were 100%, \u20143.32, and 0.99 for OC43; 99.2%, \u20143.34, and 0.99 for 229E; 100%, -3.32, and 0.99 for HKU1; and 99.6%, \u20143.33, and 1.00 for NL63, respectively. Limited attempts to multiplex the reactions in a single tube resulted in reduced assay sensitivity, and these studies were not pursued further (data not shown).",

Only 55%\u201359% of patients admitted to a Sa Kaeo Province hospital with signs and symptoms of clinical pneumonia had a CXR taken, and only 37%\u201351% of these were enrolled in the study; children and severely ill patients were less likely to enroll. Second, adults were underrepresented in the outpatient sample. Third, we found a high proportion of patients infected with HCoV to be coinfected with other viruses, especially among those infected with NL63, making it difficult to determine the responsible etiology; however, we tested for more viruses than have other studies [26]. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that some control patients may have been shedding HCoV following an earlier symptomatic infection. Using sensitive PCR assays, van Elden et al. [26] reported detecting HCoV 14 days after illness. Future studies that include control subjects should account for this possibility.",
