Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up. In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool. SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients. In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients.",

They conclude that chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 and may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas [4] . However, the strategy of using CT as a screening method does not appear to be supported by solid basis. Using CT in screening and/or asymptomatic patients, the probability to find radiological signs of COVID-19 infection is low and therefore the use of CT would lead to many negative tests (even in patients with rRT-PCR positive tests), thus increasing the workload of the radiology departments and the risk of transmission of the infection.",

There are in fact many ethical and medico-legal implications in the use of this technology that, even in this emergency situation, do not allow its routine use [23] [24] [25] . As for any new technology, a clinical validation phase is needed with single or multicenter trials, and standardized approaches for imaging methodology and artificial intelligence algorithms. The multivariate of the technological solutions available both in the research centers and on the market poses serious questions on the variability of the results that can be generated by the software. A problem that certainly does not only regards the case of CT in COVID-19 patients, but that is extendable to all applications of artificial intelligence in diagnostic imaging.",
