            "text": "Background: Recent years have seen a rapid change in China's global engagement and a recognition that solving global challenges will need to take the changing role of China into account. The paper discusses China's growing involvement in global health. Health is an area where there is broad agreement over global priorities and, potentially, a fertile space to build new forms of collaboration that point the way towards the adaptation of global governance to a rapidly changing context. Results: Drawing on previous analyses of China's management of change in its domestic health reforms and interviews with a range of stakeholders in China, the UK and Switzerland, the paper argues that China's engagement in global health is developing and diversifying rapidly in response to the central government's desire to see a greater role for China in global health. This diversification is part of a pattern of change management familiar from China's domestic reform experience. Explorations underway by a range of Chinese agencies form part of a process of rapid experimentation and experiential learning that are informing China's search for (a) new global role(s). Conclusions: China is undergoing rapid institutional innovation and developing capacity for greater global engagement, including in health; however, substantial, recent leadership commitments make clear Chinese agencies' need for continued exploration, innovation and rapid learning. How China engages globally is of significance to the world, not just China. The challenge for China, other global actors and multilateral organisations is to incorporate new approaches into existing global governance arrangements, including for the management of global health. This will require a willingness on all sides to learn from each other and invest the effort needed to build governance arrangements appropriate for the coming decades. This is not only important as a means of protecting global public health, but also as a demonstration of how governance arrangements can be adapted to the needs of a pluralistic global order in a context of rapid change.",

Many of these challenges involve the negotiation of complex conflicts of interest and it is difficult, in a context of intensifying global economic competition, to imagine how countries will begin to resolve them. The case of health may be different because there is already a broad global consensus on aims, expressed in the sustainable development goal of universal health coverage and agreement on the importance of effective surveillance and response to disease outbreaks. The COVID-19 outbreak has made the need for global cooperation abundantly clear.",

The first is a series of analyses by this paper's authors of China's approach to the management of change in its own health system [1] [2] [3] [4] . The second is a review of documents and a number of interviews undertaken as part of an evaluation of the UK Department for International Development-funded China-UK Global Health Support Programme (GHSP). 1 These interviews provided a unique opportunity to gain an understanding of the perspectives of the leaders of China's rapidly expanding global health sector and of global health actors with whom they are engaging. Section 2 provides more information on the data collected. The paper argues that China is taking a similar approach to managing its changing engagement in global health as in its own health sector and that efforts to build cooperation need to take this into account.",

Despite persistent predictions of system collapse, the country has \"failed to fail\" [5] . It has experienced huge economic and industrial restructuring, changing from a poor and predominantly agrarian economy to a more diversified, higher-wage and increasingly consumption-based economy. Sustained growth of GDP, at around 10% per year between the early 1980s and early 2010s, has supported increases in welfare, including long-run increases in incomes and reductions in poverty of \"unprecedented \u2026 scope and scale\", contributing around 70% of global reduction of the number of people in extreme poverty between 1990 and 2013 [6] . China's achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, on poverty reduction and improvements in health was a major contributing factor to their achievement globally [7] . This success has led to a belief by Chinese policy-makers and researchers that their country's experience has major lessons for others [8, 9] . It has also fostered an optimistic willingness to engage in ambitious and rapid processes of global development and change. This optimism underlies the major international initiatives we describe in section 2.",

Limited accountability and sometimes insufficient regulation (or enforcement) remain problematic, including in the health system [6] .

This has led to an interest in China's management of change. Since the commencement of the transition from a command economy, government policy has been dominated by the over-riding imperatives of ensuring rapid economic development and avoiding major policy errors that could provoke social disorder. An important strategy for achieving these imperatives has been the encouragement of policy experimentation and innovation. A number of analyses have pointed to the importance of experimentation in testing novel policy solutions before large-scale adoption to learn about effectiveness and reduce the risk of unintended and deleterious outcomes [14, 15] . These approaches have helped China 'discover' and evolve appropriate institutions and policy approaches to underpin development [6, 16] .

As Dani Rodrik has phrased the question, \"We shall experiment, but how shall we learn?\" [22] . Historically, the Chinese polity has made use of a number of mechanisms to support intrasystemic learning, including government meeting cycles to continually review and adjust policies [23] , field visits and inspections, use of policy briefings and media to disseminate practices judged to be useful and to encourage mutual learning, rotation and secondment of government officials and so forth [3] . Research institutes and universities have played a significant role in this process, helping to uncover, assess and propagate potentially significant or useful practices from among the range of practices produced at times of rapid reform. As China has established increasingly complex institutional arrangements it has begun to formalize evaluation and learning processes, leading to a growing interest in contemporary monitoring and evaluation methods [24] . In the following section we argue that China is replicating this strategy for managing adaptation to rapid change as it substantially increases its capacity to become an effective partner in global development and global health.",

In addition, we interviewed people involved in Chinese pilot projects supported by the GHSP in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Myanmar and development partners in these countries. We also attended a number of GHSP-supported project design meetings, workshops, and formal meetings over the course of the programme. The interviews focused on the respondents' understandings of the policy priorities, activities undertaken and the lessons that have been learned concerning China's involvement in both international development and global health and international collaborations. The interviews were not recorded to encourage frankness and the notes were used in compiling the reports. A review of ethical issues was included in the inception phase of the evaluation.",

It also shows a number of new drivers (including soft power promotion and research and development collaboration) and innovations in approach (including linking of global and domestic developmental challenges, application of new technologies, and mobilization of ethnic Chinese identifies in linking with, for example, the Arab World). Reflecting substantial decentralisation in China's management of health and social welfare [48] , as well as the distributed nature of much of China's external engagement [49] , the activities profiled in the plan are a mixture of mandated, top-down initiatives and comparatively bottom-up initiatives developed by provinces or sub-national agencies in response to the overall direction of national strategy and policy. Equally, and in line with the transformation that China's overseas engagement is undergoing, multiple health-related agencies are developing their own strategies for overseas engagement related to their own areas of expertise. 6 This rapid increase in national commitment, and the proliferation of initiatives that is starting to become visible, have the following implications for global health:",

China has no template to guide this, but many agencies are actively exploring new roles. As can be seen from the linking of multiple kinds of activity such as assistance, research and development and commercial activity, China's role(s) is (are) unlikely to conform neatly to practices of existing donors and major global health agencies. Third, most Chinese agencies (including government and research agencies) have little experience of carrying out health interventions or collaborations overseas.

It is, necessarily, both a process of exploring new practical approaches (to health assistance, south-south collaboration, and so forth) as well as a process through which individuals and agencies build capacity and understanding of global health, and China'sand theirplace in it. The GHSP provided space for this kind of exploration, reimagining of China's global health engagement, and development of individual and institutional capacity.",

The roles and responsibilities of many government agencies are in flux as the government system undergoes rapid change and as China's international engagement changes gear. As during other periods of significant system reform in China, there will be a period of accommodation en route to a new stable configuration. The GHSP provided support to a leading Chinese university to coordinate analyses, in conjunction with the NHC, that would contribute to development of a global health strategy for that agency. The GHSP also supported a number of leading Chinese research institutes and universities to carry out analyses of a range of issues relating to China's global health engagement, and to translate much of this into policy briefings that were shared within the NHC and, to an extent, more widely. 8 The programme also supported courses on global health and global health governance for government officials and leaders in relevant research agencies implementing health programmes aimed at building capacity and creating links and shared perspectives between agencies. The GHSP also provided opportunities for exposure to a range of global and overseas health activities, including through a small number of secondments, visits to Chinese-supported overseas health pilot programmes, and dialogue with multilateral and UK agencies (principally DFID, through an annual dialogue). The consensus of the informants was that these activities were useful in starting to build an understanding of many aspects of global health, but that more will be needed to create capacity for substantial interventions in global health.",

Along with China's pivot towards greater engagement in global health, universities and research institutes are establishing centres for global health that will provide similar support for substantially increased engagement in global health. With funding from the GHSP, a number of universities and research institutes reviewed China's experience with several large-scale programmes, to control schistosomiasis and malaria, reduce maternal and child mortality, and the country's recent experience with large-scale health sector reform and produced publications for an international readership. Researchers from those institutions have been invited to provide expert advice to government agencies as demand increases for understanding of how China can create a new global health role. A number of networks focusing on global health are now emerging The Chinese Global Health Network, supported by the GHSP, provides a forum linking Chinese researchers, government agencies and third sector and private entities working on global health. To date there has not been a clear decision from Chinese research funding bodies regarding how China will finance research and technical support for global health. Much research continues to rely on ad hoc funding and funding from non-Chinese sources. Some new funding sources, such as the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund (SSCAF) could create opportunities for projects that will involve Chinese researchers in work on global health issues. The Chinese government has increasingly high expectations for China's overseas development engagement, and this will require broad capacity in research and policy support.",

A project completion review was carried out in 2019. Annual reviews and the project completion review can be found on the DFID website (link). 8 The GHSP supported the production of a large amount of research (more than 80 peer reviewed articles and book chapters in English and Chinese; DFID 2019), as well as more than 40 policy briefs (link). adapted to support the design and implementation of interventions in other countries. These interventions were led by Chinese health implementation agencies, including an affiliated agency of the Centres for Disease Control and university research centres. Chinese experts worked with partners in other countries to design and implement interventions that drew on Chinese experience. Visits by one of the authors to some pilot sites found that they provided an opportunity for several high-capacity Chinese institutions to develop interventions overseas, experiment with translating Chinese experience in new contexts and explore new kinds of assistance projects that China could support as it diversifies its health assistance. The pilots revealed many of the challenges that implementing agencies will need to address if China decides to establish its own capacity to undertake major health system strengthening and reform projects at scale. These included common problems that arise when working in another country. The signing of MOUs with multilateral organisations such as the WHO, and the establishment of new funding sources such as the SSCAF, show that the government is still exploring the appropriate balance between strengthening capacity within China to design, implement and evaluate major multi-country health system development programmes, collaborating with other bilateral agencies and working through multi-lateral organisations and global initiatives.",

The Chinese Government has also signed MOUs with the WHO and with several bilateral partners and is providing support to the Africa CDC. All these initiatives are still at an early stage. These experiences highlighted some constraints to translating agreements into substantial programmes of collaboration with bilateral and multi-lateral development organizations. One is the need to involve all relevant government departments such as International Development, Health, Commerce, Finance and Foreign Affairs. China and the UK are strengthening coordination at national level, however mechanisms to make this effective in bilateral cooperation are not firmly in place. This could be addressed by the identification of government focal points to manage bilateral cooperation on global health. A second constraint is the need to facilitate joint working between government administrative systems in China, bilateral partners and multi-lateral organizations. This will involve significant efforts by counterpart agencies involved in the funding and management of global health activities. A third constraint is the thinness of existing cooperation between China and international partners. This needs to involve health research organisations, agencies that manage international development programmes, private health sector companies and so forth. There are already examples of effective collaboration, however this needs to be deepened and mechanisms are needed for governments to mobilize this expertise in coordinated efforts to address public health challenges. This could involve the creation of a forum for global health collaboration.

Experimentation has played an important role in subsequent reforms to the economy, state, political and administrative structure, and society. This has enabled China to achieve rates of development that would have been considered by almost all experts to be impossible.
