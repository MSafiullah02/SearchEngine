They found that UAs could be used to accurately measure the distributions of three-dimensional airflow parameters. However, the UA sensor was too bulky for use in small areas. Cao et al. [7] performed a large-scale particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement to characterize the mixing air distributions inside a partially transparent airliner cabin mockup. They obtained high-accuracy 2-D airflow information and found that the cabin airflows were of low velocity and high turbulence level. Li et al. [8] measured the distributions of air velocity, temperature, and tracer-gas (sulfur hexafluoride or SF6) concentration in the economy-class cabin of an MD-82 airplane with gaspers on and off. The experimental results showed that gaspers in a cabin with mixing ventilation might not be useful for improving cabin air quality, even though the gaspers seemed to supply clean air directly to passengers.",

For instance, Zhang et al. [9] employed the RNG k-\u03b5 model to simulate the CO2 distribution in a section of a Boeing 767 airliner cabin. They found that the CO2 concentration with the mixing air distribution was fairly uniform, and the mixing air distribution system could spread infectious diseases. You et al. [10,11] developed a consolidated turbulence model and a simplified gasper geometry model in a CFD program for predicting the airflow and contaminant transport in a cabin with gaspers. The CFD program was then used to investigate the impact of the gaspers on contaminant transport in the economy-class cabins of Boeing 767 and 737 airliner. It was found that the statistical impact of the gaspers on passengers' exposure to contaminants was neutral. Hence, the gaspers did not improve the cabin environment.",

Meanwhile, displacement ventilation systems have been widely used in buildings and have been shown to be more effective than mixing ventilation systems in removing contaminants [12]. Therefore, to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious disease viruses and/or to improve cabin air quality, new ventilation systems have been developed further from the displacement ventilation system. Schmidt et al. [13] and M\u00fcller et al. [14] compared mixing ventilation displacement ventilation systems in a section of an A320 cabin mockup. Schmidt et al. [13] found that a mixing ventilation system had higher draft risk, while a displacement ventilation system could result in \u201chot heads.\u201d However, M\u00fcller et al. [14] suggested that a displacement ventilation system could maintain an acceptable cabin thermal environment as long as the temperature difference between the head and feet was kept in a comfortable range. Bosbach et al. [15] measured the air velocity and temperature in a single-aisle airliner cabin with mixing ventilation, displacement ventilation, and hybrid ventilation during stationary ground and flight tests in an A-320 airliner. The displacement ventilation system supplied air through the lower sidewalls of the cabin and exhausted the air near the cabin ceiling, while the hybrid ventilation was a combination of mixing and displacement ventilation. The researchers found that the mixing ventilation system had the lowest heat removal efficiency, indicating that mixing ventilation may not be efficient in controlling contaminant transport. The use of a displacement ventilation system in a cabin, meanwhile, may be efficient in controlling the contaminant transport but, it may result in poor thermal comfort.",

Individual diffusers installed on the floor under the seats would supply clean air to the passengers in the row behind, and the cabin air would be extracted at ceiling level. Such a system would not occupy much of the passengers' leg room, since the diffusers would be installed between passengers or at the ends of the rows. Clean air would first be supplied directly to the passengers, who generate heat. In the presence of thermal plumes, the air would then travel upward, carrying exhaled contaminants from the passengers to the exhausts. Therefore, the system could reduce airborne contaminant transport in comparison with traditional mixing ventilation. The passengers' feet would not be in front of the diffusers, and thus the system would not produce a draft that would jeopardize cabin thermal comfort. The system combines the advantages of under-floor air distribution and displacement ventilation.",

The thermocouples were also used to measure the temperature distribution in the passengers' leg area, but the measurement locations were again shifted forward by 0.15 m. To measure the contaminant concentration distribution, this experiment used a mixture of 1% SF6 and 99% N2 as a tracer gas. The mixture was injected at the mouth of the manikin seated at 4D (see Fig. 2(b) for location) at a rate of 70 L/h. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the SF6 concentration was sampled in front of each passenger and in the middle of the cabin at heights of 0.1, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.45, 1.7, and 2 m above the cabin floor and at the cabin exhaust. Thus, there were a total of 41 sampling points, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The SF6 concentration was measured by a photoacoustic gas analyzer (INNOVA model 1314). The sampling time required for one data point was 45 s, and data was recorded for at least 10 min at each sampling point.",

Because of the approximations used in CFD, it was necessary to validate the computer simulations with the experimental data obtained in the previous section before the software program could be used for ventilation system optimization. We used a hybrid turbulence model proposed by You et al. [11] to calculate the air distribution in airliner cabins. Among all Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, the RNG k-\u03b5 model is the most robust in calculating the bulk air regions for enclosed environments [[16], [17], [18], [19]], and the SST k-\u03c9 model is superior in the near-wall regions [11]. To take advantage of both models, this hybrid model uses the standard k-\u03c9 model in the near-wall region and a transformed RNG k-\u03b5 model in the bulk air region.",

The upward flow was maintained in this region because the air was directed obliquely upward from the supply diffusers and because of the thermal plumes generated by the manikins.

The reason for this difference may be that the UA system measured average velocity over a span of 3 cm in each direction, as determined by the dimensions of the UA sensor, whereas the PIV system captured the data at a specific point. Since the airflow in the cabin was extremely complex, such a difference between UA and PIV might result in the discrepancy of the measured data.

Therefore, the proposed ventilation system would provide an acceptable thermal environment in an airliner cabin. However, the temperature distribution in the occupied zone would not be as uniform as that generated by a mixing ventilation system. Furthermore, the temperature profile in CS4 was not symmetric, possibly because of slight differences in thermo-fluid and geometric conditions. In fact, the asymmetric distribution was stable. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the temperature in the area corresponding to the diffusers was lower than that in the surrounding environment.

The contaminant removal efficiency indicates the percentage of exhaled contaminant that is prevented from traveling to the front or back rows. The higher the efficiency, the lower the contaminant concentration level will be in the front and back rows. Therefore, this investigation aimed to minimize the dimensionless exposure for passengers, and maximize the contaminant removal efficiency. Note that this parameter might not be able to fully characterize the longitudinal contaminant transport. More efforts will be made to systematically investigate the contaminant transport between rows in an aircraft cabin with the proposed ventilation system.",

The air velocity, air temperature, and contaminant distributions in the mockup were measured. It demonstrated good contaminant removal potential and acceptable thermal comfort. Despite the fact that the diffusers in the proposed system were close to the passengers' legs, the air velocity magnitude was small in the leg area and therefore would not create a draft. However, if a passenger placed his/her legs directly in front of the diffuser, he/she might feel cold.\u2022This study also conducted CFD simulation of the air distributions in the mockup, and the experimental data was used to validate the CFD results. The accuracy of the CFD simulation was acceptable for designing the cabin airflow.\u2022The study found the exhaust location to be a crucial design parameter for contaminant removal in airliner cabins with the proposed system. The validated CFD program was used to evaluate the location and number of exhausts in a one-row section of a fully occupied Boeing 737 cabin.
