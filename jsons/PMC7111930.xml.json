            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is one of the most common causes for epidemic viral encephalitis in humans and animals (Solomon, 2003, Tsai, 2000). Its genome encodes a single polyprotein composed of three structural proteins [core, membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E)] and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The mature viral proteins are produced via proteolytic processing of the single polyprotein by viral serine protease (NS2B-NS3) and cellular proteases (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001, Lindenbach and Rice, 2003). The viral replication is initiated by the replication complex through a process of RNA-dependent RNA polymerization in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Westaway et al., 2003). Nonstructural proteins 3 and 5 are components of the replication complex, which associates with the 3\u2032 noncoding region of genomic RNA to initiate viral replication (Chen et al., 1997, Edward and Takegami, 1993). NS5, the largest and most conserved viral protein, contains methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. The MTase is involved in methylation of the 5\u2032-cap structure of genomic RNA, while RdRp is important for viral genome replication (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001, Egloff et al., 2002, Guyatt et al., 2001, Koonin, 1993). Until now there is no specific and effective treatment available for Japanese encephalitis virus infection; vaccination is the only effective control measure. Although vaccination is widely used, some public health concerns exist (Takahashi et al., 2000).",

DDX3(X), identified in 1997, is a member of the DEAD (Asp\u2013Glu\u2013Ala\u2013Asp)-box helicase family (Park et al., 1998). It is ubiquitously expressed in a wide range of tissues (Kim et al., 2001). DDX3 has orthologous candidates in many eukaryotic organisms from yeast and plants to animals; they share significant identities between each other (Garbelli et al., 2011). DDX3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein characterized by nine conserved motifs. It displays RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities (Rocak and Linder, 2004, Schr\u00f6der, 2010).",

The other cellular helicases such as DDX1, DDX5, DHX15, DDX28, DDX56 and DDX42 are the cofactors for the replication of HIV, coronavirus, hepatitis B virus, HCV, JEV and WNV (Ariumi et al., 2007, Fang et al., 2005, Fang et al., 2004, Li et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2009, Xu et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2011, Xu and Hobman, 2012).

BHK-21 cells were first transfected with DDX3 shRNA plasmid to decrease the endogenous DDX3 expression level. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with RNA interference-resistant plasmid (to exclude the influence of DDX3 shRNA plasmid) pCDNA3.1-DDX3r-HA, pCDNA3.1-DDX3r-K230E-HA or pCDNA3.1-DDX3r \u2013S382L-HA before the cells were infected with JEV (MOI=0.01).

We synthesized Cmp6 to further confirm whether DDX3 helicase activity is critical for JEV infection. We infected BHK-21 cells with JEV virus (MOI=0.01) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h before Cmp6 was added (0\u201350 \u03bcM). The plaque formation assay at 48 hpi showed that Cmp6 significantly inhibited JEV replication by 20-fold at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM (\nFig. 4A). The Q-PCR also confirmed the results (Fig. 4B), and the results were consistent with the DDX3 helicase-dead mutants experiment. Meanwhile, we confirmed that Cmp6 did not stimulate significant cytotoxicity in BHK-21 cells at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM, while significant cytotoxicity was detected at the concentration of 100 or 200 \u03bcM by LDH assay (Fig. 4C).

We first infected the BHK-21 cells with JEV (MOI=0.01). 48 h later, the anti-DDX3 polyclonal antibody was used to co-immunoprecipitate the proteins from the whole cell lysate. The results showed JEV NS3 and NS5 proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated by the endogenous DDX3 (Fig. 5C). Since DDX3 is a nucleic acid-binding protein, it is possible that the interactions might be mediated by RNA or DNA, and then we determined the interactions between DDX3 and viral proteins in the presence of RNase (100 \u03bcg/ml) and DNase (100 \u03bcg/ml). Western blot analysis showed that the interaction between DDX3 and JEV NS3 or NS5 proteins was not mediated by RNA or DNA (Fig. 5D).",

The cells were then transfected with in vitro-transcribed JEV replicon and firefly luciferase RNA was used as the internal control. The cells were harvested for dual luciferase assays at 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, and 72 h post transfection. The results showed that there were two peaks of replicon luciferase activity, which represented the first translation and the second replication peak. In DDX3 knockdown cells, lower luciferase activities were observed for all of the time points in both peaks (Fig. 7B), indicating that viral protein translation and viral RNA replication were all hampered by the knockdown of DDX3.",

However, the luciferase activities derived from a control reporter, Renilla luciferase flanked by cellular GAPDH 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs were not significantly changed (Fig. 7D).

            "text": "The prevalence of the disease caused by JEV and the limited efficacy of therapies stimulate the search for safer and more effective antiviral agents against JEV infection. Recently, new compounds have been discovered to inhibit JEV replication by targeting the virus (Chen et al., 1997, Chien et al., 2008, Deas et al., 2005, Ishag et al., 2013a, Ishag et al., 2013b, Lee et al., 2011, Li et al., 2012, Nawa et al., 2003, Ray and Shi, 2006, Yoo et al., 2009). However, the virus resistance to these kinds of inhibitors has been a problem. One possible solution to overcome virus resistance mutations is to target host cellular factors (Garbelli et al., 2011). Theoretically, a drug targeting the cellular factors important for the viral life cycle can be used to inhibit the viral infection (Kwong et al., 2005). Various host proteins are known to interact with DDX3, such as several translation initiation factors, transcription factor SP1, spliced mRNA in an exon junction complex, mRNP complex, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins (CRM1 and TAP) (Garbelli et al., 2011, Lai et al., 2008, Schr\u00f6der, 2010, Yennamalli et al., 2009) and eIF4E(Shih et al., 2007). Several viral proteins have also been reported to interact with DDX3, including hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, hepatitis C virus core protein, vaccinia virus K7, HIV-1 and poxviruses proteins (Angus et al., 2010, Ariumi et al., 2007, Mamiya and Worman, 1999, Owsianka and Patel, 1999, Schr\u00f6der, 2010, Sun et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2009, Wang and Ryu, 2010). Given that DDX3 is required for replication of HBV, HCV, HIV and poxviruses, it can be suggested that it is a promising target for drug development against these viruses that pose major global health threats (Garbelli et al., 2011, Kwong et al., 2005).",

The minus-strand RNA synthesis requires the presence of both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR (You et al., 2001), and genomic RNA cyclization mediated by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032\u2013UTR is essential for viral replication in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses (Fan et al., 2011, Ivanyi-Nagy and Darlix, 2012). DDX3 also has been reported to be involved in translation initiation (Geissler et al., 2012) and DDX3 can promote HIV proteins translation by binding to viral 5\u2032 UTR. It is most likely that DDX3 destabilizes the RNA structure locally to form a region large enough to allow the recognition of the m7GTP cap or loading onto the 40S subunit to initiate protein translation (Soto-Rifo et al., 2012). A recently published paper suggests that HCV 3\u2032 UTR retains ribosome complexes during translation termination to facilitate efficient initiation of subsequent rounds of translation (Bai et al., 2013). Our JEV replicon experiment confirmed that DDX3 positively regulates JEV protein translation.",

The Renilla luciferase gene was inserted after the first 102 bp of the JEV C gene, followed by the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A self-cleaving protease (FMDV-2A) to enable the cleavage of the luciferase away from downstream nonstructural proteins (Lo et al., 2003, Varnavski and Khromykh, 1999). FMDV 2A was fused to the last 90 bp of the E gene that is necessary for the proper topology of the following viral proteins. To ensure RNA stability and processing, a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme was placed immediately adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the JEV cDNA followed by a bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation sequence. The JEV-replication-deficient replicon was constructed by introducing a mutation (GDD\u2192AAG) in NS5 gene (Blight et al., 2003) using Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the specific primers.
