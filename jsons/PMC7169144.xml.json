Deficiencies in melatonin production or melatonin receptor expression and decreases in melatonin levels (such as those that occur during aging) are likely to contribute to numerous dysfunctions 14, 15, 16. In fact, several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is efficient in preventing cell damage under acute (sepsis, asphyxia in newborns) and chronic states (metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, inflammation, aging) 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. In humans, the efficacy of melatonin as a treatment of ocular diseases, cardiovascular diseases, sleep disturbances and several other pathologies, as well as a complementary treatment in anesthesia, haemodialysis, in vitro fertilization and neonatal care, has been assessed and reported to be beneficial 23. Likewise, melatonin reduces the toxicity and increases the efficacy of a large number of drugs whose side effects are well documented 24.",

Enzymes involved in the elimination of free radicals include the superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).

During this early phase, activated NK cells release IFN\u2010\u03b3, which is not stimulated by viral PAMPs but by IL\u201012 and IL\u201018 released by activated macrophages 126. All of the cellular components of the innate immune system can participate in the antiviral response by killing infected cells, by producing chemokines (including eotaxin, RANTES, MCP\u20101, IL\u20108) that recruit inflammatory cells into the infected tissue and by producing antiviral and immunoregulatory cytokines (including TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101, IL\u20103, IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, IL\u201018, GM\u2010CSF) that enable the adaptive immune response to recognize infected cells and perform antiviral effector functions 127, 128, 129, 130. Lymphocytes are cells of this adaptive immune system. Among them, two subsets of CD4+ T cells, Th1 and Th2, play a key role in antiviral immunity. After being stimulated by antigen presenting cells, Th1 cells produce IL\u20102, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3, which possess antiviral activities and regulate activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, whereas Th2 cells produce IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u201010 and IL\u201013, which stimulate B cells to produce antibodies 131. Despite the fact that virus\u2010specific Th2 cells can be detected following primary infection by any virus, virus\u2010specific Th1 cells are usually much more abundant and reach very high numbers at the peak of the acute infection 132.

Melatonin is known to activate both innate and adaptive immune responses leading to an increase in immune responsiveness and regulation of several immune functions 27, 28, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143. Melatonin has properties as an inflammatory regulator, because it differentially modulates pro\u2010inflammatory enzymes, and controls the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and leukotrienes. The timing of its pro\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010inflammatory effects suggests that melatonin might promote early phases of inflammation, on the one hand, and contribute to its attenuation on the other hand, to avoid complications of chronic inflammation 144. Melatonin enhances the production of IL\u20101, IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u201012 from the monocytes 145 and of IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20106 from cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 137. It has been suggested that melatonin and IFN\u2010\u03b3 create an immunoregulatory circuit responsible for the antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory actions of IFN\u2010\u03b3 146. This cytokine increases serotonin and melatonin levels in lymphocytes and macrophages. The early stimulation in the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 by melatonin suggests that earlier treatment with this indoleamine could increase the antiviral activity of IFN\u2010\u03b3 147. In addition to stimulating the production of several cytokines that regulate immune function, melatonin enhances immune function by directly stimulating polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, NK cells and lymphocytes 148. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the fact that melatonin treatment has been found to augment CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes of rats 149. Consequently, melatonin is considered an immunoenhancing agent 141, 150.",

Nevertheless, the average mortality obtained during neutralization experiments with the corresponding anticytokine antibody suggests that although neither TNF\u2010\u03b1 nor IFN\u2010\u03b3 is essential for the protective effect of melatonin observed in murine VEEV infection, IL\u20101\u03b2 induced by melatonin treatment is a target cytokine to promote the immune enhanced state. This in turn causes the viral clearance or helps generate an earlier immune response against the VEEV infection 160. In contrast, in the brain of VEEV\u2010infected mice, melatonin stimulates the endogenous production of IL\u20101\u03b2 but reduces the concentration of TNF\u2010\u03b1 158. IL\u20101\u03b2 is considered one of the earliest host mediators during infectious diseases of the CNS and its role in infectious processes of the brain parallels its role in the peripheral immune system 160. Although IL\u20101\u03b2 deficiency is protective against fatal Sindbis virus infection 161, mice deficient in IL\u20101\u03b2 have increased susceptibility to influenza virus 162. In poxvirus animal models, the viral induction of this cytokine is also beneficial for the host 163. The increase in IL\u20101\u03b2 levels detected in blood and in brain of VEEV\u2010infected mice after melatonin treatment also plays a protective role, possibly by neuronal support and protection by inducing nerve growth factor secretion by astrocytes 164.
