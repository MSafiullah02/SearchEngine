The significant role of bacterial co-infection in past pandemics, and in seasonal influenza, has been documented. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, the organisms most frequently recovered from the sputum, lung and blood of infected patients were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. 2, 5 In most cases, lung samples taken from patients dying during the 1918-1919 pandemic demonstrate bacteriologic and histopathologic evidence of severe acute bacterial pneumonia. 5 During the Asian and Hong Kong influenza pandemics of 1957 and 1968, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. aureus were most frequently isolated from patients with bacterial pneumonia. 3, 4, 6, 7 In 1957, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were isolated from 59% and 15% of lung cultures, respectively. 3 Most deaths from S. aureus were observed in adolescents and young adults. In 1968, much of the excess mortality was attributed to the increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia: a threefold increase in the incidence of staphylococcal pneumonias and strong correlation between staphylococcal pneumonia and prior influenza infection was observed. 7 During the 2009 influenza pandemic, initial clinical descriptions reported a severe respiratory illness with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 8 Co-detection of clinically relevant bacteria with influenza A \u2044 H1N109 was infrequent, yet 31% of patients admitted to ICU had a clinical diagnosis of sepsis and 95% received antibiotics. 9 Bacterial co-infection was documented using histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular evidence in 22 of 77 (28AE6%) subjects with fatal pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N1 2009 infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus were the predominant bacterial pathogens detected. 10 Despite numerous studies examining co-infection in pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N109, many questions remain. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Many published studies have limited number of critically ill patients enrolled, 11, 14, 15 have not enrolled all age groups, 12, 13, 15 have not examined the role of co-infecting respiratory viruses 10, 12, 13, 15 and have not explored important risk factors such as obesity in those with and without coinfection. 11, 12, 15 Our objectives were (i) to determine the burden of bacterial and viral co-infections in adults and children admitted to ICUs in Australia during the first wave of the A \u2044 H1N109 pandemic (1 June-31 August 2009) using traditional and molecular techniques and (ii) to explore risk factors for and outcomes of those in whom bacteria and other viruses were detected concurrently with A \u2044 H1N109.",

This rate is comparable to that observed in other ICU studies. Martin-Loeches et al. 13 identified bacterial co-infection in 113 \u2044 645 adults (17AE5%) admitted with confirmed pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N109. Estenssoro et al. 12 identified coexisting bacterial pneumonia in 80 \u2044 325 adults (25%) requiring ventilation with suspected, probable or confirmed pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N109 infection. A similar rate of bacterial co-infection was observed in pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N109 fatalities (18AE3-29AE0%), 10, 22 significantly more than that observed when all hospitalised children and adults are examined (bacterial co-infection <5%). 9, 23, 24 In our group, viral co-infection was infrequent and had little impact on morbidity and mortality. This is, to our knowledge, the largest study to examine both the burden What is the impact of bacterial co-infection? Data from this and previously published studies are conflicting. Estenssoro et al. demonstrated that S. pneumoniae co-infection was an independent predictor of hospital mortality yet this study and that by Martin-Loeches et al. failed to identify any significant difference between co-infection and ICU mortality. 12, 13 Martin-Loesches et al. 13 found that coinfected patients were older and had higher APACHE scores, yet no differences in co-morbidities were noted. Our data demonstrate that those with co-infection were younger and had fewer co-morbidities normally associated with an increased need for ICU admission. This association was particularly strong for obesity. The significance of this finding was preserved if children were included or excluded from the analysis. Martin-Loesches et al. demonstrated that subjects with bacterial co-infection were more likely to require invasive ventilation and vasopressors. This was not demonstrated in this study. Despite the failure to identify differences in the severity of illness in subjects with and without co-infection, it is still possible that co-infection was a contributory factor to severe disease. As enrolment in this study required severe influenza requiring ICU admission, it is possible that co-infection was the precipitant that led to ICU admission in younger people without co-morbidities. To explore this hypothesis further, a clinically well-characterised control group not requiring ICU admission would be required.",

Staphylococcus aureus was the major pathogen identified in more than 40% of co-infected patients and 9AE6-14AE0% of all patients. All subjects with staphylococcal co-infection in our study had community-acquired infection. Similar rates of co-morbidities were observed in patients with S. aureus co-infection compared with patients co-infected with other organisms. Methicillin resistant S. aureus was identified in only 35% of cases. These findings are in contrast to other studies where S. pneumoniae was the major cause of bacterial co-infection. 10, 13, 22 Despite extensive investigations including pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in addition to respiratory cultures, blood cultures and nucleic acid detection, pneumococcal co-infection was detected in \u00a328% of co-infected patients and 5AE7-7AE5% of all patients. It is, however, possible that this is underestimated because of the frequent use of empiric antibiotics including ceftriaxone (which has excellent anti-streptococcal activity but is associated with increased incidence of S. aureus 25 ) in patients admitted to ICU with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), viral pneumonitis or ARDS and failure to perform cultureindependent diagnostic tests (e.g. pneumococcal urinary antigen) on all patients. Staphylococcus aureus complicating influenza infection has been well described in previous pandemics. 3, 6, 26 These findings have a significant impact on both management and prevention of complications in severe influenza infection.",

            "text": "The present study has several potential limitations. Despite a uniform approach to diagnosis of CAP, a pathogen is identified in <50% of cases. 31 The observational nature of this study means that the diagnostic approach varied between different patients and ICUs. These limitations Co-infection in severe influenza \u00aa 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd existing in other comparable studies. 12, 13 Adequate lower respiratory specimens and samples for culture-independent laboratory tests (e.g. pneumococcal urinary antigen) were not routinely submitted for microbiological analysis. In addition, it is likely that many subjects were administered antibiotics prior to specimen collection. It is therefore possible that the true burden of bacterial and viral co-infection is underestimated. Despite the use of quantitative and \u2044 or semiquantitative laboratory methods, co-infecting and colonising bacteria remain difficult to differentiate. We have attempted to overcome this by further analysing lower respiratory tract specimens using quantitative nucleic acid amplification techniques, a test not routinely used for the diagnosis of CAP. This approach was hampered by limited lower respiratory sampling in the 14 ICUs enrolling subjects. It is possible, however, that the detection of bacteria colonising the lower respiratory tract at high concentrations may falsely elevate the observed rate of bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that delays in processing samples led to nucleic acid degradation. Furthermore, viral co-infection may have been underestimated as emerging viral pathogens, such as human bocavirus and coronaviruses, were not tested for. Upper respiratory tract samples were most frequently examined for viral pathogens. Additional pathogens may have been detected if upper and lower respiratory samples were available for analysis on all patients. 32 Radiology data and timing of antibiotic administration data were not collected in the study. It is probable that the burden of co-infection would be higher in subjects with radiologically confirmed pneumonia and those examined prior to receipt of antibiotics.",

Co-infection had little impact on severity of illness or outcome in those admitted to intensive care but may have contributed to the need for ICU admission in those without other risk factors. Empiric parenteral antibiotics with anti-staphylococcal activity should be strongly considered in those with severe influenza infection. To estimate the true burden and impact of bacterial and viral co-infection, a prospective study with uniform sampling using both culture and molecular assays is required. Further development of new diagnostic methods is urgently required, particularly to assist with diagnosing bacterial pneumonia.",
