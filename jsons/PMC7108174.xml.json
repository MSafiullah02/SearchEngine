Microseal\u2122 96-well skirted V-bottom polypropylene microplates (MJ Research) were used for PCR amplifications and all plate-based purifications. Cellular DNA samples from the whole blood of anonymous donors were purified by standard methods (Puregene; Gentra Systems). DNA concentrations were between 200 and 300 mg/L. Twelve of the 24 samples contained 1 of 7 pathogenic variants at various levels of heteroplasmy: A3243G, T3271C, A8344G, T8356C, T8993G, T8993C, and G11778A. Twelve other samples with no mutation at these sites were used as controls. The genotype of each sample was blinded before MS analysis. Results were compared with those obtained by conventional PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis (14)(15). The overall flow of operations for variant detection by ESI MS is illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "A set of 444 human mitochondrial genomes were obtained from GenBank and aligned against the Cambridge reference sequence (16)(17) represented in Fig. 2 . An additional set of 524 human mitochondrial sequences containing only the sequence of the noncontrol region (coordinates 577\u201316023) was obtained from MitoKor, Inc. (18). For this study, we designed 4 primer pairs to amplify mtDNA regions that contained 7 point variants associated with mitochondrial and/or metabolic diseases (Fig. 2 ; see Table 1 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of this article at http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol53/issue2). An additional 9 primer pairs were designed to amplify mtDNA surrounding other common pathogenic mtDNA variants located in tRNA genes (Fig. 2 ; see Table 1 in the online Data Supplement). For each of the 13 primer pairs, we created a database of theoretical PCR products and their molecular masses, based on the 968 human mtDNA sequences in the alignment and assessed the frequency of each expected PCR product (see Table 1 in the online Data Supplement). The frequency of occurrence of each base composition was defined as the frequency that each expected base composition occurred over the set of 968 sequences in the database. For one region (tRNA-Phe, primer pair 1; see Table 1 in the online Data Supplement), the amplified region contained 15 bases 5\u2032 of the first sequenced base represented in the MitoKor sequence set. For this reason, expected base-composition frequencies for tRNA-Phe were based on only the 444 mtDNA genomes from GenBank. Because human mtDNA outside of the hypervariable D-loop regions is highly conserved (19), usually only a very small number of variants occur within any given PCR product. The frequency of the most common base composition in the database of 968 sequences was >90% for all regions except tRNA-Leu-2.2 (primer pair 13, amplification coordinates 12294\u201312321; see Table 1 in the online Data Supplement). We devised an assay amenable to high-throughput automation that screened for heteroplasmic base-composition states consistent with 1 or more mtDNA variants relative to the most common expected PCR product for each PCR primer pair.",

Total cellular DNA from each sample (1\u20131.5 ng) was used as the template in the PCR. Primer pair sequences are shown in Table 1 of the online Data Supplement. We used a \u201ctouch down\u201d thermal-cycling approach in the PCR protocol. The cycling conditions consisted of (1), an initial denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by (2), denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, (3), annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 20 s, and (4), elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. Steps 2\u20134 were repeated for 29 cycles, with the annealing temperature decreasing 1 \u00b0C with each cycle until the annealing temperature reached 55 \u00b0C. The final step was elongation at 72 \u00b0C for an additional 4 min. Thermal-cycling parameter values were identical for the variant-targeted primer pairs (see Table 2 in the online Data Supplement) except that the annealing temperature was fixed at 53 \u00b0C, and 35 cycles were carried out. An MJ Dyad thermocycler (MJ Research) was used for all PCR experiments.",

This step must precede ESI MS analysis because PCR salts and buffer components have a deleterious effect on the ESI process. Even small amounts of salts (<1 \u03bcmol/L) will significantly reduce ESI sensitivity, owing to the appearance of multiple cation adducts in the mass spectra. The protocol is based on the weak anion-exchange method, in which amplified DNA is bound to a weak anion-exchange resin; unconsumed deoxynucleoside triphosphates, salts, and other low\u2013molecular-weight species that could interfere with subsequent ESI MS analysis are removed by rinsing the resin with a solution of 40 mmol/L NH4HCO3 and 200 mL/L methanol. Rinsing the resin with 25 \u03bcL of 1 mol/L NH4OH eluted the final purified and desalted amplicons. The final electrospray buffer contained 250 mL/L methanol and 25 mmol/L piperidine/imidazole (21). Purification was carried out in an automated and parallel format. A single 96-well plate of PCR products can be desalted in <30 min.",

            "text": "We used a modified Bruker Daltonics Apex II 70e actively shielded ESI-FTICR MS instrument in negative-ionization mode. We used a 600-MHz Pentium II data station running XMASS software (version 7.0.4; Bruker Daltonics) under a Windows NT 4.0 operating system (Microsoft) to control all aspects of pulse sequence and data collection. The FTICR data station triggered a CTC HTS PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies) to extract a 15-\u03bcL sample directly from the 96-well microtiter plate and inject it into a 10-\u03bcL sample loop integrated with a fluid-handling system that supplies sample to the ESI source at a flow rate of 100 \u03bcL/h (12). Application of an ESI source potential of \u22126000V generated a stable electrospray plume, and a countercurrent flow of dry nitrogen gas assisted in the desolvation process. Spectral acquisition was performed in continuous duty-cycle mode, whereby ions accumulated in an external hexapole reservoir concurrent with ion detection in the trapped-ion cell (22). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we coadded 32 scans for a total data-acquisition time of 74 s. We used custom processing software developed in-house to analyze the raw mass spectra. First, ICR2LS software (9)(12)(20) was used to deconvolute the FTICR spectra into monoisotopic neutral masses for all of the observed signals. From these high-precision monoisotopic mass measurements, we calculated base compositions for each amplicon pair (9)(12)(20).",

Of note is that the ESI-FTICR MS methodology correctly identified all 12 positive samples and all 12 negative samples with no false negatives and no false positives. For samples in which heteroplasmy was detected at a given locus, the extent of heteroplasmy was measured both by relative peak heights in the mass spectra and by conventional PCR-RFLP gel analysis.

            "text": "Although we performed these studies with a research-grade ESI-FTICR MS instrument, recent advances in ESI-TOF MS technology have led to the development of benchtop instruments that have the requisite sensitivity and mass accuracy to identify PCR amplicons. This capability is illustrated in Fig. 3 . We amplified sample 2 with primer pair tRNA-Phe, split the purified amplicon into 2 aliquots, and analyzed the aliquots by ESI-TOF MS or ESI-FTICR MS. The resulting spectra (Figs. 3A and 3B , respectively) illustrate some of the key differences in performance between the ESI-FTICR and ESI-TOF methods. The most striking difference is the presence of \u201cfine structure\u201d in the FTICR spectrum that is absent from the TOF spectrum. The constituent elements comprising the amplicon are not monoisotopic (e.g., 98.1% of the carbon atoms are 12C, and \u223c1.1% are 13C); there exists a naturally occurring isotope distribution (to which 14N/15N and 16O/18O also contribute). Species containing different numbers of \u201clight\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d isotopes differ in molecular mass by \u223c1 atomic mass unit. These small mass differences are resolved by the FTICR method (>100 000 full width at half maximum resolution; Fig. 3B ) but not by the TOF method (Fig. 3A ). The TOF spectrum reflects only the width of the isotopic envelope, not the individual isotopomers. The centroid of the unresolved isotope envelope in the TOF spectrum can still be used to derive an accurate mass measurement of the analyte, albeit not with the same mass accuracy as the FTICR method. The experimentally determined average molecular masses for the forward and reverse strands of the amplicon were 32 819.94 and 31 932.57 Da, respectively, from the FTICR measurement (Fig. 3B ) and 32 819.8 Da and 31 932.6 Da from the TOF measurement (Fig. 3A ). The average mass-measurement errors are 0.8 ppm and 4 ppm for the FTICR and TOF spectra, respectively. In general, mass-measurement errors of <20\u201325 ppm (on both strands) are required to yield an unambiguous base composition. In this example, the correct base composition (A19 G38 C12 T36) is derived from either the FTICR or TOF measurements. The closest base composition in mass (A50 G31 C19 T5) would require a mass-measurement error of >20 ppm on both strands, and the base composition is inconsistent with and significantly different from all database entries for this primer pair. Because the routinely obtained mass-measurement errors of the FTICR and TOF methods are, conservatively, 5 ppm and 15 ppm, respectively, the correct base composition is unambiguously determined on either platform. It is notable that the sensitivities of the FTICR and TOF platforms are comparable for this application. Given the high signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra in Fig. 3 , this result suggests that shorter acquisition intervals could be used to further enhance the throughput of the system. We are currently validating this benchtop ESI-TOF MS platform for high-throughput analysis of multiplexed PCR reactions to characterize the hypervariable mtDNA regions for forensics purposes.",

Furthermore, this approach allows the probing of relatively large regions of genome for the presence of substitutions, SNPs, insertions, and deletions that were not originally targeted. Because this broad-survey assay determines the base composition of a PCR product and not the sequence, it does not conclusively determine the exact position of specific mtDNA variants. The purpose of the assay method we have described is primarily to detect sequence variants and heteroplasmic states (the presence of 2 or more mitochondrial variants existing simultaneously within an individual), either of which may be associated with a metabolic disease. In the event that a sample is flagged as possibly having 1 or more characterized mutations, the sample can be further investigated via sequencing. Compared with traditional electrophoresis gel\u2013based methods such as PCR-RFLP, the ESI MS protocol has several advantages: (a) The ESI MS-based method can detect both expected and unexpected variants. In contrast, traditional PCR-RFLP methods can detect only expected (i.e., targeted) mutations. Traditional methods answer the question, \u201cIs this specific mutation present in the sample?\u201d The protocol based on ESI MS answers the question, \u201cWhich mutations are present in the sample?\u201d (b) The MS instrument is a universal detector. It can detect multiple mtDNA variants simultaneously, whereas PCR-RFLP methods require different restriction enzyme digestions for different mutations. (c) Data interpretation can be done in an automated and standardized format, which is difficult for traditional methods such as PCR-RFLP. (d) Finally, samples can be screened in a high-throughput mode.",

The time requirements for this method are as follows: PCR amplification, 1 h 40 min; post-PCR purification, 30 min per 96-well plate; MS analysis, 1\u20132.5 h per 96-well plate. The capability for performing all of these processes in high-throughput mode enables screening of large numbers of samples for both expected and unexpected variants and facilitates searches for associations between mtDNA variants and diseases. The ESI-MS method can be used as a rapid, low-cost tool to screen samples before the time-consuming and costly process of direct DNA sequencing. In most cases, knowing that a mutation or SNP is present in a region of interest (even when the exact coordinates of the mutation are not known), and knowing the type of nucleotide substitution (e.g., A\u2192T) are the key data for discriminating a typical patient sample from a sample with 1 or more abnormalities requiring additional investigation. Moreover, in the relatively rare instance when sequencing is required to determine the exact coordinates of a nucleotide substitution, prescreening by the ESI MS methods allow much smaller regions to be sequenced, because the mass measurement and base-composition analysis provide the approximate location of the SNP.",

In comparison, a PCR-RFLP method typically requires 2 days to analyze a batch of 12 DNA samples for 7 different mtDNA variants, and 24 samples for this variant set requires 4 days. The enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis steps required by the PCR-RFLP method are not easily automated; these steps thus create a bottleneck that limits the number of samples that can be analyzed simultaneously. ESI MS eliminates this bottleneck and avoids the extra costs of restriction enzymes, agarose gels, and toxic fluorescent dyes. Automated DNA sequencing cannot reliably detect heteroplasmy at levels of <30% (23), and several commercial facilities currently charge \u223c$20 for single-pass sequencing. Therefore, not only is direct DNA sequencing more expensive than ESI MS, mtDNA sequencing is not reliable for detecting <30% heteroplasmy.",
