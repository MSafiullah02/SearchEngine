            "text": "Host innate immunity plays a critical role in the early phase of infection. This first-line defense against pathogens is mediated by a variety of pattern-recognition molecules including collectins, toll-like receptors and ficolins as well as inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon or macrophages and natural killer cells. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is one of collectins circulating in the serum and synthesized by liver. It consists of collagenous domains and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD). The CRDs recognize sugars including d-mannose, N-acetylmannosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and l-fucose on the surface of many pathogens in a calcium-dependent manner [1]. Previous studies showed that MBL can bind to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Candida Albicans\n[2], HIV, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus, HSV, influenza virus [3], [4], [5], [6]. The binding of MBL to microorganisms is presumed to induce MBL conformational changes that allow the molecule to initiate viral neutralization or kill virus via opsonization or complement activation [7].",

            "text": "Influenza A virus, a segmented single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, belongs to orthomyxoviridae and is subtyped according to the antigenic properties of their envelope glycoproteins, HA and NA. Currently, 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes circulate in birds. Among them, only seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses circulate in human population [8]. Occasionally, some subtypes of avian influenza A virus can jump into human and cause diseases with a range of clinical symptoms and outcomes, such as conjunctivitis, mild upper respiratory tract disease, as well as severe pneumonia and death [9], [10], [11], [12]. Viral HA and NA assist virus binding, entry and releasing during infection cycle. Their potential N-linked glycosylation sites (NGS) can be glycosylated, which might allow their binding to host MBL. It has been found that the glycan at residue 165 in H3N2 HA was of high-mannose and MBL neutralized viral infectivity via it. Many lines of evidences have shown that the MBL plays an important role in fighting against seasonal flu [13], [14], [15]. However, little is known about the interactions between avian influenza virus and the innate molecules. Avian influenza H7N9 virus is novel to human population [16], [17], which contains the surface HA and NA genes from duck and wild-bird influenza viruses and internal genes from poultry H9N2 viruses. Unlike other H7 viruses that generally cause mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or influenza-like illness (except one fatal case infected with H7N7 in Netherlands in 2003), H7N9 virus usually results in severe pneumonia or respiratory failure in human. Here, we examined the interactions of MBL with avian influenza virus H7N9, H9N2 and human virus H3N2. Furthermore, we studied the molecule mechanisms for them by structure modeling.",

Incubation with increasing concentrations of rhMBL resulted in elevated levels of MBL bound to immobilized influenza virus, reaching a plateau at 3 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 1\nA). Then, 3 \u03bcg/mL rhMBL was used to determine the affinity to increasing amounts of virus, revealing the virus-dose dependent binding feature (Fig. 1B). High binding of rhMBL to the human H3N2 virus might be due to a relatively more NGS in its HA and NA (Table S2), in addition to the glycans attached at the site of 165 as previously reported [14]. Beyond our expectation, H7N9 virus exhibited stronger binding than H9N2 virus, reaching a comparable level as human H3N2 at higher titers of 2 \u00d7 104 and 2 \u00d7 105, although fewer NGS was observed in avian H7N9 than avian H9N2 (Table S2). The differential binding of rhMBL to avian virus might result from the types of oligosaccharide attached and further investigations are needed. The finding demonstrated here implied a possible antiviral effect initiated by rhMBL at early stage of novel avian virus infection since na\u00efve host lacked the pre-existed cross-reactive or specific anti-HA or anti-NA antibodies.",

            "text": "RBD in HA, including the motifs of 190-helix, 130- and 220-loop, is one of important functional domains [25]. NA activity region is composed of 8 functional residues (R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371 and Y406) and 11 framework residues (E119, R156, W178, S179, D198, I222, E227, H274, E277, N294 and E425) [18]. To elucidate a possible interference between MBL and the NGS around the functional motifs: RBD in HA or the NA activity domain, we compared NGS distribution in them by structure modeling (Fig. S1). We also obtained the trimer form of MBL using the crystal structure (PDB code: 1HUP) and measured the radius of MBL CRD which is at least 30 \u00c5. Although there are indications that trimers of MBL are not biologically active and at least a tetramer form is needed for activation of complement [26], 30 \u00c5 can be regard as the minimum value. We subsequently calculated the average distances between the NGS located around RBD or NA activity region (Table 1) and speculated that their distance within the size of human MBL CRD, 30 \u00c5, might affect the functions of HA or NA. As listed in Table S2 and Fig. S1, only one conserved NGS on HA head was detected at position 240 in the avian H7N9 while different pattern was found in H3 and H9 (63, 122, 126, 133, 144, 165, 246 for H3; 95,128,198 for H9). The distances of NGS located in H3 and H9 from its individual RBD all are within 30 \u00c5 while it is of 37.3 \u00c5 at 240NGS in H7N9. Furthermore, the NGS at residue 165, 246 [14], [27] were indeed associated with the sensitivity of human H3N2 virus to MBL and 144 for 2009pdm H1N1 [28]. Notably, additional NGS at Site 133 in HA emerged in some H7N9 strain (4 out of 269) and the effect of MBL on it needed further tests. Similarly, only three NGS at 86, 146 and 200 on NA head were found in H7N9 and additional sites including 239, 329 and 402 in H3N2 and 239 and 402 in H9N2. Even the distances of NGS in H7N9 NA were less than 30 \u00c5, we could not detect any NAI effect of MBL on it. The findings might attribute to the absence of effective NGS adjacent to NA functional region, such as 239 and 402 in both H3N2 and H9N2 virus, or different glycan type attached.",

In contrast, for NAI on H7N9 virus, the rhMBL showed little effect even at a high concentration as 10 \u03bcg/mL. As MBL is supposed to display a steric interference with HA or NA when binding to the specific hexose sugars across or adjacent to RBD in HA or activity region in NA, the limited impact of MBL on H7N9 might result from its property of few NGS adjacent to functional region on the HA and NA. Of note, a serial of pathotypings including higher virus load, excess chemokine/cytokine response and functional impairments of B and T cells have been observed in H7N9 infection cases, particularly in fatal cases [33], [34]. The aberrant inflammatory response in H7N9-infected animals could be reversed partially by anti-C5a, indicating a hyperactivated complement mediated [35]. Therefore, the strong MBL-H7N9 virus interaction whereas limited effects on viral HA-receptor binding or NA-mediated releasing, might amplify immune dysfunctions in vivo and confer clinical severity of H7N9 infection via activating complement pathway and further investigates are needed.",
