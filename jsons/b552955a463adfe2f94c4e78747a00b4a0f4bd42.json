Paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected from patients with respiratory illness presenting to healthcare centers in two refugee camps in Kenya. The specimens were tested for C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. as well as eight respiratory viruses. Atypical pathogens were detected in 5.5% of the specimens of which 54% were co-infected with at least one of the eight viruses tested. Patients positive for atypical bacteria co-infected with virus were significantly more likely to have severe acute respiratory illness than patients infected with only atypical bacteria (P = 0.04). While the percentage of atypical pathogens identified was lower than expected, we found a significant relationship between atypical bacterial-viral coinfection and severity of disease in this refugee population.",

However, serologic assays with paired serum samples are by nature retrospective, not practical for rapid diagnosis, and less sensitive than molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays have been developed to identify atypical bacteria, but systems have not been developed that use qPCR to detect atypical pathogens for diagnostic or surveillance purposes in refugee settings. We determined the presence of atypical bacterial etiologies diagnosed by qPCR in patients from two refugee camps in Kenya. As these camps are part of a viral respiratory disease surveillance system, we also assessed the rate of atypical bacterial and viral co-infection in this population.",

A prospective multicenter study using serology and PCR to follow hospitalized children showed that nearly half the cases of communityacquired acute bronchitis, wheezing, and pneumonia in this pediatric population were associated with M. pneumoniae and/or C. pneumoniae infections [12] ; they are also frequent causes of upper respiratory tract infections [2] . While Bii et al. demonstrated M. pneumoniae by PCR in one-third of pediatric patients diagnosed with pneumonia in a Nairobi hospital [8] , atypical pathogens circulated less frequently in the Kenyan refugee camps during our study period. The one patient with Legionella spp. (who survived) detected in our study is of interest, given the lack of documented Legionella spp. cases in Kenya [13] .",

Although patients with atypical bacteria only had significantly more symptoms than patients with atypical bacteria co-infected with viruses, a simple count of symptoms may not reflect severity of disease. Similarly, in a study of communityacquired pneumonia in hospitalized pediatric patients, Michelow et al. found children with bacterial and viral coinfections had the greatest degree of disease severity, although typical as well as atypical bacteria were included in this analysis [10] . In contrast, when we compared patients with multiple viral infections and single viral infections, illness category (ILI vs. SARI) did not differ significantly. The clinical significance of multiple respiratory viral infections has not been resolved in the literature; some studies suggest higher morbidity than single viral infections while others do not [9, [15] [16] [17] .",

First, while we tested for eight viruses, we did not include some common viruses, such as coronaviruses, in our testing; we also did not test for zoonotic pathogens that may cause atypical pneumonias or other bacteria that typically cause community-acquired pneumonias. Second, our sampling technique included only NP and OP swabs. While OP swabs are the preferred specimens of choice to test for M. pneumoniae by PCR, nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasal washes are recommended to test for C. pneumoniae by PCR [18] ; however, as our yield of C. pneumoniae was more than double that of M. pneumoniae, we feel that the NP swab was an adequate sampling technique for C. pneumoniae. In addition, the lack of a control group limits our interpretation of the positive results, as symptomless infection with either atypical bacteria or viruses is possible. Finally, the number of adults (n = 5) with atypical bacterial infection in this study was relatively small, accounting for just 4.4% of the patients, limiting generalizations primarily to the pediatric population.",

These findings may have implications for the choice of antimicrobial therapy when treating patients with clinical pneumonia in refugee camps in Kenya. Although routine testing for atypical agents is impractical in this setting, for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics or who are severely ill, covering for atypical pathogens may be warranted.",
