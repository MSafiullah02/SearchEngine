Several recent, observational, multicenter studies reported that approximately one third of critically ill patients received a blood transfusion at one time or another during their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (Table 1). Because of the frequent use of this intervention, it is important for the ICU physician to be aware of recent developments in this continuously evolving field of medicine. In this narrative review, we consider some key aspects of transfusion medicine in the ICU, focusing on aspects relevant to the critically ill patient, including prevalence and reasons for blood transfusion, epidemiology and etiology of anemia in these patients, pathophysiological considerations on tolerance to anemia, and efficacy of RBC transfusion. Safety concerns, including questions of RBC storage and leukoreduction, are then discussed, followed by a proposal for an integrated approach to transfusion decisions and a discussion on economic aspects and alternatives to blood transfusion.",

In an observational, multicenter, cohort study in Scotland, 25% of patients admitted to the ICU had a hemoglobin level < 9 g/dl [2]. Similar results were reported in the ABC study [3], in which 29% of patients had a hemoglobin concentration < 10 g/dl on admission. Even in nonbleeding ICU patients, hemoglobin levels tend to decrease early [3]. This decrease is more pronounced in septic than in nonseptic patients [4], at least in part because of their inflammatory response; more frequent blood sampling may also contribute.",

            "text": "Interestingly, anemia and the need to restore adequate oxygen delivery (DO2) are the most common indications for transfusion, rather than acute bleeding [3,5-10]. Anemia in the critically ill patient is a multifactorial phenomenon that has been compared to the so-called \"anemia of chronic illness\" [11]. Apart from evident causes of anemia, such as primary blood losses (e.g., trauma, surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding), multiple other etiologies contribute to its pathophysiology and often coexist in the same patient [11]. These include blood losses related to minor procedures or phlebotomy, and hemodilution secondary to fluid resuscitation. Some studies have suggested that blood sampling may average as much as 40 ml/day [3,4], but the amount of blood required may decrease with technological developments in analytic methods. Other mechanisms for anemia include an inflammatory response with blunted erythropoietin (EPO) production, abnormalities in iron metabolism, and altered proliferation and differentiation of medullar erythroid precursors [11]. As a consequence, RBC deformability is decreased [12], whereas RBC adherence to the endothelium is increased, especially in septic patients, potentially leading to microcirculatory impairment and tissue hypoxia [13].",

            "text": "Tolerance to anemia is highly dependent on the volume status of the patient, physiological reserve, and the dynamics of the anemia (for example, chronic, such as the anemia of sepsis, versus acute, such as hemorrhagic conditions). Normovolemic anemia is better tolerated than anemia in hypovolemic states (e.g., acute bleeding in trauma patients or surgery) in which cardiac output acutely decreases. In healthy subjects submitted to normovolemic hemodilution, cardiac output increases because of decreased blood viscosity (especially relevant in severe anemia) and increased adrenergic response, allowing tachycardia and increased myocardial contractility. Other phenomena include blood flow redistribution (to heart and brain) and an increased oxygen extraction ratio (reflected by a decrease in mixed venous saturation [SvO2]). These mechanisms allow healthy humans to tolerate severe degrees of normovolemic anemia [14,15], although side effects, such as arrhythmias or ST changes, can be observed in extreme cases [16,17]. The myocardium is the organ at risk in cases of acute anemia in which both tachycardia and increased ventricle contractility may increase myocardial oxygen demand. Because myocardial oxygen extraction is already almost maximal at rest, every increase in myocardial oxygen demand must be accompanied by increased coronary blood flow [18]. This can become problematic in patients with stenotic coronary arteries especially when tachycardia is present, which can decrease diastole-dependent left ventricle perfusion.",

Hence, blood transfusions can, theoretically at least, limit tissue hypoxia [13,25,26]. But does this really happen in clinical practice? It is obvious that RBC transfusions can be lifesaving in situations of acute severe anemia or in bleeding patients in whom RBC administration can increase both oxygen arterial content and cardiac output. However, in the absence of bleeding, the increase in hemoglobin concentration could very well be offset by a decrease in cardiac output because of the increase in blood viscosity associated with a decreased sympathetic response [27,28]. DO2 has been shown to increase following RBC transfusion in numerous studies [26], but not in all [29].",

Some studies reported that VO2 increased following RBC transfusion, whereas others did not [26], and variable effects have been reported on tissue perfusion as assessed by gastric mucosal pH or near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) [30]. The reasons for these contradictory results lie primarily in the degree of severity of hypoxia preceding the RBC transfusion [31], which influences the dependency of VO2 on DO2. Methodological problems (imprecision in determination of VO2, assessment of global VO2 instead of regional VO2, poor correlation between systemic oxygenation parameters, and oxygenation in the microcirculation [13]) also may contribute to these discrepancies [31].",

In a recent systematic review of 45 observational studies reporting the impact of transfusions on patient outcome (mortality, infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) in populations of trauma, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, acute coronary syndrome, and ICU patients, Marik and Corwin [32] identified RBC transfusion as an independent predictor of death (pooled odds ratio (OR) from 12 studies, 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-1.9), infectious complications (pooled OR from 9 studies, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2), and ARDS (pooled OR from 6 studies, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-3.3). In ICU patients, the three studies included in the review (ABC study [3], CRIT study [5], and a study by Gong et al.

In contrast, an extended Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that patients who received a transfusion in fact had a better survival, all factors being otherwise equal. An increased rate of transfused leukoreduced RBCs reported in this study (in which 76% of centers routinely used leukoreduced RBCs) could perhaps account for the differences between the earlier ABC study [3] (in which 46% of centers used leukodepleted blood most of the time) and the SOAP study [34].

For example, in a well-defined patient population, such as after cardiac surgery, patients who develop gastrointestinal bleeding and require a blood transfusion have a worse prognosis, which is not necessarily the result of the blood transfusion. It is of paramount importance that all risks factors are taken into account. Ruttinger et al. [52] illustrated this point very well.

These stored RBCs also have an increased tendency to adhere to endothelium and could promote vasoconstriction; the stored RBCs act as a \"sink\" for nitric oxide [58]. Some animal studies [13] have shown deleterious effects of old RBCs on the microcirculation (potentially leading to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction). A human study found an inverse correlation between the age of transfused RBCs and maximal change in gastric mucosal pH, but these findings were challenged in subsequent studies [59-61].",

A recent review of the literature [57] identified 24 studies that address the effects of RBC length of storage on clinical (mortality, infections, length of stay, length of mechanical ventilation) or physiological (microcirculation, gastric mucosal pH) endpoints. Some studies found associations between the age of transfused RBCs and poorer outcomes, whereas others did not. Overall, no clear detrimental effect of RBC age could be identified; however, definitive conclusions are difficult to obtain because of numerous statistical limitations and biases inherent to the study designs [51,62]. Several, large, randomized, controlled trials in adult ICU and cardiac surgery patients are currently ongoing to address the clinical relevance of RBC storage. In the multicenter, double-blind prospective ABLE (Age of Blood Evaluation) study [63], adult patients admitted to the ICU are randomly assigned to receive leukoreduced RBCs stored for less than 7 days or issued according to standard procedure (expected average storage time of 19 days). The primary endpoint of this study is 90-day all-cause mortality. The target number of patients is 2,510 (for an expected improvement in primary endpoint greater than 5%) with an anticipated completion date by April 2013. The Red Cell Storage Duration Study (RECESS) is a multicenter, randomized study in patients (age 12 years and older) who undergo complex cardiac surgery and are likely to require RBC transfusion [64]. Patients who need transfusion are randomized to receive RBCs stored for \u2264 10 days or \u2265 21 days. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) from baseline to day 7, with secondary outcomes including all-cause 28-day mortality. The target number of patients is 1,832, and the anticipated completion date is September 2013.",

Leukoreduction is a process in which WBCs are reduced in number through centrifugation or filtration [67]. This process allows removal of approximately 99.995% of WBCs, but several thousand leukocytes (0.005% of a 500 ml blood unit) may still be present in the processed blood [67]; hence, the word \"leukoreduction\" is better than \"deleukocytation.\" The beneficial effects of this process include decreased febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, decreased transmission of certain pathogens, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), parasites and prions [67], and possibly decreased lung injury, such as TRALI. Moreover, prestorage leukoreduction, in which WBC removal occurs before RBC storage, avoids the need for a leukodepletion filter during transfusion [67] (but a 170-200-\u03bcm filter still needs to be incorporated into the intravenous blood line).",

A clinical benefit of leukoreduction is still somewhat controversial, particularly in the critically ill patient where no randomized, controlled trial has been performed [70]. In a before-after study of 14,786 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, repair of hip fracture, or who required intensive care after surgery, there was a 1% decrease in mortality rate associated with the implementation of universal leukoreduction [71]. In a recent meta-analysis of nine RCTs involving 3,093 surgical patients, the use of leukoreduction significantly reduced the odds of postoperative infection (summary OR, 0.522; 95% CI, 0.332-0.821; p = 0.005) [72]. This observation had been suggested in a previous meta-analysis [73] but has been challenged by another recent meta-analysis [74]. Nevertheless, leukoreduction makes sense, and many countries have adopted it as routine, even though costs are elevated. In Europe, at the time of the SOAP study in 2002, 76% of centers reported using leukodepleted blood routinely [34], whereas an earlier study performed in the same countries reported lower rates [3].",

For example, a study in Canada evaluated the mean societal cost of one allogeneic RBC unit at 264.81 US$, twice the cost estimated 7 years earlier [86]. Generally, these reported values are probably underestimated, and some have calculated that the cost of blood to society could in fact be twofold higher [84].",

These include approaches to reduce blood losses, for example use of antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and techniques of cell salvage during surgery; also, the use of small volume sample tubes can limit the blood losses related to sampling for laboratory studies. In a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials [87], subcutaneous administration of recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) in critically ill patients was shown to be associated with decreased transfusion rates, but this was not associated with improved mortality (except possibly in a subgroup of trauma patients [88]). Concerns also have been raised about potentially increased rates of deep vein thrombosis [88]. The development of artificial oxygen carriers is under investigation, but these have their own problems [89]. Further research is needed to improve these alternative strategies.",
