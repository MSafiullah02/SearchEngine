            "text": "In industrialized countries, hospitals are the backbone of the health-care system. In Germany, 18 787 168 hospital treatments were conducted in 1 996 hospitals in 2013 [1]. Like in most countries, nearly half of the hospital beds are in public ownership with a growing number of privately owned hospitals [2]. The aim of the hospitals is to heal diseases, prevent deterioration of the patients, or alleviate disease symptoms through trained staff and adequate equipment. For that reason, hospitals are a relatively hazardous working environment for staff. But the complexity of providing medical care in a high-tech environment makes hospitals more crisis-prone than less complex industries [3]. Due to the rising incidence and impact of crises, the significance of crisis research has heightened in recent years [4]. However, there is still a lack of generally agreed definitions and typologies of crises [4, 5]. A crisis is \u201ca state differing from the normal state which has the potential to or already has incurred damage to persons and/or technical equipment\u201d [6]. Transferred to hospital management, a crisis is one or numerous critical situations which could not be handled by routine measures of quality management. A hospital crisis is regarded as an event or a series of events that may occur either suddenly or which may take some time to evolve. It results in a major, urgent problem with potentially severe consequences for the hospital, and it must be addressed immediately.",

A US nationwide survey that was using a sample of 939 hospitals illustrated that there are some opportunities for improvement in hospital crisis management [5]. The researchers demonstrated that hospitals in rural areas are less prepared for crises than hospitals in urban areas. Moreover, they noted that current standards and crises plans are papers that are commonly placed in the shelf when a crisis occurs and the implemented standards provide no guarantee or assurance that the crisis response will be adequate. In addition, they showed that no outcome measures exist to determine if a crisis plan will be followed or is effective. These findings are supported by the research of Rebmann et al. [9] who identified that US hospital staff is often not updated on crisis plan changes.",

Although there is a growing number of publications addressing crises und crisis-preparedness in hospitals [3\u20135, 7\u20139, 11\u201313], literature related to HR crises in hospitals is scarce: only a few publications deal with the topic of crisis impact on HR management in hospitals [10, 14]. A systematic review identified gaps in staff education for adequate crisis response and discovered that hospital crisis prevention plans are not well-implemented or standardized [15]. Another review underlines these findings, as well as the insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of methods to train staff in crisis response [14]. Also, the results from a survey of 663 hospital managers show that there is a lack of the provision of staff when a crisis occurs [9].",

Second, we want to identify causes for these HR crises as knowledge about the causes of crises can help to develop prevention strategies. Third, we want to empirically quantify the occurrence of these crises in the past and try to give information about the likelihood of occurrence in the future, as well as about their perceived dangerousness. This knowledge supports the selection of those crises, which are most important and should consequentially receive special attention in practice and research.",

During a break, all crises were written on cards, clustered, and transferred onto a pin board. Following the break, the crises were presented, and the participants received 10 red points to evaluate the crises. The participants had to assign these to a certain crisis, depending on how negatively they interpreted the impact of a particular crisis on a hospital and for which crisis they wished to be prepared for. Afterwards, the six crises, which had received the highest number of points, were selected. Experts were paired and given 1 h to work together. Each team was working on one crisis with the objective to develop core characteristics as well as the main consequences and costs of the crisis. In the last part of the workshop, the results for each crisis were presented, and the other experts had the opportunity to add important aspects to each crisis and discuss the findings. The summarized results are presented in Table 1.",

The indicator derives from the definition of \u201crisk\u201d in literature, where the measurement of risks consists of two components. These two components are the probability of occurrence and the threat intensity. This measure of the risk of an event is broadly used in economic and health economic literature and provides an indicator to rank the different scenarios [6, 20\u201326]. We operationalized the probability of occurrence with item 2 (evaluation of future occurrence in one\u2019s own hospital) and threat intensity with item 4 (evaluation of dangerousness). Both values were multiplied to receive an indicator for the severity of a crisis. This multiplication shows the following results (see Fig. 1): staff shortages (220.09), acute loss of personnel following a pandemic (176.67), damage to reputation (168.55), insufficient communication during restructuring (140.72), bullying (132.97), and misuse of drugs (115.75). Because this risk indicator is the most important value to evaluate a crisis for us, we analysed if there are mean differences between the six crises. Each participant evaluated each crisis in a serial order, and so, the evaluations are not independent. That is why a repeated measure ANOVA was calculated. Mauchly\u2019s sphericity test revealed significant variance differences. Thus, we relied our significance testing on the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser procedure, which showed significant mean differences between the risk indicators (F (4.2) = 7.42; p <0.001). Afterwards, we conducted post hoc tests and used a Bonferroni correction which is a conservative procedure to handle the problem of alpha inflation. There were, for example, no significant mean differences between the crisis of staff shortages and the second highest risk indicator (acute loss of personnel following a pandemic; p >0.05) as well as the third highest (damage to reputation; p >0.05), but there were significant mean differences between staff shortages and all other crises (p <0.01).",

We start with the crisis with the highest risk indicator: staff shortages. Reasons for staff shortage result from a demographic imbalance that leads to an increased demand in health-care supply on the one hand and from an ageing health-care workforce on the other [43]. Furthermore, there is a declining share of younger people facing an increasingly older population [27, 44]. Aside from the demographic imbalance, which was identified as the main reason for the crisis, there is a decline of health-care staff, especially of nurses [45]. In a large European study, which examined nurses\u2019 early occupation exits with a sample of 39 898 European nurses, reasons for the lack of staff were identified. Many nurses stated physical and mental stress and lack of staff and time to provide adequate care to patients as reasons to leave the job early [45]. In addition, early retirement, career changes to better paid jobs, or emigration also lead to increasing shortage of staff [46].",

One identified cause for staff shortage\u2014low immigration of skilled personnel\u2014could be solved by increasing the number of apprenticeships and university placements or promoting the immigration of skilled workers [34, 47].

CWB has recently received much attention from researchers and organizations [50]. Due to CWB, 45% of the companies in the US have been subject to one or more significant economic crimes like false pretences or asset misappropriation. Studies showed that personality traits and situational variables affect CWB [50\u201352]. To address dissatisfied employees as the main cause for this identified crisis, maintaining communication and feedback, allowing participation of employees, and supervisory training are recommended factors to mitigate CWBs [53, 54].",

Neglecting effective communication, inappropriate target groups, and poor communication timing are seen as important causes. The right people (i.e. supervisors or committee members as important multipliers) should be informed at the right time with the right information (e.g. purpose, content, and consequences of change) and via the right communication channels (e.g. personal calls or change workshops).

These general antecedents are quite in line with the reasons identified by our experts (see Table 3). Hospitals should therefore ensure a highly qualitative and active management and prevent frustration among their staff. Supervisors and team members should be trained in conflict management skills while tasks and responsibilities should be communicated clearly in order to prevent role conflicts and ambiguities.",

Further, the crises as the basis material of this study were identified in a qualitative explorative way with a limited number of participants. This might influence the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the number of participating hospitals is not high enough for a representative sample. Another limitation in our methodical design is that not only the selection but also the evaluation of the crises can be affected by actual news coverage and current problems in the world. Finally, the definition of the item \u201cDangerousness\u201d can be discussed. This could be interpreted in different directions from different respondents. On the one hand, it can have consequences on monetary aspects; on the other hand, it can have a focus on physical injuries. We decided to use the categorization and the term \u201cdangerousness\u201d which was approved by the research team. The evaluation of costs of HR crises in hospitals could be a point for further research activities. Future research should also pursue a more deductive research strategy and postulates as well as test hypotheses: which crises will occur, when, how, and with which consequences.",

In order to deal with crises, crisis resolution capacity is recommended. An important step to crisis resolution capacity is raised awareness for crises. Knowledge about the various types of crises is, therefore, important. Six HR crises were identified in this study: staff shortages, acute loss of personnel following a pandemic, damage to reputation, insufficient communication during restructuring, bullying, and misuse of drugs by a superior. These crises occurred relatively frequently in German hospitals in the past, and their occurrence probability for the future was estimated to be quite high; especially in other hospitals when compared to one\u2019s own. At the same time, however, a manifold number of causes for crises could be identified in this study. This knowledge is useful to prevent future crises in the HR sector.",
