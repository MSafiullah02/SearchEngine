            "text": "Clinical adoption of combined PET-CT imaging has been surprisingly rapid, and, despite continuing debate, this technology has advanced the use of metabolic and molecular imaging [49], particularly for oncology [11, 39, 40, 43]. However, when discussing the immediate benefits of combined PET-CT examinations, the issue of patient exposure must be taken into account as well. As shown in a multicenter study, whole-body PET-CT examinations \u2013 comprising a PET scan after the administration of the glucose analogue 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) and a fully diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan \u2013 result in an effective dose to patients in the order of 25 mSv and thus mandate a thorough medical justification for each individual patient [5, 8]. A detailed analysis of protocols, which are representative for the imaging scenarios reported in the literature, revealed that up to 70 % of the total exposure is contributed by CT [8]. It would thus be very welcome from a radiation protection point of view if PET-CT could be replaced whenever possible by MR-PET as soon as the methodological challenges of this new imaging technology have been overcome.",

Nevertheless, there are possible risks and health effects associated with the use of diagnostic MR devices that have to be considered carefully [4, 45]. In this context, a fundamental difference between ionizing and nonionizing radiation has to be noted: Radiation doses related to CT or PET procedures may result in stochastic effects (occurring many years later), whereas biological effects of (electro)magnetic fields used in MR are of deterministic nature (occurring immediately). A stochastic process is one where the exposure determines the probability of the occurrence of an event but not the severity of the effect. In contrast, the severity of a deterministic effect is related to the level of exposure and a threshold may be defined [21]. As a consequence, the probability of detrimental effects caused by PET or CT examinations performed over many years accumulate, whereas biophysical and biological effects induced by (electro)magnetic fields used for MR examinations (such as cardiovascular reactions or peripheral nerve stimulation) are related to the acute exposure levels of a particular examination and does, to our present knowledge, not accumulate over years.",

They do not differ in their clinical appearance from cancers that are caused by other factors.

The so-called Life Span Study (LSS) of the survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the most important of these studies [41]. The follow-up of the atomic bomb survivors has provided detailed knowledge of the relationships between radiation risk and a variety of factors, such as the absorbed dose, the age at exposure, the age at diagnosis, and other parameters. The LSS provides data with good radio-epidemiological evidence due to the large size of the study population (about 86,600 individuals with individual dose estimates), the broad age and dose distribution, the long follow-up period (about half a century), and an internal control group (individuals exposed only at a minute level or not at all). The LSS is, therefore, the major source for predicting radiation-induced risks for the general population. However, radiation risk estimates are not merely based on the follow-up of the atomic bomb survivors. They are also largely supported by a multitude of smaller studies, mostly on groups of persons exposed for medical reasons, both in diagnostics and in therapy [1].",

            "text": "There is considerable controversy regarding the risk of low levels of radiation, typical for diagnostic radiation exposures, since radiation risks evaluated at low dose levels are not based on experimental and epidemiological evidence. Given this lack of evidence, estimates on risk, derived from high doses, have been extrapolated down to low dose levels by various scientific bodies, including the \u201cInternational Commission on Radiological Protection\u201d [30], the \u201cUnited Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation\u201d [50], and the \u201cBiological Effects on Ionizing Radiation\u201d committee [1]. Estimates on risk per unit of dose have been derived using the so-called linear, non-threshold (LNT) hypothesis, which is based on the assumptions that (a) any radiation dose \u2013 no matter how small \u2013 may cause an increase in risk and (b) the probability of this increase is proportional to the dose absorbed in the tissue. Although the risk evaluated at low dose levels is thus hypothetical, it is prudent to assume that it exists and that the LNT model represents an upper bound for it. It is for this reason that current radiation protection standards as well as risk assessments are based on the LNT hypothesis [30].",

In the SI system the absorbed dose, D, is given in the unit Gray (1 Gy = 1 J/kg). For radiological protection purposes, the absorbed dose is averaged over an organ or tissue and weighted by a dimensionless radiation weighting factor, w\nR, to reflect the higher biological effectiveness of high-LET as compared to low-LET radiations.

Even in a uniform magnetic field, molecules, structurally ordered molecule assemblies, or cells with a magnetic moment (e.g., outer segments of retinal rod cells, muscle fibers, filamentous virus particles, and erythrocytes) experience a mechanical torque that tends to align their magnetic moment (anti) parallel to the external magnetic field and thus to minimize the potential energy. Orientation effects, however, can only occur when molecular or cellular objects have a nonspherical structure and/or when the magnetic properties are anisotropically distributed. At higher temperatures, as, for example, in the human body, the alignment of structures with small magnetic moments is prevented by their thermal movement (Brownian movement). Additionally, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic objects are attracted in a nonuniform magnetic field, as, for example, in the periphery of an MR system, and thus can quickly become dangerous projectiles (missile effect).\nMagneto-hydromechanical interactions. Static magnetic fields also exert (Lorentz) forces on moving electrolytes (ionic charge carriers), giving rise to induced electric fields and currents. Since electrolytes with a positive or negative charge moving, for example, through a cylindrical blood vessel orientated perpendicular to a magnetic field are accelerated into opposite directions, this mechanism gives rise to an electrical voltage across the vessel, which is commonly referred to as a blood flow potential. In humans, the largest potentials occur across the aorta after ventricular contraction and appear superimposed on the T-wave amplitude of the ECG at fields in excess of 100 mT.\n",

These studies have been reviewed comprehensively \u2013 among others \u2013 by ICNIRP [22] and the World Health Organization [53]. Overall there is little convincing evidence from cellular, animal, human, and epidemiological studies for biologically harmful effects of short-term exposure resulting from static magnetic fields with a strength up to several teslas. Until now, most MR examinations have been performed using static magnetic fields up to 3 T, although whole-body MR systems with static magnetic fields up to 9 T are already used in clinical tests. The literature does not indicate any serious adverse health effects from the exposure of healthy human beings up to 8 T. However, sensations of nausea, vertigo, and metallic taste may occur in magnetic fields above 2 T [23]. The greatest potential health hazard comes from metallic, in particular, ferromagnetic materials (such as scissors, coins, pins, oxygen cylinders) that are accelerated in the inhomogeneous magnetic field in the periphery of an MR system and quickly become dangerous projectiles (missile effect). This risk can only be minimized by a strict and careful management of both patients and staff.",

In contrary, however, biophysical effects related to the electric fields and currents induced by their temporal variation have to be considered carefully. Rapidly switched magnetic fields induce electric fields in the human body, the strength of which is proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic field, dB/dt. In conductive media, such as biological tissues, the electric fields result in circulating eddy currents. In general, rise times of magnetic gradients in MR are longer than 100 \u03bcs, resulting in time-varying electric fields and currents with frequencies below 100 kHz. In this frequency range, the conductivity of cell membranes is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the extra- and intracellular fluid [14]. As a consequence, the current flow is restricted to the extracellular fluid and voltages are induced across the membrane of cells. When these voltages are above a tissue-specific threshold level, they can stimulate nerve and muscle cells [42].",

In contrast, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is of practical concern because uncomfortable or intolerable stimulations would interfere with the examination (e.g., due to patient movements) or would even result in a termination of the examination [51]. Bourland et al. [3] analyzed stimulation data in the form of cumulative frequency distributions that relate a dB/dt level to the number of healthy volunteers that had already reported on perceptible, uncomfortable, or even intolerable sensations. Their results indicate that the lowest percentile for intolerable stimulation is approximately 20 % above the median threshold for the perception of peripheral nerve stimulation. The threshold for cardiac stimulation is well above the median perception threshold for peripheral nerve stimulation, except at very long pulse durations which are, however, not relevant for clinical MR examinations (see Fig. 10.2, [42]).\n\n",

In this RF range, the conductivity of cell membranes is comparable to that of the extra- and intracellular fluid which means that no substantial voltages are induced across the membranes [14]. Due to this reason, stimulation of nerve and muscle cells is no longer a matter of concern. Instead, thermal effects due to tissue heating are of importance. The increase in tissue temperature is dependent not only on localized power absorption and the duration of RF exposure but also on heat transfer and the activation of thermoregulatory mechanisms leading to thermal equalization within the body. It is important to note that energy absorption is proportional to the square of the static magnetic field, B\n0, which means it is markedly higher at high-field as compared to low-field MR systems.",

According to published studies, no adverse health effects are expected if the RF-induced increase in body-core temperature of healthy persons does not exceed 1 \u00b0C [23]. However, some organs of the human body are particularly vulnerable to raised temperatures. The most sensitive organs are the testes and brain as well as portions of the eye.

Accordingly, there is at present no generic justification of MR-PET procedures by professional bodies in conjunction with health and radiological protection authorities as required by ICRP-105 ([31]; cf. Sect. 10.2.2). In this context, not only the improvement in diagnostic accuracy achieved by this new imaging modality will be of relevance but also its practicability, availability, and cost-effectiveness. From a radiation hygienic point of view, an MR-PET examination should be performed instead of a PET-CT examination wherever practicable as long as it provides the same or even superior diagnostic information. Nevertheless, there will be a whole string of clinical situations in which PET-CT will remain the method of choice, as, for example, when CT data are required for radiation treatment planning, when CT is indicated instead of MR for morphological imaging, or when an MR examination is contraindicated in patients due to implants or metallic objects. It goes without saying that an MR-PET examination can only be justified clinically, when there is an individual justification for a PET scan.",

Due to this reason, diagnostic reference levels for [18F]FDG studies performed at conventional PET scanners \u2013 that have meanwhile been established by many states \u2013 may not be appropriate for combined MR-PET examinations. To balance the potentially higher activities that are injected into patients in an attempt to reduce emission scan time, voiding of the bladder should be forced, e.g., by oral hydration with water or the administration of a diuretic. This is a very effective measure, because FDG in the bladder is the major source of internal exposure to the bladder itself as well as to neighboring organs.",

To realize short examination times, the measurement has to be performed with fast MR sequences relying on the use of high-performance gradient and RF systems. At least at high-field MR systems, it will therefore be necessary to carefully optimize the imaging sequences, as, for example, by utilizing SAR reduction techniques like parallel imaging or hyperechos. In this context it has to be noted that \u2013 contrary to a common opinion held among MR users \u2013 the SAR limits given in Table 10.3 do not relate to an individual MR sequence but rather to running SAR averages computed over each 6 min period, which is assumed to be a typical thermal equilibration time (Brix [7]). This means that sequences can be employed for which SAR levels exceed the defined values, if the acquisition time is short in relation to the averaging period and energy deposition has been low previous to the applied high-power sequence.",
