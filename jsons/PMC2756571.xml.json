            "text": "Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is a severe liver injury accompanied by hepatic encephalopathy which causes multi-organ failure with an extremely high mortality rate, even if intensive care is provided. Management of severe FHF continues to be one of the most challenging problems in clinical medicine [39]. Liver transplantation has been shown to be the more effective therapy, but the procedure is limited by the increasing incidence of liver disease due to immunosuppression requirement and shortage of donor organs [18]. Although a number of clinical trials testing different liver assisting devices are in progress [42], these systems alone have no significant effect on patient survival and are only regarded as a useful approach to bridge patients with FHF until liver transplantation [48]. As a result, reproducible experimental animal models resembling FHF clinical conditions are still needed to improve our insight into the metabolic and physiological derangements of FHF and to facilitate the development of new therapeutic modalities [3].",

            "text": "At present, the most commonly used surgical and chemical models possess significant limitations and do not accurately reflect the pattern of human disease in FHF. Moreover, viral hepatitis remains an important cause of FHF in many parts of the world, but the use of infective agents to induce experimental FHF have so far had very limited success [3]. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a member of the Caliciviridae family that causes in wild and domestic rabbits an acute highly fatal disease that was first reported over two decades ago [19]. The disease is characterized by severe necrotizing hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, neurologic symptoms and rapid evolution to death within 48 to 72 h after infection in about 90% of the cases [1]. Hepatic damage plays a central pathogenic role and is histologically similar to fatal viral hepatitis causing FHF in humans [24]. We have shown by data on animal survival, clinical features, histological data, changes in blood chemistry and intracranial pressure monitoring that RHD fulfils many of the requirements of an animal model for FHF [46, 47]. We have also reported that in this model there is a loss in the oxidant/antioxidant balance [35], and that apoptosis, induced via both the intrinsic and the extrinsic signaling pathways, is a constant feature in experimentally infected rabbits [36]. This model could therefore be useful to improve our insight into the pathophysiology of viral FHF and to facilitate the development and evaluation of new therapeutic modalities.",

A common strategy that a virus uses to facilitate its infection and replication is to exploit those altered cellular pathways, which can also contribute to the pathogenesis induced by viral infections [29]. Although the exact significance still remains unknown, recent reports have shown that several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and others can induce the activation of MAPK pathways in infected cells [53]. Modulation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1 have also been reported following infection by the Epstein-Barr virus, influenza virus or Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus [28] while the role of STAT in antiviral responses and pathways regulating apoptosis is well-known [5]. The aim of the present study was to examine changes in MAPK, NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and STAT pathways during RHDV-induced liver cell injury.",

The film was then developed in 16% Ilford Phenisol developer solution and fixed in 16% Ilford Hypam rapid fixer solution (Ilford Imaging UK Ltd., Cheshire, England, UK). Membranes were scanned with a CCD camera and quantified using a Scion Image Software (version 4.0.3.2, Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA). The protein expression rates were normalized through the corresponding expression rates of \u03b2-actin.",

The mediators responsible for the acute phase response are predominantly cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a mediator of the acute phase response that has been reported to be increased in the serum of FHF patients [26]. In the liver of mice and patients with FHF, liver cells express high amounts of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF receptor (TNF-R), and a direct correlation has been demonstrated with the number of apoptotic hepatocytes and the risk of death [40]. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 induces massive apoptosis of hepatocytes in mice with GalN/LPS-induced FHF [27, 33]. Thus, for TNF-\u03b1, over-expression could be an important contributor to the induction of apoptosis by the RHDV infection. On the contrary, processes dependent on IL-6, a downstream hepatotrophic effector cytokine induced by TNF-\u03b1, are mainly conferred to be protective, and it is known that liver regeneration is enhanced by a designer IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor fusion protein with superagonistic IL-6 properties [9].

It is also known that transient JNK activation leads to cell proliferation and is required for liver regeneration [38], whereas sustained JNK promotes cell death [20].

NF-\u03baB is a hallmark of most infections by viral pathogens, mediating expression of many pro-inflammatory or antiviral genes, and has been involved in adhesion molecule gene expression at the transcriptional level [45]. AP-1 is also activated during infection and regulates the expression of a large variety of genes including those involved in the inflammatory response [4]. In our study, the expression of the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 and the enzyme COX-2, both contributing to liver injury in FHF [12, 51], were up-regulated in RHDV-infected rabbits. The effects on these downstream targets could be accounted for, at least partially, by the activation of NF-\u03baB and/or AP-1.",

            "text": "In FHF, the regenerative response is essential for the full functional recovery of the liver and for patient survival, and the expression of genes does not lead to DNA replication unless the cells can progress through the cell cycle. This is dependent on the balance between stimulatory factors released as part of the regenerative response and inhibitory substances [34]. Members of the STAT family have been reported to be involved in regeneration and to play a key role in antiviral defense. Thus, STAT1, when phosphorylated, forms heterodimers, which then translocate into the nucleus to activate the transcription of many target genes, including several antiviral proteins [32]. The essential role of STAT1 in the antiviral and antitumor activity of INF-\u03b1/\u03b2 has been clearly demonstrated in STAT1-deficient mice [23]. It is known that STAT1 is activated in several models of acute liver injury, including Concanavalin A-induced hepatitis and LPS/D-galactosamine-induced liver damage [15]. In the liver, STAT3, mainly activated by IL-6, has been shown to play key roles in acute phase response, protection against liver injury and promotion of liver regeneration [10]. Lethality following partial hepatectomy in TNF-R1 knock out mice is reversed by administration of IL-6 and associated activation of STAT3 [52]. Several STAT3 downstream genes have been identified as important factors contributing to the hepatoprotective and hepatomitogenic effect of IL-6/STAT3 [44]. Activation of STAT3 has also been implicated in INF-\u03b1-mediated antiviral activity in hepatitis C virus replicon cell line [54]. Data from the present research indicate that a transitory STAT1 activation was occasionally observed, but STAT3 was not significantly activated in RHVD-infected rabbits, an effect which could contribute to the lack of regenerative response detected in those animals [35].",

            "text": "Blocking the function of STAT proteins has evolved as a common mechanism for pathogen immune evasion, and numerous viruses, including hepatitis C virus, paramixoviruses or coronaviruses have developed mechanisms to circumvent the host defense by inhibiting host signalling and by disrupting the cross-talk between the MAPK and STAT pathways [7]. One of these mechanisms involves a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. It is known that virus titres are reduced in SOCS3 deficient cells or in cells where SOCS3 expression is knocked-down by siRNA [30]. Moreover, it has been reported that the level of induction of SOCS3 by HSV-1 seems to determine whether infection turns to acute or persistent progression. In addition, it has been suggested that SOCS3 up-regulation may contribute to the non-responsiveness of HCV patients to IFN therapy [31]. The effects mediated by SOCS are related to the fact that these molecules are potent endogenous inhibitors of STAT signaling. Thus, it has been reported that targeted deletion of SCOS3 in macrophages results in markedly enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, and that over-expression of SOCS3 in human hepatoma HepG2 cells suppresses IFN-\u03b1-induced STAT1/3 activation and gene expression of the antiviral proteins [50]. Although other mechanisms could be involved, the fact that SOCS3 was over-expressed in infected rabbits most probably contributed to the inhibition of STAT1/3 expression and therapeutic strategies to block SOCS could be of interest to prevent liver damage and to increase survival in FHF of viral origin.",

Lack of STAT3 activation, probably mediated by SOCS3 over-expression, would have contributed to the inhibition of the regenerative response. Data obtained from this animal model confirm the presence of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage and lack of regeneration and support its usefulness in the investigation of potential novel therapeutical modalities in FHF.",
