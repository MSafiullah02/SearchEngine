Non\u2010severe CAP cases were identified when CAP cases did not present any of the following findings: lower chest indrawing, inability to drink, seizure, somnolence, central cyanosis, grunting in a calm child, and nasal flaring (World Health Organization criteria for severity of CAP, 2000).10 The exclusion criteria were: chronic debilitating diseases (anatomic abnormalities of the respiratory tract, cancer, chronic pulmonary illness besides asthma, immunological defects, progressing neurological disorders, psychomotor retardation, heart disease with clinical repercussion, hemoglobinopathy, liver or kidney disease, severe malnutrition), other concurrent infection, HIV\u2010infected mother, hospitalization during the previous 7 days, amoxicillin or other antibiotics use during the last 48 h, allergy to amoxicillin, or history of aspiration.

The diagnostic criteria of an acute primary HBoV1 infection was the presence of one of the following markers: presence of IgM, a fourfold or greater increase or conversion of IgG in paired sera. The HBoV IgG and the my\u2010capture IgM enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have been described elsewhere.16, 17 Recombinant virus\u2010like particles of VP3 were used as antigen in the two EIAs and cross\u2010reacting antibodies for HBoV2 and 3 were blocked. The cutoff absorbance values for antibody presence (mean + 4 SDs) were 0.095 for our competition IgG and 0.131 for IgM.17 Borderline results in all EIAs were considered indeterminate.",

In many studies in children with CAP, respiratory viruses have been detected in 50\u201070% of the cases.4 However, many viruses including HBoV1 have been detected at similar or higher rates in asymptomatic controls which has questioned whether these viruses are causative agents of CAP.21, 22, 23 This concept is debatable, because respiratory viruses may also cause asymptomatic infections which explains the detection of viruses in asymptomatic subjects.15, 24, 25 Recently, serology has made an important contribution to this question. In the study of Zhang et al, in children with CAP, serology and RT\u2010PCR mostly agreed but serology for RSV, hMPV, PIV 1\u20103, and HAdV increased the diagnostic yields, ranging from 12% to 49%.26 Interestingly, after an acute infection HBoV1 is the only respiratory virus with prolonged viral shedding lasting longer than 1\u20103 weeks,27 which is why serology markedly decreases the yield of HBoV1 diagnoses compared with PCR in the nasopharyngeal mucus. It is of note that HBoV1\u2010asymptomatic acute infections have not been reported. In one study, none of 28 asymptomatic HBoV1\u2010DNA\u2010positive children had spliced HBoV1 mRNA in their nasopharyngeal mucus suggesting that the viruses detected were not replicating.28\n",

It is probable that also studying HBoV1\u2010DNA\u2010negative CAP children would have increased our diagnostic yield. In the study on acute wheezing 13% of children who tested negative for HBoV1\u2010DNA in the nasopharynx showed serologic evidence of acute HBoV1 infection.9 Furthermore, we did not study HBoV1 copy numbers nor HBoV1 DNA in the serum. However, it has been previously shown in a Finnish study that 38% of the children with low\u2010load PCR positivity have acute infection diagnosed by serology whereas 96% of the high\u2010load positive PCR have the same serological diagnosis.16 Therefore, serology should be enough to show reliably the actual acute infections. Moreover, it was very recently published that when compared with serology, DNA PCR had high clinical sensitivity (100%) but, because of viral persistence, low specificity (76%).32 An additional limitation is that no virus\u2010bacterial co\u2010infections were analyzed. The strength of our study includes a long recruitment period lasting almost four and half years, reducing the risk of bias regarding viral seasonality, and a high number of CAP patients. In addition, the serologic studies were carried out in a well\u2010established laboratory of HBoV1 virology. It has been recognized that serology is the most accurate method to diagnose acute HBoV1 infection, even when it was compared to detection of HBoV1 messenger RNA which implies viral replication.32\n",
