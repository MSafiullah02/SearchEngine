The virus was first isolated in primary pig kidney cells by GREIG et al. (9) , who described a cytopathic effect characterized by the appearance of multinucleated cells. The hemadsorption and hemagglutination tests were also used for the demonstration of viral growth. With the immunofluorescence test, HEV was shown to pro agate in several other porcine cell cultures such as IBRS, cell line (5) and SK cell line (14) . Non-porcine cell cultures were shown to have little susceptibility for growth of HEV (5, 16) .",

The HA test applied on PID 7 appeared to be optimal for both PK-15 and SK-6 cells. either refractory (ST cells), or allowed viral growth only to such a slight extent (PPT, SK-6 and PK-15 cells) that they cannot be considered for practical use. In SPTh and PPK cells, all the criteria tested (IF, CPE, Hads, HA) were useful to demonstrate viral replication. When the different criteria were correlated, it was observed that in SPTh cells peaks of all 4 criteria were reached at 48 h post inoculation. The amount of IF, Hads and CPE decreased quickly, while the H A titer remained high until 7 days post inoculation. In PPK cells a similar correlation was observed except that the peaks had a tendency to appear somewhat later and, especially for CPE, reached lower levels. Hemagglutinating activity in the supernatant fluid was the last criterion to become positive and persisted longest in these cells also.",

The comparative infectivity titrations provided further evidence that secondary thyroid and primary kidney cells were more susceptible than the established cell lines. Comparable results were obtained by PIRTLE (16) , who made one titration of HEV in SPTh cells, embryonic porcine kidney cells and PK-15 cells, using the IF test after 48 hours of inoculation as criterion.",

Zum Nachweis der Virusvermehrung in Rohrchen, die mit kleinen Virusmengen beimpft wurden, waren CPE, Hads und H A empfindliche und brauchbare Kriterien.Wiederholte Virustitrationen zei ten eine hohe Variation der Titerendpunkte a u k in hochempfanglichen Zel P kulturen. Die optimale Methode fur die Isolierung von HEV von klinischem Material ist die Verimpfung auf SPTh oder PPK mit anschliei3ender Blindpassage, wenn der HA-Test sieben Tage p. inf. negativ ist.",
