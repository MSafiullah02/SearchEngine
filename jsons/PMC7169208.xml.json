In today's world of rapid global transportation, any location on Earth can be reached in less than 36 hours\u2014a time frame shorter than the incubation period of many diseases, which may take days or even weeks to manifest symptoms. The significance of this is that persons infected with truly terrible afflictions could travel around the world before they even had a sniffle. This may make it more difficult for the health care community to recognize that there is a problem as infected individuals may be spread around the world. A 2005 report by the RAND Corporation indicated that the required public health response will not be proportional to the actual number of people infected or dead because of the need for increased disease surveillance and the number of healthy people that will seek attention because they fear the disease (Stoto et al., 2005, pp. xii\u2013xiii). Furthermore, there are over 5,000 viruses and more than 300,000 species of bacteria that impact humans (Brower & Chalk, 2003). This means that identifying exactly what is causing the illnesses may be difficult. Because an outbreak of disease can occur before anyone is aware of it, governments must become better prepared to address the societal, political, and economic impacts of pandemic disease.",

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 and of avian flu in 2005 and 2006 have raised concerns about governments' abilities to stop the spread of disease and to treat those exposed effectively. Both viruses have also increased awareness of the potential economic losses that a country could incur based on the spread of disease. Recent studies indicate that a severe influenza pandemic could cause a decline in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) as high as 5 percent and a milder epidemic could reduce GDP by about 1.5 percent (Congressional Budget Office, 2006). While estimates of potential economic losses are always contentious, they are useful in demonstrating that there is a potential for significant impact. Furthermore, in the post\u20109/11 world, more attention is being paid to the challenges governments will face in the event of a major bioterrorism incident. In fact, spending on biodefense has increased from $576 million in fiscal year 2001 to a proposed $5.4 billion in 2008 (Franco & Deitch, 2007).",

Several studies and exercises have indicated that hospitals lack the capacity to handle a major influx of infected individuals (Brower & Chalk, 2003; Heinrich, 2004; Stoto et al., 2005). Gaining treatment for large numbers of patients may be a logistical nightmare, if it can be done at all. Other studies indicate that the United States would be likely to experience shortages of the required vaccines or treatments for a large number of ill. Beyond the medical issues, the government may confront civil rights and civil liberties challenges as they attempt to stop the spread of the disease (see also Cohen, Cook, & Louscher, 2004). Travel restrictions may need to be imposed and quarantine or isolation (defined as the confinement of an exposed individual for the incubation period of the disease or of someone with the disease for its duration, respectively) measures may also be necessary (Cohen & Cook, 2006). Either of these measures may be perceived as a violation of the civil liberties of American citizens.",

Certain flu viruses seem to be relatively limited to animal hosts, with little concern about them passing to humans. Therefore, some influenza is extremely dangerous while others pose little threat to society. The most deadly incident of pandemic influenza was the outbreak in 1918. The impact of the 1918 flu on America was so profound that life expectancy within the country decreased by ten years (Billings, 2005). This 1918 flu virus was unique in that it spread very easily from person to person and\u2014unlike most flus, which kill the very young, the elderly, and the infirm\u2014killed healthy adults in the prime of their lives.

People wore cloth masks\u2014sometimes distributed by public health agencies and required of citizens\u2014in public, and stayed in their homes to a large extent (Billings, 2005).

Swine flu began at Fort Dix in New Jersey, where a young recruit informed a drill instructor that he felt ill and was dead within 24 hours. Four of his friends also were stricken with the disease and another 200 soldiers caught swine flu without becoming sick. (Garrett, 1995; Kolata, 1999; Krause, 2006). This incident spawned a massive government and public health movement to inoculate Americans from the disease in the hopes of avoiding another 1918\u2010magnitude epidemic. The fear of the return of a 1918\u2010type influenza was sparked by the similarity of the two viruses. Stockpiling of a swine flu vaccine in case of an outbreak was initially considered, but many worried that waiting for the epidemic to begin would result in broader spread of the disease. Forty\u2010five million people, nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population at the time, were vaccinated through the National Influenza Immunization Program by October 1976 (Krause, 2006). In the end, the epidemic did not occur and more people got sick from Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a side effect of the vaccine, than contracted swine flu (Kolata, 1999).",

Another reason governments are worried about avian flu is that the disease is carried by migratory birds, allowing it to spread along migration paths throughout the world (World Health Organization [WHO], 2006). \u201cWere a strain of influenza much the same as that which caused the 1918\u201320 pandemic to emerge . . . , we estimate that it could kill 51\u201381 million individuals\u201d (Murray et al., 2006, p. 2215). To date, the WHO has recorded 288 cases of avian flu in humans, with 170 of those resulting in death (WHO, 2007). Although there have been a few reported cases of human\u2010to\u2010human infection, experts fear that mutations of the H5N1 virus could make it much more transmissible in the future. Most of the human cases to date have been contracted through contact with infected birds or infected surfaces (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006).",

The CDC is working with the WHO and other international agencies to track the spread of the disease. However, because the disease is not readily transmissible between humans, the CDC has not recommended the wearing of masks or other restrictive measures in response to the disease (CDC, 2007b). Avian flu also sparked the creation of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Influenza Plan in 2005, and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan in 2006 (all discussed in greater detail further in the text). These were focused on improving domestic preparedness for a major disease outbreak. The U.S. State Department has also become involved in the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, which seeks to enhance public health and surveillance through international diplomacy (Salaam\u2010Blyther, 2006, pp. 5\u20136).",

People were afraid to visit countries in which the disease was spreading, leading to a large drop in tourism and business travel. Firms stopped corporate travel to these areas for fear of disrupting business as a result of the potential illness of large numbers of employees.

Almost all hospitals reported participating in a local, state, or regional interagency disaster preparedness committee, and have undergone training of their personnel on identification and diagnosis of disease caused by biological agents considered likely to be used in a bioterrorist attack, such as anthrax or botulism. However, fewer than half of the hospitals have conducted exercises simulating the hospital's response to a bioterrorist incident. Hospitals have reported repeatedly that they lack the medical equipment necessary for a large influx of patients, whether from a bioterror incident or a naturally occurring pandemic. In general, larger hospitals reported more planning and training activities than smaller hospitals (U.S. GAO, 2003c).",

Incarceration of violators would expose prisoners and members of the corrections industry to the disease. What measures would be acceptable to Americans if the country needed to enforce isolation? In the infamous emergency response exercise, Dark Winter (2001), the scenario hypothesized that smallpox was spreading in Oklahoma. By the end of the exercise, officials playing the role of Texas state government ordered National Guard troops to shoot on sight any person trying to cross over their border with Oklahoma (Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, n.d.). While this response may seem extreme, the panic caused by fear of a contagion could generate public and governmental support for what would normally be unacceptable measures. It is possible that people will voluntarily comply with quarantine and isolation orders in the interest of public health and safety. However, the government must plan for the potential that some people will behave differently. President George W. Bush has stated that the military will likely be called to assist in enforcement of curfews and quarantine efforts during a U.S. pandemic disease outbreak:",

Another complicating factor will be present as the pandemic spreads across the country. As discussed earlier, states and localities will have to be relied on as the first responders to a pandemic. They, in turn, will have to rely upon federal assets and assistance in order to respond more effectively. Widespread cases of the disease may dilute federal support such as the SNS and personnel.

Several important conclusions relevant to a global pandemic or bioterrorist attack can be drawn from this analysis. First, SARS is illustrative of the potential impact that fear of a spreading disease may have on a society (e.g., Holloway et al., 1997). In fact, the fear of a global pandemic may have a worse impact on the country than the disease itself. SARS was frightening because it was a new disease to humankind that, because of modern transportation, rapidly traveled around the globe. Avian influenza, pandemic flu, or agents of bioterror such as weaponized smallpox, or any viral hemorrhagic fever, would be comparably fearsome. The impact of SARS was relatively limited in terms of actual medical casualties and geography; endemic diseases such as the seasonal flu, which kills about 36,000 globally each year, and malaria, which kills approximately 3,000 African children daily, have a much greater relative impact in human terms than SARS, which killed less than 800 (World Health Organization, 2003b). However, the psychological impact of the disease on the international economy and on individuals' perceptions of their safety is undeniable, and it foreshadows the calamity which would ensue in the wake of a more serious pandemic.",

Isolation of individuals who are obviously ill or showing symptoms is rarely problematic. However, placing people under quarantine merely because they have been exposed to someone who has the disease or someone who was around someone with the disease just in case they caught it is far more problematic (Annas, 2002; Barbera et al., 2001). For instance, during the SARS epidemic, a flight attendant in Singapore was berated by a neighbor who thought she should put herself under quarantine because she sometimes flew to Hong Kong. The flight attendant declared, \u201cShe has no right to demand that I be quarantined as I'm not sick. I have a job to do and a rice bowl to keep. If SARS goes on for the next six months and I stop work because of it, how do I feed my children?\u201d (Tan, 2003). Such reactions may be common during a pandemic. It is difficult to convince someone that they should disrupt their lives, not go to work, and cut themselves off from society just in case they have contracted the disease. For this reason, government may need to be prepared to intervene with more forcible options than voluntary quarantine.",
