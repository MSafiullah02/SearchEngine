            "text": "For many years, the central nervous system (CNS) was considered an \"immunologically privileged site\" -a perspective based on limited immune surveillance when compared to peripheral tissue, muted expression of MHC molecules in the context of an apparent lack of professional antigen presenting cells, and the absence of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Together, these observations supported the notion that the CNS was unable to mount and/or support an immune response. However, over time this view evolved and it is now clear that CNS tissue is neither immunologically inert nor privileged, rather, its immune response is exquisitely sensitive to antigenic challenge. Indeed, overwhelming evidence now indicates that upon microbial infection of the CNS there is often a dynamic and orchestrated localized immune response that culminates with infiltration of antigen-specific lymphocytes, usually resulting in control and elimination of the invading pathogen. It is important to note that not all effective immune responses originating in the CNS are completely beneficial to the host; alternatively, there are instances where immune cell infiltration following infection is associated with severe neuropathology resulting in death or chronic neurodegenerative disease.",

            "text": "The signaling events governing leukocyte infiltration into the CNS in response to infection are complex and depend on many factors including type of pathogen, e.g. intracellular or extracellular, the route of infection, cellular tropism (neuron and/or glial cells), and genetic background of the host. Nevertheless, it is now apparent that leukocyte trafficking is partially dependent on a class of small (7-17 kDa) chemotactic cytokines known as chemokines (chemotatic cytokine). Chemokines represent a family of over 40 proteins, which for the most part are secreted into the environment and function by binding to chemokine receptors in the form of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed on numerous cell types. Four sub-families of chemokines have been identified and defined based on structural criteria relating to the location of conserved cysteine residues within the amino-terminus of the protein. Chemokines were initially discovered close to 30 years ago and their strong association with various human inflammatory diseases led some researches to theorize, and later confirm, that they influence leukocyte recruitment into inflamed tissue. In fact, it is now accepted that this superfamily of proteins plays an important role in numerous biological processes ranging from maintaining the organizational integrity of secondary lymphoid tissue to participating in various aspects of both innate and adaptive immune responses following microbial infection.

In all cases, we have tried to provide information pertaining to regulation of chemokine expression and functional roles within the context of animal models of disease as well as clinical disease. We certainly acknowledge that other microbial pathogens e.g. fungi and parasites are capable of infecting and replicating within the CNS and chemokines/chemokine receptors have been suggested to participate in host responses. However, our focus was weighted by the fact that the overwhelming majority of clinical infections involving the CNS relate to viral or bacterial infection.",

Indeed, exposure to a neurotropic virus at some point during the course of a normal human lifespan is almost inevitable. While the majority of these encounters will result in a benign and clinically silent course of infection often associated with life-long persistence of virus, others can be quite severe and potentially life-threatening. A common pathological feature of many neurotropic viruses is acute meningitis and/ or encephalitis that occur as a result of neuroinflammation due to chemotactic signals derived within the CNS in response to infection. While immune cell infiltration may be beneficial by attracting antigen-specific T cells required for reducing viral load, in many of these cases, the amplified inflammatory responses can also be dangerous and lead to permanent, immune-mediated neurologic damage and/or death. It is now widely accepted that resident cells of the CNS are quite capable of secreting a number of different chemokines that undoubtedly contribute to directing distinct subsets of leukocytes into the CNS based upon surface expression of chemokine receptors . Therefore, defining chemokine/chemokine receptor expression profiles within the CNS of viral-infected hosts provides important information on potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

It is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease in humans that presents as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis (Jahrling and Peters 1992) . Infection of the murine CNS with LCMV results in a well-established model of viral meningitis (Buchmeier et al., 1980; Buchmeier and Zajac 1999) . LCMV infection of the CNS of adult, immunocompetent mice results in a monophasic disease characterized by leukocyte infiltration into distinct anatomic regions of the brain and ultimately death between 6-8 days post-infection (p.i.) (Buchmeier et al., 1980) . Specifically, infiltrating CD8 + T cells are essential in contributing to cell damage and death in LCMV-infected mice. Instillation of LCMV into the CNS of immunocompetent mice reveals that expression of chemokine RNA in the CNS precedes the infiltration of immune cells (Asensio and Campbell 1997) . Transcripts for CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL7 are apparent in the CNS of LCMV infected mice 3 days p.i. and increase by day 6, correlating with accumulation of activated T cells (Asensio and Campbell 1997) . Astrocytes are, in part, responsible for expression of certain chemokines including CXCL10 following LCMV infection (Asensio et al., 1999) . These early results suggested that chemokine expression in the CNS represents an early host response to intracranial (i.c.) infection with LCMV and drives subsequent immunopathology.",

Studies using CCR5deficient mice (CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice) suggested that CCR5 signaling on T cells is dispensable with regards to regulating T cell migration into the CNS, as LCMV-infection of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice results in a lethal T cell-mediated meningitis with no change in the composition of the cellular infiltrate within the CNS of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to controls (Nansen et al., 2002) . In contrast, LCMV infection of the CNS in CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice results in a dramatic increase in survival that correlated with paucity in CD8 + T cells migrating into the parenchyma from the meninges; however, no alterations in the distribution of viral antigen between infected CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice and wildtype control mice were observed (Christensen et al., 2004) . Importantly, reconstitution of LCMV-infected CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice with CXCR3 + / + CD8 + T cells restored susceptibility to viral-induced meningitis (Christensen et al., 2004) .

Subsequent studies indicated that CXCL10, but not CXCL9 or CXCL11, is the key signaling molecule responsible for recruiting effector T cells into the CNS of LCMVinfected mice (Christensen et al., 2006) . However, given the overlapping chemokine expression profiles that exist within the CNS of LCMV-infected mice there is the possibility of functional redundancy as well as compensatory mechanisms that may be employed in the absence of specific chemokine signaling pathways. Indeed, LCMV-infection of mice deficient in both CXCR3 and CCR5 (CXCR3/CCR5deficient mice) indicated that lack of both receptors does not impair generation of virus-specific T cells suggesting that signaling through these receptors is not critical in generating virus-specific T cells (de Lemos et al., 2005) . Although T cell infiltration into the CNS of either CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 or CXCR3/CCR5-deficient mice was reduced compared to wild-type mice, there were greater numbers of CD8 + T cells present in the neural parenchyma of double-deficient mice compared to CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that CCR5 may function to negatively regulate the antiviral CD8 + T cell response (de Lemos et al., 2005) .",

Adoptive transfer of WNV-immune splenocytes into infected CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice restored protection that correlated with increased T cell infiltration into the CNS. Supporting the importance of CCR5 signaling in host defense against WNV-induced neurologic disease are findings that indicate humans harboring the CCRDelta32 deletion have increased susceptibility to WNV-induced disease . Indeed, CCR5Delta32 homozygosity was significantly associated with fatal outcome after WNV infection in one patient cohort examined highlighting the importance of this receptor in defense following viral infection of the CNS.",

            "text": "The first thorough study to characterize the chemokine gene expression profile within the cornea of HSV-1-infected mice was performed in 1996 using PCR (Su et al., 1996) . Chemokines detected included CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL5 (Su et al., 1996) . With the exception of CXCL10, expression of chemokines as well as proinflammatory cytokines is transient and occurs during the innate immune response. Recent investigations into molecular signaling pathways involved in initiating chemokine gene expression in response to HSV-1 infection of the CNS have revealed differential requirements for members of the TLR family with regards to chemokine gene expression. TLR2 is required for production of various proinflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL4, and CXCL5 (Aravalli et al., 2005) . In contrast, increased production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 required both TLR9 as well as type I interferon signaling pathways (Wuest et al., 2006) . HSV-1 infection of either TLR2\u2212/\u2212 or TLR9\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in an attenuated inflammatory response highlighting a previously unappreciated role for TLR signaling pathways in regulating viral neuropathogenesis (Aravalli et al., 2005; Wuest et al., 2006) . Additional studies by various groups employing either neutralizing antibodies or chemokine/chemokine receptor knock-out mice have also aided in defining the functional contributions of these molecules to disease. CXCL2 promotes neutrophil trafficking by signaling through the receptor CXCR2 expressed on the cell surface. Administration of anti-CXCL2 antibody to HSV-1-infected mice or infection of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed limited neutrophil accumulation within the cornea (Maertzdorf et al., 2002; Yan et al., 1998) . Blocking CXCL10 during the acute phase of HSV-1 ocular infection resulted in increased viral titers within the stroma and trigeminal ganglion, but limited corneal pathology, although spread of virus from the cornea stroma into the retina was markedly restricted in anti-CXCL10 treated mice (Carr et al., 2003) . In addition, viral antigen was co-localized with infiltrating CD11b + cells suggesting that viral infection of inflammatory cells facilitates spread of the virus to other restricted anatomical regions of the eye (Carr et al., 2003) . These findings led investigators to hypothesize that upon HSV-1 infection of the cornea, CXCL10 serves to orchestrate inflammatory responses that function to control viral replication, but also may serve to disseminate virus to other regions of the eye by enabling infection of inflammatory cells (Carr et al., 2003) . HSV-1 infection of CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed somewhat surprising results as mice deficient in CXCR3 signaling exhibited an overall increase in survival rate compared to infected wildtype mice, which was associated with a 2-fold increase in the frequency of infiltrating T cells within the trigeminal ganglion (Wickham et al., 2005) . Similarly, HSV-1 infection of mice lacking CCR5 allowed for characterization of the contributions of CCR5 ligands CCL3 and CCL5 to defense and/or disease. HSV-1 infection of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in no difference in mortality despite deficiencies in controlling viral replication in the eye . This approach highlights the potential overlapping compensatory mechanisms that are inherent within the chemokine family.",

Infection with MV typically results in an acute febrile illness and rash due to viral replication first in mono-and lymphocytic cells, and then in a variety of tissues (Katz 1995 ). MV infection is typically self-limiting due to the generation of the virus-specific immune response (Griffin and Bellini 1996) . In the rare case, however, MV re-emerges in fully immunocompetent individuals in the CNS months to years following the resolution of the acute infection resulting in a fatal disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) (ter Meulen et al., 1983) . The pathological hallmarks of SSPE include demyelination, gliosis, and T lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS accompanied by expression of chemokines and cytokines (Anlar et al., 2001; Hofman et al., 1991; Nagano et al., 1994; Schnorr et al., 1997) . As infiltration of activated immune cells into the CNS is important in disease pathogenesis in SSPE, understanding the signals regulating leukocyte invasion is critical to potential disease intervention. Infection of human astrocyte cultures with MV (either live virus or ultraviolet-inactivated) results in production of mRNA transcripts for CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 (Noe et al., 1999; Xiao et al., 1998) . Addition of cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 to viral-infected cultures did not result in a synergistic effect with regards to chemokine transcript expression, but rather selectively inhibited CCL2 and CCL4 transcript levels (Xiao et al., 1998) . These intriguing results suggest localized expression of cytokines may regulate chemokine gene expression and modulate disease by altering the composition of the cellular infiltrate. Analysis of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients contained elevated levels of chemokines, in which CXCL10 was predominantly expressed (Saruhan-Direskeneli et al., 2005) .",

Intracranial infection of transgenic NSE-CD46 neonate (day 1) mice with MV results in widespread viral replication in neurons that leads to acute encephalitis, seizures, weight loss and ataxia, with death occurring by day 15-20 p.i. (Rall et al., 1997) . T and B lymphocytes enter the CNS and are found in association with MV-antigen expressing neurons following MV infection in NSE-CD46 mice (Manchester et al., 1999) . The contribution of these cells to host defense was determined using adoptive transfer of immune cell subsets into transgenic CD46expressing mice. These studies revealed that CD4 + T lymphocytes in combination with CD8 + T lymphocytes or B cells are necessary for protection during MV infection (Tishon et al., 2006) . Additionally, neurons contributed to chemokine expression in the CNS following MV infection of NSE-CD46 mice (Patterson et al., 2003) . In these experiments chemokine transcripts for CXCL10 and CCL5 were elevated in CNS tissues isolated from MV infected immunodeficient NSE-CD46/ Rag-2 knock-out (ko) mice, as well as from MV-infected primary hippocampal neuron cultures established from embryonic NSE-CD46 mice (Patterson et al., 2003) . Neutralization of CXCL10 and CCL5 with polyclonal neutralizing antisera resulted in significant reductions in CD4 + and CD8 + T cell infiltration into the CNS following MV infection of NSE-CD46 mice (Patterson et al., 2003) . Therefore, these findings highlight the functional relevance of chemokines in the neuropathogenesis of MV infection and reveal potential targets for therapy in SSPE patients.",

Glial cells are sensitive to CMV infection and are capable of secreting chemokines. For example, CMV infection of astrocytes did not result in the production of antiviral cytokines but does generate chemokines CCL8 and CCL2 (Cheeran et al., 2001) . However, CMV infection of microglial cells promoted production of anti-viral cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, in addition to chemokines, such as CXCL10 (Cheeran et al., 2003) . It is possible that CMVinfected astrocytes attract microglial cells to sites of infection to aid in host defense via secretion of anti-viral cytokines. In support of this possibility are data demonstrating an ~60% reduction in viral gene expression in CMV-infected astrocytes co-cultured with microglia (Cheeran et al., 2001) . CXCL10 expressed from CMVinfected microglia may aid in host defense by attracting T cells into the CNS (Cheeran et al., 2004) . Infection of immunodeficient mice with murine CMV (MCMV) resulted in unrestricted viral replication within the brain and ultimately death (Cheeran et al., 2004) . In addition, there were elevated levels of CCL2 and CXCL10 within the brains of MCMV-infected immunodeficient animals, which likely reflect the increase in viral burden. Transfer of splenocytes obtained from MCMV-primed animals into infected immunodeficient mice resulted in protection from lethal disease. These findings indicate that localized expression of chemokines is not sufficient to control viral replication in the absence of an adaptive immune response (Cheeran et al., 2004) . Further, these findings suggest that expression of T cell chemoattractant chemokines, such as CXCL10, may exert a protective effect by attracting T cells to sites of viral replication (Cheeran et al., 2004) .",

HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE), the histological correlate of HAD, occurs in the majority of HAD cases and the pathological hallmarks include blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, productive viral infection, inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages, astrogliosis, microgliosis and neuronal loss (Budka 1991; Cartier et al., 2005) .",

Although the molecular mechanisms are currently unknown, chemokines are thought to be central regulators of this process (Cartier et al., 2005; Speth et al., 2005) . For example, recent studies demonstrate that the presence of CCL2 within the brain promotes migration of HIV-infected leukocytes into the CNS (Eugenin et al., 2006) . CXC3CL1 and CXCL12 have also been implicated in the transmigration of lymphocytes and monocytes across the BBB (Nottet 1999) . Once HIV enters the brain, virus-host interactions and viral protein release lead to altered chemokine expression that can result in activation or proliferation of microglia and astrocytes or activation of neuronal chemokine receptors resulting in neuronal dysfunction or death (Speth et al., 2005) . High CCL2 concentrations in the CSF of SIV-infected macaques correlate with a significantly higher expression of macrophage/microglia and astrocyte activation markers suggesting involvement of CCL2 in microgliosis and astrocytosis (Zink et al., 2001) . As an inducer of astrocyte proliferation, enhanced expression of CXCL12 during HIV encephalitis likely contributes to astrocytosis as well (Bonavia et al., 2003) . Factors released by activated microglia and astrocytes may indirectly or directly contribute to neuronal damage. Additionally viral proteins such as gp120 can act as chemokine agonists and activate signaling pathways in astrocytes and neurons resulting in neurodegeneration (Kaul et al., 2005) . Taken together, these studies support the notion that chemokines and chemokine receptors are serving, in part, as mediators of disease leading to the pathogenesis associated with HAD.",

Among the protective functions that chemokines and chemokine receptors play are competition for HIV binding, modulation of astrocyte and microglia activation and protection from HIV-induced neurotoxicity (Speth et al., 2005) . Corasaniti et al., (2001a, b) showed that CXCL12 elicits protection against gp120-induced neuronal apoptosis in rats and suggests that this protection is conferred through a shift in the competition of gp120 and CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 in favor of CXCL12. Regarding protection from neurotoxicity, studies support a role for CCL2 and CX3CL1 in protecting neurons from Tat-induced apoptosis (Eugenin et al., 2003; Tong et al., 2000) . Diminished microglial production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species following CX3CL1 treatment has been observed, yet the mechanism is currently under investigation (Mizuno et al., 2003) .",

Coronaviruses infect numerous vertebrate hosts including humans, chickens, pigs, and mice causing a wide variety of disorders involving a number of different organ systems; however, there are specific tropisms for the CNS, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and liver (Holmes and Lai 1996; McIntosh 1996; Perlman et al., 1999) . Receptor use among the varied coronaviruses is restricted to several well-defined proteins. Human coronavirus infections result in acute enteritis as well as 15% of common colds indistinguishable from those caused by other viruses (Holmes and Lai 1996; McIntosh 1996; Perlman et al., 1999) . More recently, a human coronavirus (CoV) has been indicated to be the etiologic agent for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is a potentially lethal disease and is recognized as a health threat internationally (Holmes 2003) . Although normally considered an upper respiratory tract pathogen, SARS CoV was recently isolated from brain tissue of a SARS patient with significant neurologic symptoms and neuropathology associated with neuronal necrosis and glial hyperplasia (Xu et al., 2005) . Analysis of blood samples revealed a dramatic increase in CXCL9 and CXCL10 protein levels (Xu et al., 2005) . Moreover, immunostaining showed discrete patterns of CXCL9 expression by glial cells that was associated with infiltrating T cells and macrophages. These findings demonstrate that SARS CoV is capable of infecting the CNS and is associated with neurologic disease characterized by immune cell infiltration in which chemokine signaling may be important.",

Indeed, MHV infection of CCL3\u2212/\u2212 mice results in deficient activation and accumulation of myeloid dendritic cells into draining cervical lymph nodes that results in muted activation of virus-specific T cells (Trifilo et al., 2003; Trifilo and Lane 2004) . For example, virus-specific CD8 + T cells are unable to undergo egress from lymphatic tissue and migrate into the CNS as a result of impaired expression of tissue-specific homing receptors e.g. chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 (Trifilo et al., 2003) . In addition, virus-specific CD4 + T cells derived from MHV-infected CCL3\u2212/\u2212 mice produce increased levels of IL-10 and diminished IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated with viral antigen (Trifilo and Lane 2004) .

            "text": "Blocking either CXCL9 or CXCL10 during acute disease resulted in increased mortality that correlated with reduced infiltration of CXCR3 + T cells into the CNS and increased viral titers, demonstrating an important role for these chemokines in host defense by attracting T cells into the CNS (Dufour et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001a . However, blocking CXCL10 during chronic disease was beneficial as animals recovered locomotor activity that was associated with reduced T cell infiltration into the CNS and extensive remyelination (Liu et al., 2001b) . Therefore, CXCL10 is either protective or contributes to disease depending on the stage of disease. Further support for the importance of CXCL10 in modulating disease is derived from studies demonstrating that antibody-targeting of CXCR3 improves clinical outcome during chronic disease by reducing T cell accumulation within the CNS (Stiles et al., 2006b) . Importantly, the influence of blocking CXCL10 signaling appears to be at the level of trafficking rather than muting specific T cell effector functions e.g. cytokine secretion or proliferation (Stiles et al., 2006a) . In addition to CXCL10, the chemokine CCL5 also promotes protection during acute disease as well as amplifies disease severity during chronic disease (Glass et al., 2004 (Glass et al., , 2001 . CCL5 is capable of recognizing the receptors CCR1 and CCR5, which are surface receptors present on activated macrophages and T cells. MHV infection of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 did not significantly impact host defense, but demyelination was reduced and this correlated with paucity in macrophage accumulation within the CNS (Glass et al., 2001) . These findings suggest that CCR5 signaling promotes macrophage trafficking but does not significantly impact T cell migration. However, MHV infection of mice deficient in CCR1 signaling (CCR1\u2212/\u2212 mice) did not affect viral clearance from the brain, although there was a reduction in CD8 + T cell accumulation (Hickey et al., 2007) . Further, MHV-infected CCR1\u2212/\u2212 mice ultimately succumbed to fatal disease during the chronic stage of infection in the absence of any significant change in the composition of the cellular infiltrate (Hickey et al., 2007) . Therefore, these data demonstrate that neither CCR1 nor CCR5 signaling alone is necessary for optimal host defense during acute disease, but both receptors influence the disease pathogenesis during chronic disease.",

Importantly, TMEV infection serves as an excellent model for the human demyelinating disease MS due to similarities in neuropathology. TMEV infection results in activation of various chemokine genes within the CNS including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL0 that precedes and accompanies leukocyte infiltration into the CNS and is associated with onset of clinical disease (Hoffman et al., 1999; Ransohoff 2002) . In vitro studies have revealed that TMEV infection results in a dramatic increase in the synthesis of chemokine mRNA transcripts (Palma and Kim 2001; Palma and Kim 2004; So et al., 2006) . Chemokine gene activation was largely independent of type I IFN signaling but completely dependent upon NF\u03baB and IRF/ISRE pathways (Palma and Kim 2004; So et al., 2006) . More recently, induction of chemokine gene expression was found to occur in a TLR3-dependent manner (Palma and Kim 2004; So et al., 2006) . Functional studies have ruled out CXCL10 as important in either host defense or disease following TMEV infection, indicating that alternative signaling pathways promote these separate events (Tsunoda et al., 2004) . Moreover, antibody targeting of either CXCL9 or CCL5 results in increased viral antigen expression within the CNS and increased spinal cord pathology, suggesting that these chemokines serve to restrict viral gene expression (Ure et al., 2005) . Therefore, the TMEV model of viral-induced neurologic disease is distinct from others with regards to chemokines participating in leukocyte infiltration into the CNS and/or disease progression. Indeed, CNS-derived chemokine gene expression in TMEV-infected mice during chronic disease appears to be dictated primarily by viral persistence and is independent of genetic factors related to susceptibility, severity of neuropathology, and the presence or absence of regulatory T cells (Ransohoff 2002) .",

Unlike viruses, the majority of these bacteria do not require a host cell for survival and replication within the CNS. Rather, many bacterial infections of the CNS stem from the colonization of the CSF. In general, these pathogens gain access to the CNS following septicemia, which facilitates passage of the bacterium and immune cells across the BBB, culminating in diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis and brain abscess. Notably, bacterial meningitis accounts for one of the top ten infectious causes of death throughout the world (Nau and Bruck 2002; Scheld et al., 2002) . The high mortality rate associated with these infections and the prevalent neurologic damage incurred by survivors is the result of pathological changes within the CNS due to (1) direct damage elicited by the pathogen itself and (2) the strong host inflammatory response within the CNS during the bacterial infection. For instance, gram-positive bacteria induce a robust neuroinflammatory response via immunoreaction to the peptidoglycan-techoic acid that constitutes the bacterial cell wall. Similarly, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contained within the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is highly antigenic and contributes to bacterialmediated CNS pathogenesis. The resulting host inflammatory response contributes to CNS damage at the site of infection due to the toxic effects of immune mediators including cytokines, chemokines, oxidative agents and proteolytic enzymes Pfister and Scheld 1997) . Similar to the viral infections discussed in the first section of this chapter, recruitment and activation of leukocytes is a hallmark of acute inflammation in response to bacteria and it is evident that chemokines also play a vital role in this process. Therefore, understanding the role of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression within the CNS of bacteria-infected hosts may uncover potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Indeed, in many instances the level and duration of chemokine expression in response to bacterial infection surpasses what is often observed following viral infections. Presumably, the presence of higher levels of antigens, including cell wall products and/or various secreted virulence factors likely contribute to this feature of the bacteria-induced inflammation. Targeted studies have revealed the presence of elevated levels of CXCL8, CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with bacterial meningitis compared to controls (Lahrtz et al., 1998; Spanaus et al., 1997; Sprenger et al., 1996) . More recently, global screening for a broad range of chemokines in the CSF of similar patients has also demonstrated significantly enhanced levels of CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL10, CCL8 and CCL20 (Kastenbauer et al., 2005) . Importantly, CXCL8 expression correlates well with neutrophil infiltration, which are the predominant leukocytes present during bacteria-mediated CNS infections (Halstensen et al., 1993; Lahrtz et al., 1998; Mastroianni et al., 1998; Spanaus et al., 1997; Sprenger et al., 1996) . However, the frequent presence of chemokines, such as, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4, in the context of comparatively low monocyte infiltration during CNS infections caused by bacteria suggests that these chemokines play a broader role in the host anti-bacterial response beyond leukocyte trafficking, and emphasizes the importance of future research dedicated to this field (Inaba et al., 1997; Lahrtz et al., 1998; Mastroianni et al., 1998; Spanaus et al., 1997; Sprenger et al., 1996) . The following section of this chapter is intended to highlight the common bacteria associated with CNS disease that have been studied in the context of chemokine regulation and signaling.",

            "text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is a gram-positive pathogenic bacterium that is the primary causative agent of otitis media and bacterial pneumoniae (Bridy-Pappas et al., 2005) . Importantly, it is also the primary cause of bacterial meningitis in adults, accounting for nearly 50% of all reported cases (Bridy-Pappas et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2001) . S. pneumoniae commonly resides within the nasopharynx of healthy individuals, but in many cases, colonization in other areas of the host results in septicemia, subsequent breaching of the BBB and infection of the meninges. Pneumococcal meningitis has a nearly 30% mortality rate and in the majority of cases a high frequency of neurologic defects in survivors (Bohr et al., 1984; Bridy-Pappas et al., 2005; Edwards et al., 1985; Pfister et al., 1993) . The high rate of fatal cases is speculated to be a result of an initial suboptimal host immune response against S. pneumoniae. The poor immune response can be attributed in part to the polysaccharide capsule surrounding S. pneumoniae that has been shown to facilitate immune evasion, thus giving it the advantage of reaching high bacterial titers, which ultimately contributes to an unfavorable inflammatory environment (Musher 1992) . Indeed, chemokine expression is a hallmark of S. pneumoniae infection and several chemokines, such as CXCL1, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 are expressed in the CSF of patients with meningitis (Lahrtz et al., 1998; Spanaus et al., 1997; Sprenger et al., 1996) . A similar chemokine protein profile was seen in resident mouse microglia stimulated with the highly immunogenic cell wall components from S. pneumoniae (Hausler et al., 2002) . In a mouse model of pneumococcal meningitis that mimics the natural route of infection in humans, CXCL2 was highly expressed following intranasal infection (Zwijnenburg et al., 2001) . These and other studies have focused on determining the function and regulation of chemokines in the context of pneumococcal meningitis. For instance, CSF from pneumococcal meningitis patients was chemotactic for neutrophils and mononuclear leukocytes (Lahrtz et al., 1998; Spanaus et al., 1997; Sprenger et al., 1996) . Given that neutrophils are the predominant immune cell infiltrate during acute disease, other groups have taken a closer look at the function of CXCL8, and its mouse homolog, CXCL2. In a rabbit model of LPS induced meningitis, CXCL8 blockade resulted in reduced leukocyte recruitment (Dumont et al., 2000) . Likewise, intravenous treatment with anti-CXCL8 antibody in a rabbit model of S. pneumoniae-induced meningitis impaired leukocyte accumulation in the CSF (Ostergaard et al., 2000) . CXCL2 expression in mice appears to be dependent on toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Mice deficient for MyD88, an integral signal transduction molecule involved in TLR signaling, exhibited a reduced inflammatory host response, including significant reduction in CXCL2 expression, which resulted in higher bacterial titers in the CNS and increased aggravation of disease compared to wild-type mice (Koedel et al., 2004) . While these results are interesting with regards to CXCL8, it is apparent that more work needs to be focused on understanding the role of the other chemokines expressed during pneumococcal meningitis. Recent work has demonstrated an even broader array of chemokine protein expression including CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL10, CCL8 and CCL20 in CSF of meningitis patients (Kastenbauer et al., 2005) ; and at least one study implicates the cytokine IFN-\u03b3 in differentially modulating chemokine production in resident CNS macrophages in response to components of the S. pneumoniae cell wall (Hausler et al., 2002) . In summary, these studies suggest that inflammation in the CNS following S. pneumoniae infection is dynamically regulated by a distinct chemokine profile and highlights the importance of microglia as key mediators of this active process.",

            "text": "Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) is known best as a primary pathogen of meningitis that has the potential to cause epidemic outbreaks (Manchanda et al., 2006) . N. meningitidis is gram-negative bacterium that elicits a robust host immune response through its LPS-rich cell wall. In fact, the severity of clinical presentation appears to correlate with the level of LPS within the CSF (Moller et al., 2005) . Like S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis resides within the human nasopharynx and is transmitted by respiratory spread. Its antiphagocytic capsule also gives N. meningitidis the advantage of evading immune clearance, which can result in high titers of the pathogen in the blood that ultimately facilitates breaching of the BBB. Upon infection of the CNS, meningeal cells appear to be a prominent source of chemokine production during meningococcal infection (Fowler et al., 2006) . Binding of N. meningitidis to these cells results in high levels of CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL8 expression (Fowler et al., 2006) , BBB damage and access to the CNS. Targeted studies, have demonstrated that the chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1 and CXCL8 are expressed in the CSF from patients with meningococcal meningitis (Moller et al., 2005; Spanaus et al., 1997) . Importantly, CSF from these patients is also chemotactic for inflammatory immune cells (Spanaus et al., 1997) , supporting the functional role of chemokines for positional migration of immune cells in the context of bacterial meningitis. Additional evidence lies in the observation that the CSF from similar patients infected with N. meningitidis also contained significant levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL8, which had an inverse correlation with the relative bacterial load (Moller et al., 2005) , and in vivo and ex vivo studies demonstrated that LPS was the major mediator of chemokine secretion (Moller et al., 2005) . Enhanced CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL8 protein production was associated with increasing concentrations of LPS; however, the plasma CCL5 levels were inversely related (Moller et al., 2005) , suggesting that CCL5 does not play a major role in leukocyte recruitment to the site of CNS infection. Meningeal cells appear to be a prominent source of chemokine production during a meningococcal infection, as CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL8 are each highly expressed following in vitro binding studies with N. meningitidis (Fowler et al., 2006) . This robust host neuroinflammatory response elicited at the site of CNS infection may indeed have consequences beyond direct damage to CNS tissue. Leukopenia is a common feature in patients with systemic meningococcal infections often resulting in fatal septic shock (Flaegstad et al., 1995; Kornelisse et al., 1997) . It is interesting to speculate that strong expression of chemokines at the site of infection may effectively deplete the levels of circulating leukocytes, ultimately contributing to high bacterial titers and the resulting fatal disease outcome.",

            "text": "Pathogenic strains of the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) are defined by the presence of a capsule and are grouped into six types (A-F) that cause a variety of diseases affecting the ear, upper respiratory tract and CNS (Murray et al., 2005) . H. influenza type B (HiB) was the number one cause of acute meningitis in infant and young children in the United States until widespread use of the HiB vaccine reduced reported cases to less than 10% since 1990 (Schuchat et al., 1997) . Similar to S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis, the CSF from patients with Hib contains significant amounts of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1 and CXCL8 (Spanaus et al., 1997) . In addition, similar findings were observed in a rat model of Hib, as significant levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL2 were expressed within 24-48 h post infection (Diab et al., 1999) . Importantly, expression of these chemokines correlated well with the recruitment of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages into the meninges, and also with disease severity (Diab et al., 1999) . CXCL2 and CCL3 expression was detected in neutrophils and macrophages in the subarachnoid space that separates the meningeal cells from the lateral ventricles. CCL2 expression localized to infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, and to some extent, astrocytes, whereas CCL5 expression occurred predominantly in astrocytes and resident microglia. The functional roles of CXCL2, CCL2 and CCL3 in immune cell trafficking during HiB infection were also determined by using neutralizing antibody studies (Diab et al., 1999) . Treatment with anti-CCL2 significantly reduced macrophage infiltration into the subarachnoid space, while anti-CXCL2 treatment impaired neutrophil trafficking. It is important to note that this study was the first to show that anti-CCL3 also abrogated neutrophil recruitment, despite the observation that this chemokine is not capable of neutrophil recruitment in vitro. However, other studies are starting to show a role of CCL3 in neutrophil trafficking in vivo (Ajuebor et al. 2004; Ramos et al. 2005; Standiford et al. 1995) . Interestingly, selective chemokine blockade also modulated the expression of the other chemokines; e.g. anti-CCL3 administration resulted in downregulation of CCL5, but simultaneous upregulation of CCL2 and CXCL2 (Diab et al. 1999 ). Therefore, it is possible that blocking CCL3 expression may have an indirect effect on neutrophil recruitment by modulating the expression of other chemokines, again highlighting the complex interplay between the regulatory events controlling chemokine regulation and immune infiltration during infection.",

Transmission of L. monocytogenes and the pathogenesis of listeriosis are facilitated by several key features (Murray et al. 2005) . For instance, it is a hardy bacterium that survives in soil, high heat and is able to replicate at low temperatures, thus facilitating transmission as a food-borne pathogen. Furthermore, it is a facultative intracellular bacterium that evades immune surveillance by surviving within macrophages and endothelial cells and can move from cell-to-cell via actin-based motility without exposure to other immune factors, such as antibodies and complement. In fact, Listeria can infect a variety of cell types, including neurons, astrocytes and meningeal cells. Chemokine signaling is considered important for controlling intracellular replication of Listeria by recruiting activated monocytes across the BBB and into the subarachnoid space (Frei et al. 1993) . In an experimental mouse model, Seebach, et al. (1995) showed that the immune cell infiltration to the meninges is temporally regulated following intracerebral infection with L. monocytogenes. Within 24 h p.i., roughly 80% of the infiltrating cells were neutrophils, with monocytes making up approximately 50% of the inflammatory cells after 72 h p.i. (Seebach et al., 1995) . The immune cell influx correlated well with time-dependent chemokine expression, as CCL3 and CCL4 were expressed predominantly by neutrophils within the meninges early in the infection (12 h p.i.), and CXCL2, CCL3 and CCL4 were expressed by both neutrophils and monocytes by 24-48 h p.i. Furthermore, CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL2 were present in CSF from infected mice and in vitro antibody treatment with anti-CXCL2 or anti-CCL3 showed that these chemokines were partly responsible for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment, respectively. In light of the in vitro results it is interesting that the temporal expression of CCL3/CCL4, followed by CXCL2/CCL3/CCL4 is associated with a switch from a neutrophil-rich to a monocyte dominant immune cell environment. As we have seen, the in vivo inflammatory environment and in vitro model are often not correlated and can represent two widely distinct situations. The in vivo findings suggest that CCL3 is capable of either directly or indirectly recruiting neutrophils to areas inflammation, including the sites of bacterial-induced meningitis, once again emphasizing the importance of the dynamic regulatory networks that likely modulate chemokine and chemokine receptor function and signaling.",

It is most commonly transmitted to humans by an infected tick. Lyme borreliosis can also affect the CNS, generally manifesting as meningitis. In fact, other spirochetes have long been associated with CNS infection, including the causative agents of syphilis (Treponema pallidum) and leptospirosis (Leptospira) (Pachner 1986 ). In the case of borreliosis, host immune evasion is mediated through the ability of B. burgdorferi to constantly modify its surface structure by modulating lipoprotein expression. However, the surface structure of borrellia can also induce a strong and often damaging inflammatory response (Morrison et al., 1997) , which is mediated in part by chemokine expression. As we have seen, inflammatory changes in the CSF mediate breaching of the BBB and infiltration of immune cells within the CNS, causing subsequent pathogenesis. Indeed, the CSF of patients with neuroborelliosis contained significant amounts of CCL3, CCL4 and CCL8 compared to control patients (Grygorczuk et al., 2003) . Furthermore, human monocytes infected with Borrelia strongly expressed and secreted CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, CXCL1 (Sprenger et al., 1997 ). It appears that activated CD8 + T cells expressing the chemokine receptor, CCR5, may be directed to the CNS via these or other unidentified chemokines during the early phase of neuroborreliosis (Jacobsen et al., 2003) . Interestingly, CCR5 signaling on CD8 + T cells during Borrelia infection is also speculated to contribute to chronic autoimmune driven disease (Hemmer et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that is well known for causing food poisoning, skin infections and acute endocarditis (Murray et al., 2005) . It resides within the human nasal mucosa and/or the skin and is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and by sneezing. S. aureus is a common hospital-acquired infection and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus (MRSA) complicate effective drug treatment strategies. For example, S. aureus represents a significant nosocomial infection and is a prominent cause of brain abscesses, a disease that affects roughly 1 out of every 10,000 hospital-admitted patients in the U.S. (Kielian 2004a; Townsend and Scheld 1998) . In addition, S. aureus is able to survive intracellularly within neutrophils and endothelial cells further interfering with the success of hostimmune clearance (Gresham et al., 2000) . Chemokine signaling in response to CNS infection with S. aureus has been studied in a murine experimental brain abscess model. Using this model, Keilan, et al. (2001) demonstrated that CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL2 were expressed within 6 h post bacterial exposure. Microglia and astrocytes appear to play a prominent role in immune cell recruitment in this model system as the primary reservoirs for chemokine production and secretion. CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL2 were expressed on primary cultures of murine microglia and astrocytes infected with S. aureus (Kielian et al., 2001) , and microglia or astrocytes stimulated with heat inactivated S. aureus or gram-positive peptidoglycan expressed CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL10 (Kielian et al., 2002) , and CCL2, CCL4 and CXCL2 (Esen et al., 2004) . The functional role of chemokine signaling was further examined using CXCR2 ko mice, which had impaired neutrophil trafficking and increased bacterial burden within the CNS (Kielian et al., 2001) , indicating that CXCR2 ligands provide the main chemotactic signal driving neutrophil influx into the CNS. In addition, CXCL2 is chronically expressed in the experimental brain abscess model and correlated with continued infiltration of neutrophils in the presence of low bacterial titers within the CNS (Baldwin and Kielian 2004 ). It appears that CXCL2 expression in microglia is dependent on MyD88 signaling, suggesting that S. aureus-mediated microglia activation and chemokine production are dependent on TLR recognition, in part by TLR2 (Esen and Kielian 2006) . These studies indicate that CXCL2:CXCR2 signaling is the dominant cue for neutrophil recruitment to sites of S. aureus infection, which in themselves may be the primary mediators of CNS damage. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that induce tissue injury within the CNS it is of interest in the future to determine the functional importance of the other chemokines expressed during the course of S. aureus infection.",

Although functional redundancy is associated with many chemokine ligands as a result of receptor promiscuity, chemokine expression profiles often significantly shape the immune response to infection of the CNS based on various criteria including pathogen, route of infection, and cellular tropism. Careful consideration of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression during the course of disease could help in the derivation of treatments for patients infected with CNS invading pathogens with the ultimate goal of limiting inflammation/pathology without muting specific anti-microbial effector responses. Indeed, numerous treatments have been developed to control inflammation within the context of infection and autoimmune diseases by targeting specific proinflammatory molecules. With this in mind, various approaches are currently being developed and/or are in various stages of clinical trials to disrupt chemokine ligand interactions with specific signaling receptors with the hopes of improving disease outcome (Charo and Ransohoff 2006) . Given the relatively rapid pace at which our understanding of the biology of chemokines and chemokine receptors has progressed over the past decade, it is likely that successful clinical approaches will be developed to mute specific chemokine signaling pathways and improve clinical outcome in response to microbial infection of the CNS.",
