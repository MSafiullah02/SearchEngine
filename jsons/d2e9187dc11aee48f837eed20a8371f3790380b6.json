            "text": "I was not surprised that some of the earliest signs of COVID-19 outside of China were outbreaks on cruise ships. Several years ago, during a month on a 500-passenger cruise ship, I learned firsthand how rapidly viral infections can travel through those floating communities. I was the trip physician; the month was December; respiratory virus season had arrived early that year; and we unknowingly welcomed several unwanted guests when our passengers boarded in Nassau. Within two weeks over half the passengers were actively coughing and the clinic was inundated. On just one typical clinic day, I diagnosed three cases of Influenza A; eight patients with viral bronchitis; one case of pneumonia, and three cases of gastroenteritis. And this was a \"small\" voyage; more common are passenger lists at least five times larger! News headlines soon shifted from cruise ships to nursing homes. The canary in the coal mine was a five-star-rated home in Kirkland, Washington, 1 whose staff had the misfortune of being blindsided because they had no forewarning that COVID-19 was in the area when a cluster of febrile respiratory infections hit the facility, leading within two weeks to 23 deaths. 2 After that, the floodgates opened, such that as of mid-April over 7,000 deaths -a fifth of all U.S. COVID-19 mortality -were linked to skilled nursing facilities. 3 In New York, 72 long-term care facilities had five or more deaths each; in New Jersey, almost two-thirds of nursing homes had recorded COVID-19 infections; 3 and in Pennsylvania 55% of COVID-19 deaths were reported to have been among residents of nursing homes or personal care homes. 4",

Each is a densely-population congregate setting with cramped housing units that do not lend themselves well to sheltering in place. Each prepares meals in a central kitchen and serves them to large gatherings. Each sponsors activities that bring large groups together on a regular basis. Each has relatively large numbers of staff who have extensive contact with the residents and work under demanding conditions for modest pay. Each has medical resources that compete with other, non-medical priorities. Each has health care regulations that, while extensive, could not possibly have fully prepared them for COVID-19; instead, in the face of an impending outbreak, rapid, nimble responses were needed, and these have proven hard to initiate and coordinate in all three settings. Thus, each setting can be considered high risk for amplifying infectious diseases such as COVID-19, because the conditions that prevent disease dissemination are nearly impossible to achieve.",

Nonetheless, many states have acted to reduce bookings and/or to release persons who are older, have chronic disease, or have been jailed for nonviolent crimes. 9, 10 In California, noting that older inmates are at particularly high risk if they acquire the infection, a motion was filed to allow older inmates to be released even if they had been incarcerated for violent crimes. 11 No similar movement has taken place around discharging nursing home residents, despite significant family concerns and some recommendations that families look for alternatives. 12 Instead, most experts, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), do not recommend contemplating such moves, because acceptable living arrangements are not readily apparent. 13 A few families have taken independent action, particularly to bring post-acute patients home earlier than anticipated, but this has been infrequent. More common is the opposite situation -hospitals looking to discharge COVID-19 patients to nursing homes for post-acute care, and in response some nursing home units and entire nursing homes devoting themselves to COVID-19 care. These transitions, as well as outbreaks in the nursing homes themselves, place tremendous pressure on the nursing home industry to in short order develop the policies and procedures, provide the requisite staffing, and acquire the protective equipment and testing capacity that are necessary to safely manage COVID-19 patients.",

My population was relatively healthy, educated, and health-conscious; the average age was 52. I had numerous opportunities to provide public health messages about basic hygiene, which were understood and occasionally followed. The crew -largely minorities from the developing world who worked long hours -had minimal turnover and were meticulous in their work. Furthermore, cruise ships that visit U.S. ports are required to follow CDC policy recommendations and have their infection control processes inspected twice annually and the results posted publicly. 14,15 On the ship I held clinic twice a day; access was on an as-needed basis; and the ship provided nurses to support the medical clinic and conduct a wide variety of prevention and surveillance activities. The clinic's on-site testing included an influenza kit, a CBC, and an x-ray machine; so, while resources were limited, our diagnoses were immediate, and positive flu cases could be isolated within minutes after presenting to the clinic. On the other hand, the unavailability of many tests and the lack of ready access to referral resources came into sharp focus when, 48 hours away from the next port, a passenger in his 80's presented with incipient sepsis, having spent the previous 72 hours alone in his cabin awaiting spontaneous resolution of what proved to be bacterial pneumonia.",

Post-hospitalization admissions come daily, often bringing with them such subacute problems as delirium, gastrointestinal upset, pressure ulcers, and atelectasis. Shortages and rapid turnover of nursing and personal care staff create care challenges almost daily. Medical care providers are off-site most of the time and have competing responsibilities; 16 in consequence, decisions are often made over the telephone, with nursing staff assuming far more responsibility than they do in other health care settings.

And, while many staff show tremendous loyalty and perseverance in the face of a coronavirus outbreak, a COVID-19 outbreak leads to increased staff absenteeism due to the need for isolation among persons who become ill or from fear of contracting the disease, thereby worsening an already difficult staffing situation. 18 Shortages of personal protective equipment occur rapidly, without a clear avenue to obtain more, and access to testing is limited, with results often not returning for four or more days.",

Nursing homes have been known for years to be an especially hazardous component of the health care system, with high rates of multidrug resistance and multiple problems around infectious disease prevention. 27 Infection control issues have chronically been and continue to be the most common single reason for deficiency citations. 28 To help improve infection control practices, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2016 released new requirements for long-term care facilities, all components of which were to have been initiated by November 2019. 29 So, levying a punitive fine to a nursing home that had been previously cited for infection control violations would seem a reasonable reaction.",
