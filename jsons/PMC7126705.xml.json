This is important because some viral causes of enteritis also cause oral lesions.\u2022Assessment of hydration status and mucous membrane color \u2014 hydration status and color of mucous membranes (ocular, oral, and or vulva), including capillary refill time should be assessed.\u2022Abdominal palpation, auscultation, percussion, and succussion \u2014 abdominal palpation is practical in adult sheep and goats but unrewarding in adult cattle. Abdominal palpation may help identify evidence of pain or allow palpation of abdominal viscera. Simultaneous auscultation and percussion on the left and right abdominal wall help identify viscera filled with air, including the intestine. Succussion of the abdomen confirms the presence of excessive fluid in abdominal viscera, including the small intestine.\u2022Rectal examination \u2014 rectal examination is practical in cattle but may be delayed in cases of presence of a rectal prolapse (secondary to diarrhea). Rectal examination aids in identifying distended abdominal viscera, including small intestine, rumen, colon, or cecum. If not performed already, characteristics of the diarrhea (eg, color, odor, and volume of feces and presence of tenesmus, blood, mucus, or gravel) should be evaluated during the rectal examination and by evaluating feces on the rectal sleeve.\n",

Mixing of the fecal sample is easy in cases of diarrhea.5.Pour the mixture through a strainer or gauze into a 15-mL centrifuge tube. Add the float solution into the centrifuge tube so that the liquid is level with the top of the tube (forms a meniscus).6.Place a coverslip on top of the tube and centrifuge the tube at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes to 10 minutes. If the centrifuge does not have free-swinging buckets, the coverslip must be placed on the tube after centrifugation (otherwise it falls off during centrifugation). If a centrifuge is not available, the sample in step 5 is allowed to sit with coverslip in place for 30 minutes.7.Remove the coverslip and place on a glass slide and examine under the microscope at \u00d7100 [magnification] (\u00d710 ocular and \u00d710 objective).8.For qualitative assessments of microscopy of the coverslip, using routine slides is sufficient. For quantitative assessments, McMaster chambers are required.9.Other quantitative method techniques without the use of McMaster chambers have been described as follows: in step 4, mix 2 g of feces with 30 mL of the saturated sugar solution and follow through step 5. Follow step 6 but without placing the coverslip on top of the tube. Collect 0.15 mL of the centrifuged solution (solution making the meniscus), drop it on a routine slide, and place a coverslip. Count all the eggs under the coverslip at \u00d7100, then multiply by 200. This represents the approximate number of eggs per gram in the sample.\n",
