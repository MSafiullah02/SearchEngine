Objective: We wished to determine whether asthmatic children requiring emergency department treatment for exacerbations after school return in September were more likely to have respiratory viruses present and less likely to have prescriptions for control medications than children with equally severe asthma not requiring emergent treatment. Methods: Rates of viral detection and characteristics of asthma management in 57 (of 60) children age 5 to 15 years presenting to emergency departments with asthma in 2 communities in Canada between September 10 and 30, 2001, (cases) were compared with those in 157 age-matched volunteer children with asthma of comparable severity studied simultaneously (controls). Results: Human picornaviruses were detected in 52% of cases and 29% of controls (P = .002) and viruses of any type in 62% of cases and 41% of controls (P = .011). Cases were less likely to have been prescribed controller medication (inhaled corticosteroid, 49% vs 85%; P < .0001; leukotriene receptor antagonist, 9% vs 21%; P = .04). Conclusion: Respiratory viruses were detected in the majority of children presenting to emergency departments with asthma during the September epidemic of the disease and in a significant minority of children with asthma in the community. The latter were more likely to have antiinflammatory medication prescriptions than children requiring emergent treatment. Such medication may reduce the risk of emergency department treatment for asthma during the September epidemic. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;115: 132-8.) ",

Two of these studies 22, 23 compared cases with controls, one 22 with subjects without asthma presenting to emergency departments, and the other with subjects with asthma with no respiratory symptoms. 23 Although there were variations among the 3 studies in the rates of detection of respiratory infections, all were consistent in finding significantly higher infection rates in the children with asthma with exacerbations than in controls. We studied all children with asthma exacerbations presenting to emergency departments in a large population center in Canada at the time they occurred in the highly predictable peak period between September 10 and 30 and a control group of children with asthma of comparable severity not having an emergency department presentation during the same period. Our objectives were to determine whether respiratory viruses could be isolated with greater frequency from asthmatic children who required emergent treatment than from asthmatic children who did not, and whether access to asthma control medication differed between the 2 groups.",

In contrast, samples from controls were taken in a clinic setting by more experienced nurses with ample time. Cases were seen at a time when their likelihood of infection was greatest. Controls may have been positive at another time during the study period, which may have been undetected by us. Despite these issues, our results confirm that respiratory viral infections, particularly rhinoviruses, occur in a significant majority of children with asthma presenting to emergency departments with asthma, and show that they are present in a substantial minority of asthmatic children not requiring emergency treatment in the same period.",

Our interpretation of this finding is that it is likely that the vast majority of children returning to school encounter respiratory viruses, principally rhinoviruses, extremely frequently during this period. It is therefore not surprising that a substantial minority have detectable virus in clinical samples taken during this time. The comparable or possibly greater asthma severity in the controls suggests that disease severity per se is not a primary factor in the use of emergency departments for asthma exacerbations. However, fewer cases had asthma control medications (inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene receptor antagonists) prescribed, and hardly any used environmental control measures. The much greater reported previous rate of emergency department visits for asthma in the cases may be attributable to undertreatment as well. The controls had much less morbidity than cases, suggesting that their host response to viruses and/or their increased level of asthma control was preventing clinical illness. Similar studies investigating host responses and duration of viral carriage as well as viral loads in this context would yield further important information. Our finding that insurance claims for children's prescriptions for inhaled corticosteroids may be lowest in August immediately before school return raises the possibility that the September peak may in part relate to children using less controller medication immediately before the period when they may be at greatest risk of a viral-induced asthma exacerbation.",
