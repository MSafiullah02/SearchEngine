The horse is unique not only because of the longevity of the species and significant financial value of individual animals, but more importantly, because of the frequency with which horses are shipped between countries and between continents for various commercial purposes. In today's world, the horse can truly be considered no less an \u201cinternational jet-setter\u201d than its human counterpart. Changing trends in the equine industry worldwide have contributed significantly to the evolving nature of the international trade in equids, semen, and embryos and in the process have inevitably increased the risk of spread of various equine diseases. However, before elaborating on specific factors involved in the international dissemination of equine diseases in detail, it is important to appreciate the transformation that the equine industry in different countries has undergone over the past 40 to 50 years.",

The most significant factor in this development has been the favorable economic climate enjoyed by these countries over this period. National economics flourished from changes in the global market structure under various multinational trade agreements.5 Among the industries to benefit from the economic upswing has been the horse industry, with a resultant increase in the volume of international trade in equids and semen. The trend toward globalization of the horse industry received further impetus after establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 1995.6 The primary goal of the WTO is to promote freer economic exchange between member countries through reduction or elimination of protectionist barriers to trade.7\n",

Both impact studies dramatically demonstrated the major contribution of the horse industry to the national economy. In the 2005 study, the combined contributions of the direct, indirect, and induced effects of the industry (in terms of Gross Domestic Product) were assessed at more than $102 billion.8 The industry provides considerable employment, estimated at 1.4 million full-time equivalent jobs annually.

The number of highly prestigious and lucrative equine competitive events has proliferated around the world in the past 10 to 15 years.3 This is well illustrated by the increase in number of major equestrian events recognized by the International Equestrian Federation (FEI); these have nearly doubled over the past 8 years. Attracted by the considerable prize monies involved, owners are shipping their horses many thousands of miles, sometimes from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, or vice versa, to compete in international events such as The Breeders Cup, Dubai World Cup, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Japan Cup, Melbourne Cup, and Rolex Three Day Event. Transporting horses over significant distances for competition purposes has inherent risks (e.g., traumatic injuries, shipping fever). Nonetheless, the number of prestigious international events will likely continue to increase, with escalation in the volume of movement of horses, despite the health risks involved.",

Respiratory-borne diseases such as equine influenza, equine rhinopneumonitis, and strangles have been spread repeatedly between countries through international movement of horses (Table 69-1\n). Venereal transmission is also of major significance with respect to imported breeding animals, both stallions and mares, which may be carriers of specific pathogens (e.g., EAV, EHV-3, T. equigenitalis, certain serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, T. equiperdum). A further category of carriers are equids persistently infected with disease agents such as equine infectious anemia virus, B. equi, and B. caballi, which are primarily vector-borne infections but can also be transmitted iatrogenically. Besides the potential for many equine diseases to be introduced and effectively spread by respiratory, venereal, or vector-borne routes, agents can be transferred between countries by other means, which, although less frequently encountered, should not be overlooked. A limited number of pathogens (e.g., EHV-1 and -4, T. equigenitalis) can be introduced into a country through the importation of a pregnant mare that is harboring these organisms in utero. In such cases the potential for spread of these pathogens is at time of foaling.3\n",

However, experience has shown that failure to provide adequate postentry screening of equids for specific infections can pose an unacceptable disease risk for the horse industry in the United States or other importing countries.

All the animals involved were tested in the countries of origin and certified free of evidence of this bacterium.
