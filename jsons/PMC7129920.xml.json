            "text": "A seminal paper published in 2008 listed 335 new human pathogens discovered between 1940 and 2004 [1]. The majority (60.3%) of these emerging infectious diseases (EID) originated from (wild) animal reservoirs, and approximately one in five was transmitted from animal reservoir hosts to humans by disease vectors (ticks, mosquitos, midges) [1]. Pathogen discovery programs sampling wildlife hosts that are considered major reservoirs for EID (rodents, bats) have identified tremendous enzootic virus diversity, confirming their potential as sources of novel human pathogens [2]. Since 2008, the discovery of severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as unusual outbreaks of Zika virus, yellow fever and Ebola highlight the importance of demographic change, global travel and trade, and possibly climate change as drivers for emergence [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] (http://www.promedmail.org/, archive no. 20140322.2349696 2014-03-22). While the field is dominated by viruses from wildlife reservoirs, the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands, the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany and the ongoing vast cholera outbreak in Yemen are examples of bacterial pathogens that have expanded massively\u2014which is included in the definition of an EID (Box 1\n) [8], [9], [10]. There is broad consensus that we need to prepare for more EID in the future.Box 1Definition of emerging infectious diseases.Emerging infectious diseases are diseases that are newly recognized, newly introduced or newly evolved, or they are diseases that have recently and rapidly changed in incidence or expansion in geographical, host or vector range.Adapted from: World Health Organization (WHO), \u2018Diseases\u2019 (http://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/en/), and WHO, \u2018Emerging zoonoses\u2019 (http://www.who.int/zoonoses/emerging_zoonoses/en/).",

            "text": "A primary driver of EID comprises anthropogenic changes at the human\u2013animal\u2013ecosystem interface and the One Health paradigm. We live in a world with an increasing density of humans and a consequential increase in the demand for animal protein. This is supplied either by livestock farming or through natural resources (bushmeat and fish). Animal farming plays a crucial role in providing nutrition to the planet, and by itself it does not constitute a human infection risk. However, the environmental impact and the massive increase in the demand for animal protein do, and it has become clear that there are challenges in balancing the advantages of economic growth in a free market with public and ecosystem health. It is believed that today humans and livestock comprise 90% of the world's biomass, compared to 10% from wildlife, and also compared to 0.1% of the world's biomass in the Neolithic age [12]. This in part explains why so many EID have a zoonotic origin. A study by Wolfe et al. [13] categorized zoonotic diseases by their ability to spread among humans after a species jump into five stages, ranging from dead-end primary infections (stage 2) to human-transmissible zoonotic threats (stage 4) and ultimately to new fully human pathogens (stage 5) (Fig. 1\n).",

HIV is thought to have made at least ten entries into humans before stage 5 was reached [14]. The >2000 cases of MERS-CoV reflect multiple stage 2 infections, with occasional human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings (stage 3), whereas avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 infections are rarely transmitted among humans (stage 2) [15] (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/risk-assessment-july-2017.pdf). As an example of emerging parasites, Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite usually infecting macaque monkeys, has emerged during the past decade as a cause of human malaria in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaysian Borneo [16]. While the parasite causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in its natural host, in humans the disease can be fatal. Humans\u2014both locals and tourists\u2014entering the natural habitats of infected macaque monkeys are at risk [17]. The recognition of the importance of the human environment in the emergence of new diseases lies at the root of the One Health approach (Box 2\n).Box 2Definition of One Health concept.One Health recognizes that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. The goal of One Health is to encourage the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines\u2014working locally, nationally, and globally\u2014to achieve the best health for people, animals, and our environment.From: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, One Health (https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/index.html).",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) outbreak is believed to have been introduced into humans from civet cats sold for consumption at markets, which had acquired infection from the original reservoir, horseshoe bats [18]. Similarly, many of the Ebola outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of bushmeat, of which an estimated 4.5 million tons are sold from West and Central Africa alone every year (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3884/epdf). A risk assessment conducted by the European Food Safety Agency identified the sizeable illegal market in Europe as a risk factor for exposure to zoonotic pathogens [19]. The risk associated with this practice can change over time: the increase in monkeypox infections in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been linked to bushmeat consumption coupled with decreasing population immunity since the cessation of smallpox vaccination [20], [21].",

Since then, it has become clear that Nipah viruses can be transmitted among humans, and the continued occurrence of outbreaks linked to consumption of foods contaminated by fruit bat secreta is a cause for concern, as there is increasing evidence that Nipah virus may be transmitted via the respiratory route [23], [24], [25].",

The rapidly expanding scale and globalization of the food market\u2014while controlled through food safety systems\u2014is vulnerable, as a breach in the processes can lead to dispersed outbreaks that are difficult to chart. Bovine spongiform encephalitis emerged in the United Kingdom in 1986 after a change in the processing of animal feed including animal meal introduced the disease from sheep into cattle and subsequently humans [27]. In 2011, an outbreak of haemolytic uraemic syndrome due to a Shiga toxin\u2013producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli/enteroaggregative E. coli O104:H4, was detected in Hamburg, Germany, and cases were soon identified in several European countries [8], [28], [29]. The source was traced to a single producer of sprouts in Germany who used seeds produced and contaminated in Egypt [8]. A similar outbreak was reported from the United Kingdom, presumably from handling raw leeks and potatoes [30]. Multistate outbreaks in the United States of Cyclospora cayetanensis were linked to imported lettuce from a single manufacturer [31].",

Population growth and crowding provides increased opportunity for pathogen transmission. Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, with 50 000 people per square kilometer [35], had most cases of SARS-CoV. Despite the fact that the R0 of SARS-CoV remained well below 1, dispersal of virus-containing droplets and aerosols through a faulty sewage and plumbing system in the tightly spaced high-rise buildings led to a cluster of 330 cases [36]. The MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea is another example of the potential for human-to-human spread of an emerging coronavirus, in this case in the healthcare system, where close contacts in crowded hospital waiting rooms and the cultural practice of \u2018doctor shopping\u2019 facilitated spread [37]. Overcrowded healthcare facilities with long waiting times in hospital emergency rooms can be important hot spots for transmission of organisms, thus favouring the spread of emerging infections at the early stage of their appearance.",

A challenge, however, is how to keep primary care providers on alert when needed. The list of potential EID is daunting, routine diagnostic platforms mostly target specific known common diseases and a substantial proportion of disease episodes with possible infectious aetiology remains undiagnosed (Fig. 2\n). Syndromic surveillance coupled with extensive diagnostic assessment would be the way forwards. Novel platforms allowing for broad range of diagnostics are actively researched but are not yet widely accessible for routine clinical care, although this is likely to change in the coming years. An important question, therefore, is how enhanced surveillance and testing for unusual infectious diseases could be developed (Fig. 2). It is not realistic and not necessary to expand the diagnostic assessment on a routine basis. A more targeted approach may be the way forwards.",

The study concluded that it remains challenging to predict specific diseases, but it found increased likelihood of cross-species transmissions in specific regions [2]. For vector-borne diseases, prediction of regions at risk for outbreaks is done routinely in certain tropical regions. Clinicians in regions with high-density animal farming should include exposure to such farms in their history taking. The global threat alert systems operated by the World Health Organization, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and other organizations do provide a valuable source of information for preparedness for clinicians and diagnostic laboratories, but this system is only as good as the input it receives. A key challenge is represented by the fact that outbreaks outside industrialized countries are less likely to be rapidly identified, and easy access to advanced laboratory capability on every continent is urgently needed. The establishment of an African centre for disease control is most welcome, but it must be followed by investment in advanced laboratory capabilities [53]. Closer to home, surveillance should include veterinary partners, as is done, for instance, for avian influenza. Again, however, this is not necessarily fully developed: even though the most recent influenza pandemic originated from swine, pigs are susceptible to both animal and human influenza viruses and pandemic influenza viruses have evolved both in humans and in pigs with occasional reverse jumps, there is no routine surveillance of influenza in pigs to complement the pandemic preparedness system.",

Samples from severely ill individuals belonging to these sentinel groups without a clear diagnosis should rapidly (within days) be referred to reference laboratories. Europe has networks of diagnostic and research laboratories capable of diagnosing a broad range of rare zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, and of rapid deployment of assays for detection of EID, but there is room for improvement in linking these laboratories to primary clinical practice and in the sharing of essential information (Table 1\n).",
