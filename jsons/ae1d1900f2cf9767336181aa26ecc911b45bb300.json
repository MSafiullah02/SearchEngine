            "text": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heterogeneous group of myocardial diseases clinically defined by the presence of left ventriculardilatation and contractile dysfunction [1, 2] . Using the broadest definition of DCM would make the disease equivalent to heart failure since it would alsoinclude cardiac dysfunctionaftermyocardial infarction and through remodeling. In the Anglo-Saxon literature, ischemic cardiomyopathy is often mentioned. The classic definition of DCM Europe excludes coronary artery disease because its etiology is clear, whereas in idiopathic DCM the cause has yet to be further clarified. As such, a progression from viral myocarditis to DCM has long been hypothesized. Supporting this possibility, studies by endomyocardial biopsy for the definite diagnosis of myocarditis have provided evidence of inflammation and/or viral infection within the myocardium in patients with DCM, thus triggering the initiation or progression of myocarditis to postinflammatory DCM. Complementary to the recent reviews by Imanaka-Yoshida [1] and Maisch [2] , this contribution examines molecular and clinical data of the progression from viral and autoreactive (nonviral) myocarditis to DCM and offers perspectives beyond mere heart failure management to a treatment of the underlying cause.",

The combination of both methods made it possible, for the first time, to detect viral genomes directly within the affected myocardial tissue in patients with suspected myocarditis.

Comparable prevalence rates have been confirmed by others [33] , who also reported that persistence of parvovirus B19 in patients with left ventricular dysfunction was found to be associated with a progressive impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas spontaneous viral elimination was associated with a significant improvement in left ventricular function [33] . However, in contrast to enteroviruses, spontaneous virus elimi-nation of parvovirus B19 was observed in only a proportion of patients. These results suggest that persisting cardiac viral infections may constitute a major cause of progressive left ventricular dysfunction in patients with past myocarditis or DCM. In 24 patients who presented with acute-onset angina pectoris and STsegment elevations or T-wave inversion mimicking acute myocardial infarction but with normal coronary angiogram, the histological analysis excluded mostly active or borderline myocarditis. But instead B19V, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses genomes were detected in the myocardium of 12, three, and two patients, respectively [34] . In the autopsy study of a female patient with clinical signs of myocardial infarction and histopathological fulminant myocarditis, the presence of B19V genomes was exclusively located in endothelial cells of the smaller intramyocardial vessels. Immunohistochemical staining exhibited marked expression of E-selectin by endothelial cells, a finding indicative of endothelial dysfunction [35] . These findings may explain the fact that many patients with B19V-associated myocarditis present with the clinical signs of microangiopathy that are also typical of ischemic heart disease.",

This review focuses on the methodological advances in diagnosis in the past few years and exemplifies the importance of an etiologyorientated treatment in different case scenarios. In fulminant nonviral myocarditis, immunosuppressive treatment together with hemodynamic stabilization of the patient via mechanical circulatory support (e.g., microaxial pumps, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, left ventricular assist device) can be life-saving. For viral inflammatory cardiomyopathy, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment can resolve inflammation and often eradicate the virus.",

Investigation of autopsy material showed diffuse myocarditis with a granulocytic and monocytic infiltrate, necrotizing arteritis of the coronary arteries, and fulminant hepatitis with microvesicular steatosis and necrosis together with the detection of the HHV6 genome in heart, liver, lung, and spleen [45] . In the larger series of patients with in-flammatory heart diseases, analyses for HHV6 and EBV were always included. Prevalence rates for HHV6 genomes detected in patients with myocarditis or DCM ranged from 8 to 20% and for EBV genomes from 0 to 8%. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanisms of herpesviruses in acute myocarditis and especially the possible relevance of HHV-6 reactivation for the development of chronic cardiomyopathies remain to be assessed.

Many clinical faces of inflammatory heart disease coexist during different phases of the disease progression: Phase 1 is dominated by the viral infection itself, phase 2 by the onset of autoimmune reactions, and phase 3 by the progression to cardiac dilatation. In enteroviral myocarditis the infections phase was followed by an autoimmune phase, in which in humans both cellular-and antibody-mediated immune reactions played an important role.

To date, immunosuppression is contraindicated in viral myocarditis according to current guidelines. In the TIMIC study, virus was excluded by PCR. Only severely compromised myocarditis patients without demonstrable viral persistence in the biopsy could be included in this double-blind randomized trial [73] . The ejection fraction in the treatment arm comprising 43 patients increased from 26.5% at baseline to 45.6% after 6 months (p < 0.001). Accordingly, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and New York Heart Association class decreased significantly [73] . The ESETCID (European Study on the Epidemiology and Treatment of Cardiac Inflammatory Disease) is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled threearmed trial with prednisolone and azathioprine for autoreactive (virus-negative) DCMi in patients with an ejection fraction <45% at baseline. Its intermediate results from the immunosuppressive treatment arm demonstrated a positive trend in ejection fraction and major adverse cardiac events after 6 months of treatment and a significant benefit after 1 year of follow-up [72] . Remarkably, the control group without immunosuppres-sive treatment also showed some spontaneous resolution of the infiltrate.",
