The concentration of human infections has been linked to the local population of dromedary camels, which may serve as an intermediate host for MERS [10, 11]. The human-to-human transmission potential of MERS in the community at large appears to remain subcritical; however, outbreaks tend to be amplified via nosocomial transmission [9, 12, 13]. Case importation from the Middle East continues to represent a substantial risk for outbreaks, as recently exemplified by the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea. We concentrate on this large outbreak, sparked by a single index case who arrived in South Korea on 4 May 2015. The index case developed symptoms 7 days later and did not receive a diagnosis of MERS until 20 May 2015, after having sought treatment in several healthcare facilities [14].",

Systematic near real-time analysis of these online reports allowed reconstruction of MERS transmission chains, which can be considered a single giant cluster in this outbreak (Supplementary Figure 1) [18]. The full transmission tree comprised 150 cases linked to nosocomial events, where each case was classified according to occupational and social exposure. It became clear relatively early on that all cases were linked to exposure in the healthcare setting: 150 cases, included 107 hospital patients (including the index patient), 28 visitors or family members, 12 healthcare workers, and 3 nonclinical staff.",

Publicly available epidemiological data from the WHO were largely limited to aggregate weekly EVD case counts at the country level. In fact, this was the primary publicly available data set that many researchers around the world used to calibrate epidemic models. Subnational case data became available later and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in transmission patterns across West Africa, which could have affected epidemic forecasts and transmission potential estimates [22]. And at the time of this writing, >2.5 years after the onset of what may be one the most important outbreaks of the decade, detailed transmission chain data arising from official contact tracing efforts remain scarce and limited to a few clusters [20, 21, 23]. While our study is restricted by the amount of online information that could be processed manually, scaling-up would be possible with more-sophisticated computational tools that scour the Internet, social media, and other big-data streams to identify information on a larger set of transmission chains. These automatically sensed data sets could then be fed into modeling studies of the type we have shown here.",

The frequency of Ebola cases arising from funeral and hospital cases in our data peaked during the early months of the epidemic, which suggests that amplified transmission events in the healthcare setting and during funeral ceremonies facilitated the transmission of the virus across communities. Hospital exposures declined considerably after July 2014, likely as a result of the improvement in infection control measures in healthcare settings. Similarly, funeral exposures have occurred sporadically during the later containment phase of the epidemic. The decline in hospital-based transmission is in line with a decline in the proportion of healthcare workers in our data and statistics retrieved from the WHO situational reports [28].",

This pattern could result from a combination of factors, including changes in population behavior that mitigate transmission, characteristics of and spatial heterogeneity in the underlying network of contact over which the disease spreads, and control interventions. Standard compartment model theory stipulates that an outbreak should follow exponential growth before susceptible depletion or interventions set in. In contrast, a number of real epidemics have been shown to follow subexponential growth, with the effective reproduction number declining toward 1.0 in the first 3\u20135 disease generations, even in the absence of control interventions, depletion of susceptible individuals, or population behavioral changes [36]. The observed transmission patterns in EVD and MERS case clusters presented in this study, particularly the decline in the effective reproduction number over few disease generations, are in agreement with the subexponential growth rate behavior identified from population-level time series data [22, 37, 38] Temporal variation in exposure patterns and reproduction number should provide crucial information for the design and calibration of epidemic models particularly when these are intended to generate forecasts of the epidemic trajectory.",

For instance, news stories could be focused on survivor or sensationalist stories or could reflect an American-centric bias, with a higher coverage of news reports for countries that are more connected to the United States. Second, larger clusters tend to be included in news reports. Finally, the amount of information in each story or news report varies, with variables such as age and sex missing in the great majority of the clusters. Reassuringly, while our sample of case clusters extracted from Internet reports corresponds to just a small fraction of the total EVD case burden in the 3 most affected countries in West Africa, the broad epidemiological features of the Internet-based data (age, timing, and exposure) were well in line with summary statistics from health authorities.",

Other applications include HealthMap [39], a system that extracts epidemiological outbreak data from the Internet in near real time and has been used to analyze large-scale epidemics, such as the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti [40, 41]. Other studies have related temporal changes in the implementation of control interventions extracted from Internet reports with the trajectory of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (eg, variation in the reproduction number) [42]. Here we have provided further evidence that systematic collection and analysis of unstructured news from authoritative sources and surveillance reports may provide a reliable mean to assess epidemiological patterns in near real time. It is worth pointing out that translational research in this field has been slow or has not been properly recorded. Careful documentation and feedback from end users and stakeholders (eg, clinicians, policymakers, and public health officials) is warranted to foster further development and refinement of digital epidemiology tools.",

Moreover, our search focused on Internet reports and did not capture other digital data streams, including Twitter and other Web-based resources. Scaling-up the amount of information used would yield more powerful and potentially less biased analyses but would require design of novel computational tools to search, extract, analyze, interpret and visualize unstructured data from different sources. Highly flexible open source programs have been developed to scrape Internet data and could be the bedrock of such computational tools, especially in light of the rapid expansion of mining packages in R [43]. Yet the development of these tools poses several challenges related to the need for systematic and integrated search, extraction, and curation of diverse Internet data sets that contribute information about travel patterns, changes in social behavior, exposure settings, and healthcare demand and capacity. Moreover, the analysis tool kit could include the detection of critical events (eg, effects of interventions), sentiment analysis [5], and visualization of temporal and spatial epidemiological patterns. Other challenges in this process include the classification of large volumes of data with varying levels of reliability [39]. Clearly, further computational work and careful ground-truthing are needed to assess the potential of state-of-the art text-data-mining tools to compile information that can be used to model the dynamics of emerging and reemerging infections.",

B, Cluster 22 (Supplementary Table 1).

The guard then infected his son, whose mother denied that it was Ebola. This led to the rest of the family becoming infected. C, Cluster 47 (Supplementary Table 1). In October and November 2014, an imam developed symptoms in Guinea and then visited a family in Bamako, Mali. He went to a clinic and died there, infecting a nurse, physician, and all members of the family he stayed with.
