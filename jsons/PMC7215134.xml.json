The inhibitor of Influenza\u2019s polymerase Favipiravir is currently evaluated in a clinical trial in combination with anti-IL-6 receptor Tocilizumab (NCT04310228). Finally, the inhibitor of Ebolavirus\u2019 polymerase Remdesivir is currently evaluated in two major SIMPLE clinical trials (NCT04292899; NCT04257656) [8]. On Apr. 29, 2020 it was announced that results from the trial NCT04292899 showed clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients in 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group (https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/4/gilead-announces-results-from-phase-3-trial-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19).
