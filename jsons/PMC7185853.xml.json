Although such rhabdoviral-induced hemorrhages should include interferences with the host molecular coagulation pathways, those have not been explored yet. Therefore, we were interested in the study of transcriptional expression profiles along the coagulation-complement pathway induced by rhabdoviral early infections in the fish fins, their portal of entry [3], with the expectation of finding novel gene targets for preventive drugs. We chose the zebrafish Danio rerio because of its susceptibility to novirhabdoviruses like viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) [4], [5] or infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), coding for non-virion NV genes and to rhabdoviruses like spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) which lack the NV gene [6], [7]. In addition, zebrafish transcriptomic data on fins and lymphoid organs have been previously reported by our research groups after immunization with VHSV [8], [9] and SVCV [10].",

Activated THROMBIN cleaves blood FIBRINOGEN (fg) generating the fibrin clots characteristic of coagulation (Fig. 1\n). The coagulation cascades are interconnected with parallel proteolytic cascades involved in complement-dependent cell lysis. Thus, the \u201ccomplement and coagulation cascades\u201d KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) describes two proteolytic cascades interconnected by two proteins: FACTOR XII (endothelial secreted Hageman factor, coded by the f12 gene) and PLASMINOGEN (a pro-enzyme, coded by plg). Proteolysis of FACTOR XII/PLASMINOGEN increase PLASMIN to reduce coagulation by fibrinolysis and to increase complement-dependent cell lysis (Fig. 1). To avoid tissue damage, excessive proteolysis are controlled by a variety of protein inhibitors (i.e.: coded by serpind1, serpinc1, serpina1, serpinf2, serping1, serpine1, proc, tfpia, h, clu, etc). Among them, serine protease inhibitors (SERPIN proteins) could be grouped in those inhibiting, i) Coagulation by targeting THROMBIN coded by the f2 gene (SERPINd1, SERPINc1, SERPINa1); ii) Both coagulation and complement-dependent cell lysis by targeting TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR, coded by tpa or plaub (SERPINa1, SERPINe1) and/or PLASMIN (SERPINa1, SERPINf2); and iii) Complement-dependent cell lysis by targeting C1S/C1R, coded by c1s/c1r (SERPINg1) (Fig. 1, red).",

Because the lack of modulation (up or downregulation) of serpine1 could be explained by SERPINe1 interferences with VHSV infection, we then studied the effects of SERPIN specific inhibition on in vitro rhabdoviral infections. As demonstrated for human SERPINs [11], [12], to specifically inhibit zebrafish SERPIN activities, we used the orthologous 14-mer amino-terminal amino acids of its Reactive Center Loops (RCL) (NH2P14.P13.P12\u2026P3.P2.P1\u2026P'1.P'2.P'3\u2026P'12.P'13.P'14). Surprisingly, we discovered that only zebrafish SERPINe1-derived peptides and/or their corresponding specific low molecular weight inhibitors (i.e.: tannic acid, EGCG, tiplaxtinin) [13], [14] inhibited not only VHSV but also SVCV and IHNV in vitro rhabdoviral infections and reduced zebrafish mortalities of VHSV infections. This is one novel example of how the identification of host genes targeted by viral infections using microarrays might facilitate the identification of novel prevention drugs in aquaculture and illuminate viral infection mechanisms.",

Groups of 10 zebrafish were infected-by-immersion with VHSV or mock infected, as previously reported [8], [9], [10]. Briefly, zebrafish were maintained in 2 \u00d7 106 ffu of VHSV per ml at 14 \u00b0C during 2 h in 50 ml containers with continuous aeration and then released to their 2 l miniaquaria at 14 \u00b0C.

Extraction, labeling of high quality RNA and hybridization were performed as described before [8], [10]. Differential expression folds of genes of the \u201ccomplement and coagulation cascades\u201d KEGG pathway were compared from hybridization data deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE19049) [8]. Gene differential expressions or modulations expressed were calculated in folds by the formula, fluorescences of VHSV-infected zebrafish/mean fluorescences of non-infected zebrafish. Then the means \u00b1 standard deviations of the folds were calculated for n = 4. Genes with differential expression fold values > 1.5 or <0.66 were defined as statistically significant according to the one sample 2-tail independent t-test at p < 0.05.

To find the RCL sequences corresponding to zebrafish, P4.P3.P2.P1\u2026P1'.P2'.P3'.P4'. amino acid sequences (one single letter amino acid codes around the scissile P1\u2013P1\u2032 bound) of each human SERPIN were retrieved [12] and aligned to the corresponding amino acid sequences in zebrafish. Orthologous peptide sequences corresponding to the 14-mer amino-terminal part of each zebrafish RCL SERPIN were then obtained from the P14\u2026\u2026\u2026.P1 positions (Table 2\n). The 14-mer peptides were chemically synthetized by adding acetylation to its amino-terminal part as used before [11], [12].

SERPIN-derived peptides (Table 2) and/or SERPINe1 inhibitors [13], [14] were incubated overnight (\u223c16 h) with 300 ffu of purified rhabdovirus (VHSV, SVCV or IHNV) per well in cell culture medium 2% FCS, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 at 14 \u00b0C (VHSV, IHNV) or 22 \u00b0C (SVCV). ZF4 cell monolayers were then infected by adding the rhabdovirus + inhibitor mixtures during 2 h at 14 \u00b0C. Alternatively, SERPIN-derived peptides were incubated overnight with the ZF4 monolayers, washed and rhabdovirus added the next day during 2 h at 14 \u00b0C. After washing by flicking the plate and refilling with cell culture medium, rhabdovirus-infected cell monolayers were incubated overnight at 14 \u00b0C before being fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) during 20 min and permeabilized with 0.05% Saponin, 0.01% N3Na in PBS during 15 min. To detect rhabdoviral infection, the VHSV N protein was stained with MAb 2C9 [22], SVCV with a polyclonal Ab anti-SVCV (Bio-X Diagnostics) and IHNV with a mixture of anti-N MAbs [23]. The virus-specific Abs were diluted in 2% FCS, 0.05% Saponin, 0.01% N3Na in PBS (permeabilizing buffer) and rabbit FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was used to fluorescently label the bound Abs. The monolayers were suspended by 10 min incubation with 0.25% trypsin 0.02% EDTA (Sigma, St.Louis, MS, USA) and pipetted after the addition of 1% BSA, 50 mM EDTA, 0.01% N3Na in PBS. The suspended cells were analyzed in a BD FACS Canto II apparatus (Beckton Dickinson, San Agustin de Guadalix, Madrid, Spain) provided with a high throughput sampler. Forward (FSC) and side (SSC) scatter threshold values corresponding to damaged cells, cellular debris and/or cellular aggregates were eliminated from the analysis. The number of fluorescent cells was determined over a threshold containing 95% (mean + 2 standard deviations) of non-infected cell controls (>50% of the cells infected). The BD FACSDIVA software calculated the percentage of fluorescent (N-positive, VHSV-infected) cells by the formula, 100 x number of cells with fluorescences > the threshold/total number of cells per well (n = 10,000 cells). Comparisons with the fluorescent values from infected cell monolayers without any peptide treatment were performed by using the Student-t test at the p < 0.05 level.",

Tannic acid was delivered to zebrafish either by mouth with a micropipette or by adding it to the feed. To deliver tannic acid fish-to-fish by mouth, groups of 10 zebrafish per treatment per experiment were moved to 14 \u00b0C aquaria and 3 days before the VHSV challenge were individually given 10 \u03bcl of PBS containing 50 \u03bcg of tannic acid each day by mouth with a micropipette. Mock-treated zebrafish were similarly given 10 \u03bcl of PBS each day per fish. To prepare the feed with tannic acid, commercial flakes (Tetramin, Tetra GMbh, Germany) were weighted and dissolved in water, 10% w/w of tannic acid added and mixed with an homogenizer. The mix was then dried at 37 \u00b0C during 2-days and kept at 4 \u00b0C until use. Groups of 10 zebrafish per treatment per experiment were moved to 14 \u00b0C aquaria for acclimatation and fed with 20 mg of feed containing 10% of tannic acid per day during 3 days before and 7 days after VHSV challenge. Mock-treated zebrafish were similarly fed with 20 mg of feed each day per fish with feed prepared in a similar way but without tannic acid. In both cases, after tannic acid treatment, the groups of fish were moved to 50 ml containers and infected-by-immersion with aeration with 107 ffu/ml of VHSV during 120 min. Mock-infected zebrafish were incubated with cell culture medium in parallel experiments. From 1 to 15 days, fish were monitored for mortalities 2\u20134 times a day and those with external hemorrhages and alterations in swimming were euthanized by an overdose of MS222 (methanesulfonate 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester) to minimize their suffering. After 15-days, the survivor fish were also euthanized by an overdose of MS222. Cumulative percentage mortalities for each group of 10 fish and treatment were calculated by the formula, 100 x number of fish that die after 15-days/10. Means of cumulative percent mortalities and its standard deviations from 3 different experiments for each treatment were then calculated. Means significantly lower at the p < 0.05 level (Student t test) when compared to the PBS or feed control group (*).",

A more detailed analysis of the corresponding gene-by-gene differential expressions in the above mentioned pathway, showed that more genes were modulated in fins (60.9%) than in lymphoid organs (17.1%) (Table 1).

Only serpine1 remained not modulated, in sharp contrast to the rest of serpins in the fins (Table 1, bold). These data suggested that serpins as well as other genes coding for inhibitors in this pathway (i.e. proc, h), may be upregulated by the VHSV infection to favor viral spreading by increasing hemorrhaging and delaying complement-dependent cell lysis, except serpine1.

To inhibit SERPIN activities, we used 14-mer synthetic peptides derived from the orthologous human/zebrafish SERPIN RCL loops (Table 2), since they demonstrated highly specific inhibition of SERPIN activities in mammals [11], [12]. Fig. 2\nA (black circles) shows that only the peptides derived from SERPINe1 inhibited VHSV infection in a concentration-dependent manner (50\u2013250 \u03bcM) when peptides and VHSV were incubated before being added to the cell monolayers. The rest of the SERPIN-derived peptides did not show any inhibition compared to VHSV-infected cell monolayers in the absence of any peptide (Fig. 2A open symbols). Because similar results were obtained when the SERPIN-derived peptides were added to the cells and washed before the addition of VHSV to the cell monolayers (SERPINe1 in Fig. 2A, black rectangles), the interactions of SERPINe1 inhibitory peptides must occur inside the cells rather than with VHSV virions. On the other hand, the absence of inhibition by other SERPIN-derived peptides was not due to lower cell penetrating activities because they have higher or similar predicted cell penetrating probabilities [24] (Table 2). In view that only the SERPINe1-derived peptide inhibited VHSV infection, we focused the rest of the experiments in exploring its possible practical applications. In addition, the SERPINd1-derived peptide having no effects on VHSV-infectivity was chosen as a negative control.",

However, none of these shorter peptides inhibited VHSV-infection when tested in a similar range of molar concentrations than the 14-mer SERPINe1-derived peptide. In contrast, simultaneously assayed 14-mer SERPINe1-derived peptide inhibited VHSV-infection (not shown). These results showed that the high specificity of viral inhibition by the SERPINe1-derived peptide required at least half of the 28-mer RCL sequence. Thus, despite their lower molecular weight and therefore their higher permeability, smaller SERPINe1-derived peptides were not capable of inhibiting VHSV-infection. Because the SERPINe1-derived 14-mer peptide requirement is highly specific, their inhibition of SERPINe1 cleavage is the most probable explanation for its mechanism of action, such as demonstrated before in mammals [11], [12].",

We found that VHSV infectivity was inhibited by all the low molecular weight drug inhibitors tested at concentrations \u223c50-fold lower than the SERPINe1-derived peptide and lower than those causing ZF4 cytotoxicity (Fig. 3\n). Therefore, since both the SERPINe1-derived peptide and SERPINe1 specific drug inhibitors inhibited VHSV-infection, an unknown serine protease X needs to be inhibited by SERPINe1 for successful VHSV infectivity. Thus, when SERPINe1 was inhibited, inhibition of VHSV infectivity was observed because the protease X inactivated VHSV infectivity. While unknown SERPINe1-targeted protease(s) X might be implicated in these mechanisms, other possible candidates are TPA, PLAUB and/or PLASMIN (Fig. 1). Although we have no evidences to favor any of these possibilities, PLASMIN, is a serine protease not only implicated in fibrinolysis but also in many other matrix protein breakdowns [25], which could include some of the rhabdoviral proteins. On this respect, serpine1 knock-out mice has shown that serpine1, tpa and plg are implicated in controlling coronavirus infections in mammals [26]. However, in coronavirus [26] and in yellow fever [27] infections, serpine1 levels were upregulated contrary to what occurred in fish rhabdoviruses. We can speculate that a dramatic fighting between host and rhabdovirus could exist to control serpine1 transcript levels during the initial course of fish rhabdoviral infections. Thus, if serpine1 levels are downregulated, VHSV infection will be inhibited but host hemorrhages will increase. On the contrary, if serpine1 levels become upregulated to increase VHSV infection, host hemorrhages will be inhibited thus reducing the opportunities for viral spreading. During the first 2-days after infection, serpine1 transcriptional levels remained not modulated (Table 1) because those 2 opposite effects.",

Since initial experiments showed that a maximum of 50 \u03bcg of tannic acid could be administered to adult zebrafish without inducing any mortalities during the following days, that daily dose was delivered fish-to-fish by mouth. Therefore, 50 \u03bcg of tannic acid was administered per 2.5 g of fish per day during 3 days, corresponding to a total dose of 60 \u03bcg per g of fish. A similar dose of tannic acid of 68 \u03bcg per ml (\u223c40 \u03bcM) caused \u223c 95% inhibition of VHSV infectivity in vitro (Fig. 3). After being challenged with VHSV, 15-day mortalities of tannic acid-treated zebrafish were 52.3 \u00b1 4.2% while those in the absence of tannic acid treatment were 80.0 \u00b1 8.8% (Fig. 4\n). We then added 10% of tannic acid to the feed and fed zebrafish with feed containing 200 \u03bcg of tannic acid per fish per day during 10 days, corresponding a total dose of 800 \u03bcg per g of fish.

Serpin upregulation would inhibit many of the downstream serine proteases of that pathway confirming the immunosuppressive early effects of many viral infections including fish rhabdoviruses [7], [8], [10], [28], [29], [30]. In contrast to the rest of serpins in this work, and in contrast to its upregulation in solid tumors [31], viral-induced hepatocarcinoma [32], and coronavirus [26] or yellow fever [27] infections in mammals, serpine1 levels remained not modulated during fish rhabdoviral infections. To explain serpine1 not modulated levels, we hypothesized on the existence of conflicting interests of SERPINe1 with fish rhabdoviral infectivity, since highly specific inhibition of VHSV infectivity was obtained in vitro with a 14-mer peptide derived from SERPINe1 and other specific drugs but not with those peptides derived from other SERPINs. In addition, drugs targeting SERPINe1 such as tannic acid, successfully but partially reduced mortalities to rhabdoviral infections of zebrafish in vivo. This is an example of how the identification of host genes targeted by fish rhabdoviral infections obtained by using expression microarrays, offered an alternative to explore possible drugs for seasonal prevention of these diseases. Further work could allow for higher reduction of VHSV infection with low molecular weight drugs in larger fish.",

ZF4 cell monolayers were incubated overnight with SERPIN RCL-derived synthetic peptides (Table 2) previously incubated with VHSV, SVCV, or IHNV. To detect rhabdoviral infection, the VHSV N protein was stained with MAb 2C9 [22], SVCV was stained by a polyclonal Ab anti-SVCV (Bio-X Diagnostics) and the IHNV N protein was stained with a mixture of anti-N MAbs [23]. After staining with their corresponding FITC-labeled anti-viral antibodies, the suspended ZF4 cells were analyzed with a high troughput sampler in a BD FACS Canto II apparatus.
