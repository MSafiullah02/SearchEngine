The yeast two-hybrid system was originally developed to identify and study protein-protein interactions (1,2). This method was later expanded to allow detection of interactions between proteins and RNA (3), proteins and nonprotein ligands (4), proteins and peptides (5), proteins and multiple partners (6,7), and whole-genome applications (8-10). In addition, some investigators have begun to study the potential of two-hybrid screens to detect protein-small-molecule interactions (11) (12) (13) . However, limited progress has so far been made to adapt such yeast screening technologies for the identification of new clinical candidates in high-throughput screens (HTSs).",

In particular, a network of regulators associated with the phenotype known as pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR), which closely resembles the mammalian multi-drug resistance phenotype (MDR) (16), is known to affect cellular transport and drug resistance. Pdrlp and Pdr3p, members of the C6 zinc cluster family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, redundantly modulate expression of ABC transporter proteins by inducing their transcription (17, 18) . Disruption of PDRI and PDR3, the genes encoding Pdrlp and Pdr3p, respectively, results in decreased expression of the ABC transporter PDR5, and thereby increases drug sensitivity of pdr1 \u2212 pdr3 \u2212 cells (19) . Further, it has been shown that overexpression of either the HXT9p or HXT11p hexose transporter proteins independently promotes drug sensitivity, by increasing uptake of certain drugs (19, 20) . Based on these earlier studies, we have exploited these properties of PDR and HXT mutants to create hyperpermeable yeast strains useful for HTS for the two-hybrid system. We here describe the creation of these strains and their utilization for the selection of small-molecule inhibitors of interaction between Ras and Raf oncoproteins. ",

Both parental SKY191 and modified SKY197 strains showed no sensitivity to SMM at all concentrations tested. However, based on the size of the death zones, SKY197 is significantly more sensitive to CYH and 4-NQO than SKY191 on YPD media (Fig. 6) . Further, when the SKY197 yeast were incubated on Gal/Raff-containing media (thereby inducing expression of HXT9 and HXT11 genes), their sensitivity to CYH and 4-NQO increased. The estimated increase of death-zone diameters for 4-NQO for SKY197 on YPG/R media in comparison with the parental strains grown on the same media was approx 32-40%. After 48 h of incubation on YPG/R media, sensitivity to CYH was estimated to be 0.01 \u03bcg/mL minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in comparison to 0.5 \u03bcg/mL for the parental strain. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration (micrograms per milliliter of broth) that inhibited visible growth, disregarding a haze of barely visible growth. Sensitivity to CYH of a yeast strain harboring PDR1 and PDR3 deletions, and with the HXT11 gene overexpressed from a multicopy plasmid, was previously reported as having an MIC of 0.03 \u03bcg/ mL CYH (19) . Thus, integrating inducible copies of HXT11 and HXT9 into the chromosome while deleting pdr1 and pdr3 significantly increased the sensitivity of yeast cells to the tested compounds (see Note 4).",

Yeast containing an independent interacting protein pair, DBD-fused-hsRPB7 and AD-hsRPB4, were similarly plated in parallel in both strains, as a control to be used for detection and subtraction of toxic compounds. These strains were used to screen a library of 73,400 compounds applied in microarray format. A representative panel demonstrating specific vs nonspecific inhibition of growth is shown in Fig. 7 . From 3009 compounds that produced growth-inhibiting effects in the SKY54 CI-H-Ras-AD-Raf-1 strain, 708 compounds also reduced \u03b2-galactosidase activity, with varying degrees of selectivity for Ras-Raf-1 vs hsRPB7-hsRPB4 on plates. Significantly fewer positive colonies were detected in the screen performed for Ras-Raf interaction inhibitors in the SKY48 yeast strain (data not shown). Further assessment of the selectivity of interaction inhibition by liquid beta-galactosidase assay (29) identified 38 compounds that produced a clear reduction (with a final range of 3-45% of starting values) in LacZ activity in SKY54 expressing H-Ras and Raf-1, but not LexA-hsRPB7 and AD-hsRPB4, when included in culture medium at concentrations of 30 \u03bcM.

Our choice of the hisG DNA fragment from Salmonella, cadBA gene from E. coli, and the Int gene from the HIV virus was based on the lack of sequences homologous to these DNA sequences in yeast. Thus, the chromosomal integration of the expression cassettes was directed to the specific sites intended (PDR1, PDR3) through homologous recombination. The specific DNAs we have used can be successfully replaced in integration cassettes by other DNA sequences that have no or low homology to yeast genomic DNA. 2. GAL1 was chosen as a promoter because of its strength and inducible nature. Further, comparison of the yeast sensitivity to the given compound on media supplemented with glucose (YPD) vs galactose (YPG) allows unequivocal estimation of the contribution of the HXT9 gene to the reduction of resistance phenotype. 3. We found that the Ura3p enzyme synthesized from the first integration cassette is present in the yeast cells at the time of addition of 5FOA compound even in the cells with a successful second cassette integration and elimination of an active copy of URA3 gene. The activity of these remnants of Ura3p causes the conversion of 5FOA into a toxic metabolite, and subsequent cell death. Additional propagation of the yeast on the YPD media, rich in exogenous uracil, is sufficient to significantly reduce the level of the earlier synthesized Ura3p enzyme in the cells with successful recombinations, and escape from 5FOA-related toxicity. 4. The absence of improved sensitivity to SMM and Zeo in the modified SKY197 strain indicates that the enhancement of permeability is not universal, but limited to some compound classes, likely reflecting differences in the uptake and efflux mechanisms for different drugs.",
