The N-terminal part of this S protein, known as S1, is responsible for attachment to host cells, while the C-terminal part mediates virus fusion to host cells postattachment (1). For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the S1 protein comprises four individually folded domains, designated S1A through S1D (2, 3). Two of these domains, S1A and S1B, are involved in binding to host cell surface molecules during the attachment phase. The S1A domain preferentially binds to several glycotopes of \u03b12,3-sialic acids, while the S1B domain recognizes a host exopeptidase named dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the viral receptor (4, 5). The absence of DPP4 renders cells insusceptible to MERS-CoV (4). Meanwhile, elimination of sialic acids in susceptible cell lines significantly reduces MERS-CoV infection (5). These findings indicated that besides DPP4, the functional entry receptor of MERS-CoV, \u03b12,3-sialic acids act as attachment receptors (4, 5).",

It is expressed in the nasal epithelium of camelids, pigs, and rabbits, in which MERS-CoV causes upper respiratory tract infection (6\u201312). In the human respiratory tract, it is mainly expressed in type II pneumocytes in the lungs (8, 13), in line with clinical data showing that in humans, MERS-CoV mainly replicates in the lower respiratory tract (14\u201316). In common pipistrelle bats, a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV-like viruses, DPP4 is scarcely detected in the respiratory tract but abundantly present in the intestinal tract (17). Accordingly, MERS-CoV-like viruses are detected mostly in fecal samples of this species as well as in other insectivorous bat species (18\u201320). Sheep, on the other hand, do not seem to express DPP4 in their respiratory tract and thus hardly shed infectious virus and did not seroconvert upon experimental intranasal MERS-CoV inoculation (7, 21). Epidemiological studies did not reveal MERS-CoV-seropositive sheep in the field, except for one study using sheep sera obtained from Senegal (22\u201325). Altogether, these data support the role of DPP4 in determining the host range and tissue tropism of MERS-CoV.",

These molecules are mainly present in the lower respiratory tract epithelium of humans and the upper respiratory tract epithelium of dromedary camels, in line with the localization of DPP4 (5, 26). However, it is important to note that MERS-CoV S1A does not indiscriminately bind to all \u03b12,3-sialic acids. It does not recognize those with 5-N-glycosylation or 9-O-acetylation but preferentially binds 5-N-acetyl-modified sialic acids (5). Among these \u03b12,3-linked, N-acetyl-modified sialic acids, MERS-CoV S1A predominantly binds to short, sulfated, \u03b12,3-linked monosialosaccharides and to long, branched, di- and triantennary \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids, with a minimum extension of 3 N-acetyl-d-lactosamine tandem repeats (5). These glycotopes were previously identified by glycan array analysis using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1A (5). Here, using these nanoparticles, we developed a histochemistry-based technique to map the MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes in the tissues of different susceptible species. The results of our study offer further insight into the importance of these glycotopes in MERS-CoV host range, tropism, and transmission.",

Recent studies revealed that these tissues also express \u03b12,3-sialic acids based on Maackia amurensis lectin II binding (5). However, this lectin binds to a broad range of modified \u03b12,3-sialic acids and thus may not represent a specific marker for glycotopes recognized by MERS-CoV S1A (28). In order to map these glycotopes, we displayed MERS-CoV S1A in a multivalent manner using 60-meric self-assembled nanoparticles generated from the lumazine synthase protein of the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (np-S1A) (5) and subsequently used these nanoparticles to set up a histochemistry assay. We previously showed that both np-S1A and MERS-CoV virions can agglutinate human erythrocytes, while dimeric MERS-CoV S1A cannot, indicating that multivalent presentation is necessary for the hemagglutination phenotype of MERS-CoV S1A. Similarly, np-S1A, but not dimeric MERS-CoV S1A, can bind to tissues in our assay. As shown in Fig. 1, np-S1A binds specifically to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels. We found that these glycotopes are expressed in clusters of ciliated and goblet cells in the nasal epithelium in a random multifocal pattern (Fig. 1A). We determined the binding specificity of np-S1A by using blank nanoparticles and tissues pretreated with neuraminidase as negative controls (Fig. 1A). Goblet cells, however, are DPP4 negative and thus are not susceptible to MERS-CoV despite expressing these glycotopes (Fig. 1B). The nasal tissues used for the np-S1A binding experiment, DPP4 detection, and periodic acid-Schiff staining were obtained from noninfected dromedary camels, while those used to visualize both np-S1A binding and MERS-CoV nucleoprotein were obtained from MERS-CoV-infected dromedary camels. The tissues of these animals were collected during a previous study (27).",

We rescreened this library using the S1A domain and identified an S1A-reactive nanobody. We confirmed its specific binding to the S1A domain through S1, S1B, and S1A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). While the control nanobody (29) was negative in all three ELISAs, each of the anti-S1A and anti-S1B nanobodies reacted specifically to its corresponding domain and to S1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The identified S1A nanobody inhibited np-S1A binding to nasal epithelial cells, whereas the S1B-reactive nanobody did not, further confirming the np-S1A binding specificity and the potential role of S1A-specific antibodies in blocking MERS-CoV attachment (Fig. 1A).",

However, both pigs and rabbits shed less infectious virus (mainly between 102 and 103 50% tissue culture infectious doses [TCID50]/ml) than do dromedary camels (between 104 and 105 TCID50/ml) postinoculation (6, 7, 9\u201311, 27, 30). In line with these findings, we found smaller numbers of infected nasal epithelial cells in the nasal tissues of these MERS-CoV-infected pigs and rabbits than in dromedary camels (Fig. 2). Using the nasal tissues obtained from mock-infected dromedary camels, pigs, and rabbits, we show that DPP4 is highly expressed in the nasal epithelium of these three species (Fig. 2), indicating that the differences in infectious virus shedding observed in these three species are not likely due to differences in DPP4 expression. Subsequent screening for the presence of \u03b12,3-sialic acids in these tissues using lectin histochemistry revealed that the nasal epithelium of pigs does not express these sialic acids, in accordance with the results of previous studies (31, 32). In contrast, these sialic acids were detected in the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels and rabbits (Fig. 2). We then used np-S1A to test for the presence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits and found that unlike dromedary camels, both species do not express these glycotopes (Fig. 2). The absence of these glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of rabbits, despite the abundant presence of \u03b12,3-sialic acids, further supports the fine specificity of A domain binding.",

It has also been shown to mediate entry of pseudotyped viruses expressing spike proteins of two MERS-CoV-like viruses, i.e., HKU4 and Hypsugo pulveratus BatCoV HKU25, in target cells (19, 35, 36). DPP4, detected using a previously described immunohistochemistry method (8, 17), has also been shown to be abundantly expressed in the intestinal epithelium of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats (17). Altogether, these studies suggest the susceptibility of various bat species to MERS-CoV-like viruses. However, not all susceptible bat species may act as hosts for these viruses, as they were preferentially detected in insectivorous bats (18\u201320). One study conducted a large screening of over 5,000 insectivorous bats, from Ghana, Ukraine, Romania, Germany, and The Netherlands, showing that these viruses were mainly detected in Nycteris bats and pipistrelle bats (20). Using np-S1A, we investigated whether MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes were differentially expressed in the intestinal epithelium of insectivorous bats, i.e., common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and serotine (Eptesicus serotinus) bats, and frugivorous bats, i.e., Gambian epauletted (Epomophorus gambianus) and Egyptian fruit (Rousettus aegyptiacus) bats. We observed that np-S1A binds to the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats in both villi and crypts, while in others, np-S1A binds only to the intestinal crypts (Fig. 3).",

In line with these observations, DPP4 is expressed in the lower airway epithelium but not in the upper airway epithelium. It was detected in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells but primarily in type II pneumocytes (Fig. 4A), consistent with previous studies (8, 13). Our lectin histochemistry staining showed that both bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes express \u03b12,3-sialic acids (26). Both cell types also express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes, as indicated by the binding of np-S1A (Fig. 4B). Using immunofluorescence, we show that DPP4 expression and np-S1A binding colocalize in the same alveolar epithelial cells in the human lung (Fig. 4C).",

            "text": "The function of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes as an attachment factor thus far has been observed only in Calu3 cells, which is a cell line originating from a human lung adenocarcinoma. These cells express both DPP4 and the glycotopes of \u03b12,3-sialic acids recognized by MERS-CoV. Removal of sialic acids on these cells using neuraminidase prior to MERS-CoV infection significantly reduced the number of infected cells (5). In contrast, neuraminidase treatment of Vero cells, which do not express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes, had no effect on the number of infected cells (5). Primary well-differentiated normal human bronchiolar epithelial (wd-NHBE) cells also express DPP4 and MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes (Fig. 5A). These wd-NHBE cells were obtained from healthy human bronchial epithelial cells and cultured at the air-liquid interface to mimic the human airway environment. Previous studies have reported that these cells are susceptible to MERS-CoV in a DPP4-dependent manner (38\u201340). Here we show that neuraminidase treatment of paraffin-embedded wd-NHBE cells reduces np-S1A binding but not DPP4 expression (Fig. 5A). Neuraminidase treatment prior to MERS-CoV infection of these cells also significantly reduced the number of infected cells (Fig. 5B), similar to our previous findings in Calu3 cells (5). Thus, our results further support the importance of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes as an attachment factor during infection of human airway epithelial cells.",

            "text": "The S1 protein is an important determinant for the host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses. This domain initiates infection by binding to host cell surface molecules, either proteinaceous, sialoglycan based, or both (41). The S1 proteins of feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenterovirus, and MERS-CoV have been demonstrated to have dual-binding specificity, allowing them to engage both sialoglycans and proteinaceous molecules (5, 38, 41\u201345). We have previously reported that for MERS-CoV, this dual binding is facilitated by distinct domains of its S1 protein, i.e., S1A and S1B (4, 5). The S1B domain binds DPP4, the functional receptor of MERS-CoV (38). DPP4 has been demonstrated to have a major influence on viral host range and tropism since its tissue localization varies between species (7, 8, 13, 17, 33, 38, 46\u201348). It is detected in the nasal epithelium of camelids, pigs, and rabbits (7, 8). In bats, it is mainly expressed in the small intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle and serotine bats and in both the respiratory and intestinal epithelia of Gambian epauletted and Egyptian fruit bats (17). Meanwhile, in the human airways, it is present merely in the lower respiratory tract epithelium, particularly in type II pneumocytes (8, 13). Besides DPP4, MERS-CoV preferentially binds \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids via its S1A domain and uses these sialic acids as an attachment factor (5). Using nanoparticles displaying a multivalent S1A domain, we show that the tissue localization of these glycotopes varies between various tissues in susceptible species. The S1A domain bound to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels and type II pneumocytes in human lungs but not the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Binding of particles to other molecules besides sialic acids such as mucus and extracellular factors that are removed during the preparation of tissue sections as a result of the boiling procedure, however, cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV-inoculated pigs and rabbits shed less infectious virus than did dromedary camels (6, 7, 10, 11, 27). In addition, these animals did not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes (30, 49). In contrast, MERS-CoV is easily transmitted among dromedary camels (12, 50\u201353). The absence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits might render them less permissive to MERS-CoV, thus shedding less infectious virus, which subsequently limited virus transmission. This is supported by our finding that the loss of these glycotopes, e.g., through desialylation, could significantly reduce MERS-CoV infection (5). However, it is important to note that the expression of other factors, such as proteases and interferons, may also influence MERS-CoV replication and transmission. MERS-CoV has been reported to use host cell proteases, such as TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsins, to mediate fusion to host cells (54\u201356). The virus has been shown to be sensitive to type I interferon, an essential host innate immune cytokine (5, 54\u201358). Thus, the absence of these proteases and the presence of an inhibiting host innate immune response could effectively limit MERS-CoV replication and transmission, in combination with the absence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes (5, 54\u201358). The importance of glycotopes in MERS-CoV transmission, either solely or in combination with other factors, remains to be further elucidated. These studies would likely require experimental infection of camelids, particularly dromedary camels (50, 51, 59, 60).",

This finding further supports the belief that insectivorous bats are one of the natural hosts of MERS-CoV-like viruses (18\u201320) and also suggests that not all insectivorous bats express the \u03b12,3-sialic acid glycotopes recognized by MERS-CoV in their intestines.

Periodic acid-Schiff staining was performed by deparaffinizing and hydrating the tissue slides, subsequently incubating them in a periodic acid solution for 5 min and Schiff\u2019s reagent for 15 min, and counterstaining them with Gill\u2019s hematoxylin for 1 min, with water rinsing between steps. This protocol has also been used in our previous study (7). Expression of \u03b12,3-sialic acids was detected using biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) at a 1:800 dilution and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at a 1:300 dilution, both diluted in 1\u00d7 Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 M MnCl2, 1 M MgCl2, and 0.1 M CaCl2, and then subsequently visualized using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and counterstained with hematoxylin. Detection of S1A binding on the tissues was performed using nanoparticles displaying a multivalent S1A domain (np-S1A) and a Strep-tag generated in a previous study (5). The tissues were boiled in 10 mM citric acid buffer (pH 6) for 15 min and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) before staining with 3 \u03bcg/ml np-S1A overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues that were stained with an equal concentration (3 \u03bcg/ml) of blank nanoparticles and those that were pretreated with 800 mU/ml neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C were used as negative controls. Additional controls were performed by staining tissues with np-S1A previously incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with either anti-S1A, anti-S1B, or control nanobodies at a 15-\u03bcg/ml concentration. These nanobodies were obtained from a nanobody library generated in a previous study (29). These tissues were subsequently stained with rabbit anti-Strep-tag sera generated in-house and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), each at a 1:100 dilution, for 1 h at room temperature and then visualized with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence staining, fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in the experiment, i.e., goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), both at a 1:250 dilution, with a 1-h incubation at room temperature.",
