The shutdown is particularly rapid and severe in infections of cultured cells by picornaviruses, some poxviruses, and herpesviruses, all of which are rapidly cytopathogenic. With other viruses (e.g., adenoviruses) the shutdown is later and more gradual, while with noncytocidal viruses such as arenaviruses and retroviruses there is, by definition, no shutdown and no cell death. Some viruses (e.g., flaviviruses) are cytocidal, even though they do not shut down cellular protein synthesis very well, indicating that this is not the only mechanism involved.",

This type of cell-virus interaction is found in vertebrate cells infected with several kinds of RNA viruses: arenaviruses, retroviruses, and some paramyxoviruses, for example. In all these infections virions are released by budding from the plasma membrane of the cell. Although such virus-yielding cells may grow and divide in culture for long periods, there are slow, progressive changes that ultimately lead to cell death, except with retroviruses. In the animal, cell replacement occurs so rapidly in most organs and tissues that the slow fallout of cells due to persistent infection may have no effect on overall function. However, persistently infected differentiated cells may lose their capacity to carry out specialized functions (see below). Also, antigenic changes are produced in the cell membrane of persistently infected cells. In the animal, such changes may provoke an immunological response, which can rapidly lead to destruction of the cells (see Chapter 10).",

In cultured canine kidney cells, influenza and parainfluenza viruses mature by budding from the free apical surface, but vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus) and some retroviruses bud from the basolateral membrane. In each case the site of maturation is determined by the site of insertion of the viral glycoprotein into the plasma membrane, which is in turn a function specified by its nonglycosylated precursor. As discussed in Chapter 4, the precise nature of the \u201czip code\u201d that determines the destination of any particular glycoprotein is unknown, but it may be of great functional significance in vivo. Viruses that mature at the apical surface of glandular epithelial cells are shed into the environment, whereas those maturing at the basolateral surface presumably move to other sites in the body, perhaps entering the bloodstream and establishing systemic infection. An example of this phenomenon in vivo is the polarized budding of rabies virus in the salivary gland, from the apical end of mucous epithelial cells into the salivary duct (see Plate 10-3).",

Herpesvirus-infected cells acquire a capacity to bind immunoglobulin nonspecifically, because of the synthesis of herpesvirus-coded proteins with the properties of Fc receptors in the plasma membrane; this, in turn, may lead to the destruction of the cell by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

All mammalian species have complex families of genes encoding different subtypes of interferon a, and one or two interferon \u03b2 genes (except in cattle, which have multiple genes for interferon \u03b2). Nonmammalian vertebrates have interferon \u03b2 genes but no interferon \u03b1 genes. Interferon \u03b3 is not induced by viral infection per se, but by lymphocytes following antigen-specific (or mitogenic) stimulation. It is really a lymphokine, which is regularly produced during the response to viruses in vivo (see Chapter 9), but not by virus-infected cell cultures. Its functions are chiefly immunoregulatory, although it does have some antiviral and antitumor activity.",

Some interferons, especially \u03b2 and \u03b3, display a certain degree of host species specificity; e.g., rabbit interferons are ineffective in mice or humans. However, there is no viral specificity, e.g., interferons induced by a paramyxovirus are effective against a togavirus or any other sensitive virus.

One can think of interferons as lymphokines, induced principally by viral infection, and playing a key role in the regulation of the immunological response to that virus (see Chapter 9). Interferons secreted by virus-infected target cells, as well as by lymphocytes, macrophages, and NK cells, activate Tc lymphocytes, macrophages, and NK cells in the immediate vicinity to develop their cytotoxic potential, while also enhancing the expression of both class I and class II MHC antigens on the surface of the cells with which such leukocytes interact. In turn, these effector cells not only destroy the target but produce more interferon following contact with viral antigen on the cell surface. The consequential cascade greatly amplifies the lytic arm of the immune response. Yet it is apparent that other important arms of the immune response are depressed by interferon, perhaps reflecting the propensity of interferon to inhibit the replication of lymphocytes. A full analysis of this complicated issue must await careful in vitro studies of the various actions of purified preparations of each cloned subtype of interferon on cloned populations of well-characterized lymphocyte subtypes. Armed with that knowledge, it should then be feasible to go back to the whole animal to document the biological relevance of each of the diverse effects of various interferons.",
