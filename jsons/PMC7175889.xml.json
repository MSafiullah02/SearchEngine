They enabled not only more efficient triage of the increasing volume of possible COVID-19 patients but did so while importantly protecting our health care providers and complying with \u201csocial distancing.\u201d Additionally, telemedicine served as a tool for specialty providers to help offload primary care providers, urgent care clinics, and emergency departments of other acute and chronic issues that could be managed without their involvement. This allowed primary care and emergency room providers to focus on the higher acuity COVID-19 patients as well as prevent overcrowding of their facilities. The realities that enabled the ease with which the transition to virtual care took place in the United States are multifactorial but can be broadly categorized into three buckets. First, the infrastructure for telemedicine was readily available in the United States as digitized clinical records could be accessed remotely through secure portals. Second, new state and federal regulatory guidelines removed the last enduring barriers to the widespread adoption of telehealth platforms by changing the payment models. Third, the venture capital invested into telemedicine start-ups over the past decade has enabled a ready, able and vibrant ecosystem to exist. As reported by Mobile Health News, the amount of capital invested in digital health in the first half of 2019 alone was over $1.5 billion and capped many years of progressively increasing funding for the sector.",

In person scribe services were already common in clinics where the administrative burden of documentation was perceived to be untenable. Many practices had to quickly pivot from the in-person scribe model to utilizing virtual scribes on telehealth platforms. These virtual scribes, like their in-person counterparts, can document visits in the EHR and free the provider to engage with the patient on the online portal. The virtual scribes log into the visit and have access to everything the clinician sees and hears. Digital scribes are joining the party as well. Virtual digital scribes are software programs that take advantage of the rapid advances in the branch of artificial intelligence (AI) devoted to voice recognition. Coupled to complex ontologies trained on hundreds of thousands of medical articles, these algorithms can listen to a natural conversation between the patient and the clinician and create the equivalent of a clinical note, place it in the chart, and even provide an evaluation of the note for billing. Simpler programs can take and transcribe a dictation.",

For example, if a patient asks about a \u201cheadache\u201d, \u201cpain between the ears\u201d, or \u201cthrobbing in the head\u201d the chatbot understands all three to be referring to a headache.

These tools are excellent for screening patients for symptoms, checking on medication adherence, or to follow up on symptoms, and can be based either on text, voice, or email [3].",

The University of California San Francisco designed and deployed an employee screening chatbot that decreased hospital entrance times from 30 minutes to less than one minute. There are many companies currently offering chatbot services to manage everything from patient scheduling to collecting patient reported outcomes.

For example, no piece of data would have been more important or valuable in this pandemic than the accurate, up-to-date number of COVID-19 cases in the country, ideally broken down by geographic region. Yet, an accurate count of COVID-19 cases has not been available making forecasting the spread of the pandemic particularly difficult [7]. The lack of this seemingly rudimentary data point (the number of new cases over time) further made machine learning and artificial intelligence, both much touted technologies of our day, powerless. This evolving story drives home the point that data is king, and that getting accurate, unbiased data in real time is paramount and that in the absence of accurate and sufficient data predictive models are, at best, an educated guess.",

Flattening the curve means spreading out new cases over time so that the health system is not overwhelmed. and the affected population buys time to ramp up testing and develop vaccines and treatments. During that window, the system can provide more and better data to optimize the models and inform decisions to fight and manage the pandemic [8]. The elegance of the phrase, \u201cflattening the curve\u201d is difficult to overstate. It has proven to be a life-saving concept that was born in data and then successfully packaged into a simple phrase and infographic that concisely explained what the problem was to decision makers and the general public alike. It lent credence and context to the phrases that explained what to do about the problem (e.g., \u201csocial distancing\u201d and \u201cshelter in place\u201d) and their impact. The story of this data-derived-insight turned public-health-meme is still unfolding but may truly go down as one of the great public health triumphs of our day. One moral of the story is the importance of taking our data-derived insights across the \u201cfinish line\u201d. Data, technology and a good analysis alone don\u2019t go far enough: we must make the data do something by translating insights into effective policies that induce behavior change if we are to achieve the desired outcome.

In general, machine learning based approaches are helping scientists to target their efforts to those areas most likely to meet with success as opposed to squandering time on experiments that are less likely to be fruitful. For example, machine learning has helped scientists predict chemical properties of drugs and proteins [9], predict vaccine immunogenicity [10], identify promising drug targets [11], and even identify existing drugs that have the potential to be repurposed for use against other pathogens [12]. It remains to be seen if these advancements will be successfully applied to the discovery of treatments and a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The exciting potential of machine learning is perhaps best exemplified by AlphaFold, a machine learning based system that has demonstrated a remarkable ability to predict the 3D structure of proteins based solely on genetic sequence [13]. Understanding how these proteins \u201cfold\u201d allows scientists to design drugs that recognize and target those unique antigens. The AlphaFold group has already released the predicted structures of several under-studied proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 in hopes that these structural predictions will contribute to the scientific community\u2019s understanding of how the virus functions and serve as a starting point for future experimental work aimed at developing therapeutics [14].",

VR provides users with immersive, interactive experiences in computer generated environments through the use of a headset and body motion sensors and typically, hand controllers, in the current generation of commercially available platforms. VR and AR can deliver sophisticated simulations and immersive environments for remote physical therapy and surgical training. VR has shown benefits in resident training in multiple orthopedic subspecialties. In a recent study, Logishetty et al. demonstrated several benefits of VR for surgical resident training for direct anterior approach total hip arthroplasty on cadaveric specimens. Trainees exposed to VR training demonstrated less need for guidance or intervention, more accurate component orientation and were faster surgeons compared to the non-VR group [20]. A follow up study by the same group demonstrated reduction of surgical errors and improvement in efficiency of movement in the operating room compared to a baseline assessment after only 4-5 hours of VR training [21]. The latest versions of these platforms allow collaborative modes, where surgical teams can practice procedures together online without physically being in the same location. With elective orthopedic surgical procedures on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, VR may provide trainees, surgeons and even surgical assistants an avenue to learn and maintain proficient surgical skills, all at an acceptable social distance.",
