Given the high risk of contamination of front-line emergency medicine personnel, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical. There are generally two approaches to training exercises -focused training with periodic refresher courses or just-in-time training. The cost burden of preparing for high-risk, low-frequency events such as CBRN incidents is a significant challenge since it places a financial and personnel/time burden on hospitals [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, training exercises tend to focus on donning and doffing PPE, and not procedural competence while in PPE.",

While there is also conflicting evidence regarding the impact of ultrasound on intravenous (IV) cannulation, there are no studies that address its use with PPE [13] [14] .

However, we felt strongly that this should be included since preparing equipment requires manual dexterity that is influenced by PPE, and in an emergency situation, this preparation will likely be done while donned. Unfortunately, there is limited and somewhat conflicting literature that addresses the question regarding the appropriate time needed to successfully complete airway tasks by otherwise procedurally competent personnel while wearing PPE [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In our study, the median times for successful intubation with DL and VL (including preparation for intubation), regardless of the use of PPE, were 67 seconds and 89 seconds, respectively. We feel that a time under one and half minutes for preparation and successful endotracheal intubation is an acceptable timeframe.",

Although it was not a statistically significant finding, it was interesting that the median times for IV cannulation were faster with PPE than without PPE. Castle et al. found an increase in the mean completion time of IV cannulation when wearing PPE Level C (40.8 sec vs. 129.6 sec) [6] . MacDonald et al. found a statistically significant increase in completion time for IV cannulation when wearing PPE (158 sec vs. 220 sec, P < 0.01) [7] . There has also been no previously established appropriate time for IV placement using PPE; however, the median time for IV cannulation with ultrasound using PPE was 98 seconds. We feel that successful IV cannulation under two minutes is an appropriate time frame.",

As a result, we were unable to parse out subtle differences in proficiency that might occur across varying training levels. Second, we did not track the time taken for each individual stage of the procedure; that is, specific time for preparation, time from the insertion of the laryngoscope to passing the ETT and lung inflation. This would have been beneficial in making a direct comparison of our results to existing literature. Finally, while our participant group of trainees completed the procedures in what we consider an appropriate time frame, future studies should include a group of experienced clinicians so that a \"gold standard\" can be introduced for comparison.",

Maintenance of existing skill proficiency while wearing PPE is a key finding and perhaps obviates the need for continuous, skills-focused PPE training. A safe and cost-effective strategy might be to conduct basic, justin-time PPE training for personnel who have maximal proficiency in the relevant emergency skill.",
