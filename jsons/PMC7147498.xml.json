            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense and single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause a number of respiratory diseases in mammals [1,\n2]. In the last two decades, two beta coronaviruses were responsible for the epidemic outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases. The first outbreak\nwas caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) while the later epidemic was related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\n[3,4]. The global mortality rate for SARS-CoV was 9.6% and 34.4% as documented for MERS-CoV, death was the\noutcome of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organs failure [5,6]. Respiratory\ndiseases caused by CoVs is believed to be the result of zoonotic transmission from specific animals [7]. Genomic sequencing studies suggest that\nthe potential zoonotic reservoir of SARS-CoV is bats while camels are thought to be a probable vector or reservoir for MERS-CoV [8,\n9]. In December 2019, multiple cases of unknown viral pneumonia had been reported in Wuhan, China. By that time, most of the patients were living\nor working near a local seafood market [10]. Genomic sequencing of patients' specimens collected from lower respiratory tract had revealed the\nimplication of unprecedented type of coronavirus, which was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [11]. Analysis of next generation\nsequencing data has showed that 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a genomic identity of 79% and 50% respectively [12]. According\nto WHO situation report of February 27, 2020, the current epidemic outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV has a global distribution that affects 47 countries. The confirmed cases of\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are 82,294 and most of them are living in China, the reported number of deaths is 2,804 [13]. Pneumonia cases of 2019-nCoV had clinical features very\nsimilar to those reported with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. COVID-19 patients were presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnea and bilateral ground-glass opacity and consolidation of chest as seen\nin CT images. Unlike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, patients with 2019-nCoV had rarely showed signs of enteric disease like diarrhea. Also, few COVID-19 patients had presented with upper respiratory\ntract symptoms like sore throat and rhinorrhea [11,14,15]. The transmission mode of 2019-nCoV may be similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV through airborne droplets and contact with infected\npersons [13]. The mean incubation period is estimated to be 5 days with 95% confidence interval range of 4-7 days [16].\nLike SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV may use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a potential receptor for host cell infectivity [17]. Currently, no antiviral\ntherapy or vaccine is available against coronavirus infection and attempts in this trend are accelerated to combat current epidemic outbreak [7,\n11]. On February 6, 2020, worldwide protein data bank has established COVID-19 coronavirus resources to facilitate target based drug design efforts\nagainst current global threat [18]. As listed in COVID-19 coronavirus resources, a crystallization team in Shanghai Technical University was able to\nresolve the structure of main protease for 2019-nCoV [19]. The three-dimensional representation for the monomer of 2019-nCoV main protease as deciphered\nfrom 6LU7 crystal can be seen in (Figure 1). The main protease (Mpro), also less commonly known as 3CL protease, is believed to be essential for coronaviruses\nreplication cycle through posttranslational processing of RNA replicase machinery [21]. The Mpro is usually present as a homodimer, many coronaviruses\nshare a significant homology regarding three-dimensional structure and amino acids sequence of this proteolytic enzyme. Therefore, Mpro represents a conserved molecular target to design a broad\nspectrum anti-CoV drug [22]. It is of interest to study the binding features of 1615 FDA approved drugs with the recently known 2019-nCoV main protease\nstructure having high sequence homology with that from SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "By using 2AMQ crystal for SARS-CoV Mpro as a reference, we were able to successfully align and superimpose 6LU7 crystal for 2019-nCoV main protease. According to (Figure 2),\nboth 6LU7 and2AMQ crystals are well superimposed. The only significant overlap deviation can be noticed in the C-terminus region for these two crystals. For simplicity of illustration,\nonly chain A was considered for alignment and superimposition. These two superimposed crystals were then aligned according to residues spatial proximities.(Figure 3)\nreports sequence alignment output for 2019-nCoV Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro. These two crystals are very well aligned with identity percentage of 93.79. These results fall in favor of previous\nstudies indicating that the main protease enzyme is highly conserved in many coronavirus members, therefore this proteolytic enzyme may be used in structure-based screening studies to design\na broad spectrum anti-CoV drug [22,23]. Then by employing DoGSiteScorer grid-based tool [25],\nwe were able to detect several potential binding pockets within chain A of 2019-nCoV main protease crystal. Here, we have reported only the first three pockets in (Table 1),\nthese binding pockets are ranked according to their size, surface area and druggability score. The first pocket is the preferred binding site for N3 inhibitor as reported in many crystallization\nstudies of CoVs Mpro [19,22,23]. The location of pocket one was used\nas coordinates for our grid box setup and docking analysis. These predicted binding pockets within 6LU7 crystal are also well illustrated in (Figure 4).\nThe chemical and clinical characteristics for the top ten hits with the least binding energy (docking score) are listed in (Table 2). These FDA approved\ndrugs were ranked according to their minimum binding energy to 2019-nCoV main protease. According to this table, four of these drugs are anticancer agents. Due to safety concerns, they have\nbeen neglected from further analysis in this study. We also ignored Perampanel and Loxapine from our consideration due to their significant central nervous system effect. We have chosen\nboth Conivaptan and Azelastine for further molecular docking and dynamics analysis due to their relative safety [41] and thereby they may be repurposed.\nMolecular dynamics (MD) analysis is computationally demanding process; therefore we have focused only on Conivaptan and Azelastine to save our limited computational power. The chemical\nstructures for these ten drugs are shown in (Figure 5). Molecular docking images show the predominant involvement of different hydrophobic interactions\nbetween ligand (Conivaptan or Azelastine) and amino acid residues of 2019-nCoV main protease. The only exception is the formation of a hydrogen bond between glutamine 189 residue of Mpro\nand Conivaptan. The two-dimensional image for docking analysis of Conivaptan and Azelastine against Mpro crystal is shown in (Figure 6). It is evident\nthat Conivaptan has more interactions with Mpro active site than does the Azelastine. The ligand-protein complex with least binding energy pose was saved as PDB file for MD simulation.\nAccording to potential energy plot in (Figure 7), both Conivaptan-Mpro complex and Azelastine-Mpro complex were stable during equilibrium phase. Based\non MD analysis report, Conivaptan has more interactions with Mpro active site residues than does Azelastine during simulation period. Most of these interaction bonds are hydrophobic. These\nresults can be seen in (Figure 8), which fall in agreement with findings of docking studies. Ligand proximity to active site residues of the target\nmay indicate stronger binding. In this regard, both Conivaptan and Azelastine were able to maintain low ligand movement root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) that didn't exceed 3.25 Angstrom\nas seen in (Figure 9). Superposing the receptor on its reference structure generated this plot. Finally, the analysis of molecular dynamics has shown\nthat Conivaptan may undergo more conformational changes as compared to Azelastine during simulation time. (Figure 10) shows ligand conformation root-mean-square\ndeviation (RMSD) by superposing the ligand on its reference structure.",
