Demands on the wild sources of traditional medicinal products are increasing as human populations grow inexorably and poorer countries are forced to decrease spending per capita on Western health systems. On the other hand, Western populations are turning to more traditional and homeopathic products, and their demand for natural remedies is increasing (IUCN 2000). Additionally, some species are in danger of extinction due to a combination of factors independent of the growing global demand for traditional medicines and other natural products.",

We hope to stimulate further discussions about this use of biodiversity and its implications for wildlife conservation.",

Fever could be treated with ground frog heads (Hendricks 1966, p. 44), and whooping cough with a soup made from nine frogs (Hendricks 1980, p. 109). Heart trouble was treated with ground-up toad skins (Hendricks 1980, p. 8). Also, newts are often burned to ashes and then used in medicinal formulas and concoctions since ancient times (Gomes et al. 2007). Alakbarli (2006), highlighted that amphibians were not used in medicine as widely as reptiles, but mentioned that four species of amphibians described in medieval sources have been identified. This group includes frogs, toads, salamanders, and tree-frogs (Hyla arborea).",

Reptiles and amphibians are commonly used in healing through the magical transfer of disease, one of the most engaging subjects in the whole field of folk medicine (Hand 1980). In some situations, it is believed that the mere contact with an animal is sufficient for the disease to pass from the victim to the animal. In Ontario, for example, the mere touching of a live frog to a goiter is sufficient to make the malady pass into the frog; however, final curing depends upon burying the hapless critter head down in the ground until it decays. When this happens the goiter will disappear. Tying or binding a live frog to the affected part will cure a felon, will cause chills to go out of the patient into the frog, will cure asthma, and, in a North Carolina example, spells resembling the hard ague. In the Blue Grass country a live toad is bound to the back to cure rheumatism, the pain passing from the back of the sufferer into the toad (Hand 1980). In Northeast Brazil, jabutis (Chelonoidis carbonaria) are usually bred as pets because it is believed that they protect the household from acquiring asthma (Alves et al. 2011).",

These observations are corroborated by Brasil (1937) and Giorgi et al. (1993), who noted that analgesic drugs have been extracted from the venom of Crotalus durissus. Batroxobin, extracted from the venom of Bothrops atrox, has been found to have significant therapeutic effects on ischemic-reperfused rats in vivo and in clinical trials, and batroxobin, as well as ancrod, is currently being commercially produced. Three other thrombin-like enzyme preparations are also commercially available: reptilase, crotalase, and an enzyme derived from Agkistrodon contortrix (Bell and Markland 1997). However, wider clinical use of thrombin-like enzymes has been impeded by immunologic reactions in patients, limited availability of snake venoms, and high production costs as well (Warkentin 1998).",

It has been documented that people sometimes resort to traditional home remedies as a means of resisting urban modern medicine and of asserting their traditional culture (Alves et al. 2007b; Boltanski 1989; Ngokwey 1995). In China, for example, the demand of turtle in traditional medicine is fueled by deeply held cultural beliefs (Rubio 1998).",

In several Brazilian cities, for example, snakes are widely traded in outdoor markets (that can even have designated stalls for medicinal animals and plants) or in small stores specifically dedicated to this activity (Alves and Pereira Filho 2007; Alves and Rosa 2010). In Mexico, natural and traditional remedies derived from reptiles (such as dried rattlesnakes, rattlesnake pills, and rattles) are frequently offered for sale (Fitzgerald et al. 2004). Turtles, snakes, and lizards (especially monitor and gecko lizards\u2014Fig. 7.4) are widely hunted and traded in Vietnam for food and as traditional medicines (Jenkins 1995; Le and Broad 1995; Nash 1997; Stuart 2004). Somaweera and Somaweera (2010) documented the use and trade of snakes in snake wine in four of the most touristic cities in Vietnam. He and Peng (1999) reported that the quantity of snakes consumed in the markets of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China, was about 1.4 \u00d7 107 kg each year. From 1990 to 1995, the annual demand for wild snakes from 13 factories producing traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) included 1,656.77 kg of Zaocys dhumnades, 234.75 kg of Deinagkistrodon acutus, and 20,300 heads and 32.1 kg of Bungarus multicinctus (Zheng and Zhang 2000). These examples illustrate the urgent need to increase our knowledge concerning the harvesting and trading of reptiles in traditional medicine and to assess the impacts caused by this commercial exploitation.\n",

Asia has a high diversity of turtle species, but its unique fauna is facing a perilous and uncertain future. The main reason for the Asian turtle survival crisis is Chinese demand for turtle products (van Dijk et al. 2000). Directly or indirectly, the medicinal value attributed to chelonians has been one of the main reasons for their trade and overexploitation. In China, turtles are sought as a delicacy because of widespread popular belief, inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine, that turtle meat or shell possesses especially nutritious or curative properties (Lau and Shi 2000). Such situations demonstrate that cultural aspect should be taken into consideration in the elaboration of conservation plans. A study conducted in China showed that the same (or better) nutritional benefits of turtles can be obtained with cheaper, common, and less-endangered food sources such as domestic animals (Rubio 1998). These authors concluded that given the financial and environmental cost of using turtle products, other options for obtaining the same nutrition should be promoted and that future challenges should involve balancing cultural practices with sustaining biodiversity.",

This use of the herpetofauna represents an additional pressure for many species, and for others this has been indicated as an important cause of population decline. Thus, not only should one consider the use of these animals in popular medicine but also their exploitation by the pharmaceutical industry. As pointed out by Shaw (2009), any pharmaceutical scientist who is involved in contemporary natural product research has to get involved in or at the very least become familiar with the global issues of species conservation and/or biodiversity.",

Hence, an understanding of the cultural, social, and traditional roles of the herpetofauna is essential for establishing management plans directed toward sustainable use. As recorded in this work, medicinal use of the herpetofauna, despite being widely disseminated, has been studied little, limiting the evaluation of the impact of these practices on animal populations. Therefore, studies in ethnoherpetology are essential in conservation strategies and to record associated knowledge of such uses.",
