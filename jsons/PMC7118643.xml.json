The abductive reasoning (or inference) process was used for this study. It is a type of logical inference which starts with a set of observations and then searches for the simplest and most likely explanation for the observations. In our case, the most likely explanation is exponential growth. This process yields a plausible conclusion but may not always positively verify it. The abductive conclusions are heuristics (see [1]), hence involve uncertainty, which is expressed by the bounded rationality as satisficing. Satisficing is a decision making process which takes into account the costs of optimization into the optimization process, thereby producing an efficient but suboptimal result. This can be compared with maximizing, which produces an optimal result at the expense of suboptimal costs.",
