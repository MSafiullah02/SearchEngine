In 2008, another epidemic affected South East Asia, including Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.16, 17, 18, 19 Apart from mortality and morbidity, outbreaks occurring in school settings caused significant social disturbance to children, their families and teachers. In large school outbreaks of HFMD or outbreaks associated with EV71 in Hong Kong and Singapore, the Health Authority may have to suspend classes or close schools in order to prevent disease transmission.18, 20\n",

When large community outbreaks occur, public health actions including increasing public awareness, vigilance of personal and environmental hygiene, and social distancing may be necessary to stop disease transmission. A sensitive surveillance system is therefore essential for early detection of community outbreaks in order to guide public health actions. In Hong Kong, HFMD was added to the sentinel surveillance system (SSS) in 1998. The main objectives were to monitor HFMD trends in Hong Kong and to enable early detection of community epidemics, which in turn helps to initiate timely preventive measures. The SSS includes over 100 sentinel clinics, including approximately 40 general practitioners (GPs) and 60 general outpatient clinics (GOPCs). GPs are doctors who practice in the private sector while GOPCs are public outpatient clinics. They are all distributed throughout the territory.",

These data, in aggregated format, are sent to the Department of Health (DH) by facsimile or e-mail using a standardized surveillance record form. A weekly summary report is disseminated to all participating doctors. The authors evaluated the performance of the SSS in order to identify areas for improvement.",

The HFMD consultation rate was calculated by dividing the number of patients diagnosed with HFMD by the total number of patients seen. The positive viral culture rate was calculated by dividing the weekly number of specimens positive for enterovirus by the weekly total number of specimens performed. The enteroviruses included Coxsackie A and B, EV71, EV68, echovirus and some untyped enterovirus. Coxsackie A24 was excluded because it was associated with acute conjunctivitis instead of HFMD. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the weekly consultation rate with the positive viral culture rate was calculated. The HFMD consultation rate from the SSS was plotted on a monthly basis to document seasonal trends. HFMD cases were broken down by age group to determine the most susceptible group.",

A key step in these calculations was determining the epidemic and non-epidemic weeks by setting a threshold level. When the consultation rate or viral culture rate was above the threshold in a particular week, it was considered to be an epidemic week. Conversely, when the consultation rate or viral culture rate was below the threshold in a particular week, it was considered to be a non-epidemic week. Using the control chart method, the threshold level was calculated as two standard deviations (SD) above the \u2018baseline level\u2019. The \u2018baseline level\u2019 was the mean consultation rate or viral culture rate of the study period, after excluding extreme values above the 80th percentile. The respective epidemic and non-epidemic weeks for the consultation rate and viral culture rate were then determined, and sensitivity, specificity and PPV were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the \u2018baseline level\u2019 and threshold level.",

The record forms were also examined for calculation error and illegible hand writing. Five weeks from each year between 2003 and 2009 were selected at random, and all record forms selected were reviewed individually for data quality.
