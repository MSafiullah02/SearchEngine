This agent is frequently incriminated with dermatomycosis in ruminants and horses but not in cats or dogs. A possible explanation for a transitory contamination of cat's hair coat could be contacts with fomites, plants or soil contaminated by hair and scale of infected sheep and goat flocks or recreation horses, as these cases were found in colonies located in suburban counties with rural areas. On the other hand, the isolation rate of Trichophyton mentagrophytes var mentagrophytes (11.9%) may reflect direct or indirect contact with synantropic animal species with potential for tinea transmission, namely rodents such as rats, as the isolation of this dermatophyte from the hair coat of wild animals and synantropic species is well documented.26 The isolation of Microsporum canis (12.5%) was an expected finding because this dermatophyte is the main agent responsible for feline dermatophytosis.27\n",
