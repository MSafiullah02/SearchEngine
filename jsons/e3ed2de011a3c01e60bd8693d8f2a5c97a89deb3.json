A recurring issue for many investigators is the desire to obtain anatomical and physiological information from valuable research animals without sacrificing them. In vivo imaging is a noninvasive way to gain insight into the animal's anatomy and physiology 1 ; however, the unit cost and complexity of many such methods may preclude an investigator's ability to gain access to such devices. Location of the imaging equipment in a shared facility can overcome these obstacles. The vision of the NIH Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) is to offer various state-of-theart, in vivo small-animal imaging techniques in one facility. The MIF is a shared resource for the NIH intramural community, and currently has more than 70 active animal protocols. At this time, the MIF has three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, a micro X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, two ultrasound scanners, a combined luciferase/GFP imager, and a laser Doppler imager. In addition to administrative personnel, the staff consists of a veterinarian, three imaging scientists, an electrical engineer, and three animal technicians. Setting up this facility took planning and intellectual contributions from experts in many fields. We provide resources for a wide variety of investigators from many of the various institutes within the NIH. This is not a 'how-to' manual, but we will discuss some of the issues that the principal players considered when designing and staffing the MIF.",

To obtain the maximum usefulness and ensure success, a certain amount of planning must take place before an instrument is ordered or facility construction begins. Planners should recruit the advice of experts in various imaging fields and involve as many people as necessary to share in the decision-making processes, so that everyone has a voice. Knowledge of the needs of the research community is one of the most important priorities in setting up any facility. A consultation with your research community will help to determine which imaging modalities are most needed. It is pointless to include an instrument that no one will use. Consultation with experienced operators for each of the imaging modes chosen will elicit useful advice on special needs for each instrument. Veterinarians and animal care staff should also have input because they will have a considerable impact on traffic patterns, animal care requirements, and other features. If possible, one should visit other small-animal imaging facilities. What imaging modalities do they have? What problems have they encountered, and how did they solve them?",

The number of animals housed and the duration of housing will have an impact on space usage. Animal welfare guidelines dictate space requirements that must be carefully considered. Moreover, one must also consider space for traffic between housing, preparation rooms, and instruments. At the MIF, we provide temporary housing (Monday-Friday) for mice only. We have one 60-ft 2 animal room with one ventilated rack that can hold 45 shoebox-sized cages. Additionally, we have 400 ft 2 of animal husbandry support area for storage and cage washing. Animals involved in long-term studies that must come to the MIF periodically for imaging are usually returned to a quarantine facility. Because of the surrounding magnetic field, an MRI system requires a large area (\u2265700 ft 2 ). The magnet itself requires \u223c200 ft 2 of surrounding clear area. The fringe field is the distance that the surrounding magnetic field extends before it drops to the level of 5 gauss. The fringe field can occupy an area up to 250 ft 2 . The MRI suite must have a design that prevents casual visitors from entering the fringe field. A magnetic field >15 gauss can adversely affect persons with pacemakers or other metallic implants. The distance to the 15 gauss line varies widely with field strength and magnet type. There are magnets available that have a fringe field limited to a foot or less, but these cost more. MR scanners use extremely heavy magnets; therefore, most facilities locate the MR imager on the ground floor. Additionally, because the magnets are cooled by cryogens, good ventilation must be present. Rapid boil-off of the cryogens could lead to asphyxiation. The instrument manufacturer can provide a detailed description of space requirements and suggested architectural layouts. A facility will need to plan for additional space for the electronics and console for the scanner as well as a preparation area outside the magnetic field. This can amount to another 250 ft 2 .",

Optical imaging devices, which allow the user to monitor gene expression [AUTHOR: EDIT OKAY?], are easy to operate and have no special environmental requirements. There are several different types of optical imaging. Bioluminescence is an enzymatic biochemical process that produces light. The luciferase gene is first inserted into the targeted cell population. Image acquisition requires live cells to process the substrate and produce light. Advantages of bioluminescence include high sensitivity, and virtually no background noise; disadvantages include the need for cofactors (i.e., oxygen, magnesium, and ATP) and expensive substrates (luciferin). Fluorescence imaging also requires genetic manipulation; however, the technology does not require a living system to produce an image. Fluorescence imaging differs from bioluminescence in that light must be applied to the tissue to generate a signal. One advantage of fluorescence imaging is the commercial availability of numerous markers (GFP, DsRed, ICG, and Cy5.5) with no need for substrate or cofactors; a disadvantage is the low signal/noise ratio due to autofluorescence.",

Image acquisition is simple, and it is not necessary to have a dedicated system operator. Investigators can easily learn to perform their own imaging study. Our system's operating software first acquires a black-and-white photographic image of the subject, then acquires the luminescent image, and finally overlays the image onto the photograph for anatomical signal mapping (Fig. 2) . Both bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging are useful to detect tumor cells, monitor tumor growth, or track cell movement (e.g., metastasis).

Each projection is the equivalent of a radiographic image. A method called 'filtered back projection' permits these projections to be reconstructed into a three-dimensional (3D) data set. A micro-CT scanner for rodents typically uses less X-ray power than a conventional clinical CT scanner, so the effective radiation exposure per scan is reduced. The highest radiation dose we have measured was 35 rad for skin, but typical scans are much less (9 rad). The radiation dose is ultimately dependent on the scan parameters (i.e., number of projections, exposure time, X-ray beam strength). CT is excellent for studying the skeletal system, certain internal organs, and fat distribution [7] [8] [9] [10] . CT can also be used for tumor studies, depending on the location of the tumor. A typical 3D image with 100-\u00b5m resolution takes about 10 minutes to acquire; higher resolution images may take up to 25 minutes. Image reconstruction can take as little as 5 extra minutes or up to 24 hours depending on hardware and software options.

Ultrasound is excellent for cardiac studies and evaluation of embryonic development 12, 13 . It may also be used for various organ evaluations, tumors, and guided injections. Advantages of ultrasound include rapid image acquisition and ease of use; however, time is required for the operator to develop proficiency in the acquisition techniques and image interpretation. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for positioning the transducers, as well as evaluating the resulting images. A well-trained operator should be able to distinguish normal and abnormal anatomy. Scattering of the sound waves in the tissue often cause ultrasound images to appear 'noisy' . Also, most ultrasound images are 2D, although some 3D-capable instruments are available. Most ultrasound machines are built on portable carts for easy relocation. The image display is most clearly visible in low ambient light, so this should be a consideration when determining the location for ultrasound imaging.",
