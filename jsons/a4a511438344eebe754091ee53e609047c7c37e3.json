            "text": "However, microinjection has several major shortcomings including low efficiency, random integration and variable expression patterns which mainly reflect the site of integration. Research has focused on the development of alternate methodologies for improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of generating transgenic livestock. These include sperm mediated DNA transfer (Lavitrano et al. 1989; Lavitrano et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2002) , intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI) of sperm heads carrying foreign DNA (Perry et al. 1999; Perry et al. 2001) , injection or infection of oocytes and/or embryos by different types of viral vectors (Haskell and Bowen 1995; Chan et al. 1998; Hofmann et al. 2004) , RNA interference technology (RNAi) (Clark and Whitelaw 2003) and the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) Cibelli et al. 1998; Baguisi et al. 1999; Dai et al. 2002; Lai et al. 2002; table 1) . To date, somatic cell nuclear transfer, which has been successful in 13 species, holds the greatest promise for significant improvements in the generation of transgenic livestock (figure 1). The typical success rate (live births) of mammalian somatic nuclear transfer is low and usually is only 1-2% of the transferred embryos. Cattle seem to be an exception to this rule as levels of 15-20% can be reached . Recently, we have also obtained a significant improvement of porcine cloning efficiency by better selection and optimized treatment of the recipients, specifically by providing a 24h asynchrony between the pre-ovulatory oviducts of the recipients and the reconstructed embryos. Presumably, this gives the embryos additional time to achieve the necessary level of nuclear reprogramming. The improved protocol has resulted in pregnancy rates of~80% and only a slightly reduced mean litter size ). These results show that the efficiency of SCNT is likely to be improved in the near future with significant impact on transgenic animal production. Further qualitative improvements may be derived from technologies that allow precise modifications of the genome including targeted chromosomal integration by site-specific DNA recombinases, such as Cre or FLP, or methods that allow temporally and/or spatially controlled transgene expression (Capecchi 1989; Kilby et al. 1993) . The genomes of farm animals (cattle, chicken, horse, dog, bee) have been sequenced and annotated in http://www.ensembl.org and http://www.ncbi.org (both July 2008). They, thus, provide new opportunities for selective breeding and transgenic animal production. After 12,000 years of domestic animal selection (Copley et al. 2003 ) based on the random mutations resulting from environmental factors such as radiation and oxidative injury, technology is now available to introduce or remove genes with known functions.",

Trans-chromosomal bovine offspring were obtained that expressed human immunoglobulin in their blood. This system is a significant step forward in the production of therapeutic human polyclonal antibodies (Kuroiwa et al. 2002) .

To this end, we have recently produced triple transgenic pigs expressing either human thrombomodulin (hTM) or human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) on top of one or two RCAs to suppress both HAR and the later stage coagulatory disorders observed in experimental porcine-to-primate xenotransplantation . Reproducible survival of porcine xenografts for more than six months in non-human primate recipients is considered to be a necessary precondition to starting clinical trials with human patients. A particularly promising strategy for achieving long-term xenograft survival is to induce tolerance by creating permanent chimerism in the recipient by intraportal injection of embryonic stem cells (F\u00e4ndrich et al. 2002) or by co-transplantation of vascularized thymic tissue (Yamada et al. 2005) . Long term tolerance of HLA-mismatched kidneys has recently been demonstrated in humans (Kawai et al. 2008) .",

Telomeres are the repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of the chromosomes and are crucial for their structural integrity and function and are thought to be related to lifespan. Telomere shortening is correlated with severe limitation of the regenerative capacity of cells, the onset of cancer, ageing and chronic dis-ease with significant impact on human lifespan (Sch\u00e4tzlein and Rudolph 2005) .

Dairy production is an attractive field for targeted genetic modification (Yom andB remel1 993; Karatzas andT urner1 997) andi t is possible to produce milk with a modified lipid composition by modulation of the enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and to increase curd and cheese yield by enhancing expression of the casein gene family in the mammary gland. The bovine casein ratio has already been altered by the over-expression of beta-and kappa-casein, demonstrating the potential of transgenic technology for improving the economic value of bovine milk (Brophye tal. 2003 ). It should also be possible to create 'hypoallergenic' milk by knocking out or knocking down the \u03b2-lactoglobulin gene. One could envision the production of enhanced 'infant milk' containingh uman lactoferrino rt he production of milk whichr esists bacterial contamination by expressing lysozyme, the antibacterial component of egg white and human tears. To generate lactose-free milk, a knockout or knockdown at the \u03b1-lactalbumin locus would suppress this key step in milk sugar synthesis. Lactose reduced or lactose-free milk would render dairy products suitable forconsumption by thelarge proportion of theworld's adult population who do not produce an active intestinal lactase. Lactose is themajor osmoticallyactivesubstance in milk andits absencemight be expected to interfere with milk secretion. However, a lactase construct has been tested in the mammary gland of transgenic mice and in hemizygous mice; this reduced lactose content by 50-85% without altering milk secretion (Jost et al. 1999 ). On the other hand, experimental transgenic mice with a homozygous knockout for \u03b1-lactalbumin could not nurse their offspring because of the high viscosity of their milk (Stinnakre et al. 1994 ).",

These pigs carry a bacterial phytase gene under transcriptional control of a salivary gland specific promoter, which allows the pigs to digest plant phytate. Without the bacterial enzyme, phytate passes through the animal undigested and pollutes the environment with phosphorus if uncontained. With the bacterial enzyme, fecal phosphorus output was reduced up to 75% (Golovan et al. 2001) . These environmentally friendly pigs may be used for commercial production in Canada within the next few years.",

However, some genetic loci are known to confer resistance against specific diseases. Transgenic strategies to enhance disease resistance include the transfer of major histocompatibility-complex (MHC) genes, T cell receptor genes, immunoglobulin genes, genes that affect lymphokines, or specific disease resistance genes (M\u00fcller and Brem 1991) . A prominent example for a specific disease resistance gene is the murine Mx-gene. Production of the Mx1-protein is induced by interferon. This was discovered in inbred mouse strains that were resistant to influenza viruses (Staeheli 1991) . Microinjection of an interferonand virus-inducible Mx-construct into porcine zygotes resulted in two transgenic pig lines which expressed the Mx-mRNA; but no Mx protein was detected (M\u00fcller et al. 1992 ). The bovine MxI gene was identified and shown to confer antiviral activity when transfected into in Vero cells (Baise et al. 2004 ). Transgenic constructs bearing the immunoglobulin-A (IgA) gene have been successfully introduced into pigs, sheep and mice in an attempt to increase resistance against infections (Lo et al. 1991) . Expression of the murine IgA gene was successful in two transgenic pig lines but only the light chains could be detected and the IgA-molecules showed only marginal binding to phosphorylcholine (Lo et al. 1991 ). On the other hand, high levels of monoclonal murine antibodies with a high binding affinity for their specific antigen have been produced in transgenic pigs (Weidle et al. 1991) .",

The fluorescent medaka is currently marketed by the Taiwanese company Taikong. The \"GloFish \u00ae \" is a trademarked transgenic zebra fish (Danio rerio) expressing red fluorescent protein from a sea anemone under the transcriptional control of a muscle-specific promoter (Gong et al. 2003) . Green and yellow fluores-cent proteins have also been introduced into the zebra fish to give different fluorescence colors. Yorktown Technologies (www.glofish.com, July 2007) initiated commercial sales of the transgenic zebrafish in the United States with retail prices of approximately $ 5,00 each. The GloFish \u00ae thus became the first transgenic animal freely distributed throughout the USA. A recent report of the FDA contained no evidence that GloFish \u00ae represents a risk (US FDA, 2003) . Commercialization of fluorescent fish has gone forward in several countries other than the USA, including Taiwan, Malaysia, and Hongkong, whereas marketing in Australia, Canada and European Union is currently prohibited.",

Newer, binary expression systems based on prokaryotic control elements are responsive to exogenous IPTG (Isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalactopyranosid), RU-486, ecdysone or tetracycline derivatives and give more tightly controlled expression (Lewandowski 2001; Corbel and Rossi 2002) . The first tetracycline system that was successfully used in mice required two DNA constructs. One was for doxycycline controlled expression of a transactivator and the other contained regulatory elements which conferred transactivator dependent expression of the target gene. These DNA constructs were typically integrated into two different lines of transgenic mice. After crossbreeding the two lines of transgenic mice, their offspring expressed the target gene only after stimulation with doxycycline (Furth et al. 1994) . Unfortunately, the long generation intervals make this approach unfeasible in livestock species (Niemann and Kues 2003) . Recently, we reported on a tetracycline-responsive bicistronic expression cassette (NTA) in which expression was amplified by transactivator mediated positive feedback . This was used to produce the first tetracycline controlled transgenic expression in a farm animal. The auto-regulatory cassette was integrated at a single chromosomal site in the pig genome after pronuclear DNA injection and was designed to give ubiquitous expression of a human regulator of complement activation (RCA) independent of cellular transcription cofactors. Expression from this construct could be inhibited reversibly by feeding the animals doxycycline (tet-off system). In ten transgenic pig lines in which only one copy of the NTA cassette was integrated, the transgene was silenced in all tissues with the exception of skeletal muscle where expression was limited to a small number of discrete muscle fibers (Niemann and Kues 2003) . However, crossbreeding of lines to produce animals with two NTA cassettes resulted in reactivation of the cassettes and strong, tissueindependent, tetracycline-sensitive RCA expression. It seems that crossing the transgenic pig lines, which doubled the level of transactivator, was able to overcome epigenetic silencing. Transgene expression in the double transgenic pigs was inversely correlated with the level of NTA cassette DNA methylation . This approach highlights the importance of understanding epigenetic (trans)-gene regulation in the pig.",

Transmission of the donor haplotype to the next generation after germ-cell transplantation has been achieved in goats (Honaramooz et al. 2003) . Current major obstacles of this strategy are the lack of efficient in vitro culture methods for primordial germ/prospermatogonial cells and the lack of efficient gene transfer techniques for these cells. Recently adeno-associated virus (AAV ) was found to be suitable for delivering transgenes to infect a mal germ cell and germline tansmission was reported in goats and mice (Honaramooz et al. 2007 ).

The health of all transgenic animals is closely monitored because of the time and money invested in their creation and because all work is basic research. A small number of studies have systematically investigated the health effects of transgenesis. A study of the effects of human growth hormone expression in pigs and sheep identified specific pathological phenotypes related to their accelerated growth rate. These problems were eliminated in subsequent transgenic animals by modifications to the gene constructs (Nottle et al. 1999) . In pigs, transgenic for human DAF and maintained under qualified pathogen free conditions, haematological parameters and blood chemistry were similar to non-transgenic controls (Tucker et al. 2002) . With the exception of slightly accelerated growth rates, no deviations were found. A detailed pathomorphological examination of nine lines of hemizygous pigs expressing human RCAs revealed no adverse effects related to transgene expression (Deppenmeier et al. 2006) , providing clear evidence that transgenesis per se does not compromise animal health and welfare. Investigation of animals carrying the NTA bicistronic expression cassette, driving hCD59 and a tetracycline regulated transactivator revealed that multi-transgenic animals display a normal health status (Deppenmeier et al. 2006) . The hemizygous lines were fertile and produced normal litter sizes.",

Proteins are heat labile, subject to microbial contamination, can be damaged by shear forces and can be immunogenic and allergenic. In the United States, the FDA has developed guidelines to assure safe commercial exploitation of recombinant biological products. A crucial consideration with animal derived products is the prevention of transmission of pathogens from animals to humans . This requires sensitive and reliable diagnostic and screening methods for various pathogenic organisms. Furthermore, transgenic farm animal based applications require strict standards of quality control. MALDI-TOF-spectometry is an important tool in this context (Hughes et al. 2000; Templin et al. 2002) . Meanwhile, improvements in RNA isolation and in unbiased global amplification of picogram amounts of mRNA enable researchers to analyse RNA from single embryos (Brambrink et al. 2002; ).

Progress in animal genomics has broadly followed the route pioneered by the human genome project in terms of the assembly, publication and utilization of the data. This is evident in the advanced drafts of the bovine, porcine, horse, canine, chicken, and honeybee genomic maps. The ability to engineer the genome is new and the advent of new molecular tools and breeding technologies is benefiting this field.

Despite continued efforts, no ES-cell lines with germ line potential have been established from mammals other than the mouse although ES-like cells have been reported in several species and have been maintained in culture from 13 weeks to three years (Gjorret and Maddox-Hyttel 2005) . True germ line competent ES cell lines from farm animal species will permit exploitation of the full power of recombinant DNA technology in animal breeding. This is critical for the development of sustainable and diversified animal production systems for the future.
