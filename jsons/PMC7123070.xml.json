            "text": "Historically, crustacean collections were held in private collections or university museums. Collections from oceans were restricted to the intertidal regions or ship based, and for obvious reasons discovery lagged behind terrestrial discovery. The age of great ocean expeditions that fed into fish parasite knowledge included amongst others the US Exploring Expedition (several ships, 1838\u20131842), the Galathea Expedition (Danish, 1845\u20131847) and the Siboga Expedition (Dutch, 1899\u20131900). As scientific research developed, state (national) museums were founded as the major repositories for all natural history collections, such as the British Museum (founded in 1753 and the first national public museum in the world), the Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019histoire naturelle (1793) and in the New World, the US National Museum (1846), to name just three. As technology improved, scientists were able to use new techniques to not only collect parasites (such as SCUBA diving) but also to view them (such as scanning electron microscopy [SEM] and differential interference contrast [DIC] microscopy). Currently, the use of molecular biology techniques for parasites is on the rise. These techniques can assist with parasite identification and characterisation, as well as provide other useful information on the parasite origin and evolution (amongst other things).",

It is envisaged that understanding the past research will indicate the gaps in our knowledge within these groups and contribute to identifying where research should focus in the future. The chapter focused primarily on the taxonomic and systematic discovery of parasitic crustaceans, along with notes on selected contributors to our knowledge of parasitic Crustacea. It should be noted that the chapter is not intended to be a checklist and does not refer to every researcher who has worked on the parasitic Crustacea.",

L\u00fctken, a Danish zoologist, worked on a number of aquatic groups including corals, jellyfish, crustaceans and annelids, but his passion lay with echinoderms and fishes, and thus only a few of his papers were dedicated to cyamids.

Gruner contributed to the taxonomy of amphipods and isopods and was best known for his Lehrbuch der Speziellen Zoologie (Textbook on Special Zoology) published in 1980. A few years later, in 1999, Joel Martin and John Heyning provided an updated key and checklist for these parasites, which proved helpful in subsequent studies (Martin and Heyning 1999).",

            "text": "As cyamids are permanently attached to constantly moving cetaceans, in-depth studies on the parasites have been difficult; however, despite these challenges, many scientists have been able to report on their ecology. Juan Antonio Balbuena and Juan Antonio Raga published many papers on parasites of marine mammals and discussed the ecology and host relationships of whale lice on pilot whales (Balbuena and Raga 1991). Furthermore, Victoria Rowntree, an American whale researcher, has noted many behavioural aspects of these amphipods (on right whales in particular). Cyamids are known to aggregate in areas where there is the least amount of stress (out of the main water flow areas), such as the skin folds on the head, eyes, flippers, blowholes, lip margins, around barnacles and callosities (Leung 1970a, b; Rowntree 1996). The abundance of the cyamids on their host is inversely proportional to the host\u2019s swimming speed, with slower whales having several thousand on a single host and faster-swimming dolphins having fewer (Goater et al. 2014). The mouthparts of the cyamids are highly modified, with setae and short spines on the maxillae, maxillules and mandibles, for excavating and eating host skin. Rowntree (1996) confirmed that these ectoparasites eat whale skin containing pigments (seen in the intestines of the amphipods), and shortly thereafter Schell et al. (2000) confirmed this diet with the aid of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. More recently, Rowntree and colleagues have used genetic sequence variation in the whale lice of right whales in order to determine population histories (Kaliszewska et al. 2005).",

Johan Christian Fabricius (Fig. 2.1d) (a Danish zoologist) described two of these species, namely, Cystisoma spinosum (Fabricius, 1775) (nomen dubium) and Scina crassicornis (Fabricius, 1775). The third species, Phronima sedentaria (Forsk\u00e5l, 1775), was described by the Swedish researcher, Peter Forsk\u00e5l. Interestingly, both these men were students of Linnaeus at some point. Although these three species were the first named hyperiids, there was an earlier record in 1762 by H. Str\u00f8m of a hyperiid in association with a host, where Hyperia medusarum (M\u00fcller, 1776) was located inside a large jellyfish (Harbison et al. 1977).",

Using SCUBA to collect live material, Harbison and colleagues were able to observe a number of associations between the amphipods and their hosts that had never been noted before (Harbison et al. 1977; Madin and Harbison 1977). Many observations of living hyperiids were also made by Philippe Laval (from 1963 until he retired in 2004) (Fig. 2.1i). Laval was one of the first researchers to recognise that all hyperiids have a parasitic way of life (noted in his doctoral thesis in 1974), which was later confirmed by Harbison et al. (1977) and published (amongst others) an extensive paper on these parasites associated with gelatinous zooplankton (Laval 1980).",

Barnard was an outstanding amphipod taxonomist, primarily working on the Gammaridea. Years later, Vinogradov (1991) published a key for the genus in Russian. In 2004, Freire and Serejo (2004) provided a key to the Brazilian species and recorded the first Trischizostoma from the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. A recent publication by Winfield et al. (2017) added the first record from the north-east Pacific. The distribution of these two groups now is as follows: the \u201centire telson\u201d group are known from the north-east and south-west Atlantic Ocean, the north-west and north-east Pacific Ocean and the Indo-Pacific, while the \u201cnotched telson\u201d group are from the south-east Atlantic and south-west Indian Ocean (Winfield et al. 2017).",

Bonnier started his zoological career after meeting Giard and was his student for nearly 30 years. In his 1900 review of the bopyrids, Bonnier named a species after Giard, Bopyrina giardi Bonnier, 1900, but it has since been synonymised with Bopyrina ocellata (Czerniavsky, 1868). Furthermore, the infectious protozoan parasite genus Giardia K\u00fcnstler, 1882, was named in honour of Giard for providing the first description of Giardia lamblia (Lambl, 1859) Kofoid & Christiansen, 1915. Sadly, both men passed away in 1908, Giard on his 62nd birthday and Bonnier at 49 years of age from a brain disease he contracted while on a trip in 1904.",

Within this review, they included historic, biogeographic, systematic, taxonomic, reproductive and ecological information for these isopods. These three authors have also completed a number of taxonomic revisions of several genera from southern Africa (Hadfield et al. 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015; Hadfield and Smit 2017), including the description of several new species. Trilles (1994) mentioned there was a lack of information from the Southern Hemisphere, and specifically South Africa and South America, and these papers aimed at addressing this knowledge gap. Furthermore, these authors produced a publication on revising poorly known type material to minimise potential future misidentifications within one of the more complicated genera, Ceratothoa Dana, 1852 (Hadfield et al. 2016).",

The first recognisable drawing of a gnathiid was made by a Dutch zoologist, Slabber (1769), who drew a larval form and was uncertain as to which family the strange isopod belonged. The first adult male, Gnathia maxillaris (Montagu, 1804) (described as Cancer maxillaris), was described a few decades later by Montagu, who then went on to describe the first gnathiid larva found feeding on a fish host (Montagu 1804, 1813). Due to the unique appearance of this isopod, Leach (1814) established a new genus, Gnathia Leach, 1814. However, there was plenty of confusion regarding the appearance of three very different life forms (the adults, the swollen praniza larvae and the smaller zuphea larvae), which led researchers to believe that they were separate species (Risso 1816; Bate 1858). It was by accident that Hesse (1864) established the link between the different forms while keeping a praniza in water to sketch when it moulted into an adult. Forty years later, the first life cycle of a gnathiid, Gnathia maxillaris, was described by Smith (1904). This was the first account of the different life stages and development of these isopods, and Smith was able to observe that the adult stages do not feed.",

Brattstr\u00f6m, who founded the journal Sarsia (named after the Norwegian natural scientists M. Sars and G.O. Sars), became an expert in ascothoracids following his PhD thesis research on echinoderms. He described the genus Ulophysema Brattstr\u00f6m, 1936, and named five ascothoracid species. Furthermore, Brattstr\u00f6m provided detailed reviews of the ecology, life cycle, morphology and larval development of U. oeresundense (Brattstr\u00f6m 1936, 1947, 1948a, b). Shortly thereafter, Melander (1950) completed studies on the chromosomes of U. oeresundense, and the species was used in numerous reviews and comparisons with other species. As this parasite is found enclosed in different organs of irregular sea urchins (most often in the genital glands or perivisceral cavity), the ultrastructure of its integument was also studied by Bresciani and Jespersen (1985).",

Grygier has described 10 new ascothoracid genera as well as 51 new species (almost half of the known species in the infraclass). Grygier (1981) reviewed the sperm of Dendrogaster Knipovich, 1890, and determined that it was the most primitive sperm discovered in Crustacea (Grygier 1981). Two years later, he separated the crinoid-infecting Waginella Grygier, 1983, from Synagoga Norman, 1888, which disrupted the subordinal classification suggested by Wagin, which was based on the phylum of the host (Grygier 1983). The classification of the Ascothoracida was then updated by Grygier (1987), who divided the group into two orders and six families. A few years later Grygier (1996) completed a rare demographic study on a deep-sea parasite Parascothorax synagogoides Wagin, 1964, parasitising the brittlestar Ophiophthalmus normani (Lyman, 1879) (see Grygier 1991), and in 1996, he published a comprehensive account of the Ascothoracida (Grygier 1996).",

In 1872, Noll placed both Alcippe and Cryptophialus into Darwin\u2019s order Abdominalia. In 1905, Gruvel realised that the cirri on the terminal body segments thought to be abdominal appendages (hence the order\u2019s name) was in fact from the thorax, so the order was changed to Acrothoracica. Around the same time, Norman (1903) changed the genus name from Alcippe to Trypetesa, as the former name was preoccupied (homonym) by birds in the family Pellorneidae.\n",

Trypetesa lampas, removed from ovigerous female hosts, were found to contain hermit crab eggs, chorions, as well as yolk in their gut. There is still uncertainty surrounding how these barnacles feed, but this research documented how they can have significant negative effects on hermit crab reproduction. Other studies have showed blue-green algae-like particles in the gut of Trypetesa lampas (see Kamens 1981), and it may be that barnacles in male hermit crabs filter feed on particles from the water, whereas barnacles in females feed on the hermit crab eggs (Williams et al. 2011). Murphy and Williams (2013) verified this study and suggested that the more accurate term for these barnacles may be \u201ctransient parasites\u201d as they can be harmful in some cases but cause no harmful impact in other cases. Larsen et al. (2016) added that the barnacles do not rely on the egg predation to any substantial degree and found much of the data they collected on prevalence, load, reproductive cycles, and host relationships differed from previous studies. This highlighted the fact that there is still a lot of work to be done on these barnacles before we fully understand their ecology.",

They are endoparasites of other crustaceans, especially decapods. Currently there are 2 orders, 11 families, 41 genera and 288 species known. The adult females have lost most of the traits usually associated with Crustacea and are also known to influence the morphology and biology of their hosts which sets them apart from other groups. These adult female parasitic barnacles consist of an \u201cexterna\u201d (an external sac-like body for reproduction) and an \u201cinterna\u201d (a root-like body inside the host for nutrient uptake), with the male inside the female externa, joined by a small stalk (H\u00f8eg 1995; H\u00f8eg and L\u00fctzen 1995). Many rhizocephalans are known to cause parasitic sterilisation or castration of their crustacean hosts. Depending on the species, these parasites can lower reproductive outputs, cause eggs to die within a few days or completely inhibit gonad processes required for reproduction (H\u00f8eg 1995). Along with the degeneration of the gonads, rhizocephalans can also cause feminisation of male hosts. This may include testes converting to ovaries, changes in the overall shape and size of the hosts and possibly even changing the behaviour of the host (H\u00f8eg 1995).",

Whereas all kentrogonids exhibit similar characteristics (including the presence of the specialised female post-settlement stage, the kentrogon, as well as the equivalent male stage, the trichogon), all of the akentrogonids do not have similar characteristics other than the absence of the kentrogon (Walker 2001). Within the Kentrogonida is the family Sacculinidae, which is one of the more renowned groups of parasites due to their ability to cause parasitic sterilisation in crabs. The genus Sacculina Thompson, 1836, holds the majority of the rhizocephalan species with approximately 129 known species. The first described species was Sacculina carcini Thompson, 1836, making it one of the most studied barnacle parasites.",

Unfortunately, the parasite is not host specific, and it could spread if it were introduced as a control agent (Murphy and Goggin 2000). This was put to the test by Goddard et al. (2005). Four native North American crab species were infected with the European green crab\u2019s natural parasite, Sacculina carcini Thompson, 1836. Although the parasite preferred the green crab, there were still a significant number of native crabs infected (all without producing a reproductive sac) which would result in the loss of many indigenous species.",

Only two genera were originally thought to be parasitic, namely, the monotypic genus Anelasma Darwin, 1851, comprising Anelasma squalicola (Lov\u00e9n, 1844), and Rhizolepas Day, 1939 (with two species, R. annelidicola Day, 1939, and R. gurjanovae Zevina, 1968).

Although this species was described many decades ago, it has rarely been studied. It was first noted by Gunnerus (1763) on the velvet belly lantern shark, Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758), but he did not name or adequately describe it. This paper was largely overlooked by researchers, and only a decade later did the Swedish marine zoologist Sven Ludvig Lov\u00e9n (Fig. 2.6f) (1844) formally describe it as \u201cAlepas squalicola\u201d. Shortly thereafter, Charles Darwin (Fig. 2.6a) realised in his monographic review of barnacles (Darwin 1851) that the species was in the wrong genus and assigned it to his new genus, Anelasma. Recently, the feeding strategy of this species was analysed to determine if the barnacle is purely parasitic or is still capable of using suspension feeding to obtain nutrition (Ommundsen et al. 2016). The authors concluded that the barnacle uses the host exclusively as a food source using a de novo evolved feeding mechanism. Other noteworthy publications on A. squalicola include the phylogenetic analysis of these barnacles (Rees et al. 2014), as well as studies that it causes retarded growth in the shark reproductive organs (Yano and Musick 2000).",

This species was found to feed on coral tissue and differs from Anelasma and Rhizolepas in having modified the basic feeding mechanism rather than using a separate absorptive process (root system), making it the only sessile barnacle to be wholly parasitic (Ross and Newman 1969, 1995; Frick et al. 2011).

No other species were described until 1991 when Mark Grygier (Fig. 2.5e) and William Anderson Newman (Fig. 2.6g) added another genus and two new species to this group of parasites (Grygier and Newman 1991). Although their method of feeding has not been thoroughly studied, these barnacles cause detrimental effects to their host. Grignard and Jangoux (1994) concluded that the barnacles inhibited the growth of the urchin spine upon which it attaches. The thoracopods are not used for filter-feeding, and it is unlikely that they scavenge, so it is possible that much of their food is obtained from host tissue (Grygier and Newman 1991).",

In 1975, Becker described a new parasitic crustacean genus infesting copepods off the coast of Peru. This parasite, Basipodella harpacticola Becker, 1975, was incorrectly placed into the subclass Copepoda. In 1980, Deoterthron Bradford & Hewitt, 1980, was discovered parasitising ostracods in New Zealand (Bradford and Hewitt 1980). Bradford and Hewitt (1980) noticed that the two genera were closely related but considered them to belong with the Cirripedia rather than the Copepoda. Grygier (1983) noted that although he agreed these species belonged in the then \u201cMaxillopoda\u201d (now Oligostraca and Multicrustacea), they did not fit in either the Copepoda or Cirripedia. In resolving this uncertainty, Geoffrey Allan Boxshall (Fig. 2.6h) and Roger J. Lincoln (1983) proposed a new class, Tantulocarida, with the two genera Basipodella Becker, 1975 and Deoterthron, distinct but of similar rank to the Cirripedia and Copepoda.",

Cyclops M\u00fcller, 1785, is one of the most common freshwater copepod genera with approximately 200 valid species. It belongs to the family Cyclopidae, which is the largest cyclopoid family with over 1100 valid species. Members of this family are predominantly free-living; however, several species are intermediate hosts for numerous pathogenic human and fish parasites such as Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis (Linnaeus, 1758)), as well as cestodes (tapeworms) and nematodes (round worms) (Piasecki et al. 2004). Recently, Eucyclops bathanalicola Boxshall & Strong, 2006 was described from Lake Tanganyika in a rare occurrence of a freshwater copepod parasitic on an invertebrate host (mantle cavity of Bathanalia straeleni Leloup, 1953). This association is also noteworthy as it also represents a unique account of a parasite in what is primarily a free-living family (Boxshall and Strong 2006).",

            "text": "The second cyclopoid species discovered by Linnaeus belongs to the genus Lernaea Linnaeus, 1758, a widely known genus of freshwater fish parasites, commonly referred to as anchor worms. Lernaea cyprinacea was originally described from Europe in 1745 under a trinomial name but was then redescribed by Linnaeus in 1758 (see Kabata 1979). Anchor worms burrow into the skin of its host fish and can cause a disease called lernaeosis where haemorrhagic ulcers occur at the attachment site. Death of the host can occur due to secondary infections and severe bleeding (Khalifa and Post 1976; Kabata 1985). This species has been recorded worldwide and is thought to have been spread through the movement of aquarium species (Innal and Oldewage 2012). The family Lernaeidae is probably one of the most studied cyclopoid groups due to its importance in aquaculture. Lernaea spp. have been reported to cause mass mortalities as early as 1880. According to Kocy\u0142owski and Mi\u0105czy\u0144ski (1960), lernaeosis almost demolished an entire population of crucian carp in the Masurian Lake District (Poland) in 1880. An interesting case of catfish mortality due to gill damage (including epithelial hyperplasia, telangiectasis and haemorrhage) caused by Lernaea cyprinacea was also noted in Arkansas by Goodwin (1999). Bighead carp in the same tanks, with approximately the same number of copepods externally, did not die. Fish mortalities due to gill damage from Lernaea copepodids had never been reported before. This was most likely due to the polyculturing of the catfish with the bighead carp (an excellent host for Lernaea) and the filter-feeding apparatus of the carp preventing large infestations on their gill filaments.",

One genus, Balaenophilus Aurivillius, 1879 (with three species), known to occur on the external surfaces of turtles, whales and manatees, appears to be both epibionts and parasites. Kazunari Ogawa and colleagues recorded the first copepod on a sea turtle and noticed the turtle\u2019s skin inside the gut, which led the authors to the conclusion that the copepods feed on the turtle and not algae or diatoms (Ogawa et al. 1997). According to Badillo et al. (2007), there was definite evidence of Balaenophilus ingesting whale and sea turtle host tissue; however, the extent of this on the host is unknown. Mild signs of a tissue reaction was also observed in turtles with large numbers of copepods present at one time (>500). However, when Su\u00e1rez-Morales et al. (2010) confirmed the presence of these copepods on manatees, they could not see any effect on the hosts. Healthy skin was observed at the site of attachment when Balaenophilus manatorum (Ort\u00edz, Lalana & Torres, 1992) was removed, and no difference was seen in their reproduction or behaviour. Thus, their status as parasites remains unclear at this point.",

Juvenile Genesis vulcanoctopusi L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Bresciani & Huys, 2000, however, were located within the connective tissue of the octopod integument, indicating the possibility that these parasites may have both endo- and ectoparasitic phases (L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2000). The first species described from this family was Tisbe furcata (Baird, 1837). Arthur Grover Humes listed specimens labelled as T. furcata from the mantle of Ocnus planci (Brandt, 1835), a sea cucumber (see Humes 1980); however, the identification was by Monticelli in 1892 and is doubtful.

The endoparasitic forms are known to occur in polychaetes, molluscs and other invertebrates (Davis 1984; Huys et al. 2007). According to Mexican marine biologist and researcher, Eduardo Su\u00e1rez-Morales (Fig. 2.7f) (2011), the first reported monstrilloid was from a Norwegian fjord in 1842 (Kr\u00f8yer 1842). A single preadult specimen of Monstrilla typica (Kr\u00f8yer, 1849) (originally named Thaumatoessa typica in the 1842 publication) was illustrated by Kr\u00f8yer but without any description. This description was only provided in 1849 (with a slight alteration to the original name), along with the diagnosis of a new genus (Kr\u00f8yer 1849). The monstrilloid naupliar stage was first described by Giesbrecht (1893), shortly followed by the drawings and descriptions of the nauplius and development of the endoparasites of Haemocera by Malaquin (1901). In 1994, Grygier re-examined the \u201cThaumatoessa (Thaumaleus) typica\u201d type specimen in order to determine its identity and moved it into the genus Monstrilla Dana, 1849. Shortly thereafter, Grygier (1995) published an annotated chronological bibliography of the Monstrilloida.",

Ho\u2019s work on symbiotic copepods has exceeded 257 publications on these crustaceans from around the world.

Gill maggots from the genus Salmincola Wilson, 1915, can occur in large numbers and cause significant mortalities in aquaculture facilities (Sutherland and Wittrock 1985), but they are less abundant in wild populations and have a smaller impact (Amundsen et al. 1997).",

The genus was named in recognition of the numerous ommatidia in the compound eyes (diminutive of the mythical Greek beast, Argus, which had a hundred eyes) (Wilson 1902). The majority of the earlier studies focused on the first Argulus species, A. foliaceus. The nervous and genital systems as well as other microscopic anatomy of A. foliaceus were described by Leydig (1850, 1889), with studies on the larval development initiated by Claus (1875). Wilson (1902, 1904a, b) continued the larval and hatching research, with additional data added on the genital system and the circulatory system. Wilson also covered the taxonomic studies of North American Argulus (Wilson 1916, 1920a, b, 1921, 1923, 1924), some of which were revised by Meehan (1940). Wilson (1944) admired some of the new data provided by Meehan, especially the key to the genus, but disagreed with the taxonomic species revisions calling it a \u201cserious encroachment upon the genus\u201d. The taxonomy and identification keys of African Argulus species were completed by Cunnington (1913), Monod (1928), Fryer (1956, 1959, 1961a, b, 1965a, b, 1968) and Rushton-Mellor (1994a, b, c), while the South American species were covered by Brian (1947) and Ringuelet (1943, 1948).",

Fryer recognised three different species from the single variant species, C. inermis var. schoutedeni described by Brian (1940). One species was established as C. schoutedeni Brian, 1940, while the other two species were described by Fryer as new to science (C. congicus Fryer, 1959, and C. flaccifrons Fryer, 1960a). This discovery made him the authority of more than half of the Chonopeltis species known at the time (Fryer 1959, 1960a). Furthermore, Fryer completed noteworthy ecological studies on this genus, noting for the first time that the adults are sedentary (Fryer 1956), and there is a lack of cephalic lobe rods in C. flaccifrons (see Fryer 1960a). Fryer went on to describe several more species, produce a key for the genus and show the difference between Chonopeltis and the already known Argulus and Dolops larvae with the lack of metanauplius or juvenile-like morphology in the first descriptions of the Chonopeltis larval stages (Fryer 1964, 1974, 1977).\n",

Additionally, van As and van As (1996) provided the first SEM image of the Chonopeltis larva; and Avenant-Oldewage and colleagues used histology to elucidate the morphology of the digestive system (Swanepoel and Avenant-Oldewage 1993; Avenant-Oldewage et al. 1994). In 2017, Van As et al. revised the southern African species of Chonopeltis and found that contrary to earlier theories, each river system does not have its own species of Chonopeltis. After careful examination of all C. meridionalis Fryer, 1964; C. victori Avenant-Oldewage, 1991; and C. koki Van As, 1992, material, it was concluded that all are indeed the same species, C. meridionalis, and occur in multiple river systems but only on cyprinid hosts (Van As et al. 2017).",

This genus is only known from South America and is the only branchiuran genus endemic to that region. These parasites infect piranhas (Carvalho et al. 2003) and can sometimes occur in certain areas with a prevalence as high as 73% (Mamani et al. 2004). As Dipteropeltis species have not been collected very often, and studies on members of this genus are very limited, information on other life stages, development and ecology is scanty.",

Dolops ranarum (Stuhlmann, 1891) and D. tasmanianus Fryer, 1969 are known from sub-Saharan Africa and Tasmania (Australia), respectively, making this genus widespread but confined to the southern hemisphere. The first Dolops was noticed by the French entomologist Jean Victoire Audouin (1837) who thought the specimens looked like Argulus but without the suction discs. The meaning of the generic name is uncertain but has a Greek mythology origin. Unaware of the naming of Dolops, Heller described Gyropeltis Heller, 1857, which was based on the South American species. Although it was described after Audouin, Heller\u2019s description contained detailed drawings and notes not seen in the publication by Audouin. Due to this, some authors used Gyropeltis rather than Dolops (see Kr\u00f8yer 1863; Thorell 1864). Only 33 years later (and 60 years after describing Dolops) did Bouvier (1897) use the correct genus name and explain how, even if it seems less informative, Dolops was sufficiently described by Audouin and is the accepted authority for the genus.",

However, the first species, Linguatula serrata Fr\u00f6lich, 1789, was only named 2 years later, from the lung of a hare. This species is one of the most synonymised pentastomes with 13 junior synonyms. The Swedish-born \u201cfather of helminthology\u201d, Karl Asmund Rudolphi (Fig. 2.8f), recognised that these worms were different to others and placed them into a single group, the genus Pentastomum Rudolphi, 1812. However, he was still unable to place them (like many others after him), and they have been grouped with various taxa including annelids, mites, myriapods, onychophorans and tardigrades (see Abele et al. 1989). Dujardin (1845) believed these parasites were different from all the other worms and most closely resembled arthropods based on their striated muscles. Using molecular techniques, Abele et al. (1989) concluded that pentastomids belong in the Crustacea as they are more closely related to fish lice (Argulus) rather than any of the other possible taxa mentioned above. Almeida and Christoffersen (1999) also used cladistics on the pentastomids and challenged some of the older ideas. With the recent discovery of fossil data, there is even more discussion on the phylogenetics and status of this group (see Castellani et al. 2011).",

Sambon (1922a, b) revised Linguatulidae and identified differences between the different linguatulid groups as well as added new subfamilies and genera.

Charles Branch Wilson (Fig. 2.7h) was the first to categorically state that these Cypridina Milne-Edwards, 1840, ostracods were parasitic (upon the gills of several fish), that the occurrence was not accidental and that it was not temporary (formation of a pocket to keep the crustacean in place). However, it was debated that these crustaceans are not truly parasitic and only attach to injured or unhealthy fish that are trapped (Cohen 1983). According to Stepien and Brusca (1985), adult fishes in large, nearshore cages were attacked at night by zooplankton swarms, primarily consisting of the luminescent ostracod, Vargula tsujii Kornicker & Baker, 1977, and the cirolanid isopod, Cirolana diminuta Menzies, 1962. Although the ostracods attached and fed on mucus and skin of the fish, they did not appear to inflict serious harm on the host. They were only found inside fish damaged by the cirolanid isopods and thus could not be considered parasites in this instance.",

(1997) compared the histopathology and feeding appendages of ostracods with different feeding strategies. The \u201cparasitic\u201d ostracod investigated, Sheina orri Harding, 1966, was found in the gills of the epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum (Bonnaterre, 1788) in Australia. The authors noted that this crustacean used their mandibular and maxillular claws to attach to the gills, which caused damage to the gills. The claws seemed to be adapted for this purpose, and the damage to the gills suggested they had been attached for a considerable amount of time. Thus, it is a parasite for at least part of its life cycle. This study also found that Wilson\u2019s (1913) description of Photeros parasitica (Wilson, 1913) (originally as Cypridina parasitica) was so similar to Sheina orri that it is most likely parasitic too. More individual studies on the different symbiotic ostracods need to be completed in order to determine if true parasitism is found in other ostracod species.",

            "text": "This chapter reviews many of the historical highlights from the different parasitic Crustacea groups and provides a succinct background to these diverse organisms. Reviewing the literature has revealed how many of the earlier discoveries were dependant on research vessels and expeditions which covered only specific areas. With time, these discoveries became more linked to the area where the respective taxonomist was based and what material they had at their disposal. This led to a biased account on species diversity, influenced by the researcher rather than the presence of the parasite. Furthermore, most of the early biologists were involved in many different fields and described new species from diverse taxa. Over the years, this pattern has altered, and there are now more taxa-specific parasitologists working on species from around the world. It is important to note that many of the currently known crustacean parasitologists are however near retirement; thus, young researchers need to be trained to continue their outstanding work. With a better understanding of what has been done, we can now focus on what needs to be done in order to gain further insight into this unique group of parasites and their niche in the aquatic environment.",
