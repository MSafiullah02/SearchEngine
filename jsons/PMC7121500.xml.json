The trap refers to the inability of the poor to improve their well-being. There are many reasons for this: Lack of access, such as transport services, to employment; lack of educational facilities and skills transfer to provide opportunities for gainful employment; lack of government social security support for the poor; ineffective policies and corruption; and the list goes on.",

Pro-poor policies and strategies include transfer payments, government employment programmes, participatory development, community self-help, social upliftment, rural agricultural reforms and providing infrastructure to ensure the poor also benefit from services and have access to the most basic of life\u2019s essentials. Many infrastructure investments in Africa are motivated by the firm belief that they will lead to poverty alleviation and organic growth in the longer term. Amongst infrastructure, roads are considered one of the most critical in this process because they can have a significant and substantial impact on growth and poverty by providing access to jobs, services and markets.",
