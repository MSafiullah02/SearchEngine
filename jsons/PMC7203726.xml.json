Polimicrobial infections are seen regularly in immunocompromised critically ill patients. Fungal coinfections were described in children [2] and adults suffering ARDS [3, 4] due to viral infections.

            "text": "A 67-year-old man with progressive dyspnea over 2 days was presented to the emergency department. Due to respiratory insufficiency he required intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation and was therefore directly admitted to the ICU. The patient had a history of high-dose steroid therapy (dexamethasone 24 mg/day) for 5 weeks prior because of a spinal (suspected ependymoma presenting with spinal bleeding and paraplegia). His body temperature peaked at 40.4 \u00b0C approximately 2 h after admittance to the ICU. Leukocyte counts were normal but C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were elevated (CRP 45.05 mg/ml, PCT 5.59 ng/ml). Several blood and BAL samples were taken for microbiological diagnosis. Anti-infective therapy was started with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Clarithromycin in accordance with the local standard. On the following day CT scan showed bipulmonary infiltrates and no signs of pulmonary embolism (Fig. 1). At this point adequate ventilation required high driving pressures (paO2/FiO2 77, pressure control ventilation, Pmax 32 mbar). Tidal volume goals were calculated with 6 ml/kg body weight. Prone positioning for about 19 h significantly improved the patient\u2019s oxygenation and ventilation settings (paO2/FiO2 207, pressure control ventilation, Pmax 24 mbar). On the second day we received the first results from the bronchoalveolar lavage. PCR for Pneumocystis jiroveci, Legionella species and Cytomegalovirus was positive. PCT levels peaked at 63.02 ng/ml and CRP levels at 56.18 mg/ml while leukocyte counts were remaining within normal range. Anti-infective therapy was changed to Primaquine, Clindamycin, Ganciclovir and Levofloxacin. Results from PCR and cultures 2 days later showed Pneumocystis jiroveci, Staphylococcus aureus/MSSA, Candida dubliniensis, Cytomegalovirus and Legionella pneumophila. Blood tests showed signs of a disseminated Cytomegalovirus infection with 13.800 copies per ml CMV DNA. Renal replacement therapy was started. On day 5 after admission to the ICU, the patient\u2019s condition was rapidly deteriorating (FiO2/paO2 50\u201360, pressure control ventilation, PEEP 14 mbar, Pmax 31, paCO2 66, pH 7.12, BE \u2212 7.8). Due to continuing severe septic shock (Lactat 8.3 mmol/l, Norepinephrine 1.5 \u03bcg/kg/min) and persistent risk of hypoxemia after interdisciplinary discussion extracorporal veno-venous oxygenation was established. In cases of septic shock extracorporal veno-arterial oxygenation is often limited due to higher heart time volumes in sepsis and developing harlequin phenomenon with insufficient systemic oxygenation. In these cases a veno-veno-arterial ECMO might be an option if the cardiac function is sufficient. After the start of veno-venous ECMO therapy, the patient stabilized slowly and the lactate levels decreased. There was no need for an additional arterial cannulation.\n",

In addition an antibody deficiency syndrome was treated with intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin\u00ae) substitution. FACS analysis showed a decreased subset of T-suppressor cells (CD3 + CD8+/CD45+) and NK Lymphocytes (CD16 + 56+/CD45+) (Fig. 2). On day 6, signs of hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation were developing with rapidly declining platelet count and coagulation parameters, in spite of repeated transfusion and substitution. Lactate levels were rising and CT scan now showed massive bipulmonary infiltration with multiple pulmonary embolism and signs of kidney and cerebral ischemia due to disseminated embolism. This was primarily interpreted as a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation but echocardiography was scheduled for the following day to rule out endocarditis and anticoagulation was switched from Heparin to Argatroban. Blood samples were sent to an extern laboratory to rule out HIT. Based on the impaired hemeostasis with severe thrombopenia (14.000/\u03bcl), biopsie on ECMO was abandoned and echocardiography postponed.\n",

Therefore the onset of antifungal therapy is an important issue. Based on the expert opinion of the European Society of Anesthesia Intensive Care Scientific Subcommittee [15] the decision pathway in this case was correct. Initially the colonization index was < 0.5; candida score < 3. PCR- and Serum-tests were negative for fungal infection. 1,3-Beta-D-Glucan was not applied. However, the interpretation of this marker in patients infected by pneumocystis may be challenging [16]. The serological test (Platelia\u00ae; Bio Rad; M\u00fcnchen) did not prove positive Aspergillus-Galaktomannan-Antigen until 2 days before the patient\u2019s death. In addition diagnosis of pulmonary mucormycosis by conventional culture may be difficult due to overgrowth. Microscopical examination of BAL may lead to misinterpretation due to contamination. Histopathological examination may be a valid option, although it is of risk in patients with anticoagulation and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation [8, 17]. Recently Jiang and coworkers suggested the liquid-based cytopathology to identify mucorales promptly in samples obtained by bronchial brushes, which could be a less invasive method to detect this infection promptly [13].",

There is no evidence but according to data obtained in the few hundred known cases of mucormycosis, history of poorly controlled diabetes in combination with impaired cell-mediated immune function including neutropenia are mainly the issue. Recent data suggests that T cells may play an important role in host defense to fungal disease [18, 19]. Like in our patient, lymphopenia may be an important indicator for the application of frequent fungal screening and fungal prophylaxis.",

In case of assumed mucor infection the decision for biopsy should be taken into account for ARDS patients with progressive lung inflammation of unknown origin when all standard samples fail to provide an edaquate explanation for the patients status, since the risk to die due to mucor may outweigh the risk of fatal bleeding due to the biopsy.
