The electrical properties of biological tissues can be determined by the technique of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with a very good time resolution. EIT generates two-dimensional images of the distribution of electrical impedance within a studied body section at rates approaching a few tens of EIT images/s. Until now, the imaging of lung ventilation has dominated the chest applications of EIT [2], nevertheless, a few examinations aiming at imaging pulmonary perfusion have been performed as well [1], [3]\u2013[6].",

In the present experiments, 16 X-ray transparent electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes (Blue Sensor BR-50-K, Medicotest A/S, \u00d8lstykke, Denmark) were placed around the boundary of a transverse thoracic plane lying approximately 1 cm below the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter.

The injection of the excitation currents was consecutively performed through all 16 adjacent electrode pairs. Each current application was followed by the voltage measurements between all adjacent electrodes except the driving ones. One complete cycle of current injections and voltage measurements was completed within 77 ms. A total of 1000 consecutive measuring cycles were performed during an individual EIT measurement, i.e., the duration of one measurement was 77 s.",

During administration through the distal catheter opening, only the blood flow through the lung region lying peripherally to the injection site was visualized. When the catheter balloon was inflated, the administration of the bolus through the proximal opening resulted in an image showing the blood flow through the lungs and the heart with a perfusion deficit in the blocked lung region. Bolus administration through the proximal catheter opening with a deflated balloon showed the undisturbed blood flow in the whole chest cross section.",

Not only are the electrical impedance changes associated with lung perfusion small but they are also masked and modulated by the much larger changes related to lung ventilation. In most of the EIT studies aimed at assessing lung perfusion, the ECG-triggered data acquisition was used for the period of 100\u2013200 cardiac cycles and the effect of ventilation was minimized by averaging [1], [3], [6]. The impedance changes occurring synchronously with the heart rate, usually termed as \u201cperfusion-related impedance changes,\u201d can also be separated from the ventilation-related ones by digital filtering [4], [5]. The other approach used to minimize the ventilation component of the impedance signal, used in the present experiments as well, is to acquire the EIT data during breath-holding.",

Moreover, the complex origin of the acquired impedance data does not allow to separate the true perfusion from other components contributing to the cardiac synchronous impedance changes. The use of an intravascular contrast material, which in the case of EIT perfusion imaging means an agent with either higher or lower conductivity than blood, could provide a large impedance signal related directly to pulmonary blood flow. Previous in vitro experiments have shown that EIT can follow the passage of an isotonic saline solution bolus through a tube placed in a tank filled with a solution with conductivity comparable to blood [16]. It was even demonstrated that the saline passage can be detected in the upper arm veins and in the cardiac region in one subject. Based on this approach, we have used the hypertonic saline solution applied as a contrast agent to follow local pulmonary perfusion in our experiments.",

The EBCT scans allowed us to exactly locate the passage of the administered EIT bolus contrast material in the chest cross section by using a radiopaque agent under identical experimental conditions.

The experiments indicate that EIT assessment of pulmonary perfusion and the detection of perfusion defects is possible. New functional EIT images visualizing the regional pulmonary blood flow were generated. In the present experiments, the peak impedance change on the bolus arrival in lungs was used for the simple identification of those lung regions where the indicator was carried to by the blood stream. However, the ability of EIT to follow the transit of a bolus through the pulmonary vascular system in terms of local time-impedance curves indicates that quantitative analysis of EIT data based on the indicator dilution principle may be attempted in the future. The calculation of the area under the time-impedance dilution curve which is inversely proportional with the flux as well as of other specific curve parameters like appearance time, appearance-to-peak time and mean transit time should be possible. Because EIT is able to produce images of lung ventilation [2], the present findings also indicate that multifunctional imaging of the lung function by EIT comparable with the isotope ventilation/perfusion scans may be aspired in the future. Functional EIT images have a similar resolution than the scintigraphic scans, however, their advantage is that they can be obtained at the bedside at low cost and without the use of radioactive tracers. At present it is too early to define the exact clinical perspective of EIT in this new indication with certainty.",
