The causative agent was later identified as a coronavirus and named SARS-CoV. The SARS outbreaks were at times characterised by several superspreading events\u2014eg, hotel-based transmission from one infected hotel guest to others who travelled to Canada, Singapore, and Vietnam.6 One large apartment complex-based outbreak of SARS was later found to be caused by aerosolisation of virus contaminated sewage.6\n",

By contrast, transmission of SARS-CoV did not readily occur during the prodromal period when those infected were mildly ill, and most transmission is thought to have occurred when infected individuals presented with severe illness, thus possibly making it easier to contain the outbreaks SARS-CoV caused, unlike the current outbreaks with COVID-19.6\n",
