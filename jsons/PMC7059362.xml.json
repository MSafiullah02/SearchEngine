Earlier patient weaning from mechanical ventilation is recommended to avoid complications of prolonged mechanical ventilation; however, premature weaning might result in extubation failure which is, independently, associated with poor outcomes [1]. Screening for eligibility is the first step in weaning process, followed by the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) [2]. Various indices should be checked carefully before starting SBT to ensure adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and airway reflexes [2]. However, nearly one-third of patients fail and are reintubated despite fulfillment of all the current weaning pre-requisites [3, 4]. The absence of the ideal weaning parameter till now might be due to the heterogeneity of critically ill patients which impairs the predictive accuracy of the available indices in different patient subgroups.",

            "text": "Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in cardiac factors, such as lung congestion and hypervolemia, as contributing elements in weaning failure [5, 6]. Various measures had been previously reported for evaluation of volume status before the SBT aiming to identify patients who would benefit from diuretic therapy [5]. Most of the previously used measures required either frequent blood sampling, such as brain natriuretic peptide [7], or expert operator, such as echocardiography [8]. The electrical cardiometry-derived thoracic fluid content (TFC) is measured through the impedance cardiography technology; TFC is assessed through the changes in the impedance of thoracic tissue to the electric current [9]. Thoracic fluid content represents the whole (extravascular, intravascular, and intrapleural) fluid component in the thorax; thus, TFC was postulated to provide an estimation of the extravascular lung water. Our group had recently reported that TFC could detect pulmonary edema in parturients with pre-eclampsia [10]. We had also found that TFC correlated perfectly with extravascular lung water in pre-eclamptic patients [10]. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of TFC, as an estimate of lung congestion, in predicting weaning outcome in critically ill patients.",

Measurement of the TFC depends on the impedance cardiography phenomenon which changes according to the resistance of thoracic contents to electric current [9]. The presence of lung congestion is an important cause for weaning failure especially in cardiac patients [12]. Lung congestion may also be triggered by the SBT due to the increase in the left ventricular afterload [13], as well as the increase in the venous return and the subsequent increase in the cardiac preload [14]. The TFC is an index for both extra and intra-vascular thoracic fluid; however, the TFC showed good correlation with ultrasound in estimation of extravascular lung water [10]. Therefore, high TFC value could be an indirect measure of lung congestion and/or hypervolemia which is a known risk factor for failed weaning. This assumption is supported by previous reports in which the TFC was able to follow up the hemodynamic effect of diuretics [15] and to evaluate the thoracic fluid in patients with heart failure [16]. The TFC was also able to follow up the change in the patient body weight and the volume of the ultrafiltrate removed during hemodialysis [17]. The TFC showed good correlation with fluid balance during cardiac surgery [18].",

In the last few years, TFC had been also measured using the newer electric cardiometry technology. The electrical cardiometry-based TFC showed useful results in evaluation of the volume status of patients undergoing autologous blood transfusion [9]. In late preterm and term newborn, TFC correlated with the occurrence of respiratory distress in the first 24 h after birth [19]. Our group had recently evaluated TFC in pre-eclamptic mothers and reported that TFC could detect mothers with high risk for pulmonary edema [10]. In the current study, we evaluated TFC in another population, the critically ill patients, and found that the TFC could be a useful tool for detection of weaning failure in cardiac patients.",

            "text": "Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation is usually a challenging decision in critical care practice. Premature failed weaning leads to prolonged intubation and increases morbidity and mortality [21]. On the other side, delayed weaning is also associated with serious complications [22]. Daily assessment for readiness-to-wean had been a routine recommendation for every mechanically ventilated patient [23]; however, this approach might be associated with premature extubation leading to weaning failure; thus, meticulous research is continuously conducted for reaching accurate parameters for predicting weaning failure. Various parameters had been previously reported as predictors of lung congestion-related weaning failure such as pulmonary artery occlusion pressure which requires the presence of pulmonary artery catheter [14], impaired left ventricular systolic function [8], and impaired left ventricular diastolic function [24, 25]; both are assessed using echocardiography. Brain natriuretic peptide was reported as another predictor for weaning outcome [7]. In our study, we introduced a simpler parameter that could be measured without the need for blood samples nor operator experience. Thoracic fluid content has many advantages over the previously mentioned predictors for being easily measured by younger physicians, or even by paramedics. Moreover, TFC could be easily interpreted with no inter-observer variability because it is presented in numerical values which have minimal fluctuations. We believe that there is no single parameter that can predict weaning outcome; therefore, assessment of readiness-to-wean should include different factors which evaluate respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status of the patient. Thoracic fluid content can help the process of patient weaning especially in cardiac patients who represents 25% of the patients with failed extubation [12]. An elevated TFC could be an alarming sign in cardiac patients to initiate diuretic therapy before extubation.",
