Manifestations are vesicles on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, and on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and buttocks. Although other types of enterovirus (EV), such as coxsackie virus A4\u2013A7, B2\u2013B5, and EV18 are related to HFMD, human EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the main pathogens (Bruu, 2003). Severe cases with neurological and cardiopulmonary complications, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis, are mainly caused by EV71 (Chong et al., 2003, McMinn et al., 2001, Wang et al., 1999, Weng et al., 2010). In addition, EV71 is associated with higher mortality rates.",

It has been reported that different types of sample, early or multiple sampling may affect the positive rate of RT-PCR (Singh et al., 2002). Immune detection of IgM antibody against EV71 or CA16 using serum samples, which is meaningful for early diagnosis, has been established (Hong et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2010). However, the performance of the methods had not been fully evaluated. Recent studies have indicated that some antiviral proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines were increasing after EV infection, especially in severe HFMD cases, and have been associated with certain adverse outcomes (Chung et al., 2008, Khong et al., 2011, Lin et al., 2002). The strong or abnormal activation of the immune system in severe HFMD cases may affect the method choice concerning pathogen detection using either molecular methods or immune detection focus on IgM antibody.",

            "text": "As for the incidence of MP and CP, no significant difference was found between the mild and severe groups, which suggests that the severity of HFMD does not affect MP and CP detection. However, MP detection was much more common (10.0%) in patients aged less than 1 year compared with other age groups. The incidence of both MP and CP was lower than in some other reports (Defilippi et al., 2008, Kese et al., 2002, Mc et al., 2009); this may be due to the fact that we did not focus on children with acute respiratory infection (Defilippi et al., 2008) or on patients in winter and spring when there are more likely to be epidemics of CP or MP (Kese et al., 2002, Mc et al., 2007, Mc et al., 2009). Furthermore, it may be that the pharyngeal swabs special for virus preservation decreased the MP/CP detection rate compared with sputum samples used in other studies, and the single sampling may also decreased detection rate. Some other studies reported that children younger than 3 years, which are the majority in our study, are rarely infected by MP or CP (Almasri et al., 2011, Kamata et al., 2011).",

Therefore, a hypothesis was proposed that this difference was a result of stronger activation of acute immune reaction in the severe patients. Earlier studies have indicated that increased proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion was detected after EV or respiratory pathogen infection (Cello et al., 1996, Chung et al., 2008, H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen et al., 2003, Khong et al., 2011, Lin et al., 2002). Studies have suggested that the enhanced expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF is associated with life-threatening complications in severe HFMD cases (Lin et al., 2002, Lin et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2003). Some cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, transforming growth factor, and GM-CSF, have been reported to have specific or non-specific antiviral effects (Ank et al., 2006, Brooks et al., 2006, Hong et al., 2012, Huang et al., 2011). A recent study indicated that EV71 infection increased the expression of IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10). High level of IP-10 was found in the plasma of severe HFMD patients with encephalitis, with functions to enhance viral clearance, increase IFN-\u03b3 expression and boost the infiltration of CD8 T cells (Shen et al., 2013). Therefore, such a strong immunoreaction not only plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD but also might affect the choice of the detection method. In this study, seven cytokines were much higher in severe cases than in mild cases. This finding supports our hypothesis and also indicates that detecting the levels of these cytokines may be utilized as an auxiliary diagnostic method to evaluate disease progression.",

Therefore, detection rate of EV an RV by RT-PCR was decreased.

Practical RT-PCR methods have been used in worldwide (de Crom et al., 2011, Song et al., 2011, Watkins-Riedel et al., 2002). However, enhanced immunoreaction in severe HFMD may eliminate EV and RV quickly from the nasopharynx, thus decreasing the detection rate by RT-PCR. Alternatively, studies indicated that the positive rates of IgM antibody for CA16 and EV71 could get more than 90% at day 7 after onset (Xu et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2011). The rapid generation of such antibodies was confirmed again in present study and, on the other hand, clarified the characteristics of immune response to EV. In view of this, RT-PCR detection combined with serum immunoassays, such as ELISA and cytokine profile detection, could be used for the early diagnosis of EV infection, especially in cases of severe HFMD.",
