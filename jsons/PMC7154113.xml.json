            "text": "Several reviews, like the updated survey from Newman and Cragg (2016), pointed to the fact that many drugs on the market are from natural origin; these authors stated that, out of the 1,328 new chemical entities approved as drugs between 1981 and 2016, only 359 were purely of synthetic origin. From the remaining ones, 326 were \u201cbiological\u201d entities (peptides of more than 50 residues, including therapeutic antibodies), and 94 were vaccines. A little less than half of those new drugs (549, exactly) were from natural origin or derived inspired from natural compounds. Furthermore, in the anticancer area, out of the 136 approved nonbiological compounds from the same period (1981\u20132014), only 23 were purely synthetic (i.e. not derived from natural compounds nor natural compounds themselves) (Newman and Cragg, 2016). Natural origin can have different definitions, and these authors accounted for three categories: unaltered natural (pure) products; defined mixture of natural products (NP) and natural product derivatives isolated from plants or other living organisms as fungi, sponges, lichens, or microorganisms; and products modified by medicinal chemistry. There are many examples: anticancer drugs such as docetaxel (Taxotere\u2122), paclitaxel (Taxol\u2122), vinblastine, podophyllotoxin (Condylin\u2122), or etoposide; steroidal hormones such as progesterone, norgestrel, or cortisone; cardiac glycosides such as digitoxigenin; antibiotics like penicillin, streptomycin, and cephalosporins [see IA Ross for more examples (1999)]. Furthermore, Rodrigues et al. (2016) pointed to the fact that fragments derived from natural structures are a source of diverse molecules from which new drugs can be designed, thanks to the fragment-based drug discovery approach (Erlanson et al., 2016; Mortenson et al., 2018; Y\u00f1igez-Gutierrez and Bachmann, 2019).",

            "text": "Besides the understanding of pathological processes, the source of molecules has been a main concern for the pharmaceutical industry. Vast libraries of compounds have been established in order to feed the research. For example, in midsize pharmaceutical companies, it is common to find libraries from 30,000 up to 500,000 compounds, while for big pharmas, the numbers are more in the 500,000 to several million ranges (Macarron et al., 2011). To our knowledge this is also the case for the National Chinese Compound Library in Shanghai, China (http://en.cncl.org.cn/). Finally, national or transnational efforts have been reported to create such depositories of compounds for the use of screening programs from the Academy: see Horvath et al. (2014) in Europe and Thornburg et al. (2018) for the NIH/NCI effort. In addition, vendors are also selling libraries of compounds composed of a \u201clarge\u201d diversity that they build according to different principles (Boss et al., 2017). Several publications deal with how the compounds are chosen (Langer et al., 2009), if they are following Lipinski rules (Lipinski et al., 2001; Lipinski, 2003) or not, if they are virtual (Glaab, 2016) or real, if they are systematically tested on all the targets, how they can be organized in subclasses of compounds designed to potentially interact with channels, receptors, or enzymes, etc. Furthermore, the composition of the library in relation with the main categories of molecules\u2014small synthetic compounds, drug-like organic compounds, peptides, proteins, sugars, nucleosides, or natural compounds\u2014can greatly vary in function of the \u201cPharma company culture\u201d, that is to say, the compounds that have already been synthesized in a given company as well as the \u201csensitivity\u201d of the medicinal chemists and screening people.",

Because of the traditions existing in the uses of botanicals and medicinal plants, this empirical knowledge has accumulated for ages and passed through generations. Modern pharmacology has explored and validated probably only a minor part of this knowledge through attempts of rationalizing the use of plants as sources of drugs. This first possible approach would be a way to guide some drug discovery projects. Another totally different approach based on the use of high-throughput screening (HTS) emerged one or two decades ago. It aimed at exploring systematically the immense chemical diversity in secondary metabolites and was based on the technological developments of discovery tools such as miniaturization and automation (Atanasov et al., 2015). In this sense, the increase of the amount of compounds was tested simultaneously, and the scientific rationalization of the selection of those compounds, thanks to the growing capacities of chemo-informatic approaches (Larsson et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2007), emerged as trends in HTS.",

Plants are collected in precise geo-localized sites. The collection may include the whole plant or any part such as leaves, stems, bark, seeds, or roots. Then, the botanical material is dried and powdered using mechanical means, such as grounders. Those powders are then extracted with solvents at different temperatures or of increasing polarities with sequential extraction procedures in the cases when, for example, the chemistry of the active compounds is unknown. These first steps are important to consider as the extraction method might influence the chemical composition of the extract and consequently, its biological activity.",

These biological tests are often a cloned enzyme catalytic assay, a receptor binding assay, a protein\u2013protein interaction assay or even a whole pathway (Ishibashi and Ohtsuki, 2008; Xie et al., 2018), to name but a few. Biological testing targeting whole-cells was also reported against cancer cells (Mazzio et al., 2014; Kant et al., 2016), virus-infected cells (Yi et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2012), or microorganisms (Correia et al., 2008; Figueroa-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; St-Pierre et al., 2018).

Each fraction (typically around ten) will be tested in turn in the same assay, and the active fractions are subjected to one or several extra fractionations, often using alternative chromatographic conditions.",

Indeed, robots can handle several thousands of tests during a workday. However, the initial enthusiasm for HTS (Harvey and Cree, 2010; Sarker and Nahar, 2012) when applied to crude extract libraries in targeted assays systems has been facing several issues as stated recently by Thornburg et al. (2018). In fact, HTS techniques do not really modify the discovery process itself. For example, starting with 2,000 extracts\u2014which is a modest number considering (a) the number of plants species available and (b) the number of compounds in an HTS campaign\u2014might result into 10% actives, in the best case. Thus, the next step would be 200 hydrophobic columns, with the collection of about 10 fractions per chromatography, and then 2,000 tests. As exemplified, the real bottleneck in this whole process is the parallel fractionations of the actives; as of today, only partial progresses in their automatization have been reported over the last years (Sharma and Gupta, 2015).",

The group of metabolic profiling approaches has a more detached relationship with bioactivity as they are not focused on compounds. They were developed during the last 10\u201315 years in plant natural products. Using highly sensitive and reproducible analytical methods, they allow the correlation between chemical profile (qualitative or quantitative) and bioactivity data (Zampieri et al., 2017; Parrot et al., 2018; Wolfender et al., 2019) with recent progress in the field of data analysis and integration at the extract level (Wolfender et al., 2019). Finally, the group of direct phytochemical isolation approaches focuses on the comprehensive chemical characterization of the plant extract and the isolation of novel scaffolds without immediately evaluating their bioactivity.",

The probability still exists that a plant collected on a given location would not be there the next time around, especially the whole plant. If bioactivities associated with this species are discovered during the process, it could be hard to find again the same plant population. In those cases, two choices are possible: to look for this species in another location or to look in the same location for a closely related species with the help of botanists. Neither solution is entirely satisfactory: the change of harvest location can imply change(s) in secondary metabolite production as their biosynthesis generally depends on the control by both biotic and abiotic factors. Furthermore, the other species of the same genus might very well express different genes coding for proteins acting slightly differently in biosynthetical pathways leading to different compounds or to the same compounds synthetized in different proportions (see below for discussion on diversity). Moreover, if the collected species are not properly reported following the correct taxonomy, the harvest might be even more difficult to reproduce: thereby, a table of correspondence between the names mentioned in this review (and used in the articles of origin) and the accepted plant species names is provided in the supplementary data (\nTable S1\n).",

Most of those events are not discussed in publications, obviously. Therefore, this bioguided approach, existing with small variations\u2013\u2013mostly technical\u2013\u2013is paved with difficulties that are more than often discouraging at least for an industry or for big programs (Nothias et al., 2018).",

(2015), one of the key starting points is the choice of the pharmacological assay used for the screening. The fact that the targeted disease is obviously more complex than the molecular target it has been simplified to, is universally recognized, but alternative approaches remain elusive or still difficult to set up. For example, the disease could also be simplified by a phenotypic change of a cell originating from a diseased organ using the stem cell differentiation approaches (Bedut et al., 2016). After treating such a model with NP extracts\u2014having potentially hundreds of compounds\u2014reverse pharmacology should allow recognizing the actual target of the NP compound as the lysed cell extract is chromatographed to retain the target proteins (Raut et al., 2017). Nevertheless, cellular phenotypic changes are extremely complex to understand, and this approach has been more than once extremely frustrating despite some successes, outside of the NP recognition area (Nosjean et al., 2000; Graves et al., 2002). Actually, another limitation of this approach is linked with working with complex mixtures in NP discovery as sometimes several compounds could contribute synergistically to the global action on a disease: like for example the compounds (at least three of them) derived from leaves of Salvia miltiorrhiza (red sage) that are reported to act at many different levels of liver fibrosis (Ma et al., 2019). This kind of observation would strongly argue against the strategy described in here aiming at the discovery of the main pure drug-like compound in a plant extract. In summary, such approaches (phenotype screening and reverse pharmacology) would require disease models that are far from being the current available systems.",

That is to say, that in order to benefit patients, critical amounts of a potential drug need to be considered, and the access to the identified NP as well as its availability are critical. For example, at the start of the Taxol\u2122 story, the compound was isolated from Taxus brevifolia bark. Ten kilograms of bark was necessary to obtain 2 g of the pure compound needed for the treatment of one patient. For the clinical study, 12,000 trees were cut down to obtain the 2 kg necessary for the studies leading to the approval of the compound. In fact, the antineoplastic Taxotere\u2122 is now produced by hemi-synthesis from the precursor 10-deacetyl-baccatine III, which is isolated from leaves of Taxus baccata. In other words, an alternative had to be found to the initial procedure taking a too heavy toll on trees of the initial species. Another interesting figure dealing this time with herbals is the annual demand of ginseng roots around 50,000 tons (Mathur et al., 1999). This kind of figures embodies a major limitation to new drugs originating from NP that is sometimes disregarded by research laboratories: there is a real challenge for the use of NP in reaching a tonnage compatible with the drug market.",

Indeed, structural characterization as well as biological testing can be made more difficult. Nevertheless, many progresses have been done in this area: in relation with structural characterization, for example, considering the growing sensitivity of the analytical methods and instruments, it will not be long until the barrier of the microgram for the determination of the structure of a compound would be reached. The analytical techniques for structural elucidation of an unknown compound are based on a mixture of spectroscopy (infrared, UV, Raman), mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (proton and C13 NMR). Nice examples of such task are described in various publications (Baker et al., 1990; El-Elimat et al., 2013) while difficulties are also discussed by Amagata (2010). Advances in NMR techniques were reviewed (Breton and Reynolds, 2013; Harvey et al., 2015; Gomes et al., 2018), and several examples of compounds for which structures were solved with mass of pure compounds lower than 100 \u00b5g were reported. In fact, the situation could be different from one plant to another or from one organ/tissue to another, even in a single plant species. Therefore, even if we can identify the many compounds in each sample while being able to establish their structure, it would be more straightforward to consider the feasibility of the systematic compendium of all the plant chemical components.",

It is especially the case when hemi-synthesis is to be used to perform the NP\u2019s industrial production. Instead of using a vital organ of the plant in which the compound is in fair concentration, one tries to find a precursor of the product in a renewable part of the plant, like the leaves. For the hemi-synthesis of Taxol\u2122, 30 km2 of T. brevifolia fields in the Yunan province (China) consists in the main source of precursor for (http://www.yewcare.com/index.php cited in Malik et al., 2011). Certainly, the use of a renewable source of the natural product is desirable, and often enough that such sustainable and profitable solutions are found, as proven by the 40% of the available drugs in the Pharmacopeia that are from natural origin (Cragg et al., 1997; Newman et al., 2003; Newman and Cragg, 2007; Da Silva and Meijer, 2012; Newman and Cragg, 2012; Newman and Cragg, 2016). Many examples of drugs from natural origin exist, one being found in the still common use of plant sapogenins, alkaloids, or sterols for the production of steroids for human drugs (sex hormones, corticosteroids, contraceptive drugs, etc.). Other examples involving hemi-syntheses modifying the NP can be given: quinine (at least 100 tons per year), camptothecin (Asano et al., 2009), cocaine, camphor, vitamin B12, etc. Interestingly, at the other end of the spectrum, extremely simple molecules also of NP origin like salicylic acid for pain (J. B. Jin et al., 2017) or metformin for diabetes (Bailey, 2017) see their production reach industrial scales by total syntheses using standard organic chemistry.",

            "text": "Screened compounds need to be diverse in shape and electrostatics to match any of the 3,300+ binding site, as listed in the pocketome (Kufareva et al., 2012), as well as diverse in structure to allow thorough optimization. It is noteworthy that the probability of identifying a hit considerably decreases with the increasing complexity of the ligand (Hann et al., 2001). The complexity of a molecule increases with the size and the atom connectivity. As a result, the more complex they are, the greater the number of molecules one should screen. Statistical analyses have been performed on natural products to study their chemical diversity (Firn and Jones, 2003; Hong, 2011), molecular properties (Feher and Schmidt, 2003; Quinn et al., 2008), scaffold diversity (Lee and Schneider, 2001; Grabowski et al., 2008; Yongye et al., 2012), and coverage of the chemical space (Ros\u00e9n et al., 2009a). Comparisons between NP and other compound collections (Henkel et al., 1999; Lee and Schneider, 2001; Grabowski and Schneider, 2007; Ros\u00e9n et al., 2009a) have also been performed, showing that NP differ from drugs and synthetic compounds in several aspects. NP are considered complex due to their number of asymmetric centers, their number of Sp3 carbon ratio in rings, and their number of ring junctions. Indeed, NP display in general more chiral centers than drugs, although their number of chiral centers to number to carbon atoms ratio may be lower (Gu et al., 2013; Skinnider et al., 2017). Although there is no clear evidence that this complexity is necessary for their biological activity (Firn and Jones, 2003), it greatly impacts their specificity (Clemons et al., 2011). NP also display a great diversity in their scaffolds (Lee and Schneider, 2001; Grabowski et al., 2008; Yongye et al., 2012). For instance, the GreenPharma database (Do et al., 2015; Gally et al., 2017) contains 55,185 Murcko frameworks (Bemis and Murcko, 1996) for 302,000 natural products (18.3%), whereas NCI and ChEMBL databases contain a little of less NP-derived scaffolds: 13.1 and 13.6% respectively.",

In addition, these compound libraries are required to be constantly enriched with compounds filling the gaps in the molecular space. Interestingly, Harvey et al. (2015) stated: \u201cdiversity within biologically relevant chemical space is more important than library size\u201d, this biologically relevant chemical space being defined by protein-binding sites for potential ligands. Another point emphasized by these authors is that while the commercially available chemical space is wider than the explored natural product universe\u2014the first one is evaluated to 5.109 compounds, while the second only represents 3.105 compounds (Banerjee et al., 2015)\u2014NP are intrinsically more diverse. A major component of this comparison is that NP are more complex, from a chemical point of view, leading to greater shape diversity. However, NP might not be the best compounds to screen in HTS campaigns due to their complexity (\u201cbest\u201d in a drug-discovery perspective). Indeed, their probability of being active on a random target is lower, and their chemical tractability is far from optimal. Although NP decently occupy the biologically relevant chemical space, and 80% meet the criteria to be considered as drug like compounds (Harvey et al., 2015), their complexity might be the bottleneck during the optimization phase of the lead compounds.",

Nevertheless, not only the design of those libraries, but also the design of the assays and the understanding of the pathways that are responsible for the targeted pathologies need to be relevant and well understood. In summary, the main idea is that if compounds as chemically diverse as possible are necessary to feed drug discovery programs, then a great deal of efforts should still be invested in the exploration of natural chemical diversity because, in this particular context, natural chemistry is more advanced than organic chemistry. After this introduction on the background of NP in the area of drug discovery, we aim at discussing and showing the extent of natural chemical diversity (Natural Chemical Diversity) as well as the strategies of having the potential to embrace this diversity (Different Strategies to Benefit From This Diversity) based on an extensive survey of recent publications. A preliminary survey on the main origins of recently reported natural compound structures\u2019 literature was performed by taking a complete volume from a journal that is considered as a gold standard in NP (J. Natural Products, 2018, vol 81). Then three different tables mentioning the species of origin and the type of compounds newly reported in 2017 and 2018 in several journals selected for their specialization in the area (like for example Journal of natural products, Planta medica, Tetrahedron Letters or Natural products communications) were built upon this sampling. Finally, Different Strategies to Benefit From This Diversity offers some strategic and technical proposals based on our interpretations of the trends of the field supported by recent ad hoc literature.",

Although plants were our main focus, we thought it might be useful to also consider other sources of diversity from other living kingdoms as they also consist of very interesting sources to explore and because some of them are somehow related to plants: it is especially the case for compounds which functions in plants are related with defense (Bednarek and Osbourn, 2009) and other ecological interactions as compounds \u201coptimized by evolution\u201d according to Gunatilaka in its review on natural products from plant-associated microorganisms (Gunatilaka, 2006). Among the 240 papers that were reviewed, a handful described compounds isolated from venoms and toxins originating from marine organisms and animals (insects, snakes, and alike). Then, a few other papers described compounds coming from microorganisms as can be seen in \nTable 2\n. Microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, were traditionally important sources of antibiotics and are still a source of new peptides (Xue et al., 2018), but here compounds other than peptides can also be found that are close to secondary metabolites naturally synthesized in those cells. New peptides are more often described in journals specialized in peptide chemistry and pharmacology, even if their source is a living organism. \nTable 3\n gives examples of compounds isolated from lichen, fungi, and sponges. The chemical diversity of these compounds is interesting but, as of today, growing lichen or sponges is not so much reported and might turn out to be difficult on a larger scale. On the other hand, secondary metabolites synthetized by microorganisms growing in extreme conditions might also be difficult to obtain in large quantities. It would be therefore interesting to dig deeper in this area, as it has been done elsewhere for other purposes: biotechnological (Kruger et al., 2018; Mokashe et al., 2018), industrial (Sarmiento et al., 2015), pharmaceutical (Irwin, 2010; Karker et al., 2016; Patel, 2016; Oliveira et al., 2018), or ecological (Casillo et al., 2018; Orellana et al., 2018).

This ecological understanding of plant secondary metabolite diversification also contributes to the anticipation that the more plants species are described, the more diversity is to be found in the end-products of these pathways along with possibly valuable \u201cnew\u201d compounds. A recent interesting study (Henz Ryen and Backlund, 2019) discussed the chemical Angiosperms\u2019 diversity among natural products and some of these evolutionary mechanisms leading to diversification of chemical structures in function of the group of secondary metabolites (flavonoids, tropane alkaloids, sesquiterpene lactones, and betalains).

Of course, constraints of collection make some of these parts more suitable than others. Our survey in \nTable 4\n details for each one of the 165 reported plant species the plant part from which it was isolated. \nFigure 3A\n summarizes the proportion of new compounds reported in different plant parts in our survey. For comparison, \nFigure 3B\n shows similarly the organs/parts of origin of the active compounds reported from the 49 plants described in Ross work (Ross, 1999; Ross, 2001). It seems that in both cases, most of the studies are done on leaves. On the other hand, it is not clear, on a systematic basis, if what was found in the other organs can be found as well\u2014even in small quantities\u2014in the leaves.

It seems interesting to emphasize that it does not necessarily mean that it is the main component or a major component of this plant part. It can be accumulated in superior amounts in other tissues of the same plant. Indeed, in plant descriptions such as those in Ross work (Ross, 1999; Ross, 2001), the author described the way plants are used in traditional medicine. The different parts of a given genus can be used alone or in mixtures in preparations ranging from infusion, maceration, decoction, juice, dried powder, or even fresh organs (fruits, leaves) ingested as such. Astonishingly, those recipes were collected from scattered geographic places. This last observation suggests that traditional medicines around the world independently found similar remedies to similar diseases and sometimes with the use of related plant species.",

Moore et al. (2014) pointed out in particular the plant ontogeny, but also genetic and environmental variations as major sources of diversity for plant secondary metabolites. The existence of chemotypes is another example of this intraspecific chemo-diversity well described for example in plants producing essential oils. Factors like moisture, salinity, temperature, or nutrition levels are known to influence the essential oil production (Sangwan et al., 2001), and the genotype could also significantly influence the chemotype as it was shown recently for Valeriana jatamansi Jones (He et al., 2018). The biosynthesis of natural products can also differ in function of the different individuals from the same population. It is the case, for example, when these compounds are related to antimicrobial activity as summarized by Bednarek and Osbourn (2009) in their perspective article on chemical diversity linked with plant defense: these compounds can be synthetized constitutively as part of normal plant development\u2014and stored in specialized tissues\u2014or synthetized in response to pathogenic challenges through the activation of the transcription of specific genes of the corresponding biosynthetic pathways.",

And even within a defined group, the diversity can be impressive: for example, the terpenoid family is suspected to contain at least 50,000 different molecules (Kirby and Keasling, 2009) while at least 12,000 flavonoids have been described (Henz Ryen and Backlund, 2019).

Nevertheless, these compounds might only be slightly different from each other in terms of skeletons as illustrated in the following example: the compounds which structures are shown in \nFigure 4\n were recently isolated from six different species of Euphorbia. They are all diterpenoids that slightly differ in their structures: ent-abietane derivatives (structures Z1 and Z2) (C.-J. Wang et al., 2017), gaditanone (structure AA) (Flores-Giubi et al., 2017), ingenane derivatives (structure AB) (Zhang et al., 2018), premyrsinane and tigliane derivatives (structure AC) (Nothias et al., 2017), dideoxyphorbol ester (structure AD) (Esposito et al., 2017), sooneuphoramine (structure AE) (Gao and Aisa, 2017), jatrophane analog (structure AF) (R\u00e9dei et al., 2018), and other abietane derivative (structure AG) (Wei et al., 2017). These compounds all originated from the same biosynthetic pathways where the cyclization reactions of the precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate and several rearrangements allow many structural variants of diterpenoids to be produced. It is interesting to notice that despite a homology in term of basic scaffold (a phorbol ring system with some rearrangements), all the compounds are extremely different from each other from a chemical point of view.",

In our view, it seems important to gather as many compounds as possible inside a chemical series, even if the diversity seems to be futile, because, by setting the minimum results at a poor but significant level, such as 1 to 10 \u00b5M (depending on the molecular target) hits could be found, and even minor differences in structures can lead to new leads.

            "text": "However, it is a fact that the structures presented in \nFigure 6\n, even if they are almost randomly chosen, are different from what provides the current state of the art in medicinal chemistry. This is not really surprising when considering that 83% of core ring scaffolds shown in natural products cannot be found in libraries of synthetic compounds (Harvey et al., 2015). It should be reminded that part of the interest in \u201cdiscovering\u201d such structures, if they have any biological activities, resides in our capacity to use medicinal chemistry to translate such complex structures in simpler molecules amenable to the industrial production. At the same time, those structures might bear activity towards proteins, the inhibition of which has not been reached yet, with our current access to chemical synthons. This has been reported and discussed according to two points of view: (a) the natural compound-derived fragments (Rodrigues et al., 2016) and (b) the list of compounds issued from natural skeletons: what Newman and Cragg (2016) called NP derivatives in which 268 out of 1,328 new drugs can be found. Among the classical examples, there are vincristine and vinblastine as part of vinca-alkaloids (Zhou and Rahmani, 1992), statins (Sirtori, 2014), glifozins (Burson and Moran, 2015), and ingenol mebutate (Alchin, 2014). It should be reminded here that the current process is moving more from \u201csimple\u201d hits\u2014from whatever origin\u2014to more complex molecules by means of medicinal chemistry decoration of these synthons. The process of lead hopping, as defined by Krueger et al. (2009) and Chakka et al. (2017), should theoretically permit to mimic one complex structure by another, simpler one. All this body of techniques and theories should be put together at work in order to gain new powerful compounds from new, NP-based approaches (Y\u00f1igez-Gutierrez and Bachmann, 2019).",

            "text": "Nevertheless, if the literature provides us with some very well-described examples of such tasks, it remains to be seen if these techniques are universal. In other words, what has been described to be possible to obtain a \u201clarge scale\u201d plant cell culture is not necessarily applicable to the next cell culture of a different plant, and a fortiori, of a different organ of the same plant species. What has been considered as a promising approach remains in some cases a challenge, as no experimental process has been developed\u2014or published\u2014with a general usage purpose. Thus, the perfectly described process to obtain stem-derived callus or leaf-derived callus producing anticancer phenolic compounds from Fagonia indica (Khan et al., 2016) is only partially similar to the process to obtain callus from fruit pulp of varieties of apple producing high triterpenic acids (Verardo et al., 2017) or the process to obtain callus originating from seeds of Abronia nana (Kim et al., 2014), a desert plant found in North America to produce massive amount of boeravinone Y (Lee et al., 2018) or even callus from Scrophularia striata for the production of acteoside (Khanpour-Ardestani et al., 2015). As seen above, many examples can be found in the literature, but the remaining question is how much the methodology varied from one example to the next in order to obtain such callus and then to obtain such cell suspensions producing the desired compound. Some general procedures for the establishment of dedifferentiated plant cell suspension cultures exist (Mustafa et al., 2011; Eibl et al., 2018) but with many specific adaptations in the function of species, organs of origins, and culture conditions. Probably because the authors concentrated mainly on the productivity and yield of the targeted compound and not on a larger picture applicable to a more general view of accessing and testing the chemical diversity of plants. If one considers the natural diversity lying in the plant species from our environment as a source of \u201cnew\u201d chemicals, it would be wonderful to rely on a methodology universal enough to collect the biological material just once (or a very few times) and then, to rationalize the culture of the cells originating from the specific plant organ (leaves, stems, roots, etc.). The interest on these cell cultures is that the cells would be able to biosynthesize a large variety of compounds in quantities large enough to isolate and identify compounds with pharmacological activity and completely characterize them. At that stage, the culture size can be customized by expanding from several liters to several tens of liters of cell culture (hundreds if the initial results are promising and more biomass is needed to go on with testing). Finally, even modifications of culture conditions could work at enhancing chemical diversity (Jozwiak et al., 2013) or at least variations within the proportions of different secondary metabolites (Jozwiak et al., 2013; Akbari et al., 2018; Saad et al., 2018).",

In such cases, an idea of the possible diversity of those sources is given. A compendium of some plant compositions had been done by I.A. Ross (Ross, 1999; Ross, 2001). Such inventory organized in a global database would greatly facilitate the access to the diversity of secondary metabolites of plants, for example. It would somewhat ease any strategy based on chemotaxonomy by describing better the filiations/relationships between the biosynthetical pathways in a different genus and by facilitating the access to some types of chemical skeletons in renewable naturally producing sources such as leaves or fruits. Furthermore, \nTable 4\n indicates, in our view, the way the literature can be compiled from all the available sources to build a database based only on published articles describing one or several compounds from plant parts. In this line, the remarkable paper of Solyomv\u00e1ry et al. (2017) reviews the available literature on the compounds from the dibenzylbutyrolactone lignan family and describes some 91 compounds of this chemical family from their origin in terms of plant species and plant parts.",

Indeed, it is the completion of such a compendium that is the real challenge, and the experience of the few already existing NP databases exemplifies that challenge. For example the NAPRALERT experience (https://napralert.org) gathering data from more than 200,000 scientific papers is very informative: comprehensive coverage is claimed from 1975 to 2004 while only 20% of the global data is covered from 2005 due to budgetary constraints. Organisms, compounds, activities, or authors can be searched. In fact, the last decade has seen the development of several databases providing systematic collection of information that focuses on natural compounds themselves, offering the possibility of searching structure, source, and mechanisms of action of the searched compounds. For example, DEREP-NP is a database that compiles structural data (Zani and Carroll, 2017). An interesting review from Xie et al. (2015) allows the comparison of fourteen of these databases focusing on NP, balancing their advantages and disadvantages. Among them, the updated version of a 2006 database SuperNatural II is a public resource (http://bioinformatics.charite.de/supernatural) with more than 325,500 natural compounds, offering 3D structure and conformers (Banerjee et al., 2015) which seems to outperform many others (Harvey et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2015). Another source of natural compounds is also the Greenpharma collection (www.greenpharma.com/products/compound-librairies/#GPNDB) (Do et al., 2015; Gally et al., 2017).",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, one of the major requirements to this approach is to understand the pathways through which a particular compound is biosynthesized, thanks to the activity of a series of enzymes involved in a particular plant part. Within this last approach, the focus in plants is more on their capacity to synthetize unique scaffolds than on the end-products themselves. Indeed, the use of the recent integrative approaches based on \u201cOmic\u201d analyses (metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomic, and genomics) can be of great value. Indeed, knowing the precursors and intermediates through the biochemical status of a tissue, identifying the key enzymes and the limiting steps of the pathways, monitoring indirectly the function of the genes involved in these pathways and their regulation will contribute to decipher the biosynthetic routes in planta (Cheallaigh et al., 2018; Scossa et al., 2018). The relative ease at which one can now obtain large-scale data has facilitated the analyses at the level of the whole metabolic network (Paddon and Keasling, 2014; Ikram and Simonsen, 2017). For example, large amounts of transcriptomic data are now easier to access as stated by Owen et al. (2017), making possible the identification of multistep pathways by coexpression analyses or untargeted metabolomics. Furthermore, the discovery that genes linked to biosynthetic pathways are organized in clusters has opened new opportunities by adapting methodologies developed initially for microorganisms to plants like systematic cluster mining algorithms (Owen et al., 2017). Scossa et al. (2018) reviewed recently the progresses made in the understanding of plant biosynthetic pathways with the integration of metabolomics and next-generation sequencing based on various families of compounds: for example, benzoisoquinoline and monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, cannabinoids, ginsenosides, or withanolides. They also emphasized the new insight that this area can bring in the field of synthesis of NP. They mention for example, the intriguing case of caffeine biosynthesis that evolved independently in several orders of eudicots: at least three metabolic pathways evolved separately coopting genes from different gene families illustrating how biosynthetic pathways can evolve with land plant diversification (Scossa et al., 2018).",

It can be realized in a foreign host which enables the increase of product yields. The choice of this host organism is key as the goal is to develop an efficient platform for heterologous gene expression. Microbial hosts are generally considered more amenable than plants to fermentation process (Atanasov et al., 2015). Among them, classical work horses like E. coli or S. cerevisiae, or newcomers like Bacillus subtilis (Abdallah et al., 2019) and Pseudomonas putidaare (Nikel et al., 2014; Loeschcke and Thies, 2015; Choi and Lee, 2020) can be cited. Another interesting example is the recent high-cell-density fermentation strategies developed for heterologous production in Pichia pastoris (W.-C. Liu et al., 2019). Then, basically, the strategy will consist in cloning the genes of the enzymes of the pathway that have been identified; constructing large plasmid (or family of plasmids) encoding for those enzymes; transfecting with the plasmid a microorganism that will be grown afterwards; and purifying the product (Xiao et al., 2018). Several recent reviews detail how the technical advances in synthetic biology and multiplexed genome engineering allow for optimizing the design and synthesis of the pathways involved in NP production (Awan et al., 2016; Breitling and Takano, 2016; Carbonell et al., 2016; Smanski et al., 2016; Moses et al., 2017). Many such examples can be found such as for curcumin synthesis reconstitution in E. coli (Kang et al., 2018), polyunsaturated fatty acids production in the fungus Ashbya gossypii (Ledesma-Amaro et al., 2018), \u03b1-amyrin, lupulones ou ginsenosides synthesis in S. cerevisiae (Dai et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2019), or the diversification of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways (Umeno et al., 2005). But probably the best example of economically feasible process is reported for the production of artemisin at an industrial scale (Paddon and Keasling, 2014; Ikram and Simonsen, 2017).",

In this nonexhaustive set of publications, it was decided not to consider peptides and peptide-derived macrocycles (about a dozen structures). The next observation was that there were a surprising high number of bacteria-derived compounds, a feature that we did not notice in our previous surveys (\nTables 2\n\n\u2013\n\n4\n). Another parameter that allows for judging the feasibility and scalability of the processes is the yield and the number of steps. In that sense, most of those works are exquisitely delicate enterprises. The success of those publications in terms of tour de force is obvious, but they also allow for emphasizing the necessity to obtain such general synthetic routes, as most of those were used then to provide analogs to the desired NP in each publication.",

Another review summarized the way spiroacetal can be accessed, another common feature of many natural compounds (Zhang et al., 2018).

            "text": "As illustrated, plant natural chemical diversity is indeed immense. And the knowledge we gathered on plants is only the tip of the iceberg as exemplified in IA Ross\u2019s books (Ross, 1999; Ross, 2001), in which he gathered all the chemical components found in some 40 plants and their many different components. And this knowledge is certainly scattered all over the world. A unifying work should be done, under a simple format, that could be like the one presented in \nTable 3\n and completed by following the example of Solyomv\u00e1ry et al. (2017). This kind of tool would incredibly ease the access to plant natural chemical diversity and should ideally be comprehensive, organized and include data from worldwide plant species, from past to recent studies. Such a globalized database could furthermore be integrated to other ones like genomic, phylogenic, species occurrence, biosynthetic pathway, biological activity, or chemical classification (Allen et al., 2019) allowing researchers to mine the resources and correlate the information, hence empowering all kind of research studies. This trend has been emphasized by several authors in their recent reviews (Atanasov et al., 2015; Harvey et al., 2015) stating that drug discovery from plants requires multidisciplinary approaches. Experiences from the past tell us how important it is, for drug discovery purposes, to access this wide diversity lying in the Plant kingdom, especially because it may be shrinking due to the rapid alterations of the biosphere. In order to fully access the whole chemical diversity without jeopardizing plant biodiversity, alternative ways to collect and store plant tissues can be explored, as for example the use of in vitro culture techniques allowing a renewable and sustainable access to plant chemical diversity. As the final purpose is giving access to workable quantities of therapeutic compound(s), we suggested that the advances in synthetic biology coupled with genomics and bioinformatics can pave the way to possible future strategies of productions of the compounds originating from this diversity. But the chemical diversity in the scaffolds of plant natural compounds is so wide that there is still some space from different strategies for large-scale production: from organic total synthesis for the simpler scaffolds like ephedrine or metformin that are able to be synthetized in few steps, that is to say, at a reasonable cost or, at the other end of the spectrum, heterologous (plant)? production for compounds with more complex scaffolds like taxanes and multistep biosynthesis, and in between even hybrids (multihosts)? semisynthetic strategies can be imagined and developed.",
