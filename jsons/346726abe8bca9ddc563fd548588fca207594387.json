            "text": "Background: Internet analytics are increasingly being integrated into public health regulation. One specific application is to monitor compliance of website and social media activity with respect to jurisdictional regulations. These data may then identify breaches of compliance and inform disciplinary actions. Our study aimed to evaluate the novel use of internet analytics by a Canadian chiropractic regulator to determine their registrants compliance with three regulations related to specific health conditions, pregnancy conditions and most recently, claims of improved immunity during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: A customized internet search tool (Market Review Tool, MRT) was used by the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC), Canada to audit registrants websites and social media activity. The audits extracted words whose use within specific contexts is not permitted under CCBC guidelines. The MRT was first used in October of 2018 to identify words related to specific health conditions. The MRT was again used in December 2019 for words related to pregnancy and most recently in March 2020 for words related to COVID-19. In these three MRT applications, potential cases of word misuse were evaluated by the regulator who then notified the practitioner to comply with existing regulations by a specific date. The MRT was then used on that date to determine compliance. Those found to be non-compliant were referred to the regulator's inquiry committee. We mapped this process and reported the outcomes with permission of the regulator. Results: In September 2018, 250 inappropriate mentions of specific health conditions were detected from approximately 1250 registrants with 2 failing to comply. The second scan for pregnancy related terms of approximately1350 practitioners revealed 83 inappropriate mentions. Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe. Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word \"immune\" were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance.",

The software specifically searches for pre-defined words from a target list approved and maintained by the CCBC. Using this target list, searches performed by the MRT are made twice per month for websites, daily for social media and on demand as required. Following a search, the software returns cases where a word from the target list is identified. The CCBC then manually categorizes these cases into A) acceptable use of the target word (e.g. \"our office is closed during the COVID crisis\") and B) unacceptable use (e.g. \"chiropractic can boost immunity). For any case deemed unacceptable, the chiropractor(s) registered with the website or social media account is sent a notice to remediate the questionable material immediately (e.g. deletion of content). A MRT scan can then be performed multiple times to determine the rate at which compliance is achieved. When the stated deadline for mandatory compliance is reached, a follow up scan can then be performed and final compliance determined.

Although we did not receive data regarding the number of public complaints made to the CCBC during the time in which MRT has been in use, the CCBC communicated that there are occasions when a public concern is brought to their attention before the next scheduled MRT scan. These concerns are acted on immediately. Still, it is doubtful that this level of public surveillance can identify the number of potential cases of inappropriate word use compared to MRT scanning. While public input remains important to the regulatory process, a modern regulatory body whose registrants are increasingly engaged with the public on the internet should not rely exclusively on public input to monitor their registrants when internet analytics are now available. While both the public and internet surveillance components of a modern regulatory approach are important, neither can be effective without significant human effort. On the public side, effort is needed to not only identify and interpret incursions, but also to ensure they are reported to the regulator promptly. The public must be made aware by the regulator of what is appropriate and inappropriate to make safe health care decisions. Similarly, use of internet analytics by a regulator requires commitment to performing and analyzing scans regularly. Either way this information is obtained, the regulator must use its existing processes to the fullest to address potential concerns. This is important for protecting the public and to act as a deterrent for future incursions given a rapidly evolving health care environment where competition for patients is becoming substantially more intense. This is especially true for the chiropractic profession whose integration into mainstream healthcare is evolving but whose record of advertising practices in some jurisdictions is unsatisfactory [24, 25] .",
