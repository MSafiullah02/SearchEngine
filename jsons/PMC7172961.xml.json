            "text": "The Norovirus genus of the Caliciviridae has recently been shown to encompass viruses associated with diarrhea in cattle as well as the most frequently identified pathogens of adult human nonbacterial gastroenteritis Anon, 2000, Bridger et al., 1984, Dastjerdi et al., 1999, Fankhauser et al., 1998, Liu et al., 1999, Mead et al., 1999, Oliver et al., 2003, Reynolds et al., 1986, Smiley et al., 2003, van der Poel et al., 2000, Woode and Bridger, 1978. The noroviruses have positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes that range from 7.2 to 7.7 kb, which are organized into three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for the nonstructural proteins (ORF1), a capsid protein (ORF2) and the ORF3 protein Jiang et al., 1993, Lambden et al., 1993. Genomic analyses of the bovine enteric caliciviruses (BoCVs) showed that they formed a third norovirus genogroup distinct from genogroups I and II to which the human noroviruses belong Ando et al., 2000, Dastjerdi et al., 1999, Liu et al., 1999, Oliver et al., 2003. In contrast to the human genogroup I and II noroviruses (reviewed by Green et al., 2001), the extent of genomic and antigenic diversity among the BoCVs is not well characterized. The two human norovirus genogroups each contain at least seven genetic clusters Ando et al., 2000, Green et al., 2001. Ando et al. (2000) proposed two genetic clusters of BoCVs based on limited analysis of short regions of the capsid genes from two BoCVs. This suggestion was confirmed by Oliver et al. (2003) by phylogenetic analyses of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), capsid, and ORF3 genes of three additional viruses from the UK. The two clusters were represented by viruses similar to Bo/Newbury2/76/UK, identified in the UK in 1976, and a single virus from Germany, Bo/Jena/80/DE, identified in 1980. In addition to phylogenetic analyses, Oliver et al. (2003) identified differences between the two genogroup III clusters. The complete capsid (ORF2) proteins of four Newbury2-like viruses were predicted to be 522 amino acids long, 3 amino acids longer than the capsid protein of Bo/Jena/80/DE. The third ORF of the Newbury2-like viruses was predicted to be 282 amino acids long, 59 amino acids longer than Bo/Jena/80/DE, from an initiation codon 209 nucleotides upstream of the ORF2 termination codon. Other differences, such as insertions and deletions in the capsid and ORF3 genes and differences in the lengths of the 3\u2032 nontranslated regions, were also observed between the two genetic clusters.",

A few studies have used both the RdRp and the capsid genes, and on occasion, human noroviruses belonged to a different genetic cluster when the two regions were analyzed Hardy et al., 1997, Jiang et al., 1999a, Katayama et al., 2002, Vinje et al., 2000. This suggested the existence of chimeric genomes, but in two of these studies, the RdRp, capsid, and ORF3 sequences were not derived from a contiguous cDNA spanning the RdRp and capsid genes Hardy et al., 1997, Vinje et al., 2000.

To date, Jena-like viruses have not been identified in the UK and have been identified rarely elsewhere (Smiley et al., 2003). Short amplicons were generated, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), from the RdRp of viruses in bovine diarrheic fecal samples. These were prioritized for sequencing by identification of heterogeneity to Bo/Newbury2/76/UK using a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA). Such an approach has been used by the Health Protection Agency (formerly the Public Health Laboratory Service) in the UK to type human noroviruses (Mattick et al., 2000). Continuous cDNAs spanning the three ORFs, from the poly-A tail to the RdRp gene in ORF1, were generated and sequenced. We describe for the first time a chimeric genome, Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK, from a genogroup III BoCV.",

The clear separation of the heteroduplexes (Fig. 1\n, lanes D\u2013F, solid box) from the homoduplexes (Fig. 1, lanes A\u2013F, dotted box) showed that Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK was genomically diverse to the UK reference virus Bo/Newbury2/76/UK and the Bo/Aberystwyth65/00/UK virus in the RdRp (lanes E and F). Sequencing of the short sequence from the NI/E3 amplicon (76 nucleotides excluding the primer annealing regions) showed that Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK was most closely related in its RdRp to Bo/Jena/80/DE (84% nucleotide and 100% amino acid identity) than to Bo/Newbury2/76/UK (68% nucleotide and 96% amino acid identity). Of the 15 samples tested by HMA, the two BoCVs, Bo/Aberystwyth58/00/UK and Bo/Carmarthen10/99/UK, were also identified as diverse from Bo/Newbury2/76/UK. This was confirmed by sequence analysis as they were more closely related to Bo/Jena/80/DE (81% and 82% nucleotide, and, 100% amino acid identity) than to Bo/Newbury2/76/UK (75% and 76% nucleotide, and 96% amino acid identity). The three BoCVs (Bo/Aberystwyth58/00/UK, Bo/Carmarthen10/99/UK and Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK) had the same substitution in the 25 translated amino acids from an aspartic acid in the Bo/Newbury2/76/UK sequence (amino acid 87 in the partial ORF1) to an alanine as seen for the Bo/Jena/80/DE sequence (amino acid 1500 in the complete ORF1). Thus, Bo/Aberystwyth58/00/UK, Bo/Carmarthen10/99/UK, and Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK had a Jena-like RdRp showing that by polymerase type, both genetic clusters of genogroup III noroviruses were present in UK cattle.",

The nucleotide identity plot for 400 nucleotides towards the 5\u2032 end of the partial RdRp showed an average identity of approximately 70% between Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK and Bo/Newbury2/76/UK and approximately 90% between Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK and Bo/Jena/80/DE (Fig. 4)\n. Around the region where ORF1 and 2 overlap, between nucleotide positions 400 and 600, the identity of Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK and Bo/Newbury2/76/UK rose sharply to a peak of 90%, whereas nucleotide identity with Bo/Jena/80/DE dropped to 75%. This showed that the region between 400 and 600 nucleotides was where the putative recombination event had occurred in the Bo/Thirsk/10/UK genome. The point of recombination, predicted using LARD, occurred upstream of nucleotide 586 of the Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK 2818-nucleotide sequence.

In common with the present study, both these studies described sequences generated from single amplicons spanning the three ORFs. In the study with human genogroup II noroviruses (Jiang et al., 1999a), the RdRp gene of Hu/Mendoza320/95/ARG virus had 95% amino acid identity to the Hu/Lordsdale/93/UK virus (genetic cluster 4) but 87% identity to the Hu/Mexico/89/MX virus (genetic cluster 3). However, the amino acid identity of the Hu/Mendoza320/95/ARG capsid gene was more closely related to the Hu/Mexico/89/MX virus than to Hu/Lordsdale/93/UK (95% vs. 68% amino acid identity), indicating that recombination had occurred between the two genetic clusters. Katayama et al. (2002) confirmed genomic recombination between genogroup II noroviruses and also provided the first evidence for chimeric genomes in norovirus genogroup I. In both these studies with the three human noroviruses, the point of recombination was at the ORF1-2 overlap, the same region identified for the bovine genogroup III Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK virus. Additional studies support the existence of human noroviruses with chimeric genomes Hardy et al., 1997, Lochridge and Hardy, 2003, Vinje et al., 2000. However, in contrast to Jiang et al. (1999a), Katayama et al. (2002), and the present study, a contiguous cDNA of the polymerase and complete capsid genes was not used, but regions from the RdRp, capsid, and ORF3 genes were amplified independently. These could be generated from the genes of different viruses, rather than from a single virus, if a mixed population of viruses was present in the original fecal sample. Mixed populations have been described with human diarrhea samples (Gray et al., 1997). This led Vinje et al. (2000) to conclude that their data did not strictly show that noroviruses with chimeric genomes were identified. Hardy et al. (1997) predicted that further chimeric viruses would be identified and this has proved to be true.",

Two additional amplicons, Bo/Aberystwyth58/00/UK and Bo/Carmarthen10/99/UK, were identified as Jena-like in the present study. However, it was not possible to establish whether these viruses had chimeric genomes similar to Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK, as the generation of amplicons for the capsid gene and four attempts to generate cDNA that spanned the three ORFs for each virus was unsuccessful. With human noroviruses, two chimeric genomes were found in Japan out of 10 new genomes sequenced (Katayama et al., 2002). In Europe, two potentially chimeric genomes were found from 31 viruses (Vinje et al., 2000).

The majority of epidemiological studies of human noroviruses has been performed using RT-PCR with primers targeted at the RdRp Foley et al., 2001, Green et al., 1995a, Green et al., 1995b, Greening et al., 2001, Jiang et al., 1999b, Reuter et al., 2002, Vinje and Koopmans, 1996, but the existence of chimeric genomes shows that genetic clusters based on the RdRp gene do not necessarily correlate with the capsid gene. This observation was endorsed by recent surveillance data from the CDC, which showed that only 41% of human norovirus outbreaks typed using the capsid gene were associated with the same genetic cluster when the RdRp gene was used for typing (Anon, 2003). If chimeric BoCVs are not rare, diagnostic methods need to be used that take this into account. Vaccination is used to control calf diarrhea caused by bovine rotaviruses and coronaviruses (Crouch et al., 2001). It is possible that a calicivirus component might be incorporated into these vaccines. Thus, knowledge on the prevalence of the two capsid types in cattle populations is required so that vaccines with the appropriate strains can be produced. The results from the present study suggest it would be unwise to use a diagnostic test based solely on the BoCV RdRp gene.",

To tubes containing sample buffer (4-\u03bcl nuclease-free H2O, 2-\u03bcl 6\u00d7 loading buffer, Promega, and 1-\u03bcl formamide, Promega), 5 \u03bcl of amplicon from Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK was mixed with the Bo/Aberystwyth65/00/UK or Bo/Newbury2/76/UK amplicon to generate heteroduplexes. Samples were denatured for 3 min at 98 \u00b0C using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin\u2013Elmer), placed immediately on ice for 10 min, then loaded on to 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5% polyethylene glycol 6000 (BDH), with 2.5 M urea (Sigma), prepared in a BioRad Protean II apparatus. Gels were run at 300 V until the xylene cyanol band was 1 cm from the bottom of the gel then stained with GelStar stain (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications). Heteroduplexes were identified by their slower migration in the gel compared to the homoduplexes generated by running the Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK, Bo/Aberystwyth65/00/UK, or Bo/Newbury2/76/UK amplicons in separate lanes after denaturation. Sequencing of the 316 bp amplicons showed that the location of the 5\u2032 end of the E3 primer was 98 nucleotides from the M13-forward sequence and that heteroduplexes were not a consequence of the orientation of NI/E3 amplicons in the pCR2.1-TOPO vector.",
