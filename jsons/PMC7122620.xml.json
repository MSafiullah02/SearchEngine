The prostate cancer is considered as the fifth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in men, with a global prevalence of about 7.9 percent [3, 4]. The risk factors for cancers related to reproductive system include but not limited to endogenous factors such as genetic history, race, aging, hormonal imbalance, and exogenous factors such as inappropriate diet, unhealthy lifestyle, and environmental and occupational factors. Moreover, cervical cancer risk factors are extended to the infection of human papilloma virus (HPV), extended usage of contraceptives, age of menarche and menopause, unsafe sexual activities such as sexual intercourse at an early stage and multiple sexual partners [1, 5\u201312]. This chapter provides a detailed overview of the structural, pharmaceutical, and clinical aspects of the agents discovered to target the dominant receptors involved in the development, treatment, and prognosis of the reproductive neoplasia.",

They exert their functions through the action of steroid hormone receptors, namely, the estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and androgen (AR) receptors, respectively. Aberrations in their expression and/or in the factors regulating them, termed as coregulators, lead to either activation or suppression of their transcription machinery, eventually impacting their physiological functions.

The PRs were found to exhibit tumor-suppressive properties in cervical cancer [1, 7]. In the case of ovarian malignancy, ER\u03b1 expression provided a better prognosis, while the role of ER\u03b2 was insignificant. On the other hand, an elevated PR expression was observed to improve the survival rate in patients with endometrial ovarian cancer (EOC) [80]. The activity of AR has been closely linked to the prostatic carcinogenesis. The biochemical pathway of AR, the principal regulator of prostatic cancer, is perturbed during the carcinogenesis. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an advanced stage of the disease which is nonresponsive to hormone deprivation therapy, occurs due to increase in sensitivity of the AR to the agonists, mutations in the receptor, ligand-independent activation of the ARs, etc. [71]",

The GnRHR is also expressed in the CRPC [82]. Primary cultures of ovarian carcinomas and biopsy specimens of malignant ovarian tissue have revealed the predominant expression of the GnRHR receptor (>80%), signifying its role in the genesis of malignancy and metastasis. The GnRHR has also been speculated to be associated with the early phases of ovarian carcinogenesis, including cell migration and invasion [83]. It was observed that administration of GnRH-1 agonists and antagonists lead to the downregulation and inactivation of GnRHR, respectively. As a result, the GnRH agonists cause inhibition of cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Moreover, the GnRH antagonists also possess antineoplastic activity [81, 82]. Thus, exploration of the structure and regulation of the GnRHRs in cancers of the reproductive system may enhance their applicability, as a target receptor, for the discovery of new-age anticancer therapeutics.",

            "text": "Unbound AR exists in an inactive state in the cytoplasm, in complexation with the heat shock proteins (HSP) such as HSP90. Upon binding to a ligand/agonist, it gets activated and dissociates from the HSP and undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation. Binding of an agonist leads to the formation of the AF-2 region on the surface of LBD. Upon ligand binding, AF-2 interacts with the amino-terminal motifs of the receptor, which leads to an establishment of N/C intradomain crosstalk, thereby leading to receptor stabilization, enhanced DNA-binding affinity, and reduced ligand dissociation, a phenomenon exclusively observed in the AR, unlike other steroid receptors. AF-2 domain also recruits coregulatory proteins to an activated AR, thereby contributing to its overall function. H12, the core structure of AF-2, acts as a lid to close LBP, upon binding of the agonist. Further, the NLS gets exposed upon the ligand/agonist binding and interacts with importin-\u03b1. This leads to translocation of AR from cytoplasm to the nucleus. DBD facilitates interaction of the translocated receptor with the DNA at specific recognition sites. These sites, located in the promoter and enhancer regions of the AR target genes, consist of consensus sequences and are termed as androgen response elements (ARE). Access of AR to the target chromatin requires concerted action of certain transcription factors. AF-1 and AF-5 of NTD mediate the transcriptional activity by recruitment of coactivator complexes and transcription machinery, essential to regulate the expression of the target genes. Selective recognition of specific ARE sequences is regulated by the ligand-binding and/or presence of other transcription factors [84, 89\u201391]. Figure 4.1a provides a schematic layout of the structure of the steroid receptor (SR) and its pathway of transactivation after binding of the ligand.",

Carbon atoms of the testosterone skeleton have been numbered in order to provide basis for the SARs with various ligands and their derivatives [71]. Synthetic derivatives of testosterone have been prepared to enhance oral bioavailability. It is essential for the ligand (natural/synthetic) to contain a steroidal skeleton for retaining the androgenic activity.

The ER receptor consists of an NTD, DBD, hinge region, and LBD. The NTD stimulates transcription from particular estrogen-responsive promoters via AF-1. DBD binds to estrogen response elements (ERE) in the target DNA, while the hinge region contains nuclear NLS. The LBD and AF-2 activate the gene expression in response to ligand binding. The classical genomic pathway results in the formation of estrogen-dependent, nuclear ER homo- or heterodimers, such as ER-\u03b1/ER-\u03b1, ER-\u03b2/ER-\u03b2, and ER-\u03b1/ER-\u03b2, respectively. Further, these dimers subsequently bind to the estrogen response element (ERE) sequences located in the promoter region of estrogen-responsive genes, resulting in the recruitment of coregulatory proteins (coactivators or corepressors) to the promoter. This leads to either an enhancement or reduction in the mRNA levels, further impacting the production of associated proteins and eventually the physiological response [89, 96].",

The NTD is responsible for ligand-independent transcriptional activation and harbors a highly variable AF-1 domain. The DBD binds to the progesterone response elements (PREs) located in the target DNA. The hinge region contains NLS, while the LBD and a highly conserved AF-2 domain are responsible for the ligand-mediated transactivation of the gene expression, via the genomic pathway. The LBD or the primary recognition domain comprises a hydrophobic LBP, to facilitate ligand binding. The genomic pathway operates on binding of P4, which causes conformational change in the PR, thereby transforming it into an active transcriptional factor. As a result, receptor phosphorylation occurs and the PR undergoes dimerization (homo/hetero) and nuclear translocation, to further interact with the PREs. This also leads to the recruitment of coactivators that mediate gene transcription. It has been reported that PR-A and PR-B possess opposite transcriptional activities and the overall response of P4 is dependent on the relative in vivo levels of PR-A and PR-B. 5\u03b1-reductase and 20\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are responsible for the metabolic conversion of P4 to a more active or less active form, before interaction with the receptors in the target cells [89, 102, 106].",

The ligands of the receptor interact with the variable, extracellular half of the receptor molecule. The membrane-spanning receptor domain transmits the signal generated upon ligand binding to the cytosolic receptor surface, which further interacts with the G protein. The GnRHR must exist in a silent state that does not activate the G protein, in order to transduce the signals mediated by agonists across the cell membrane. Binding of the agonist causes transition from the silent state and leads to the binding and activation of G proteins, situated on the opposite side of the cell membrane. Thus, agonists like GnRH act as allosteric activators of the receptor. The primary features of the inactive form of the receptor include closed G-protein-binding pocket, a hydrogen-bonding network, and a hydrophobic barrier. Binding of the ligand activates the receptor, causing rotation and change in the interfaces of specific TM segments, leading to opening of the hydrophobic barrier, movement of specific amino acid residues toward the interior of the TM bundle, and ultimately opening of the cytoplasmic surface cleft that allows contact and binding of the G-proteins [108]. The structure of the recognition domain or LBD of the receptor, involved in binding, depends on the type of the ligand such as a neurotransmitter, a glycoprotein hormone, and a peptide. In the case of a neurotransmitter, the TM domains (TMDs) themselves form the LBP to facilitate ligand binding. The amino-terminal domain of the receptor, encompassing the high-affinity ligand-binding site, has been reported to be recognition domain for glycoprotein hormones. A high-affinity binding site for the peptide-based ligands include both extracellular and TM residues [109].",

Investigations have been carried out for targeting advanced mCRPC by prodrug approach by means of targeting prostate cancer-specific antigens such as prostate-specific antigens (PSA), prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA), CD147, heat shock proteins (HSPs), leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor, epithelial cell adhesion molecules, etc., and prostate-specific enzymes such as cathepsin or matrix metalloproteinase. Numerous PSMA-targeting molecules, which include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), antibody fragments (Fabs), peptides, and aptamers, have been developed in the form of prodrugs or nanoparticles. In recent times, a prodrug, namely vinblastine-N-oxide (CPD100), was developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer by Cascade Prodrug, a US-based pharmaceutical company. This compound, formulated as sphingomyelin-cholesterol liposomes, is converted into its parent compound, vinblastine, under hypoxic conditions. This formulation was found to be highly successful in the preliminary studies and if successful in clinical trials, it will be the first-of-its-kind of chemotherapeutic agent to demonstrate anticancer activity due to the hypoxic microenvironment present in the solid tumors [126\u2013128].",

The AIs blocks the protein involved in estrogen synthesis, but their usage is limited for the postmenopausal women, as they do not inhibit estrogen synthesis in the ovaries of the premenopausal women. Fulvestrant (Faslodex\u00ae), Anastrozole (Arimidex\u00ae), Letrozole (Femara\u00ae), and Exemestane (Aromasin\u00ae) are examples of the AIs, which are useful either as a monotherapy or combinatorial therapy, during the treatment of ovarian cancer [121, 129\u2013131].",

Recently, an innovative effort provided a strong confirmation that enhanced estrogen signaling is responsible for the growth of the cervical tumor. Enhanced expression of Cyclin D1, ERs, and aromatase is significantly associated with the tumor growth. Hence, blocking the estrogen pathway, particularly to decrease the ER activity, can be a rational approach to activate p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), along with lowering the expression of HPV E6 and E7. This approach has been utilized to block ER-mediated tumor growth in cervical cancer cells, by transfection using adenovirus (AD) as a gene carrier [132].",

Moreover, strategies and molecules developed for targeting these receptors, for formulating clinically relevant anticancer therapeutics, have been put forth and supported by the ongoing preclinical and clinical studies. We speculate that a combinatorial therapy comprising receptor-targeted ligands/agents, with clinically acceptable cytotoxic drugs, as well as targeting moieties such as antibodies ( antibody\u2013drug conjugates) and use of nano- and novel carriers for drug delivery, will enhance the overall antineoplastic effect. Considerable research has been conducted in deciphering the role of the AR and GnRHR in the cancers of the reproductive system and efforts to target these receptors have been commenced. We anticipate similar investigations to be conducted for ER and PR receptors in the near future.",

Binding of the ligand causes activation of the HSP-90-bound SR that undergoes nuclear translocation, dimerization, and then binds to the hormone response elements (HRE) by the action of cofactors/coactivators, thus resulting into transactivation and transcription of the target genes. The enlarged view of the SR reveals different structural domains, namely, N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA-binding domain (DBD), Hinge region (H), and ligand-binding domain (LBD), wherein each domain is capped by N-termini and C-termini amino acid residues. Presence of NLS, AF-1, and AF-2 domains has also been indicated. (b) Schematic representation of GnRHR and intracellular pathway activated on binding of GnRH. Binding of the ligand activates the receptor. The latter binds to GTP-linked proteins, or G-proteins. G\u03b1q/11, a subunit of G-proteins, activates phospholipase C, which then hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
