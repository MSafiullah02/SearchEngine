            "text": "Purpose: Current direct-acting antiviral agents for treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 4a (HCV-4a) have been reported to cause adverse effects, and therefore less toxic antivirals are needed. This study investigated the role of curcumin chitosan (CuCs) nanocomposite as a potential anti-HCV-4a agent in human hepatoma cells Huh7. Methods: Docking of curcumin and CuCs nanocomposite and binding energy calculations were carried out. Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and CuCs nanocomposite were prepared with an ionic gelation method and characterized with TEM, zeta size and potential, and HPLC to calculate encapsulation efficiency. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on Huh7 cells using MTT assay and confirmed with cellular and molecular assays. Anti-HCV-4a activity was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot. Results: The strength of binding interactions between protein ligand complexes gave scores with NS3 protease, NS5A polymerase, and NS5B polymerase of -124.91, -159.02, and -129.16, for curcumin respectively, and -68.51, -54.52, and -157.63 for CuCs nanocomposite, respectively. CuCs nanocomposite was prepared at sizes 29-39.5 nm and charges of 33 mV. HPLC detected 4% of curcumin encapsulated into CsNPs. IC50 was 8 \u00b5g/mL for curcumin and 25 \u00b5g/ mL for the nanocomposite on Huh7 but was 25.8 \u00b5g/mL and 34 \u00b5g/mL on WISH cells. CsNPs had no cytotoxic effect on tested cell lines. Apoptotic genes' expression revealed the caspasedependent pathway mechanism. CsNPs and CuCs nanocomposite demonstrated 100% inhibition of viral entry and replication, which was confirmed with HCV core protein expression. Conclusion: CuCs nanocomposite inhibited HCV-4a entry and replication compared to curcumin alone, suggesting its potential role as an effective therapeutic agent.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus genotype 4a (HCV-4a) is a major public health problem, especially among the Egyptian population. There are more than 70 million individuals infected worldwide. It is the leading cause of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Newly emerged anti-HCV viral agents have recently become available on the market but with serious complications, high cost, and possible development of resistance. This has encouraged scientists to search for alternative, safer antiviral approaches. Nanoparticles offer unique physical properties that have associated benefits for antimicrobial activity or as drug carrier that can improve antiviral therapy. The significance of our research is in establishment of a natural nanoparticle drug carrier system that we screened with computer simulation studies and in cells against HCV-4a replication into human hepatoblastoma cell",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently infects over 71 million individuals around the world. Its persistence causes infected individuals to enter a chronic phase that then leads to several different outcomes of liver disease. 1 HCV therapies are becoming highly efficient and well tolerated due to improved understanding of HCV biology and to the discovery of antiviral targeting of essential viral functions. 1, 2 The NS5B polymerase, NS5A and NS3 proteases are considered crucial targets for the development of direct-acting antiviral drugs. 3 The current treatment of HCV genotype 4a (HCV-4a) includes sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and ombitasvir. The response rate has reached more than 90%. 4 Despite the promise of such therapy, the suboptimal efficacy and adverse effects like anemia, rash, bilirubin, nausea, pruritus, and photosensitivity 5 as well as the increasing number of patients with advanced liver disease and no therapeutic options emphasize a major need for improved therapeutic regimens. In addition, the high mutation rate of viral RNA and development of mutant resistant strains has slowed development of innovative anti-HCV drugs. Therefore, natural compounds extracted from plants have attracted the attention of researchers for their therapeutic activities. 6 A substantial variety of natural compounds has demonstrated antiviral activity, including against HCV, 7 or hepatoprotective effect from natural compounds like naringenin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), silymarin, and caffeine. 8, 9 Turmeric curcumin, known as curcuma longa, is a natural plant with a significant therapeutic role that harbors no side effects. 10 Curcumin's activity as an antiviral emerged recently, and it exhibits a significantly high inhibition against several viruses, like hepatitis B virus, 11 HIV, influenza viruses, and human herpes viruses. 12 Several reports demonstrated curcumin's activity against HCV; it can obstruct viral attachment and fusion to hepatocytes and prevent cell to cell transmission due to loss of the membrane's integrity. 10, 13 However, curcumin's positive effect is hampered by its lower solubility, bioavailability, and low cellular uptake, but the progress in nanotechnology has enabled formulation of nanoparticles, and polymeric nanoparticles can be used to encapsulate curcumin. This could resolve curcumin's limitations by enhancing its sustained release to target diseased cells, improve its bioavailability, prevent it from degradation or metabolism, and increase its therapeutic potential. 14 Polymeric nanoparticles are biocompatible and biodegradable and have been developed as drug delivery vectors and have desirable properties like better encapsulation of compounds to protect and deliver them efficiently with high pharmacokinetics and endocytosis efficiency. 15 Chitosan is derived from chitin, which is a natural biopolymer and is the second most abundant natural polysaccharide. 16 It is found primarily in marine animals' exoskeleton, ie, lobsters, shrimps and crabs. Chitosan is immunogenic, and its antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antimicrobial activities have been observed.- 17, 18 It has been reported that preparation of chitosan as nanoparticles revealed no toxicity at lower concentration (30 \u00b5g/ mL) but showed anticancer activity at higher concentrations (>100 \u00b5g/mL) against different cancer cell lines, which supports its application as a drug delivery system. 17, 19 Previously, chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) have been conjugated with antiretroviral agents like saquinavir, a protease inhibitor, to improve anti-HIV therapy; cell targeting efficiency increased by 92% compared to the soluble drug control. 20 Accordingly, to increase the antiviral activity of curcumin, in the present study we conjugated chitosan and curcumin as a nanocomposite and evaluated it for antiviral activity against entry and replication of HCV-4 in hepatoblastoma cells and performed in silico studies.

The FTIR spectra of chitosan, curcumin, and CuCs nanocomposite are shown in Figure 2C . Characteristic bands at 1511 cm \u22121 and 1062 cm \u22121 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of the C=C vibrations, and C-O-C stretching modes, respectively, in curcumin. For CsNPs, the characteristic band at 3450 cm \u22121 was assigned to stretching vibration mode of N-H overlapped with O-H stretching vibration mode, the band at 2880 cm \u22121 was due to C-H stretching vibration mode, the band at 1653 cm \u22121 was assigned to the C=O, and the band at 1428 cm \u22121 was assigned to bending vibration of N-H stretching vibration. In comparison with curcumin, a different spectrum was observed for CuCs nanocomposite as new bands appeared at 1070 cm \u22121 and the N-H group of CsNPs disappeared ( Table 2 ). It can be assumed that the ammonium groups of chitosan were linked with OH groups of curcumin to form the nanocomposite.

Therefore, discovery of more effective and less toxic antiviral agents is still needed. Computational screening of large chemical libraries using molecular docking and the establishment of HCV culture model has led to numerous studies and the discovery of many anti-HCV agents. Accordingly, we started working on CsNPs, 19 and the in silico results demonstrated high binding affinity towards HCV-4a target proteins (NS3 protease, NS5B polymerase, and NS5A helicase) and this encouraged us to continue our research on CsNPs as a drug delivery system for antiviral agents, hoping to increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease therapeutic dose. In the current research, curcumin was encapsulated into CsNPs and evaluated for its antiviral activity against HCV-4a first with in silico analysis and subsequently with in vitro studies, with the hope to discover new candidates for use as HCV-4a inhibitors. Our in silico analysis gave promising results by showing an increase in the affinity of our designed nanocomposite against HCV-4a NS5B compared to curcumin alone, suggesting its potential role against viral replication, first with in silico analysis and subsequently with in vitro studies, to discover new candidates for use as HCV-4a inhibitors.

In addition, its physicochemical properties are unstable in several conditions like neutral pH or alkaline pH \u22657.0, and ambient temperature. 36 Therefore, we conjugated curcumin into CsNPs to improve its properties, control its release, and enhance its antiviral activity. Our preparation was performed at acidic pH with certain modifications, 26 using ascorbic acid as solvent for CsNPs instead of acetic acid, where positive charges of amino groups on chitosan can interact with negative charges on OH of curcumin through electrostatic interactions, leading to formation of CuCs nanocomposite. This binding property was found to be much less at neutral or alkaline pH due to the higher tendency of CsNPs to aggregate because of neutralization of the amino groups on CsNPs. 17 Our HPLC experiment demonstrated 4% entrapment of curcumin into CsNPs after 6 minutes of polymeric digestion; this time needs to be lengthened in the future preparations. Drug release profile showed that 50% of loaded curcumin was released during the first 11 minutes-the release time known as \"burst release\" meaning the amount of curcumin deposited on the outer surface of the CsNPs-and 34% of curcumin was released at 120 minutes. This means that the total release of curcumin (84%) was obtained after 2 hours. Afterward, a relatively constant release of curcumin was observed for the next 4 hours (ie 240 minutes). This is supported by results of Akhtar et al who reported pharmacokinetic analysis for chitosan bound to curcumin in parasite Plasmodium yoelii infected mice. 17 They found that the curcumin concentration detected in the blood was significantly higher in mice fed with curcumin loaded onto CsNPs compared to blood from mice administered an equimolar concentration of curcumin alone. Results showed that administration of CsNPs orally ensured a sustained release of curcumin over 8 hours post-feeding, whereas, in the case of curcumin alone, the levels declined significantly after 3 hours and were not detectable beyond 6 hours. In a study by Samrot et al, curcumin-loaded CsNPs were synthesized from crab shell for drug delivery using two chelators (TPP and BaCl 2 ) in preparation of CsNPs. 37 They observed an initial drug burst from the biopolymer that then become steady, and the CsNPs chelated with BaCl 2 led to sustained drug release for more than 70 minutes. Regarding CsNPs chelated with TPP, the samples had a stable drug release profile; drug release increased from the 20 th to the 60 th minute and then gradually decreased until the 100th minute, followed by a stable release. This indicates that chitosan synthesized using TPP showed a slow release of curcumin for 180 minutes.",

            "text": "Such an observation might explain why the cytotoxic effect of our synthesized nanocomposite was lower than that of curcumin alone (25 \u00b5g/mL versus 8 \u00b5g/mL for curcumin). The literature shows that the cytotoxic effect of a nanoformulation of curcumin is equal to or higher than that of free curcumin. 38, 39 This does not match our results where the cytotoxic effect of CuCs was lower than that of free curcumin. This might be due to i) the lower % of the entrapment efficiency, ii) the nature of the nanocarrier, which is different in the current study than in previous studies, and iii) the antioxidant properties of CsNPs as previously reported by Nair et al. 40 Further extensive investigations using simulated CompuSyn software (Linear Interaction Effect) were conducted to investigate possible additivity between curcumin and CsNPs, which might predict the synergistic effect of CuCs nanocomposite as antiviral activity. Upon using multiple inhibitors of different types and mechanisms of inhibition on enzyme kinetic models, several hundred equations have been derived that can be reduced to general equation by comparing theoretical biological activities in the absence and presence of inhibitors. This mathematical work leads to the CI. The obtained data are unique to each laboratory because data vary according to instrument, reagents, and type of cells grown in each lab. 41 The nature of cell death induced by the formulated CuCs nanocomposite was analyzed with flow cytometry, and results showed that Huh7 treated with an IC50 concentration of nanocomposite induced cell cycle arrest at the preG1 phase in comparison to the untreated cells, which hindered their entrance into the S and G2/M phases. This might be due to the small amount of DNA content and admission into programmed cell death, as previously illustrated by Kumar et al. 42 The results of molecular apoptotic gene expression level of cells treated with an IC50 concentration of curcumin and its composite showed high expression levels in caspase 3 and lowered expression of Bcl2 in Huh7 cells treated with curcumin and its nanocomposite. This indicates that the apoptosis was induced via a caspasedependent pathway. Such cytotoxic effect could be due to the production of reactive oxygen species in response to the toxic dose of curcumin, resulting in DNA breakage, which in turn causes activation of p53 that can recruit other molecules like Bax, Bak. This, in turn, causes pores in the mitochondria membrane, disrupting its membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c, which stimulates a cascade of death compounds and ultimately cell death. 43 Finally, protein expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 8, p53, and Bcl2 were detected using ELISA assay. Cells treated with paclitaxel, a standard anticancer drug served as a control. Our results matched that of mRNA transcriptional level, which showed an increase in the expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 8, and p53 proteins and a decrease in the expression levels of Bcl2 protein compared to untreated Huh7. These results confirmed the designated roles of the nanocomposite in mediation in the apoptotic process through cell death receptors and induction of apoptosis through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. 44, 45 Concerning assessment of the antiviral activity of CsNPs, curcumin, and its nanocomposite, curcumin demonstrated inhibition of HCV-4a entry by 94.5%, which is in line with results reported by Kusuma et al, 46 where curcumin was confirmed to block the HCV entry pathway into its targeted hepatoma cells with no effect on viral assembly or virion release. Moreover, our data match those of Anggakusuma et al who reported that curcumin nanoformulation increased its antiviral activity with no toxic effect; they demonstrated that the antiviral mechanism occurred by affecting virion membrane fluidity without disrupting virion integrity. 10 In the present study, the same observations were obtained upon analyzing antiviral activity against replication of HCV-4a; these results confirm the in silico analysis and demonstrate the dual roles of CsNPs and its composite to inhibit both viral entry and replication. These results were confirmed with HCV core protein expression using Western blot assay, which demonstrated a remarkable decrease in the expression level after the treatment of cells with CsNPs, curcumin, and nanocomposite. Nevertheless, the nanocomposite exhibited the lowest decrease in the HCV core protein expression, which indicates that the nanocomposite has the highest antiviral activity whether against viral entry or replication. Further investigations are still required to study the anti-HCV activity of nanocomposite in the replicating system, which is underway in our laboratory.",
