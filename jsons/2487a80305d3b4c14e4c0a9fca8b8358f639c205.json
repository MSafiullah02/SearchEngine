In this circumstance, patients with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, active cancer, diabetes, stroke, dementia, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and so on, would suffer from emotional disturbance, anxiety, anger, confusion, and stigma as summarized by Brooks et al. (2020) because of sudden separation from loved ones, shortage of living supplies, the loss of freedom, and uncertainty over disease status. In addition, some patients have been confronted with difficulties in routine medical treatments due to delayed transportation and shortages of medicines and human resources in hospitals (Pellino and Spinelli, 2020) . What's more, in this epidemic the mortality rate in elderly patients with chronic diseases is the highest. The data from China and Italy showed that the presence of these comorbidities might have increased the risk of mortality independent of COVID-19 infection (Graziano et al., 2020) . So some old patients with chronic diseases dare not go to hospital. All these situations increase the possibility of relapse or even death.",

In this context, psychiatrists can play pivotal role in supporting the well-being of those affected and their families, the at-risk healthcare staff as well as the public (Banerjee, 2020) , including the patients with chronic severe diseases. Therefore it is necessary and urgent to address the comprehensive physical and psychological intervention for the vulnerable population during the epidemic.",
