            "text": "Transverse myelitis (TM) is a focal inflammation across the spinal cord along one or more levels, in the absence of a compressive lesion. This inflammation can cause damage to the ensheathing nerve cell fiber myelin, with resultant neurological dysfunction including weakness, sensory impairments, and autonomic problems including the bowel and bladder.1, 2, 3 The diagnosis may incorporate the terms idiopathic, where no specific bacterial, viral, or other obvious inflammatory cause can be found, or secondary, where there is an antecedent or associated disease. Other commonly encountered descriptors include acute, acute partial, acute complete, and longitudinally extensive. There are few population-based studies available, and comparative or meta-analysis of the literature is difficult because of the various presentations of TM being reported. It appears, however, that acute TM is rare, with only 1400 new cases annually in the United States, or 1.34 to 4.6 cases per million population per year.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 With availability of improved diagnostic tools, unveiling of the disease over time and longer follow-up periods, the etiology often becomes clearer, including those originally labeled as idiopathic. An older study from 1993 in the United States on acute or subacute noncompressive myelopathy reported that 45% of the cases were parainfectious, 21% multiple sclerosis, 12% spinal cord ischemia, and 21% idiopathic.4 A 2005 French multicenter retrospective study applying the TM Consortium Working Group criteria1 for acute TM to 288 subjects had a more even spread. Systemic disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome) was implicated in 20.5%, spinal cord infarct in 18.8%, multiple sclerosis 10.8%, infectious or parainfectious 17.3%, neuromyelitis optica 17%, and idiopathic acute TM 15.6%.6 Another study from France in 2012 on acute partial TM with median follow-up period of 104.8 months reported etiology of the cases as being 62% multiple sclerosis, 1% postinfectious myelitis, 1% neuromyelitis optica, 1% Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, and 34% undetermined or idiopathic.7\n",

C6 innervation allows independence with upper extremity dressing, bathing with equipment, and functional propulsion of a manual wheelchair indoors. The patient with superior balance and motor control could theoretically perform independent or supervised transfers with a sliding board, and self-catheterize with appropriate assistive devices. Driving a specially adapted automatic transmission vehicle with powered steering, hand-controlled accelerator and brake can be achieved with C7-C8 preservation. A C7 level allows independence in all self-care activities with equipment, independent transfers with ability to push off using intact elbow extensor muscles, and the patient may be able to live alone. A patient with C8 and T1 innervation will have improved manual strength and dexterity for self-care, is independent with a manual wheelchair, and should be able to self-catheterize. Preservation of upper thoracic innervation allows a greater degree of trunk control, increasing stability during use and propulsion of a manual wheelchair. It also adds to ease and independence with bladder and bowel self-management. With bracing of the hips, knees, and ankles (KAFO or knee-ankle-foot orthoses), minimal ambulation can be attempted, although mainly for training and exercise purposes than truly functional. Independent ambulation, even with bracing and bilateral axillary or forearm crutches, is usually not realistic unless the patient has preservation of some upper lumbar innervation. Further preservation of lumbar and sacral innervation will increase ease of ambulation with better trunk and pelvic control. The patient with incomplete spinal injury is less predictable, and functional abilities will largely depend on the degree and nature of neurologic preservation.",

All muscles and joints should be kept as active as possible, and daily exercises to preserve range of motion of the joints will help prevent contractures and keep joints flexible. Progressive resistive exercises and possibly functional electrical stimulation (FES), also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, help maintain strength and decrease muscle atrophy.31 Exercises for inspiratory muscles should be included and use of an incentive spirometer as needed. Rarely, glossopharyngeal breathing may need to be taught and electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve diaphragm considered in the high cervical cord patient not showing recovery.32 Spasticity (see Chapter 154) is a possible complication and regular stretching with use of antispasticity medications such as baclofen, diazepam, gabapentin, and tizanidine, can minimize and decrease development of joint contractures. If pain is present, appropriate medications, thermal (heat, cold), and electrical modalities including transcutaneous electrical stimulation may be helpful. Antiepileptic drugs such as gabapentin, pregabalin, and carbamazepine, may be prescribed as they have good efficacy for neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline may also be useful, although caution is advised with its strong anticholinergic effects. Thorough checks of the skin on a daily basis can help avoid pressure sores and associated infections. Insensate areas, particularly over bony prominences, should be relieved with special cushions and mattresses such as egg-crate foam and alternating pressure overlays, and pressure-relieving ankle-foot orthoses (PRAFO) may be helpful. The many varieties of hydrophilic and antimicrobial wound dressings currently available promote faster healing of skin breakdown.",

            "text": "Overuse syndromes often occur because muscles and joints are overstressed during functional compensation for weakness or even during the process of rehabilitation training. Shoulder pain is a common phenomenon with causes including tendinitis, rotator cuff injury, impingement syndromes, contractures, and inflammatory or degenerative arthritis. Steroid and local anesthetic injections in the joint may sometimes be needed, but topical anti-inflammatory drugs, heat, cold, and other modalities, with proper transfer techniques or specific adaptive equipment such as sliding board, are often helpful. A common complication is ischemic breakdown of the skin if pressure relief is not regularly performed. Awareness and monitoring for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism should be routine. Prolonged pressure on a peripheral nerve can also cause dysesthesias, pain, or weakness. There may be sexuality, reproduction, and fertility concerns, particularly in younger as well as sexually active patients. The concerns and possible solutions should be discussed, addressed, or referred to a specialist as appropriate.",

Strictures or tracheal irritation can result from tracheostomy tubes, lung infections are common in this population, and the ventilators may break down, resulting in an emergency situation. High-dose corticosteroids frequently used for treatment of inflammation in the spinal cord may result in peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Thromboembolism prophylaxis and anticoagulant treatment in the event of this happening may result in serious bleeding complications. Skin breakdown may result at contact and pressure areas with devices or dressings used. Frequent catheterization results in increased risk for urinary tract infections and accidental creation of false passages in the urethra with development of strictures. If bowel programs are not well managed or carried out gently, there may be discomfort, pain, and anorectal injuries.",
