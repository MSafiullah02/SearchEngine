Its causative agent is transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), considered the principal etiologic agent responsible for dramatic outbreaks of diarrhea and high mortality of newborn pigs, in which mortality approaches 100% [1] [2] . Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is believed to be a mutant of TGEV, as it has been shown to be genetically related to TGEV but has a selective tropism for respiratory tissue with very little to no replication in the intestinal tissue of infected swine [3] . TGEV and PRCV share high homology in genome and can generate the full cross-reaction neutralizing antibody [4] [5] [6] , so it is difficult to discriminate TGE in clinical diagnosis with traditional serological methods.",

            "text": "The spike protein of TGEV has been shown to contain four major antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D). Site A is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been previously subdivided into the three subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac. Site A contains the residues 538, 591, and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac, respectively. The peptide 537-MKSGYGQPIA-547 represents, at least partially, subsite Ac which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. This site is relevant for diagnosis and could be of interest for protection. Other residues contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51), and site D (residue 385). Site C can be represented by the peptide 48-P-P/S-N-S-D/E-52 but is not exposed on the surface of native virus [8] . Site B is dependent on intracellular glycosylation and is complex and conformation-dependent. This site is formed by at least three epitopes. Although site B is conformation dependent, MAbs specific for this site can bind TGEV spike protein by immunoblotting providing that the samples were not treated with 2-mercaptoethanol. Most probably, renaturation of spike protein occurs during the blotting of the protein to nitrocellulose paper [8] . Site C is linear and continuous. It is recognized by MAbs in Western blot analysis after treatment of the virus with 2.5% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol; It is represented by synthetic nonapeptides derived from TGEV spike protein [9] ; It is present in recombinant products expressed in bacteria, which do not reconstitute the native spike protein [10] ; and it is formed in the absence of glycosylation [8] . In addition, because binding and sequencing studies indicate that site C is not present in the respiratory variants of TGEV, this peptide could be useful to discriminate serum from TGEV or PRCV infected animals. The purified recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic system in this research, can be recognized specially by polyclonal antibody according to the research of Yang et al [10] .",
