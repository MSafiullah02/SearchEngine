Also, unlike PCR, Q\u03b2 replicase displays strict amplification selectivity. Only the so-called replicable RNAs are amplified: the genomic RNA of Q\u03b2 phage and short-chained RQ RNAs, a special class of RNAs that are rarely generated in vivo or in vitro by virtue of sequence recombination and point mutations3, cellular RNAs and even the genomic RNAs of related RNA phages, for example, phage MS2,7 are not amplified.",

It appears to be of a very peculiar nature. In contrast to common DNA or RNA polymerases, Q\u03b2 replicase does not utilize sequence-specific primers or promoters, and replicable RNAs share no sequence similarity except for the 5\u2032-terminal GGG and 3\u2032-terminal CCC clusters. The gross affinity to a template cannot be a basis for the observed RNA discrimination either, because Q\u03b2 replicase demonstrates similar affinities to replicable RNAs and other, including cellular, RNAs (such as most tRNAs) and only a slightly higher affinity to ssRNAs compared with dsRNAs,8 on which it cannot initiate at all.9, 10 Furthermore, recently, we found that Q\u03b2 replicase can copy a range of RNAs whose initiation (3\u2032-terminal) regions comprise diverse sequences. In each case, a full-sized complementary strand was produced.11 This means that each of these RNAs can serve as a Q\u03b2 replicase template and suggests that Q\u03b2 replicase can copy RNAs in an almost indiscriminative manner.",

At the second step (\u2018swallowing\u2019), condensation of two or more GTP molecules on a legitimate template triggers the Q\u03b2 replicase transition into the closed conformation in which the template and the nascent strand remain stably bound during the entire replication round. Initiation on an illegitimate template cannot trigger this transition, and the enzyme:RNA complex remains unstable. As a result, the template and nascent strand either prematurely dissociate (are \u2018spitted out\u2019) or collapse into a duplex.

In this article, we demonstrate that, in contrast to illegitimate templates, the 5\u2032 terminus of a legitimate template cooperates with the 3\u2032 terminus during initiation and contributes to the stability of the replicative complex after initiation. Dissociation of the molecule into 5\u2032-terminal and 3\u2032-terminal fragments and even point mutations at the 5\u2032 terminus reduce the rate of the initiation step and the overall rate of template copying, increase the GTP requirement, and destabilize the postinitiation complex.

Then, the three missing NTPs [ATP, cytidine 5\u2032-triphosphate (CTP), and uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate (UTP)] were added along with ATA, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min, which allowed a nascent strand to be elongated to the full-sized complementary copy of the template.

This is not because of an incomplete inhibition of reinitiation by ATA, in which case the net decay would slow down as the rate of decomposition of the replicative complex approaches the rate of its re-formation. Figure 4 demonstrates that, at the concentration used (1 mM), ATA completely, irreversibly, and almost instantly inhibited the initiation of RNA synthesis. That is why we were able to stop initiation at chosen time points and to measure the initiation rate. There can be a number of other possibilities. For example, the initiation complexes could have different stabilities if they involve one, two, or more replicase molecules. Alternatively, the heterogeneity of complexes could be induced by ATA itself (e.g., due to a variable ATA-to-replicase stoichiometry). Regardless of the source of the observed nonlinearity of the decay kinetics, the plots of Fig. 5 reflect real differences in the stability of postinitiation complexes formed with various RNA mutants.",

This cooperation does not require that the two termini belong to the same RNA strand. It can be observed even if the template is fragmented, provided that the fragments are held together by noncovalent interactions. However, the mode of cooperation depends on whether the template is intact or not. Whereas sensitivity of the unbroken RQ135 RNA to the 5\u2032-terminal point mutations increases after initiation, which is reflected by a more rapid decay of the replicative complex, a hybrid molecule composed of the supplementing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments of RQ135 RNA becomes insensitive to the 5\u2032-terminal mutations after initiation. The loss of sensitivity may be due to dissociation of the 5\u2032 fragment, or at least displacement of its 5\u2032-terminal segment, from the replicative complex after initiation. Indeed, despite the very different initial amounts of replicative complexes formed by the 3\u2032 fragment when it is present alone or is hybridized to the 5\u2032 fragment, whether wild type or mutant, the rates of decay of the complexes in the presence ATA are virtually identical (Fig. 5d).",

They proposed the term functional circularity to designate the putative ability of a template to present to replicase its 5\u2032 end, in addition to the 3\u2032 end, at the initiation step.20, 21 This conclusion was later disputed by Schwyzer et al. who showed that fragments substantially less than the intact Q\u03b2 RNA served as templates for the synthesis of complementary copies.22 Later, it was shown that copying of the positive Q\u03b2 RNA strand, whose length is 4217 nt, requires long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions between the 3\u2032 end and an internal segment lying up to 1500 nt upstream,23, 24 to which replicase binds with a high affinity.25, 26 Therefore, simultaneous interaction of Q\u03b2 replicase with the two sites was thought to be the mechanism for template recognition.

Indeed, probing of RQ RNAs with ribonucleases that are sensitive to the conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone strongly suggests that, whenever tested, the 3\u2032-terminal oligo(C) is in a helical structure.15, 37 Moreover, probing of the RQ135 RNA studied here indicated that the entire 15-nt-long 3\u2032-terminal segment (depicted with blue symbols in Fig. 1) is resistant to the single-strand-specific nuclease from mung beans but is attacked by ribonuclease V1 from cobra venom, which is specific to the A form of RNA helix.38 These observations could be accounted for by a model for the secondary structure of RQ135 RNA15 reproduced in Fig. 1a. A distinguishing feature of this model is an imperfect double helix jointly produced by the base-paired termini and an adjacent hairpin, reminiscent of the helix formed by the T\u03a8C hairpin and the aminoacyl acceptor stem of tRNA.39 Such a terminal helix could potentially be formed by both the positive and negative strands of every efficient Q\u03b2 replicase template, including the genomic RNA of phage Q\u03b2, and might perform two related functions: (i) to serve as an analog of \u2018panhandle,\u2019 which might circularize the template even in the absence of Q\u03b2 replicase, and (ii) to serve as a specific structure recognizable by replicase.3\n",

Each of the secondary structure models discussed above and shown in Fig. 1a and b is compatible with this feature of a legitimate template, as in each case the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 termini are not far from each other and, hence, might simultaneously be bound at the replicase active site. Initiation results in a transition of the enzyme into the closed conformation, which distinguishes the relatively narrow class of legitimate templates from a variety of illegitimate templates.11 The present data further indicate that the termini may remain to be bound by the replicase after such a transition, as long as the 5\u2032-terminal mutations affect the stability of postinitiation replicative complexes. This finding suggests that the template circularity might perform one more function \u2015 to help keep the template and the nascent strand ss, which is vital for the exponential amplification.",

Weissmann et al. pointed out that the exponential RNA synthesis can only occur if two requirements that seem to be mutually exclusive are observed.6 The synthesis of a complementary strand requires that it is base-paired with its template, but the two strands are to be nonpaired to provide for further replication, because a dsRNA cannot serve as a Q\u03b2 replicase template. To solve this paradox, they suggested that shortly after the incorporation of a nucleotide into the nascent strand, the hydrogen bonds binding it with the template are disrupted by the replicase as by a zipper and, once separated, the single strands are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds.",

However, similar topological constraints would exist if, instead of being bound with replicase at its 3\u2032 end, the template was circularized through termini secured by either a terminal helix or another replicase molecule. Unlike the butterfly structure capable of accommodating only one enzyme molecule, such a circle would allow a number of replicases to copy the same template, as previously reported.46, 47 Of course, only unbroken circles could maintain the replicative intermediate ss. We would like to note that template circularity might also help in solving a similar problem of prevention of the hydrogen bonding of the template and product strands during RNA replication in the hypothetical RNA world.48\n",

(a and b) The 5\u2032 terminus of RQ135 RNA was of the wild type (GGG) or carried the indicated mutations. (c) The 3\u2032 terminus of RQ135 RNA carried the indicated mutations, with the 5\u2032 terminus either being of wild type or carrying complementary mutations, as indicated in legends of matching colors. (d) Decay of the complexes formed by the 3\u2032 fragment alone (black lines), whose 5\u2032 terminus was wild type (GGC, filled symbols) or mutant (GGG, unfilled symbols), or by the 3\u2032 fragment hybridized with the 5\u2032 fragment (colored lines), which was of the wild type or carried 5\u2032-terminal mutations, as indicated in legends of matching colors. Gray lines in (c) and (d) are replicas of the lines from (b). Each line represents the least-squares fit through points by using the power equation (y = cebx).",
