Following an abrupt onset involving fever, myalgia, and malaise, the patients\u2019 conditions deteriorated rapidly with the onset of pulmonary edema (CDC 1993). Death often occurred just hours after the onset of this crisis period (CDC 1993). It was remarkable that the etiologic agent had not been recognized previously, because it became apparent that the natural reservoir for SNV was the widespread native deer mouse (figure 1a; Nichol et al. 1993, Childs et al. 1994) and that SNV infection occurred throughout its range in the United States (CDC 2014). Additional cases of HPS occurring prior to 1993 have been retrospectively diagnosed (e.g., Zaki et al. 1996).",

Another HPS outbreak occurred in the Four Corners region in 1997, again following an ENSO event. A third outbreak in 2006, following increased precipitation in 2004\u20132005, was forecast using satellite imagery as an indicator of primary productivity (Glass et al. 2006). Parmenter and colleagues (1993) and Yates and colleages (2002) proposed a bottom-up precipitation-driven trophic cascade to explain the HPS outbreaks. The proposed cascade involved increased primary and secondary productivity (measures of deer mouse resources) during spring\u2013summer, following enhanced winter\u2013spring precipitation. Increases in productivity were followed by increases in deer mouse abundance, infection prevalence, and ultimately, HPS cases. However, this proposed cascade continues to be discussed because of debate over regional increases in deer mouse abundance and the relationships between vegetation growth and HPS cases (Glass et al. 2000, Mills 2005).",

Following the ENSO events, these temporarily favorable environments returned to less optimal normal conditions. Glass and colleagues (2000) concluded that if links between climate variability and HPS exist (cf. Glass et al. 2007, Luis et al. 2010, Loehman et al. 2012), the underlying ecologic and social conditions that modulate these links are poorly understood.",

            "text": "Since the first identification of SNV, HPS has been diagnosed across the United States and much of Canada (CDC 2014). Within the United States, cases reflect the distribution of the deer mouse reservoir, with the majority of cases occurring in the western region of the contiguous 48 states (CDC 2014). In addition to the southwestern United States, studies of deer mice or related hosts and SNV or SNV-like hantaviruses have been undertaken in a variety of US states and regions and Canadian provinces\u2014including California; Iowa; Kansas; Michigan; Montana; New England; New York; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Texas; Virginia; Washington, DC; Wyoming; Alberta; British Columbia; Manitoba; and Saskatchewan\u2014as well as in central Mexico (e.g., see Mills et al. 1998, Bennett et al. 1999, Safronetz et al. 2006, Luong et al. 2011). Intensive studies are mostly limited to the Southwest and Montana and are particularly sparse when focused on the eastern United States, where human cases are relatively rare (figure 1b; Douglass et al. 2005, CDC 2014). Overall, the prevalence of SNV infection appears greatest among deer mice in Montana (Douglass et al. 2001). However, longitudinal data from several southwestern sites remains unpublished (Mills et al. 2010a). It is also unknown how the prevalence of SNV from the Southwest and Montana compares with that in areas in which intensive studies have not been undertaken, such as Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. In regions in which HPS cases are rare, such as the eastern United States, the available evidence indicates that the prevalence of SNV or a closely related virus among deer mice (and possibly white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus) is similar to that in states with higher HPS incidence (Mills et al. 1998, Luong et al. 2011).",

Deer mice shed SNV in saliva, urine, and possibly feces for up to 90 days following infection (Safronetz et al. 2006, Safronetz et al. 2008). Some individuals likely shed SNV throughout their lifetime, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated. Infection with SNV may influence weight gain (Douglass et al. 2007) and survival (Douglass et al. 2001, Luis et al. 2012), but see Previtali and colleagues (2010).",

However, the evidence for this autumn\u2013spring relationship has been variable (Carver et al. 2011a), indicating that temporal delays may be more complex (Adler et al. 2008a). Lags between population density and infection prevalence could be dependent on population oscillations, birth rates, mean prevalence, and frequency-dependent transmission (Adler et al. 2008a).

            "text": "The precise forecasting of deer mouse population and SNV dynamics has been hampered by complex relationships with environmental factors (e.g., Luis et al. 2010, Loehman et al. 2012). Using climatic data, Luis and colleagues (2010) developed a model that fit the population dynamics of deer mice at one location in Montana well but had relatively poor predictive ability. Temperature and precipitation fluctuated between beneficial or detrimental effects on deer mouse survival and recruitment depending on season (Luis et al. 2010), and these effects are likely to vary among habitats and climatic regimes (see also Loehman et al. 2012). These findings are supported by studies demonstrating survival to be significant for population growth rate and dispersal of infected adult males important for local SNV antibody prevalence (Glass et al. 2002, Waltee et al. 2009, Luis et al. 2010). The forecasting of deer mouse population and SNV dynamics will likely be improved by incorporating a combination of host demographic and community factors. Models by Laverty and Adler (2009) showed that long-tailed survivorship decreases the average age of infection and increases the reproductive rate of the pathogen. Age-dependent contact rates appeared more important for increasing prevalence than susceptibility or amplitude of population oscillations. Negative relationships of SNV prevalence with spatial (Bennett et al. 1999, Mills 2005) and temporal (Carver et al. 2011b) variation in small-mammal community diversity have also been demonstrated. The mechanisms underlying these negative relationships are unknown but could be due to changes in deer mouse contact patterns due to nonreservoir species presence (Carver et al. 2011b). Although technically challenging, incorporating demographic and community factors into predictive models of deer mouse and SNV dynamics will likely result in rewarding insights.",

Contact among deer mice within peridomestic environments and the transmission of SNV to humans is empirically less well understood than SNV dynamics among deer mice in the natural environment (Carver et al. 2010). The number of HPS cases is greatest in rural peridomestic environments, where SNV transmission among deer mice and human risk of exposure also appear greatest (Armstrong et al. 1995, Childs et al. 1995, Zeitz et al. 1995, Kuenzi et al. 2001, Douglass et al. 2006). In these enclosed settings, human exposure results from activities (e.g., sweeping) that aerosolize infected deer mouse excreta (Armstrong et al. 1995, Childs et al. 1995, Zeitz et al. 1995, Cline et al. 2010). Safronetz and colleagues (2006, 2008) found a higher prevalence of low-avidity immunoglobulin G antibodies (indicative of recent infection) in deer mice captured where clusters of human cases occurred, suggesting that human cases occur when transmission among deer mice is recent (see also Varner and Dearing 2012). Furthermore, SNV antibody prevalence in deer mice in and near peridomestic settings is nearly twice that in natural populations (Zeitz et al. 1995, Jay et al. 1997, Douglass et al. 2001, Kuenzi et al. 2001), and prevalence in peridomestic locations begins increasing in winter and peaks in spring through early summer, consonant with the seasonal timing of human HPS cases (Kuenzi et al. 2001).",

Most peridomestic studies are restricted to Montana, which has a semiarid climate and more widespread and persistent deer mouse populations but fewer human cases than the Southwest. Studies demonstrate that deer mice in peridomestic environments frequently enter man made structures (particularly if food resources are available) regardless of prevailing environmental conditions, have smaller home range sizes, have greater population densities, and constitute a greater proportion of the small-mammal community than in natural environments (Kuenzi et al. 2001, Douglass et al. 2006). Peridomestic deer mice can spend the majority (65%) of their time within man made structures (Douglass et al. 2006). Deer mouse excreta likely accumulate and SNV survives longer in peridomestic settings, because it is largely protected from environmental conditions that would disperse and degrade excreta (i.e., wind and precipitation) and inactivate SNV (i.e., ultraviolet radiation; Carver et al. 2010). Consequently, the persistence of infectious SNV is likely longer and the risk of exposure for humans greater in peridomestic locations (Kallio et al. 2006, Gedeon et al. 2010).",

For example, studies in the southwestern United States demonstrate relationships between increased precipitation and vegetation growth and subsequent (the following year) deer mouse abundance, infection prevalence, and HPS cases at high-elevation (2000\u20132500 meters) sites (Engelthaler et al. 1999, Glass et al. 2000, 2002, 2006, 2007). These effects are most pronounced following ENSO events and in areas where the onset of vegetation growth was earlier and persisted longer than in areas with few to no HPS cases, such as lower-elevation sites (Glass et al. 2002, Glass et al. 2007). Deer mouse populations in high\u2013HPS risk areas were also composed of older and proportionally more male individuals (Glass et al. 2002), the demographic group most likely to disperse and become infected (e.g., Waltee et al. 2009). Although these relationships have been observed in the Southwest, it is likely that environmental relationships with deer mice, SNV, and HPS vary among habitats and climatic regimes across North America (Loehman et al. 2012).",

However, there has been no extensive exploration of climate, deer mice, and SNV across the contiguous United States to examine broader determinants of human exposure risk. At a national scale, there are good surveillance data on HPS cases in the United States, and previous investigators have adjusted the cumulative case data against total and rural (where most HPS cases take place) census data (Douglass et al. 2005). We combined cumulative rural per-capita HPS data with all published studies from which we could determine trap success for deer mice (the number of deer mice per trap night is a measure of relative abundance and the most common metric that could be obtained from published studies) and SNV antibody prevalence (appendix S1). These studies could be grouped into two categories: (1) one-time or multiannual studies with once-per-year or unidentified sampling frequency and (2) longitudinal mark\u2013recapture studies with regular sampling within years. These data were matched with the mean daily temperature and precipitation within each state (National Climatic Data Center; http://ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html). Using these data, we evaluated links among geographic variation in climate, deer mouse abundance, SNV prevalence, and HPS cases. We emphasize that these relationships explored are general, broadscale indicators and\u2014although beyond the scope of this study\u2014future more spatially explicit climate variables for analyses would be valuable.",

The effects of temperature and precipitation were evaluated independently from deer mouse and SNV data, owing to climate data being available from all states reporting HPS cases. We used linear models, which were ranked using information-theoretic approaches and multimodel selection, and calculated variable importance weights (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We also explored the effects of average daily temperature and precipitation during different months of the year: The results indicated that these relationships were strongest during spring\u2013summer months (when HPS cases predominate) and weakest during fall\u2013winter months (results are not presented).",

An implicit assumption here is that the abundances and prevalences revealed by these studies and by our analyses are representative of \u201cnatural\u201d environments within and among states, although in reality, these may vary temporally and spatially. This is the only available deer mouse and SNV data for which these national analyses can be carried out.

The predictors within these hypotheses were modeled as direct and indirect to represent the differential effects of environmental variables. The direct effects of environmental variables were designed to illustrate the role of these factors on human exposure (likely through aerosolization of SNV-contaminated particulate matter). The indirect influences of these factors were modeled to represent their effects on HPS cases via deer mouse infection or natural abundance (possibly also indicating changes in the deer mouse occupancy of peridomestic structures). In hypotheses H2\u2013H6, we considered the effects of deer mouse infection (the number of infected deer mice; IPm) as a driver of human cases, which reflects general perceptions that human exposure risk is tied to the prevalence of infection in deer mouse populations or the number of infected deer mice in the environment. The number of infected deer mice was highly correlated with prevalence (figure 4), so we restricted our analyses to one predictor (IPm). Overall, these models were comparatively poor fits to the data, so represent a smaller set among the pool of hypotheses than models involving deer mouse abundance. In hypotheses H7\u2013H18, we explored the influence of deer mouse abundance on HPS cases, with a more extensive set of hypotheses reflecting the direct and indirect influences of environmental variables.",

Lagged deer mouse abundance was the most common predictor of the number of HPS cases across the top models, followed by the direct effects of temperature and, to a lesser extent, precipitation. Overall, these results suggested that we could not clearly discriminate among a large proportion of our hypotheses (8 out of 18 models with a change in AIC [\u0394AIC] of less than 4) given the heterogeneity in the system across all seasons. By restricting analyses to spring\u2013summer, we demonstrated improvements in predictive ability of HPS case numbers and discrimination among hypotheses (table 3). Three hypotheses were supported as being most parsimonious (a \u0394AIC of less than 4; Burnham and Anderson 2002), with the top model explaining 43% of the observed variation in HPS case numbers (figure 5) and being greater than four times more likely than the following two, based on model weights (table 3). The top model suggests that natural deer mouse abundance 3 months earlier predicts spring\u2013summer human exposure to SNV (hypothesis H7). The following two most parsimonious hypotheses both included deer mouse abundance and added the direct effects (environmental effects modeled to represent their influence on particle aerosolization) of temperature and precipitation, respectively (coefficients = 0.027 and 0.037, standard deviations [SD] = 0.154 and 1.691, respectively; table 3).

Our hypotheses and findings linking environmental moisture and, to a lesser extent, temperature to HPS cases help to mechanistically explain the variation in cases of HPS at local and broad geographic scales. In particular, HPS cases showed an exponential decline associated with increasing average daily precipitation at a regional scale. However, local (natural) deer mouse abundance\u2014not the indirect environmental effects\u2014was the best predictor of HPS cases 3 months later, during spring\u2013summer. This result suggests that in the arid environment of Zuni, New Mexico, HPS cases (and possibly prolonged peridomestic occupancy by deer mice and associated SNV transmission) may primarily be a functional response to natural deer mouse abundance 3 months prior rather than a response to environmental effects. The three-month delay could reflect a number of ecological processes, including the movement of deer mice from natural to peridomestic environments, the amplification of peridomestic transmission among deer mice, the accumulation of SNV-contaminated excreta, and human behaviors that aerosolize particulates. We propose that in arid and potentially semiarid regions, environmental conditions (e.g., as occurring in La Ni\u00f1a\u2013El Ni\u00f1o oscillations in the southwestern United States) led to the local amplification and dispersal of deer mice to these normally suboptimal areas and may therefore be an important driver of prolonged peridomestic occupancy and, consequently, HPS cases. Figure 6 illustrates our findings and proposed mechanisms and is particularly relevant to arid environments. We also suggest a framework for how a differential equation model could be structured to model these suggested dynamics (figure 7). We expect that in areas normally suboptimal for deer mouse survival, peridomestic occupancy would likely be proportional to natural deer mouse abundance in the months prior. During the summer, peridomestic structures in arid environments are cooler and more humid than the natural environment (Erlandson et al. 2003) and therefore are more suitable for the survival of rodents (Studier and Baca 1968) and the persistence of SNV (Kaillio et al. 2006). Our proposed mechanism and supporting model have not yet been empirically tested, but the results of this study suggest it is a crucial frontier for understanding SNV and HPS (table 4). It is important to acknowledge that the deer mouse and SNV data available for these analyses are from natural sites, and the strength of their relationships to HPS cases in our analyses would likely be significantly improved by matching data from relevant peridomestic sites. Additional research quantifying the environmental determinants of the propensity of deer mice to move from occupying natural to occupying peridomestic environments would also improve insight into the mechanisms underscoring reservoir\u2013human interactions and HPS exposure. No published study has made temporally paired comparisons of deer mouse abundance between natural and peridomestic habitats (Carver et al. 2010) or how transmission rates among deer mice change within buildings or along a moisture gradient.",

(b) How is aerosolization of particulate matter affected by environmental humidity? (c) What are the temporal patterns of SNV shedding following deer mouse exposure, and what is the environmental persistence of SNV in their excreta?

(e) What quantities of aerosolized particulate matter are generated by various anthropogenic activities (e.g., Richardson et al. 2013)? (f) What are the inhalation rates of particulate matter by humans during activities within these buildings? The classification of these processes will help determine the force of infection for humans, which remains poorly parameterized (Carver et al. 2010).

Cited links between climate change and SNV activity are limited to three climatic events in the southwestern United States (Engelthaler et al. 1999, Yates et al. 2002, Glass et al. 2006). Several papers cite SNV as an example of a zoonotic pathogen whose activity is linked to climatic factors (e.g., Cook et al. 2004, Patz et al. 2005). However, general predictions of the effects of climate change on the dynamics of SNV lack empirical testing.",

The predicted climatic changes during the twenty-first century for the eight states in the United States with the highest cumulative rural HPS incidence (New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, and Idaho; Douglass et al. 2005) include increased frequency and length of heatwaves, increased \u00adfrequency and duration of precipitation events, and, importantly, increased frequency of extreme precipitation events (DeGaetano and Allen 2002, Kunkel et al. 2003, Groisman et al. 2005). Such climatic and ensuing environmental conditions support the expansion of deer mouse populations in normally arid habitats that are adjacent to humans (Glass et al. 2000, Glass et al. 2002, Dearing and Dizney 2010, Kumar et al. 2010). When the predicted changes in climate for states with high HPS cases and the existing relationships with ENSO in the southwestern United States are taken into account, it appears that future climatic changes may result in a greater number of HPS cases and outbreaks in arid and semiarid regions of North America.",

            "text": "The importance of a deepened understanding of the drivers of zoonotic disease risk is not limited to SNV and extends to other epidemiologically important hantaviruses and emerging infectious diseases. There are a number of remarkable similarities among pathogenic hantaviruses, including that they have rodent reservoirs and are mostly host specific (Mills et al. 2010a), with the inhalation of aerosolized infectious particles being the most common route of human exposure (Armstrong et al. 1995, Schmaljohn and Hjelle 1997). The timing of human cases is also remarkably similar (predominantly in spring and fall), likely because of common periods of peak transmission among reservoirs (Niklasson et al. 1995, Piudo et al. 2005, Mills et al. 2010a) and the timing of activities that bring rodents and humans together. The environmental drivers of reservoir\u2013human interactions for most epidemiologically important hantaviruses are less broadly understood than those for SNV, but these interactions are commonly associated with anthropogenic areas, particularly peridomestic and agricultural settings (Zeier et al. 2005, Schwarz et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2009). Therefore, research into the drivers of reservoir use of these areas and the timing associated with human outbreaks would be valuable and broaden our understanding of the mechanisms that underscore human exposure to hantaviruses generally. This is exemplified by Puumala virus, for which evidence is similarly supportive of the climatic drivers of peridomestic occupancy by reservoir hosts being important for reservoir\u2014human interactions (particularly in southern Germany) and disease incidence (Winter et al. 2009).",

We have also demonstrated surprising findings, particularly that natural deer mouse prevalence of infection was poorly predictive of HPS cases. This deepened understanding of complex drivers influencing reservoir\u2013human interactions and human disease has highlighted the need for new avenues of research clarifying the environmental determinants of reservoir behavior, reservoir\u2013human interactions, and HPS.

The solid arrows indicate direct relationships. The dashed arrow indicates an indirect relationship. Where indicated, the approximate timescales of events are given in parentheses. The size of the SNV image (the box) is illustrative of prevalence, given deer mouse abundance and the environments in which they exist. The natural environment is broadly categorized into optimal and suboptimal habitats, in which deer mouse populations are persistent and unstable respectively. El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events promote deer mouse resources in the natural environment (the relative influence of ENSO in optimal and suboptimal environments is illustrated by the size of resource images), ultimately resulting in increased deer mouse abundance 1 year later. Regional increases in resources result in local expansion of small deer mouse populations and deer mice dispersing into suboptimal habitats. During spring\u2013summer, as seasonal climatic conditions change in suboptimal habitats, deer mouse populations die-off/die-back or occupy peridomestic structures for prolonged periods. Greater interactions among deer mice within peridomestic environments result in intraspecific transmission and virus shedding into the environment. During these periods, human activities that aerosolize SNV-contaminated deer mouse excreta increase human exposure risk.",

Susceptible deer mice (SPm) in both natural and peridomestic environments are borne (b) and die (d). The propensity of deer mice to occupy peridomestic structures is determined by environmental (e) factors and local deer mouse abundance (SPm and IPm). Deer mice become infected (IPm) at rate (\u03b2Sy Pm) in natural environments and at rate (\u03b2Pd Pm) in peridomestic environments. Susceptible humans (Sh) become exposed to aerosolized particles contaminated with SNV and infected (Ih) at rate (\u03b2Pd h). This simple model can easily be modified to include more complex determinants of deer mouse population dynamics, SNV transmission dynamics, and human exposure.",
