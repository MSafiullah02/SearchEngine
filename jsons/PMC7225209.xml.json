Due to the drastic surge of patients worldwide, many countries are considering or already graduating senior health professional students early to join the workforce. Meanwhile, inexperience in such urgent situations may be particularly stressful for students graduating directly to responsibilities in the pandemic crisis. Leveraging a prospective cohort of health professional students in China, we aimed to assess the COVID-19 related psychological distress and to identify high-risk groups who might benefit from supportive measures.",

A total of 131 (9.08%) students showed signs of both distress and ASR. Students who showed psychological distress were more likely to be female and at higher levels of baseline depression, anxiety, and stress, compared with those who did not show distress (p < 0.05; online Supplementary Table S2).

Although symptoms are common, the prevalence is much lower in students, at least in the early phase of the outbreak, than that in healthcare workers. Lai et al. reported that about 72% of healthcare workers had probable ASR assessed by the same questionnaire, although 60% of the participants were working frontline in Wuhan (Lai et al., 2020), the first epicenter. The notable difference in prevalence between health professional students and frontline workers may signal a potentially critical development if inexperienced students are graduating into this battle without support. It is, however, noteworthy that we only assessed distress once in the early phase of the outbreak. Given the ongoing pandemic, further studies on mental health over time and a confirmation of ASR development after trauma are needed.",

These data add to the knowledge that emotional support from the family before trauma may better prepare an individual's resilience to stress, independently of baseline stress levels. Social media use is often correlated with anxiety (Vannucci, Flannery, & Ohannessian, 2017). Our prospective data showed that students reported some signs of internet addiction are at higher risk of distress and ASR during the outbreak. Future studies are needed to assess whether expanding online consulting particularly during the outbreak is effective to reduce stress among individuals with internet addiction. It is well-known that adverse experiences are associated with higher stress levels (Tortella-Feliu et al., 2019). Our findings confirmed the role of adversities in response to the outbreak.",
