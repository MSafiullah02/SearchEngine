A viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most common infection of the respiratory tract. \u2022 In developing countries, acute respiratory infection remains a leading cause of childhood mortality, causing an estimated 1.5-2 million deaths annually in children younger than 5 years of age. \u2022 In developed countries viruses are responsible for most upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including pharyngitis and pneumonia. \u2022 Although the degree of fever cannot differentiate between viral and bacterial diseases, high fever is associated with a greater incidence of serious bacterial diseases such as pneumonia or meningitis. \u2022 Worldwide, diarrhoeal disease is the leading cause of childhood deaths under 5 years of age. \u2022 If the fever does not have an evident source, urinary tract infection should be considered, particularly if the fever is greater than 39.0 \u00b0C and longer than 24-48 h. \u2022 Widespread vaccinations against bacteria causing meningitis, such as Hib, and vaccines against meningococci and pneumococci have dramatically reduced the incidence of meningitis. \u2022 A child with fever and non-blanching rash should be promptly evaluated to exclude meningococcal diseases. \u2022 Young children with malaria may present with irregular fever and not with typical paroxysms of fever, occurring particularly in early falciparum infection or as a consequence of previous chemoprophylaxis, which modifies the typical pattern of fever.",

            "text": "An URTI (known as the common cold) is an exceedingly frequent infection characterized by nasal obstruction and discharge, cough, sore throat, with or without fever, decreased appetite and restless sleep. The initial watery nasal discharge is followed rapidly by mucopurulent nasal discharge, which does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection. It has been estimated that young children may have as many as 12 respiratory infections per year if he or she attends nursery, 9 infections per year if a sibling attends school, and 6 or 7 per year if the child and a sibling are not at school. Well over 100 viruses are known to cause respiratory tract infection, such as rhinoviruses (most common virus), influenza A and B, coronaviruses, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). Infection may result from inhalation, self-inoculation to the nasal mucosa or airborne inoculation to the conjunctival mucosa. Children tend to have greater concentrations of viruses in the nasal secretion and shed them for longer periods of time than adults. Viraemia is less common and the infection is usually restricted to the mucosa, including the sinuses and Eustachian tube. Viral URTI may be complicated by secondary bacterial infections including acute otitis media and sinusitis. Acute idiopathic pericarditis (presents as chest pain and pericardial rubs on auscultation) is a rare complication that is usually preceded by a recent URTI. Infection with influenza viruses occurs during annual winter epidemics and is usually a self-limited illness. However, it can cause severe illness and deaths, particularly in children with high-risk medical conditions and neurological, genetic and chromosomal disorders.",

            "text": "A clear distinction between bronchiolitis and bronchitis in the first 2 years of life is difficult and of no therapeutic significance. Both are preceded by URTI. About 20% of children develop bronchiolitis during their first year of life. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is made in the presence of a history of an URTI followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, breathlessness, wheezing, tachypnoea and clinical signs of chest inflation, occurring during a winter epidemic of bronchiolitis. RSV accounts for 60-80% of cases. Peak age is 4-6 months. Pre-existing chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, prematurity and parental smoking are risk factors for severe presentation of bronchiolitis. Fever in bronchiolitis: Information on the incidence of fever in bronchiolitis or on its relationship to clinical severity of bronchiolitis is limited. In a study of 90 children with bronchiolitis [2] , fever (defined as a single recording of >38 \u00b0C or two successive recording >37.8 \u00b0C) was present in 28 infants (31%). Febrile children had a longer mean hospital stay and a more severe clinical course compared to those who were afebrile (Table 5. 3). In infants with bronchiolitis, hypoxia is common and as many as 40-50% require oxygen supplementation. A rise of body temperature results in an increase in energy expenditure of about 10% for each 1 \u00b0C rise in temperature. These changes are accompanied by an increase in oxygen consumption of 10-12% for every 1 \u00b0C rise in temperature. The low incidence of fever in bronchiolitis may be due to low interferon production. Although interferon is known to be a potent endogenous pyrogen, this cytokine is significantly low during acute RSV bronchiolitis. RSV induces pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u0251) that cause fever and attract inflammatory leukocytes.",

However, the bacterial incidence has significantly decreased after the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type B and conjugate pneumonia vaccine PCV7. Peak incidence occurs between 6 months and 5 years. Factors that increase the risk of pneumonia include malnutrition, parental smoking, immunosuppression, low socio-economic status and prematurity. In recent years, HIV infection has contributed to increases in incidence and mortality. The lungs are not only involved in gas exchange but also in mediating host defence. This includes non-immunological defence mechanisms (such as lysozyme secretion by macrophages) and immunological defence mechanisms (such as activation of macrophages and B-and T-lymphocytes). The alveolar macrophages respond to activation by exogenous pyrogens (such as endotoxin released by Gramnegative bacteria) by releasing potent inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-8.

Cytokines are responsible for the symptoms and development of the protective mechanisms in the disease. Mean serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, TNF-gamma and IL-12 are increased during the acute phase of the disease. IL-8 and IL-10 are involved in the pathogenesis of rotavirus GE. \u2022 Diarrhoea is usually more frequent in afebrile than in febrile cases. \u2022 Children with bacterial GE are more likely to develop high fever than those with viral GE, and there is a significant relation higher fever and shigella GE. \u2022 In a study from Finland [7] comprising 102 children salmonella gastroenteritis, 15 had a fever >40 \u00b0C, 66 had a fever of 38-39.9 \u00b0C and 21 had a temperature of <37.9 \u00b0C. There was a significant correlation between the degree of fever and the duration of organism excretion: a fever of >40 \u00b0C had the shortest and no fever the longest duration of excretion (Table 5 .9). Fever therefore appears to have a favourable prognostic influenza on the duration of salmonella excretion. The gastrointestinal tract acts as a major barrier against the potentially noxious substances, such as microbes. Immunological defences include secretory IgA, mac- Fever is beneficial to the infected host by enhancing macrophage and T-and B-cell activity. \u2022 Convulsion may occur during the diarrhoeal disease. About 10% develop febrile or afebrile seizures. Febrile seizures (FS) are particularly common with shigella infection. Occasionally, afebrile seizure may occur in association with dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycaemia or hypocalcaemia. A third form of seizure is an afebrile seizure, particularly during viral GE, without dehydration of electrolyte imbalance. This type of seizure is usually benign. CSF and EEG are normal. Paracetamol has not been shown to prevent FS. \u2022 Ibuprofen is an antipyretic that is frequently administered for febrile children with GE. Acute renal insufficiency may occur in association with ibuprofen and should therefore be avoided.",

Malnutrition was an underlying cause in over 50% of the deaths. These children are particularly susceptible to measles and tuberculosis. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) has been divided into severe (kwashiorkor, marasmus and intermediate cases), moderate severe (nutritional, dwarfing or stunting and wasting) and early (clinically detectable only by anthropometric measurement). In developing countries, the severe form of malnutrition is common as a result of several factors, including severe dietary imbalance. Marasmus results from deficiency of all nutrients, whereas kwashiorkor is due primarily to protein deficiency. In developed countries, PCM may result from debilitating chronic diseases",
