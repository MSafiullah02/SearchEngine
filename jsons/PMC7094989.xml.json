Transcript expression was monitored using SYBR Fast qPCR master mix kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) with corresponding primers. The fluorescence signals were measured using the 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The specificity of the SYBR\u00ae Green PCR signal was confirmed by melting curve analysis. The threshold cycle (CT) was defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence reached 10 times the standard deviation of the base-line (from cycle 2 to 10). The ratio change in target gene relative to the \u03b2-actin control gene was determined by the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method.

In human astrocytes, the viral titer of H7N9 virus was undetectable. Interestingly, in infected neuronal cells, H7N9 virus replicated effectively and produced infectious progeny viruses with viral titer significantly increasing from 48 h onwards after infection. No detectable progeny of the two pdmH1N1 viruses was detected from the infected astrocytic and neuronal cells. For comparison, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages produced infectious progeny virus efficiently for all three viral strains, with significant increase in viral titer from 24 to 72 h after infection. As astrocytes seemed not to support the progeny viral production for all the three viral strains examined, we have included an avian H5N1 influenza virus (A/Vietnam/3212/2004) which reported previously to produce infectious progeny virus in astrocytes (Ng et al. 2010) for comparison (Fig. 3c). Significant increase in H5N1 progeny viral titer was detectable from 48 h post-infection onwards, suggesting T98G cells are in fact permissive to influenza virus infection.",

Here, we determined the cytokine expression profiles in human brain cells infected by H7N9 virus compared to that of pdmH1N1 virus infection. In both human astrocytes and neuronal cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 as well as type I IFN, IFN-\u03b2 were significantly upregulated at 24 h after infection by H7N9 virus, while both pdmH1N1 virus strains induced only little to no cytokine expression (Fig. 4a, b). Of note, H7N9 virus induced IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and IFN-\u03b2 expression was found to be more potent in infected astrocytes compared to that in neuronal cells. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 have been reported to be associated with influenza virus-related acute encephalitis/encephalopathy (Aiba et al. 2001; Ichiyama et al. 1998), and are commonly expressed upon influenza virus infection (Cheung et al. 2002; Paquette et al. 2012). Absence of induction of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in pdmH1N1 virus-infected human astrocytic and neuronal cells prompted us to investigate if this effect is cell-type specific. Notwithstanding with the outcome observed in human astrocytes and neuronal cells, expression of TNF-\u03b1 in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 4c) could be detected as early as at 1 h post-infection and further increased at 3 h after infection by pdmH1N1-complicated virus (H1/1750/11) and was significantly higher compared to that by pdmH1N1 (H1/415742/09) virus. Similarly, expression of IL-6 was significantly higher in pdmH1N1-complicated (H1/1750/11) virus compared to pdmH1N1 (H1/415742/09) virus-infected human macrophages. This data suggested that pdmH1N1 can in fact hyper-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in a cell-type and viral strain-specific manner.",

During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which was the deadliest influenza outbreak, several patients who recovered from the disease subsequently developed psychosis and encephalitic Parkinsonism (Dickman 2001). Accordingly, encephalopathy is important complication associated with influenza infection, described most frequently in young children, particularly in Japan and East Asia (Ekstrand 2012). There were human pdmH1N1 cases reported to have neurological complications including acute encephalopathy, altered mental status, and seizures. Cerebral edema and brainstem lesions can be detected by computed tomography scanning in some patients. Santini et al. report the cases of three pdmH1N1 virus-infected adult patients with viral RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (Santini et al. 2012). In our study, pdmH1N1 viruses could infect and transcribe their viral genome in astrocytic and neuronal cells. However, these viruses failed to produce infectious progeny viruses and did not cause or just exhibited minor cytopathic effects in the two brain resident cells. Although, there were no remarkable difference between the two pdmH1N1 strains with respect to viral replication kinetics and cytokine induction in human brain cells, our data (Fig. 4c) here demonstrated that pdmH1N1 viruses isolated from neurologically complicated case (H1/1750/11) induced much higher pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in primary human macrophages at early post-infection time. This suggests that pdmH1N1-associated neurological complications are more likely to be a consequence of peripheral viral infection rather than caused by direct invasion of the brain, while the detailed mechanisms underlying the neurological symptoms deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "We previously demonstrated that the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza can infect human astrocytic and neuronal cells, resulting in the induction of severe CPE and pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades (Ng et al. 2010). In the present study, we extend our study to investigate the tropism and replication competence of lately emerging avian H7N9 virus and found that H7N9 virus could also infect, replicate, produce infectious progeny viruses, and cause CPE in human neuronal cells. More remarkably, H7N9 virus induced potent cytokine expression in human brain cells, suggesting that H7N9 virus infection may potentially cause profound CNS injury. Of note, our present data suggested that neurons could be a major source for H7N9 virus production in human brain (Fig. 3c), whereas astrocytes being the most abundant glial cells in human brain (Guillamon-Vivancos et al. 2015) could be an important producer in the brain infected with H7N9 virus. There was a more differential upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and IFN-\u03b2) in infected astrocytes (Fig. 4a) compared to that in neuronal cells (Fig. 4b). In particular, the induction level of IL-6 was remarkably elevated in astrocytes, which normally secrete neurotrophic factors and cytokines to regulate immune responses in the brain (Jensen et al. 2013; van Heteren et al. 2008). As a result, the dysregulated cytokine profile of astrocytes could lead to CNS complications and further trigger inflammatory cascade and cause damage in the brain in addition to the direct CPE due to influenza infection. Indeed, some studies report a significant association between increased secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and the incidence of influenza virus-related acute encephalitis/encephalopathy (Ichiyama et al. 1998; Ito et al. 1999). In addition, astrocytes and neuronal cells could cross talk and interact in an autocrine/paracrine manner. The treatment of differentiated astrocytes with TNF-\u03b1 gradually increases IL-6 expression in astrocytes for up to 3 days and causes a substantial loss of cell adhesion (Ng et al. 2010; van Kralingen et al. 2013). Astrocytes produce IL-8 in respond to TNF-\u03b1 stimulation (Aloisi et al. 1992). IL-8 secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid has been suggested to correlate with the dysfunction in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kossmann et al. 1997). As the BBB is important in controlling viral invasion into the central nervous system, hyper-induction of IL-8 by astrocytes may lead to a detrimental disease outcome during H7N9 infection via increasing the BBB permeability to virus infection. Another cytokine, CCL2 has also been reported to be induced upon TNF-\u03b1 stimulation (He et al. 2016). CCL2 produced from astrocytes and neurons activates microglials to M1 phenotype (He et al. 2016) and recruits inflammatory monocytes to the brain (Howe et al. 2017) which could lead to neurodegeneration (He et al. 2016; Howe et al. 2017). In the present study, most cytokine induced by H7N9 infection in astrocytes was detected at a later infection stage, implying that cytokine induction may not be a direct effect of virus infection but is more likely to be a result of cross talk with other infected cells by autocrine/paracrine feedback in a pro-inflammatory cascade. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that upon viral infection, astrocytes are one of the major resident IFN-producing cells in the CNS (Kallfass et al. 2012); this is corroborated by the findings of the present study as H7N9-infected astrocytes exhibited over a 1000-fold increase in IFN-\u03b2 induction.",

            "text": "Intrinsic difference in the magnitude of viral mRNA transcription was observed between H7N9 and pdmH1N1 virus in astrocytes and neuronal cells but not in macrophages. H7N9 virus has a more pronounced viral mRNA transcription in differentiated human brain cells compared to that of H1N1 virus. In fact, both viral mRNA and vRNA can be detected suggesting a productive transcription of viral mRNA from vRNA and replication of vRNA through cRNA synthesis in H7N9 and pdmH1N1 virus-infected astrocytes and neuronal cells. Failure in infectious progeny virus production in astrocytes may be due to many factors such as inhibition in viral mRNA translation, aberrant post-translation modifications, attenuation in viral assembly, or budding during the replication cycle. For example, aberrant post-translation modifications of viral proteins such as viral HA N-glycosylation (Rossignol et al. 2009) has been reported to affect influenza virus progeny production. Failure in nuclear export of nascent viral ribonucleoprotein complex as a result of expression of host restriction factors (Qiao et al. 2018), perturbation in intracellular trafficking of influenza viral protein due to disruption in intracellular trafficking machineries (Ramos-Nascimento et al. 2017), or attenuation in viral assembly or budding during the replication cycle. Of interest, astrocytes are believed to be a major cholesterol producer in the brain (Ferris et al. 2017) and cholesterol homeostasis has been suggested to play important role in the production of progeny virus (Musiol et al. 2013), whether this could be part of an explanation for the lack of progeny virus generated from H7N9 and pdmH1N1 virus-infected astrocytes remained to be investigated.",

The findings here provide important insights into the neuropathogenesis of this virus. In summary, we demonstrated that avian H7N9 virus effectively produce infectious progeny and cause severe CPE in human neuronal cells. The pdmH1N1 viruses cannot produce progeny viruses in either cell type. In comparison to pdmH1N1 viruses, the H7N9 virus exhibits a higher capacity to elicit pro-inflammatory innate immune responses in human brain cells. These phenotypic differences among viruses may be relevant to the pathogenesis of neurological complications occurring after H7N9 virus infection. Observation for neurological problems due to H7N9 virus infection deserves further attention when managing these patients.",
