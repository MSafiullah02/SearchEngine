It is a one-step multiplex RT-PCR system for the detection of influenza virus type A and type B, human respiratory syncytial virus type A, B; human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43, human parainfluenza type 1, 2, 3, human rhinovirus type A, B, human enterovirus, and bocavirus 1, 2, 3, 4. The article presents research conducted on the basis of swabs collected from patients who came to the Ear, Nose, and Throat Emergency Care Unit at the Department of Otolaryngology, Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, in February 2013. Due to the nature of work in an laryngological emergency ward, the material was collected only from those patients who reported problems associated with rhinitis or any dysfunction of the upper respiratory tract. The study shows that patients who came to seek laryngological assistance were usually infected with viruses having affinity for the airway epithelium.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The laboratory diagnostics of virological infections in the respiratory system is currently based primarily on modern methods of molecular biology. Serological methods, and in the case of influenza virus infection also a viral culture in chick embryo, constitute a smaller value for diagnostics, because of the time needed to obtain a result, although they are still considered to be the gold standard in virological studies of the respiratory system. The respiratory tract infection is divided into upper and lower respiratory tract infection. However, the upper respiratory tract infections constitute a preliminary stage to the infection of the bronchi and lung parenchyma. Chronic heart and lung diseases, diabetes, cancer, renal failure, hematopoietic system diseases, and other chronic diseases occur more frequently as complications in the case of patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections involving the respiratory viruses (Kim et al. 2013 ). In such a case, especially when the patient with severe symptoms of respiratory tract infection and associated immune disorders or the comorbidities comes to the laryngological ER, the virological laboratory diagnostics allowing for the identification of the etiological agent is extremely helpful.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 945, "end": 961, "text": "(Kim et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Respiratory tract infections are the most frequent cause of visits to the doctor.

The kit contains a set of reagents due to which it is possible to perform a Multiplex PCR. Simplification of the two-step method results in an increased repeatability of analysis and efficiency of reaction. The kit for determining 15 respiratory viruses in a sample of a clinical material is based on a process of reverse transcription (RT) and amplification of the target DNA by PCR using Dual Priming Oligonucleotide (DPO) primers, which provides freedom in a primer design and PCR optimisation and maximizes PCR specificity and sensitivity by fundamentally blocking non-specific priming. The DPO-based multiplex assay that permits the simultaneous amplification of target sequences of 15 viruses, presented after the amplification reaction, uses e.g., electrophoresis in an agarose gel preceded by nucleic acid isolation (Kim et al. 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1101, "end": 1118, "text": "(Kim et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Carrying Out a PCR Reaction"}, {"text": "The kit consists of three panels/sets A, B, C, each containing reagents and primers for the detection of five respiratory viruses (details are given in Table 2 ) and includes two internal controls: PCR control and the control of the whole process.

Additionally, 8-methoxypsoralen was used, which suppresses the activity of a DNA template.

The gel was solidified using special well combs and mixtures, after amplification, were applied to the resulting holes in the agarose. The mixture also contained a loading dye. This procedure makes it possible to control the electrophoretic separation process using the kit for electrophoresis Wide Mini-SubCell GT/PowerPac Basic System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Thus, the electrophoresis was carried out by controlling the migration of PCR products in a gel by placing a loading dye -bromphenol blue. To get the maximum separation of DNA fragments, the electric field did not exceed 5 V/cm of the gel.
