DV is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and fusion occurs between the viral and the endosome membranes in the acidic environment of this compartment. Insights into this protein-mediated process have been achieved by the determination of the pre- and post-fusion structures of the flavivirus E glycoproteins.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Exposure to low pH triggers the dissociation of E dimers that lie flat on the virion's surface and promotes a change in their conformation, causing E-protein trimers to form and protrude from the envelope.11 The segment between residues 98 and 112 forms a loop in domain II of E glycoprotein8 and has been considered to be the fusion peptide of the flaviviruses because (i) it presents almost 100% homology among all the members of the Flaviviridae family (it is identical in all of them, except for a single residue in the tick-borne encephalitis virus); (ii) site-directed mutagenesis in that region prevents the virus fusion;11 and (iii) it is located at the tip of the trimeric fusogenic structure of the protein.8 It has been suggested that the rearrangement caused by exposure of E protein to low pH starts the fusion process by causing the fusion peptide to become exposed and bind to the target membrane.8, 11, 12\n",

To fill this gap, several groups have used solution NMR to solve the 3D structure of micelle-bound fusion peptides, such as those from influenza hemaglutinin17 and HIV gp41,18 which are class I viral fusion glycoproteins. However, no solution structure is available yet for class II fusion peptides, which include flavivirus and alphavirus glycoproteins.",

In addition, we found evidence for oligomerization of this fragment in the membrane, which might reflect the in vivo trimerization of the E glycoprotein. In the present work, we have extended this study with a fragment that exactly comprises the conserved fusion peptide, aiming to characterize both structurally and functionally its interaction with membrane models as a means to better understand the role of the fusion loop in the process of the DV infection. It is worth mentioning that, despite the DV E-glycoprotein structure having been solved in pre- and post-fusion states by X-ray crystallography, none of the structures involved interaction with phospholipids or mimetic membranes. Therefore, using NMR techniques, we determined the structure of the peptide interacting with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and mapped the residues that interact with phospholipid vesicles in fusogenic conditions, revealing a crucial role for W101.",

A K\np of (2.6 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 103, indicative of a relatively strong binding, was obtained after fitting by Eq. (1). Knowing that the fusion peptide is in fast equilibrium exchange between its free state in solution and being bound to the LUVs [see below, with transfer-nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiments], it is plausible to conclude that PG favors a strong interaction with the fusion peptide, thus leading to the membrane fusion observed in Fig. 1a.",

            "text": "Albeit LUVs mimic more realistically the cellular environment encountered by DV during infection, their large correlation time hampers their use in the structure determination of proteins/peptides at high atomic resolution by NMR spectroscopy, since the proton signals of the bound peptide are broadened out. To overcome the peak broadening, surfactants are used instead of vesicles, since they can form micelles of sizes suitable for the NMR technique. The ability of the DV fusion peptide to interact with surfactants was clear from the tryptophan fluorescence change upon addition of either DPC or SDS micelles (Fig. 2b). The spectral blue shift indicated the incorporation of the tryptophan indole side chain into a less polar environment. Nonetheless, although both surfactants promote a blue shift in the W101 fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2b, inset), the increase of its fluorescence intensity in DPC was twice that in SDS, which indicates a more extensive partition to DPC and/or a more hydrophobic local microenvironment for the tryptophan residue. It is worth mentioning that micellar systems mimic biological membranes quite well, in the sense that micelles provide a noncontinuous environment with a water\u2013aliphatic chain interface. However, the combination of the fast dynamic and high curvature of micellar systems makes the aliphatic hydrophobic chains much more available to interact with peptides, meaning that the micelles stabilize the bound conformational state, which is favorable for NMR structural determination. On the other hand, the interaction of the peptide with LUVs is much more sensitive to the chemical characteristics of the phospholipids and, thus, much more informative about the peptide specificity toward different membranes.23\n",

            "text": "NMR spectroscopy is an excellent technique to map interactions between macromolecules because the nuclei chemical shifts, especially 1H nuclei, are very sensitive to any change around their environment. More importantly, this technique can identify which nuclei are involved in such interactions. Differences in the 1H chemical shifts of the peptide upon addition of micelles were an indication of interaction and also showed that the signal from the micelle-bound peptide protons could be measured, a necessary condition for the determination of the interacting peptide structure. In order to determine the best [detergent]/[peptide] ratio to be used for solving the 3D structure of the DV fusion peptide, titrations of 2  mM peptide with increasing concentrations of d25-SDS or d38-DPC were carried out. In the titration with d25-SDS, there were significant 1H chemical-shift changes when 15  mM of this detergent was added, but no further change was observed above this concentration. Conversely, in the titration with d38-DPC, large changes in the 1H chemical shifts of the DV fusion peptide were detected as the detergent concentration was increased from 0 to 64  mM. We also observed greater chemical-shift dispersion with d38-DPC, suggestive of gain of structure. Increasing the concentration of this detergent to 100 mM did not change chemical-shift dispersion, but led to sharp lines, indicating a decrease in conformational exchange that usually is interpreted as the stabilization of the bound state of the peptide. No further significant changes were observed above this detergent concentration. Based not only on these titrations experiments but also on the fluorescence experiment, we concluded that the interaction between the DV fusion peptide and d38-DPC would mimic more realistically its interaction with vesicles and, thus, with cellular membranes, which led us to choose DPC micelles to perform the structure determination. To guarantee that all peptide molecules would be bound to the micelles, 100  mM d38-DPC was chosen in order to obtain a [detergent]/[peptide] ratio of 50:1.",

Moreover, the central region (segment W101\u2013F108) of the DPC-bound DV fusion peptide correlates very well to the structure of this region when it is attached to the full-length E-glycoprotein fusion loop, as solved by X-ray crystallography in either pre- or post-fusion state. The r.m.s.d. between the NMR and crystallographic structure is 3.41 \u00c5; the r.m.s.d. between the pre- and post-fusion states of this segment in the crystal structures is 0.24 \u00c5.7, 8 The loop conformation formed by the segment 101\u2013108 (Fig. 3, magenta residues) was maintained, as well as the spatial confluence of the W101 and F108 residues. The interactions among these hydrophobic residues are based on long-range cross-peak NOEs between W101 and L107 protons, namely, HN\u2013HN, H\u03b4\u2013H\u025b, and H\u03b4\u2013H\u03b6 NOEs. A long-range interaction was also observed between H\u03b6 of W101 and H\u03b1 of G106. Additionally, the protons of the residues L107 and F108 make several i, i\n + 1 contacts such as H\u03b1\u2013H\u03b1, HN\u2013HN, H\u03b1\u2013H\u03b2, and H\u03b1\u2013H\u03b4. However, no cross-peak NOE between W101 and F107 side chains was assigned, although they are very close to each other according to the solution structure (Table 2\n). One explanation for this result may be the large number of overlapping peaks in the NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum and/or the intrinsic flexibility of the side chain. Furthermore, the segments W101\u2013G102 and G106\u2013L107 establish the majority of the longer-range NOE interactions, in agreement with the hydrogen bond formed between the Trp101 H\u025b1 and the Gly106 carbonyl observed in the X-ray structure; it was also observed that the loop in the 103\u2013105 residues, present in both NMR and X-ray structures, is formed due to the interactions between flanking residues 101\u2013102 and 106\u2013107, despite not being involved in many long-range interactions itself. According to the electrostatic surface potential of the DV fusion peptide bound to DPC micelles in the fusogenic condition (Fig. 4\na\u2013d), there is a hydrophobic patch formed by the loop residues W101\u2013F108, which might be responsible for the E-glycoprotein penetration into the cellular membrane during the fusion process, as already hypothesized by Modis and coworkers.8 Furthermore, the hydrophobic patch is surrounded by positively charged residues, characteristic of membrane-interacting peptides.23\n",

The major prominent difference is the L107 orientation relative to the other hydrophobic residues: its side chain is facing the opposite direction in relation to the aromatic ring of W101 in the pre- and post-fusion states; the ring lies 11.9 and 11.2 \u00c5 away from the L107 side chain in the two crystallographic structures, but only about 2.4 \u00c5 away in the DPC-bound state, as shown in Fig. 4b and in Table 2. This difference in the orientation of the residue L107 among the three structures might be a consequence of the milieu surrounding the fusion peptide, since it is surrounded by water molecules in the conditions used to crystallize the pre- and post-fusion states of the full-length glycoprotein, whereas it is surrounded by long hydrophobic chains of the DPC detergent molecules in the structure determination in solution by NMR. It may be that the detergent side chains drive thermodynamically the clustering of the hydrophobic triad W101, L107, and F108 present in the DV fusion peptide.

Alternatively, exchange-transfer NOESY is a convenient method to obtain structural information on small molecules in association with high molecular weight receptors such as proteins or biomolecular assemblies like phospholipid vesicles.24 This technique permits the detailed structural analysis of high molecular mass complexes that are not feasible by common NMR methods due to fast relaxation processes that ultimately result in broad lines. The method is particularly useful for structural analysis of proton-rich, flexible ligands that usually have rotational correlation time (\u03c4c) near the value for the NOE null condition (\u03c9\u03bf \u00d7 \u03c4c = 1.12, where \u03c9 is the Larmor frequency) or shorter, which corresponds to a molecular mass of \u223c 5 kDa.24 Exchange-transfer NOESY can be applied to systems in fast exchange on the chemical-shift time scale, that is, in which the dissociation rate, k\noff, is larger than the chemical-shift difference between the free and the bound forms of the ligand,24 so that ligand protons show a single resonance peak averaged over free and bound states. The buildup of the transferred NOEs requires fast exchange between the bound and free states of the ligand, corresponding to a K\nD > \n 10\u2212 6 M for the complex.

Although we have not yet calculated a structure from the NOE data of the fusion peptide in the lipid vesicles yet, structural information could be obtained from both the total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and NOESY spectra. The changes in the DV fusion peptide chemical shifts observed by 1H TOCSY upon its binding to the vesicles were used to map the regions of the peptide that interact most with the bilayer (Fig. 7\na). This result agrees with the number of inter-residue NOEs per proton per residue, since the segments W101\u2013G102 and L107\u2013F108, which gain the most structure upon binding to DPC micelles, are also those that undergo the largest chemical-shift changes upon vesicle binding (Fig. 7b and c). There is excellent agreement between the profiles of the number of NOEs per residue for LUV and micelle interactions. On the other hand, the segment G103\u2013G106 showed the smallest chemical-shift changes, reinforcing the idea that this part of the fusion peptide makes fewer contacts with the rest of the peptide, as already observed in the post-fusion state of the E glycoprotein.8 While a structure was not calculated for the fusion peptide interacting with LUVs, the NOE data validate the use of DPC micelles to mimic the peptide\u2013bilayer interaction, since the interaction pattern is the same in both cases.",

Moreover, no 1H peak broadening was observed when the W101A peptide was incubated with LUVs of either PC only or PC/PG (4:1), strongly suggesting that the replacement of W101 by alanine disrupts the peptide binding to the membrane.

The removal of the 10 to 11 residues flanking the fusion loop in the longer fusion peptide will perturb these interacting residues, both because of the observed increase in flexibility (Fig. 3a) and because of the introduction of the terminal NH3\n+ and COO\u2212 charges in a region usually occupied by apolar residues in the full-length E glycoproteins.

Among the 15 residues of the peptide, 12 are polar and 3 are hydrophobic (W, F, L). Three residues have membrane-anchoring properties (W, R, K) due to their ability to locate at membrane interfaces.28 However, tryptophan is the residue with the greatest tendency to locate at the membrane interface,29 near the carbonyl groups.30 The combined effect of size, rigidity, and aromaticity is the main reason for this positioning.28 These properties of tryptophan residues make them appropriate for stabilizing the interaction of integral membrane proteins with lipid bilayers;31 in some cases, an \u201caromatic belt\u201d is present.28 They may also make crucial contributions to the conformational stability of peptides and proteins,32 making them key players in protein/peptide\u2013membrane interactions.

Intrinsic fluorescence was measured by exciting samples at 280 nm and scanning emission between 300 and 420 nm using a bandwidth of 8 nm for the Hitachi F-4500 or 10 nm for the Varian Cary Eclipse. After addition of the peptide, the system was equilibrated for \u223c \n 5 min before fluorescence was measured. Partition data were extracted from peptide titrations with LUVs according to Eq. (1), based on a Nernst partition formalism22\n(1)I/IW=1+Kp\u03b3L[L]IL/IW1+Kp\u03b3L[L]where [L] is the total phospholipid concentration available for the peptide to interact with, K\np is the Nernst partition constant, and \u03b3\nL is the phospholipids molar volume. I is the global integrated fluorescence intensity of the system, and I\nL and I\nW are the integrated fluorescence intensities the mixture would display if all the peptide was in the lipidic or aqueous phase, respectively. I\nW can be readily obtained from the measurement of I in the absence of lipid; I\nL, however, is a limit value of fluorescence intensity as [L] \n \u2192 \n \u221e and is determined as a system parameter together with K\np.",
