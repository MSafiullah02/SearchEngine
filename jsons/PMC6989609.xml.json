            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection (Zaman 2010). According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, there were 10 million new cases of TB and 1.3 million deaths as a result of TB in 2017. In India, China, and Indonesia, the total number of people with TB accounts for 44% of the cases worldwide. In China, about 889,000 TB cases were reported, accounting for 9% of the cases worldwide (WHO 2018). Therefore, the prevention of TB remains an urgent task. In recent years, the global TB epidemic has declined. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) refers to TB that is resistant to two or more anti-TB drugs, such as rifampicin and isoniazid (Seung et al. 2015). The clinical abuse of anti-TB drugs has led to an increasing number of drug-resistant strains. Moreover, the failure rate of MDR-TB treatment is significantly higher than that at which susceptible bacteria are infected with TB (Ormerod 2005). As such, the development and testing of new drugs are direly needed to enable more timely and effective treatment of MDR-TB.",

LOF plays an important role in inhibiting the activity of the M. tuberculosis gyrase, which severely blocks the replication process of DNA. Therefore, this drug could effectively promote DNA degradation and kill bacteria in a short period time (Collin et al. 2011). The bactericidal activity of this molecule against intracellular and extracellular M. tuberculosis could be more than twice that of ofloxacin (McGregor et al. 2008). In recent years, it has been clinically proposed that LOF can directly inhibit the metabolism of Mycolic acid in mycobacteria (Ghimire et al. 2016). Thus, it plays a therapeutic role in treating TB. In clinical practice, LOF is an ideal anti-TB drug without any cross-resistance in combination with other clinically applied anti-TB drugs (Richeldi et al. 2002). However, evidence of the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF resistance in TB is still insufficient.",

There is evidence that DNA methylation modifications are closely associated with a variety of diseases (Robertson 2005), including tumorigenesis, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, chronic diseases, and blood diseases (Ramos et al. 2011; Saleem et al. 2015; Zhuang et al. 2012). Moreover, previous studies have highlighted occurrence of DNA methylation remodeling in dendritic cells upon infection with M. tuberculosis (Pacis et al. 2019, 2015). In addition, researchers have focused on the relationship between drug resistance and the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) (Madsen et al. 2005; Phunpruch et al. 2013). For example, Phunpruch et al. suggested that the methylation pattern in Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) could be used to understand the resistance toward lincosamides and erythromycin (Phunpruch et al. 2013). Therefore, we speculate that DNA methylation may be closely related to LOF resistance in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain.",

Subsequently, a monoclone was chosen. The monoclonal agglomerate was dispersed and diluted to 1 Mech turbidity using a bacterial ultrasonic dispersion counter. The prepared bacterial solution was inoculated with LJ medium for amplification. This generation of strain was designated as the primary G0. The WHO criteria (Guidelines for surveillance of drug resistance in tuberculosis. WHO Geneva/IUATLD Paris. International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease 1998) for LOF-resistant strains suggested that M. tuberculosis H37Rv strains could survive in a medium containing LOF at 2.0 \u03bcg/mL. Therefore, the G0 strain was further cultured in LJ medium at 37 \u00b0C for 4 weeks with 2.0 \u03bcg/mL LOF (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The drug-resistant strain was named the G1 generation. The same steps were repeated until G4 strains obtained, which satisfied the criteria provided by the WHO. Subsequently, three more generations of the drug-resistant G4 strains and the wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain were cultured under identical conditions (LJ medium at 37 \u00b0C for 4 weeks per generation). LOF-resistant G7 strains and the wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain were designated as the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively.

Ribosomal RNA was removed using an Epicenter Ribo-zero\u2122 rRNA Removal Kit (Epicenter, USA). Linear RNA was fragmented into 180 bp using the ultrasonic method (Covaris M220, USA). After fragmentation and random priming, reverse transcription was carried out using a PrimeScript\u2122 II Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan). An NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae (NEB,USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After the end repair, blunting, and adenylation of 3\u02b9 ends of cDNA fragments, an adaptor was ligated to each cDNA end. Subsequently, size selection (approximately 400 bp) was carried out using an AMPure XP system (Beckman, USA). Then, adaptor-ligated cDNA was amplified with universal PCR primers. The final library products were purified and assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, USA). The clustering of the index-coded sample was performed using a cBot Cluster Generation System (Illumina, USA). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with the 150-bp paired-end sequencing strategy, and the raw data were finally obtained. Subsequently, high-quality reads were obtained after the removal of low-quality reads (sequences containing the linker, > 10% N bases, or > 50% bases with a < 10 mass value). The aligned reads were obtained by mapping high-quality reads in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/166?genome_assembly_id=159857) using HISAT (version 0.1.6, -phred33 -p 3 -x * -known-splicesite-infile *).

The PCR products were purified and recovered with a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) followed by sequencing with Illumina HiSeq2500 with the 150-bp paired-end sequencing strategy. BGI SOAPaligner version 2.01 with two mismatches for successful mapping was used to identify the strand specificity of DNA methylation (Li et al. 2009). CpG loci with significant differences between the two groups in DNA methylation have been identified through surrogate variable analysis (Leek and Storey 2007).",

Therefore, MDR-TB poses a significant threat to public health (Migliori et al. 2010). LOF has been proven effective in treating TB, which has been the subject of clinical trials to improve dosage amounts (Tiberi et al. 2018). According to the results obtained by Ghimire et al., there are several advantages of using LOF to treat MDR-TB. First, the concentration of LOF in tissues, such as sputum, bronchial mucosa, and lung tissue, could exceed that in the blood. Second, LOF could easily kill M. tuberculosis in macrophages. Third, continuous delivery of this drug has no accumulation tendency (Ghimire et al. 2016). Therefore, LOF could be an optimal drug for MDR-TB treatments and thus is in phase II trials (NTC01918397). However, the basic molecular mechanisms of LOF resistance in TB treatment have not been fully demonstrated.",

This result suggests that LOF resistance affects the change of internal regulation networks in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Epigenetic abnormalities provide an alternative mechanism for transcriptional silencing. Therefore, we have focused on genes with downregulated mRNA expressions and upregulated methylation levels in both the LOF-resistant and control groups. Nine genes were identified: pgi (Rv0946c), fadE4 (Rv0231), php (Rv0230c), cyp132 (Rv1394c), pckA (Rv0211), rpmB1 (Rv0105c), pfkB (Rv2029c), acg (Rv2032), and ctpF (Rv1997).",

            "text": "In M. tuberculosis H37Rv, pgi (Rv0946c) encodes a protein belonging to glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which catalyzes the interconversion of d-glucopyranose 6-phosphate and \u03b2-d-fructofuranose 6-phosphate. This process is an essential step of the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. Apart from its enzymatic functions, pgi (Rv0946c) also has a number of other functions, including being an autocrine motility factor (AMF), a neuroleukin (NLK) agent, a serine proteinase inhibitor, and a differentiation and maturation mediator. As in most organisms, pgi (Rv0946c) is essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages (Sassetti et al. 2003). Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated that cyp132 (Rv1394c) plays a crucial role in Rv1395\u2019s regulator function in cytochrome P450 regulation in M. tuberculosis (Recchi et al. 2003). Recchi et al. (2003) suggested that Rv1395 could bind to two adjacent sites located between two divergent genes: a cytochrome P450 gene\u2014cyp132 (Rv1394c) and the Rv1395 gene itself. Rv1395 could induce the expression of the cytochrome P450 gene (cyp132) and repress its own transcription. Previous studies of metabolism in M. tuberculosis suggested that pckA (Rv0211) in M. tuberculosis can be related to anaplerotic and gluconeogenic routes. This suggests that pckA (Rv0211) might be related to the regulation of metabolic adaptations of central metabolism in various environments of M. tuberculosis (Beste et al. 2011; Watanabe et al. 2011). Moreover, as a member of the DOS regulator, the expression of pfkB (Rv2029c) is upregulated in hypoxia conditions and macrophages (Shi et al. 2016). The results of the mutation screening revealed that pfkB (Rv2029c) is not related to M. tuberculosis growth in vitro or in vivo (Phong et al. 2013; Sassetti and Rubin 2003). A previous study revealed that this gene encodes 6-phosphate fructokinase (pfkB), which is involved in the conversion of sugar 1-p into sugar 1,6-P (Phong et al. 2013). Recently, this protein was identified as a potential vaccine candidate (Zvi et al. 2008). Therefore, pfkB (Rv2029c) is potentially essential in vaccine development in M. tuberculosis treatment. Combined with the network of protein\u2013protein interaction, we can also confirm that the hypermethylated genes cyp132 (Rv1394c), pckA (Rv0211), and pfkB (Rv2029c) were essential in M. tuberculosis H37Rv with LOF resistance. The above genes were both enriched in biosynthesis of antibiotics (mtu01130) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (mtu01110) pathways in the LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv group, which could be essential for the future study of M. tuberculosis treatment. In summary, multiple molecular mechanisms could facilitate in understanding the LOF-resistant mechanisms of M. tuberculosis H37Rv when mediated by methylation. Each of the genes identified in this study could be essential for future treatments of MDR-TB.",
