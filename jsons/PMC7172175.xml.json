Tests included rapid antigen assays (n\n = 4369) using either the BinaxNOW Influenza A&B test (BinaxNOW) (Inverness, Waltham, MA) or the 3M Rapid Detection Flu A + B test (3MA + B) (3M Medical Diagnostics, St. Paul, MN); direct immunofluorescence (DFA) (n\n = 3557) using D3 Respiratory Virus Reagents (Diagnostic Hybrids [DHI], Athens, OH); R-Mix viral culture (DHI) (n\n = 3473) and the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) (n\n = 2715) assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada). During the height of a normal respiratory virus season the laboratories generally perform approximately 400 tests a day. The day prior to the outbreak the number of viral tests performed was 214 as the regular influenza season was ending.

Therefore, initially all samples from patients at a high risk for exposure to the novel H1N1 (preparatory school students, their siblings, teachers and persons with recent travel to Mexico), patients admitted to the hospital with flu-like illness, or any out-reach patient with an Influenza A-positive rapid antigen test, DFA and/or R-Mix culture were tested with the RVP assay.",

Samples positive for the matrix gene but negative for seasonal H1 and H3 are considered influenza A unsubtypeable and are potentially a novel strain of influenza A. The research use-only version of the assay also includes the detection of parainfluenza type 4 and the coronaviruses OC43, NL64, 229E and HKU-1.6, 8, 9 Since the RVP assay was able to subtype the influenza A seasonal viruses and detected a broad range of respiratory viruses other than influenza, we made RVP testing broadly available on an immediate basis.",

The 3MA + B test demonstrated better sensitivity for the detection of seasonal influenza A (41.2%) and novel H1N1 (40%) when compared to R-Mix culture (97.1% and 95%, respectively). The increased sensitivity of the 3MA + B assay over the BinaxNOW assay was consistent with a previous study from our laboratory that directly compared the two tests for the detection of seasonal influenza A and influenza B.4 In that study the sensitivity of 3MA + B (70.1%) for the detection of influenza A was significantly greater (p\n \u2264 0.0001) than the sensitivity of BinaxNOW (46.4%). In this study, BinaxNOW demonstrated better PPVs for the detection of all influenza A subtypes combined and for novel H1N1 than did the 3MA + B test due more false positive 3MA + B results (n\n = 8) when testing pediatric NP washes from early in the outbreak. In our previous study the 3MA + B demonstrated a high specificity of 99.8% for the detection of influenza A and a PPV of 93%. There was only one false positive influenza A sample detected. The cause of the false positive results in this study is currently not known, but may be related to the type of sample tested, presence of excessive mucous or blood in the samples. Additional studies from our laboratory and by the manufacturer are underway to determine the root cause of the false positive influenza A results. In addition, an extensive head to head comparison of the BinaxNOW and 3MA + B test is being conducted.",

As demonstrated in our previous study5 and with the additional samples tested for this study, the RVP assay accurately distinguished the seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and the novel H1N1 influenza A subtypes. The ability to subtype the influenza A virus in the same step as the initial identification proved to be exceptionally useful and saved valuable laboratory resources and time by not having to reflex to a second assay or refer to the Department of Health for the identification of patients infected with novel H1N1. In fact, during the height of the outbreak, our laboratory provided RVP testing to other hospitals outside of our health system and also acted as a first line triage for the local, city and state Departments of Health. In addition, due to the comprehensive nature of the RVP test, the laboratory was also able to identify the virus(es) responsible for numerous other respiratory infections not due to influenza A. Finally, the comprehensive nature of the assay will help us to better understand the epidemiology of novel H1N1 infections and the significance of mixed viral infections.",
