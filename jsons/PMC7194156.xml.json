We tested this hypothesis using liver cells carrying the HCV subgenomic replicon or the full\u2010length HCV genome. Transfection of the OAS\u20101 expression plasmid into cells harbouring the HCV subgenomic replicon of the full\u2010length genome (overexpression) resulted in inhibition of HCV, which was consistent with previous reports (30). In our experiments, cells transfected with the G\u2010type OAS\u20101 plasmid showed higher HCV replication compared with the A type. Therefore, patients with the rs3741981 G allele were weaker in suppressing HCV replication compared with those with the A allele. The higher transaminase level might be the clinical evidence. Increased inflammation eventually led to fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver. The rate of fibrosis progression was believed to be higher among patients with higher serum ALT and AST levels, as reported by Ghany et al. (7). Thus, by in vitro and in vivo study, we ratiocinated that G allele carriers had weaker virus clearance, which resulted in more inflammation, and then more fibrosis.",

The result of IFN therapy obtained by Knapp and colleagues is consistent with our study. It is interesting that previous papers reported an increase of OAS\u20101 protein expression in persistent HCV infection but not in exogenous IFN treatment (32, 33). It seems that OAS\u20101, as a component of the innate immune system and an IFN\u2010stimulated gene, is linked to persistent infection but not to the effect of exogenously administered IFN.",

Many statisticians consider that a 0.05 cut\u2010off is inadequate for genetic association studies. They rather recommend a 0.01 cut\u2010off to strengthen the value of the association. Therefore, our conclusion should be weakened to some extent. In fact, many genetic factors had been reported to associate with fibrosis/cirrhosis of the liver. Most reports were on cytokine polymorphisms. Polymorphisms of interleukin\u201010 and tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b2 were reported in many studies to relate to fibrosis (34, 35). The association of the polymorphism of complementary 5 and fibrosis degree was also reported recently (36). Patients with monocyte chemotactic protein\u20101 genotype G/G or G/A were more likely to have advanced fibrosis and severe inflammation in the liver biopsy than those with genotype A/A (37). The polymorphism of other genes such as the angiotensinogen gene has also been reported to be associated with more advanced fibrosis (38). Patients with coagulation factor V Leiden mutation (A560G) were also more likely to progress to cirrhosis (39). In another study on different alleles for the microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene, an important antioxidant enzyme, patients with cirrhosis were more likely to have the slow metabolizer phenotype of this enzyme (40). It seems that many genetic factors can affect the progression of liver disease, involving different aspects of the liver such as immune, metabolism, circulation and so on. Therefore, in the future, many SNPs of a patient might be detected simultaneously in order to have a stronger prediction of the risk of developing significant liver disease.",
