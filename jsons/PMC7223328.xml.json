Clinical manifestations of ASD are primarily attributed to persistently increased pulmonary blood flow and dilated right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) due to volume overload [1]. Despite markedly increased pulmonary blood flow, patients with ASD rarely become symptomatic or develop pulmonary vascular obstructive disease until mid-adulthood [2]. Traditionally, patients have been referred for ASD closure during childhood, before school-age, to prevent later complications [2, 3].",

Occasionally, an isolated ASD may be associated with congestive heart failure in infancy, and the early closure appears to be beneficial [4\u20136]. In addition, patients with underlying pulmonary abnormalities including lung disease related to prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or chronic aspiration may be adversely affected by increased pulmonary blood flow, and some have advocated early ASD closure to improve outcome in these patients [7]. However, the potential for spontaneous closure has led others to recommend conservative medical management even for symptomatic ASD in young children [8\u201310]. The historical concern with high surgical morbidity and mortality among infants with ASD and complex comorbidities [5] may no longer be applicable [7]. There is a lack of clarity regarding the indications for and outcomes after ASD closure in infancy and early childhood.",

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital. Patients with ASD and either a small patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), partially anomalous pulmonary venous connection (in the setting of a sinus venosus ASD), or bicuspid aortic valve without significant hemodynamic abnormalities were included, whereas patients with other major concomitant congenital cardiac anomalies were excluded. Anatomical diagnosis was made primarily by echocardiogram. Inclusion criteria of \u201csymptomatic\u201d patients were based on the following definitions. The respiratory symptoms included: (a) the presence of baseline respiratory distress (tachypnea, retraction, hypoxia, apnea, increased work of breathing, or feeding difficulty); (b) persistent dependency on respiratory support including supplemental oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or positive pressure ventilation; or (c) recurrent respiratory illness requiring hospitalization at least twice a year. The respiratory symptoms were divided into two groups: (1) \u201csevere\u201d (ventilator-dependent) and (2) \u201cmild to moderate\u201d (spontaneous breathing). Failure to thrive was defined as either (a) persistent low weight below 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean value for age without improvement or (b) suboptimal weight gain falling below a standard growth curve (growth charts by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 0 to 36 months: www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/). Pulmonary hypertension was defined as either (a) estimated RV pressure by tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet measurement by echocardiogram exceeding 2/3 of simultaneous systemic pressure, or cardiac catheterization findings of (b) mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) > 25 mmHg, (c) pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) \u2265 3.5 U\u00b7m2, or (d) pulmonary vascular resistance/systemic vascular resistance (Rp/Rs) ratio \u2265 0.3.",

Ten patients underwent preoperative hemodynamic assessment by cardiac catheterization (Table 2). The ratio of total pulmonary blood flow to total systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) was less than 2 in 6 patients and higher than 2 in 4 patients. Six patients were diagnosed as having pulmonary hypertension by cardiac catheterization (MPAP > 25 mmHg, Rp \u2265 3.5 U m2, or Rp/Rs \u2265 0.3). None had a right to left shunt.

Increased pulmonary blood flow as a result of ASD may lead to deleterious effects on those patients with lung diseases related to prematurity, BPD, and recurrent aspiration and may be responsible for significant morbidity and mortality [16]. In our study, 80.6% of patients with respiratory symptoms had resolution after ASD closure (50% in severe cases and 92.9% in mild-to-moderate cases). Four of 5 patients who did not respond to ASD closure were those with advanced pulmonary disease with ongoing complex medical problems (Pts 7, 15, 16, and 21 in Table 5). Three of these 4 patients died (Table 4). Earlier surgery might have been beneficial for those patients with ASD and worsening respiratory status. For clinically complicated patients, the defect is best closed sooner to prevent the development of further pulmonary vascular damage and perhaps may improve their clinical condition [6, 17].",

The incidence of postoperative complications in symptomatic patients in our study (Table 3) is comparable to what has been reported in older asymptomatic patients [28\u201330]. Indeed, some sick infants with progressively worsening respiratory status (Pts 1 and 3 in Table 5) showed compelling clinical improvement after surgical ASD closure without postoperative complications. Due to significant improvement of intensive care management after open heart surgery in sick infants, the benefit of preventing chronic pulmonary complications by surgical ASD closure in young patients with underlying pulmonary abnormalities may prevail over the risk of potential short-term surgical complications when the patients are not clinically improving despite maximum medical treatment and when percutaneous ASD device closure is not indicated.",

Ten patients were former premature infants, 2 were trisomy 21, and one had multiple congenital anomalies. Clinical indications for ASD closure include respiratory symptoms (n = 15), FTT (n = 10), pulmonary hypertension (n = 9), and multiple cerebral infarcts (n = 1). With ASD device closure, improvement of respiratory status, growth, and estimated pulmonary arterial pressure was noted in 60% (9/15), 40% (4/10), and 100% (9/9), respectively, which are essentially similar to the results after surgical ASD closure in this study.

Thirdly, pulmonary hypertension was not strictly defined in this study, and not all patients underwent diagnostic catheterization. Only 6 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension by cardiac catheterization, and 3 patients were diagnosed by echocardiogram only. Improvement of pulmonary hypertension was assessed only by decrease in echocardiographic measurement of estimated RV pressure, not by decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance.

Surgical ASD closure can be performed safely in symptomatic infants and young children with no significant incidence in perioperative morbidity and mortality. We suggest early closure of ASD, either by device or by surgery, in all symptomatic infants and young toddlers with underlying chronic lung disease to mitigate ongoing parenchymal and vascular injury to the lung while enhancing improvement of lung function.",
