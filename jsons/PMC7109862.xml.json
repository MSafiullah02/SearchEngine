The protocol was approved by the research ethics board. Respiratory infections were defined as a documented temperature >138\u00b0C associated with 1 or more of the following clinical symptoms: cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and myalgias. Fifty seven patients were screened, and 50 were enrolled. Five patients were ineligible because of undocumented temperature; 2 refused nasopharyngeal aspiration; 42 completed a follow-up visit.",

Samples were stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 4 days and then shipped to a central laboratory, where they were aliquoted and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until analyses at the end of the study. All respiratory samples were originally tested for influenza A and B virus, RSV, and hMPV using an in-house real-time multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR assay, as described elsewhere [8]. Using aliquots of the original samples that were stored frozen, we now tested for adenoviruses groups A, B, C, and E; rhinovirus A and B; influenza A and B virus; hMPV A and B; RSV A and B; parainfluenzaviruses types 1\u20133; coronaviruses HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43; and enteroviruses A-D by multiplex PCR followed by primer extension and microarray hybridization in an integrated molecular diagnostic device, the INFINITI analyzer (AutoGenomics) [9].

Indeed, wheezing on physical examination was a distinguishing characteristic of hMPV infection.

However, >80% of those patients with hMPV infection received antibiotics despite an absence of radiographic signs of pneumonia, suggesting that the presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms may have reduced the threshold for use of antibiotics.

            "text": "Patients with hMPV infection were actually less immunosuppressed than were those experiencing influenza. Given that wheezing predominated, our findings suggest that viral-mediated inflammation may underpin the clinical symptoms associated with hMPV infection. Indeed, hMPV infection has been associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in both animal models [12] and humans [13]. The incidence of asthma has increased among HIV-infected children and young adults who receive HAART, and it has been speculated that this may be driven by immune reconstitution, because asthma has been associated with higher CD4+ cell counts [14]. Indeed, a large proportion of the patients with hMPV infection in our study were asthmatic. Adult asthmatics have been shown to display exaggerated interferon \u03b3 responses to hMPV and RSV [15]. Thus, the potential link between hMPV and asthma in individuals with HIV infection warrants further exploration. Because all patients with hMPV infection had also received vaccination against influenza, a vaccine that is arguably more effective in individuals with higher CD4+ cell counts, the higher frequency of hMPV could also have been attributable to competing risks of viral infection other than influenza, once it has been effectively prevented.",

Thus, we were unable to determine the etiologic role of respiratory viruses in more-severe disease. Finally, the lack of HIV-uninfected and asymptomatic control groups limits our ability to determine how the detection rates of respiratory pathogens in our study sample differed from those in the general population.",
