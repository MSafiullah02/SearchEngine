The disease rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas worldwide. As of February 29, 2020, Chinese health authorities announced that 79,389 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 2,838 death cases had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions. Of note, in Wuhan, 48,557 COVID-19 cases with 2,169 deaths were confirmed on that same day, suggesting a much higher proportion of severe cases and mortality rate in Wuhan than in other provinces of China. However, all clinical characteristics of the patients suffering from COVID-19 cases were defined only progressively. Identifying and eliminating factors predicting a negative outcome is a key to improving survival from COVID-19.",

This article, published in this issue of Kidney International, is the first study that reported an association between kidney disease (or abnormal kidney function) and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In this cohort, approximately 13% of patients had underlying kidney disease. More than 40% had evidence of abnormal kidney function and 5.1% had acute kidney injury (AKI) during their hospital stay. There was a dosedependent relationship between AKI stages and death, with an excess risk of mortality by at least 4 times among those with stage 3 AKI. Kidney disease is a major complication of COVID-19 and a significant risk factor of death. However, data of this study was originated from a single center, therefore, generalizability of the cohort characteristics could not be confirmed, and only shortterm, catastrophic outcome (death) was discussed. Nonetheless, the study findings suggest that early identification of those at risk, interventions to provide appropriate support, and avoidance of nephrotoxins may help to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "In this large prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches in Wuhan, China, we observed a high prevalence of kidney disease in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. More than 40% of them had evidence of kidney disease, with elevated serum creatinine and BUN values in over 13% of them. Strikingly, the presence of kidney disease was associated with greater in-hospital mortality. Multiple organ involvement including the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney have been reported during the course of SARS in 2003 6 and very recently in patients with COVID-19. 7 One possible explanation of the high prevalence of kidney involvement at hospital admission is that some the patients with COVID-19 had a past history of chronic kidney disease. Such patients have a proinflammatory state with functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 8 and are known to have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 9 and pneumonia. 10 Of note, the median time period between the first symptoms and signs of COVID-19 and hospital admission was slightly more than a week in our study. An alternative explanation is that many patients with COVID-19 could not be admitted in the very early stage of disease outbreak because of the acutely increasing, large number of patients and limited availability of hospital beds in Wuhan. Earlier admission to hospital might have helped to prevent disease spread and deterioration. This is the first study showing an association between kidney involvement and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. We found that patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to undergo mechanical ventilation, suggesting that kidney disease on admission represented a higher risk of deterioration. It has been reported previously that kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and SARS. 5, 11 In our study, e d i t o r i a l : s p e c i a l r e p o r t indicators of kidney involvement at admission were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death even after adjustment for potential confounders. This observation indicated poor prognosis regardless of initial COVID-19 severity and general physical condition. Monitoring kidney function must therefore be emphasized even in patients with mild respiratory symptoms, and altered kidney function should be given particular attention after admission in clinical practice. Early detection and treatment of renal abnormalities, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, may help to improve the vital prognosis of COVID-19. AKI results from an abrupt loss of kidney function and is strongly associated with increased mortality and morbidity. 12 We found that patients with elevated serum creatinine were more likely to develop AKI during hospitalization, which is consistent with study in SARS. 5 It is therefore important to increase the awareness of AKI in those who entered the hospital with an elevated serum creatinine. In our cohort, the detection rate of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 5.1%, which is in keeping with recent reports of small sample size 1,4,7,13 and much higher than the 0.5% of a large observational study. 14 This may be explained by an extremely high proportion of severely sick patients in a previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study. In our cohort study, 42.7% of patients were severely ill, and this may explain the higher detection rate of AKI in clinic practice in Wuhan. Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on acute changes in serum creatinine and the frequency of serum creatinine tests has a substantial impact on detection rate. 15 In a nationwide crosssectional survey of hospitalize adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. 16 After adjusting for the frequency of serum creatinine, determinations of the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults rose to 11.6%. 17 Thus, to improve early detection of kidney injury, more frequent serum creatinine measurements should be performed in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is likely to be multifactorial. First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of polymerase chain reaction fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in both the patients with the 2003 SARS virus 18 and those with COVID-19. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-sequencing data demonstrated tha-tACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2-dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T-cell lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from patients with SARS were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in patients with COVID-19 require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the patients with the 2009 H1N1 virus had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19, who were admitted to an intensive care unit, showed a tendency toward increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.",

We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and reninangiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors treatment on admission. The difference in the use of glucocorticoids may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe, thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoids in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19. 22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including umifenovir, oseltamivir, and lopinavir with ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 24 These potentially harmful effects may account for the low proportion of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors used by physicians in our cohort, especially in patients with AKI who had higher level of creatinine on admission. Due to the small number of patients with AKI and the bias in different therapy of patients with COVID-19, causal relationship between drug and AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains undetermined.",

Third, clinical data of patients after discharge were lacking, so we could not assess COVID-19 effects on long-term outcomes.

In conclusion, the prevalence of kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan, China, was high.

Hazard ratios (HRs) of each variable were obtained using separate proportional hazard Cox models after adjustment for age, sex, disease severity, any comorbidity, and lymphocyte count. The severity was staged based on the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (trial fifth edition) published by the Chinese National Health Commission on February 4, 2020.

Twosample t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for continuous variables and chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables as appropriate. Cumulative rates of inhospital death were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations between kidney disease indicators and in-hospital death were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Cox proportional hazards assumptions were tested with the Schoenfeld residuals. No violations of the Cox proportional hazards assumptions were detected. In full multivariable models, we assessed interactions of kidney disease indicators with age, sex, comorbidities, disease severity, and lymphocyte count (cutoff P < 0.01). None were eligible for retention. Patients with missing value in proteinuria and hematuria (n \u00bc 259) were excluded when assessed the association of those 2 indicators and in-hospital death in Cox proportional hazard model.
