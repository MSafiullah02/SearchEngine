In the present study we aimed to test the hypothesis that both a history of previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. Therefore our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration.

Furthermore, this study has shown that patients previously treated with steroids and/or immunosuppressants presented a less favorable response to the above mentioned protocol since they showed a poorer survival in comparison to those never treated when examined either as unique events or as unique patients, although the statistical significance was reached only in the first analysis. In the case of unique patients the smaller number of patients is probably responsible for not reaching the level of statistical significance. Our findings refer to a population of ever and never treated IPF-AE patients that present similar characteristics in terms of the exacerbation\u2019s severity. The only statistical significant differences (lower TLC in the never treated group and need for mechanical ventilation in the ever treated group) further validate our hypothesis that on the one hand provided a survival benefit in patients with lower lung capacity and on the other hand patients with higher lung capacity and comparable parameters of the exacerbation severity could not be helped by the applied protocol, thus were intubated and subsequently expired. In addition, median overall survival of those ever treated was just 0.43 months with a 17 % 1-year survival while never treated patients showed a 1-year survival of 65 %. Finally, withholding steroids in all survivors of our protocol 83 % of them were still alive 1 year after the exacerbation event.",

Kondoh and coworkers adopted the second hypothesis and treated their patients with high-dose steroids based on the common belief in those times that steroids are able to modify IPF course. Non-specifying any additional treatment and the eventual use of antimicrobials Kondoh and coworkers reported 100 % success rate for IPF AE. Both Kondoh\u2019s hypothesis that DAD upon UIP represents an accelerated phase of IPF and Kondoh\u2019s treatment approach with high dose steroids pulses were adopted by the international community and remain a recommendation on the current guidelines despite the fact that similar results were never reproduced by other investigators handling similar patients [3] and despite the results of the PANTHER trial [5].",

The overall differences in survival as discussed in the results are significant (p = 0.022). In contrast, the reported mortality of IPF-AE in most studies is very high, usually exceeding 50\u201360 % and the 3-month mortality rate following an exacerbation event reaches 60\u201390 % [2, 9\u201311]. Song and coworkers in the largest report yet published, described 90 cases of IPF-AE with a 2.2 months median survival, a 50 % in-hospital mortality and a 60 % 3-month and 73.1 % 1-year mortality [12]. In 2003 Inase and coworkers described 13 IPF-AE patients treated with methylprednisolone and 7 among them with cyclosporin A as well, that had a 1-month and 3-month mortality of 15 % and 46 % respectively; 3 patients were also treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [13]. The same treatment (methylprednisolone, cyclosporin A, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) was used by Sakamoto and coworkers to treat 11 IPF-AE patients with a mean survival of 135 days [14]. Because of the interpretation of data and the use of mean instead of median values it is quite difficult to render these results comparable to the results of other studies. However, Okamoto, in the largest study to describe the effectiveness of methylprednisolone plus cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine A in 28 patients with IPF-AE had a 1-month mortality of 85.7 % [15]. Kondoh and coworkers described 3 UIP patients (among 236 patients undergoing surgical lung biopsy for diffuse lung disease) that developed an IPF-AE and were treated with methylprednisolone pulses, immunosuppressants (2 patients) and antibiotics and presented a 33 % 3-month and 66 % 6-month mortality respectively [16]. Yokoyama described the impact of noninvasive ventilation in IPF-AE and the 11 patients presented were also treated with steroids, antibiotics and some of them with immunosuppressants as well [17]. Median survival was 30 days, and 3-month and 6-month mortality 54.5 % and 70 % respectively. Morawiec and coworkers in 2011 described 11 patients with IPF-AE and 7 with subacute exacerbation treated with steroids and cyclophosphamide that had a 100 % 1-month survival, a 72 % (55 % in the cases of IPF-AE) 3-month, 56 % 6-month and 33 % 1-year survival respectively; 6 patients received antibiotics for a suspected undocumented respiratory infection with positive outcome [18]. Finally, Simon-Blancal and coworkers treated 37 IPF-AE patients with methylprednisolone pulses and methotrexate and described a 27 % in-hospital mortality with a 4.2 months median survival, the highest ever described; 32 patients received broad spectrum antibiotics as well [19]. In many of these studies apart from methodological issues and the small number of patients it is imperative to notice that many or all of the patients received broad spectrum antibiotics. In some studies the use (or not) of antibiotics is not mentioned at all. However, to our opinion it is difficult to understand why in the majority of cases the authors do not consider the use of antibiotics as a treatment for IPF-AE and they do not consider it to be a determinant of outcome even when they use antibiotics, although experts opinion recommend the use of antibiotics in all cases of IPF-AE [20] and this reflects common practice worldwide. In our opinion the use of antibiotics is of cardinal importance to judge IPF-AE studies results and to treat IPF-AE and this is the main reason why it was included as the major therapeutic strategy in our treating protocol [6, 21].",

            "text": "The survival benefit in IPF-AE patients treated with broad spectrum antimicrobials instead of high dose steroids shown in the present study could be attributed to the fact that they militate the role that microbial populations play in the pathogenesis of such a condition. It is common knowledge that IPF is a disease that severely damages the lung and that IPF lung is vulnerable to any hit, even minor, that could cause DAD in the same manner that direct and indirect lung injuries cause ARDS [22]. Combining this vulnerable substrate with steroids or immunosuppressants would substantially increase the chances of microbes to induce an IPF deterioration [1, 23, 24] especially since recently it is shown that human lung microbiome and any changes in its number and composition play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of lung diseases, IPF included [25, 26]. In the present study 40 % of our IPF patients presented deterioration due to an infectious etiology. In the literature it is shown that patients with interstitial pneumonia receiving oral steroids have 16.3 times more chances to be colonized by Pneumocystis jirovecii than patients not receiving steroids and 36 % of IPF patients grow bacteria in BAL fluid in the absence of clear signs of infection, even before immunosuppression [23, 27]. More recently Molyneaux and co-workers described an increased bacterial burden in BAL of IPF patients that even predicts the decline in lung function and the death of these patients [28]. Moreover a thorough review of real life patients diagnosed and treated as IPF-AE, reveals many infective and non-infective complications of steroids [29]. Wootton and coworkers applying array-based detection found evidence of viral infection in 35 % of IPF-AE [30]. All the above findings reinforce our hypothesis that IPF-AE is an ARDS considered so far of \u201cunknown etiology\u201d that could however be easily triggered by the most \u201cusual suspect\u201d named infection, a process that should be fought with priority.",

Of course we are very conscious of the fact that the responsibility of such a scientific opinion that contradicts the official guidelines, although the latter are based on poor evidence, cannot be easily shouldered and that it should be incontestably proved by a prospective properly designed trial examining the role of steroids in the AE-IPF. It is common sense that a single academic center like ours could never support by itself such a trial but needs the scientific, technical and financial support of the international scientific community and of official medical institutions that could conduct a multi-center trial designed and empowered to provide definitive answers to this already long lasting and crucial for IPF patients debate. We are convinced that our proposal reflects not only our view but also the evolving view of other experts that treat IPF-AE patients worldwide [21, 31, 32].",
