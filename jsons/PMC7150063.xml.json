Carnobacterium is frequently a predominating element of the microflora of chilled vacuum or modified atmosphere-packed meat and seafood, as well as dairy products (Groth Laursen et al., 2005). Its genus is currently composed of 11 species that have been isolated mostly from water or sediment and/or cold environments. Among these species, Carnobacterium divergens and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum (formerly Carnobacterium piscicola) are also dominant in meat (beef, pork, and poultry), seafood (fish and shrimps), and dairy (raw milk and cheese) food products (Leisner, Laursen, Pr\u00e9vost, Drider, & Dalgaard, 2007). These two species can act as food spoilage bacteria when an improperly storage is realized, due to their tolerance to freezing temperatures and thawing, or as protective cultures, depending on the strain and food product (Barakat et al., 2000, Paludan-M\u00fcller et al., 1998).",

It helps make reduced-fat cheese with similar characteristics to regular, full-fat cheese. These bacteria are selected because they produce exopolysaccharide that give reduced-fat cheese a similar texture and flavor as regular cheese.

Its name derives from the fact that it was first isolated from chill-stored meats. It is also a spoilage bacterium in vacuum-packaged, cooked meat products as sliced cooked ham. Its significance that it thrives in anaerobic environments with a temperature around 2\u00b0C, thus, it has been known to spoil vacuum-packed meat (Bj\u00f6rkroth, Vandamme, & Korkeala, 1998). Spoilage by L. carnosum produces typical sensory changes, such as souring, gas formation, and/or slime formation, at the stationary phase; and a vacuum-packaged product is usually expected to maintain good sensory quality for at least 3\u20134 weeks. However, due to an increased level of contamination or particularly active spoilage strains, spoilage may occur during the shelf-life period, subjecting to defects aforementioned (Korkeala, Suortti, & M\u00e4kel\u00e4, 1988).",

The heat resistance of the spores is such that pasteurization will not guarantee freedom from the organism (Brown, 2000).

A process fault that allowed C. sporogenes to survive and proliferate may also have been serious enough to allow spores of C. botulinum to survive, germinate, and produce toxin. Therefore, its physiological and genetic similarity to C. botulinum Group I is often used as a surrogate for this organism in demonstrating the effectiveness of food processes (Brown et al., 2012, Diao et al., 2014, Taylor et al., 2013).",

One accustomed to these odors has no difficulty in differentiating pure cultures of this anaerobe from other putrefactive organisms by this means. A marked softening of the meat without evident reduction in bulk is characteristic of C. putrefaciens (Sturges & Drake, 1927).

Increasing in temperature reduces the time of thermal processing since at 61\u00b0C requires 2\u20136 min, whereas 67\u00b0C demands 6\u201317 s to reduce B. abortus counts in milk (Kronenwett, Lear, & Metzger, 1954). Similarly, B. suis could also be destroyed by pasteurization as reported for milk heated at 62\u00b0C for at least 7 min (Park, Graham, Prucha, & Brannon, 1932). The pH value can also influence the development of Brucella spp. since the optimal range of pH is between 6.6 and 7.4, which is close to that observed for milk (pH=6.6\u20136.7). However, in pH values lower than 4.1\u20134.5, the development of these bacteria is inhibited (Falenski et al., 2011). However, the consumption of unpasteurized food increases the risk of brucellosis. The infection in humans mainly occurs by contact or consumption of raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk, and dairy products and raw fish. The occupational exposure is the main cause of transmission in humans in farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, and researchers (Franco, Mulder, Gilman, & Smits, 2007). The clinical manifestations associated with brucellosis are wide: intermittent fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, progressive deterioration in visual function, periorbital pain, and periodic generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and other impacts in hepatobiliary, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and integumentary systems. However, the information available about this disease is limited (Atluri et al., 2011, Franco et al., 2007, Sohn et al., 2003).",

Regarding studies that evaluated Brucella spp. outbreaks, an outbreak in Nigeria in the late 1970s occurred due to the settling of nomadic populations after the local civil war. After this event, improvements were done in intend to reduce future outbreaks but the combination of pastoralist movements and growing demand for food poses the risk of Brucella outbreaks in recent days (Ducrotoy et al., 2014). In Arab countries, the incidence of human brucellosis was reported high in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palestinian Authority, Syria, Jordan, and Oman, where the main species was B. melitensis. In addition, the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products was associated with brucellosis in Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, and Syria (Refai, 2002). Brucellosis is also considered as a travel disease. The occurrence of new cases in regions where this illness is under control is usually traced back to endemic regions along with consumption of contaminated nonpasteurized milk products (Norman, Monge-Maillo, Chamorro-Tojeiro, P\u00e9rez-Molina, & L\u00f3pez-V\u00e9lez, 2016). The occurrence of new cases in areas with low or zero cases of brucellosis can also be associated with gastronomic habits of immigrants as reported for Moroccan immigrants in Spain. All nine cases in this outbreak were caused by consumption of unpasteurized raw milk (Ramos et al., 2008).",

Microbiological assays revealed that this outbreak was caused by C. jejuni and C. coli. ingestion (Edwards et al., 2014). In a restaurant in Liverpool (England), one confirmed case and two probable cases were associated with Campylobacter infection in 2011. Although the microbiological counts of food from the day of infection were not determined due to delay onset and reporting, the most probable infected food were king prawns and chilli sauce. Cross-contamination between raw chicken liver and cooked food was suggested to explain this outbreak (Farmer, Keenan, & Vivancos, 2012). Similarly in Barcelona (Spain), a Campylobacter outbreak was caused by poor food handling hygiene and deficient kitchen facilities. Raw chicken meat contaminated cooked food served to primary school children in canteen that means indicated cross-contamination (direct transfer of bacteria to cooked food). A total of 75 cases were registered in this outbreak (Calciati et al., 2012).",

An outbreak in Pennsylvania, United States in 2011, was caused by consumption of glass-bottled pasteurized milk contaminated with Y. enterocolitica. A total of 22 cases were registered along with one death. The most common symptoms were diarrhea and fever although abdominal cramping, nausea, sore throat, and rash were also reported (Longenberger et al., 2014). Similarly, in Finland an outbreak caused by contaminated raw milk affected 43 people in 2014.

Among all Escherichia species, E. coli is the most relevant due to the health impact associated with ingestion and colonization in human digestive system. E. coli bacteria are considered as worldwide intestinal pathogen with defined phenotypes: diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)/verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) (enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC] is also included in this phenotype) (Cho et al., 2014, Scheutz, 2014). E. coli is present in the intestinal microflora of many farm animals (cattle, sheep, and swine), wild animals (birds and deer), pets (dogs and cats), and humans as commensal bacteria (Bach, McAllister, Veira, Gannon, & Holley, 2002).

It has been isolated from other species such as B. subilis, B. licheniformis, and B. pumilus that have gained great importance due to the type of pathology that they produce (Scheldeman et al., 2006). Diarrheal disease is often associated with protein rich foods (meat, vegetables, puddings, and milk products) and is thought to be caused by vegetative cells (ingested as viable cells or spores) that produce enterotoxins in the small intestine (Abee et al., 2011). The emetic disease is often associated with starch-rich foods (fried and cooked rice, pasta). It was identified for the first time in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, when microorganisms from B. cereus were linked to several outbreaks caused by eating cooked rice. The B. cereus emetic toxin, cereulide, produces the emetic disease that is present in foods before ingestion (Abee et al., 2011).",

According to the Health Protection Agency, the Clostridium genus consists of more than a hundred known species, including harmful pathogens such as C. botulinum, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, C. butyricum, and Clostridium sordellii. The anaerobic status of these bacteria is a strong driver for niche differentiation compared to Bacillales representatives. Besides, they can be differentiated based on their biochemical activities, including saccharolysis and proteolysis. The first four members produce powerful toxins released from vegetating (growing) bacteria, that is, C. botulinum, produces the most powerful toxin known to man, which is the key virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of disease. Its action is the reverse of that of tetanus toxin, that is, it prevents muscle contraction, leading to flaccid paralysis of important muscles. It inhibits the release of acetylcholine at motor nerve endings in the parasympathetic nervous system. This potent toxin is relatively heat-resistant (although destroyed by temperatures >60\u00b0C). C. difficile is found in the feces of 3\u20135% of humans, in the gut of several animals and in the environment. The organism produces at least two potent toxins that are responsible for severe and occasionally fatal diarrhea. C. perfringens produces a number of potent toxins, the most important of which is the a-toxin (phospholipase C), which causes host cell lysis and finally C. tetani produces an extremely potent single toxin (tetanus toxin) which underlies the pathogenesis of tetanus. Tetanus toxin consists of two components, including the neurotoxic \u201ctetanospasmin\u201d and the hemolytic tetanolysin. The toxin prevents muscle relaxation, leading to persistent contraction of facial and body muscles.",

According to several authors (Piggot and Hilbert, 2004, Sonenshein, 2000) sporulation occurs in response to a high cellular density, nutritional limitations, or cellular communication. The resistance of spores is developed during the sporulation. These spores are metabolically dormant and resistant to heat, radiation, desiccation, pH extremes, and toxic chemicals (Setlow, 2000). The dormant spores also monitors the environment around theirs, and when conditions are again favorable (presence of germinants as nutrients such as amino acids, sugars, purine nucleosides, or other agents as lysozyme or salts) for growth, the spore germinates and goes through outgrowth, ultimately being converted back into a growing cell (Paidhungat & Setlow, 2002). The transition from spore to vegetative cell involves three distinct phases: activation, germination, and growth. In Fig. 3.1\n, schematic diagram of the sporulation and cycle of germination of the B. subtilis can be observed.",

Inner and outer spore coats are composed of layers of spore-specific proteins. The cortex is composed of loosely linked peptidoglycan and contains dipicolinic acid, which is particular to all bacterial endospores. This acid cross links with calcium ions embedded in the spore coat and contributes to the extreme resistance capabilities of the endospores because it creates a highly impenetrable barrier.

B. cereus and C. botulinum have been detected worldwide in soil samples (Dodds, 1993) with levels in soil that can reach 105\u2013106 spores/g of soil (Lund, 1986, Te Giffel et al., 1995). The spores ingested with fecal and other soil materials colonize the gut of animals and may develop a symbiotic relation with their hosts (K\u00f6nig, 2006). Besides, soil contamination can transfer to plant material (silage) and to feed. According to Magnusson, Christiansson, and Svensson (2007), the major cause of contamination into foods is related to dispersion of spores by fecal material of warm-blooded animals. Indeed, the microorganism, C. perfringens is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals (including man) (Brynestad & Granum, 2002) and C. botulinum has been identified in cow and pig feces collected in abattoirs (Dahlenborg, Borch, & R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m, 2003). On the other hand, food-processing facilities can be also the source of spores in foods, in fact milking machinery and apparatus have been indicated as sources of milk contamination (Scheldeman, Pil, Herman, Vos, & Heyndrickx, 2005). Specifically, Svensson, Ekelund, Ogura, and Christiansson (2004) have noticed the presence of a persistent B. cereus spore, due to their resistance to cleaning operations because many of them have strong adhering properties and ability to form biofilms (Auger et al., 2009). Overall, it is worthy to say that processed foods are increasingly a mixture of multiple ingredients and additives, each bringing its own spore-forming bacteria into the final food products. Works in the literature clearly demonstrate that the origins of B. cereus spores are very diverse, depending on factors such as the microbial ecology, animal feeding, the farming management, the climate, and the hygienic practices during food processing.",

Physical methods of inactivation of microorganisms are those, based on the use of temperatures and modified pressures with the aim of altering cell structures or essential biomolecules for their metabolism as high-pressures (HPP) and ionizing radiations (ultraviolet and infrared). Regarding the first methodology, Zhang and Mittal (2008) reported successful conditions with HPP for the inactivation of spores of various species. However, these authors affirm that due to the complicate intrinsic and extrinsic factors, HPP conditions should be verified case by case for required sterility. It has been studied that the effect of infrared radiation on the inactivation of spores, due to this radiation is quickly converted to heat, producing an intense local heating on spores (Mamouni, Tang, Wu, Vlahovic, & Yang, 2011). Explanation is based on local heating over the spores produce mechanical abrasion causing the germination by the activation of the lysis enzymes (Dong, Tang, Wu, Vlahovic, & Yang, 2013). These enzymes are present in the spore in an active form, but they do not act until they are activated by the mechanical damage.",

Such processes can generate added value to the product by improving sensorial characteristics of the final product. However, these treatments are not effective in spore elimination. Spores are extremely resistant to a variety of chemicals, including acids, bases, oxidant and alkylating agents, aldehydes and organic solvents. However, treatments with strong acids can eliminate spores, probably due to the rupture of the inner membrane (Setlow, 2006). On the contrary, treatment with a strong alkali is less effective because they can be reactivated with an adequate recovery by lysozymes (Setlow, 2006). Within emerging technologies, we can highlight plasma and advanced process of oxidation based on radical generation. Plasma has been reported to inactivate both vegetative cells and bacterial endospores. Three basic mechanisms have been attributed to the inactivation of spores: (1) DNA degradation by UV radiation, (2) volatilization of compounds of the spore surface by UV photons, and (3) erosion of the spore surface by the adsorption of reactive molecules as free radicals (Philip et al., 2002).",

People acquire trichinosis by consuming raw or undercooked meat infected with the Trichinella parasite, particularly wild game meat or pork. Even tasting very small amounts of undercooked meat during preparation or cooking puts you at risk for infection. Several different species of Trichinella can cause human disease; the most common species is Trichinella spiralis, which has a global distribution and is the species most commonly found in pigs. However, there is an increasing number of reports of Trichinella britovi as a cause of human infection caused by meat from domestic pigs (Gamble et al., 2007, Pozio et al., 2001). Trichinosis is considered a zoonosis because infection occurs after ingestion of raw or poorly cooked meat from infected animals. One to two days after the ingestion of heavily encysted meat, trichinae penetrates the intestinal mucosa, producing nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and sometimes, vomiting. The larvae begin to invade striated muscles about 7\u20139 days after the initial symptoms. About 6 weeks after the initial infection, encystment occurs, accompanied by tissue pain, swelling, and fever (Jay et al., 2005).",

The transmission of this disease occurs when infective larvae are ingested from fish or squid that humans eat raw or undercooked (Sakanari et al., 1988). The noninvasive form of anisakiasis is generally asymptomatic, resulting in tingling throat syndrome when worms are released from seafood following digestion and migrate up the esophagus into the pharynx, where they subsequently may be expectorated (Sakanari & McKerrow, 1989). In the invasive form, worms typically penetrate the mucosa of the stomach or small intestine, resulting in epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, usually 12 h after consumption of the infected seafood (Hayunga, 2007). In some chronic cases, the only treatment is the removal of the larvae via endoscopy or surgery.",

The parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods and makes it very tolerant to chlorine disinfection. While this parasite can be spread in several different ways (as food contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocytes), water (drinking water and recreational water) is the most common way to spread the parasite. Generally, C. parvum infects the border of the intestinal epithelium and causes villous atrophy.

Infections are acquired principally by ingestion of food and water containing oocysts, ingestion of animal tissues containing cystic forms or transplacental transmission (Dubey & Beattie, 1988). The unsporulated oocysts require 24 h outside the host to differentiate and become infectious. When the oocysts are ingested, the sporozoites are released and they invade epithelial cells and rapidly multiply asexually, producing tachyzoites. Choriorentinitis is frequently observed in adults who acquire the infection. Other symptoms as fever with rash, headache, muscle aches, and pain and swelling of the lymph nodes were described (Jay et al., 2005). In immunosuppressed patients, toxoplasmosis could be reactivated from latent infections (Reiter-Owona et al., 2000). Toxoplasmosis can also be acquired by transplacental transmission when a pregnant woman becomes infected. Most infected children do not show any signs of the disease until later in life, when they may present with choriorentinitis and mental retardation (Ades, 1991, Brady-McCreery et al., 2003, De Marco et al., 2003).",

Giardia is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods. Five different species of Giardia have been described (G. muris, G. lambia, G. agilis, G. ardeae, and G. psittaci) (Erlandsen and Bemrick, 1987, Ortega, 2007). Giardia can be observed in the form of trophozoite and the cyst. The cyst is the infectious form and is relatively inert. After cysts are ingested, excystation occurs in duodenum after exposure to the acidic gastric pH and the pancreatic enzymes. The majority of Giardia infections are asymptomatic, but they can present a chronic diarrhea. Symptomatic patients present with loose, foul-smelling stools, and increased levels of fat and mucus in fecal samples. Flatulence, abdominal cramps, bloating, nausea, anorexia, and weight loss are common. Fever is occasionally present at the beginning of the infection (Ortega, 2007).",

Microbiology is important to food safety, production, processing, preservation, and storage. Microbes such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts are employed for the production of foods (wine, beer, bakery products, dairy, etc.) and food ingredients. On the other hand, microbial contamination of food can occur at any point in the food production process: growth, harvesting, transport, storage, or final preparation. In this regard, the microbial growth in foods can also cause visible changes such as change in color, deposition of powdery growth, making it lose its organoleptic characteristics, and effervescences on food surface.",
