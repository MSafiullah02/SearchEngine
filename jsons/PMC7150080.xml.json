Their gentle temperament, commercial availability, low maintenance expense, and extensive historical use as a research model underlie their popularity as research subjects. The guinea pig was the first laboratory animal species derived and maintained in an axenic state (Wagner and Foster, 1976). Guinea pigs have been used in a variety of studies, including anaphylaxis, asthma, delayed hypersensitivity, genetics, gnotobiotics, immunology, infectious disease, nutrition, otology, and pharmacology. They are used also as a source of serum complement in laboratories using the complement-fixation test to diagnose infectious disease.",

Solid-bottom cages may be bedded with commercially available materials such as ground corncobs, hardwood chips, or shavings and paper products. Some bedding materials may interfere in animal test systems involving ascorbic acid depletion because of the presence of low levels of vitamin C in some bedding materials (Dunham et al., 1994). Commercial breeders often use large solid-bottom, plastic tubs with wire-bar or -mesh tops to house breeding groups. These tubs can be stacked vertically on racks.

Vocalization, agonistic displays, and occasional fighting can also be used to define territory. Social interactions consist primarily of following and grouping. Guinea pigs move, rest, and often eat in groups (Manning et al., 1984). In a cage, they will align themselves along the outside perimeter, end to end, with young pups near the end of the line.

Young are delivered quickly, generally at night, with pups being born every 3 to 7 min and completion of parturition in 30 min. The sow cleans the pups and eats the placentas. Boars also will eat placentas. Like female rabbits, sows do not retrieve their young.

Young guinea pigs can survive anoxia for only a few minutes in the isolated uterus. Partially extruded young can be gently pushed or pulled through the tract.

The organism is a short, gram-negative rod or coccobacillus, aerobic, motile, and non-spore-forming, as are all gram-negative bacilli. Growth in vitro is best at 30\u00b0 C but is slow to poor at 37\u00b0 C, with circular, pearlescent colonies minute at 24 hr and maximum at 72 hr. Colonies are embedded in the media and are surrounded variably by a zone of \u03b2-hemolysis (Ganaway, 1976; Boot et al., 1994). Immunologic studies (Wullenweber and Boot, 1994) and macrorestriction digestion of DNA techniques, as well as evidence of phenotypic modulation of surface components, provide evidence for serotypic variation within the species. The organism variably dissociates in culture (isogenic mutation), and these isolates vary in hemolysin, dermonecrotoxin, proteases, adenylate cyclase, and hemagglutinin production, which may affect host specificity, virulence, and disease manifestation (Griffith et al., 1996).",

Dams pass the organism to their young. In acute cases, gross lesions include an acute enteritis and mucosal ulceration with miliary, cream-colored nodules in the intestinal wall. In the subacute to chronic form, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow contain gray-white, ovoid nodules ranging in size from a few millimeters to 2 to 3 cm. Palpation detects enlarged peripheral nodes. Microscopically, the lesions contain dead cells, inflammatory cells, and blood vessels with bacterial emboli. More chronic lesions are granulomas that do not calcify (Obwolo, 1977; Percy and Barthold, 1993). The causative organisms can be seen in and cultured from the lesions, and the enlarged mesenteric nodes can be palpated in guinea pigs.",

Escherichia coli, not a normal intestinal inhabitant in guinea pigs, may proliferate in an antibiotic-caused dysbiosis and cause deaths (Farrar and Kent, 1965). Antibiotics most often implicated are the aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin, streptomycin, and lincomycin. Penicillin at dosages as low as 2000 U or ampicillin at dosages over 6 mg/kg q8 hr for 8 days are known to cause deaths (Lowe et al., 1980; Young et al., 1987). A mechanism for loss of colonization resistance may involve effects on microbial populations, accumulation of excessive carbohydrates and reduced short-chain fatty acids, followed by growth or toxin production of organisms that utilize those metabolites (Clausen, 1998). Clostridium difficile-associated typhlitis occurred also in gnotobiotic guinea pigs exposed to murine intestinal microflora (Boot et al., 1989).",

Probable primary roles of vitamin C are acting as a cofactor in hydroxylation and amidation reactions by transferring electrons to enzymes that provide reducing equivalents (i.e., protons) and scavenging both intracellularly and extracellulary superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen, whose activity results in tissue damage (Chakrabarty et al., 1992).

Young guinea pigs involved in a dystocia experience hypoxia, which is a dangerous condition for newborns.

Guinea pigs are fastidious eaters and do not adapt well to changes in many aspects of their food and water and in how each is presented. Because guinea pigs \u201cimprint\u201d food type (and water taste) early in life, they may not recognize other foods, including powdered diets, water additives, and vegetable supplements. Placing powder in an agar matrix or blending foods during a transition does allow food changes.
