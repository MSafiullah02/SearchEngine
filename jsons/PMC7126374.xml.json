Infectious and noninfectious causes can lead to severe diarrhea in calves. In the first 4 wk of life, infections with bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), Cryptosporidium parvum, and enterotoxic Escherichia coli in particular can cause inflammatory and functional damage to the intestine (Kaske, 1993; Al Mawly et al., 2015). Insufficient management of the diseased calves can quickly result in a fatal outcome (Meganck et al., 2014). A reliable prognostic marker for the progress of diarrhea would enable dairy farmers and veterinarians to monitor critical patients more closely.",

The helical 208-AA glycoprotein IL-6 is produced by several cell types and mainly operates as an inducer of the acute phase response (Droogmans et al., 1992; Barton, 1997). Therefore, it is upregulated in the early stage of an inflammatory process and rapidly decreases after 12 to 24 h (Okabe et al., 1996; Volante et al., 2004). Thus, IL-6 could serve as an early marker for inflammation because serum titers increase before the inflammation becomes clinically apparent.",

Interleukin-6 was prognostic for sepsis and mortality in adult humans suffering from a bacterial infection, regardless of what pathogen was causatively involved (Moscovitz et al., 1994). This was confirmed by another study among severely infected humans at an emergency department, where nonsurvivors had higher IL-6 serum concentrations at the initial examination than survivors (Wilhelm et al., 2012). In hospitalized human neonates, an increased IL-6 serum level was proven 100% sensitive in detecting individuals who developed a clinical sepsis at later stages of their disease (Buck et al., 1994). In veterinary medicine, IL-6 was also a reliable parameter to monitor dogs in intensive care units (Sch\u00fcttler and Neumann, 2015). The mean IL-6 concentration of these dogs was significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group compared with survivors.",

Other investigators focused on the IL-6 serum values in pregnant cows prepartum (Ishikawa et al., 2004). They found high IL-6 serum concentrations in those cows that developed endometritis postpartum. In the case of coliform mastitis, serum IL-6 was shown to be significantly higher in nonsurvivors when sampled at d 0 to 9 of the onset of clinical symptoms (Nakajima et al., 1997).",

The colostrum came from the farm\u2019s colostrum bank and was controlled for sufficient quality with a colostrometer.

The newborn calves were sheltered outdoors in igloos individually and were fed pasteurized waste milk ad libitum in the first week after birth.

Color development was stopped with stop solution (H2SO4) and optical densities were measured in all wells at 450 nm in the Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland). For data analysis, average optical densities were calculated and blank reduction was performed. Standard curves were generated and sample concentrations were determined using the CurveExpert 1.4 software (CurveExpert, Daniel G. Hyams, Hixson, TN; https://www.curveexpert.net/). A detection limit of 1.56 pg of IL-6/mL was reported by the kit manufacturer. The coefficient of variation for the intra-assay test precision was <7%.",

Therefore, they were divided into recovering and nonrecovering groups after collection of data. At the onset of diarrhea, IL-6 was significantly greater in recovering and nonrecovering animals. Because calf age differed between the 2 groups, age was evaluated additionally. In a multivariate logistic regression model none of the variables IL-6 and age and showed significance. A possible interaction between these 2 variables was not observed. However, the univariate logistic regression model for IL-6 showed a significance influence of this variable in predicting a prolonged course of diarrhea and was therefore regarded as the most reliable model in this investigation. The odds to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea increase by 14% for each unit of IL-6 and model could explain 34% of the variance. In literature, several other factors are discussed that increase the risk for diarrhea (Pare et al., 1993; Wiest and Klee, 1998; Bendali et al., 1999). Birth weight and calf housing (e.g., open barn vs. closed barn) were identified as potential risk factors (Pare et al., 1993; Al Mawly et al., 2015), whereas IgG serum concentrations seemed to have no effect (Pare et al., 1993\n; Meganck et al., 2015). These parameters were not assessed in the study presented here, but could have been different in recovering and nonrecovering calves. Therefore, these parameters should be taken into consideration in future investigations, especially focusing on potential interactions between these parameters and IL-6.",

The AUC was used to measure the accuracy of IL-6 in distinguishing recovering from nonrecovering animals. A value of 1 was regarded as a perfect test, whereas a value of 0.5 corresponds to random chance. The AUC value of 0.808 confirmed IL-6 as a good test for the estimation of the prognosis. Furthermore, the ROC analysis allowed the definition of a cut-off value. For the establishment of IL-6 as a prognostic marker, the sensitivity was given priority over the specificity, as a high number of false positive classifications are less important than a high number of false negative classifications. In practice, this means that it is better to monitor a calf more closely that is misclassified as nonrecovering than to overlook a calf that is prone to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea. The cut-off was set at 38.7 pg/mL, with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity 82%, as this was the concentration with the most appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity.",

It is recommended that scouring calves displaying IL-6 values above 38.7 pg/mL should be given special attention, as they were prone to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea. These results underline the prognostic potential of IL-6, which was already shown for adult cattle in cases of postpartal endometritis and coliform mastitis (Nakajima et al., 1997; Ishikawa et al., 2004). Therefore, IL-6 seems highly valuable to forecast complications and possibly life-threatening progression of an infectious disease in cattle.",

Elevated IL-6 values may lead the veterinarian to the decision to monitor scouring calves more closely and to adapt the therapeutic strategy accordingly. Thereby animal suffering and economic losses could be avoided. As the animals in our study only showed infections with BRV or Cryptosporidium parvum, further investigations are needed into all relevant pathogens for neonatal calf diarrhea [e.g., BCV, enterotoxic E. coli encoding F5 (K99) fimbriae].",
