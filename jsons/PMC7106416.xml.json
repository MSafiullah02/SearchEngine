Participants and host and home communities face health risks that are of international concern. Therefore, the control of infectious diseases and provision of medical services for non-communicable diseases and other risks to health are increasingly important in the planning for MGs. Risks commonly associated with MGs include health systems having to accommodate a surge in capacity; challenges to existing health interventions; introduction and transmission of non-endemic diseases during and after MGs; difficulties associated with risk communication to participants from different cultures; and those arising because of the high profile of some events, such as security risks.",

Although a research agenda based on public health must be underpinned by basic science, applied science and operational research are areas of particular interest to the organisers of MGs and the decision makers for public health, especially those in poorly resourced countries.

Continuous monitoring of participants' vulnerability to health risks at MGs and understanding trends in risks that are associated with specific events (religious, sports, or concerts) can be used to predict what might happen in the future. They are also essential for successful preparedness and management of risk reduction and strengthening the response capacity of host and home communities. Recognition and analysis of the changing risks and vulnerabilities during MGs are starting points for raising awareness and communication of pending risks. Building global capacity for health intelligence for non-communicable and infectious diseases is important for the elucidation of the risks associated with MGs. Most of this information is available through networks such as the emerging infectious disease networks19, 20 and the WHO Global Noncommunicable Disease Network.21 Importantly, the information can be used to implement strategies for risk assessment and mitigation in planning for specific MGs (Panel 1, Panel 2\n).Panel 1Agenda for public health emergencies\nDevelopment of integrated global health information capability\nGlobal clinical and laboratory surveillance systems for communicable diseases, such as those for seasonal and pandemic influenza,22 are well established. The establishment of country-level surveillance systems for infectious diseases that can be adapted to different epidemiological settings for mass gatherings (MGs) could also provide alerts for the occurrence of non-communicable diseases, such as radiation-related or chemical-related illnesses or those caused by extreme environmental temperatures (eg, Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases).23 An important component of the alert and response strategy is an integrated event management system that provides a platform for rapid dissemination of devices and procedures required for the management of health risks. Research into their development and implementation is needed. Syndromic surveillance can potentially provide rapid initial information about the occurrence of both non-communicable and infectious diseases. However, its establishment and assessment of effectiveness during MGs might require further assessment. Further work is also needed to identify appropriate parameters for assessment of the effectiveness of such surveillance systems during MGs.\nEnhancement of surveillance activities\nSurveillance of non-communicable diseases is a formidable but necessary step for the improvement of the health of the global community. An estimated 63% of global mortality in 2008 was attributable to non-communicable diseases and 80% of such deaths occurred in low-income and middle-income countries.24 Age-specific and sex-specific profiles of non-communicable diseases by country25 allow host countries of MGs to estimate possible risks of non-communicable diseases in participants from specific countries and plan for mitigation strategies.Although the challenges for the organisers of MGs and the effects of infectious diseases at such events have been summarised,6, 14 there are many gaps in our understanding of emerging communicable diseases. Integration of information from local and international surveillance of infectious diseases is important for strengthening the intelligence about the global threats before, during, and after MGs.23\n\nAssessment of risk\nThe risks of non-communicable and infectious diseases during MGs are proportional to the probability of occurrence of risk factors during the event. The identification of these risks factors for the different types of MGs will provide a scientific basis for planning effective prevention. Although major risk factors associated with non-communicable and communicable diseases are likely to be similar worldwide, factors specific to the type of MG might lead to health problems. Systematic risk assessment helps identify potential risks of outbreaks and guides the establishment of effective risk management solutions. Systematic assessment will also identify potential or deliberate health security risks that require assistance from other authorities and government agencies.The leading causes of morbidity and mortality during the Hajj are heat-related illnesses and trauma-related injuries. Identification of such risks allowed event planners to instigate preventive measures and rapid response strategies. Provision of shaded areas can reduce the incidence of heat-related illnesses and effective crowd control reduces the risk of a stampede. Drug and alcohol use were identified as health risks for other types of MGs;26 therefore, restriction of their use can mitigate the associated illnesses. The types and magnitude of health risks associated with spontaneous MGs due to natural disasters and conflicts are different from those of organised MGs. Objectives for risk management at such events are focused on facility-based health-care provision in addition to prevention.The potential for importation and subsequent global spread of infectious diseases during MGs are well understood. Many emerging human infections are recognised as zoonotic diseases (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], influenza A H5N1, Nipah virus infection). The emergence of novel or rare pathogens in home communities and their subsequent spread to the host community and beyond can be amplified during MGs.\nPlanning for MGs and public health legacy development\nPlanning for the potential risks and hazards that are associated with MGs is essential to ensure success. Many reports and manuals are available for planning MGs;1, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 however, their use should be tempered by the results of the risk assessment. Importantly, planning should maximise the legacy of the MG. The conceptual model of a lasting public health legacy as a framework for the relation between planning inputs, implementation, and public health outcomes was put forward by WHO and the International Olympic Committee to ensure sustainable, positive health effects for the host communities after the Olympic Games.11 Legacy planning should also include passing the knowledge gained to future hosts of similar MGs.Panel 2Research topics for public health emergencies\nIntegrated global health information capability\n\n\u2022Assessment of syndromic surveillance for mass gatherings (MGs) and its applicability in early alert and response systems\u2022Development of methods to integrate global surveillance intelligence for non-communicable and infectious diseases into the planning for MGs\u2022Development and implementation of event management systems that integrate information for global surveillance and allow immediate mitigation of non-communicable and infectious diseases\n\nEnhancement of surveillance activities\n\n\u2022Continued assessment of population trends of non-communicable diseases related to MGs, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries\u2022Investigate environmental, host (intermediate hosts and people), and pathogen-specific factors with the potential to spread (eg, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity) communicable diseases, particularly in relation to MGs\u2022Promote a multidisciplinary approach for the establishment and integration of effective surveillance systems for existing and emerging infectious diseases in relation to home and host populations during MGs\u2022Develop clinical and laboratory algorithms for differential diagnosis of infectious diseases caused by rare and emerging pathogens to aid surveillance and alert efforts\u2022Operational research to establish social, political, economic, and legal strategies for reporting infectious diseases (eg, International Health Regulations)\n\nAssessment of risk\n\nNon-communicable diseases\n\n\u2022Development of standardised terms and definitions for the description of health risks associated with non-communicable diseases that are specific to MGs\u2022Research and promote the development of multidisciplinary and integrated risk assessment systems (eg, environmental factors, transport patterns, crowd psychology, and availability of health services) for existing and perceived health issues related to the specific type of MG for host and home communities\n\nInfectious diseases\n\n\u2022Development of methods for risk assessment in association with global surveillance for mapping indigenous versus potentially imported infectious pathogens\u2022Develop criteria for proceeding with, restricting, modifying, postponing, or cancelling the event based on a thorough risk assessment\u2022Investigate human behavioural factors associated with acquiring infections (including zoonosis) and spread during MGs\u2022Identification of genetic or other factors related to human susceptibility to infection with emerging pathogens\u2022Potential modes of transmission of infections with emerging pathogens among people at the MG\n\nPlanning for MGs and public health legacy development\n\n\u2022Share experience gained from various types of MGs\u2022Develop criteria for measuring legacy and long-term successes for different types of MGs\u2022Analyse long-term effects of legacies of global health and security\n",

Improvements to vaccines and formulations that can provide longer-lasting and broader activity afford better protection, increase the applicability of vaccines, and reduce the frequency of vaccination. During an outbreak, the important factors are the rapid production and equitable distribution of vaccines to countries in need.",

The specific challenge is to provide clear, credible, and appropriate communication to meet the needs of diverse communities and retain public trust in a dynamic yet unknown process.51, 52 Some of the main research topics in this specialty include the link between communication and behaviour change models; development and assessment of methods that can be quickly accessed and used in MGs; and assessment of best practices, challenges, and barriers in risk communication from previous examples (eg, the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic).53\n",
