According to the principle of air cleaning technology, the performance with larger air change rate is better. This has been proved and no further experimental verification is needed. For example, it is of no use to prove that the performance with the air change rate 12 h\u22121 is better than that with 10 h\u22121, or the performance with 10 h\u22121 is better than that with 8 h\u22121. But the relationship is not completely linear proportional. It does not mean that better performance will be obtained when the air change rate increases too much. There is an economic problem.",

It is obviously infeasible. The safety limit outside the biosafety cabinet is determined under the condition that operator is standing in front of a biosafety cabinet with the isolation effect. But the bioaerosol in the isolation ward disperses in the whole room. Therefore, it is difficult to provide the requirement in the isolation ward.

The corresponding maximum penetration particulate size is equivalent with 0.075 \u03bcm.

From the aspect of most stringent requirement, there was no bioaerosol inhaled.

When special treatment is needed, it may take more than 1 h. In this case, it can be assumed 1.5 h.According to Chinese standard on medical masks, the requirement for the efficiency 95% is under the flow rate 85L/min. We know that the common respiratory flow rate is between 8L/min and 80L/min. It is a much safer consideration for the standard to set such flow rate.When the flow rate of respiratory air is 85L/min, in the inhaled air within 1.5 h, the concentration of particles with diameter 0.075 \u03bcm will not be larger than 1/(90 \u00d7 85) = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc/L. Therefore, when the efficiency of mask reaches 95%, the concentration of particles with diameter 0.075 \u03bcm should not exceed 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc/L.Standard for droplet nuclei with diameter 0.075 \u03bcmFrom Fig. 10.1007/978-981-10-2923-3_1, it is known that the number of airborne droplet with diameter 10 \u03bcm is the most. From the Sect. 5.3.2, the diameter of the airborne nuclei is 1.6 \u03bcm.The concentration of particles with diameter 1.6 \u03bcm in the inhaled air should not exceed 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc/L.When the N95 mask is worn, the efficiency for 1.6 \u03bcm is larger than that for 0.075 \u03bcm by three orders of magnitude. Suppose the efficiency is 99.998% (please refer to Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-2923-3_3), the concentration of particles with diameter 1.6 \u03bcm in the inhaled air should not exceed 6.5pc/L.Standard for ordinary microbes indoorsWhen particles are captured by masks, the microbial particles are filtered. For the isolation ward where air is supplied through HEPA filter, the particle concentration is based on the diameter \u2265 0.5 \u03bcm. From Table 5.4, the efficiency of N95 mask for particles with diameter 0.3 \u03bcm can be 99.12%. So the calculated efficiency for diameter \u2265 0.5 \u03bcm is 99.97% [12].The concentration of particles with diameter \u2265 0.5 \u03bcm in the inhaled air should not exceed 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc/L. So the concentration of particles with diameter \u2265 0.5 \u03bcm indoors should not exceed 0.433pc/L.\nFrom the environmentFrom the environment, there should be no bioaerosol released from the isolation ward. For Three-Room-One-Buffer scheme, i.e., the ward-buffer-exterior or corridor, the final bacterial concentration, i.e., the inhaled bacteria during occupancy period which enters into the exterior room should be less than 1pc. The period for passing through the exterior room is short. There is ventilation in the exterior room. The decayed concentration in 1 min will be more than a half. So the concentration within the first 1 min is considered.\n",
