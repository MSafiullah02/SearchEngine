            "text": "Stall rest is prescribed for many horses following orthopaedic injuries, surgeries and severe illness. Some horses do not tolerate confinement well, due to temperament issues, separation or situational anxiety or a lack of acclimation. These horses may walk incessantly, weave, crib, rear, buck or kick the stall walls. These behaviour problems may contribute to delayed wound healing, new injury, recrudescence of illness, as well as damage to the stall and distress for owners. Management techniques such as environmental or social enrichment and free choice access to feed are often attempted, but may not be successful or appropriate for all cases. Herbal and supplemental calming products are available, using various amino acids as well as magnesium for effect; however, there is little scientific data available to judge these products and they are not always effective. If environmental enrichment and supplemental calming agents do not work, medications are often tried. Of these, the most commonly used agents are acepromazine, fluphenazine and reserpine, all of which carry an unacceptable risk of adverse events. The adverse effects ascribed to these drugs make it necessary to find a safer alternative for management of stall rest.",

            "text": "Trazodone hydrochloride is a triazolopyridine derivative and member of the phenylpiperazine class of drugs. It is classified as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor based on its primary pharmacologic mechanism of action to antagonize serotonin 2A receptors and its secondary mechanism to inhibit serotonin reuptake (Stahl, 2013). Trazodone and its active metabolite, m\u2010chlorophenylpiperazine (m\u2010CPP), also have agonistic effects at serotonin 1 receptors (Odagaki, Toyoshima, & Yamauchi, 2005). Trazodone has been used extensively in small animal medicine as an anxiolytic, with or without other behaviour modifying drugs (Gruen & Sherman, 2008; Orlando, Case, Thomson, Griffith, & Sherman, 2016; Stevens et al., 2016). The successful use of this drug in other veterinary species makes it an attractive alternative for use in horses, and worthy of study in this species, as a reduction in anxiety in stall\u2010rested horses will improve animal welfare.",

A minimum 2\u2010week washout period was allowed between administrations. To administer the drug, the dose was divided into two 60\u2010ml catheter tip syringes and the tablets were dissolved in 40 cc of warm water for 5 min. Light corn syrup (15 ml) was then added to increase viscosity and palatability. The resulting suspension was then administered orally through the interdental space and the horse's head elevated for 1 min to ensure administration of the entire dose. Oral administration was achieved within 15 min after tablet contents were mixed with corn syrup.",

Calibration curves were prepared daily by fortifying blank equine plasma with stock solutions of trazodone and m\u2010CPP (Sigma\u2010Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 1 mg/ml each, then further diluted in a solution of 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and 50% double distilled water (ddH2O). Plasma samples and standards were prepared identically by placing 200 \u03bcl of plasma into a glass tube and adding 200 \u03bcl of 2% ammonium hydroxide in water and vortexing for 10 s. The sample or standard was then transferred to a 1 ml supported liquid extraction cartridge (Isolute SLE+; Biotage, LLC, Charlotte, NC, USA) attached to a vacuum manifold. A short period of vacuum was applied to initiate absorption, and then, the cartridges were allowed to sit for 5 min. Next, 2.5 ml of methyl tert\u2010butyl ether was applied to the cartridge and allowed to sit for 5 min without vacuum followed by light vacuum for 2 min. This process was repeated and the vacuum was applied until complete elution of the sample. The eluate was then evaporated under a stream of compressed nitrogen for 15 min at 45\u00b0C. The samples and standards were then reconstituted using 200 \u03bcl of 50/50 ACN:ddH2O (v/v). From this point, the samples and standards were further diluted accordingly to produce concentrations within a high and low concentration standard curve. The high concentration standard curve was prepared by adding 5 \u03bcl sample to 400 \u03bcl 50/50 ACN:ddH2O (v/v) and was used for concentrations of trazodone between 0.01 and 10 \u03bcg/ml. The low concentration standard curve was prepared by adding 100 \u03bcl sample to 250 \u03bcl 50/50 ACN:ddH2O (v/v) and was used for concentrations of trazodone and m\u2010CPP between 0.001 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml. The two standard curves were used to accommodate the wide range of concentrations in the samples, the low concentrations of the metabolite and to increase the sensitivity of the assay.",

Oversedation, defined as either a sedation or ataxia score of 3/3 accompanied by a refusal to eat, was the most common adverse effect noted and was seen in three horses (horses A, B and D) at the 10 mg/kg dose, but none in the 7.5 mg/kg dose. Transient arrhythmias were detected in two horses (horses E and F) in the 10 mg/kg dose, one at 1\u2010hr postdosing and one at 36\u2010hr postdosing. Electrocardiogram readings were not performed; however, based on auscultation, sinus arrhythmias or ventricular premature contractions were considered. The abnormal rhythm detected had resolved within 10 min of initial diagnosis. One of these horses also showed muscle fasciculations concurrent with the arrhythmia. No horses had arrhythmias detected in the 7.5 mg/kg dose. One horse (horse B) developed signs of colic, fever and soft manure 32 hr after administration of the 10 mg/kg dose. Samples from this horse were available for 36 hr after drug administration; therefore, all data were included in the study. Complete blood count, palpation per rectum and abdominal ultrasound were within normal limits. Faecal float for sand, McMaster's egg count and PCR for equine coronavirus, Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, Lawsonia intracellularis, Neorickettsia risticii and Salmonella spp. were negative. Medical management with intravenous and enteral fluids and flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg i.v q12 h for three doses) resulted in resolution of clinical signs within 24 hr. During the 7.5 mg/kg dose study, horse B also developed soft manure that persisted for the first 24 hr of sampling. This same horse had one other documented episode of colic during the washout period between crossover dosing.",

At 12 hr after drug administration, diffuse lesions characterized by pruritus, excoriations, oozing and crusting were noted on the head, neck, chest and forelimbs, which necessitated removing the horse from the study. The horse pulled its catheter and no samples were available after 8 hr, because the skin at the catheter site and over other accessible veins was too inflamed for safe venipuncture. For this reason, data from this horse for the 7.5 mg/kg dose group were not used in the mean calculations for \u03bbz or t\u00bd\u03bb. Biopsy of the affected skin revealed eosinophilic perivascular dermatitis, with oedema and epidermal spongiosis consistent with acute allergic reaction.

All horses were being stall rested for treatment of various diseases, including 12 orthopaedic cases, two post\u2010op colic cases, two ophthalmic cases, one behavioural issue and one tooth root abscess. Horses were placed on trazodone for a variety of adverse behaviours including owner identified anxiety, stall walking, circling, pacing, weaving, kicking stall walls, rearing and violent behaviour.

Intravenous dosing was not performed due to the unacceptable level of adverse effects noted in dogs and horses, including tachycardia, aggression/excitation and whole body tremors (Jay et al., 2013; Knych et al., 2017). This, in addition to the lack of a commercially available injectable formulation, makes intravenous dosing unlikely to be clinically relevant.

A previous study reports an AUC of 8.09 \u03bcg*hr/ml at 4 mg/kg orally (Knych et al., 2017). This AUC is in between the AUCs reported here for 7.5 and 10 mg/kg (means of 5.77 and 11.42 \u03bcg*hr/ml, respectively). This discrepancy may represent differences in absorption of the drug based on the formulation and method of administration. The present study used commercially available trazodone tablets administered via syringe, whereas the previous study used a trazodone powder administered in feed. Differences in absorption profiles of these to formulations are supported by the differences noted in T\nmax reported. Use of the tablets resulted in a mean T\nmax of 0.37\u20130.42 hr, whereas administration of the powdered form in feed resulted in a T\nmax of approximately 1.7 hr.

The lack of significance for the C\nmax is likely due to the small number of animals used as well as the method of administration used in this study. Oral administration instead of intragastric administration was used to more closely mimic treatment in clinical patients. Despite best practices being used to deliver oral medication, a small amount of drug was lost during delivery. This may have contributed to the variability noted in C\nmax. An additional factor that may contribute to variability is the lack of fasting prior to drug administration. This was again done to more closely mimic treatment in clinical patients, as horses on stall rest are frequently fed free choice hay in order to keep them occupied throughout the day. For this study, horses were fed two flakes of hay at 10 p.m. on the night prior to dosing and allowed to eat up to 1 hr prior to dosing. Some horses finished all feed, while others still had hay left at the time feed was pulled. Therefore, the amount of feed in the stomach may have affected the rate or extent that the drug reached the small intestine and was available for absorption (Baggot, 1992). In humans, absorption of trazodone was irregular in fasting subjects and improved after food intake, but the C\nmax concentrations were lower and the T\nmax was increased with feeding (Nilsen & Dale, 1992). However, due to the differences in diet between humans and horses, the actual effects of feeding may differ. The effects of feeding on drug absorption remain to be investigated.",

The duration of ataxia ranged between 2\u20136 and 4\u201312 hr for the 10 and 7.5 mg/kg dose, respectively. The longer duration of ataxia reported compared to sedation for the 10 mg/kg dose is due to one horse having an ataxia score of 1 at the 8\u2010 and 12\u2010hr time point. All other horses had returned to an ataxia score of 0 by 6 hr after administration. The degree to which sedation and ataxia was produced was highly variable among horses.

Clinically significant changes were not noted in relation to heart rate, respiratory rate and gut sounds. Significant changes were noted in relation to body temperature, particularly in the 10 mg/kg dose group. The body temperature was significantly decreased at multiple time points following administration of trazodone. This phenomenon has been previously reported in horses (Knych et al., 2017). The cause is unknown; however, it may be due to the sedative effects of the drug resulting in decreased anal tone and potential pneumorectum. Trazodone has been shown to affect the core body temperature in humans, resulting in a tendency to advance the appearance time of the minimal temperature based on daily temperature rhythms compared to placebo and this effect is related to the development of slow wave sleep (Suzuki , Yamadera, Nakamura, & Endo, 2002; Yamadera, Suzuki, Nakamura, & Endo, 1999). Conversely, trazodone has also been associated with hyperthermia in humans that develop neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome, although this typically only occurs with administration of multiple medications, including other serotonergic drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antipsychotics or dopamine antagonists (Sokoro, Zivot, & Ariano, 2011).

These effects are most commonly noted in people with pre\u2010existing causes of ventricular irritability; therefore, the use of this drug in horses with pre\u2010existing cardiac disease or other drugs that may prolong the QT interval should be performed with caution.

Horses still required additional sedation for prolonged or painful procedures. Due to the retrospective nature of this aspect of the study, the duration of action was not specifically available. One horse, the stallion, did not respond at all. Dosing this horse was difficult due to extreme agitation, and it is estimated that only 50%\u201360% of the dose was successfully delivered orally. Repeat or higher doses were not attempted due to the reported association between trazodone administration and priapism in human (Warner, Peabody, Whiteford, & Hollister, 1987). Although this patient showed no signs of priapism, given the fact that he was a stallion used for breeding, the risk of further treatment based on the potential for effect was considered too high by the attending clinicians and owner. Four horses were determined to be over\u2010sedated by initial doses of trazodone administered. The most common reason for clinicians to determine that a decrease in dose was necessary was not eating for 1\u20132 hr after drug administration. Three of these horses received a decrease in dose of 25% while one horse was maintained on the initial dose. Two horses developed an apparent tolerance to the drug. One horse was initially administered trazodone 10 mg/kg p.o. once daily and the drug lost effect after 14 days so the horse was switched to alpha\u2010casozepine with good effect. Another horse received an initial dose of 10 mg/kg p.o. once daily, which produced oversedation. The dose was then decreased to 7.5 mg/kg and was effective for a period of approximately 3 weeks. After that time, the dose was increased to approximately 9 mg/kg and was effective, but only for a short duration (approximately 6 hr). Development of tolerance to trazodone has been reported in other species, notably dogs. In a clinical trial of trazodone for postsurgical confinement in dogs, 29.7% of owners requested an increased dosage during treatment, starting 2 weeks following surgery (Gruen, Roe, Griffith, Hamilton, & Sherman, 2014).",
