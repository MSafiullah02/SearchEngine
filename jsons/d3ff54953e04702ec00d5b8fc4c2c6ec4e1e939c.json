In a sense, these findings are not surprising. It is now widely thought that MS is the result of an immunologically mediated, quite possibly autoimmune, process. Susceptibility to MS seems to be determined, in part, by the genes that encode elements of the trimolecular complex involved in recognition by T cells. These include the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), certain T-cell receptor peptide sequence polymorphisms and encephalitogenic peptides of brain protein antigens; also implicated are genes governing elements of the immunologically determined inflammatory process. The high concordance of MS in monozygotic twin pairs and in first-degree relatives of individuals with MS, cited by Ebers et al. ' , is an expression of these genetic influences.",

But the image shown here is not a snippet from the head of some Titian beauty. Instead, the arching, twisted loops are an X-ray telescope's view of the solar corona, where the gas -fiery indeed -is at a temperature of several million kelvin. How the gas is heated to this extent was the question exercising James Klimchuk and Lisa Porter, whose research is reported on page 131 of this issue and in a paper to appear in the Astrophysical Journal. From observations of long-lived coronal loops made with the soft X-ray telescope aboard the Japanese Yohkoh satellite (the name means 'sunlight'), they have determined the temperatures and densities of individual loops, and from this derived a scaling law for loop length with gas pressure. The various theories for the mechanism of coronal heating make different predictions for what this scaling law should be, soan unusual feat in this area of research -Klimchuk and Porter have supplied an observational means of discriminating between rival theories. To untangle the tale further will, they suggest, best be done by making direct measurements of the magnetic field strength in the loops.",

No such agent has ever been successfully linked to MS, however, either by direct isolation or by indirect (for example, serological) means, despite claims for some twenty different viruses. The epidemiological data 4 fit equally well with a model of disease induction in genetically susceptible individuals by common viruses and mediation by a secondary process, such as autoimmunization against myelin or other brain antigens.",

            "text": "The situation in MS is reminiscent of that in poliomyelitis, in which there is a clear relation between the age at which viral transmission occurs and the age at which attack by the virus on the central nervous system commences. The incidence of neurological disease increases in individuals of higher socioeconomic status within a population (because this tends to be associated with viral transmission delayed to late childhood or early adolescence) and in populations living at temperate latitudes (these, in general, enjoy a better standard of living, again with later transmission of common childhood infections). A similar requirement in MS for late viral transmission has been demonstrated in a well controlled, populationbased study that showed an almost tenfold increase in the risk of contracting MS as the age (up to puberty) of infection with common childhood viruses (such as measles) increased 5 \u2022 The ability of viruses to cause autoimmunization is not in doubt. It was shown over a decade ago 6 that measles in humans occasionally results in T-cell sensitization against myelin basic protein (MBP) and this sensitization is associated with an inflammatory demyelinating 'postinfectious' encephalomyelitis. The same relationship has been demonstrated in rats and mice infected with suitable strains of coronavirus or measles virus 7 \u2022 8 \u2022 Such 106 cross-immunization is usually attributed to molecular mimicry 9 \u2022 A recent report establishes that T-lymphocyte clones from MS patients specific for a single encephalitogenic MBP peptide recognize configurationally similar peptides of several common viruses equally well 10. These cells are stimulated by either viral or MBP peptides to proliferate and secrete inflammatory cytokines.",

Here upper respiratory and gastrointestinal virus infections appear to play a key part, as first reported by Sibley et al. 11 and dramatically confirmed more recently by Panitch 12 \u2022 The interval before relapse, however, is measured in days or weeks, whereas initiation of the process that leads to MS may span a period of years -Kurtzke, in his Faeroe Island studies, calculated an average interval of six years 3 \u2022 Also, although new T lymphocytes with pathogenic potential may be generated at each relapse, other factors may predominate, such as systemic release of inflammatory cytokines like 'Y-interferon, as part of the viral infection. This would result in upregulation of the MHC on vascular and glial elements in the central nervous system, which in turn would allow new lesion formation. Administration of 'Y-interferon in quiescent MS patients does in fact provoke symptoms of the disease, which correlate with MHC expression on circulating monocytes 13 \u2022 Time will tell whether other (non-infectious) agents also play a role in inducing MS. The infectious/autoimmunity hypothesis has proved remarkably fruitful, but other influences, such as climate, general levels of infection and neuroendocrine processes call for deeper investigation.

The idea is to withstand earthquakes. A severe shock to the structure will stop the pumps. The building will then lose, not its strength, but its stiffness.
