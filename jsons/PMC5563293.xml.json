However, the exact mechanism of ventilation-induced pro-inflammatory response that leads to VILI is still not fully understood [15\u201318].

Mean inspiratory capacity was defined as the mean value of total lung capacity (TLC) measured at 45 cm H2O airway pressure minus the FRC measured at 0 cm H2O airway pressure. The global energy load during conventional mechanical ventilation comprised a static component due to lung volume caused by the applied PEEP and a dynamic component due to the applied inspiratory pressure. The lower and upper limit of the applied global energy load was set at the value of mean global energy load \u00b12SD (equivalent to an inspiratory capacity range of 30.9\u201359.7 ml/kg ideal bodyweight). Then, the animals were subjected to different levels of PEEP and inspiratory pressures. When the mean global energy load did not exceed its lower limit, lung damage was not observed and only 1 of the 29 experimental animals did not survive the experiment. In contrast, when the mean global energy load exceeded the lower limit of the global energy load, lung injury, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and death were observed in 26 of the 47 experimental animals. In these cases, lung damage was associated with high dynamic energy load rather than high static energy load [6]. In addition, the rate of the applied strain was associated with ventilation-induced lung oedema and lung injury [21].",

This difference is clearly illustrated in the following experiment. In anaesthetised mechanically ventilated pigs, normal subpleural alveoli were filmed in real time using in vivo video microscopy. This study discovered that there was very little change in alveolar size in healthy lungs when ventilated with LV\nT (6 ml/kg ideal body weight) or with HV\nT (12 or 15 ml/kg ideal body weight). In contrast, after surfactant deactivation with a detergent as a model of ARDS, the alveoli became unstable: Many alveoli collapsed at the end of the expiration, and some of these collapsed alveoli were recruited during inspiration irrespective of the magnitude of the tidal volume. Alveoli that remained open at the end of the expiration became over-distended during the inspiration resulting in an inhomogeneous ventilation pattern in the lungs [22].",

The increased alveolar duct size is accompanied by a decrease in the alveolar diameter perpendicular to the axis of the alveolar ducts (alveolar wall compression) and by an increase in the alveolar diameter parallel to the axis of the alveolar ducts. Therefore, surfactant deactivation is accompanied by alveolar wall stretching [23]. This finding was confirmed in an experiment in anaesthetised rats by the group of Nieman. After en bloc excision of the lungs, one of the lungs was clamped and fixed in formalin at peak inspiration pressure and the other at end expiration pressure for histologic analysis. In this way, they were able to visualise the effect of surfactant deactivation (Tween-induced ARDS model) and mechanical ventilator settings on alveolar duct microstrain and the distribution of inspired air between the alveolar ducts and the alveoli (Fig. 1) [8]. Microstrain was calculated as the change in length of the alveolar ducts between inspiration and expiration normalised by their original length. As the increase in the alveolar duct size after surfactant deactivation is accompanied by alveolar wall stretching parallel to the axis of the alveolar ducts [23], alveolar duct microstrain is likely to be proportional to the alveolar wall stretching and alveolar wall strain.\n",

Previous studies have shown that APRV 75% stabilises alveoli preventing alveolar collapse during expiration, whereas an APRV 10% extends the duration of expiration resulting in alveolar collapse [12, 24, 25]. This study demonstrated that APRV 10% caused high microstrain and redistribution of air towards the alveolar ducts as compared with APRV 75%, which resulted in almost normal distribution of air (Fig. 1). The order of ventilation strategies that caused the most to the least redistribution of inspired air into alveolar ducts (inspiratory ratio C\na/A\na in Table 2) and microstrain was as follows: APRV 10%, PEEP 5, PEEP 16, APRV 75% and control (Table 2). Obviously, the least injurious ventilator settings are those that mimic the microstrain and air redistribution levels in ventilated healthy lungs with intact surfactant function (control in Fig. 1). APRV 75% resulted in near normal microstrain and alveolar air distribution, which was very similar to that measured in normal lungs, even though APRV 75% was in a Tween-induced ARDS model (Fig. 1, APRV 75% and Table 2). In this high surface tension ARDS model, the lower the PEEP (PEEP 5 vs PEEP 16) and the longer the expiratory duration (10 vs 75%), the worse the microstrain and alveolar air distribution (Fig. 1, Table 2). This research group hypothesised that the mechanism by which APRV 75% was so effective at normalizing microstrain and alveolar air distribution was as follows: The extended time at inspiration (achieved by applying continuous positive airway pressure) recruited almost all alveoli, and the very short time at expiration prevented these newly recruited alveoli from collapsing. In contrast, APRV 10% resulted in the worst microstrain and air distribution since the high pressure and extended inspiratory duration opened alveoli but the excessively long expiratory duration allowed time for all of the newly opened alveoli to collapse (Fig. 1) [8]. One mechanism of this lung protection was that APRV 75% preserved surfactant function, measured by increased concentrations of surfactant protein-A (SP-A) and SP-B in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as compared to controlled CMV with a V\nT of 10 ml/kg ideal body weight [10]. Apparently, redistribution of air towards the alveolar ducts and the increase in microstrain in controlled CMV deplete pulmonary surfactant. This supports earlier works showing that mechanical ventilation can impair pulmonary surfactant function [26, 27].\n\n",

            "text": "The histopathology of VILI is referred to as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and is very similar to the histopathology associated with experimental ARDS. Reportedly, in contrast to the animal models of ARDS [29, 30], histopathology of DAD is found in only one third to half of patients with clinical diagnosis of ARDS [31\u201333]. ARDS is caused by multiple primary disease conditions such as sepsis, haemorrhagic shock and pneumonia, and these patients will require mechanical ventilation. If set improperly, mechanical ventilation can cause a secondary VILI, which will aggravate the DAD caused by the primary disease. There are three distinctive stages in the histopathology of DAD [34, 35]: The early exudative stage initiates after 12 to 24 h with declining frequency to almost zero after 4 weeks, the late proliferative stage with increasing frequency reaching almost 100% after 4 weeks and the fibrotic stage after 1 week increasing gradually reaching about 60% after 4 weeks. In the first 12 to 24 h: capillary congestion, interstitial and alveolar oedema [34]. The oedema results mainly from capillary leakage of fluid and proteins [36]. After 24 h, the characteristic histopathology is the presence of hyaline membranes. These membranes are found adjacent to the alveolar ducts and alveolar walls consisting of eosinophilic structures with cell debris, plasma proteins and surfactant degradation products. The alveolar walls are oedematous and thickened and filled with myxoid matrix comprising fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (fibroblasts phenotype containing alpha smooth muscle actins (\u03b1-SMA)), slight infiltration of the interstitial space with lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. A significant proportion of the alveolar epithelial type I (AT I) cells and a small proportion of the AT II cells are damaged and lost leaving the alveolar membranes exposed. This means that the physical barrier against pathogens\u2014a component of the innate immunity\u2014is disrupted. Self-renewal of the epithelium (AT I and AT II cells) is performed by the AT II cells [37] and is accompanied by AT II hyperplasia which appears in 3 to 6 days. Mild endothelial injury is also reported [34]. In the proliferative phase of DAD, hyaline membranes are no longer prominent. The characteristic histopathology in the interstitium is the proliferation of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and AT II cells mixed with occasional inflammatory cells. This granulation tissue breaks through the basement membrane into the alveolar spaces. The proliferating AT II cells show metaplasia resembling squamous cell carcinoma [34]. These AT II cells migrate over the surface of the alveolar granulation tissue and the intraalveolar exudate establishing the so-called fibrosis by accretion [38]. In addition, fibrosis is also formed by collagen deposits in the process of the organization of the interstitial oedema [34]. These processes and the increase in the surface tension by the deficient surfactant production and function in the inflammatory process lead to the collapse of the alveoli, size reduction of the remaining open alveoli and dilated alveolar ducts [23, 38]. After 3 to 4 weeks, granulation tissue of the fibrotic process dominates the lung histology. Enlarged airspaces\u2014most likely in the alveolar ducts [8, 23, 38]\u2014are outlined by collapsed alveoli with thickened alveolar walls [34]. The percentage of fibrosis and the amount of interstitial tissue increase over time [39]. In addition, the normally non-muscular small arteries are being muscularised and muscular arteries show intimal and subintimal fibrous thickening. This development may end in pulmonary hypertension [34].",

Surfactant protein (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D) synthesis starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The surfactant protein molecules are transported from the ER to the Golgi complex. SP-A and SP-D are excreted directly to the extracellular space [40]. SP-A and SP-D (both are hydrophilic protein molecules) belong to the collectins, a family of calcium-dependent sugar-binding proteins (lectins) containing collagen-like sequences and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). Collectins are soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs, components of the innate immunity) that can identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and several danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [41, 42]. SP-B and SP-C plus ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3, a surfactant lipid transporter) are transported from the Golgi complex to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Fusion of MVBs and the lamellar bodies (LBs) leads to the proteolytic process of SP-B and SP-C to the mature form. The surfactant lipids are produced in the ER as well but transported directly to the LBs by means of the lipid transporter ABCA3. The hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C are essential in the packing process of surfactant lipid molecules in the LBs [40].",

In the extracellular space, ATP can be detected in much lower (nanomolar) concentrations around resting cells [44]. Certain conditions may cause the release of ATP. In cell stress conditions such as an infection, ATP can be released in a controlled manner through pannexin hemichannels (mainly Panx1) [45, 46], connexin channels (mainly Cx43) [47, 48], certain chloride channels (maxi-anion channels, volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), chloride channel (ClC) family and calcium-activated chloride channel (CACC)) [49] and P2X7 ATP receptors (P2X7Rs) [50, 51] to >1000-fold of the resting state levels to micromolar concentrations. In cell ischemia and cell necrosis, ATP is released massively and uncontrolled [43, 52, 53]. Infection (such as in ARDS due to infectious agents) induces the release of extracellular ATP by many inflammatory cells and tissue cells (such as the AT I cells) [43, 52, 53]. In non-infectious circumstances such as physiological mechanical deformation (stretch or compression during breathing or mechanical ventilation) of the AT I cells stimulates the P2X7Rs followed by the controlled release of ATP molecules through the P2X7R channel into the extracellular space (Fig. 2) [54, 57].\n",

            "text": "Recently, using real-time luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence imaging coupled with simultaneous infrared differential interference contrast imaging, Furuya et al. were able to produce real-time imaging of inflation-induced ATP release in the ex vivo rat lung. They observed that lung inflation induces ATP release into alveolar spaces and into pulmonary blood capillaries [58]. In this way, extracellular purine nucleotides (such as ATP) play the key role in the extracellular signalling (purinergic signalling) of many biological processes and can activate purinergic receptors\u2014for example, the P2Y2R\u2014on the cell membranes [52]. The extracellular ATP originating from the AT I cells, released through the P2X7Rs by mechanical deformation, activates the P2Y2Rs on the surface of the AT II cells. The P2Y2R is a metabotropic G protein-coupled ATP receptor (GPCR). Activation of the P2Y2R by ATP results in the release of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) into the cytoplasm. DAG activates the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) that promotes the fusion of LBs with the cell membrane (Fig. 2). Cytoplasmic IP3 results in the release of intracellular Ca2+ by stores that are sensitive to IP3 and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space through several pathways (TRPV2 and STIM1/Orai1). The increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ level also promotes the fusion of the LBs with the cell membrane of the AT II cells and creates a fusion pore causing the P2X4Rs in the membrane of the LBs to be exposed to the extracellular ATP (Fig. 2). Activation of these P2X4Rs by extracellular ATP strongly increases the local Ca2+ concentration around the membrane of the fused vesicles to a much higher level (Fig. 2). This process\u2014referred to as \u2018fusion-activated\u2019 Ca2+ entry (FACE)\u2014promotes a significant expansion of the fusion pore resulting in surfactant release by the AT II cells (LBs unpacking). Thus, the AT I cells induce the unpacking of LBs by the AT II cells in a paracrine manner (Fig. 2) [54, 55, 59, 60]. In addition, at a higher degree of stretch of the AT II in vitro (probably comparable to a deep sigh), ATP molecules can be released to the extracellular space and induce LBs unpacking in an autocrine manner [57].",

In rat glomerular mesangial cell culture, 72% of the cells show an increase in Ca2+ levels during a 2-min stimulus with 100 \u03bcM ATP through the P2Y2Rs. In contrast to the p2X7Rs, the P2Y2Rs start to desensitise within 1 min, and the sensitivity to stimuli reaches its minimum within 2 to 4 min [61, 62]. After a recovery period of another 4 min, only 38% of the cells respond to a second stimulus. The response following the second stimulus is much weaker than the first stimulus [62]. The P2X4Rs become desensitised faster than the P2Y2Rs (within a few seconds after a stimulus with ATP), and the sensitivity to stimuli reaches its minimum after 30 to 60 s [63, 64]. Therefore, vigorous mechanical deformation of the AT I cells may cause excessive extracellular release of ATP but is unlikely to cause massive LBs unpacking.",

Some of the lipid molecules are taken up by the lysosomes for further degradation [40]; (4) phosphates from degraded lipids are returned to the AT II cells by means of the sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2B (coded by the transcription factor SLC34a2) [40].",

Moreover, surfactant production can be decreased by pulmonary infection [67] and by hyperoxia (ventilation with air with 98% oxygen content) [68]. Surfactant deactivation by extravasated serum proteins [69] and the conversion of the active to the non-active surfactant subfraction contribute to further surfactant impairment [27]. Loss of surfactant production is accompanied by the deficiency of SP-A and SP-D molecules. As discussed above, SP-A and SP-D are soluble PRRs; they are important components of the innate immunity for the recognition of PAMPs and several DAMPs [41, 42]. Therefore, deficiency of SP-A and SP-D weakens the immune defence against invading pathogens.",

            "text": "Although many ATP receptors play a role in the activation of the pro-inflammatory immune response (Table 3), activated P2X7Rs are important initiators of the pro-inflammatory response by the innate immunity [43, 53, 210]. P2X7R is an ATP receptor and an intrinsic cation channel, but here, the P2X7R serves as an ATP receptor initiating intracellular transduction. Furthermore, the P2X7Rs have a low affinity for ATP molecules. They are activated only when the concentration of extracellular ATP is quite high reaching millimolar concentrations [70, 211], for example, during a severe inflammation leading to ARDS and/or vigorous mechanical deformation of the AT I cells (Fig. 3). In these conditions with high levels of extracellular ATP, the P2X7R does not appear to exhibit desensitization [64, 215]. Consequently, high levels of extracellular ATP molecules continuously act as DAMPs and activate the immune system [43, 53, 70]. In case of massive release, ATP may saturate the ATP hydrolysis enzymes CD39 and CD73 causing persistent high ATP levels despite the conversion to adenosine. The resulting pro-inflammatory immune response causes damage to the lung tissue and ends in DAD. Interstitial and alveolar oedema are the result of capillary leakage due to the pro-inflammatory response in the early exudative stage of DAD [34, 36].\n",

The devastation of the normal alveolar histology in DAD is such that the tight junctions between the epithelial cells are indeed disrupted. But massive ATP release by alveolar epithelial cells after H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) [218, 219], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [220, 221] and parainfluenza infection virus infection [222] as detected by increased ATP in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) have also been reported. Consequently, activation of P2X7Rs in epithelial cells and macrophages after a viral infection results in a pro-inflammatory response of the innate immune system [151] (Table 3, rows 63\u201366 and row 76) [162\u2013164, 174] and lung tissue injury. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to assess whether the influenza-induced ENaC inhibition in the lung tissue plays a significant role in the development of alveolar oedema in ARDS with profound capillary leakage as part of the pro-inflammatory response and disrupted alveolar histology (DAD).",

            "text": "After several hours of in vitro mechanical deformation of Calu-3 cells (a human airway epithelial cell line that shows cAMP-dependent Cl\u2212 secretion [223]), the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of CD39 and CD73 are upregulated [212]. Moreover, CD39 expression is upregulated in severe infection such as sepsis [214]. This is probably the consequence of increased TGF-\u03b2 release due to the activation P2X7Rs by extracellular ATP (Table 3, row 77) [175, 176] and increased IFN-\u03b2 [224\u2013226] due to the activation of P2Y6Rs by extracellular ATP as presented in Table 3 row 92 [193]. Consequently, extracellular levels of ATP gradually decrease to a certain level, and extracellular adenosine increases. In general, adenosine has potent anti-inflammatory properties. Prolonged high levels of extracellular ATP lead to high levels of extracellular adenosine and to the secondary suppression of the innate and adaptive immune system (Fig. 3). The suppressive effects of extracellular adenosine on the adaptive immune system are presented in Table 3, rows 6\u20138 [81\u201384], 24\u201329 [106\u2013112], 37 [125], 38 [126] and row 104 [206]. Note that adenosine promotes the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to CD4+FoxP3+Lag3+ Tregs [106], increases the numbers of Tregs [112], increases the expression of the co-inhibitory surface molecule CTLA-4 on Tregs [112] and upregulates the expression of CD39 and CD73 on Tregs [112]. Tregs are potent inhibitors of the activation and function of effector T cells and potent inhibitors of the maturation and function of DCs [227]. Moreover, Tregs reduce the survival of effector T cells [227]. This causes immune paralysis against secondary specific infections. Additionally, lung tissue damage due to DAD is accompanied by the disruption of the physical barrier, a component of the innate immunity for the defence against invading pathogens and by a decrease of certain soluble PRRs (SP-A and SP-D) production [41, 42].",

[213]: Intratracheally ATP or UTP (100 and 200 mM) instilled mice showed a progressive increase in wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio of the lungs during the first 18 h, the extent of the increased W/D ratio was dose dependent. There was also a significant increase in the albumin permeability index. In comparison to the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ATP induced an increase in the gene expression (mRNA) of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) within 60 min after the administration [213]. Note that the gene expression of IL-1\u03b2 was not increased because ATP regulates the posttranscriptional activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes [152, 228, 229], and this cannot be detected with the applied RT-PCR technique. There was a considerable rise in the number of neutrophil and macrophage counts in the BALF. These effects appeared in intratracheally ATP instilled mice and in mice mechanically ventilated with a V\nT of 40 ml/kg ideal body weight but not with a V\nT of 8 ml/kg. The ATP levels in BALF specimens in the high V\nT group were significantly increased when compared to the low V\nT group. In addition, the increased W/D weight ratio, albumin permeability and cytokine production (with the exception of TNF-\u03b1) in the intratracheal ATP group were mitigated by the administration of pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2\u2032, 4\u2032-disulfonic acid (PPADS), a semi-selective antagonist of the purinergic receptor P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors [213].",

Strain was defined as the proportion of radial length change of the monolayer during each stretch cycle. They found that the extent of the applied cell strain was proportional to the extracellular level of ATP and the extent of plasma membrane damage. Adding a small amount of ATP (10 \u03bcM) or ecto-enzyme inhibitor ARL 67156 (100 \u03bcM) decreased the proportion of the lethally wounded AT I cells. The addition of adenosine (5 \u03bcg/ml) did not provide increased cytoprotection. The addition of apyrase (20 U/ml) or apyrase combined with ADA (5 U/ml) to increase the extracellular adenosine levels at the expense of the extracellular ATP levels caused an increase in the proportion of the lethally wounded AT I cells ruling out a potential adenosynergic cytoprotection pathway. Apparently, elevated extracellular ATP levels to micromolar concentrations facilitated the plasma membrane wound healing by increasing the fusion of the calcium-sensitive lysosomes with the plasma membrane at the wound site. ATP induced this process in the AT I cells in an autocrine manner through the P2Y2Rs activating the IP3 and DAG/PKC pathways [230]. This process is similar to the paracrine ATP-induced fusion of the LBs with the cell membrane of the AT II cells [54, 55, 59].",

At this inspiratory pressure level, the lung volume reached TLC with a strain of 2.5 (strain was defined as the inspiratory volume divided by the functional residual capacity) [20, 231]. In CD39\u2212/\u2212 and in CD73\u2212/\u2212 knockout mice, diffuse lung injury was far more severe than in the WT mice [212]. Intraperitoneal administration of soluble CD39 in CD39\u2212/\u2212 mice and soluble CD73 in CD73\u2212/\u2212 mice attenuated the lung injury severity to the level of the WT mice [212]. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of soluble CD39 or CD73 in WT mice treated with the injurious mechanical ventilation increased the survival significantly, decreased the VILI score and increased the pulmonary adenosine levels [212]. As mentioned above, the very high strain levels cause a massive ATP release saturating the ATP hydrolysis enzymes CD39 and CD73 with persisting high ATP levels. The administered soluble CD39 and CD73 convert the excessive ATP molecules to adenosine causing the inflammatory ATP levels to drop and the anti-inflammatory adenosine levels to rise. In addition, adenosine attenuates the ventilator-induced capillary leakage through AdoRA2B receptor signalling (Table 3, row 43) [129].",

Prolonged high levels of extracellular adenosine result in immunosuppression, the production of fibrotic proteins and finally end in fibrosis (Fig. 3). Reportedly, adenosine-dependent fibrosis occurs in mice with ADA deficiency. In these mice, ADA suppletion leads to the resolution of the fibrosis [233, 234]. On top of the increased TGF-\u03b2 expression by the activation of P2X7Rs (Table 3, row 77) [175, 176], activation of AdoRA2B increases the expression of TGF-\u03b2, \u03b1-SMA, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2), IL-6 and fibronectin in fibroblasts. These proteins are known to be pro-fibrotic (Table 3, row 47) (Fig. 3) [132]. One of the pro-fibrotic properties of TGF-\u03b2 is the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental underlying pathogenic factor in lung fibrosis [235]. Presumably, treatment with IFN-\u03b2-1a, with soluble CD39 or with CD73, increases the adenosine levels. In turn, this probably leads to a significant decrease in extracellular ATP reducing the inflammation and the release of extracellular ATP by the lung tissue cells and the immune cells. For a proportion of patients [232] and experimental animals [212], this may well be enough to halt the progression of DAD.",

In addition, damage to the AT I and AT II cells (due to DAD) results in a decrease in surfactant production, extravasated serum proteins and the conversion of the active to the non-active surfactant subfraction ending in surfactant function impairment. The escalation of this process by ventilation (controlled CMV or APRV 10%) increases the extracellular ATP levels and surfactant impairment even further.

This ventilator strategy prevents the redistribution of inspired air towards the alveolar ducts, stabilises the alveoli, minimises the microstrain and limits the release of extracellular ATP by the cells, especially by the AT I cells. Consequently, the innate immune response is reduced, and the AT I, AT II cells and surfactant function are restored. Properly set, APRV 75% appeared to do just that by opening the lung and keeping it open, in experimental settings [7\n8\n11] and in a clinical statistical analysis [9] (Fig. 5 (right panel)). The rationale behind the lung tissue protective effect of the APRV 75%-induced recruitment and stabilization in surfactant-impaired ARDS model in animals is through understanding dynamic alveolar mechanics. Alveoli are not elastic (i.e. change size in a one to one relationship with the applied stress, which would be the V\nT); rather, alveoli are a viscoelastic system. A viscoelastic system is represented best by the spring and dashpot [240]. In a viscoelastic system, there is a delay in the strain (i.e. change in alveolar size) following the applied stress, which in the case of the lung is the inspiratory pressure. At least two conditions have to be fulfilled to recruit the collapsed viscoelastic alveoli: (1) sufficiently high airway pressure of >30 cm H2O and (2) long enough duration of the pressure (varies between 2 s and several minutes for the individual alveolus due to the inhomogeneous nature of the collapsed alveoli) to allow the alveoli to be recruited [236, 237]. This is known as the creep phenomenon of the viscoelastic system [240]. Thus, by extending the time at inspiration (i.e. increasing the duration of the applied stress), we gradually \u2018nudge\u2019 alveoli open over time [236]. Fully recruiting the lung eliminates stress concentrators, a major VILI mechanism [238]. The lung is stabilised by a very short time at expiration. If the stress (i.e. inspiratory pressure) is released very quickly for a very short time, the viscoelastic alveoli will not have time to empty, maintaining a PEEP. Thus, the short expiratory duration stabilises the lung by two mechanisms: time and pressure. Using our understanding of dynamic alveolar mechanics and the fact that alveoli are viscoelastic, we use the MBP parameter of duration to open and stabilise the lung. Using a short expiratory duration stabilises alveoli and prevents the redistribution of the inspired air towards the alveolar ducts and prevents vigorous cyclic deformation of the alveoli [8], which, in turn, prevents massive extracellular ATP release, massive short-term surfactant release, followed by surfactant function impairment, interstitial and alveolar oedema and activation of the innate immunity leading to the development or aggravation of DAD. This presumably prevents the loss of AT I cells, prevents the hyperplasia of AT II cells and restores the surfactant function, and the affected lung regions start to regain their normal compliance (increase their alveolar time constant).",

The lowest alveolar stability and the highest microstrain are seen in APRV 10% and PEEP 5. Microstrain is calculated as the change in length of the alveolar ducts between inspiration and expiration normalised by their original length. The difference between the control group and PEEP 5 is exclusively attributed to the surfactant function.

            "text": "Fig. 2: Schematic presentation of the fusion-activated Ca2+ entry (FACE). AT I cells release ATP to the extracellular space through the P2X7R (ATP receptor that can function as an ATP channel) provoked by mechanical deformation (compression or stretching) [43, 54\u201356]. The extracellular ATP activates the P2Y2Rs on the surface of the AT II cells in a paracrine manner. The G protein-coupled P2Y2 ATP receptor releases DAG and IP3 into the cytoplasm. DAG release leads to the activation of PKC-dependent pathway of fusion of LBs with the cell membrane. IP3 release results in the release of intracellular Ca2+ by stores that are sensitive to IP3 and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space through several pathways (TRPV2 and STIM1/Orai1). Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ level also promotes the fusion of the LBs with the cell membrane of the AT II cells. These two processes create a fusion pore causing the P2X4 ATP receptors in the membrane of the LBs to be exposed to extracellular ATP. Activation of these P2X4Rs by extracellular ATP strongly increases the local Ca2+ concentration to a much higher level around the membrane of the fused vesicles (FACE). FACE promotes a significant expansion of the fusion pore resulting in surfactant release by the AT II cells (LBs unpacking) and is accompanied by the FACE-induced cations and water migration from the alveolar space to the subepithelial interstitium. Clearance of the ATP molecules from the extracellular space occurs through the stepwise conversion by ecto-enzymes or by soluble extracellular enzymes (CD39 and CD73) to adenosine (ADO). ADO is returned to the cytoplasm through ENTs or CNTs and converted by ADA to inosine in the cytoplasm or converted by soluble ADA in the extracellular space.

            "text": "Fig. 3: Putative model of local tissue purinergic signalling, pathogen barriers, adaptive immunity and pro-fibrotic proteins during ARDS and/or VILI [70]. In the very early phase of ARDS and VILI, infection [43, 52, 53] and vigorous mechanical deformation of the alveoli by mechanical ventilation [212, 213] lead to the substantial increase of extracellular ATP. The ATP levels exceed the threshold for the activation of P2X7R and induce pro-inflammatory immune response [70, 211]. This causes capillary congestion and capillary leakage causing interstitial and alveolar oedema. CD39 expression is upregulated in severe sepsis [214] and after several hours of mechanical ventilation [212]. Consequently, extracellular levels of ATP gradually decrease to a certain extent and extracellular adenosine increases. In general, adenosine has potent anti-inflammatory properties. This may lead to immune paralysis against secondary specific infections. Moreover, lung tissue damage due to DAD is accompanied by the disruption of the physical barrier as a component of the innate immunity for the defence against invading pathogens and by decreased Sp-A and Sp-D levels that function as soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system. This renders the host susceptible to invading pathogens [42]. TGF-\u03b2 expression is increased by the activation of P2X7Rs [175, 176] and activation of the adenosine receptor AdoRA2B [132]. AdoRA2B activation also increases the expression of TGF-\u03b2 and other fibrotic factors such as alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2), IL-6, fibronectin, VEGF, CD206, arginase-1, hyaluronan, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like factor-1, etc. (Table 3, rows 40, 44, 47 and 49) [128, 130, 132, 239]",
