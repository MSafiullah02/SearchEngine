Rather, Dr Li's astute, on-the-ground observational skills led him to warn his fellow medical school alumni of a possible \u201cSARS-like\u201d epidemic via a post on the Chinese messaging app WeChat on December 30, 2019. Presaging the international acknowledgement of the current coronavirus crisis by more than 3 weeks,2 he correctly recognized the enormous significance of 7 patients from a local seafood market who were quarantined at his hospital with the SARS-like illness that would later be identified as coronavirus. His warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive imaging studies, but on his own understanding of biological plausibility\u2014the kind of analysis that physicians of all specialties could make.",

Although clinical experience and case reports are at the bottom of the hierarchy of evidence, they have value, particularly when they describe new clinical entities.4 How many respected journals would have published Dr Li's warning based on these 7 patients? Probably none. Publication in a peer-review journal usually requires solid evidence and more than just well-reasoned conjecture, so rapid dissemination of such information is usually limited to social media and non\u2013peer-reviewed websites and publications. For that reason, attempts to limit the broadcasting of this kind of communication would be by commercial entities and governments and would fall beyond the purview of editorial boards.",
