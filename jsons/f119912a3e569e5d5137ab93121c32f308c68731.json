In terms of causing acute respiratory infection in humans, the most important picornaviruses are the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses.

Individually, the incidence of acute nasopharyngitis in adults ranges from 2 to 4 cases per year and in children from 6 to 8 cases per year.6,7 Although picornavirus-induced nasopharyngitis is often referred to as the common cold, the morbidity associated with these infections should not be trivialized.
