Here, we evaluated the in vivo systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune responses induced by a single intramuscular or intragastric administration of recombinant adenoviral type 5 (Ad5) or type 41 (Ad41) -based vaccines expressing the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein. Intragastric administration of either Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody in serum; however, antigen-specific T-cell responses were not detected. In contrast, after a single intramuscular dose of Ad5-S or Ad41-S, functional antigen-specific T-cell responses were elicited in the spleen and pulmonary lymphocytes of the mice, which persisted for several months. Both rAdbased vaccines administered intramuscularly induced systemic humoral immune responses (neutralizing IgG antibodies). Our results show that a single dose of Ad5-S-or Ad41-S-based vaccines represents an appealing strategy for the control of MERS-CoV infection and transmission.",

            "text": "Recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vectors have been widely used in studies of both gene therapy and vaccine delivery. 10 They represent attractive vectors for vaccine development because of their characteristics of growth to a high titre, manufacturability, and adequate space within the genome for gene insertion. Adenoviruses have been safely used as a vaccine for acute respiratory syndrome and are being tested as novel vaccine systems for numerous infectious agents ranging from malaria to HIV-1. 10, 11 Similar strategies based on serologically distinct adenoviruses could allow for successful repeat immunizations. [10] [11] [12] There are more than 50 types of human adenoviruses, which are classified into seven distinct species (A-G), each with a different set of tissue-specific tropisms. 13 An example of these differences can be seen with adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad41; Ad5 is an airway pathogen shown to induce potent systemic responses, whereas Ad41 is a human serotype F virus that homes to the gastrointestinal tract, 14, 15 which is resistant to inactivation by gastric acid, bile salt and proteases. Ad5 vectors have been tested for use in intramuscular (i.m.) immunizations and in DNA-rAd vaccine regimens in human clinical trials, providing an important proof of concept for adenovirus-based vaccine vectors. 9, 16 Ad41-based vaccines have yet to be tested clinically; however, the natural tropism of this virus for the gastrointestinal tract may prove beneficial in terms of delivering antigen to an otherwise hostile gut environment. 14, 15 This tropism may allow for the oral administration of vaccine vectors, as well as the enhanced induction of mucosal immunity, 17 thereby decreasing the likelihood of pathogen transmission via the mucosa. The recent development of a replication-deficient recombinant Ad41 (rAd41) vector expressing the HIV envelope protein (Env) strongly supports this hypothesis, as this construct has been shown to induce HIV Env-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses after prime-boost immunization. 18, 19 Most adenoviruses infect their host through the airway epithelium and replicate in the mucosal tissue of the respiratory tract. 9, 13 Accordingly, these pathogens are capable of eliciting robust mucosal immune responses, making them an attractive antigen delivery system in the fight against other mucosal viruses, including MERS-CoV. Moreover, the S protein represents a promising target for preventive and therapeutic intervention against MERS-CoV because of its critical role in the early stages of viral infection. 7 Here, we evaluated the use of two adenovirus vectors for the development of recombinant vaccines against MERS-CoV. Replication-deficient Ad5 and Ad41 expressing the MERS-CoV S protein were used to immunize mice via different routes of delivery, and the humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses of the animals were examined to assess the potential efficacy of the vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.",

Furthermore, a higher dose of rAd41-S induced humoral and cellular immune responses, similar to rAd5-S, following an i.m. challenge, suggesting that rAd41 is a good substitute for rAd5 in the induction of systemic immunity. However, antigen-specific immunity in sera and mucosal sites were dramatically higher following the i.m. vaccination with Ad5-S than other groups. Novel vectors that possess natural mucosal tropism may have advantages over some of the more common vectors in terms of administration, safety and vaccine potency. 18, 19, [28] [29] [30] The gut tropism of Ad41 indicates that the rAd41 vector may be a more efficient inducer of mucosal immune responses when administered via an oral or i.g. route. 14, 18, 30 Here, a single i.g. dose of rAd41-MERS-S induced significant humoral immunity in serum. However, no significant antigen-specific T-cell responses were detected in the spleens and pulmonary lymphocytes of mice immunized intragastrically with Ad5-MERS-S or Ad41-MERS-S, in contrast to studies suggesting that mucosal administration is advantageous for inducing T-lymphocyte responses at mucosal surfaces. 19 Additional studies will be necessary to fully define these differences and their underlying mechanisms, and they may improve our ability to design vaccines and regimens that target polyfunctional systemic and mucosal immunity to particular infectious agents.",

Although recent progress has been made, robust stimulation of mucosal immunity remains difficult. Several approaches have been used to elicit mucosal immune responses using rAd5based vaccines. 18, 19, 31 Intranasal immunization with a rAd5 vaccine generated stronger IgA responses in systemic and mucosal compartments than i.m. immunization in mice; however, safety concerns may limit the use of the approach in humans. 28 In addition, oral immunization is the most convenient way to deliver mucosal vaccines. Heterologous rAd41 oral or ileal priming followed by an i.m. rAd5 boost elicits enhanced intestinal mucosal cellular immunity. 18 In this study, we found that antigenspecific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were induced by the i.g. administration of rAd5-based or rAd41-based vaccines expressing the S protein of MERS-CoV. This immunization strategy is associated with increased safety and applicability relative to an oral challenge, making it an excellent choice for future vaccine development efforts. Furthermore, as increasing evidence supports a role for dromedary camels as a reservoir of MERS-CoV, 32 our vaccination strategy may hold promise for the development of a preventive vaccine that targets the animal reservoir; and this may be an effective approach to eliminate the transmission of MERS-CoV to humans.",

It is widely accepted that systemic immunization with protein-or peptide-based vaccine induces only weak or short-term cellular immune responses. rRBD subunit immunization studies, we reported here that a sustained mucosal as well as systemic cellular immune response was induced in mice by single administration with Ad5-S or Ad41-S via the i.m. route ( Fig. 4  and 5) . Together, these studies demonstrate the possibility of generating sustained mucosal and systemic T-cell-mediated immunity using rAd5-or rAd41-based MERS-CoV vaccines; however, further optimization will be necessary before advancing into human clinical trials.",

            "text": "Previous reports showed that the route of vaccination critically impacts not only the magnitude but also the phenotype and trafficking of antigen-specific immunity in mice. 19 Despite the many attractive features of mucosal vaccination, it has often proven difficult in practice to stimulate strong immune responses and protection by mucosal administration of antigens. Oral or i.g. immunization with rAd5 or rAd41 vectors targeted the digestive epithelium, where the induction of mucosal and systemic immunity is well documented. 14, 18, 19, 30 Other studies have suggested that mucosal routing of vaccine vectors may be used to optimize mucosal and cellular immunity. [33] [34] [35] [36] In this study, we found that the route of rAd vector delivery critically impacted both systemic and mucosal immunity. In particular, i.m. rAd immunization consistently generated high-level T-lymphocyte responses among the systemic and mucosal compartments. In contrast, i.g. immunization generated no detectable T lymphocytes in both serum and mucosal sites. Our finding suggests that a single i.m. dose of Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced strong, persistent and complementary systemic and mucosal immunity, and represents an appealing strategy for the control of MERS-CoV transmission. Continued development of appropriate formulations such as enteric coatings or nanoparticles might allow these vectors to be more amenable to clinical applications. 37, 38 Overall, we examined the effects of administration route on immune responses using a single dose of Ad5 or Ad41 vectors as the vaccination agent in this study. During the preparation of this manuscript, a different group reported that antibody responses against the S protein were sufficient for neutralizing MERS-CoV in vitro. 39 These responses could be induced using an i.m. vaccination with rAd5-based MERS-CoV candidate vaccines followed by a secondary intranasal boost 3 weeks later. Our results indicated that a single i.m. or i.g. administration of Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced S-antigen-specific systemic and mucosal immunity. Furthermore, the most significant and sustained neutralizing antibody production as well as cell-mediated immunity could be elicited by rAd5-based vaccine via the intramuscular route. Because no fulllength S protein was available on hand, all evolution of the antibody response (IgG and IgA) against S was limited to RBD-specific antibodies. We understand that other S-protein-specific antibodies may play a role in the neutralization and protection of the infection, although the majority of RBD-specific antibodies are neutralizing. In addition, the protocol of IgA assay for evaluation of mucosal immunity in this study needs to be further optimized. Although further study will be necessary to evaluate the protective efficacy of rAd5-MERS-S or rAd41-MERS-S vectors in humans and dromedary camels, our results strongly support a role for rAd5-or rAd41encoding MERS-S antigens as a safe and effective strategy for MERS-CoV prevention.
