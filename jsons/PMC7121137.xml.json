Among the Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, and South Indian populations, HLA-B*1502 correlates with increased risk for SJS/TEN induced by aromatic antiepileptic agents such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin.

At this time, the skin demonstrates a \u201cwet cigarette paper\u201d appearance (Fig. 24.2). Friction or pressure easily detaches the epidermis, exposing an erythematous, often bleeding or \u201cscalded\u201d dermis. In this second phase, large tracts of epidermal denudation develop. With epidermal cleavage, blisters arise as fluid fills the space between the dermis and epidermis. These flaccid, easily-ruptured blisters may be extended laterally by pressure of the thumb, a feature known as a positive Asboe-Hansen sign. Tense vesicles or bullae may occasionally be observed, typically only in the palmar or plantar regions as the thicker epidermal layer of these surfaces more readily resists pressure.\n",

With total IVIG doses of 2.7, 4, and 3.4 g/kg, survival rates were 88 %, 94 %, and 100 %, respectively. In contrast, other studies comparing total IVIG doses of 1.6 or 2.8 g/kg IVIG to supportive therapy alone report no appreciable mortality benefit. In another trial, 2 g/kg of total IVIG revealed no measurable effect on disease progression or rate of re-epithelialization, and no improvement in mortality predicted by SCORTEN. A larger, retrospective analysis conducted in the RegiSCAR cohort confirmed this lack of survival benefit, albeit at a lower IVIG dose. It has been suggested that optimal therapeutic efficacy may not be achieved by total doses of less than 2 g/kg; this may partially account for the discordant results of these trials.",
