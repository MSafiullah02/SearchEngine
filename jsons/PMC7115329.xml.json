            "text": "In May 2010, a behavioral observation study was undertaken involving phase 3 medical students at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Ethical approval was obtained from the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee prior to the commencement of the study. The student cohort had completed a one 4-hour infection control course in the previous 12 months. The infection control course included education on hand hygiene, aseptic technique, standard precautions, and transmission-based precautions. The same student cohort attended two 2-hour lectures unrelated to infection control, on 2 separate occasions. One week before the 2-hour lecture commenced, students were informed that a behavioral observation study was being conducted during the lecture and required the students to be videotaped while they listened to the lecture. Students were not informed about which behaviors were under observation to blind them from the aims of the study; this was necessary to minimize the potential for a change in behavior as a result of being observed.13 To participate in the study, students were instructed to move to a marked area on the left side of the lecture theatre and complete a participant consent form. To opt out of the study, students were instructed to move to the right side of the lecture theatre outside of the videotape recording range. Students were also informed that they could withdraw from the study once recording commenced by simply moving to the other side of the theatre. All participants consented prior to videotape recording.",

Colonization of the nasal mucous membranes with S aureus is common and ranges from 20%-30% in health care and community settings.7 Nose touching was common among our participants. This finding supports the importance of hand hygiene as a means of preventing occupationally acquired colonization with S aureus from patients or the contaminated environment.8, 10, 20, 21\nS aureus can survive for up to 5 years on hard surfaces, and no obvious role has yet been attributed to colonized staff.7 When mixed with hospital dust, S aureus can still survive for >1 year until it is picked up from the environment.22, 23 Contaminated hands may act as a vector, transmitting the bacteria from a contaminated surface to the HCW's nasopharynx via face touching. High hand hygiene compliance before and after patient contact should reduce the likelihood of transferring pathogens through self-inoculation and in turn prevent inoculation of patients.10, 24, 25 Pathogens found on stethoscopes have also been recovered from physician's hands.26 Given the habitual face-touching behavior observed in our study, it is possible that the inoculation of stethoscopes and other contaminated medical equipment may have been the result of inoculation from nose touching to hands and subsequently to the stethoscope. Given the frequency of face-touching behavior observed in this study, clinicians must practice hand hygiene before and after using such equipment to ensure that patient equipment is kept clean prior to use.",
