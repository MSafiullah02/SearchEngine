Fifteen patients out of 15 requiring mechanical ventilation had ARDS (8/15 severe by 72 hours). Although most did not present with shock, 67% received vasopressors. Cardiomyopathy developed in 33%. As of March 17, mortality was 67%, 24% of patients have remained critically ill, and 9.5% have been discharged from the ICU.",

Palliative care teams, as the experts in conducting goals of care discussions with patients and families who are informed by prognostic information, are now faced with the difficult task of trying to help patients and families navigate a disease in which short-term prognostic data are limited and long-term prognostic data are nonexistent. These two cohort studies examined the factors associated with risk of ARDS and death in patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Although their findings are valuable for palliative care teams to be aware of, they are preliminary. Because a significant minority of patients remained hospitalized on ventilators at the time of publication, the reported mortality rates may be even higher (or lower, although that is less likely) when longer-term data are available. In addition, these early reports are unable to provide insight into longer-term outcomes that are important to many of our patients, such as function and ability to live independently. To expertly guide patients through this often devastating illness, palliative care professionals will need to keep abreast of the COVID-19 literature as the pandemic evolves and the longer-term outcomes come into sharper focus.",

Prioritizing critically ill patients most likely to survive to hospital discharge is inadequate because it ignores other considerations such as number of years of life saved and whether people have essential responsibilities in saving lives (reciprocity for putting themselves at risk). Ventilation should be presented to patients/families as a time-limited therapy (not an unlimited promise), but ventilation duration must not be too brief to avoid discontinuing ventilators from patients who (if treated longer) would have survived. A triage officer/team, not the treating physician, should make allocation/discontinuation decisions (to enhance objectivity, avoid commitment conflicts, and minimize treatment clinicians' moral distress). After discontinuing ventilation, comprehensive palliative care is imperative (families should be granted personal protective equipment so they can be with the dying patient, or hospitals should help families use videoconferencing technology). Pennsylvania and Minnesota have endorsed the following strategy: patients meeting usual medical indications for intensive care unit beds/ventilators are assigned a priority score (lower scores indicate greater likelihood of benefit) based on the patient's likelihood of surviving to discharge and achieving longer-term survival (comorbid conditions), and individuals performing vital public health tasks are given heightened priority by subtracting points from their score. Younger patients are prioritized in the event of tying scores.",

(3) For patients with similar prognoses, equality should be operationalized through random allocation rather than as first-come, first-served. (4) Prioritization guidelines should differ by intervention and should respond to changing scientific evidence (eg, the value of maximizing saving lives justifies giving older people priority for vaccines immediately after healthcare workers and first responders). (5) Vaccine/therapeutic research participants should receive some priority for COVID-19 interventions.

The second relates scientific evidence and experience from past pandemics to the current situation. Its recommendations are articulated with examples applicable to clinical practice. A key message in both articles is that treating clinicians should not make these decisions for their own patients; fair allocation of resources must be made by third, unbiased parties. In both articles, authors recognize the challenges inherent in these decisions, including that there may be no clear answer, different institutions will proceed differently, and these cases take an emotional toll on all involved.",

Keywords: Noncancer Disease Categories, Health Service Delivery, Pediatric Care Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers Exposed to Coronavirus Disease Background: One year after the 2003 outbreak, SARS survivors (including healthcare workers) showed elevated psychological distress. 1 What factors are associated with mental health outcomes (MHOs) among Chinese healthcare workers treating patients with COVID-19? Design and Participants: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study assessed MHOs among healthcare workers treating patients with COVID-19 in Chinese hospitals (January 29 to February 3). Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress were assessed via Chinese versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GADS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IESR). Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with MHOs.",

            "text": "Clinicians always should strive to avoid intensive life-sustaining treatments when unwanted by patients. Avoiding nonbeneficial/unwanted care becomes especially important in times of stress on healthcare capacity. Furthermore, nonbeneficial/unwanted care puts other patients, family, and healthcare workers at greater transmission risk. For patients in a community setting or nursing home, clinicians should engage in goals-of-care discussions now. Patients with chronic life-limiting illnesses should be offered the option to complete a physician order for life-sustaining treatments form, especially if they would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or mechanical ventilation. This pandemic heightens the importance of implementing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders for appropriate patients: although unwanted/nonbeneficial CPR always risks increasing psychological distress for patients' families, inappropriate CPR now is especially stressful and potentially dangerous for healthcare workers. Nonbeneficial/unwanted advanced cardiac life support will strain available personal protective equipment. During this pandemic, in extreme situations, there may be a role for clinicians unilaterally deciding to write DNR orders to reduce the risk of medically futile CPR. Lastly, informed assent (vs. informed consent) provides family members a way to agree with the clinician's determination without assuming decision-making responsibility.Commentary: Traditionally, the approach to advance care planning is informed consent relying on the central tenants of patient autonomy and shared decision making, with the goal of ensuring medical care is consistent with patients' values, goals, and preferences. 4 In extreme circumstances, like pandemics, informed assent has been suggested as permissible. 5 The intent of unilateral decision making has been attributed to removing undue burden from patients/families. 6, 7 However, it is controversial because it suggests patients' values can be bypassed. 6 Although the current proposed model addresses patients' values as the starting point, it could more clearly note that informed assent must be grounded in patient values. 8Bottom Line: The COVID-19 pandemic has created unusual, resource-scarce circumstances in which informed assent of DNR orders may be justified. However, its use should be limited by using informed consent for as long as possible, using informed assent only as necessary, and identifying patients' values to inform every decision.Reviewer: Ambereen K.
