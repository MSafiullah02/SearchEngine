The Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) recommends that elderly persons aged 65 years or above, young children aged six months to five years, those with chronic heart and lung diseases and persons with diabetes mellitus or renal diseases, who are at a higher risk of developing complications from influenza [10], to undergo routine annual flu vaccination [11]. Seasonal influenza vaccination has also been shown to reduce infection and absenteeism among HCWs [9]. Despite this recommendation, and free vaccine offered by healthcare organisations, the vaccination rates among HCWs have remained low in many countries [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",
