The disease represents a diagnostic and management dilemma to clinicians [3] and is associated with significant mortality in patients [4]. Acinetobacter strains, once considered a low-category pathogen, have become an important etiology of VAP in ICUs worldwide [5, 6]. Patients with serious comorbidities that need mechanical ventilation can become infected with antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter spp., representing a therapeutic challenge [7, 8]. There is a paucity of information on VAP due to Acinetobacter spp. Thus, we performed this prospective-observational multicenter study, and described the course, prognostic factors, and outcomes of VAP due to Acinetobacter spp.",

Variables with more than 30% missing value between all candidate predictors were dropped according to the White et al.\u2019s proposed rule of thumb. In this rule, the number of imputations used was matched to the proportion of missing data [14]. We applied the \u201cthe missing completely at random\u201d (MCAR) procedure for the missing data to define missing mechanisms of variables for either dropping or imputing before performing multiple imputation for the cases and columns < 30% [15]. The hypothesis of MCAR was rejected at the 0.05 level by the normality test; therefore, dropping the missing observations would produce biased estimates. We imputed the missing observations 20 times. We also generated a complete dataset by aggregating the set of twenty imputations to the medians [16].",

Multiple cultures were positive for Acinetobacter spp. in 37 (21%) patients. The AST results of Acinetobacter spp. are presented in Table 2. In total, 136 MDR (76.8%), 38 XDR (21.5%), 1 PDR, and 2 susceptible strains were recovered. When the patients were evaluated according to AST data, 69 (39%) initially received appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment.III.Overall assessment (28th day of appropriate antimicrobial treatment)Outcome: On the 28th day of follow-up assessment, 89 (50.3%) patients had died. The median time to death (IQR) was 10 (7\u201316) days.Drug modification: During the 28-day period, antibiotics were modified in 14 patients on the 3rd day of assessment and it was modified on the 7th day in 16 patients. In 3 cases, modification was made in both timings reaching a sum of 27 on the whole. Hence, crude mortality was 48% (n = 72) in patients without modification and it was 63% (n = 17) with modification.Antibiotic dosing: During the 28-day period, a CMS loading dose (300 mg) was given in 21 of 150 (14%). Renal dose adjustment was made in 23 patients on the 3rd day of assessment while redosing was made on the 7th day in 15 patients. In 5 patients, dose adjustment was made in both timings reaching a total of 38. Hence, crude mortality was 45.8% (n = 66) in patients without adjustment and it was 70% (n = 23) with modification.Prognostic assessment: Table 3 shows the parameters associated with mortality in univariate analyses and final logistic regression model. Consequently, appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment (OR, 0.445 (95% CI 0.216\u20130.914); p = 0.027), surgical operations performed in the last month (OR, 0.137 (95% CI 0.037\u20130.499); p = 0.003), fever (OR, 0.663 (95% CI: 0.454\u20130.967); p = 0.033), creatinine levels (OR, 1.84 (95% CI 1.279\u20132.657); p = 0.001), malignancy (OR, 7.095 (95% CI 2.142\u201323.500); p = 0.001), and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.341 (95% CI 1.046\u20135.239); p = 0.038) at the start of antibiotics were significantly associated with mortality.

After 1 month of follow-up, half of the cases with VAP due to Acinetobacter spp. died in this study. The magnitude of the problem indicates the need for optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of these infections. We report that therapeutic options were quite limited and involved serious toxicities for patients with VAP due to Acinetobacter spp. In addition, the use of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy contributed to survival of patients along with recent surgery and fever. We hypothesize that a high fever favors a robust immunity, and surgical operation in the last month as an acute disorder without permanent chronic conditions. In contrast, renal insufficiency indicated by high creatinine levels considering the nephrotoxic potential of CMS, the backbone of therapy, or comorbid conditions like congestive heart failure and malignancy significantly contributed to a poor prognosis.",

            "text": "Although carbapenem resistance differs throughout the world being less common in high-income countries [8], more than 95% of Acinetobacter isolates were resistant to carbapenems in our study. Interestingly, although inappropriate antibiotic treatment contributed to mortality, we could not show a difference between XDR and MDR strains for survival. CMS seemed to be the major option in the management of the disease followed by tigecycline as a potential alternative. When carbapenem resistance exceeds 20% in a given community, then empiric CMS combination with a carbapenem (other than ertapenem), tigecycline, or sulbactam is advocated [18]. However, tigecycline has limitations due to low plasma levels limiting its use in bacteremias [19]. Accordingly, the use of tigecycline in VAP was shown to be hampered in a phase III randomized controlled trial disclosing higher mortality in the tigecycline arm [20]. Under these peculiar circumstances, what should the treating clinicians do when our data are considered? Should CMS-based regimens be given to all VAP patients as empirical treatment? This controversy is also reflected in our study since the physicians prescribed CMS-based regimens empirically in 11.5% of the cases while CMS was prescribed in 87.2% of the patients following AST results. Although we have disclosed that appropriate treatment contributed to survival in this study, empirical CMS use will surely result in the rapid loss of the unique option. No concrete answer seemingly exists for this dilemma even in the guidelines [21]. One potential resolution may be to use rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Cultures were taken after the start of antibiotics in 9% of our cases and it took a median of 2 days to yield AST data. These obvious delays indicate the necessity of RDTs in routine medical practice like multiplex real-time PCR or MALDI-TOF MS [18]. Considering the limitations and since most RDTs have not been validated for respiratory secretions, they should be better used together with conventional culture systems. Furthermore, antibiotic stewardship can improve survival [18, 22].",

When the initial antibiotic therapies were evaluated according to subsequent AST data, three-fifths of the patients did not receive appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment. After the modification of therapy after the availability of AST results, problems related to drug side effects and clinical worsening arose. In fact, patients were prone to two types of drug modification: one due to AST results, and the second due to drug side effects. Hence, VAP prevention should become a core measure and VAP prevention bundles should be implemented [23].

First, we did not have the minimum inhibitor concentration values of all infecting Acinetobacter strains. Second, there could be propensity bias as treatment of patients was not randomized. Third, since the study had an observational design, it was not possible to reach a sufficient number of cases in order to analyze each independent factor that could affect the course of Acinetobacter-induced VAP.
