Droplet transmission from human to human is another usual mode of spread of the pulmonary infection, especially in immunocompetent patients and young children. Clearance by mucociliary system can filter infective organisms 5-10 nm in diameter, so that microorganisms between 1 and 2 nm can reach the alveolar tissue. The alveolar infection depends on the balance between the virulence of the microorganism and body defenses due to cellular phagocytosis. There are several factors predisposing to the development of CAP as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, uremia, immunodeficiency, obstructive pulmonary chronic disorders with mucociliary clearance insufficiency, and age. Alcoholic patients and people with poor oral hygiene are particularly sensitive to develop pulmonary infections (Barlettand Finegold 1974) .",

The ensuing bronchiolitis and alveolitis are characterized by infiltration of the epithelium with mononuclear cells and presence of neutrophilic exudate in the lumen of the airways. These changes are predominantly seen in the terminal and respiratory bronchioles and manifest radiologically as peribronchial nodules (M\u00fcller et al. 2007; M\u00fcller 2003) . Bronchiolitis with exudate in the lumen of the airways is seen on radiographs as reticulonodular pattern and on CT as tree-in-bud nodules. As the nodules enlarge, they involve the entire secondary pulmonary lobule and are seen as \"lobular\" consolidation: these features are typical of bronchopneumonia pattern. Further extension into segmental and patchy lobar consolidation may be seen in advanced stages, and this may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial infection. Partial filling of the airways gives rise to ground-glass opacities (M\u00fcller et al. 2007) .",

M. tuberculosis is an obligate aerobic, nonsporing, nonmotile bacillus. Its cell wall is rich in mycolic acid, accounting for its staining properties. It resists staining by the usual Gram method, being neither Gram negative or positive. When stained with dyes such as Ziehl-Neelsen, it resists decolorization by the acid alcohol and is therefore called acid fast.

But if the macrophage is not able to contain the infection or the bacillus is highly virulent, MTB multiplies multifold before the macrophage bursts. Release of various cytokines by the macrophages attracts further macrophages which phagocytose the released MTB (Knechel 2009 ). In the first 2-3 weeks, development of T cell-mediated immunity causes activation of macrophages which then destroy the MTB within them (van Crevel et al. 2002) . This causes the formation of a typical granuloma with a caseation necrosis in the lungs and the draining lymph nodes. This attributes to the typical imaging features in primary TB.

As a result of the formation of this communication with airways, air enters the lung parenchyma in this area of consolidation, forming what is a typical lesion of the secondary TB, that is, a cavity. As the contents of the cavity are discharged into the bronchus, the patient develops cough with expectoration. Spread of these discharges into the airways may also give rise to typical imaging appearance of endobronchial spread.

Complete obstruction of the lumen manifests as segmental or lobar collapse of the distal lung (Andreu et al. 2004 ).

In extensive bronchogenic spread, a typical tree-in-bud appearance is described, the stalk represents the distal airways, and the bud represents alveolar ducts and bronchioles, which are filled with caseous material.

In posttreatment changes with development of distortion of bronchovascular structure, fibrotic bands in areas of caseous necrosis are well established.
