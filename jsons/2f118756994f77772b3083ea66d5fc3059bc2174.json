            "text": "Mannose-binding lectins (MBLs), an important component of innate immunity, are acutephase plasma collections that recognize repetitive sugar arrays present on many pathogens but not on mammalian cells (8, 9) . Binding of MBL to various micro-organisms activates complement by the lectin-pathway, which finally leads to opsonization and lysis of pathogens and recruitment of inflammatory cells (10) . Due to polymorphisms within the MBL2 gene and the associated promotor region, MBL serum concentrations show a wide variability (11) (12) (13) . MBL deficiency is common with approximately 30% of the white population having reduced and 5-10% having very low MBL concentrations (10) . MBL does not cross the placental barrier and the infant\u00d5s cord blood MBL concentration correlates well with the individual MBL level later in life (14, 15) . MBL has repeatedly been postulated to play an important role in modulating susceptibility to respiratory tract infections during infancy (8, 10, 16) , although data are partially conflicting (14, (17) (18) (19) (20) . In a prospective population-based cohort study, MBL deficient children experienced significantly more acute respiratory tract infections (21) . On the contrary, several recent papers have shown associations between high MBL levels and asthma (14, (22) (23) (24) . Interpretation of the available reports on MBL and respiratory symptoms in infants is hampered, since most studies did not adjust for known risk factors for respiratory disease such as atopy and environmental factors (19) .",

Mothers of 172 (93%) children reported one or more weeks with wheeze or cough, with a median (range) of 4 (0-23) wk. Severe symptoms occurred in 81 (44%) infants, at a median (range) of 0 (0-6) wk and wheeze was present in 41 (22%) infants, with median (range) of 0 (0-10) wk. Four infants were hospitalized for respiratory reasons. The distribution of cord blood MBL levels is given in Fig. 1 . Anthropometric data and presence of known risk factors for respiratory disease during infancy are given in Table 2 according to cord blood MBL levels in the low, middle and high tertile. One child without a history of pre-natal smoke exposure was regarded as being exposed to pre-natal tobacco smoke because elevated urine cotinine levels (93 ng/ml) suggested significant pre-natal nicotine exposure.",

Only sparse data, however, are available on the association between high MBL levels and respiratory symptoms, mainly based on studies about asthma in older children and adults (14, (22) (23) (24) . We therefore further analysed the role of high cord blood MBL levels using stratification for parental asthma. We found that in infants of parents without asthma, MBL levels in the high tertile were not associated with an increased risk of respiratory symptoms (IRR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.81-1.53; p = 0.49 for total respiratory symptoms; IRR = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.88-2.82; p = 0.13 for severe respiratory symptoms). In contrast, in infants of asthmatic parents (mother and/or father), MBL levels in the high tertile were Fig. 3 ). Similar findings were obtained for stratification by maternal or paternal asthmatic disease. No effect modifica-tion was found for paternal atopy as assessed by questionnaire or maternal atopy as assessed by skin prick test for six common respiratory allergens. Nasal swabs for virological analysis were available from 93 infants at the time of the first acute respiratory tract infection, and one or more viruses were identified in 71 (75%) cases. No association between MBL levels and viral aetiology or age at onset of the first acute respiratory tract infection was found (Fig. 4 ).",

Sensitivity analysis focussing on infants with very low MBL levels [<100 ng/ ml (18, 20) ] confirmed these results. Currently available evidence concerning the role of MBL deficiency on respiratory infections in children is inconclusive (19) and arises mainly from hospital-based or case control studies (16, 18, 20) . Koch et al. (21) have published a prospective population-based cohort study in Greenlandic children below two 2-yr of age and reported a twofold-increased risk of acute respiratory infections for MBL-deficient children. A recent welldesigned large prospective German study (17) on MBL genotypes in 749 children could not confirm this finding.

Since MBL-mediated opsonization and direct lysis of pathogens have primarily been demonstrated for bacteria (9, 10) , it may be argued that MBL deficiency plays a minor role in modulating susceptibility towards common respiratory infections (31) during infancy, which are mainly of viral origin. Furthermore, redundancy within innate immunity such as antibody-mediated activation of the classical pathway of complement may compensate for MBL deficiency (32) . Since our study addressed lower respiratory tract symptoms in a healthy population with a low incidence of hospitalizations, we cannot comment on the role of MBL deficiency in predominantly bacterial infections such as pneumonia or otitis media (11) . MBL-mediated immunity might indeed be more relevant in the context of invasive bacterial infections (33, 34) .",

            "text": "Infants with high cord blood MBL levels suffered more often from respiratory symptoms, which represents a novel finding. Subset analysis revealed that high MBL levels were particularly relevant if at least one of the parents suffered from asthma. Notably, infants of parents with asthma did not overall have higher MBL levels than infants of non-asthmatic parents, which would be expected if the rise in MBL was caused primarily by a pro-inflammatory in utero environment. Several authors have reported elevated MBL levels in patients with asthma (14, (22) (23) (24) 35) , whereas studies based solely on genotyping MBL deficiency found no association with asthma (17, 36, 37) . Recently, a novel intronic Fig. 3 . Association between cord blood MBL levels and severe respiratory symptoms according to parental asthma. The incidence rate ratio (number) and 95% CI for weeks with severe respiratory symptoms during the first year of life are given stratified for parental (e.g. maternal and/or paternal) asthmatic disease, adjusted for all risk factors listed in the methods section. single nucleotide polymorphism within the MBL2 gene, associated with high MBL levels, peripheral blood eosinophilia and asthma severity, has been identified (23) . Since most studies (14, (22) (23) (24) 35 ) measured MBL at a time when asthma had already been diagnosed, chronic inflammation could have caused the rise in MBL. In contrast, our results demonstrate that high cord blood MBL levels precede respiratory symptoms in infants of asthmatic parents. Thus, MBL may act as a disease-modifier: when an asthmatic genetic background is present, high MBL levels may be either causative or represent a side-phenomenon of an inflammatory process leading to increased respiratory symptoms. Considering that MBL activates the complement system, representing one of the most potent inflammatory cascades (38) , it seems plausible that high MBL levels favour complement-mediated inflammation (13, 39) . No effect modification was found for atopy. This is in line with several studies who have failed to show associations between MBL and atopy (17, 37) .",

Contrary to previous studies (16, 18, 20, 21) , we assessed well-known risk factors for respiratory disease and could therefore obtain carefully adjusted estimates of the impact of MBL cord blood levels. Weekly standardized phone calls to the parents allowed us to prospectively assess respiratory morbidity during infancy in detail. Although we studied unselected healthy infants, participants were likely to be biased towards a predominantly white middle class origin, with a high proportion of asthmatic parents and a low proportion of smoking parents as discussed in detail previously (3) . This might have affected the incidence of respiratory symptoms, but is unlikely to have influenced the association between symptoms and MBL.",

In otherwise healthy term infants, environmental and genetic factors other than MBL deficiency may be more relevant for determining susceptibility to common respiratory infections (31) , which are mainly of viral origin. In contrast, high cord blood MBL levels were significantly associated with increased respiratory morbidity during the first year of life, especially in offspring of asthmatic parents. The strength of this association was comparable to known risk factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or day-care attendance. Innate immunity mechanisms thus need to be considered as important determinants for pulmonary disease. In addition to the principal function of recognizing microbial pathogens, MBL may modify how an individual reacts to an infectious or allergen challenge (24) . Contrary to surfactant proteins A and D, which possess a high structural similarity to MBL (8), the biological role of MBL in bronchoalveolar fluids has received little attention (40) . Future studies should therefore address the presence of MBL on airway surfaces and its implications in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as asthma.",
