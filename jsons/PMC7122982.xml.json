            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1]. Since its emergence, MERS-CoV has infected more than 2280 individuals with over 800 deaths in 27 countries around the world, with the majority of the infections occurring in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is classified as a lineage C betacoronavirus (Beta-CoV ). Beta-CoV is one of four genera of the coronaviruses of the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae [2]. In addition to MERS-CoV, the Beta-CoV genus also contains the SARS-CoV (lineage B), and other human coronaviruses such as OC43 and HKU1 (lineage A) [2]. Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses with a large positive-sense, single-stranded genome that ranges in size from 28 to 32 kbp and characterized by having crown-like projections on the virus particles [3]. The genome of the MERS-CoV is about 30.1 kbp long and contains 11 open reading frames (ORFs ). Like other coronaviruses, the first two-thirds of the MERS-CoV genome contains two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, that encode the viral replicase-transcriptase complex, the nonstructural proteins 1\u201316 (nsp1\u201316). The remaining one-third of the genome comprises ORFs that encodes the structural proteins, which include the spike (S ), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition to these structural and nonstructural proteins shared by other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV genome also contains several ORFs coding for accessory proteins, namely ORF3, ORF4a, and ORF4b [4].",

Mice are the most common and accessible laboratory animal species used for biomedical research in general. However, due to the disparity of two amino acids in the viral receptor\u2014dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)\u2014from the human sequence that are critical for efficient binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD ) of MERS-CoV, wild-type mice are not naturally permissive to MERS-CoV [5, 6]. We have recently developed a transgenic (Tg) mouse model, expressing the human DPP4, that is highly permissive to MERS-CoV infection and disease [7, 8]. The quantification of MERS-CoV RNA in specimens is important for studying MERS pathogenesis, evaluating the efficacy of selected MCMs and diagnostics. In this protocol, we outlined a stepwise RT-qPCR-based protocol to unequivocal quantify MERS-CoV-specific RNAs within the lungs of infected hDPP4 Tg mice.",

This protocol can be followed to detect viral RNA in these tissues as well.In the protocol, we use one-step RT-qPCR without the need for separate reaction for cDNA synthesis, which is quick and simple. However, creating a cDNA first can be done and used for qPCR, especially if there is a need to stock cDNA to quantify other targets.For multiple samples, prepare a master mix and add an appropriate volume to the plate wells, followed by adding the RNA template. Master mix preparation is crucial to reduce pipetting errors.Alternatively, the viral RNA titer can be represented as TCID50 eq/gram of tissue as detailed in Subheading 3.5.More aliquots could be prepared to make higher range standard curve by spiking with higher concentrations of MERS-CoV.\n",
