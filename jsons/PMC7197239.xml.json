            "text": "Coronaviruses are known to infect humans as well as animals. These viruses are classified in four genera named as alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltacornavirus. Alpha- and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals, whereas gamma- and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds. Out of seven known human Coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E belong to the genus alphacoronavirus; whereas remaining five belong to genus betacoronavirus. These include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS, MERS and CoV-2 which is the causative agent of COVID-19. The SARS and MERS Coronaviruses are no longer circulating in humans; however the other four human Coronaviruses had been circulating and are known to cause common cold [22]. Both SARS and MERS Coronaviruses originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via an intermediary host. For SARS, the intermediate host was Himalayan palm civet, whereas for MERS it was dromedary camels [19]. Subsequent studies have shown that bats are host to more than 500 species of Coronaviruses. However, nothing is known regarding the wild animal host or any intermediate host for CoV-2 which is the cause of current ongoing pandemic. SARS emerged in year 2002 and caused an epidemic that resulted in about 8000 infections with almost 10% case fatality rate, whereas MERS epidemic resulted in more than 2500 infections with approximately 34% case fatality rate thereby becoming the most pathogenic of all human Coronaviruses. The ongoing CoV-2 pandemic has so far infected more than 3 million people worldwide causing death of more than 200,000 people with case fatality rate of approximately 7% making it the deadliest of all Coronaviruses.",

Like all enveloped viruses, coronavirus envelope is also derived from host cell into which several viral coded proteins are embedded. These include spike protein (S) which is a classic class I fusion protein important for entry of virus in susceptible cells, and envelope protein (E) which is important for virus assembly. Inside the envelope there is another membrane glycoprotein called matrix protein (M) which connects the virus envelope to nucleocapsid and is also important for virus assembly [2]. The crystal stricture of S protein of CoV-2 has been solved recently. The protein consists of two major domains- the \u2018receptor binding\u2019 domain and \u2018fusion machinery\u2019 domain. The aminoacid residues in receptor binding domain are highly variable, whereas the residues in fusion machinery domain are more conserved. Embedded deep inside the fusion machinery domain is the \u2018fusion peptide\u2019 which is important for fusion of viral membrane with host membrane [21].",

            "text": "During attachment and entry process, the S protein of CoV-2 interacts with cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Then cellular protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the S protein through a two stage cleavage process. The first cleavage event allows cellular protease TMPRSS2 to cleave the receptor binding domain of S protein thereby allowing its fusion subunit to form a hairpin which is embedded in membrane of target cell via fusion peptide of S protein. In second stage, the fusion peptide is activated. The fusion peptide consists of a sequence of hydrophobic aminoacids which allows it to be embedded in host cell membrane. Subsequent folding of this hairpin then allows the viral envelope to come in very close proximity to host cell membrane culminating in their fusion leading to release of viral nucleocapsid in to the cytoplasm of host cell [10]. This process occurs either at plasma membrane or through endosomal membrane. Previous studies have shown that there are six amino-acids which are present in receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS CoV which are critical for binding to cellular receptor ACE2. A recent study has now shown that five out of these six amino-acids are different in CoV-2 when compared to SARS-CoV. However the S protein of CoV-2 can still interact very efficiently with ACE2 receptor in host cell. In addition, the sequence analysis of S protein of CoV-2 has shown that it has also acquired a \u2018polybasic cleavage site\u2019 consisting of 12 aminoacids that has been predicted to enable its cleavage by other cellular proteases including furin [1]. In many other viruses including Influenza virus, the acquisition of similar polybasic site in viral envelope protein has been known to be associated with their increased transmissibility. It is not yet known if the presence of \u2018polybasic cleavage site\u2019 in S protein plays a similar role in CoV-2 pathogenesis.",

The largest ORF is called ORF1 which is present towards 5\u2032 end of its genome and codes for a long polyprotein which is subsequently cleaved into multiple non-structural proteins (NSP). The remaining 13 ORFs are all present towards 3\u2032 half of the genome and code for structural and accessory proteins [23]. The ORF1 is translated directly from the positive sense viral genomic RNA to make a polyprotein which also includes two proteases which cleave the polyprotein into the individual proteins. However, due to the presence of a stop codon in middle of ORF1, only the first half of polyprotein can be translated before translation terminates at this stop codon. This results in synthesis of partial polyprotein. Approximately half the time, the translation is able to proceed past the stop codon resulting in synthesis of full length polypprotein. This occurs due to the presence of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence around this stop codon, and a RNA pseudoknot structure downstream of the stop codon. These features of Coronavirus genome causes the ribosome to pause and allows it to occasionally slip out of frame resulting in frameshifting. This frameshifting event during translation allows the ribosome to read through the stop codon resulting in full length polyprotein to be synthesized approximately half of the time [8, 16].",

All these sub-genomic RNAa also have same 5\u2032 end leader (L) sequence as in genomic RNA. A peculiar feature of Coronavirus genome is the presence of a series of conserved sequences called \u2018transcription regulatory sequences\u2019 (TRS) which are present at junction between each of these ORFs as well as at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA downstream of the leader (L) sequence. During the process of copying the genome when the polymerase reaches these TRSs, the structural properties of these sequences allows the polymerase to either continue copying the RNA or to jump from that TRS sequence to pair with TRS sequence down at 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA downstream of the leader (L) sequence. This occurs by a process called \u2018discontinuous transcription\u2019. This results in generation of sub-genomic negative sense RNAs which are then used as template by same polymersase to generate positive sense sub-genomic mRNAs. Even though these sub-genomic mRNAs consist of multiple ORFs, all the ORFs do not get translated as polyproteins. Only the first ORF from the 5\u2032 end of these sub-genomic RNAs get translated to synthesize individual viral protein, and the remaining ORFs remains untranslated [16]. The polymerase jumping events associated with discontinuous transcription also results in high recombination rates in Coronaviruses.",

The polymerase holoenzyme is made of nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 subunits, and is capable of initiating de novo primer independent RNA synthesis. These subunits are also associated with nsp14 which plays key role in capping of viral subgenomic mRNAs. The nsp14 also has exonuclease activity that is critical for possible proofreading function in coronaviruses, a property which is missing in other RNA viruses. A variety of other viral processing proteins and activities are also associated with viral replicase complex [11]. The absence of proofreading activity in polymerases of RNA viruses has put a theoretical limit of approximately 30 Kb on genome size of RNA viruses due to constraints of evolution. However, the presence of exonuclease activity of nsp14 in Coronaviruses may be conferring the proof reading ability to RNA polymerase of these viruses thereby allowing them to cross the threshold and have genome sizes even above 30 Kb [15]. Studies performed on SARS-CoV have shown that mutation in its exonuclease gene results in 20-fold increase in mutation frequency as compared to the wild type virus [14]. The nsp14 protein is a bimodular protein which is composed of two domains: the ExoN domain for proofreading activity and N7-MTase domain for mRNA capping activity [13]. It has been shown that the exonuclease activity of nsp14 can efficiently excise the nucleoside analog chain terminator ribavirin thereby rendering this antiviral drug of no use against Coronaviruses [4].",

They also help the virus to concentrate the factors necessary for efficient transcription and replication of viral genome. The integral membrane proteins that are part of replicase complex play an important role in genesis of these vesicles. These include nsp3, nsp 4 and nsp6 which are directly involved in vesicle formation. Exogenous expression of nsp3 and nsp4 alone in a cell has been shown to be sufficient for formation of these vesicles indicating their crucial role in this process [7].

These include the proteins involved in vesicular trafficking pathways, in ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related processes, and the translation initiation factors. The proteome also include most of non-structural proteins coded by virus as well. One of the viral coded proteins which are not detected in RTC microenvironment is nsp1 [20]. The nsp1 is a coronavirus pathogenicity factor that restricts host gene expression by directly interacting with 40S subunit of host ribosome and restricting translation of host mRNAs. It also mediates endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs leading to extensive mRNA degradation in infected cells [24]. This results in hijacking of host translation machinery allowing it to be used exclusively for viral protein synthesis. The nsp1 does not act on viral transcripts as the leader sequence at 5\u2032 end of viral mRNAs protects it from action of nsp1 [9]. In addition to nsp1, several other virus coded accessory proteins are not present in RTC microenvironment. These genes are usually dispensable for replication of virus in cell culture system, however they play an important role in virus host interaction in infected animals or humans [5]. CoV-2 and SARS CoV have a similar set of accessory genes with some differences among the interferon antagonists [23]. The function of most of the accessory genes of SARS CoV as well as CoV-2 has not been elucidated till date.",

The virus is able to inhibit early interferon response of host against virus very efficiently. SARS pathogenesis has been shown to be linked to delayed IFN-1 signaling and subsequent immune toxicity. Experiments performed in IFN receptor knockout mice have shown that all of these mice can survive SARS-CoV infection whereas 80% of the wild type mice died indicating that IFN response is directly linked to pathogenesis of disease [3]. The delay in IFN response allows the virus to replicate to high titer after infecting the host. The delayed IFN response is subsequently unable to stop the virus infection; however it drives aberrant recruitment of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages and activation of innate immune response leading to extensive cytotoxicity. A model proposed for SARS pathogenesis suggests that during acute virus infection, the cells in lung alveoli undergo rapid virus replication without any early IFN response. This result in inflammatory cells infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from infected cells as well as from the infiltrating cells. These immune responses lead to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [6].",

The current CoV-2 pandemic is still ongoing and efforts are on to control it. Since the wild animal reservoirs for CoV-2 are yet to be identified, therefore it is possible that virus may again undergo animal to human transmission in future. Moreover, there has been widespread community transmission of CoV-2 in multiple countries all over the world. The problem has been further compounded by transmission of CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers thereby making it extremely difficult to undertake contact tracing and breaking the chain of human to human transmission. A better understanding of molecular virology of COV-2 can help in formulating strategies for vaccine and anti-viral therapeutics development in immediate future.",
