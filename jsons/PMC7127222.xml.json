With some doubts in mind, I went to obtain a chest x-ray film for myself on Tuesday.

In the evening after admission, I started to have a persistently high temperature reaching 39.8\u00b0C despite intravenous clarithromycin and cefotaxime.

Retrospectively, however, such a preemptive move obviously augmented the chance of cross-infection among us. Exactly 24 hours later, I had to be transferred to our ICU from this observation ward because my condition worsened. The previous two antibiotics were replaced with levofloxacin, but my high fever was unaffected. Hydrocortisone and an antiviral agent, ribavirin, were then administered in the evening. Although the use of steroids and ribavirin in treating SARS still remains controversial, it appeared somewhat beneficial in my case because my body temperature returned to normal 12 hours later and never increased thereafter. Nevertheless, my respiratory function continued to deteriorate in the next few days. Even with a 100% oxygen mask, my saturation could only barely reach 94%. I tried my very best to stay away from mechanical ventilation, even though such an option was seriously considered on a daily basis by my ICU colleagues for most of my remaining stay in the unit.",

Patients with immediate life-threatening diseases, such as critical coronary artery disease and lung cancer, had to be transferred to outside hospitals for treatment.

When most people thought the present medical advances had triumphed over infection, SARS bluntly reminded us that this is not the case. The current avian flu epidemic is another good case in point. No doubt there is an urgent need for heightened global awareness and alertness, and we must get ready for other new and emerging infectious diseases. Ideally, history will not repeat itself if we stick to the policy of early detection and reporting, quick verification and isolation, and effective treatment and containment.9, 10, 11\n",
