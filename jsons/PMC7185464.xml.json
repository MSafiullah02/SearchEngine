Serum and/or plasma also offers the option of longitudinal sampling and monitoring of individuals which may also lead to the detection of disease in patients who are asymptomatic or have early stage disease. Serum represents the soluble fraction of blood that remains following the clotting process, and thus is considered to be a more simplified matrix than plasma, which contains all soluble blood borne factors, including clotting factors. While serum is thought to be less complex than plasma, and thus the probability of identifying novel proteins may be increased, the clotting process is not uniform (unlike the preparation of plasma), and may also lead to the loss of novel factors which remain bound to the insoluble protein clot [4].",

This can be determined by ionisation of a sample to generate charged species which depending on their m/z value will reach the detector at a specific time (time of flight, ToF mass analyser), or by \u2018trapping\u2019 the ions in an electric field and then sequentially filtering them out based on size (smallest first) and measuring the time at which they arrive at the detector. In order to generate peptides that are small enough to be efficiently ionised the sample must be digested with trypsin prior to MS analysis. Because trypsin cleaves proteins at specific amino acid residues these m/z values can then be searched against a database of cleavage products (of known m/z values) in order to generate a \u2018peptide mass fingerprint\u2019. Protein sequence information can be more accurately achieved by MS/MS analysis. As previously described, ionised peptides are selected based upon their m/z value, however, once all the other ions have been filtered out, they are then induced to fragment by collision with an inert gas, such as argon or nitrogen. This causes fragmentation of the peptide along the peptide backbone in a highly predictable manner, and thus the time at which these fragments (with particular m/z values) reach the detector allows identification of the peptide/protein sequence.",

Indeed, due to the heterogeneous nature of human beings and their diseases, a panel of biomarkers rather than a single marker may be required to achieve the high sensitivity and specificity required for clinical applications [14]. With particular regard to oncology, most studies to date have involved patients with advanced disease, and given that genomic studies indicate that the molecular composition of early and late stage tumours can be different, the hope that these signatures will translate to early stage pre-invasive lesions where there are no reliable diagnostic tools may prove to be too simplistic [1].",

Provided that the label imparts a sufficient mass difference between these two peptide forms, their relative abundance may be calculated by comparing their respective signal intensities in the same MS run [15]. Mass tags can be incorporated in a variety of ways, either metabolically, chemically or enzymically.

Systematic errors (sample loading, HPLC retention times and MS instrument performance) are minimised by normalisation of peak intensities over the entire run [16] and ion suppression effects are countered for by the use of internal standard peptides included in each run at equal concentrations [17]. Alternatively, the spectral counting approach [18], [19], [20] uses data acquired in MS/MS mode to count and identify the number of fragment spectra that identify peptides of a given protein.

This then necessitates the acquisition of many spectra in order to accurately quantitate levels of any given protein, and as a result low abundance proteins can be difficult to identify and accurately quantify [16]. Meanwhile, saturation of the detector will occur at higher spectral counts, again with different levels for different proteins, in turn leading to potential problems with dynamic range [15].

One approach is to combine spectral counting to give accurate fold changes with peptide ion intensity measurements using standard peptides to correct for variations in signal (ion abundance) [16], [22]. An additional method, known as spectral feature analysis has recently been developed whereby quantitative and qualitative information can be gathered by aligning and comparing LC\u2013MS datasets without the initial need for MS/MS analysis [23]. The increased costs and processing times associated with labelling have meant that label free techniques have generally been considered advantageous in their application to large scale clinical proteomics. However, the introduction of 8-plex iTRAQ reagents may enhance throughput for this technique compared to other methods. Furthermore, label free techniques are generally considered inferior in their quantification accuracy when compared to methods relying upon stable isotopes [15]. In particular, an early study conducted by Petricoin et al. [24] used surface enhanced laser desorption ionisation (SELDI) (a label free approach) to identify a proteomic signature associated with ovarian cancer, however, this study was later disregarded as the results were not reproducible and found to be most likely due to variables introduced during sample processing [25], [26].",

For example, detection of low abundance ions will be obscured by the background noise, or quantification may be prevented by saturation of the detector. Although for quantification in MS/MS mode saturation is rarely a problem, however, in all cases true low abundance peptides may lead to poor quantification due to poor ion statistics (which define the sensitivity of detection; at high data acquisition rates fewer ions entering the mass spectrometer are allocated to the generation of each spectrum, leading to increased signal:noise ratios and low abundance peptides may not be identified) [15]. These factors coupled with the qualities of the label (if a label is used) mean that optimisation of peptide/protein ID and quantification must be achieved by decreasing the sample complexity prior to MS. Decreasing the sample complexity by fractionation (although overall analysis time will be increased) means that a greater number of peptides will be potentially analysed as more MS time will be committed to each one.",

As 2D-PAGE can only separate proteins in the mass range of 10\u2013300 kDa it can be considered complimentary to other techniques, such as SELDI-ToF (discussed later) as this proteomic method can only be used to identify proteins below 20 kDa in size [29]. However, the presence of highly abundant serum/plasma proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulins are a major challenge for the success of 2D-PAGE\u2013MS in the identification of differentially regulated proteins from clinically relevant bio-fluids such as these [30]. These abundant proteins result in large smears that mask lower abundance proteins [31], and thus depletion of these highly abundant proteins prior to 2D-PAGE is essential.

Because of the isobaric nature of iTRAQ-labelled peptides this allows the signal from all peptides to be summed in both MS and MS/MS modes thus enhancing the sensitivity of detection. This potential benefit to identify and quantify low abundance proteins in complex samples, coupled with the ability to multiplex up to eight samples in parallel [54] (unlike ICAT, which is limited to two labelled samples per run) suggests that iTRAQ holds the most promise for quantitative biomarker discovery.",

It is imperative that sample processing should not affect the outcome of any analyses and that the chosen platform should be robust and reliable, thus reducing detrimental effects introduced by experimental variables. Label free quantification methods are favourable in practical terms as they are relatively high-throughput, requiring no time-consuming and expensive labelling step. Consequently there is no theoretical limit to the number of samples that can be analysed in any given experiment, as it is not restricted by the number of labels available. However, unlike isotope labelling methods, label free approaches do not allow for sample multiplexing, and thus may not be faster. In addition, lack of topoisomeric peptides reduces the spectral complexity at any given chromatographic time, potentially increasing the number of peptides identified, although again this is not true of isobaric tagging reagents such as iTRAQ. Although there is evidence that label free methods show increased dynamic range of quantification over stable isotope labelling, label free methods are particularly susceptible to error, and there is inconclusive data regarding the accuracy and linearity of label free techniques [16].",

In this method, proteins are not identified but signature peak patterns are derived and compared between test groups to generate a proteomic profile. The primary example of this type of method is SELDI-ToF whereby samples such as serum, plasma and urine can be applied to chromatographic chips designed to enrich for different populations of protein/peptide analyte. Consequently, the main advantage of this technique is ease of use and apparent throughput, a possible reason as to why this method is so heavily used in clinical proteomics, particularly in comparison to other MS-based proteomics approaches [63].",

A classic example of this is an early study by Petricoin et al. [24], whereby a biomarker signature for ovarian cancer determined by SELDI was subsequently found to be not reproducible and the differences were proposed to be due to variables introduced during sample processing [64], [65]. In addition, the reproducibility and inter-lab variability of SELDI to detect a three peak signature identified to detect prostate cancer was tested by six independent laboratories, and the inter-lab coefficients of variation of the normalised peak intensities were found to be between 15-36% [66].",

SELDI has also been used to identify biomarkers of neurologic disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s [72], [73]. However, this methodology has been utilised most heavily in oncology, and various signatures have been described as diagnostic indicators of various types of cancer. For example, in several studies of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SELDI has been used to identify patients with HCC [74] and to distinguish between patients with HCC and hepatitis C virus [75], [76], [77]. The most recent study by Zinkin et al. [77], found that SELDI-ToF was more accurate than traditional biomarkers at detecting small tumours and although the authors recognised that the sample set was relatively small, this highlights the potential for this technique in clinical applications such as diagnosis of HCC.",

In addition, the results of this study were reproducible between two independent laboratories. In another study involving SCLC, biomarker profiles were identified that could distinguish between SCLC and healthy controls, SCLC from pneumonia and SCLC from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [79]. However, a note of caution must be introduced as the sample sets were relatively small, and the results require further validation with additional patient samples. In addition to lung cancer, SELDI has been reported in the identification of biomarker signatures able to distinguish between prostate cancer, benign prostate hyperplasia and healthy men [80]. SELDI has also been reported in the detection of colorectal cancer signatures [81], early stage ovarian cancer [82] and to distinguish patients with Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder [83], [84]. Furthermore, in several cancer types SELDI has been applied to the derivation of prognostic signatures, for example in the predication of relapse in breast cancer patients [85].",

However, caution must be employed when analysing these data, as these studies show minimal, if any overlap in the peaks/proteins that were identified as associated with breast cancer. This highlights a major challenge for the multi-centre use of SELDI in routine clinical use, as variables such as sample handling and processing, loading onto the target, washing, matrix type and the method of data acquisition and processing can all significantly affect the final data output. In addition, SELDI has thus far been unable to identify conventional tumour markers, such as \u03b1-fetoprotein [63].",

In the clinical proteomics setting, MRM has been successfully used to isolate and quantitate tryptic peptides in plasma which are indicative of disease, including C-reactive protein [26], apolipoprotein A-1 [25] and prostate-specific antigen [93]. Traditional diagnostics based upon 1 or several protein biomarkers involve the use of antibodies, typically requiring the development of an ELISA method. Antibody microarrays have been shown to have sensitivity ranging from 1 to 1000 pg/mL for cytokines in plasma [94], however, due to the idiosyncratic nature of antibody generation the development of reliable antibodies for screening can be problematic at best. Because MRM can detect peptides at low ng/mL levels [13], [95], [96] and is applicable to all peptides it is thought that this method may provide the most promise for biomarker validation and screening.",

In addition to problems presented by the analyte itself, many other factors such as specimen collection, handling and processing (fasting samples, freeze-thaw effects, life style variations, for example), pre-fractionation methodology, instrumentation set-up, database mining, statistical analysis and data storage will all lead to increased costs and decreased throughput and thus affect the ultimate success of LC\u2013MS/MS-based biomarker discovery [102].",

In contrast, basic research is dominated by studies of individual molecules. Therefore, in order for clinical proteomics by MS-based methods to be successful it is essential that the gap between these two disciplines is bridged [1]. One of the major challenges is the translation of pre-clinical animal studies into human subjects. MS offers the exciting prospect of bypassing this problem by moving directly into human bio-fluid samples for discovery-based medicine. In addition, there is potential to reduce the number of patients required for clinical testing by carrying out well designed pre-clinical studies in well characterised animal and/or cell line models [3].",

These include issues surrounding antibody reliability and sensitivity and the ability for multiplexing interactions which all impact upon their cost effectiveness. In the case of clinical proteomics it is likely that multiple novel candidates will be identified and thus multiple reaction monitoring/stable isotope dilution (MRM/SID\u2013MS) by triple quadrupole MS may be more feasible, allowing for greater throughput, accuracy, sensitivity and throughput than antibody development [13], [30]. Perhaps the most important factor for the realisation of personalised medicine provided by novel biomarkers identified by MS is the need for careful and rigorous validation of these markers though rationally designed, large scale clinical studies [1]. These can only be successfully realised by close working relationships between discovery labs and clinical centres. This highlights the major challenge faced by translational medicine, in particular clinical proteomics, but with careful planning it is hoped that the potential provided by continual developments in LC\u2013MS/MS methods for relative and absolute protein quantification will lead to advances in the way diseases such as cancer are diagnosed and managed.",

(a) Protein-level labelling either by culturing cells in the presence or absence of a \u2018heavy\u2019 isotope amino acid (e.g. stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) [33], not ameneable to clinical proteomics) or using chemical derivitisation, by methods such as ICAT (as shown) allows two conditions to be tested simultaneously. In the case of ICAT, the \u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 labels impart a mass difference of 9 Da without affecting the chromatographic properties of the labelled peptides, thus allowing relative quantification in MS. Subsequent MS/MS analysis must be conducted on targeted ion pairs to enable identification of differentially expressed proteins. (b) Peptide level labelling with isobaric tags such as iTRAQ (shown here) which allows multiplexing of up to eight samples in one run (two are shown for clarity). The different masses of each \u2018reporter\u2019 group are counteracted by a \u2018balance\u2019 group which confers isobaric properties on each tag in MS mode. Subsequently, multiplexed samples containing the same mix of peptides labelled with different iTRAQ tags will behave identically until they are fragmented during MS/MS. This provides several advantageous properties, as all equivalent peptides will behave identically in LC separation steps, and in MS and MS/MS mode the signal from all peptides may be summed (as they have the same mass), thus enhancing the sensitivity of detection. (c) Label-free methods such as SELDI (shown here) enrich for specific peptides by binding and eluting them from a \u2018chip\u2019 with a particular chromatographic surface prior to MS analysis. Proteins are not identified by this method, instead, peak patterns are derived in order to generate a proteomic profile which is used to compare multiple samples processed via the same method.",

In this example peptides from a tryptic digest enter the first quadrupole (Q1) and a diagnostic peptide (m/z 400) eluting at a specific time during liquid chromatography (LC) is isolated and enters the collision cell (Q2). Collision induced dissociated (CID) fragments this peptide and a specific product ion (m/z 390) if generated, is selected to enter the third quadrupole (Q3) where it then reaches the detector. This filtering dramatically reduces the background resulting in a significantly increased signal to noise and greater sensitivity. (b) Absolute quantification by MRM. Inclusion of an isotopically labelled standard peptide allows for MRM transitions to be monitored for the test and standard peptide. The mass difference imparted by the isotopomer enables the test and standard peptide to co-elute during LC and be monitored for different MRM transitions in parallel. As the concentration of the standard is known, the ratios of the total signal generated by each peptide can be calculated and thus used for absolute quantitation purposes.",
