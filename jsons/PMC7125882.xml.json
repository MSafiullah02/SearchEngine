Viral gastroenteritis can be more severe in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. RV causes 600,000\u2013875,000 deaths per year (Clark and McKendrick, 2004), the majority of which occur in developing countries, and it is the most severe and common cause of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age (Wilhelmi et al., 2003). Frequently, NoVs are responsible for outbreaks and sporadic cases of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in children and adults worldwide (Kele et al., 2011). SaV is considered an important cause of gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age, while it is of minor importance in adults (Eckardt and Baumgart, 2011). HAstVs and enteric HAdVs cause gastroenteritis, primarily in children less than 4 years of age (Dennehy, 2011).",

In detail, 5 \u03bcL of eluted nucleic acids were submitted to real-time RT-PCR, real-time PCR, nested RT-PCR, or nested PCR assays using the Ag-Path-ID one-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's indications.

Diagnostic panels (either molecular or immunologic) should include all virus agents potentially associated with gastrointestinal syndromes but are presently largely incomplete. Detection of gastrointestinal viruses is routinely performed using immunologic assays, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic test (ICT). Nevertheless, these tools have limited sensitivity (Rovida et al, 2013). In recent years, real-time PCR techniques have shown greater sensitivity and specificity than immunological assays for detection of gastrointestinal viruses (Clark and McKendrick, 2004, Rovida et al., 2013, Van Maarseveen et al., 2010, Wilhelmi et al., 2003).",

A limitation of the study is the unavailability of data on other gastrointestinal agents (parasites, bacteria, and fungi). Thus, the results of this study are useful to verify the relative frequency of different viruses in diarrheic stools, while attributing clinical significance to the virologic data would require a larger dataset. Gastrointestinal viruses were detected in about one third of symptomatic patients, a percentage somewhat lower than expected. The distribution of NoV, RV, SaV, HAstV, and HBoV infections is in agreement with data reported in previous surveillance studies in developed countries (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011, Medici et al., 2012, Van Maarseveen et al., 2010). However, unlike previous results, HAdV appeared to be the most frequent viral agent. This result could be related to the different sensitivity of assays used. However, monitoring HAdV gastrointestinal diseases in children aged <5 years over a period of 15 years in Japan showed that the annual percentage of HAdV infections ranged from 1.8% to 15.4% indicating yearly fluctuations in HAdV prevalence (Dey et al., 2012). HAdV infection in our study appeared to peak in October suggesting a potential cluster of infection. The investigation of potential local outbreaks is beyond the scope of this study. However, this type of investigation is highly needed and should be implemented.",

Our data support the presence of HRVs in a significant proportion of patients with gastroenteritis and also in the absence of other gastrointestinal viruses. However, more focused studies, including the systematic detection and culturing of viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents, are needed to understand the role of HRV in stool samples. In this study, several members of the genus Picornavirus were detected, including a case of HCoSV gastrointestinal infection, whose clinical characteristics have been reported elsewhere (Campanini et al., 2013).
