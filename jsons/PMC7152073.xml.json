Numerous studies in other body sites have clearly identified links between infections and autoimmunity and autoimmune disease [4, 5]. Only a limited number of studies have been reported in which retinal disorders have been evaluated to study this relationship. We will begin this chapter with a brief overview of infection and autoimmunity in the eye. This will be followed by specific examples of infections and autoimmunity in the retina. We will highlight two human diseases triggered by Onchocerca volvulus or Toxoplasma gondii and an experimental model referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR), triggered by the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).",

The eye is unique in that it lacks lymphatics and still enjoys an intimate relationship with the immune system. An inflammatory process in the eye is termed an uveitis, and it in no way reflects the origin of the inflammatory process nor where it is located in the eye. While there are many descriptions of inflammatory processes in the eye, there are three major presentations of these conditions. If the inflammatory condition is centered in the front of the eye, the process is termed an anterior uveitis. If upon examination the dominant part of the inflammation is centered in the vitreous of the eye, it is termed an intermediate uveitis. Finally, if inflammation occurs in the back of the eye, that is centered in the retina or the choroid of the eye, it is termed a posterior uveitis. Clearly inflammatory conditions may involve several parts of the eye, and if all anatomic of the eye are involved it is termed a panuveitis. Most of the comments of this chapter will address disorders of the back of the eye, i.e., those involving the retina.",

In addition to simple visualization, many additional tools can be readily applied. Electrophysiologic testing is easily and frequently performed, This is an excellent way to evaluate the retina's ability to react to a light stimulus. Fluorescein angiography, the use of dye injected into an arm vein and then rapid photographs are taken of the back of the eye. This approach helps to visualize the vascular system and the integrity of the retina. The severity of the inflammatory response can be graded by direct visualization of the inflammatory response in the eye. Most inflammatory process that we recognize will have a cellular response associated with it. We also know that antibody mediated pathology, as seen in such entities as cancer associated retinopathy, can occur, but appears to be the distinct minority of cases.",

It is known that antigen placed into the anterior chamber of the eye will induce a deviated immune response, with a marked decrease in cell mediated responses, but an intact cytotoxic and B-cell response is seen [1]. Addtionally, the retina is a complex structure with several layers needed to turn the light stimulus into a chemical signal ultimately sent to the brain. At the photoreceptor level and the single layer just below it, the retinal pigment epithelium, a number of uveitogenic antigens have been identified and characterized [2]. Two antigens in particular, the retinal S-antigen and the interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP), have been used to develop a model of autoimmune ocular disease which is termed experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) [3]. This model has many qualities of the disease seen in humans and has helped to better understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to disease. One major difference between this model and the human disease is of course that it is not spontaneous. It is not clear what triggers the human disease. This chapter will explore one such trigger, that of ocular infection. Several entities, some based on animal models, other seen in the clinic, will be discussed to elucidate the possible role between infection and autoimmunity.",

Either of these strains are responsible for approximately 50% of the common colds. A new human coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [12]. One of the closest relatives to the human SARS-Coronavirus is the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The JHM strain of MHV is the most thoroughly studied neurotropic coronavirus. It causes both acute and chronic central nervous system effects in mice and rats. Acute encephalomyelitis and chronic CNS disease have been observed in mice. In rats an autoimmune disease known as subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, has been described.",

Virus antigen was first detected within the RPE cell and the ciliary body epithelial cell at day 2 and this virus replication intensified at day 3 and 4. Between day 3 and 6 virus antigen was also detected in Muller-like cells that span the multiple layers of the neural retina. Occasionly, virus antigen was also observed within the ganglion cells. After day 7, infectious virus and viral antigen could not be detected within the retina. However, in situ hybridization studies identified that the viral RNA persisted within the retina until 60 days PI [14]. Anti-virus neutralizing antibodies were first noted at day 7 PI [13] and coincided with the disappearance of infectious virus and viral antigen.",

The retinal layers revealed disorganization with large areas of outer and inner segment loss. In addition, the RPE cells were morphologically abnormal with focal RPE cell swelling or proliferation, or with focal RPE cell atrophy or loss. Analysis of retinal cell function also revealed dramatic changes [15, 16].

Gene expression for these cytokines was not detected in retinas from untreated or mock-injected mice. EIA analysis of sera identified the presence of these same cytokine proteins in virus infected mice and not in untreated or mock injected mice. The presence of retinal mRNA for IFN-\u03b3 was also associated with the upregulation of MHC Class I and II molecules within the retina. MHC class I and II molecules were not identified within the normal or mock injected retinas. It was noted that the first cell to express these MHC molecules was the RPE cell. This cell is also the first cell to express new viral antigens during the infection in vivo and is persistently infected in vitro [17]. It is critically important to point out that this RPE cell has been shown to process and present retinal and non-retinal antigens to sensitized T cells and is upregulated to express MHC class II molecules during retinal autoimmune and degenerative processes [18, 19].",

When C57B1 and A/J mice were evaluated, we observed a disease pattern similar to that seen in BALB/c mice. However, retinal changes were less severe than those seen in BALB/c mice. Retinal tissue damage induced by JHM virus in CD-1 mice was very different (Table 1\n). Only the early phase of the disease, consisting of retinal vasculitis, was observed. These CD-1 mice did not develop the retinal degenerative disease. In fact, by day 20 PI, the retina had a normal appearance.

This observation suggested that the continued degenerative process may be associated with alterations directly induced by virus replication during the first few days after infection or it may be associated with additional factors. Inasmuch as viruses are know to trigger an autoimmune phenomena and some human retinopathies may be associated with autoantibody formation, we studied the possible production of antiretinal autoantibodies [11]. We found that the retinal degenerative process in BALB/c mice was associated with the presence of antiretinal autoantibodies (Table 2\n). These autoantibodies were not found in sera from normal or mock-injected mice. The presence of antibodies to retinal tissue was evaluated by immunoperoxidase staining on frozen sections of normal rat eyes. Two patterns of staining were observed, reactivity in the neural retinal and reactivity in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Fig. 1\n). The antiretinal autoantibodies first appeared as IgM class antibodies. This was later replaced by IgG class autoantibodies. The anti-RPE cell autoantiboedies were predominantly of the IgG class.",

In CD-1 mice, only the early stage, consisting of retinal vasculitis was seen. The CD-1 mice recovered and were not susceptible to the later phase of the disease, the retinal degenerative disease. We therefore, evaluated the development of a retinal degenerative disease and the development of antiretinal autoantibodies in these two strains of mice after inoculation with JHM virus [11]. The data summarized in Table 2 shows that all of the BABL/c mice developed antiretinal antibodies and developed pathologic changes consistent with retinal degenerative processes. In contrast, none of the CD-1 mice developed antiretinal autoantibodies. That is, in those mice that failed to develop antiretinal autoantibodies, they also failed to develop a retinal degeneration.

This longitudinal study measured serum antibody responses to the retinal S-antigen, a \u201cP\u201d antigen (thought to contain rhodopsin), and new antigen designated p59ag, all isolated from bovine retina. They reported that all the patients initially tested showed antibody responses to all three antigens. The anti-S-antigen responses tended to decrease with clinical improvement, while the anti-P antibodies remained high even after the acute attack was over. A more recent report by Whittle and colleagues [26] looked at a larger number of toxoplasmosis patients. In this study a total of 36 patients with toxoplasma retinochoroiditis were evaluated for evidence of anti-retinal antibodies. Thirty-four of these sera showed antibodies directed against the photoreceptor layer of the retina when tested with indirect immunofluorescence. Six of 16 controls showed a similar staining pattern with the p value as reported as < 0.001. Interestingly, using an EIA to measure the presence of anti-S-antigen antibodies, the researchers observed that 27 of 36 sera from toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis patients were positive, but so were 10 of 16 normals, with a calculated p value of greater than 0.05. The antibodies seen in the two assays did not appear to run in parallel. The author's interpretation of their data was that the extent of anti-retinal antibodies could not be explained by anti-S-antigen findings alone. They argued that these findings probably did not reflect an epiphenomenon since patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis were also evaluated. In that study the number of sera positive from patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis was considerably lower than that found in the toxoplasmosis group.",

In a later study, we evaluated the proliferative cell mediated responses in 40 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis. In addition to the retinal S-antigen, we also evaluated the response to crude toxoplasma antigen and to purified antigens from the parasite [28]. In addition, we performed an EIA to look for anti-S-antigen antibodies and HLA phenotyping to see if a specific HLA type was associated with S-antigen responsiveness. Of the 40 patient's lymphocytes tested, 16 (40%) had proliferative responses with a stimulation index above 2.5 (see Fig. 2\n). There appeared to be no correlation with this responsiveness and any HLA phenotype. Additionally, we were unable to demonstrate anti-S-antigen antibodies using EIA. The ocular toxoplasmosis patients could be divided by their lymphocytes responsiveness to the various toxoplasma antigens tested.

A number of studies indicate that this retinal disease process may involve autoimmune responses. In 1987, Chan and associates identified that a majority of onchocerciasis patients had anti-retinal antibodies in their sera and vitreous [31]. Using FA assays on human retina tissue, they observed reactivity in the inner retina and photoreceptor layers. During the 1990\u2032s, Braun, McKechnie and associates performed a number of studies to elucidate the nature of the autoimmune reactivity [32, 33, 34, 35]. They identified a recombinant antigen in O. volvulus that showed immunologic cross-reactivity with a component of the RPE [32, 33]. By western blot analysis, an antibody to a 22,000 mw antigen (OV39) of O. volvulus recognized a 44,000 mw component of the RPE cell. Subsequent studies have shown that hr 44 Ag is present in the optic nerve, epithelial layers of iris, ciliary body and RPE. Although OV39 and the hr 44 proteins are not homologus, they did show limited amino acid sequence identity [36]. Immunization of Lewis rats with either OV39 from O. volvulus or hr 44 from human retinal tissue, induced ocular pathology [35]. The retinal disease in the rat was characterized by extensive breakdown of the posterior blood-ocular barrier, iridocyclitis and retinitis and the activation of retinal microglia. These studies indicate that, molecular mimicry between O. volvulus and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinopathy found in patients with onchoceriacis.",

These data also indicate that distinct pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by these three organisms. In T. gondii infections, the persistence and chronic reactivation of the organism is probably responsible for introduction and presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes to the immune system. In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinal pathology. In ECOR, similar processes are induced in coronavirus-infected mice displaying either retinal degeneration susceptibility or retina degeneration resistance. However, recent evidence indicates that differences in time of induction, in duration and intensity of immune reactivity may contribute to autoimmune reactivity in BALB/c mice.",
