The pharmacokinetics of tizoxanide have also been assessed over 7 days following administration orally at 500 mg and 1000 mg BD with food [6]. Pharmacokinetics were not influenced by repeat dosing at 500 mg BD (Cmax 10,400 ng/mL after single dose compared with 12,200 ng/mL on day 7) but increased considerably after repeat dosing at 1000 mg BD (Cmax 16,800 ng/mL after single dose vs 26,400 ng/mL on day 7) [6].

Nitazoxanide concentration has also been specifically predicted to exceed its EC50 for SARS-CoV-2 by 3.1-fold in the lung [8]. It should be noted that this EC50 value was reported for nitazoxanide rather than its human metabolite, tizoxanide, but previous studies have shown similar activity to nitazoxanide when tested against various strains of influenza [9].",

In early animal studies, nitazoxanide did not adversely affect fertility, even at high doses in rats. There was also no evidence of harm to the fetus in rats or rabbits, despite high-dose regimens. However, there are no adequate studies assessing the effects of nitazoxanide in pregnant women, and it is not known whether nitazoxanide is excreted in human breast milk [20]. Therefore, the FDA catagorises the potential of teratogenic effects as \u2018Category B\u2019 [19], denoting no particular cause for concern but an inadequate evidence base to draw a complete conclusion on safety. Caution continues to be advised in both pregnant women and nursing mothers.",
