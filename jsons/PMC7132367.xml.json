In early 2009, the novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1pdm09) was first identified in Mexico and the United States, and it spread within a few weeks through international travel into a pandemic (Bautista et al., 2010). A prospective observational study in Hong Kong of adults hospitalized for H1N1pdm09 infection showed significant complications and mortality, even though the patients were younger than those with seasonal influenza. Antiviral treatment with oseltamivir administered within 96 h of illness onset improved survival, but without timely treatment, the mortality risk was higher for H1N1pdm09 than for seasonal influenza [9.0% vs. 5.8%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio (OR), 6.85; 95% CI, 1.64\u201328.65; P\n = 0.008] (Lee et al., 2011a).",

Severe cytokine storm, with marked elevations of interleukin (IL)-6, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL9/MIG, has been detected in patients with severe influenza A(H5N1) infection, in association with high viral load (Peiris et al., 2004, de Jong et al., 2006). Cytokine dysregulation has also been observed in patients with H1N1pdm09 influenza, with higher plasma levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR1) detected in those with severe infection, compared to mild disease; high cytokine levels correlated with the progression of pneumonia (Lee et al., 2011b, To et al., 2010). Antiviral therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) can improve the clinical outcome if administered to patients hospitalized with seasonal (Lee et al., 2010) or H1N1pdm09 influenza (Lee et al., 2011a) within 4\u20135 days of illness onset, and may reduce mortality when started within 6\u20138 days of symptom onset in all age groups with influenza A(H5N1) (Adisasmito et al., 2010). However, the final outcome is often compromised by delay in patient presentation and initiation of therapy.",

Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma was administered as an adjunctive treatment with a favorable outcome in a patient in China with severe A(H5N1) influenza pneumonia and multi-organ failure, who did not respond initially to high-dose of NAI oseltamivir (Zhou et al., 2007). Animal data have shown that administration of anti-H5N1 specific antibodies, in the form of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera (convalescent or post-immunization), is effective in treating influenza A(H5N1) disease (Lu et al., 2006, Hanson et al., 2006).",

More recently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with severe H1N1pdm09 infection in five hospitals in Hong Kong assessed the value of treatment with hyperimmune intravenous gammaglobulin (H-IVIG) prepared from plasma of persons who had recovered from the disease in comparison to treatment with normal IVIG manufactured before 2009 (Hung et al., 2013). Patients who were on standard antiviral therapy and required intensive care support were randomized to receive H-IVIG (n\n = 17) or IVIG (n\n = 18). The H-IVIG group had significantly lower day 5 and 7 viral load, and a multivariate analysis of the 22 patients who received either H-IVIG or IVIG within 5 days of symptom onset found that H-IVIG treatment was the only factor which independently reduced mortality (OR:0.14, 95% CI, 0.02\u20130.92; p\n = 0.04).",

In a study that analyzed prepandemic IVIG and sera from Kawasaki disease patients (who had received IVIG as the standard treatment for autoimmune vasculitis) for H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies by micro-neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition, investigators found that all six IVIG preparations tested had significant levels of cross-reactive specific antibody, at a concentration of 2.0 g/dL of immunoglobulin (Hong et al., 2011). Sera from 18 to 19 Kawasaki disease patients had significant increases in cross-reactive-specific antibody after receiving 2.0 g/kg of prepandemic IVIG. These data suggest a potential role for adjunctive IVIG therapy for severe influenza, especially in immunocompromised patients. A case report on a 59-year-old male patient with ARDS due to H1N1pdm09 influenza, who did not respond initially to twice-daily oseltamivir at a dose of 150 mg, described a favorable outcome following the administration of IVIG (Chong et al., 2011).

The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been proposed as a mechanism of pulmonary damage caused by influenza virus infection (Han and Meydani, 2000). Leukocytes may be activated and primed by virus infection, producing ROS, and increased xanthine oxidase levels were found in influenza A virus-infected lungs (Akaike et al., 1990). Lung epithelial cells may also be a source of ROS, since influenza A virus infection induced an oxidant stress response in cultured airway epithelial cells (Knobil et al., 1998). NAC was shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory molecules (CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, and IL6) in lung epithelial cells infected with the highly pathogenic influenza A (H5N1) virus (Geiler et al., 2010). High-dose NAC, administered at 100 mg/kg daily as a continuous IV infusion, appeared to be effective in reducing C-reactive protein and oxygen requirement and improving the clinical outcome in a 48-year-old, previously healthy woman, who had presented with severe pneumonia and septic shock due to H1N1pdm09 influenza. However, interpretation of the efficacy of NAC was limited by the concomitant use of NAI oseltamivir at 150 mg twice-daily (Lai et al., 2010).",

Dexamethasone treatment reduced mononuclear cells in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of smoke-exposed, virus-infected mice, while pioglitazone reduced mononuclear cells and neutrophils in the BAL and increased peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Bauer et al., 2010).",

These tipDCs appear to be required for the further proliferation of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells in the infected lung, because blocking their recruitment in CCR2-knockout mice decreased the numbers of CD8+ effectors and reduced virus clearance. However, the investigators found that treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone reduced tipDC trafficking, and concluded that this might moderate the potentially lethal consequences of excessive tipDC recruitment, without abrogating CD8+ T cell expansion or compromising virus control (Aldridge et al., 2009).",

Drug treatment was deliberately initiated at 48 h after viral challenge, to imitate a real-life scenario. Survival rates and survival time were improved in the group that received combinations of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine, compared to zanamivir alone. Significantly higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and less pulmonary inflammation were also noted in the group receiving the triple therapy. Zanamivir alone reduced viral load, but without any significant effect on lung inflammation or mortality. Celecoxib is well known as a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. Mesalazine can inhibit both lipoxygenase and COX pathways, leading to reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids, and therefore deactivation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Mesalazine also inhibits NF-\u03baB activation and promotes phosphatidic acid synthesis, inhibiting the stimulatory effects of ceramides on apoptosis (Zheng et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Data from several observational studies have shown that systemic corticosteroid therapy was associated with a higher risk of death, an increased rate of nosocomial pneumonia and an increased risk of developing critical disease in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 influenza, especially those with initiation of oseltamivir after day 3\u20134 of illness, or who did not receive NAI therapy:1.A prospective observational study of 147 adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza A(H3N2) in Hong Kong showed that systemic corticosteroids, which had been administered for acute exacerbations of either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, was an independent risk factor (adjusted OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.86\u201315.89) associated with delayed viral clearance beyond the first week of illness (Lee et al., 2009).2.In the European Society of Intensive Care H1N1pdm09 influenza cohort (n\n = 220), there was a delay of NAI therapy (mainly oseltamivir) of an average of 4\u20135 days from influenza-like illness onset, and 67 patients (30.5%) died. Those who received early systemic corticosteroids (n\n = 126) were older and more likely to have coexisting asthma, COPD, or chronic steroid use. After adjusting for severity and potential confounding factors, Cox regression analysis showed that early use of systemic corticosteroids was not significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% CI 0.7\u20132.4, p\n = 0.4], but systeic steroid therapy was associated with an increased rate of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0\u20134.8, p\n < 0.05) (Martin-Loeches et al., 2011).3.Of the 208 patients with ARDS in the French H1N1pdm09 ICU Registry, 83 (40%) received systemic corticosteroids for ARDS, in a median initial dose of 270 mg of hydrocortisone daily, for a median of 11 days. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was associated with a fatal outcome, both in crude analysis (33.7 vs. 16.8%; HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3\u20134.3; P\n = 0.004) and after propensity score-adjusted analysis (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1\u22125.4; P\n = 0.002), more hospital-acquired pneumonia and a trend towards a greater duration of ventilation (Brun-Buisson et al., 2011).4.In the Korean cohort of critically ill patients with H1N1pdm09 infection (N\n = 245), NAI (mainly oseltamivir) was given at mean 4.5 \u00b1 4.0 days from illness onset, whereas 107 (44%) received adjuvant systemic corticosteroids treatment for ARDS. Systemic steroid treatment was associated with an increased 90 day mortality, when independent predictors and propensity score were considered (adjusted OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.03\u20134.71). The patients were also more likely to develop secondary bacterial pneumonia or invasive fungal infections, and had more prolonged ICU stays than the no-steroid group (Kim et al., 2011).5.Among 83 hospitalized patients with H1N1pdm09 infection in four Chinese hospitals, there was a median delay of 5 days from the onset of influenza-like illness to hospital admission; 46% developed critical illness, of whom 17% died and 37% recovered. Of 17 patients who received glucocorticoid therapy beginning less than 72 h after illness onset, 71% subsequently developed critical disease, as compared to 39% of 66 patients who received late or no glucocorticoids (risk ratio by Mantel\u2013Haenszel testing = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2\u20132.8, after adjusting for underlying diseases and risk factors). Proportional hazards modeling showed that use of glucocorticoids tripled the hazard of developing critical illness (Han et al., 2011).6.In contrast, a retrospective review of Japanese patients in a national hospital, who had received NAI mostly within 2 days of illness onset, showed that the administration of systemic corticosteroids for H1N1pdm09-related pneumonia with acute wheezing was not associated with an adverse outcome (Kudo et al., 2012).\n",

Until recently, interpretation of the efficacy of convalescent plasma was limited by data based on case reports and studies of non-randomized design. However, a newly published RCT has shown that patients with severe H1N1pdm09 influenza who received hyperimmune-IVIG had a lower viral load and a lower risk of death, if treatment was begun within 5 days of symptom onset. Evaluation of antibody titers may provide useful information about IVIG, which may be used for immunomodulation when a new influenza virus emerges in the human population. More animal experiments and detailed human observational studies and (where feasible) RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulatory effects, such as the acute use of statins, NAC, macrolides, PPAR agonists, celecoxib and mesalazine. In particular, the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy requires more investigation (Table 1\n). Systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity, including the hospital length of stay and secondary bacterial or fungal infections in patients with severe influenza, especially when there is a delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy.",
