In addition, from a technical viewpoint, the microarray assay requires fewer human interventions (up to 5 hr of hands\u2010on time can be saved compared to qRT\u2010PCR) and allows for the testing of up to 24 samples per run (66 min of setup, excluding RNA extraction and RT\u2010PCR) with the results available on the next day [Frobert et al., 2011; Raymond et al., 2009]. Thus, the surveillance system could be sustained during periods when the number of cases of influenza\u2010like illness is much higher. Although obtaining the results on the same day would be the ideal scenario, the ease of implementation and higher throughput are important factors, especially in high\u2010volume laboratories [Raymond et al., 2009]. The present pilot study was not optimized to shorten the delay between collection and delivering the results to the GPs, the reason why the actual delay was 10\u201314 days. However, the results of the surveillance were made available the week following sample collection, notably because results were aggregated over the preceding week.",

The small number of participants in this first season might easily be explained by the case definition for the collection of specimens, which were rather stringent and included elevated fever. Of note, 146 (97%) GPs have agreed to continue participating in the programme during the winter of 2010\u20132011.",

On the other hand, false\u2010negative results may have occurred in the adult population and could have been the consequence of insufficient quality of the sample collected or of a lack of sensitivity of the laboratory techniques.
