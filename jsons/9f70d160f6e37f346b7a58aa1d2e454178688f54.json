The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic on March 11 2020. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries, and developed countries like Italy, China, Australia, the USA are the most affected by this virus. The origin of the virus is yet to be confirmed, but the first person tested positive is from Wuhan, China. It is spreading very quickly throughout the world, and the number of confirmed cases is about to reach 4 million, and the recovery rate is around 34% in the world. (Worldometer, May 7 2020). In India, the first positive case of COVID-19 was detected on January 30 2020, in Kerala. On May 7, the country has 35,902 active cases, with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria stating that according to data released by experts and going by the current trend, the cases are likely to peak in June-July. Of the total 35,902 active cases, 4.8 percent of patients are in ICU, 1.1 per cent on ventilators, and 3.3 per cent are on oxygen support. Currently, on May 8, India had 821 dedicated COVID hospitals with 1,50,059 beds (1,32,219 isolation beds and 17,840 ICU beds) and 1,898 dedicated COVID Health Centres with 1,19,109 beds (1,09,286 isolation beds and 9,823 ICU beds) along with 7,569 quarantine centres (PIB-Updates on COVID 19, May 8) . However, if infections continue to rise at the same rate in May as they have done so far in April, India could be facing a deficit in isolation beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators in the coming time.",

            "text": "According to the report of World Population prospects (2019), India has a population of more than 1.36 billion and most of the population of urban areas and cities are under the risk of contracting the virus. So, it is important to forecast numbers of confirmed and active cases at the national and state level for India to see which states will be having the highest burden of the increasing confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 by the end of the June. Another objective of this study is to forecast the requirements of healthcare infrastructure in the coming months based on the numbers of active cases projected. This will be helpful to do proper future planning for the health facility in India. This will be helpful for the government to provide health facilities like isolation beds, ventilators and ICU units in time to time without any overburden on the health system. Tiwari et al. (2020) made their prediction for India based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. They predicted that the peak of the cases for India would be attained between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68,978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. However, this prediction does not seem to fit in the current situation as we are observing around 4000 daily confirmed cases and (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria also stated that according to data released by experts and going by the current trend, the cases are likely to peak in June-July. Another study by Singh et al. (2020) to identify the top 15 countries with the spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. A comparison was made between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the COVID-19 disease spread trajectories for the next two months. Their predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries would double in all the observed countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. Chakraborty (2020) also used a hybrid approach based on Autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. Guan et al. (2020) in his study on data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020, found that 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Another study by Wu et al. (2020) from China suggests that 15-20% of COVID-19 cases require hospitalization, with around 15% of cases presenting with severe symptoms and 5% requiring intensive care. A study by Lazzerini et al. (2020) for Italy and Spain suggested that 40-55% of COVID-19 positive cases have been hospitalized, with 7-12% requiring admission to intensive care units. Based on the COVID-19 Cases in Italy shows that 10-25% of patients will require ventilation, and some patients will need ventilation for several weeks. Remuzzi et al., (2020) find that the percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.",

ARIMA model is one of the generalized forms of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model among the time series forecasting. We fit both models to understand the data better or to predict future points in the series (Forecasting) . ARIMA model depends or always represented with the help of some parameters, and the model has expressed as ARIMA (p, d, q): p, d and q are non-negative integers. The parameters have their usual meaning, here, p stands for the order of auto-regression, d represents the degree of trend difference (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted) for the stationary of the trend and q signifies the order of moving average. This model combines auto regression lags under the stationary trend and moving average and predict better future values based on past and recent data. For this model, the degree of parameters p, d and q determine based on the partial Auto-correlation function (PACF) graph, The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to test the stationary of the time series observations and Complete Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) graph respectively ",

A country needs to know how much burden of active and confirmed cases it will have to bear in the coming time. It will help the country in taking pro-active measures to prepare adequate health infrastructure for the coming time based on future needs. We used ARIMA model and Auto ARIMA model on the time series data of COVID-19 cases in India for forecasting the total confirmed and active cases till June end. Based on our forecasted values of active cases, we calculated the healthcare infrastructure required in the coming time. Based on our forecasts, confirmed cases for India at the end of May are expected to be 178387 (95% CI: 128806, 227968). India will be having 294858 confirmed cases (95% CI: 173917, 415800) in the mid of June from our estimates. We expect that India will be having 441896 confirmed cases (95% CI: 210240, 673552) at the end of June. Our current estimates for confirmed cases are in line with the actual number of confirmed cases as on May 14, India has 82,047 confirmed cases, while our estimates suggested 83,336 confirmed cases (95% CI: 74752, 91921). AIIMS also suggested that peak will be achieved in months of June-July. Our results also show that daily confirmed cases are increasing at a faster pace even at the end of June with around 10,000 daily confirmed cases, so it is likely that peak will be attained afterwards. By the end of the June, Maharashtra (58330 confirmed cases (95% CI: 28654,88005)), Punjab (42041 confirmed cases (95% CI: 667, 83416)), Delhi (24372 confirmed cases (CI: 5674, 43070) & Gujarat (27120 confirmed cases (95% CI: 6748, 47492)) will be the most affected states.

When it comes to states, Maharashtra will require 40128 isolation beds (95% CI:18790, 61465), Punjab will require 31186 isolation beds (95% CI: 597,61776), Delhi will require 16418 isolation beds (95% CI: 0, 37053), and Gujarat will require 12867 isolation beds (95% CI:3001, 22732). For critically ill patients, there is a requirement of ICU beds and ventilators. Based on our forecasts for the end of June month, the required number of ICU beds for India will be 12471 (95% CI: 6848,18094) and 6236 ventilators (95% CI: 3424,9047). Maharashtra will require 4721 ICU beds (95% CI: 2211,7231) and 2360 ventilators (95% CI: 1105,3616), Punjab will require 3669 ICU beds (95% CI: 70, 7268) and 1834 ventilators (95% CI:35,3634), Delhi will require 1932 ICU beds (95% CI:0,4359) and 966 ventilators (95% CI:0,2180) and Gujarat will require 1514 ICU beds (95% CI:353,2674) and 757 ventilators (95% CI:177,1337). At present, India seems to be well prepared for the challenge as on May 8, India had 821 dedicated COVID hospitals with 1,50,059 beds (1,32,219 isolation beds and 17,840 ICU beds).",

However, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases, active cases and healthcare infrastructure as we made this forecast based on the data till May 3, when India observed complete lockdown. Currently, India has a partial lockdown with restrictions varying for three zones (red, orange and green zone) based on the current assessment of the situation in there. In future, lockdown might be lifted, and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. The migrants are returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period, which may lead to a rise in the number of cases, and could not be accounted for, in our projections. So, India and its majorly affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi need to be well prepared for the pandemic challenge in coming time and focus on increasing their healthcare infrastructure, and other states should also remain alert till the pandemic completely recedes. We suggest a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system.",

So, the forecasted cases in future will be showing the same trend as India would have observed, had it been observing complete lockdown. Since May 4, India is observing partial lockdown, and which might be removed in the coming time so that actual cases will be more than the forecasted cases. For some states like Punjab showing more COVID-19 infection and Madhya Pradesh showing decline trend in future, but the situation may not occur in future because of the nature of the previous trend-pattern is different from now. Forecasted cases based on ARIMA model in our study for some states having lower bound for the 95% CI comes negative values which we have considered zero cases in that situation. In our study, the seasonality factor did not consider which is important in India, and maybe it affects our forecasting in future because of monsoon diseases.",
