This direct binding of cardenolides to Na+/K+-ATPase (located in the cell membrane) induces endocytosis, which reduces the amount of Na+/K+-ATPase at the cellular surface, perturbing the homeostasis of cell solutes, and hence elevating intracellular calcium levels (Diederich et al., 2017; Newman et al., 2008; Prassas and Diamandis, 2008). Exploration of novel anti-viral associated signaling axes of the cardenolides is expected to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of their toxicity.",

The binding of cardenolides to Na+/K+-ATPase not only inhibits the activity of the solute pump, but also results in the recruitment of Na+/K+-ATPase associated signalsomes in cancer cells, initiating the associated signaling pathways, and hence the anti-cardiovascular dysfunction and anti-cancer biological activities (Diederich et al., 2017; Newman et al., 2008; Prassas and Diamandis, 2008). These signalings are involved in Src-mediated cytostatic effects, cell death pathways (including non-apoptotic cell death, apoptosis, autophagy, or mitophagy), and nuclear events (including transcriptional activity, epigenetic effects) etc. (Diederich et al., 2017). However, only a few reports have investigated the antiviral mechanisms of cardenolides (Burkard et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017a).",

TGEV spike (S) protein binds to porcine cell receptor aminopeptidase N, to aide in the entry of TGEV into cells. Swine testicular (ST) cells have been used as a host cell line for TGEV in many studies since the 1990s because ST cells express aminopeptidase N and are highly susceptible to TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992; Oh et al., 2003; Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1995; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). Previously, we reported that a variety of cardenolides (including ouabain) exert potent anti-TGEV activities (Yang et al., 2017a). While knocking down the expression of Na+/K+-ATPase decreases TGEV infectivity in ST cells (Yang et al., 2017a), the exact associated effective pathways remain to be investigated.",

The Taiwan field isolated virulent strain of TGEV was propagated in ST cells cultured with MEM and 2% FBS. IFA and studies on the mechanistic signaling effectors regarding ouabain and the other pharmacological inhibitors in TGEV infected ST cells were performed as described (Yang et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2017b). Briefly, the ST cells in 96-well plates, with or without pretreatment of test compounds, were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 7. After 6 h of TGEV infection, ST cells were fixed and subjected to an indirect IFA with antibodies against the S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of TGEV. The cells were treated with eight different concentrations of test compounds. The resultant cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and the fluorescence intensities were measured to determine the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for inhibiting S and N protein expression. The results of these assays were used to obtain the dose-response curves from which IC50s were determined.",

We selected ouabain (Fig. 1A) to study the mechanism by which this inhibition occurs. After infection in ST cells, TGEV exhibited a log phase increase in viral yields and reached a plateau from 15 to 22 h.p.i. with titers of ~109 p.f.u. /ml (Yang et al., 2017b). As expected, in TGEV infected ST cells with an MOI of 0.01 at 22 h.p.i., ouabain diminished both the viral titers and viral yields, even at low doses, in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 37 \u00b1 15 nM. Ultimately, ouabain treatments at concentrations of 1000\u20133000 nM resulted in reductions of viral titer by ~7\u20138 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1B). Similarly, ouabain treatments resulted in the reduction of the number of viral RNA copies by ~3 orders of magnitude in TGEV infected ST cells, with an MOI of 7 at 6 h.p.i. (Fig. 1C). Moreover, TGEV infection (0.01 MOI) induced a sustained production of IL-6 over a 30 h period in ST cells (Fig. 2A); and this induction was profoundly diminished by ouabain in a dose dependent manner with an IC50 of 23 \u00b1 2 nM (Fig. 2B).",

Therefore, we further examined the downstream effectors of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and PDK1, and found that only the PDK1 inhibitor BX795 was able to reverse the anti-TGEV activity of ouabain (Fig. 4). When Na+/K+-ATPase, not PI3K or PDK1, was knocked down in ST cells, a significant amount of N protein expression was suppressed, reflecting a decrease in virus infectivity. However, when PI3K or PDK1 was knocked down in ST cells, these cells became more resistant to ouabain treatment than control shRNA harboring ST cells, reflecting a reverse in virus infectivity (Fig. 5). Finally, combination treatments of either LY294002 or BX795 with ouabain successfully reversed the activity of the ouabain, and increased TGEV titers (Fig. 6).",
