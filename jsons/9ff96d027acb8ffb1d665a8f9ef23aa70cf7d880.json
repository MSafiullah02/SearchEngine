Paper ini menjelaskan pemodelan matematik pada analisa wabah COVID-19 di Indonesia pada tahun 2020 pada 3 Maret 2020 hingga 19 April 2020 dengan modifikasi persamaan Bernoulli dan simulasi dengan MATLAB. Pada penelitian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa jumlah pertambahan orang positif COVID-19 per hari di Indonesia akan mencampai puncak di sekitar titik maksimum 400 dan jumlah total orang yang terinfeksi COVID-19 di Indoensia akan mencapai 12000 orang dengan masa akhir pandemic sekitar pertengahan juni. Pada pemodelan ini juga telah divalidasi dengan data real dan ditemukan bahwa nilai R 2 = 0.9927 untuk jumlah total orang yang positif COVID-19 di Indonesia pada 3 Maret 2020 hingga 19 April 2020, sementara pertambahan harian kasus baru memiliki nilai R 2 = 0.807. berdasarkan hasil penelitian ini didapatkan bahwa hasil pemodelan memeprlihatkan hasil yang cukup baik untuk analisa kasus COVID-19 di Indoensia",

            "text": "The application of differential equations is commonly used in mathematics and physics, as well as various other sciences to explain a phenomenon in a system. Commonly, an ordinary differential equation is used in mathematics, physics, engineering and various other sciences to explain a phenomenon in a system [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In mathematics and in physics, the topic theory of the ordinary differential equations can be found in various fields of physics. Ordinary differential equation is one of the equations that exists as an independent variable, for example, time (t) and there are one or more derivatives as an independent function variable, for example, a derivatives ( ) = ( ) . In a model with the ordinary differential equation, the value of variable ( ) is very important to obtain and to determine accurately. The results of the value of ( ) can generally be used to explain the phenomenon in some cases [1] . Ordinary differential equations can be found in many fields of physics, such as geometry, mechanics, astronomy, particle physics, medical physics, textile physics, material physics and so on said some researchers such as Brooks-Pollock, E. and K.T.D. Eames [2] , Blanchard, P. Robert, LD, and Glen, RH [1] , Grassly NC\uff0cFraser C. [3] , Stone, L., Shulgin, B., Agur, Z [4], Rihan, FA & Anwar, NM [5] , Nuraini, Khairudin, & Apri [6] , Hyman & Li [7] . The application of the model using the system of differential equations in the textile field is carried out by several researchers such as Putra, Maruto & Rosyid, [8] and Putra, Rosyid & Maruto [9] . One of the applications of the ordinary differential equations in the medical field is modeling to analyze the spread of epidemic infections. Some forms of the ordinary differential equations in analyzing the spread of the plague can be shown in Equation (1), Equation (2) and Equation (3) (7) ( )",

Through modeling using MATLAB / Simulink, it was found that the daily number of nCOVID-19 cases in Indonesia will have the highest case at a maximum of around 400 and the total number of positive nCOVID-19 in Indonesia will reach 12000 people with a quiet period in mid-June. In this modeling it has also been found that the large value of R 2 = 0.9927 on the total number of positive COVID-19 in Indonesia taken from 3 March 2020 to 19 April 2020, while the value of R 2 = 0.807 daily number of positive new cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia taken from March 3, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Based on the study, the situation applied in Indonesia with strict social distancing and the awareness of the community seriously about the importance of social distancing and there is no movement of people from abroad into the country on a large scale will alleviate the plague of nCOVID -19 this in mid-June. In this study, it has also been found that MATLAB / Simulink in Figure 2 can be used to solve the case of a differential equation with the Bernoulli equation in the nCOVID-19 plague modeling example with sufficient accuracy. Based on the simulation results, it is found that for the greater r-value while the other parameters are constant, the shape of the speed curve per day will be more acute with a relatively shorter time but a higher peak speed per day. Based on the simulation results also found that for the greater value \u03b8, then the peak point of the rate curve per day is also greater with the same duration of time. Based on the simulation results also found that for the value of \u03a9 = m the greater, then the peak point of the rate curve per day will be smaller but has a longer time duration. At the very beginning of the COVID-19 plague, it was believed to be a disease transmitted by respiratory droplets through close person-to-person contact. Respiratory droplets are relatively large-sized particles and thus cannot travel long distances through air and therefore this transmission cannot account for the rapid and widespread disease. The increase of the virus spread can be stopped by the social distancing method. In handling the nCOVID-19 pandemic problem in Indonesia, it can be shown that the Indonesian government has done a pandemic reduction that can be demonstrated with the model 1 curve. Curve model 1 shows that the nCOVID-19 pandemic will last approximately three months but at a daily rate of nCOVID-19 patients which is quite low. Model-6 and model 7 can minimize the rate per day of nCOVID-19 patients but have an exposed period of around five months of a pandemic. Based on this model it can be shown that the government must be able to make a choice regarding the length of the pandemic which must be as minimal as possible but with a minimal number of rates per day for COVID-19 patients. With the methods currently carried out by the government, such as social distancing, calls for health care and public awareness, it can be predicted that the length of the pandemic will last for three months.",
