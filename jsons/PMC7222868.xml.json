Only from approximately 32 weeks age or 1500 g body weight, infants are able to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing and the danger of aspiration, allowing drinking milk without danger [2]. Generally, tube feeding consists of continuous feeding and intermittent bolus feeding. Continuous feeding is defined as delivering enteral nutrition with constant speed for 24 h via nutritional pump [2, 3]. Intermittent bolus feeding is defined as delivering enteral nutrition multiple times [4], generally giving 15\u201330 min every 2\u20133 h by gravity or electric pump.",

            "text": "Previous studies have found that both continuous feeding and intermittent bolus feeding have benefits and risks for preterm infants. On the one hand, continuous feeding can maintain the gastrointestinal hormonal such as gastrin and insulin at a high level [5], leading to the increase of absorption and reduction of energy expenditure [6]. On the other hand, continuous infusion of milk into the infant\u2019s gastrointestinal tract may lead to disorders of gastrointestinal hormones and long-term growth inhibition. A study on animal models suggested that continuous feeding, comparing with intermittent bolus feeding, reduces glucagon like peptide-1, which may contribute to organ dysfunction [7]. In addition, the incidence of prolonged apnea and apnea related hypoxia diseases such as retinopathy [8] in continuous feeding is significantly higher than that in intermittent feeding [5]. Regarding to intermittent bolus feeding, it was thought to more physiologic [9], making infants have cyclical surges of gastrin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and insulin, therefore, promoting the gastrointestinal tract development [9]. Moreover, intermittent feeding allows more parental involvement in feeding [10] and splanchnic perfusion [11]. Moreover, intermittent feeding promotes protein synthesis and improves the whole body\u2019s protein balance [12, 13], which play an important role in regulating nutritional disorders in infants. However, for premature infants, intermittent milk feeding may lead to feeding intolerance because it is easy for infants to exceed the absorbed capacity of their gastrointestinal tract with bolus milk infusion. Intermittent feeding also has been reported to be associated with metabolic instability [14] and impaired pulmonary functions [15] in preterm infants.",

However, these studies did not reach an agreement. In 2011, Premji and Chessell [19] conducted a meta-analysis of seven randomized and quasi-randomized studies and found that it was inadequate for determining a preferred feeding method because of some limitations, such as small sample size and the inclusion of quasi-randomized studies. Therefore, now it is time for an update as larger, well designed studies reported on the effect of continuous feeding and intermittent feeding in preterm infants have appeared after 2011 [10, 11, 20, 21]. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the clinical risks and benefits of each method and help clinicians choose appropriate feeding strategy.",

However, our results were different from Dsilna\u2019s [18] findings, which displayed that continuous feeding infants achieve full feeds faster than intermittent feeding infants (aHR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.03\u20133.27), especially in infants with birth weight \u2264850 g (aHR = 4.13, 95% CI 1.48\u201311.53). A retrospective study conducted by Rojahn [36] also showed that continuous group had fewer days to attain full feeds. One reason for this difference may be that the characteristics of subject such as birth weight and gestational age were different. Dsilna [18] focused on infants with birth weight <1200 g and gestational age between 24 and 29 weeks. Other studies mainly focused on larger birth weight infants [10, 33]. Moreover, the feeding protocol including milk composition, starting time of enteral nutrition, and the daily increase of milk volume was different. We did not find significant difference of time to achieve full feeds in subgroup analysis for birth weight. The reason may be that only four studies included in subgroup analysis and the sample size was too small. The finding in our study suggested that intermittent bolus feeding was more preferable for infants in terms of decreasing time to attain full enteral feeds. However, further research is needed on which feeding methods are more beneficial for infants of different gestational age and birth weight.",

In subgroup analysis, we also did not detect significant difference in time to attain full feeds, time to regain birth weight, and duration of hospitalization. The reason may be that the sample size was insufficient. In addition, the interference from other treatments for premature infants such as invasive or noninvasive ventilator support and prolonged parenteral nutrition may contribute to these results. Another reason for these results is that many preterm infants had severe disease, which may affect their nutritional status.",

The inconsistence of the feeding protocols of included studies is an example of this issue. In this study, four studies did not state the strategy of continuous feeding strategy or intermittent feeding [17, 20, 33, 34]. Most studies started enteral feeding on the second to fourth day after birth [17, 33\u201335]. Only two studies started enteral nutrition within 30 h postnatal age [10, 18]. A recent review [37] proposed a reasonable strategy to optimize enteral feeding practice, in which the first feeding time should be started between 6 and 48 h of life, to avoid gastrointestinal atrophy and dysfunction. The studies included in this meta-analysis were mostly breast-fed (from their own mother) or formula-fed. Only one study used human milk feeding only, adding frozen pasteurized human milk from the local milk bank when the milk production of the mother was inadequate [18]. A detailed review [37] presented the large number of benefits of human milk for premature infants, and advocated donor human milk can be used alternatively when human milk was inadequate. In addition, the lack of uniformity of definition of the outcome index is another issue. For example, the full enteral feeds had different definitions in different studies. Schanler [33] and Macdonald [34] defined full feeds as achieving 150 ml/kg/day, and Dsilna [18] defined full feeds as attaining 140\u2013160 ml/kg/day. Dollberg [17] and Roverkamp-Abels [10] defined full feeds as achieving 160 ml/kg/day and 120 ml/kg/day, respectively. Akintorin [15] defined full feeds as the ability to tolerate enteral feedings of 100 kcal/kg/day for at least 48 h. Furthermore, the measure time points were different in each study. In some studies [15, 33], researchers measured gastric residual every 2 or 3 h to maintain consistency with feeding intervals, and another part of studies [10, 18] measured gastric residual every 6\u20138 h, which in line with the physiological characteristics of gastrointestinal activity in infants. Birth weight, height, head circumference, and other somatic growth indicators measured daily [35] or weekly [34].",

In addition, we selected several outcomes to evaluate the impact of the two feeding strategies on infants from five aspects, including feeding performance, somatic growth, utilization of medical resources, feeding tolerance, and complications. Our study had several limitations. First, gestational age was an additional significant variable. Nevertheless, we were unable to examine the effect of sex because there was none randomized-controlled trial reported outcomes by sex. Second, the type of gastric tube was another significant variable that we cannot detect its effect as only a limited number of studies reported outcomes by the type of gastric tube. Third, our study was short of evaluation of other aspects such as pulmonary function [28], splanchnic perfusion [11], and laboratory outcomes because a limited number of studies reported these outcomes.",
