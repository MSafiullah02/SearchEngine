            "text": "Conversely, prophylaxis for the prevention of VTE is not without its own risks. Anticoagulation in any form increases the risk of bleeding. This is especially problematic given the known increased risk of bleeding in the peritraumatic period [11]. Fortunately, recommendations to address VTE prophylaxis in children have recently been published as a joint practice management guideline from the Pediatric Trauma Society and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (PTS/EAST) [12]. While these guidelines provide the first formal recommendations to address this clinical dilemma, implementation has been variable due to their basis in \u2018very low\u2019 level evidence and logistical challenges arising from reliance on retrospectively assigned Injury Severity Score (ISS). To bridge this gap, a group developed an algorithm [13] to predict VTE in pediatric trauma, derived from risk factors that are identified at admission or shortly thereafter. This VTE prediction tool was developed from 536,423 pediatric trauma patients sourced from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and was internally validated. Subsequently, a similar analysis of the NTDB was independently performed [14] using the same risk factors for VTE in children, confirming the utility of this approach. Despite internal validation and independent agreement, the VTE prediction algorithm has yet to be broadly implemented in clinical practice, likely due to the limitations of conclusions derived solely from large database studies.",

Patient GCS, age, sex, intubation, ICU admission, blood product transfusion, CVL placement, pelvic or lower extremity fracture, or major surgical procedure each contributed to their VTE risk score.

Each institution contributed data to the NTDB during the study. Inclusion criteria into both trauma registries were defined by the National Trauma Data Standard (NTDS) patient inclusion criteria [15]. Diagnoses and procedures were defined according to specific listed criteria or according to their International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9/10) code (eSupplemental Appendix 1). The first recorded hospital GCS was used in the risk score calculation. Intubation was determined according to ICD-9/10 codes corresponding to endotracheal intubation or the presence of at least one ventilator day. Transfusions were similarly determined based on ICD-9/10 codes corresponding to blood product transfusion or the specific reporting of product transfusion in the registry. Admission to the ICU was determined based on registry-defined length of stay in the ICU or reported disposition from the emergency department to the ICU. Central venous line placement, presence of a pelvic or lower extremity fracture and major surgical procedures were determined based on ICD-9/10 codes reported in the registries. Central venous lines contributing to the VTE risk score include upper and lower extremity centrally inserted catheters as well as peripherally inserted central venous catheters. Major surgery was inclusive of neurologic, thoracic, cardiovascular, hematologic, spleen, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, orthopedic or spine procedures and is enumerated in eSupplemental Appendix 1. Venous thromboembolism was defined according to the NTDS definitions [15] and determined based on registry defined reporting or an ICD-9/10 code corresponding to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. During the period of the study, each trauma center provided thromboprophylaxis based on admitting service; children greater than 12 years or 14 years, depending on the facility, were admitted to the adult trauma service and managed according to the adult VTE screening and prophylaxis protocol, all other children were admitted to the pediatric trauma service (ward or ICU) and received no standard management. The pediatric trauma services did not routinely provide VTE screening or prophylaxis to any patient, whereas the adult trauma services employed both ultrasound screening and pharmacologic prophylaxis to institutionally defined \u2018high-risk\u2019 patients. \u2018High-risk\u2019 patients on the adult trauma service were categorized as such if they suffered traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, a pelvic fracture, multiple or open extremity fractures, multiple rib fractures or flail chest, or required prolonged mechanical ventilation, multiple blood product transfusions, or femoral vein catheterization. These patients wore bilateral lower extremity sequential compression devices, began prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous injection daily, and received bilateral lower extremity screen venous duplex studies on hospital day 3 and every 7 days thereafter.",

While the overall incidence of VTE in pediatric trauma is relatively rare and variably reported [16], it has become increasingly clear that older children and adolescents have risk approaching that of their adult counterparts (estimated incidence in adolescents of 1.0\u20135.1%) [17]. Regardless, a void of high-level evidence in the pediatric surgical literature remains. In the only reported prospective study of VTE in critically injured children, Hanson et al. [18] describe the successful implementation of a clinical guideline to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolic disease suggesting the possible efficacy of a screening and prophylaxis regimen. However, due to the non-randomized quality improvement nature of this initiative\u2014including the implementation of selective ultrasound surveillance, mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis\u2014the efficacy of any individual intervention is difficult to determine. Recently, following an exhaustive systematic review on the topic, a joint practice management guideline published by PTS/EAST recommended \u201cpharmacologic prophylaxis be considered for children older than 15 years old and in younger postpubertal children with Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 25\u201d. Unfortunately, due to the inherent limitations in studying this population, these recommendations were developed from \u2018very low\u2019 level evidence and reliant upon calculation of the ISS for implementation, making them difficult to employ clinically.",

In the past, the NTDB has been criticized for underreporting complications [19] and is noted for having a considerable amount of missing data [20]. To address these concerns, our retrospective study demonstrates the efficacy of the VTE prediction algorithm in an external cohort of more closely maintained registries from two Level I trauma centers, each of whom separately report complications. This practice suggests higher fidelity of data in these registries over historical norms [20, 21].

While a sensitivity of 60% is considerably low for a potential screening test, various VTE risk score cutoffs can be determined to optimize the value of the tool and localize the ideal point of prophylactic intervention. For instance, the risk of major bleeding following pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in children has been reported at 2.3% [22]. If this is the most significant counterpoint to the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis, a VTE risk score cutoff corresponding to this risk could be set as the point of prophylaxis. We offer two additional possible points for intervention: (1) maximizing sensitivity and specificity\u2014an ideal screening test, but sacrificing a decreased positive predictive value, or (2) maximizing positive predictive value\u2014identifying those who are the highest risk for VTE, but sacrificing sensitivity. Currently, prospective implementation of the VTE risk tool is ongoing at our institution using the moderate- or high-risk cutoffs (VTE risk score > 523) published in the index study [13] as an inflection point for prophylactic intervention. Use of the moderate-risk cutoff was chosen for future implementation of VTE risk score at our institution, because the positive predictive value at that cutoff is approximately 5%, which approximates the risk of complications with prophylactic anticoagulation in this population.",

Notably, in patients where data are available, approximately 10% of all injured children received pharmacologic prophylaxis. Among these, the incidence of VTE was 2%, considerably higher than the incidence within the entire cohort. Presumably, this is a highly selected cohort, predominantly based on the criteria of age and clinical risk factors. Nevertheless, as prophylaxis is used to prevent future occurrences, we can assume that at least some proportion of those who received prophylaxis were prevented from developing VTE leading to an underrepresentation of incidence in our cohort. The exact proportion of prevented occurrences, however, is debatable. Multiple randomized control trials [23] have failed to demonstrate effectiveness of pharmacologic prophylaxis against thrombosis in the pediatric population. Data in adults however are clear, demonstrating that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduces clinically significant VTE by 70% [24]. If we assume that the effectiveness of pharmacologic prophylaxis in children is somewhere in the middle of these, then we might suspect that at the most, prophylaxis provides 35% relative risk reduction in VTE meaning that 3.1% (rather than 2%) of those who received prophylaxis would develop VTE, meaning a total of 26 patients rather than 16, or 10 additional patients would have VTE. Ultimately, inclusion of patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis in our study might have led to underestimation of the incidence of VTE by 30% at most.",

Furthermore, given the low incidence of VTE in the population, the analysis of AUROC, as we performed, tends to overestimate the efficacy of such diagnostic tests. However, despite the small sample size, we demonstrate a number of important findings that should provoke future investigation. Additionally, since both institutions in this study contributed data to the NTDB during the study period, it is likely that some of the patients evaluated in the application study were used to derive the model. This could be viewed as a circular analysis but because both institutions were not ACS-verified pediatric trauma centers until 2015, pediatric data used to create the model from these centers were likely incomplete. Our analysis, with electronic medical record data abstraction for all cases, additionally verified all of the case-level data in the registries, reflecting a more real-world application of the model. Specific VTE screening protocols by each adult trauma service create an additional source of confounding, as there is significant overlap in the \u2018high-risk\u2019 criteria at each institution and the clinical characteristics used to support our model, leading to possible artificial inflation of the AUROC. Another limitation of our study is the use of institutional trauma registries to gather data. Trauma registries are known for surveillance bias, the inability to temporally associate risk factors and outcomes, large proportion of missing data and for significant error rates, from 0.4\u20135.2% [25] in a recent study. These limitations likely contribute to both underreporting of risk factors as well as incidence of VTE, limiting the application of our analysis. However, given the low incidence of pediatric traumatic VTE, a retrospective review of institutional trauma registries, with selected case validation through dedicated data abstraction, represents the best forum for analysis of this data, prior to a safe prospective validation study. Lastly, as the institutional usage of anticoagulation in our population has varied based on the patients\u2019 age and a sizable portion of this data is missing (66%), the true incidence of VTE in this population is likely masked by a variable use of prophylaxis.",
