The coronaviral genome consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA with a size of about 30 kb, representing the largest viral RNA genome (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). Two thirds of the genome (two large open reading frames (ORF1a and 1b)) encode the replication machinery. ORFs 2, 4, 5 and 6 encode the structural proteins S (spike protein), E (envelope protein), M (membrane protein) and N (nucleoprotein), respectively (Masters, 2006). The FCoV ORFs 3 and 7 encode the accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b with unknown functions (Haijema et al., 2004, Dye and Siddell, 2005).",

While type I FCoV accounts for the vast majority of infections in the field (Rottier, 1999), type II FCoV is less common. About 5\u201310% of FCoV infected cats sporadically develop FIP, mostly within the first two years of their life (Pedersen, 2009).

Special attention was paid to aa position 1045 (nt 23535 of the complete genome of reference strain Black (EU186072)) within the putative fusion peptide which was found to be a hotspot for differentiation between FECV and FIPV biotype (Chang et al., 2012). 10 FECV (FECV-2, -4, -5, -12, -13, -14, -16, -17, -18 and -19) and 13 FIPV (FIPV-1F, -1A, -2A, -3F, -3A, -7F, -14F, -15F, -15A, -16F, -17A, -17F and -18A) samples were analyzed. All but one (FECV-16) FECV samples harboured an A residue leading to methionine (M), while all but one (FIPV-3A) ascites-derived FIPV samples displayed a T residue resulting in leucine (L). Three faeces-derived FIP viruses (FIPV-14F, -15F and -17F) encode methionine (M) at the respective position just like the FECV samples (Table 5).",

An intriguing finding within this study is that viruses with a mutated 3c gene could not only be found in ascites but also in the respective faecal samples of FIP animals (FIPV-8, -9 and -18). This is surprising in the light of a recent study where FIPVs with a mutated 3c were not shed in the faeces after either oronasal or intraperitoneal inoculation (Pedersen et al., 2012). Furthermore, we could detect viruses with an intact 3c gene but mutations within the S protein gene (M1045L) in both faeces and ascites (FIPV-1) or only in the faecal sample (FIPV-3).",

In conclusion, the data obtained in this study support the \u201cinternal mutational theory\u201d rather than the \u201ccirculating virulent/avirulent FCoV\u201d hypothesis. However, the significance of specific mutation events in the generation of FIPV needs to be further evaluated using reverse genetic systems for both serotype I and II feline coronaviruses followed by animal experiments (Tekes et al., 2008, Tekes et al., 2010, Tekes et al., 2012).",
