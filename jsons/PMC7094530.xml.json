Mathematical models are being used to predict how the disease will spread over a period of time. In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop realistic mathematical models for investigating the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and the asymptotic behaviors of these epidemic models are studied [10], [11], [42], [62]. Vaccination and antiviral drugs are the two most effective pharmaceutical interventions used for the control of an infectious disease. But due to strain's novelty most people may lack innate immunity to the disease, available vaccine may not provide protection against the pathogen and effective antiviral drug may not be available in sufficient amount. For example, Bird flu viruses H5N1 and H7N9 that have sporadically infected humans, could, with a few mutations to a key protein on their surface, become capable of infecting cells along the human upper airway and thereby take a step towards turning into pandemic-causing strains [50], [51]. In that scenario, the role of isolation, quarantine and other non-pharmaceutical interventions stimulated by media coverage becomes more significant as disease control strategies.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) reported that among persons >60 years old, 33% have pre-existing, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the new virus of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [58]. Phylogenetic analyses on the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus demonstrated its close relationship with the 1918\u20131919 Spanish H1N1 virus [15], [59]. Low virulence of the virus and pre-existing immune status are among the main factors that account for lower death rates in influenza outbreaks [58]. Pre-existing immunity is an important factor countering the pandemic potential of an emerging infectious disease. Thus, studying of pre-existing immunity will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis and disease dynamics of the emerging pathogen.",

            "text": "When an infectious disease breaks out in a population, people's response to the threat of the disease is dependent on their perception of risk, which is affected by public and private information disseminated widely by the media [28], [36], [49]. Media coverage about an epidemic gives a sense about the risk level and the relative need for precautions in risk areas and encourage the public to take precautionary measures against the disease such as wearing masks, avoiding public places, avoiding travel when sick, frequent hand washing, etc. Massive news coverage and fast information flow can generate a profound psychological impact on public health [55]. This is extremely important in the early stages of an epidemic, when pharmaceutical interventions are not often possible because treatment or vaccination options have not yet been developed [47]. Media coverage and education may reduce the contact rate of human beings and the use of NPIs may reduce the transmission probability. Many researchers investigated the impact of media awareness using mathematical modeling [2], [7], [8], [14], [22], [23], [26], [28], [30], [31], [32], [34], [36], [43], [47], [48], [49], [52], [53], [55], [57], [61]. One method is to form an information set summarized by a new state variable, mostly based on the publicly available information on both present and on the recent past spreading of the disease [2], [30], [31], [32], [43]. The population is broadly classified as educated and non-educated to reflect the awareness through media coverage [30], [31], [32], [43]. Complex network model is used to model media effect by Wang et al. and Yuan et al. [53], [61]. Liu et al. proposed an EIH model where H denotes hospitalized individuals assuming transmission coefficient of the form \u03b20=\u03b2e\u2212\u03b11E\u2212\u03b12I\u2212\u03b13H\n[28]. Possible multiple outbreaks and sustained periodic oscillations of the infection were observed. Cui et al. used similar transmission coefficient and established that multiple positive equilibria are possible when the media effect is sufficiently strong [7]. Reduction function of the negative exponential form to describe the reduction factor either by large number of infectious cases or by significant change in the number of infectious cases is used to model the media coverage [48], [57]. Cui et al. [8] proposed a general contact rate, \u03b2(I)=c1\u2212c2f(I), to reflect some intrinsic characters of media coverage. Using the same contact rate proposed by Liu and Cui [26], Tchuenche et al. [49] studied the impact of media coverage on the spread and control of an influenza strain. Sun et al. [47] used similar non-linear contact rate as in [8] to study media-induced social distancing in a two patch setting. Li and Cui [23] studied the effect of constant and pulse vaccination on SIS epidemic models incorporating media-induced incidence function similar as in [26], [49].",

            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases have devastating impacts on public health and impose great financial burden on the community, which attracts a major concern to public health agency. So it is of great importance to evaluate optimal methods for controlling these diseases [46]. Historically, quarantine (of individuals feared exposed to a communicable disease) is one of the oldest public health control measures for the spread of communicable diseases. These measures have been successfully applied dating back to the plague epidemic of the 13th century, to the influenza epidemics of the 20th century. More recently, this measure was successfully used to combat the spread of some emerging and re-emerging human and animal diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18], [25], [29], [33], [54], [60], foot-and-mouth disease [21] and the 2009 swine influenza pandemic [17]. The SARS outbreaks of 2003 provided an important example of a novel disease that was effectively controlled using quarantine and isolation [18], [25], [29]. Implementing these measures, however, can inflict significant socio-economic and psychological costs. Public health officials need to be able to present comprehensive, understandable assessments of the options to other government officials in a timely manner [37]. For the purpose of this study, quarantine means the removal of individuals suspected of being infected (yet exhibiting no clinical symptoms) from the general population. Thus, these individuals could be asymptomatically-infected or susceptible. On the other hand, isolation refers to the removal of infected individuals exhibiting clinical symptoms of the disease. Although isolation is probably always a desirable public health measure, quarantine is more controversial. Mass quarantine can inflict significant social, psychological, and economic costs without resulting in the detection of many infected individuals [9]. Isolation is primarily used for controlling the disease when it suddenly emerges or reemerges [5]. A successful example is the isolation of those infected with SARS during 2003\u20132004. However, the disadvantages of this strategy are the difficulty of detecting infected individuals and the cost of isolation. In general, to achieve perfect isolation is difficult at large scale resulting in a leaky isolation causing nosocomial infections.",

The total population at time t\u02dc, denoted by N\u02dc(t\u02dc), is sub-divided into six mutually exclusive compartments of susceptible (S\u02dc(t\u02dc)), exposed (E\u02dc(t\u02dc)), quarantined (Q\u02dc(t\u02dc)), infectious (I\u02dc(t\u02dc)), hospitalized (H\u02dc(t\u02dc)) and recovered (R\u02dc(t\u02dc)) individuals, so that N\u02dc(t\u02dc)=S\u02dc(t\u02dc)+E\u02dc(t\u02dc)+Q\u02dc(t\u02dc)+I\u02dc(t\u02dc)+H\u02dc(t\u02dc)+R\u02dc(t\u02dc). In the modeling of infectious diseases, the incidence function plays a very important role, it can determine the rise and fall of epidemics [42]. In many epidemic models, the bilinear incidence rate \u03b2\u02dcS\u02dcI\u02dc and the standard incidence rate \u03b2\u02dcS\u02dcI\u02dc/N\u02dc are frequently used, where \u03b2\u02dc measures the effect of both the infectiousness of the disease and the contact transmission rates. However, these incidence functions do not consider the impact of media coverage to the spread and control of infectious diseases. The media induced transmission rate \u03b2\u02dc(I\u02dc)=\u03b2\u02dce\u2212mI\u02dc, used in [7], [28], has two limitations. First, \u03b2\u02dce\u2212mI\u02dc\u21920 as I\u02dc\u2192\u221e, independent of the value of m. It is not reasonable since the media coverage is not the intrinsic deterministic factor responsible for the transmission and hence the transmission rate cannot be reduced below a certain level merely through media awareness and alert. Second, even for a fixed m, the minimum transmission rate differs for different population sizes, regardless the similarity in social structure (i.e., education and awareness level) and climatic condition.",

The parameters m1 and m2 represent the coefficients of media coverage using non-pharmaceutical interventions corresponding to infectious (I\u02dc) and isolated (H\u02dc) individuals, respectively. Now, the next important question is how to measure the media coefficient m. One innovative way of estimation of the media awareness coefficient m will be discussed in numerical simulation Section 5. Other modeling assumptions are as follows: The population grows at constant rate \u039b. Population in all the compartments decreases at rate \u03bc\u02dc due to natural death. Susceptible individuals acquire infection through effective contact with infectious individuals at rate(1)\u03b2\u02dce\u2212m1I\u02dc+m2H\u02dcN\u02dcS\u02dc(I\u02dc+\u03b7H\u02dc)N\u02dc. The parameter \u03b2\u02dc is the effective contact rate (that is, contact capable of leading to infection), while the modification parameter, 0<\u03b7<1, accounts for the assumed reduction in disease transmission by isolated individuals in comparison to non-hospitalized infectious individuals in the I\u02dc class. Thus, \u03b7 measures the efficacy of isolation or treatment given to hospitalized individuals (isolation is perfect if \u03b7=0; leaky if 0<\u03b7<1 and completely ineffective if \u03b7=1). The schematic flow diagram of the proposed model is shown in Fig. 2\n. Based on the aforementioned modeling assumptions, the proposed model is govern by the following system of ordinary differential equations:(2)dS\u02dcdt\u02dc=\u039b\u2212\u03bc\u02dcS\u02dc\u2212\u03b2\u02dce\u2212m1I\u02dc+m2H\u02dcN\u02dcS\u02dc(I\u02dc+\u03b7H\u02dc)N\u02dc+\u03b8\u02dcR\u02dc,\n(3)dE\u02dcdt\u02dc=\u03b2\u02dce\u2212m1I\u02dc+m2H\u02dcN\u02dcS\u02dc(I\u02dc+\u03b7H\u02dc)N\u02dc\u2212(\u03bc\u02dc+k\u02dc+\u03c3\u02dc+\u03be\u02dc)E\u02dc,\n(4)dQ\u02dcdt\u02dc=k\u02dcE\u02dc\u2212(\u03b1\u02dc+\u03be\u02dc+\u03bc\u02dc)Q\u02dc,\n(5)dI\u02dcdt\u02dc=\u03c3\u02dcE\u02dc\u2212(\u03b3\u02dc1+\u03d5\u02dc+\u03bc\u02dc+\u03b4\u02dc1)I\u02dc,\n(6)dH\u02dcdt\u02dc=\u03b1\u02dcQ\u02dc+\u03d5\u02dcI\u02dc\u2212(\u03b3\u02dc2+\u03bc\u02dc+\u03b4\u02dc2)H\u02dc,\n(7)dR\u02dcdt\u02dc=\u03b3\u02dc1I\u02dc+\u03be\u02dcQ\u02dc+\u03b3\u02dc2H\u02dc+\u03be\u02dcE\u02dc\u2212(\u03bc\u02dc+\u03b8\u02dc)R\u02dc; with initial conditions: S\u02dc(0)=S\u02dc0>0, E\u02dc(0)=E\u02dc0>0, Q\u02dc(0)=Q\u02dc0>0, I\u02dc(0)=I\u02dc0>0, H\u02dc(0)=H\u02dc0>0, R\u02dc(0)=R\u02dc0>0.

Thus the vector field on each bounding hyperplane of R+6 is pointing inward direction of R+6. Hence all the solution trajectories initiating in R+6 will remain inside R+6 for all the time. This establishes the fact that R+6 is positively invariant for the system (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7). Also, the total population N\u02dc(t\u02dc) satisfies dN\u02dcdt\u02dc=\u039b\u2212\u03bc\u02dcN\u02dc\u2212\u03b4\u02dc1I\u02dc\u2212\u03b4\u02dc2H\u02dc. Then, dN\u02dcdt\u02dc<\u039b\u2212\u03bc\u02dcN\u02dc, applying Birkhoff's and Rota's theorems on differential inequality [1], [45], as t\u02dc\u2192\u221e, we have 0\u2264N\u02dc(t\u02dc)\u2264\u039b\u03bc\u02dc=N\u02dc0.

The value of I\u204e is given by the solution of the equation(15)1\u2212b5I\u204e=emI\u204eRC. In case, there is no media effect, i.e., m=0, we get I\u204e=1b5(1\u22121RC). It follows that I\u204e exists at positive level (and so as the unique endemic equilibrium E\u00af) if and only if RC>1. Otherwise, the value of I\u204e is given from Eq. (15). Now we establish the existence of I\u204e for RC>1 though graphical approach. In Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n, we plot the curve emI\u204eRC and straight line 1\u2212b5I\u204e against I\u204e in the range [0\u20131]. Note that since b5>1, we have 1/b5<1. From Fig. 3, it follows that there is no point of intersection when RC\u22641, resulting the non-existence of the endemic equilibrium, but as RC>1, I\u204e exists uniquely at positive level and hence the unique endemic exists in this case (see Fig. 4).",

On the other hand, if \u03b7<\u03b7k, then due to increase in the rate of quarantine, the effective reproduction number RC will increase and consequently, the disease burden also increases.

If people are not responding to media alert, then qj=1 and if all the people are adopting the recommended NPIs, then qj=0. It is assumed that the disease transmission rate can be reduced by p fraction when all individuals follow the media recommended NPIs to protect themselves.

The main mathematical and epidemiological findings of the proposed model presented in this article are as follows:(i)The model (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) has a locally\u2013asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated effective reproduction number is less than unity (Theorem 3.1). Moreover, if the disease-induced death rates are neglected then the DFE is globally\u2013asymptotically stable (Theorem 3.4).(ii)The model has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever the effective reproduction number exceeds unity and then EE is locally asymptotically stable (Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.3).(iii)The presence of pre-existing immunity (\u03be\u02dc) in the population has significant impact on the transmission dynamics of the disease. Higher level of pre-existing immunity in the population decreases the infection peak and causes its early arrival.(iv)The coefficients of media awareness m1 and m2 do not affect the effective reproduction number RC. Hence, it does not change the qualitative behavior of the model, but it helps to mitigate disease burden by lowering the level of infection over time.(v)The use of quarantine and/or isolation could have positive, no or negative population level impact depending on the relative infectiousness of isolated individuals (\u03b7).(vi)Since disease transmission is directly related to the effective reproduction number, and the disease prevalence is directly related to the endemic equilibrium point E\u00af, specifically to the magnitude of I\u204e, therefore normalized forward sensitivity indices of the effective reproduction number and I\u204e will be helpful to determine decisive parameter(s) for containing the infectious disease. Sensitivity indices of the effective reproduction number and I\u204e are calculated and highly sensitive parameters are discovered.\n",
