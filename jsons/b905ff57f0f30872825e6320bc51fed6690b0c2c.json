The structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structures through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 and its time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, age distribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancing measures -workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown -and their efficacy with duration is then investigated. A three-week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for the reduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures. Our study underlines the importance of age and social contact structures in assessing the countryspecific impact of mitigatory social distancing.",

In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing has emerged as the most widely adopted strategy for its mitigation and control [1] . The suppression of social contact in workplaces, schools and other public spheres is the target of such measures. Since social contacts have a strong assortative structure in age, the efficacy of these measures is dependent on both the age structure of the population and the frequency of contacts between age groups across the population. As these are geographically specific, equal measures can have unequal outcomes when applied to regions with significantly differing age and social contact structures. Quantitative estimates of the impact of these measures in reducing morbidity, peak infection rates, and excess mortality can be a significant aid in public-health planning. This requires mathematical models of disease transmission that resolve age and social contact structures.",

We use it to study the impact of the most common social distancing measures that have been initiated to contain the epidemic in India: workplace non-attendance, school closure, \"janata curfew\" and lockdown, the latter two of which attempt, respectively, complete cessation of public contact for brief and extended periods. We emphasise that models that do not resolve age and social contact structure cannot provide information on the differential impact of each of these measures. This information is vital since each of the specific social distancing measures have widely varying economic costs. Our model allows for the assessment of the differential impact of social dis-tancing measures. Further, both morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19 infection have significant differences across age-groups, with mortality increasing rapidly in the elderly. It is necessary therefore to estimate not only the total number of infections but also how this number is distributed across age groups Our model allows for the assessment of such age-structured impacts of social distancing measures.",

Age distributions are sourced from the Population Pyramid website [3] and social contact structures from the stateof-the-art compilation of Prem et. al. [2] obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation. We show that even with equal probability of infection on contact, the differences in age and social contacts in these three countries translate into differences in the basic reproductive ratio R 0 . In Section (III) we study the progress of the epidemic in the absence of any mitigation to provide a baseline to evaluate the effect of mitigation. In Section (IV) we investigate the effect of social distancing measures and find that the three-week lockdown that commenced on 25 March 2020 is of insufficient duration to prevent resurgence. Alternative protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation can reduce the infection to levels where social contact tracing and quarantining may become effective. Estimates of the reduction in morbidity and mortality due to these measures are provided. We conclude with a discussion on the possibilities and limitations of our study. An appendix provide details of our mathematical model and the social contact structure.",

As noted in [2] , the features common to all three are the diagonal dominance, reflecting contact within age groups (i.e. siblings and partners) and the prominent offdiagonals, separated by the mean inter-generation gap, reflecting contacts between age groups (i.e. children and parents). The principal difference in India is the presence of a third dominant diagonal, again separated by the mean inter-generation gap, reflecting the prevalence of three-generation households. This quantifies the significant contact between children and grand-parents and the possibility of substantial of transmission of contagion from third to first generations. Such contacts are smaller in China and negligible in Italy. Panels (c), (f) and (i) show the contact C W ij between age groups in the workplace. In contrast to households, the work contact patterns are more homogeneous across age groups in all three countries, indicating that the workplace contributes to the transmission of contagion between age groups that are, otherwise, largely separated from each other in the household. The boundaries of these age groups are larger in India and China than in Italy. The matrices C S ij for schools (shown for India in the appendix) are strongly assortative, with primary contacts within the school-going ages and smaller contacts between age groups reflecting student-teacher interactions. The matrices C O ij for other spheres of contact (shown for India in the appendix) are strongly assortative, reflecting the preferential social contact within age groups in this sphere, but otherwise do not show systematic patterns. In summary, then, in India the home provides the main channel of transmission between three generations, the workplace provides the main channel of (largely homogeneous) transmission between working age groups, the school the main channel of transmission within children and to a smaller extent between children and adult teachers, while other spheres of contact, due to the assortative mixing, contribute to transmission within age groups. Do these differences have a quantitative impact on the transmission of disease? We answer this affirmatively by comparing the basic reproductive ratio R 0 for each of these populations for an infectious disease with identical probability of infection on contact \u03b2 and rate of recovery \u03b3 for the age-structured SIR model described in Ap-pendix 1. These differences underline the importance of resolving the age and social contact structure of a population when forecasting the progress of an infection and the impact of social distancing measures. With this background, we now turn to our forecast for the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India.",

Though our model allows for infectives to be both asymptomatic and symptomatic, given the large uncertainty in estimating asymptomatic cases, we assume all cases to be symptomatic. A possible effect of this is to underestimate the severity of the outbreak. We then run the model forward in time to forecast the progress of the epidemic with results shown in Fig. (2) . Panel (a) shows the fit to case data available upto 25th March 2020 and a three-week forecast, in the absence of social distancing measures. The basic reproductive ratio is R 0 = 2. 10 . Panel (b) shows a five month forecast, again, in the absence of social distancing. The peak infection is reached at the end of June 2020 with in excess of 150 million infectives. The total number infected is estimated to be 900 million. Panel (c) shows the time-dependent effective basic reproductive ratio R eff 0 (t) which gives the dominant contribution to the linearised growth at any point in time. This number is greater than unity before peak infection and smaller than unity beyond peak infection. The serves as a useful measure of the local rate of change of infectives at any point in time. In Fig. (3) we provide estimates of (a) the morbidity and (b) the excess mortality from the unchecked spread of the epidemic. The fraction infected across age groups is the largest for the 15-19 year olds and least amongst the 75-79 year olds. However, due to the strong age-dependence in death rates, mortality is amongst the least for the 15-19 year olds and greatest for the 60-64 year olds. We emphasise that these numbers, alarming as they are, are counterfactuals, as mitigation measures are already in place of this writing. They do, however, point to the unbearable cost in human life that must be paid for the any lack of, or delay in, mitigatory action.",

We interpret the lockdown imposed from 25 March 2020 to remove all social contacts other than the household ones.

Such models become useful when reliable estimates of contact structures are available. We have combined our mathematical model with the stateof-the-art contact structure compilation of Prem et. al. [2] and empirical case data available till the 25 March 2020 to assess the impact of social distancing measures in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. Our principal conclusion is that the three-week lockdown will be insufficient. Our model suggests sustained periods of lockdown with periodic relaxation will reduce the number of cases to levels where individualised social contact tracing and quarantine may become feasible.",

This provides a lower bound on the number of morbidities and mortalities and the intensity and duration of the social distancing measures that are required for mitigation. Extensive testing of the popu-lation can provide data on the number of asymptomatic cases and this, when incorporated into our model, will provide more accurate estimates of the progress of the epidemic and the impact of mitigatory social distancing. More generally, there are uncertainties in all parameters of our model and these would translate into uncertainties in forecasts and estimates. These uncertainties can be reduced with better availability of case data and the uncertainties can be quantified through Bayesian error propagation analysis. The principal regional differences in India appear to be in the time of initiation of the infection and for the cases to reach the critical size where community transmission begins. Though our model is not spatially resolved, it can be applied region-wise by fitting it to regional case data.",

The number of infectives will have a negative rate of growth if R eff 0 (t) is reduced to below unity upon effecting the social distancing measures. Therefore, R eff 0 (t) is diagnostic of the instantaneous efficacy of social distancing measures and can be computed from the eigenspectrum directly. Assuming controls are imposed and relaxed periodically and over durations short compared to intrinsic relaxation times, the progress of the epidemic can be described as a series of rising and (possibly) falling exponentials with dominant time scales determined by the spectral radii of L and L (t) . To a first approximation, the dynamics of the rise and fall of infections with the removal and application of social distancing is governed by a pair of exponentials. The rising time constant is \u03b3(R 0 \u2212 1) while the falling time constant is \u03b3(R eff 0 (t on ) \u2212 1).
