Relief of breathlessness in a sitting or standing position compared to the recumbent position is referred to as orthopnoea. While increased venous return in the supine patient is well tolerated in individuals with a preserved heart function, this leads to pulmonary venous congestion, an increase in interstitial lung water and a subsequent reduction of lung capacities with resultant shortness of breath in patients with impaired heart function. Accordingly, patients with heart failure prefer to sit upright (e.g. supporting their back with pillows to achieve a maximum upright position) (Fig. 5.1). Conversely, placing the patient into a supine position may be used as a stress test to exclude respiratory distress due to heart failure or (pulmonary) fluid overload. A history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea characterized by repeated awakening due to breathlessness while sleeping in the recumbent position is a typical symptom of heart failure.",

Chest wall deformities such as kyphosis, scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, severe funnel (pectus excavatum) or pigeon-shaped (pectus carinatum) chests are associated with reduced lung capacities and resultant restrictive lung disease. A barrel-shaped chest is suggestive of the presence of underlying COPD and/or lung hyperinflation. Similarly, centripetal (abdominal) obesity may be associated with a reduction in chest wall compliance and lung capacities. Scars of previous thoracic surgeries indicate that the patient may have reduced lung capacities (e.g. due to lung resections). In patients with COPD, lung apices may be seen and palpated in the supraclavicular region. Enlarged intercostal spaces with bulging lung tissue are less frequently noted over the lateral chest wall during acute exacerbation in asthenic patients. Significant deformities of the chest due to trauma (e.g. \u201cstove-in chest\u201d) are rare, but, if present, they are associated with life-threatening/fatal lung and/or mediastinal injuries.",

While a pneumothorax results in elevation of the affected hemithorax, total lung collapse/volume loss leads to reduced chest wall expansion with the affected hemithorax lagging behind the contralateral side. In both pneumothorax and total lung collapse/lung collapse, chest wall expansions of the affected hemithorax are reduced.

            "text": "Patients with multiple rib fractures can present with an unstable chest wall (\u201cflail chest\u201d). This is particularly common in patients in whom several adjacent ribs of the anterior or lateral chest wall have fractured into one or more free pieces (Fig. 5.3). This chest wall segment then moves inwards during spontaneous inspiration and outwards during expiration delicately compromising chest wall mechanics and possibly gas exchange (which is usually impaired due to concomitant underlying lung damage or contusion; see Fig. 5.3). In patients with large freely moving chest wall components, a mediastinal shift (or \u201cflutter\u201d) may occur with changes of intrathoracic pressures over the respiratory cycle and cause additional hemodynamic instability. In most cases, an unstable chest can be recognized by inspection of the (anterior or lateral) chest wall. Palpation with the examiner\u2019s palms placed over the anterior and lateral chest wall helps to detect smaller flail segments. In mechanically ventilated patients, positive airway pressure prevents the free chest wall part from moving inwards during inspiration, thus stabilizing the chest wall. In these patients, freely moving chest wall parts can only be detected by meticulous palpation. Abnormal or paradoxical chest movements may be observed in patients after cardiac surgery with sternal infection and instability. In some of these patients, partial or total sternectomy with muscle flap reconstruction is performed leaving them with a chronic unstable chest which is obvious on clinical inspection, as the muscle flap typically moves inwards during inspiration and outwards during expiration.",

            "text": "Central cyanosis characteristically affects the lips, oral/sublingual mucosa and tongue (Fig. 5.4). It reflects severe hypoxaemia but can also be seen in patients with meth- (>1.5 g/dL, brownish hue or \u201cchocolate\u201d cyanosis) or sulfhaemoglobinemia (>0.5 g/dL). Central cyanosis becomes visible if the absolute quantity of capillary/venular blood in the lips or oral mucosa exceeds 4.25 g/dL (>2.38 g/dL in the arterial blood) of deoxygenated haemoglobin. In non-anaemic patients, this corresponds to an arterial oxygen saturation of approximately 80%. Clinical recognition of central cyanosis can be tricky with false-positive and false-negative results. In anaemic patients, hypoxaemia must be more profound before central cyanosis develops. For example, in patients with a haemoglobin concentration of 7.5 g/dL (e.g. as may occur in patients in the intensive care unit), central cyanosis only becomes detectable when oxygen saturation drops to values <50% (again corresponding to a concentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin of at least 4.25 g/dL in mucosal capillaries). In severe anaemia, central cyanosis may not be detected clinically despite the presence of severe hypoxaemia. Finally, skin complexion can affect the threshold at which central cyanosis is detected. In patients with dark complexed skin and lips, it is more practicable to inspect the oral (sublingual or buccal) mucosa and tongue for the presence of central cyanosis (Fig. 5.4b). Patients with polyglobulia (e.g. those with COPD) may appear cyanosed already at mildly reduced arterial oxygen saturations. Pseudocyanosis (central cyanosis without hypoxaemia) can result from chronic metal intoxication (e.g. silver, gold) or complicate long-term drug therapies (e.g. amiodarone, minocycline, chloroquine, phenothiazines). Facial plethora with diffuse erythema of the upper chest is a clinical sign of acute hypercapnia (Fig. 5.5).",

            "text": "The respiratory rate is determined by counting the number of chest wall expansions over 20\u201330 s and then multiplying it to attain the number of breaths per minute. A respiratory rate between 10 and 15 breaths per min is physiologically normal in the resting individual. Except in some elderly patients, in whom respiratory rates may physiologically reach 25 breaths per min, any increase >20 breaths per min must be considered abnormal and referred to as tachypnoea. The degree of tachypnoea is a solid but non-specific indicator of disease severity with respiratory rates >30 breaths per min often associated with life-threatening conditions. Tachypnoea is more valid to predict subsequent cardiac arrest in hospitalized patients than tachycardia or abnormal arterial blood pressure. A persistently normal respiratory rate is, conversely, a useful finding that makes certain pathologies (e.g. shock, significant pulmonary embolism) rather unlikely. Physiologically, a rise in respiratory rate increases alveolar ventilation, carbon dioxide elimination and alveolar oxygen tension. Tachypnoea can therefore not only be observed in (acute) lung disease but also in patients with reduced systemic oxygen delivery and metabolic acidosis. Despite this, tachypnoea, in clinical practice, correlates notoriously poorly with the degree of hypoxaemia. Furthermore, ventilation can be stimulated by increased sympathetic tone (e.g. pain), inflammation (e.g. sepsis) and cerebral dysfunction (e.g. cortical or midbrain lesions). Unlike most other patients, patients with metabolic acidosis first increase their alveolar ventilation by an increase in tidal volume and only later by an increase in respiratory rate. This form of tachypnoea is referred to as hyperpnoea and is physiologically the most effective way to eliminate carbon dioxide via the lungs as dead space ventilation is minimized. Although in some cases, an increase in tidal volumes may be evident as \u201cKussmaul\u201d breathing, increased minute ventilation in patients with metabolic acidosis is difficult to recognize. It often only becomes apparent when surprisingly low pH ranges have been reached. As very low (<7.1\u20137.2) pH values are most often caused by anion gap acidosis (mostly of diabetic origin), the most common causes of hyperpnoea include ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, poisoning (e.g. salicylate, toxic alcohols, carbon monoxide, cyanide, isoniazid, paraldehyde, iron) and uraemia.",

Once stridor can be heard, complete obstruction is of imminent concern, particularly in situations when stridor develops rapidly (e.g. in patients who re-bleed after carotid surgery, have anaphylaxis, inhaled a foreign body or in whom subcutaneous emphysema spreads rapidly). Before stridor is heard, it can be perceived using a stethoscope placed over the neck (Fig. 5.14). The volume of an inspiratory stridor does not correlate with the degree of airway obstruction as it also depends on the velocity of inspiratory airflow. This is essential because the volume of a stridor often decreases as the patient decompensates and can no longer generate large enough airflows to pass through the airway stenosis. Clinical symptoms frequently preceding stridor include problems swallowing, a feeling of neck swelling and/or that something is blocking the airway and a change in voice. Notably, any change in voice in an acutely unwell or critically ill patient must be taken seriously as it may be a symptom of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g. airway compromise, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, aortic aneurysm).

Acute pulmonary oedema is, in its early stages, often associated with a quite distinctive non-productive, superficial, staccato-like cough. With increasing severity of pulmonary oedema, coughing occurs following almost each inspiration. Physiologically, cough in patients with pulmonary oedema is thought to arise from stimulation of interstitial juxtacapillary receptors (J-receptors) by increased lung water. These receptors may also be involved in the coughing response to pulmonary embolism, barotrauma/pneumothorax, lung hyperinflation (e.g. recruitment manoeuvre) or re-expansion of atelectasis (e.g. after drainage of a large pleural effusion). A similar cough as with early pulmonary oedema can be heard in patients with dysphagia who aspirate saliva or liquids (e.g. during the water swallow test). In patients with shock, particularly heart failure, the haemodynamic response to coughing can be used as an indicator of the underlying cardiovascular pathology. Prolonged arterial hypotension or even cardiovascular collapse in response to coughing or more frequently \u201cfighting the ventilator\u201d in a patient on catecholamine support is highly suggestive of right heart failure.

Depending where the examiner places the stethoscope, normal breath sounds differ in their character.

It is distinctly abnormal to hear bronchial breath sounds instead of vesicular breathing over the lung peripheries. Bronchial breathing occurs when patent airways are surrounded by fluid-filled or consolidated adjacent lung tissue, thus allowing for better transmission of breath sounds from the large bronchi to the lung peripheries. Common conditions in which vesicular breath sounds are replaced by bronchial breath sounds are pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or fluid overload states.",

This explains, for example, why only diminished breath sounds may be heard in obese patients or those with a small tidal volume [e.g. during shallow breathing or (lung protective) mechanical ventilation]. As often painfully experienced, the quality and type of the stethoscope can dramatically influence the perceived volume of breath sounds, too. When auscultating patients in the recumbent position, it is physiologic that less air enters the basal versus the upper parts of the lung physiologically, resulting in diminished breath sounds in dependent lung fields. This is especially pronounced during controlled mechanical ventilation where inspiratory airflow is generated by positive instead of negative pressure and air is mostly distributed to non-dependent lung areas.",

            "text": "Furthermore, several pathologic conditions (e.g. emphysema) can reduce the volume of breath sounds. As no air enters collapsed lung tissues (atelectasis), (bronchial) breath sounds over these lung areas are diminished. As the breath sounds heard are transmitted from adjacent lung segments, substantial parts of the lungs (e.g. large parts of a lobe) need to be collapsed and unaerated before breath sounds cannot be heard anymore. Air or fluid in the pleural space also diminishes the intensity of breath sounds. In the majority of patients with a pneumothorax, pleural air evenly encases (and compresses) the lung. This leads to diminished and distant or, in a large pneumothorax, absent breath sounds over the affected hemithorax. Due to the aforementioned fact that breath sounds are transmitted from adjacent lung segments, breath sounds from the contralateral lung can be heard over the parasternal chest wall even in patients with a pneumothorax. Another important cause for absent breath sounds over one hemithorax is (unnoted) bronchial intubation and one-lung ventilation. Even though the amount of pleural fluid collections may be massive (e.g. in severe haemothorax), it is unusual that breath sounds are diminished or absent over the entire hemithorax. As fluid collects in the dependent areas of the pleural cavity, breath sounds are typically diminished or absent over these parts. Compression atelectasis commonly accompanies pleural effusions. In some patients, fine crackles are heard over the transition zone between compressed and aerated lungs and are indicative of the lung segments which open and collapse during each respiratory cycle. Differentiating between pleural effusion and atelectasis by auscultation alone is difficult. In awake and cooperative patients, it may help to test for transmission of voice. If the patient says \u201ceee\u201d and the examiner hears \u201caaa\u201d over the affected lung part, atelectasis rather than effusion is likely present. This phenomenon is referred to as aegophony and results from enhanced transmission of sound through consolidated or non-aerated lung tissue, in contrast to pleural fluid (may also be heard where fibrotic lung is present).",

            "text": "Crackles have formerly been referred to as crepitations or rales. Currently, the term crackle is the preferred terminology. Crackles refer to high-pitched, clicking or crackling non-musical breath sounds which are heard during inspiration. Depending on their occurrence during inspiration, they are divided into early or late crackles. Generally, crackles are produced by explosive opening of alveoli or distal airways during inspiration. Crackles heard during early inspiration result from the popping open of airways >2 mm in diameter and are lower-pitched than late or pan-inspiratory crackles. Early inspiratory crackles sound coarse and are encountered in patients with bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, COPD or bronchiectasis. Late- or pan-inspiratory crackles are finer, higher-pitched and result from opening of collapsed alveoli during inspiration. Alveolar diseases such as pneumonia, lung oedema or interstitial lung disease/fibrosis are characteristic pathologies resulting in late- or pan-inspiratory crackles. In contrast to lung oedema and interstitial lung disease/fibrosis, pneumonia results in localized crackles often accompanied by rhonchi (or retained secretions). While crackles resulting from alveolar pulmonary oedema have been compared to the sound of a strand of hair being rolled between the fingers, crackles in patients with interstitial lung diseases/fibrosis (e.g. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) have been compared to the sound made by Velcro being pulled apart. Interestingly, crackles cannot be heard in all patients with pulmonary fibrosis. This seems to depend on the underlying pathology of fibrosis, as crackles are heard in almost every patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (which causes fibrotic changes of the terminal bronchioli and alveoli) but only a minority of those with pulmonary fibrosis from sarcoidosis (which causes fibrotic changes alongside the bronchovascular bundle but not the terminal small airways).",

In patients with severe disease in whom oedema fluid spreads from the alveoli to more proximal airways, crackles together with expiratory rhonchi can be heard. In some patients with heart failure, basal crackles can be induced by changing the position from semi-recumbence to the supine position. In patients with pulmonary venous congestion, crackles can often be heard within a few minutes in the supine position.

Wheezing results from significant (>50%) narrowing of smaller airways. It can be localized or heard over both lungs. A localized wheeze is commonly monophonic (produced by a single tone) and results from the obstruction of a single (larger) airway, for example, by a tumour, mucus plug, foreign body or compression by a mediastinal mass. In few but notable cases, the distal opening of the endotracheal tube (without a Murphy\u2019s eye) directly faces the posterior wall of the trachea which intermittently obstructs the tube during expiration resulting in severe prolongation of expiratory airflow and a monophonic wheeze. Similarly, a monophonic wheeze can be heard over both lungs in patients with vocal cord dysfunction who present with asthma-like symptoms. A wheeze that can be heard over both lungs is usually polyphonic as it results from several tones due to narrowing of different sized and located airways (\u201cconcertus asthmaticus\u201d). Multiple conditions can cause airway narrowing, of which the archetypical is bronchoconstriction due to asthma or anaphylaxis. In critically ill patients, the most common conditions associated with a wheeze are COPD, pulmonary fluid overload and left heart failure. It is important to note that in severe small airway obstruction (e.g. severe asthma attack or COPD exacerbation) or with very low airflows (e.g. low tidal volumes in respiratory decompensation or (ultra)lung-protective ventilation), the volume of wheezing is reduced or even absent (\u201csilent chest\u201d).

A common palpation technique in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients is to place the examiner\u2019s palm on the upper sternum (Fig. 5.17). When large enough in amount, tracheobronchial secretions cause bubbling vibrations that can be felt through the chest wall, particularly during expiration. Less frequently and mostly only in asthenic patients can the much finer vibrations of lung oedema be felt when the palm is placed over the lower lateral chest wall (Fig. 5.18). Palpation is also useful to evaluate the symmetry of chest wall expansions. This can be done by placing both hands around the chest or over the subcostal angle (Fig. 5.19). Tactile fremitus refers to vibrations felt by the examiner with both palms placed over the chest as the patient speaks (e.g. saying \u201c99\u201d). As non-aerated lung tissue transmits vibrations better than aerated lung parts, tactile fremitus is more pronounced over consolidated as compared to aerated lung fields.

Development of subcutaneous emphysema in trauma patients (e.g. already at scene) or after surgery is often caused by a bronchial injury and significant air leak. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is an obvious clinical diagnosis as air commonly distributes to areas of the body where there is soft subcutaneous tissue (e.g. the face and in particular the eyelids\u2014Fig. 5.20). Pneumomediastinum can be felt by palpation of the jugulum and supraclavicular tissue. In clinical practice, it is most frequently encountered in postoperative cardiac or thoracic surgical patients.

In order to detect rib and sternal fractures, the chest wall is palpated for bony crepitus over both infraclavicular areas and the sternum (Fig. 5.22). Bimanual lateral compression of the mid- and lower chest induces localized pain in awake patients with rib fractures (Fig. 5.23). In unconscious or sedated patients, fractures of single ribs are difficult to diagnose, particularly if fractures are posterior. In spontaneously breathing patients, flail chest wall segments are discerned by placing the examiner\u2019s hands over the lateral and anterior chest wall while feeling for paradoxically moving segments (Fig. 5.24). In patients who are mechanically ventilated, flail chest wall segments cannot be palpated since flail segments do not move paradoxically as pleural pressure remains positive over the respiratory cycle. In these patients, all areas of the chest wall need to be meticulously examined by digital compression. Flail segments are identified by mobility and inward movement on compression. In case a mini-thoracotomy/thoracostomy is performed (Fig. 5.25), the lung can be palpated with the finger that enters the pleural cavity. The first information obtained is whether the lung is up or down (e.g. confirming the presence of pneumothorax). Although taking into account that only a very small area of the lung is palpated, the texture of the lung can give the examiner a rough idea of the lung injury. An uninjured or mildly traumatized lung feels tense like a balloon and quickly expands upon release of the pneumothorax. A severely contused lung feels slippery and has the consistency of a blood clot. Despite release of air from the pleural cavity, it does not expand at all or only incompletely and with a significant delay.",

A hyperresonant sound is higher in pitch, somehow \u201chollow\u201d (tympanic) and can be heard over a pneumothorax, large bullae or in patients with COPD. It is extremely helpful to confirm hyperresonance by comparing it to the percussion sound of the contralateral hemithorax. Percussion over pleural effusions or large lung consolidations results in a dull and short resonance. A \u201cstony dull\u201d percussion note typically implies a pleural effusion. While percussion to test for pneumothorax or total lung atelectasis is performed over the anterior chest wall, the posterior or lateral chest wall (in the sitting position) is percussed in case a pleural effusion or lung consolidation is suspected.

The clinical examination is crucial to recognize the anatomically and physiologically difficult airway and thus induce appropriate subsequent preparations. No clinical sign alone is sensitive or specific enough though. A reliable prediction of an anatomically difficult airway can be achieved by using the LEMON approach. This mnemonic stands for Look, Evaluate, Mallampati, Obstruction and Neck mobility. Clinical signs to be looked for are summarized in Table 5.4. Evaluation includes the 3-3-2 examination technique (Table 5.5 and Fig. 5.27). Although the Mallampati score was first described in the sitting patient during preoperative evaluation and has not been validated in critically ill patients, it is worthwhile assessing. The patient is asked to protrude the tongue as far as possible while saying \u201caah\u201d. The visibility of the soft palate and uvula is then inspected and graded into four classes (Fig. 5.28). While the chances for uncomplicated laryngoscopy and intubation are high in class one, the risk of a difficult laryngoscopy is significant in classes three and four. Neck mobility must only be assessed in patients without cervical spine instability and thus not in all critically ill patients, particularly not those in the pre-hospital setting or emergency department. The simplest way to confirm adequate neck mobility for laryngoscopy is to passively move the patient\u2019s head. Alternatively in awake patients, the patient can be asked to bend his head so that his/her chin touches the chest wall.",

Unless spontaneous ventilation is maintained during intubation, absence of chest movements and development or worsening of cyanosis despite ventilation must primarily be considered a sign of oesophageal tube misplacement. While delivery of breaths to the oesophagus with a ventilation bag can feel similar to delivery of breaths to the lungs, air is not expired or only at a much slower rate from the stomach/oesophagus than from the lungs. This is then typically associated with gurgling sounds. Entrance of gastric juice into the tube (be sure not to mistake it for lung oedema!) during expiration is another sign that is highly suggestive of oesophageal intubation (unless tracheal aspiration of gastric content has occurred before). Expiratory misting of the tube is usually absent in oesophageal intubation but has anecdotally been observed after large amounts of gastric air exit through the tube during release of positive pressure.",

The absolute criteria include sufficient spontaneous gas exchange, the presence of upper airway reflexes and adequate cough strength. Although several scores and cut-off values have been suggested to predict successful extubation, it is clinically difficult to apply single values to all patients. While it is fairly easy to assess adequate oxygenation with the use of arterial oxygen saturation and/or blood gas analysis on reasonable ventilator settings (FiO2 < 0.45(\u22120.5), PEEP < 7 cm H2O), evaluation of adequate spontaneous ventilation primarily relies on clinical skills. In clinical practice, this is achieved by close observation of the patient for signs of respiratory distress, an increased work of breathing or a pathologic breathing pattern either during a spontaneous breathing trial or on an augmented spontaneous ventilation mode. It is advisable to take at least 1 min or longer to observe the patient, particularly those who have been ventilated for several days. Although a respiratory rate < 25 breaths per minute on reasonable ventilatory support should be present in the majority of patients, some individuals can be extubated successfully at higher respiratory rates. These subjects are typically alert and have a poor tube tolerance or an underlying restrictive lung process necessitating higher respiratory rates. Finally, the patient\u2019s own estimation whether he or she can breathe without the tube often helps to predict whether the extubation will be successful or not.",

Indicators of an inadequate swallowing reflex in the non-responding patient are the presence of a saliva pool in the mouth, the frequent need for oral suctioning and/or saliva drooling from the mouth. Important to note is that these clinical methods only assess whether upper airway control is present but cannot be used to predict post-extubation dysphagia (see Part II Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-77365-0_5). Spontaneous coughing is a positive predictor of extubation success. The cough force can be tested by disconnecting the patient from the ventilator and asking him or her to cough forcefully (Fig. 5.30). Alternatively, coughing can be assessed by endotracheal suctioning. If the patient does not cough or coughs only with little force, clearance of secretions following extubation is likely to be insufficient. Finally, the frequency at which endotracheal suctioning is required needs to be taken into account.",

Recognition of the latter is essential as it commonly results in immediate respiratory decompensation after extubation or impaired airway control with an increased risk of delayed tracheal (micro)aspiration and pneumonia. The population at highest risk for residual neuromuscular blockade is critically ill patients after surgery. Important determinants are timing, type and dosage of the neuromuscular blockade agent administered. Hepatic and renal dysfunction can delicately impair the clearance of neuromuscular blocking agents and lead to a prolonged time to full recovery of neuromuscular capacity. Similarly, obesity is a clinical risk factor as patients typically receive higher doses although their muscle mass is only slightly increased. In addition, obese patients are specifically sensitive to any degree of residual neuromuscular blockade. Before extubation, an in-depth physical evaluation alone is not sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of residual neuromuscular blockade. This can only be achieved by quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (e.g. the train-of-four testing). When assessing the patient\u2019s muscular force, it needs to be taken into account that the diaphragm and pharyngeal musculature are exclusively sensitive to neuromuscular blockade and recover last. Therefore, recovery of full peripheral muscle strength (e.g. strong hand squeeze or ability to move extremities particularly in response to external stimuli such as suctioning) must not be used to exclude residual neuromuscular blockade. Similarly, an adequate tidal volume is a highly unreliable marker of full neuromuscular recovery. The best clinical method appears to be the ability to lift the head off the cushion or pillow for at least 5 s. If the patient is extubated despite (unrecognized) residual neuromuscular blockade, a typical clinical picture is seen. Patients immediately obstruct their airways or take shallow breaths which can only be elicited by twitchy movements of the accessory respiratory muscles. This often leads to synchronous small forward movements of the head and chin. Patients are awake, typically frightened and unable to speak.",

Given the high odds of false-negative results and the associated risk of unnecessarily prolonging mechanical ventilation, the cuff leak test should only be performed in a highly selected group of critically ill patients. During positive pressure ventilation, the cuff of the endotracheal tube is deflated and the examiner listens for gurgling sounds of air exiting next to the tube. It is important to make sure that the patient\u2019s head is placed in a neutral position as otherwise the position of the head can obstruct the upper airway, particularly in obese patients. An air leak should be audible at peak inspiratory pressures of 20 mbar or lower. The absence of an audible air leak during a correctly performed cuff leak test is a sensible indicator of upper airway compromise or obstruction. If an air leak can only be heard when the patient coughs (which is frequent after deflating the cuff) but not during assisted breathing, the cuff leak test must be considered negative. It should be noted, however, that if an air leak is present, it cannot be safely assumed that the upper airway will be uncompromised after extubation. Performance of the tube occlusion test can increase the predictive value of a positive cuff leak test. During this test, the tube is occluded while the balloon of the tube is still deflated. The patient is then asked to take a deep breath. If inspiration results in visible chest wall expansion, the risk that the upper airways are unobstructed is minimal.",

It is an important contributor to morbidity (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and mortality in these patients. Early recognition of dysphagia is essential. The clinical examination plays a crucial role as a screening tool to trigger definite diagnostic procedures typically including fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing or barium swallow. Inability of the patient to swallow resulting in retained oral saliva and secretions is a straightforward diagnosis. However, in the majority of patients with swallowing disorders, symptoms are more subtle. The water swallow test is a valid method with a moderate sensitivity but an acceptable specificity to diagnose dysphagia. The alert patient is placed in the sitting position and offered one or more sips (<20\u201330 mL) of water to drink. The swallowing process is closely observed for obvious dysfunction (e.g. multiple swallow attempts, water drooling from mouth, non-elevation of larynx) and the patient monitored for coughing, choking, change in voice or throat clearing. Any of these signs strongly suggests the presence of dysphagia and should lead to definite diagnostic tests. In patients with a tracheostomy, the water-swallowing test can be modified. The balloon of the tracheal tube is deflated and the patient offered coloured (e.g. with methylene blue) water to drink. The same observation as described with the standard water-swallowing test is then performed. At the end of the test, the patient is suctioned endotracheally and secretions inspected for the presence of coloured secretions. Sometimes the coloured water also exits from the tracheostoma site and confirms the diagnosis dysphagia.",
