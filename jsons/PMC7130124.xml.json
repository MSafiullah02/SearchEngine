The World Health Organization named this novel coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 11, 2020. COVID-19 is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome that can cause fever and serious respiratory symptoms, such as cough, wheezing, and dyspnea [[3], [4], [5]]. This novel coronavirus can quickly spread from person to person and can lead to widespread outbreaks when infected individuals travel to different areas or countries. With the celebration of Chinese New Year from January 24 to January 25, 2020, more than five million people left Wuhan, and some of them were infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), [6,7]. After a rapid increase in the number of new confirmed cases outside Hubei Province, all 31 provinces in mainland China (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) had reported COVID-19 cases. China was actively responding to the outbreak of the disease and implemented the national security strategy for COVID-19, which turned to so-called wartime control measures, and put cities in Hubei Province on lockdown on January 23, 2020 [8]. In other areas outside Hubei Province, the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 were unclear as well as whether wartime control measures were able to control the disease.",

All confirmed COVID-19 cases and suspected COVID-19 cases are temporarily isolated, detention for check-up and transferred to institutions designated by local health and family planning departments.\n7.The residential districts, townships (towns), as well as the neighborhood committees and village committees shall help the administrative departments of public health, medical institutions and other departments collecting and reporting outbreak information, scattering and isolating people, implementing public health measures.\n",

Before January 31, the number of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was more than that of close contacts. Since then, new cases per day were primarily composed of close contacts. The remarkably increased number of close contacts with SARS-CoV-2 indicated that people were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 was important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies [10,11]. This result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted in Jiangsu Province, and the second-generation transmitted cases appeared. The epidemiology of human infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Jiangsu was also found in other areas outside Hubei Province [12,13]. A few cases were confirmed whether residents or travelers to Hubei Province or close contacts. Finding out whether the cases were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in transportation facility or destination was difficult. Therefore, wartime control measures for COVID-2019, including limited population movements, were coercive but feasible [14]. One reported case on February 6 and another case on February 13 without exposure history to COVID-2019 in Wuxi was feared. This finding suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 might begin to spread in the community, and close communication with one another should be prohibited [15]. However, from February 19 to 27, no new cases were reported in Jiangsu Province. This result further indicated that wartime control measures, including limiting communication with one another implemented in Jiangsu Province, possibly prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

This result indicated that the people of Jiangsu and the people of Hubei had a frequent contact because of developed modern traffic, which brought certain difficulties in preventing and controlling COVID-199 [14,16,17]. People who arrived in Jiangsu before the implementation of wartime control measures were gradually diagnosed as suffering from COVID-2019 after the incubation period of COVID-2019. Therefore, a short peak of COVID-2019 appeared in each city. These cases were geographically concentrated in three large cities (Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Suzhou) with a high population density, which can accelerate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among the people [7]. However, no new case was confirmed on February 19, indicating that the implementation of wartime control measures resulted in reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",

Compared to MERS and SARS, SARS-Cov-2 has higher overall human-to-human transmission potential [19]. After the first confirmed case in Hubei province, soon the number of COVID-2019 cases exhibited signs of exponential increase with 78 824 confirmed cases, 2308 suspected cases and 2788 deaths so far [20]. It shows that the outbreak is still an epidemic threat in China. More seriously for China, each city facing a huge increase in people returning from trips after the Chinese Spring Festival vacation may result in recurrence of outbreak, despite wartime control measures have partly prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, wartime control measures should continue in China. With the development of convenient transport facilities, the intercommunications among countries are more frequent. The epidemic of COVID-2019 has also spread to other countries from China. Billions of people in 23 other countries including the USA, South Korea, Germany, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have been hugely threatened with the spread of 2019-nCoV. In light of measures introduced by China, limiting travel and trade might be an advisable option.",

This study showed that the number of new COVID-19 cases per day increased at first and then were gradually reduced to zero after the implementation of wartime control measures in Jiangsu Province. However, considerable attention should be paid to the peak of population mobility after the Spring Festival. Concrete information that can influence the epidemic of COVID-19, such as the source and destination of the floating population and the incidence of disease in each area, should be acquired.",
