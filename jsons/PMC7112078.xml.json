These small particles affect human health by causing infectious diseases, acute toxic reactions, and allergies (Gergen, 2011). Prevention and control measures for bioaerosols have attracted worldwide attention as a result of the recent pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza H1N1 (Zhang et al., 2010). Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems are used as commercial engineering controls to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases (Jensen et al., 1994). UVGI is an effective method of inactivating airborne microorganisms (Xu et al., 2005). Germicidal lamps containing mercury vapors under low pressure are a commonly used UV source for UVGI (Ryan et al., 2010).",

Higher UV sensitivity was observed at higher relative humidity according to Walker's study on MS2 Bacteriophage (Walker and Ko, 2007). Other than the species of microorganism and relative humidity (Xu et al., 2005), UV wavelength is also an important parameter determining the UV inactivation efficiency of bacterial aerosol. Maximum effectiveness is usually observed at around 254 nm (UVC) (Koller, 1952) and many studies have been conducted on the inactivation of airborne microorganisms by using UVC radiation. Inactivation performance under other UV wavelengths has also been explored. Kim and Jang (2018), for example, investigated several photocatalytic reactions by UVD (185 nm) with short irradiation times to inactivate airborne MS2 viruses. Araud et al. (Araud et al., 2018) also investigated the inactivation mechanisms of viruses via solar UVA and visible light. However, the inactivation performance of different UV sources, especially UVD, which can damage microorganisms by producing ozone in addition to UV irradiation, has rarely been compared. In addition, few studies have reported the energy efficiency of UVGI devices, which is also a factor to consider when choosing a UV source with which to conduct inactivation.",

Inactivation kinetics has been being studied since twentieth century (Crittenden et al., 2011). Reaction rates vary by one and one-half orders of magnitude for UV disinfection (Zhao et al., 2014). Utilization of the Chick-Watson model (Ryan et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2003; Kowalski and William, 2000) is the standard method for modeling the response of microorganisms to UVGI. In some cases, the two-stage curve (Noakes et al., 2015), such as Rennecker-Marinasis model (Crittenden et al., 2011) and Collins-Selleck model (Collins and Selleck, 1971), were used to describe the unusually high resistance of microorganisms to irradiation because many microbial decay curves exhibit a decay curve shoulder (time-delayed response) when exposed to UVGI. Most of the previous models were kinetic fitting of inactivation efficiency, while the present work takes mechanism of photoreaction into account, providing more insight into the process of UV inactivating bacteria.",

While the damage to DNA molecules brought about by UVA irradiation (Tang and Guo, 2005) is far less than that brought about by UVC, UVA still confers slight damage to the B-form backbone of bacterial DNA by cutting off phosphodiester bonds and disrupting the main spatial structure of DNA as well as affecting the thymine groups.",

The prediction results of the curve in Eq. (9) and the values measured at an exposure time of 10 s are shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). Straight lines with different slopes indicate that the influent concentration and UV average absorbed energy density have no effect on k, which coincides with the model.
