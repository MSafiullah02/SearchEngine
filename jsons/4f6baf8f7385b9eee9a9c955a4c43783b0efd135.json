            "text": "Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and is the leading cause of hospitalization of children younger than 1 year of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent virus responsible for bronchiolitis worldwide, followed by rhinovirus (HRV). [1, 2] New respiratory viruses such as human bocavirus (HBoV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have also been detected in infants and children with lower respiratory tract diseases. [3, 4] Approximately 30% to 70% of infants develop bronchiolitis after primary RSV infection and 1% to 3% of them are hospitalized. [5] Even though risk factors for hospitalization have been identified, the mechanism of severe bronchiolitis is not completely understood. [6] Infants who are affected with RSV or HRV bronchiolitis during their first months of life, frequently develop recurrent wheezing and asthma. [7, 8] Several mechanisms have been implicated to explain the different short and long term severity of bronchiolitis. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. [9] However, one of the most widely accepted theories attributes severe RSV-bronchiolitis to an imbalance in the Th1/Th2 immune response. [10] [11] [12] The principal Th1-cytokine, IFN-g, is likely to be the most important for cell-mediated immunity. [13] IFN-g inhibits allergic responses but may also contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness, especially in non-atopic subjects. [14] Although it is considered an important molecule in antiviral host defense, few studies have investigated its expression by airway epithelial cells. It has been this suggested that IFN-g may play an important role in eosinophilic inflammation in RSV bronchiolitis. [15] Th2 immune response is characterized by low IFN-g and IL-12 levels and higher IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 levels, as observed in the airways and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infants with RSV bronchiolitis. [16] IL-10 can downregulate cytokine production by Th1-like T-cells and inhibit antigen presentation through downregulation of class II major histocompatibility complex antigens on monocytes. [17] It is frequently elevated in nasopharyngeal secretions of RSV infected children [18] and may be related to subsequent development of chronic airway morbidity. [19] Recently, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelium-derived cytokine, has been identified as a key initiator of allergic airway responses. [20] It is considered a master Th2cytokine, as it promotes the differentiation of naive T0 cells into Th2 lymphocytes through the activation of antigen presenting cells. [21] Several studies have shown a strong link between TSLP expression and the production of Th2-associated effector cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNFa. [22] [23] [24] Furthermore, TSLP seems to play a pivotal role in the pathobiology of allergic asthma and it is expressed at elevated levels in the lungs of humans with asthma. [24] Rhinovirus infection induces, in mice models, TSLP, and IL-33 expression as well as TSLP-dependent upregulation of OX40L, and all 3 of these molecules contribute to the development of an adaptive immune response that is characterized by an altered balance between suppressive peripherally induced regulatory T cell (pTreg cells) and Th2 effector cells. [25] These findings might be a common response of some other respiratory viruses associated with allergic disease, as in mice initially infected as neonates, TSLP expression induced by RSV infection is an important upstream event that controls OX40L expression, lung dendritic cells migration, and Th2 polarization. [26] IL-33 is a member of the IL-1 family, which is a superfamily of cytokines mainly involved in early immune and inflammatory responses following infection. Unlike other interleukin 1 family members, IL-33 has been associated with the promotion of both systemic and localized Th2 cell responses. [27] Clinically, patients with mild to moderately severe asthma show increased nasal IL-33 levels following HRV inoculation and this increase correlates with symptom severity and viral load. [28] Periostin is a matrix cellular protein, and its synthesis in airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts is induced by interleukin IL-4 and IL-13. Periostin has been shown to be involved in many aspects of allergic inflammation, such as eosinophil recruitment, airway remodeling, development of a Th2 phenotype, and increased expression of inflammatory mediators. [29] However, so far there are no published studies that assess the expression of periostin in infants with bronchiolitis.",

It is worth highlighting that any infant in the control group and any patient with bronchiolitis but without any identifiable virus had detectable levels of nasal TSLP or IL-33. Our results support the possible role of these 3 proteins in the inflammatory response triggered by the most common respiratory viruses and not only by RSV, rhinovirus or hMPV, as has been previously described, mostly in experimental studies. [22, 26, [35] [36] [37] TSLP has been identified as a master switch for allergic inflammation in mouse models and it is an important cytokine in the development of allergic asthma. [38] Experimental studies comparing the TSLP response to RSV infection in bronchial epithelial cells from healthy and asthmatic children showed that cultures from asthmatic subjects displayed a significant increase in TSLP production, as compared to cultures from healthy subjects. [37] A recent report that showed how RSV induces upregulation of TSLP receptor in human airway epithelial cells (AEC), [39] suggests a possible role for RSV-infected AECs in initiating an autocrine/paracrine TSLP signaling circuit, that could contribute to a TSLP-driven inflammatory response associated with virus infection. [40] Mehta et al [25] found that experimental infection by rhinovirus upregulates TSLP in human lung epithelial cells and TSLP seems to be central to the inflammatory activity of rhinovirus. Moreover, it has been reported, also in experimental studies, that TSLP is critical for the development of the immunopathology induced by RSV, [37] as well as by hMPV. [35] In vivo studies, performed in young children with rhinovirus infection, have also found higher levels of nasal TSLP compared with subjects without any identifiable virus, in both term and preterm children. [41, 42] The concentrations of nasal TSLP in our naturally acquired infections series, were significantly higher, not only in RSV and rhinovirus infections, but also in PIV and adenovirus-infants with bronchiolitis. The highest levels of TSLP were identified, in our patients, in infants with RSV + HRV coinfections. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that infants with dual RSV + HRV infection were 9 times more likely to have detectable nasal TSLP and this association was independent of other factors such as age or illness severity. These findings suggest that the immunological response in acute bronchiolitis is partly dependent on virus-specific factors. Although other authors also found higher levels of nasal cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8) in infants infected with both RSV and HRV, [43] no previous study has evaluated the differential production of nasal TSLP in single versus dual Table 2 Nasopharyngeal aspirates proteins concentrations (pg/mL) from patients with single RSV, HRV, or dual RSV plus HRV infections. Proteins concentrations that are expressed as median (IQR). * * P-value calculated with the Kruskall Wallis test. HRV = rhinovirus, RSV = respiratory syncytial virus, TSLP = thymic stromal lymphopoietin. RSV and HRV infections. Furthermore, the role of coinfections in terms of clinical severity is still controversial. A recent study by our group in 1229 hospitalized children (599 RSV single infections, 510 single HRV infections and 120 RSV + HRV coinfections) found that patients with coinfections had more frequent fever \u2265 38\u00b0C and hypoxia than those with single RSV or single HRV infections. [44] Our results suggest that these clinical findings associated with severe RSV + HRV coinfections might be accompanied by a predominantly Th2 response, suggesting that these viral coinfections may lead to an altered mediator profile that biases towards a Th2 immune response. This hypothesis is also supported by the absence of significant differences in IFN-g levels (principal Th1 cytokine) between bronchiolitis and healthy infants and between simple versus dual infections. Another arising question is whether this stronger TSLP response in RSV + HRV coinfections might also be associated with higher incidence of recurrent wheezing later in life. Lukkarinen et al [45] recently reported that coinfection with HRV and HBoV1 resulted in a modified, non-Th2-type cytokine response, suggesting that HBoV1 may interfere with HRVinduced immune response. Furthermore, this immunological response was accompanied by the clinical finding that children with HRV + HBoV1 wheeze tended to develop recurrent wheezing later and less often than did those with HRV wheeze. Our results suggest that a virus-virus interaction may also occur in RSV and HRV coinfections, but in an opposite way, towards a predominant Th2 response. This shift in the immune response towards Th2 could favor the development of recurrent wheezing/ asthma. However, as far as we know, no previous study has evaluated the frequency of recurrent wheezing after viral bronchiolitis in RSV + HRV coinfection versus the single ones.",

[29, 46] In murine models, periostin has been associated with severe asthmatic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. [47] In humans, periostin has been found to prolong Th2/eosinophilic inflammation and to aggravate airway remodeling. [48] Levels of periostin reflect persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation in severe asthmatics despite a high dose of ICS. [46] In children, Lopez-Guisa et al [31] recently demonstrated significantly greater expression of periostin in bronchial and nasal epithelial cells from children with asthma compared to atopic nonasthmatic or healthy children. Prior to ours, no study has analyzed levels of periostin in infans with bronchiolitis. In our series, nasal concentrations of periostin were significantly higher in RSV, HRV, HBoV and hMPV-infected infants compared to healthy controls. Given the similarities in clinical manifestations between bronchiolitis and asthma, as well as the high frecuency of recurrent wheezing and asthma following an episode of bronchiolitis, [7, 8] the high level of nasal periostin found in infants with viral bronchiolitis might suggest the presence of eosinophilic inflammation even at a young age. Further longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate if these infants with higher levels of periostin during acute bronchiolitis will develop recurrent wheezing/asthma more frequently later in life.",

The neutralization of IL-33 completely abolishes the severe RSV disease phenotype in neonatal mice, whereas the administration of the cytokine during infection in adult mice results in exacerbated Th2-inflammation, lung dysfunction, and airway mucus. [49] Saravia et al [49] detected IL-33 in nasal secretions of infants with RSV infection whose levels decreased during convalescence, although a limitation of their study is the lack of a control uninfected group. Recently, Jackson et al [50] demonstrated for the first time that IL-33 is induced by rhinovirus in the asthmatic adult airway in vivo. These observations have important implications for the understanding of virus-induced asthma exacerbations and offer a mechanism through which respiratory viruses, that are classic Th1 triggers, might promote type 2 inflammation in susceptible individuals. [50] Our study reports for the first time, that other respiratory viruses, besides RSV and HRV, also elicited secretion of IL-33 in the airways of infants with bronchiolitis compared to healthy control children. In our series, as was the case of TSLP, no infant in the healthy control group had detectable levels of IL-33, supporting the role of viral infections in IL-33 induction.",

Nasal TSLP was also detected more often in infants who needed ICU admission, although the difference did not remain significant after logistic regression, probably because of the small sample size, as only 8 infants needed ICU admission.

Future studies are needed to elucidate the role of these respiratory viruses. There are also several strengths of this study. This is an in vivo study performed in naturally acquired viral infections in infants. Samples were prospectively collected, using rigorous methodology and identical collection procedures were employed in cases and controls.",
