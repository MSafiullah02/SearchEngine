The disease has advanced into a pandemic, started with small chains of spreading, further culminating into larger chains of spread in many countries resulting in the widespread transmission consequently across the globe affecting all the continents (Anderson et al., 2020) . The fatality case of COVID-19 risk is around 1% and that it can kill healthy adults, as well as the elderly people with, existing health problems (Gates, 2020) . According to Worldometers (2020) , 14 May 2020, with the total coronavirus cases rising to 4,490, 958, and total deaths 301,616, USA is the worst affected country from the COVID-19 pandemic with 86,098 deaths. It took 67 days from the first reported of COVID-19 to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000, and just four days for the third 100,000 (WHO, 2020a,b) . The accelerating spread of the COVID-19 and its outcomes around the world has led people to fear, panic, concern, and anxiety (Ahorsu et al., 2020) , panic buying of surgical masks , stigma, depression, racism, and xenophobia. Besides, as there is no medication and vaccination yet, wrong use of disinfectant liquids, methyl alcohols, garlic, lemon tea is amongst the many misinformation to cure COVID-19. Moreover, the fear of infection, quarantine, social isolation, a lack of self-care even leads individuals to suicide. Predictably, any contagious epidemic outbreak has deleterious effects on individuals and society (Duan and Zhu, 2020) .",

The government of Bangladesh (GoB) deployed armed forces from 24 March to facilitate the social-distancing and prevention of the disease. Emergency healthcare services and law enforcement services were exempted from this announcement. Nevertheless, just after the announcement of lockdown, more than 11 million people left Dhaka to be in their home districts and commenced the risk of COVID-19 infection to the entire 64 districts in Bangladesh. On 15 May 2020, with 20,065 confirmed cases, 298 deaths ( Figure 1 ) Bangladesh is within the top 30 affected country. With only 41 labs located in the urban areas, it is not easy to be tested for COVID-19 and often the tests are done after the patients had expired. Moreover, at present Bangladesh has 1,169 ICU beds, totalling to 0.72 beds/100,000 citizens. Of these 432 beds are in government hospitals and 737 in private hospitals. Likewise, there are only 550 ventilators in the country (IEDCR, 2020) .",

Moreover, many emergency service providers such as frontline doctors, healthcare staffs, caregivers, police and armed forces, bankers and government authority were infected, isolated and even died. Private practitioners, clinics, and hospitals in suburban and rural areas were shut down due to the fear of infection. Moreover, the healthcare workers who have treated the patients and infected have been socially hatred and stigmatized. Besides, the deceased was even denied burial in the local graveyards which are basic human rights and, in most cases, handled by the government authority (TBS, 2020a) . The price hike of the daily necessities was observed due to low supply and shopkeepers and suppliers stopped working fearing infection.

Besides, Bangladesh hosts the largest refugee camps in Cox's Bazar which is also about to embrace the COVID-19 pandemic, where, it will have catastrophic outcomes (Hopman et al., 2020) . Despite the precautions taken by the government and other international aid bodies, on 14 May 2020, the Coronavirus cases were detected in Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps (TBS, 2020b) . Moreover, miscommunication among the government ministries, policymakers, advisers and the country's apex trade organizations such as Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) and the trade organization of the ready-made garment (RMG) manufacturers Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) led industry workers to return to the industrial districts due to the message of reopening at least two times first on 4 th April and later on 11 th April. To save their jobs, thousands of RMG workers travelled back to Dhaka and its surrounding districts on foot, in a truck, or covered vans without social distancing while ensuring further transmission. The district of Dhaka and its Upazilas Savar and Ashulia, Gazipur, Narayanganj, and Chittagong remained the highest infected clusters of COVID-19 infection (IEDCR, 2020) . The latest extension period declared by the GoB is until 30 May 2020. Yet the RMG factories and other industrial operations resumed from 26 April 2020. Moreover, as the biggest Muslim festival Eid-Ul-Fitr approaches, mass people are gathering in the shopping centres despite the risk of spreading human transmission. It is utterly depicting the scenario of overlooking risks of the pandemic by unaware citizens while social anxiety and fear of the pandemic in concerned citizens. Both should be immediately dealt with by the Government along with the alliance groups with proper risk communication.",

PCA is one of the population data reduction techniques that indicate each potentiality of variables and their significance level in a huge sample size. Before conducting the PCA, Kaiser-Maier -Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's sphericity tests were applied to confirm the necessity of this analysis. The results of the KMO >0.5 (the KMO value was 0.903 in this research) and the significance of Bartlett's sphericity test at p < 0.01 verified our datasets to be fitted for the PCA (Islam et al., 2020) . The number of factors chosen was based on the Kaiser's normalization principle, where the only factors with eigenvalues>1.0 were regarded. PCA results were used to find how many components are to be retained as well as how many items in each of those components are to be retained. Furthermore, the test of association between each principal component and the demographic characteristic of the respondents were performed to see how people of different demographic status to perceive socioeconomic crisis and mental stress using the one-way ANOVA and ttest.

All the elements of the statement (HSB) showed moderate loading score revealing the fragility of the healthcare system of Bangladesh in dealing with COVID-19 pandemic, for instance very low ratio of intensive care unit (ICU) beds to population, limited or centralized COVID-19 testing facilities along with bias in selecting the test candidates, low test rate, lack or a substandard quality of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the caregivers, lack of institutional isolation units, and very poor coordination in health management systems, etc. Afterwards, the PC2 (Second) elucidated 8.82% of the total variance, and it was moderately positive loaded with the socioeconomic issues (SEI), including the risk of poor people from urban areas forced to temporary migration while having no options for income along with the chance of inducing social conflicts due to this outbreak; restriction of basic supplies including foods; price hikes of commodities, losing jobs (SEI1-6: 0.576-0.734). However, weak but positively loaded socioeconomic issues such as shut down or lockdown or social distancing might have an economic and social impact in the future (GDI4; 0.362) along with the small formal and informal business will also be hampered.

However, the reported case numbers are given by the Bangladesh Government certainly underestimates the actual number of infected persons given the shortages or unavailability of test kits (Ebrahim et al., 2020) . The laboratory facilities for testing are only accessible in the urban areas and 33 testing laboratories are still a few numbers in a country of 165 million population. The fear of getting the virus-infected along with the administrative procedure of testing and reluctance of other private clinics and hospitals to admit patients is a sign of weak governance in the healthcare of Bangladesh. In this scenario, other critical care patients are denied admittances, negligence, and often left to die without treatments. After the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Bangladesh, at least 929 \u00fe death cases having COVID-19 like symptoms were reported in the different national daily newspapers until 10 May 2020, which is 3 times higher than the reported deaths by the GoB. This indicates a serious level of community transmission is occurring in Bangladesh.",

In this scenario, it is imperative to deal with the peoples' fear and anxiety by the government. Proper information should be circulated to get the people out of confusion.

Yet weeks of being in isolation, quarantine, physical trauma creates further loneliness and anxiety and issues of a mental health crisis that have been mostly overlooked. At the individual level and the government level, proper risk communication is required. Special attention should be given to combat child and women abuse. Necessary action should be proposed for the post-recovery phase, suicide prevention, and mental health management (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Gunnell et al., 2020; Mamun et al., 2020) . Several cases of suicide were reported due to the fear and stress of COVID-19 infection symptoms, job-loss, sudden fall to extreme poverty, economic crisis, hunger, and unable to cope with social hatred.

The urban COVID-19 testing facilities, long serial to be tested, lowest facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients hampered the other critical patients to get healthcare services. It was a good decision by the government to recruit 6000 doctors and nurses to combat this pandemic. The government needs to take decisions to implement testing facilities for both public and private clinical laboratories all over Bangladesh. As with the COVID-19 outbreak, other critical care patients and infectious diseases such as dengue testing are being affected and patients are being deprived.

The recommendations collected in the perception study can be summarized as to increase COVID-test rate and medical facilities. The strengthening and decentralization of the COVID-19 medical facilities and treatment are especially important for all 64 districts as the disease spread to entire Bangladesh. Besides, proper risk assessment and dependable risk communications, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, take care of biomedical waste, ensure basic supports to the people who need, and good governance was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh.
