This manuscript aimed to extend the literature by exploring the feasibility of using Baidu search data to monitor and predict the cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea in mainland China. The data analysis method of this research has innovation, and the results have certain enlightenment for AIDS prevention and control. This is a well designed and carefully implemented study and the findings are of interest to related researchers or public health workers. A few major and minor concerns are listed below. 1. There are seasonal fluctuations in HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhea cases in Figure 1 . Please add the possible reasons in the discussion section.",

In addition, the reason why we did not update the data and the prediction is shown as follows:",

            "text": "Q1: The VAR model is suitable for the analysis of multivariate time series. \"Our results expanded the application range of VAR in epidemiology (VAR model is more widely used in economics)\". Is there a similar literature for applying VAR to the analysis of infectious diseases? How to verify the accuracy of applying this analysis method? A1: The vector autoregressive (VAR) model is one of the extensions of time series analysis. Time series analysis models have been broadly applied in the area of surveillance and prediction of infectious diseases. For example, generalized additive model (GAM) and time-series method were applied to analyze the association between hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in children aged <15 years and meteorological variables in Guangzhou from 2008 to 20111. In addition, multivariate infectious disease surveillance have also been used for various infectious diseases because it could be applicable by adding other variables into the model2 3. For VAR model in infectious diseases, it was mostly used in spatiotemporal distribution or test-incidence feedback4 5. Existing literature used time series analysis and multivariate models to explore the applicability of VAR model. We applied these models in our analyses and got good prediction result (the performance of prediction results was evaluated by metrics Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) etc.). A2 & A3: We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. The prediction was calculated using not only official data but search engine data. We found the algorithm of the Baidu search volume for specific keywords have experienced an update, rendering the search data in 2016-2017 to be different from those in 2018-2019. There is an improvement of the search engine statistics in Baidu, thus future research could be done to adjust or change models accordingly. In our future research we will try to add other search or browsing history from different social websites to the data set to make the prediction more valid and then complete our prediction method. Because of above reasons, we think it would be better to stick to data obtained in 2016-2017.",

It would be more precise to zoom into data at provincial or even lower levels. Albeit Baidu Index website at both national and provincial levels are accessible, the disease report system at provincial level is both untimely and inconsistent. In many provinces, only aggregated figures are reported on a yearly basis, monthly reports are not available. This makes it impossible for us to compare Baidu search data and disease report data reported at provincial level. This however points to the necessity of timely and consistent disease reporting system at provincial and lower levels. We added this sentence in the Discussion.",
