Studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 enters into human cells through human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as it's receptor which was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2), but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon (Zhang et al., 2020) . Besides the common symptoms included fever, fatigue, and dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms were also occurred in some patients with COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) , additionally, researchers had tested and isolated viable SARS-CoV-2 from stool (Holshue et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020; Pan et al., 2020) . Those demonstrated that digestive system is a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, previous clinical diagnosis and discharge criteria were mainly based on respiratory system (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020), and studies of the enteric involvement and viral excretion of SARS-CoV-2 in faces as well as the influences of gastrointestinal infected SARS-CoV-2 on the disease course were not available (Yeo et al., 2020) . Here, we reported 3 cases who were discharged meeting for all of the hospital discharge criteria (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020) were admitted again may due to the persistence of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
