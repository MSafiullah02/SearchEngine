In addition the particulates can act as vehicles for transport of noxious molecules deep into the lungs. There are few fire studies investigating irritants, and organo-irritants which have sub-lethal health effects. Little has been done to investigate fire generated particles, their morphology, size distribution and chemical composition as the particle size distribution is dependent not only on the material, but also on the temperature and fire conditions (such as residence time in the flame).",

A more detailed analysis of the literature values reveals that four data sets cover a range of 5\u2013521, and three 3600\u201328300 pg I-TEQ/g residue. The latter come from measurements on ash from three large-scale PVC fires, two in Germany (Lingen and Lengerich) and one in Canada (Boisbriand, Quebec).

The PCDD/F load in soot from PVC fires ranges between 35000 and 539000 ng I-TEQ/g soot (Carroll, 1996).
