In addition to causing upper respiratory disease, we found that HCoV-NL63 can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, febrile seizures, and high fever. The mean age \u202b\u05e2(\u202c standard deviation [SD]) of the infected children was 30.7 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 19.8 months (range, 6-57 months).

Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) have been recognized since the mid 1960s as causes of upper respiratory disease, including the common cold, and are group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses, respectively. In 2003, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Its formal taxonomic status within the coronaviridae is not yet established [1] . Recently, another group 1 human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was reported in The Netherlands [2, 3] . In one report, 8 adults and children infected with HCoV-NL63 virus were documented; 3 patients had lower respiratory tract infection, 2 had an unknown clinical presentation, and the others had upper respiratory tract infection. A second report documented the same coronavirus in an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia [3] . One hundred thirty-nine other children and adults with respiratory tract infections whom tested negative for known viral pathogens underwent screening, which revealed the virus in 4 more children. However, a systematic study of the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection or its clinical presentation is still lacking. Furthermore, there is little information about the seasonality and clinical role of coronaviruses (other than SARS-CoV) in tropical or subtropical climates.",

With use of the known admission ratio between the 2 hospitals that provide care for 90% of patients on Hong Kong Island, we estimated that 188 children aged \u04406 years were admitted because of HCoV-NL63 infection, leading to an annual hospitalization rate of 224 hospitalizations per 100,000 population aged \u04406 years.

            "text": "We have described the clinical spectrum of this newly discovered HCoV-NL63 in a cohort of hospitalized children. In addition to causing upper respiratory disease, we found that HCoV-NL63 infection can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, and febrile seizures. The peak age for hospitalization with HCoV-NL63 infection was 2-3 years, which is similar to that for HCoV-OC43 infection. In comparison, the mean ages (\u202b\u05e2\u202cSD) of children admitted to the hospital with influenza, hMPV infection, and RSV infection in the same cohort were , , and months, respectively 30.2 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 22.6 31.7 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 18. 7 19.5 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 17.2 [4] . In contrast to an earlier report, the majority of children with HCoV-NL63 infection in our study had no major underlying disorders [3] . A coinfecting pathogen was identified in 5 of the 15 children. The child with C. jejuni diarrhea also had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection that were not explained by the bacterial infection but were probably attributable to HCoV-NL63. In the other 4 children, the coinfecting pathogen could fully explain the clinical presentation, and it is difficult to comment on the contribution of HCoV-NL63. When age-matched children with influenza A or RSV infection and HCoV-NL63 infection were compared, children with HCoV-NL63 infection had a shorter duration of fever than did those with influenza A, and they were less likely to have lower respiratory tract involvement than were those with RSV infection. The duration of hospitalization seemed to be equivalent for all 3 infections. Rapid virological diagnosis of RSV infection and influenza were available to clinicians, but diag- nosis of HCoV-NL63 infection was retrospective. Availability of rapid diagnosis has been shown to result in shorter hospital stay [7] . The HCoV-NL63 load in the nasopharynx is high during the first 1-2 days of symptoms and decreases in the next few days (figure 2). No correlation with disease severity was observed. These viral load data derived from cross-sectional data for a small cohort of patients and need to be further confirmed with sequential specimens. This pattern, with peak viral load around the onset of disease, is similar to that seen for influenza but different from that observed for SARS [16, 17] . The quantitative RT-PCR missed 1 of the patients with HCoV-NL63, suggesting that further optimization of the primer and probe sequence is required.",

Multiple pathogens in the respiratory tract of patients with respiratory disease are being increasingly recognized [13] .

It was previously shown that human coronavirus was detectable by PCR in 0.4% of patients without symptoms of respiratory tract infection and that HCoV RNA could be detected by real-time RT-PCR up to 14 days after infection [12] . In patients with coinfection, the apparent association between influenza virus A with HCoV-NL63 and parainfluenza virus type 1 with HCoV-OC43 is likely due to the coincidence of the seasonality of these viruses.",
