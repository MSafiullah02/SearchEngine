Several bacterial and viral agents are involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, most frequently in combination with other bacteria like Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, or viruses such as Swine Influenza Virus (SIV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine Circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) and Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV) are the most important micro-organisms responsible for lung diseases (Sorensen et al., 2006). Together they are involved in the Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC).",

Indeed, the infection pressure had to be at a very low level throughout the pigs\u2019 lifetime in order to reduce disease severity. Particular attention to critical transmission points is required to reduce pathogen transmission between animals. For many of the micro-organisms involved in respiratory diseases vertical transmission, relying on sow to piglet contamination, is suspected to occur in endemically infected herds during the suckling phase (Clark et al., 1991, Amass et al., 1996, Vigre et al., 2002, Zimmerman et al., 2006). Sows can thus serve as a reservoir for the continuous circulation of infectious pathogens especially in farrow-to-finish systems, where both populations, (i.e., the breeding herd and the growing-finishing pigs), are reared on the same site (Calsamiglia and Pijoan, 2000, Sorensen et al., 2006). Reducing the infection pressure in the sow herd may help to decrease spreading in the offspring. However, at present, little is known about the shedding and infection dynamics of respiratory pathogens, especially bacteria, in sow populations. Such information would be helpful to (i) properly design epidemiological studies for assessing/understanding infection dynamics within a herd and detecting the risk factors of respiratory diseases, (ii) provide accurate information for modeling studies, i.e. parameterization and validation of epidemiological models, and (iii) implement adequate control strategies. The aim of the present study was therefore to describe the carrying and infection patterns of batches of sows to various respiratory pathogens during gestation and lactation in herds differently affected by respiratory disorders.",

The farms were included on the basis of the veterinarian's knowledge of the farm and the results of an initial screening of 12 herds. Five herds were selected for different patterns regarding their respiratory health status in growing-finishing pigs and to tally with the most common herd health patterns, housing and herd management practices encountered in the field at that time. They were also selected for convenience as the farmer had to agree with our protocol. The screening visit took place 2\u20133 months before the present longitudinal field study was started. Clinical signs of respiratory disorders in the farrowing, post-weaning and finishing sections were recorded. Nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were obtained from 30 pigs: 10 in the post-weaning section, 10 at the beginning and 10 at the end of the finishing phase. Lungs from at least 30 of the sampled finishing pigs were collected at the slaughterhouse. Macroscopic lung lesions of pneumonia were scored (Madec and Kobisch, 1982) and samples of lung lesions were taken. Swabs and lung samples were examined by PCR in our laboratory to detect M. hyopneumoniae, P. multocida, A. pleuropneumoniae, H. parasuis and S. suis. All sera were analysed for the detection of antibodies to PRRSV and SIV (H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2).",

The lowest level of lung lesions in the five herds, was recorded in herd A. Herds B and C were endemically infected by PRRSV and differed in lung lesion severity, the finishing pigs in farm C being more affected by pneumonia. The last 2 farms (herds D and E) were the most severely affected by lung lesions as pneumonia and pleuritis were detected in more than 90% and 25% of the pigs, respectively. The finishing pigs were PRRSV and SIV positive, whereas the pigs from herd D tested positive for H1N1 antibodies, the growing pigs from farm E had antibodies against both SIV subtypes (H1N1 and H1N2).",

After checking for pregnancy, the sows in each herd were housed in a gestation room and were then moved to farrowing rooms about 1 week before the expected farrowing time.

During the gestation and lactation periods, the sows were housed in closed facilities with mechanical ventilation and slatted floor. The sows in the selected herds were not vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae during the study. Whether the sows were vaccinated earlier in life in the multiplier herd was unknown. The sows in herd C were vaccinated against A. pleuropneumoniae. The breeding sows in herd B were vaccinated against PRRSV and SIV. The same commercial SIV vaccine (antigens A/New Jersey/8/76 (H1N1) and A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2)) had previously been used in herd A but no SIV vaccine was used in this herd during the study.

However, they were selected to tally with the different respiratory patterns in growing-finishing pigs most frequently encountered by veterinarians in the field. Their inclusion was based on the results of a preliminary screening step involving 12 herds which were clinically examined and tested for the different agents under investigation. Hence, they were supposed to represent the different categories of herds identified in this screening step as suffering from different levels of severity and complexity of respiratory diseases. As all sows from a batch, selected at random, were included in the study, the cohorts should be appropriate representatives of the herds under study and thereby provide a valid picture of the infection patterns and even their variability between herds. However, one limitation of the study relies on the kind of production system sampled which may not be representative of farming types in use in all other pig producing countries.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive description of the microbial flora of the airways of naturally infected sows has been obtained under field conditions. We showed that the upper part of the airways of clinically healthy sows harboured a variety of respiratory pathogens such as S. suis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida and H. parasuis. This is in agreement with results of previous studies indicating that these bacteria are common inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic pigs raised under commercial conditions (Dritz et al., 1996, Baele et al., 2001, MacInnes et al., 2008). Even if for H. parasuis, A.pleuropneumoniae, S.suis and P. multocida only a limited number of serotypes are known to be highly pathogenic, PCR assays detecting species of pathogens were used as general descriptors of the infectious status towards the main bacteria species involved in respiratory diseases. An overall low pathogen load in a herd being recommended, the aim was to assess, at the pathogen species level, whether different infection pressure may be identified and were related to the overall respiratory health status of the farm. The results of our study in sows indicated that whatever the pathogen, its prevalence varied between farms and over time within herds. As only a small percentage of sows (<10%) was consistently detected positive to a given pathogen at all 8 sampling times, it can be hypothesized that the pathogen might transiently be present in small quantities, i.e., under the detection threshold of the PCR assay in the upper respiratory tract of the sows, and that shedding was intermittent in most of the animals. While S. suis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida and H. parasuis were the most frequent pathogens identified in the upper part of the airways of the sows, these pathogens were seldom detected in lung tissues of slaughtered pigs during the recruitment step. M. hyopneumoniae was indeed the only pathogen detected at slaughter from lungs of finishing pigs in all five herds. Even if the slaughtered sampled pigs were not the offspring of the sows followed in the present study, we can assume that other factors than the bacterial carrier state of the upper part of the respiratory tract of the sows may influence the infectious status of the lung in growing-finishing pigs.",

            "text": "\nM. hyopneumoniae plays a central role in PRDC and is widespread in pig herds (Thacker, 2006). Interestingly, even if the M. hyopneumoniae genome was detected in four out of the five selected herds, the micro-organism was relatively seldom identified at the sow level. The detection threshold of the simple PCR was estimated to be 10\u2013100-fold higher than that of nested-PCR (Marois et al., 2007). Therefore, this could have limited our capacity to detect sows carrying low numbers of M. hyopneumoniae (<1000 mycoplasma). The true prevalence of positive animals may in turn have been underestimated. On the other hand, when studying infection dynamics, the bacterial load carried by the animals is more important than a positive shedding status. Further studies using quantitative tests are needed to improve our knowledge on the course of M. hyopneumoniae infection under field conditions. Although M. hyopneumoniae DNA was not consistently detected, antibodies against the micro-organism were recovered in sows from all herds. Positive reactions in serum from sows may reflect previous exposure to M. hyopneumoniae, as vaccination was not carried out in the investigated herds. Interestingly, in the herd that showed the lowest number of seropositive sows, M. hyopneumoniae carriage was not detected at any sampling time. It can be speculated that M. hyopneumoniae infection dynamics within the sow population remained limited in this farm. The fact that M. hyopneumoniae was detected in the upper respiratory tract of seropositive sows, indicated, as already reported (Sibila et al., 2007), that circulating antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae did not prevent colonization of the airways. M. hyopneumoniae DNA was detected in sows from the first until the tenth parity suggesting that even the oldest sows may carry the organism and have the potential to spread the bacteria to susceptible animals, especially their offspring. In previous studies, relationships between sow parity and M. hyopneumoniae infection were inconsistent (Calsamiglia and Pijoan, 2000, Ruiz et al., 2003, grosse Beilage et al., 2009). Our study, being primarily descriptive, may lack sufficient power to find any significant association. Thus, further research seems to be required to conclude about the influence of sow age on M. hyopneumoniae infection, but, due to the expected low prevalence of carrier sows, altogether, these results emphasize the need to sample a large number of sows of different parity groups when assessing M. hyopneumoniae infection dynamics.",

These findings indicate that seroconversion is more likely to occur during the first two reproduction cycles and suggest that young sows are exposed to the micro-organism following their introduction in the breeding herd. Antibodies to the two considered serotypes were found in all herds. While the high seropositivity levels observed in herd C could be related to the vaccination, the antibodies detected in the four non-vaccinated herds indicated that sows were naturally infected. This also suggested that the infection is widespread among clinically healthy sow herds as reported for A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 (Levonen et al., 1994). It should be noted that the infection pressure differed between farms, as revealed by the varying levels of seroprevalence between herds.",

This is in line with a cross-sectional study showing that M. hyopneumoniae seropositivity in sows is influenced by various management factors (grosse Beilage et al., 2009). According to the results of the present study, the carrier state or serological status of the sows did not seem to be affected by whether they were in gestation or lactation. A decrease in the level of M. hyopneumoniae serum antibodies during the last month of pregnancy to the farrowing day was previously described (Wallgren et al., 1998). Since the last sampling time during pregnancy was performed 4 weeks before farrowing, our sampling scheme may have limited the ability to detect such a reduction. Whatever the micro-organism, a specific physiological stage with a maximum prevalence of carrier sows was not identified. Therefore, sampling sows at different gestation and lactation stages should be recommended, especially in cross-sectional studies looking for prevalence. On the other hand, the carrying patterns of the same batches of sows, especially for H. parasuis and S. suis, were different from the first to the second reproduction cycle suggesting a time effect on the level of carriage for a given batch. This tended to indicate that a batch effect is important to take into account in epidemiological studies as well as in diagnostic.",

            "text": "The seroprevalence of PCV-2 infection was high in the four herds we tested, hence confirming the widespread occurrence of PCV-2 in French sow herds as described earlier (Rose et al., 2003). Serological investigations also showed that SIV antibodies were highly prevalent in the sows which is consistent with the fact that viruses of H1N1 and H1N2 European subtypes are widespread in pig populations in France (Kuntz-Simon and Madec, 2009). HI tests revealed infections with H1N1 and/or H1N2 viruses, while H3N2 antibodies could only be detected in vaccinated sows or as a result of cross-reactions in the HI test as already reported (Van Reeth et al., 2006). The infection pattern of the sow batches towards PRRSV differed between the five herds in which the growing pigs were experiencing different levels of severity of respiratory disorders. While in herd A, being the less affected by respiratory diseases, PRRSV infection was not detected in the sows during the study, an increase in the frequency of PRRSV-seropositive sows was found in the herd the most severely affected by lung diseases in finishing pigs (herd E). This increase in seropositivity frequency indicated that PRRSV was actively circulating in the sow herd. A higher and stable frequency of PRRSV infection was recovered in the second herd with growing pigs severely affected by respiratory diseases. Conversely a lower and decreasing rate of infected sows was described in herd C, suggesting that the virus was no longer actively spreading in the sow population. In the latter herd, the growing-finishing pigs which were tested remained sero-negative throughout the course of the study (data not shown). In herd B, despite the use of a commercial inactivated vaccine against PRRSV, from 50% to 64% of the sows tested positive by serology. Under experimental and field conditions, some variations in seropositivity rates following vaccination with a killed vaccine have been described (Reynaud et al., 1999). In the same line, Papatsiros et al. (2006) found that the humoral response of sows following two vaccinations was short, lasting 40 days after the booster vaccination. In the present study, the antibodies detected 72 days after the vaccination were probably related to active infection. In addition, the PRRSV antibodies detected in growing pigs confirmed that this herd was not virus-free.",
