Following ligand binding and activation, oligomerisation of ErbB family members occurs [8]. ErbB signalling is then induced through phosphorylation of intracellular domains, resulting in the activation of several major intracellular signalling pathways, including mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u0138B), phosphoinositide 3 (Pi3) kinase, and janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways. ErbB-associated signalling pathways govern a wide variety of outcomes, including cell survival, proliferation, cell death/apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion, differentiation, and migration/invasion.",

In this context, ErbB expression on epithelial cells, the primary point of pathogen contact, plays a crucial role. As membrane receptors, ErbB functionality and localisation make them well positioned to provide a direct point of contact and entry into host cells. Not only are ErbB family members regularly endocytosed during their normal life cycle, but pathogen\u2013ErbB ligation 9, 10 and ErbB receptor signalling cascades 11, 12, 13, 14 can contribute to cellular entry of a diverse range of microbes. Pathogen-mediated hijacking of ErbB signalling pathways also results in prolonged host cell survival 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 as well as altered immune responses 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, which may, in turn, enhance pathogen persistence. Crucially, however, their role as growth factor receptors may be required by intracellular organisms, dependent on host cell machinery for self-propagation, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) 15, 27, 28, 29, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) [30], and human papilloma viruses (HPV) [31]. These pathogens are able to regulate transition through host cell cycle checkpoints, and indeed their association with ErbB receptors is linked to cellular transformation and oncogenesis. A direct correlation, however, between regulation of the cell cycle and oncogenesis, has not been shown.",

More recently, it has been shown that all three viruses are able to utilise EGFR (ErbB1) for host cell entry. While RSV 32, 33 and coronaviruses [34] induce EGFR-dependent macropinocytosis, a nonselective mechanism of internalising large bodies of extracellular material, IAV induces lipid-raft clustering on surface membranes, resulting in EGFR activation and internalisation of both virus and EGFR [35]. Interestingly, lipid rafts are also important for IAV viral budding and exit from host cells 36, 37, 38, 39. Newly synthesised structural IAV proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), can assemble at the cytoplasmic leaflet of lipid rafts 40, 41, providing a platform for nascent viral proteins to cluster at, form progeny virus, and from which to bud [42]. Given that EGFR localises at lipid rafts [43], a potential role for EGFR during viral exit may also exist (see Outstanding Questions). Additionally, the intestinal bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni\n[44] also requires lipid-raft clustering and activation of raft-associated proteins, integrin-\u03b21, EGFR, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) for induction of filopodia formation and bacterial invasion.",

The bacterial species Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is able to activate EGFR and induce expression of Claudin-2, a channel-forming tight-junction protein [49] which results in gut epithelium invasion [50]. Claudin-2 activation during infection is dependent on EGFR phosphorylation, as evidenced by a reduction in bacterial load following siRNA-mediated EGFR downregulation [50]. An alternative mechanism targeting junction proteins for cell entry is utilised by Staphylococcus aureus. Cleavage of occludin and E-cadherin, following EGFR activation, facilitates transmigration of S. aureus through cell\u2013cell junctions, and inhibition of EGFR activity prevents S. aureus migration through an epithelial monolayer [13]. Additionally, Neisseria gonorrhoeae induces an EGFR-dependent mechanism of \u03b2-catenin redistribution from apical junctions to the cytoplasm, resulting in weakened apical junctions and gonococcal transmigration across the epithelium [51].",

The bacterium Neisseria meningitidis also induces recruitment and aggregation of ErbB2, but not other ErbB family members, on endothelial cell membranes, directly beneath sites of bacterial colony formation. Subsequent activation of ErbB2 and downstream Src-dependent signalling led to internalisation of N. meningitidis and invasion of target cells [2].

            "text": "Another pathogen-mediated mechanism that promotes host cell entry may involve increased numbers of ErbB receptors at the cell surface. ErbB receptors spend the majority of their life span at the surface of cell membranes but continually undergo internalisation as part of normal processing. The fate of internalised receptors has important consequences for the cell. Potential receptor outcomes, following endocytosis, include recycling back to the surface (associated with proliferation), transport to other cellular compartments such as multivesicular bodies, the nucleus, or mitochondria (related to homeostasis), or being targeted for degradation (thought to promote cell death) 58, 59, 60. Pathogens appear to target these trafficking pathways for their own benefit. For example, HCV induces the upregulation of host-derived Netrin-1, which suppresses EGFR recycling, resulting in enhanced levels of surface EGFR, EGFR activation, and subsequent viral endocytosis [27], which occurs via virus-induced EGFR and host-derived CD81 protein binding [28]. Additionally, the ErbB ligand neuregulin-1 has been implicated in enhancing EGFR and ErbB2 surface expression during HCV infection [29]. N. gonorrhoeae-induced upregulation of several ErbB ligands was also found to coincide with translocation of both EGFR and ErbB2 receptors to apical surfaces, following infection. This disruption of normal receptor distribution within polarised epithelial cells led to enhanced bacterial invasion, and upregulation of EGFR-ligand mRNA was also observed [61]. Conversely, however, Escherichia coli-mediated disruption of endosome recycling leads to reduced surface EGFR, transferrin, and \u03b21-integrin expression [62]. Additional examples of EGFR-dependent mechanisms of host cell entry include Chlamydia pneumoniae Pmp21-mediated recruitment of EGFR [10], and EGFR-dependent formation of HPV type 16 (HPV16), Annexin A2 and S100A10 heterotetramers to facilitate HPV16 infection [31]. Interestingly, malignant tissue from patients with HPV-associated cancers often poorly express EGFR 63, 64. Further understanding of the connection between HPV and EGFR is required to fully appreciate this relationship.",

ErbB receptors are potent mediators of cellular growth and survival, and unsurprisingly they have become a commonly exploited target for this purpose also. The association between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and EGFR has been well studied. HCMV employs multiple mechanisms of modulating EGFR signalling for its own propagative benefit, including rapid induction of protein kinase B (PKB, alias Akt) activation, a protein kinase downstream of Pi3K with important roles in cell cycle regulation. Cojohari et al. showed that the use of MK-2206, a highly selective Akt inhibitor, during HCMV infection results in decreased viability of infected monocytes [11]. While uninfected cells utilise the primary isoform of Pi3K (P110\u03b4) for Akt signalling, a switch occurs in HCMV-infected cells to allow use of the less dominant P110\u03b2 isoform, resulting in prolonged cell survival past the 48 h cell-fate check point. While cell viability was dependent on P110\u03b4 activity in uninfected cells, inhibition of this predominant isoform did not cause apoptosis in HCMV-infected cells, which instead succumbed to cell death following P110\u03b2 inhibition [11]. Furthermore, evidence of EGFR-associated promotion of antiapoptotic proteins, myeloid leukemia sequence (Mcl-1), and heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) [12], as well as modulation of negative regulators of cell survival, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) [11] has also been shown. In summary, HCMV appears able to activate EGFR signalling, utilise alternative signalling molecules in this pathway, and manipulate EGFR to selectively prevent cell apoptosis for its own propagative benefit.",

Surface EGFR is upregulated on HBV-infected intrahepatic regulatory T cells (Treg), which enhances their immunosuppressive capacity [68]. HBV-infected mice exhibited increased numbers of Treg cells that expressed immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-\u03b2, in addition to an enhanced ability to prevent CD8+ T cell proliferation, a requirement for HBV clearance [68]. HCMV-induced latency is another interesting tactic providing immune evasion and is also governed by EGFR activity. During infection, the ability to induce latency-associated UL138, while suppressing IE1/IE2 lytic genes, was shown to be EGFR dependent, by the use of EGFR-specific inhibitors [69]. Additionally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can utilise EGFR-induced p38/MAPK signalling pathways within macrophages to prevent proper antimicrobial macrophage responses, resulting in enhanced murine infection [70]. However, in contrast to these pathogen-driven functions of EGFR that contribute to infection, some EGFR-induced host protective functions have also been observed. One study highlights the requirement of EGFR in macrophage activation and function against H. pylori, where EGFR-deficient macrophages exhibited impaired T helper (Th)1 and Th17 adaptive responses, resulting in suppressed H. pylori-induced chronic inflammation and disease progression in mice [71]. Additionally, EGFR-dependent S. aureus-induced IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 [23], as well as E. coli-\n[24] and virus-induced 72, 73, 74 IL- 8, may be examples of host-beneficial EGFR-dependent responses induced by pathogens.",

This virus is also thought to enhance ErbB2 mRNA stability through the HBV-encoded X-protein (HBx), which is itself strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), resulting in enhanced HCC cell migration [90]. Likewise, HCV infection results in enhanced surface EGFR expression 29, 61, EGFR activation, and consequent viral entry [28], whilst patients exhibiting certain EGFR polymorphisms spontaneously clear HCV infection [91]. HCV-induced AREG overexpression in human hepatoma cells contributes to prolonged infected-cell survival, cirrhosis, and HCC progression [15]. Furthermore, EGFR, which can also be cleaved from apoptotic cells to shut down signalling [92], is found in significantly higher concentrations in HCC patient plasma, in the presence of HCV and HBV infection [93]. Whether this reflects host attempts to curtail aberrant cell proliferation, or is merely a by-product of virus-induced apoptosis, remains unclear. So consistent is the increase in soluble EGFR during virus-induced HCC that it may serve as a marker for such disease [93].",

Interestingly, in this case, EGFR expression is commonly low 63, 64 and has been an area of detailed investigation. One explanation for the existence of \u2018HPV-positive EGFR-negative\u2019 malignancies could lie in the functional redundancy between ErbB receptors as well as an ability of family members to regulate expression of each other. Indeed, several studies have highlighted an overexpression of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors, or even ErbB3 dependency [94], in HPV-positive cancers 95, 96, 97, whilst Stindt et al. showed that HCV induced downregulation of ErbB3 and enhanced EGFR and ErbB2 expression on hepatocytes [29]. These results were reproducible following suppression of ErbB3 with siRNAs and suggests that ErbB3 can function to impact on the expression of EGFR and ErbB2 [29]. However, the presence of \u2018HPV-positive EGFR-positive\u2019 malignancies has also been observed 98, 99. Together, these examples highlight an association between HPV-induced cancer and ErbB receptors, though the full extent of receptor contribution to such disease remains incompletely understood.",

The ability of H. pylori to dephosphorylate EGFR is particularly interesting.

Coupled with their ability to induce hyperproliferation, it would be interesting to investigate the role of host cell turnover in ErbB-dependent pathogen survival. Several viruses (HBV, HCV, EBV, and HPV among others) are known to require host machinery for protein synthesis and subsequent viral replication; these host translational apparatus can be found in greater abundance at specific points during the host cell cycle [105]. As such, subversion of the cell cycle is a common theme where both cycle arrest and induction may occur [106]; however, the effect of either on associated disease remains unclear. Indeed, not all viruses possessing the ability to regulate the cell cycle, such as IAV and SARS viruses, are particularly associated with oncogenesis. Further investigation into the precise requirements of oncogenic pathogens, leading to host cell survival and replication, and the role of ErbB receptors in this context, may provide valuable insights to developing more effective cancer therapies.",

Their cellular localisation, regulated mode of internalised recycling, and functional capacity make the ErbB family an excellent target for pathogens that require access into host cells in order to self-replicate. Several ErbB-dependent pathogens show the capacity to regulate the cell cycle to access host machinery; however, the direct effects of this on prolonging host cell survival or enhancing proliferation remain undefined.

To date, research in this context has focused predominantly on viral pathogens, with much less detail known regarding bacterial and fungal infections. Investigations are also skewed toward the more prominent EGFR, and interest in this host receptor may be warranted as it is the only ErbB member to undergo ligand-induced internalisation, greatly enhancing its appeal for pathogen exploitation. However, given the functional redundancy of ErbB receptors, and their potential to regulate expression of each other [29], it would be remiss not to fully investigate the role of all family members. With drug resistance increasing in a plethora of pathogens, there is an immediate and critical need for the development of innovative therapies that target novel factors. As such, ErbB receptors and associated signalling pathways may possess potential value as novel therapeutic targets during pathogenic infection. This notion is supported by a recent study which validates the efficacy of the specific EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib, in conjunction with a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sunitinib, against a range of evolutionarily distinct viral pathogens [107]. Both drugs have FDA approval as immunomodulatory cancer therapies and would also be exciting prospects as novel antimicrobial drugs. However, toxicity concerns that include adverse skin conditions, diarrhoea, and heart failure, may warrant limitation of their use to treatment of more serious infections.",

Does EGFR, therefore, play a role during budding of nascent viral progeny?Both enhanced cell turnover and barrier integrity have been shown to be protective against pathogen invasion, factors that ErbB receptors are directly capable of inducing. Is there potential to enhance this protective role of ErbB receptors as a preventative measure against infection?How efficacious would current ErbB-targeted therapies be against pathogen infection in humans? Toxicity and resistance against such drugs has been observed in cancer patients.
