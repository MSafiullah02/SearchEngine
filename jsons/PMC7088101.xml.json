            "text": "Health anxiety refers to inappropriate or excessive preoccupation and concerns about one\u2019s health status relative to his or her actual state of health (Abramowitz and Braddock 2010). People with health anxiety also engage in a number of behaviors that function to reduce their distress, such as frequently visiting doctors, excessively researching diseases and their symptoms on the internet, or seeking reassurance from loved ones. Although such health-related \u201csafety behaviors\u201d may reduce associated distress in the short-term (Abramowitz and Moore 2007), research suggests that these behaviors maintain anxiety in the long-term (see Helbig-Lang and Petermann 2010). Although a diagnostic entity in itself (i.e., Illness Anxiety Disorder [IAD]), health anxiety may be present in a number of psychological disorders, including obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), somatic symptom disorders, and other anxiety disorders (APA 2013). Clinically severe health anxiety and associated safety behaviors may result in significant distress and functional impairment (APA 2013). Researchers and clinicians have long observed increases in health anxiety referrals during times of mass media coverage of serious diseases, such as during the Ebola outbreak in late 2014.",

Although experimental vaccines and treatments are in development, there is no FDA-approved medicine available for Ebola to date. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention have chronicled 35 Ebola virus outbreaks between 1976 and 2014, varying in severity (CDC 2014). The 2014 multinational outbreak in West Africa (i.e., Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) has been deemed the largest outbreak, with at least 21,000 affected human cases accounting for nearly 9000 deaths worldwide (CDC 2014). Between September 30, 2014, and October 23, 2014, the CDC documented two imported cases, including one death, and two locally acquired cases in the U.S. (Dallas, TX, and New York, NY). Accordingly, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center, deployed public health experts to the affected regions, and issued an advisory against nonessential travel to West Africa (i.e., Level 3 travel notice).",

Specifically, constant communication regarding the disease may have promoted desirable health behaviors (e.g., hand-washing) and simultaneously (or alternatively) incited panic akin to that observed during the SARS, avian flu, and Swine flu epidemics over the last decade (Sandman 2009; Van den Bulck and Custers 2009). For example, during the height of the Ebola concern, certain U.S. shops, school districts, and state governments enacted substantial \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d against a seemingly remote danger (Fox 2014). In Maine, one healthcare worker contested forced quarantine in her own home for 21 days after returning from Sierra Leone despite showing no symptoms and twice testing negative for Ebola. As of October 14, 2014, approximately two-thirds of U.S. residents surveyed reported fears about an Ebola outbreak in the U.S (Dennis and Craighill 2014).",

Other groups in the popular press (e.g., Robbins 2014) even coined the term \u201cFearbola\u201d to refer to the U.S. public\u2019s exaggerated collective response to the very low threat of a domestic Ebola outbreak. To this end, the American Psychological Association (APA 2014) disseminated tips for \u201cmanaging your fear about Ebola\u201d (i.e., keep things in perspective, get the facts); yet it is unclear if\u2014or how\u2014such counsel was effective.",

Elevated levels of health anxiety may also be accompanied by safety behaviors performed to minimize the possibility or severity of illness (e.g., avoidance, excessive washing, or overutilization of medical resources), which may compound distress and functional impairment (e.g., Olatunji et al. 2011). Accordingly, we designed the present study during the height of U.S. concerns about Ebola to better understand the psychological factors associated with Fearbola and engagement in Ebola-related safety behaviors. Informed by the limited body of recent research on anxiety among students in response to pandemic illnesses such as SARS (e.g., Wong et al. 2007), avian flu (e.g., Lau et al. 2008), and H1N1 (e.g., Wheaton et al. 2012), we considered a variety of constructs that might predict the fear of Ebola, as we describe next.",

Not only can general distress be associated with poor physical health (Scott et al. 2007; Niles et al. 2014), but both anxiety and depression involve negative interpretive biases that are often involved in anxiety related to health and illness (e.g., catastrophizing; Reif et al. 1998). Second, because Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids, it is possible that those holding dysfunctional beliefs about contamination are more vulnerable to excessive fear of Ebola. In other words, Fearbola may reflect an overestimation of the likelihood and severity of contamination during a global outbreak. Third, disgust sensitivity, or one\u2019s propensity to experience disgust across multiple domains, has also been identified as a key feature of contamination fear (Cisler et al. 2010; Olatunji and Sawchuk 2005). Thus, we also considered heightened disgust responding as a potentially important process that may be related not only to contamination aversion broadly, but also to Ebola fear specifically.",

Indeed, Olatunji et al. (2007a) found that body vigilance was strongly correlated with health anxiety symptoms in both clinical and nonclinical adult samples. Relatedly, anxiety sensitivity, the tendency to misconstrue benign anxious arousal sensations as dangerous (Taylor et al. 2007), may also predict Ebola fear and safety behavior performance.

Because cognitive models of pathological anxiety emphasize the therapeutic effects of corrective information (e.g., Abramowitz et al. 2011; Clark 1986), one might predict that those possessing greater understanding about Ebola would report less anxious responding to the possibility of a domestic outbreak.",

We hypothesized that in our unselected U.S. university student sample, greater anxiety sensitivity, body vigilance, disgust sensitivity, contamination concerns, and general psychological distress would predict greater Ebola fear and engagement in safety behaviors (e.g., avoiding airports) with the intention of preventing infection. We also hypothesized that having more factual knowledge about the Ebola virus and the details of the 2014 outbreak would predict less Ebola-related fear and safety behavior use. To address the study\u2019s aim, we developed brief measures of Ebola related fear and safety behavior use, which both demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. Consistent with our predictions, Ebola fear and safety behaviors were correlated with general distress, contamination cognitions, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety sensitivity related to physical concerns. Contrary to our predictions, fear of the disease was not associated with knowledge about the Ebola virus and the 2014 outbreak. When considered simultaneously in our regression model, the tendency to overestimate the severity of contamination emerged as the only significant predictors of both Ebola fear and associated safety behaviors. Physical anxiety sensitivity concerns significantly predicted Ebola fear but only marginally predicted Ebola safety behaviors, and disgust sensitivity only significantly predicted safety behavior use. Body vigilance only marginally significantly predicted engagement in Ebola related safety behaviors. Overall, our findings provided partial support for our hypotheses.",

Given our access to a large unselected population of young adults exposed to media coverage of the Ebola outbreak, we were well positioned to identify the predictors of Ebola-related fear and safety behaviors. Clarifying the factors that might contribute to such anxiety is valuable in understanding how the public responds to large-scale illness threats more generally and identifying individuals who might be vulnerable to maladaptive responses (i.e., health anxiety). It may also be of service in developing prevention programs and clinical intervention strategies should the threat of another global panic surface. That is, our study\u2019s findings suggest that contamination concerns and physical concerns related to anxiety sensitivity may be especially important in the experience of Ebola-related anxiety and safety behaviors, regardless of accurate factual understanding of the disease.",

Although our findings are cross-sectional, one way anxiety sensitivity might contribute to fearful responding to the Ebola virus is through the misperception of benign (and universal) body sensations as dangerous. Such a perception might especially lead to fear considering that many body sensations associated with anxiety mirror the symptoms of Ebola (e.g., nausea). It is also not surprising that concerns regarding the severity of contamination significantly predicted Ebola fear and safety behavior use. Ebola is indeed a severe illness with extremely unpleasant symptoms (e.g., fever and hemorrhaging), but it is possible that the frequent, widespread media coverage in the U.S. led residents to overestimate the severity of the disease. Similar possibilities were discussed in a study of undergraduates\u2019 fearful responding to the heavily publicized H1N1 pandemic in 2009\u20132010 (Wheaton et al. 2012). Findings from our study cannot, however, provide causal evidence for the role of increased media coverage on increased Ebola fear and safety behavior use.",

An alternative explanation for our finding is that some participants coped with their fear of Ebola by seeking out knowledge and information about the disease (akin to reassurance-seeking in health anxiety), thus washing out the hypothesized effect. Therefore, findings from our study may inform cognitive interventions, as providing accurate information regarding the nature and severity of focal disease outbreaks may be insufficient to adequately challenge dysfunctional health- and illness-related beliefs. Because our study included a nonclinical sample, however, future research utilizing healthy and health anxious individuals would help determine whether providing accurate information about the risk of disease outbreaks in the U.S. is sufficient to mitigate such illness fears in clinical practice.",

These authors reported that contamination cognitions (both likelihood and severity overestimates), disgust sensitivity, and health anxiety significantly predicted H1N1 fear, but that physical concern-related anxiety sensitivity, body vigilance, and general distress did not. Therefore, our findings are somewhat consistent with Wheaton and colleagues. One possible explanation for the discrepant findings relates to disgust-related elements (e.g., sympathetic magic) differentially associated with the H1N1 and Ebola viruses. The peak of the 2014 Fearbola panic saw only four total U.S. human cases (only two of which were contracted locally), yet 2009\u20132010 witnessed approximately 60.8 million H1N1 U.S. cases (Shrestha et al. 2011). Therefore, Ebola may have been perceived as more distant and remote a threat than the H1N1 virus was in 2009\u20132010. Another consideration is that H1N1 is a more communicable virus than Ebola, which would make disgust a more powerful predictor of anxious responding to H1N1 than Ebola. In contrast, mechanisms such as the laws of contagion, similarity, or sympathetic magic (see Cisler et al. 2009) may have been more relevant for U.S. residents reporting greater Ebola fear. Unfortunately, this study did not assess participants\u2019 perceptions of contagion related to the Ebola outbreak specifically, so such explanations are purely speculative. Future research investigating the degree to which certain outbreaks are specifically perceived as disgusting, dangerous, and controllable are warranted.",

A second limitation is that participants in our study were recruited from a single southeastern university. Individuals living in less populated areas (e.g., Wyoming) or in states with confirmed Ebola cases (e.g., Texas) may have experienced different levels of concern.

It is possible that individuals with greater contamination concerns are more prone to respond fearfully to Ebola, that those with higher Ebola fear were more likely to develop contamination concerns, or that one or more other factors (e.g., observational learning, informational transmission) contributed to both high contamination concerns and Ebola fear. Future longitudinal studies are necessary to determine which constructs prospectively predict the onset of health anxiety in response to the threat of a serious disease. Similarly, the possibility that safety behaviors generate or exacerbate Ebola concerns is especially worthy of consideration in light of research showing that deliberately engaging in health-related safety behaviors (e.g., avoiding public contaminants) causes individuals to become more concerned with the risks of contamination (Deacon and Maack 2008; Olatunji et al. 2011).
