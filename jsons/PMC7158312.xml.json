            "text": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrates antigens in tissue sections by incubating the sections with specific antibodies and demonstrating the immunologic reaction with a histochemical (enzyme-substrate) reaction to produce a colored (visible) reaction (Ramos-Vara, 2005). Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be used. In general, polyclonal antibodies are usually raised in rabbits and have higher affinity but lower specificity than monoclonal antibodies. Cross-reactivity (defined as recognition of unrelated antigens) is more common with polyclonal antibodies. Key in the use of polyclonal antibodies in diagnostic IHC/ICC is their degree of purification (examples of commercially available antibodies include whole serum antibodies, antibodies purified by precipitation of immunoglobulins, and immunoglobulins purified by affinity chromatography). Monoclonal antibodies, produced in mice using the hybridoma technology, recognize a single epitope (a 4-8 amino acid chain in a protein) and therefore are highly specific and have constant characteristics among different batches of antibody. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being used in human diagnostic IHC, but despite their reported advantages over mouse monoclonal antibodies (e.g., higher affinity, no need for antigen retrieval, use on mouse tissues), some of them neither react on animal tissues nor perform better than mouse monoclonal antibodies (Reid et al., 2007; Vilches-Moure and Ramos-Vara, 2005). Selection of a particular antibody will be determined by published information or the experience of other laboratories. There are no guarantees that an antibody that recognizes an antigen in one species will do so in another species; only testing will determine if this is the case. Needless to say, the large number of species from which samples can be obtained is one of the biggest challenges that a veterinary pathologist must face in immunodiagnostics.",

            "text": "The universal fixative for histopathology and diagnostic IHC is buffered formalin. Attempts to replace formalin fixative in diagnostic IHC have failed, although for specific situations the use of nonformaldehyde fixatives, particularly glyoxal-based, has been reported (Yaziji and Barry, 2006). Fixation is necessary for preservation of cellular components, to prevent autolysis and displacement of cell constituents, to stabilize cellular materials (antigens), and to facilitate conventional staining and immunostaining (Ramos-Vara, 2005). The use of formalin is not without problems. First, the quality of formalin solutions varies widely in regard to concentration of formaldehyde, pH, and presence of preservatives. Second, formalin fixation, by producing methylene bridges between amino groups and other functional groups, alters the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins and forms cross-links between soluble tissues and proteins. These chemical reactions may modify the targeted epitope. Amino acids that are especially sensitive to formalin fixation include lysine, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, and serine. Despite the fact that formalin fixation may impair immunohistochemical detection, good fixation is paramount to detect antigens with IHC. Underfixation is as bad as or worse than overfixation, and is a fairly common problem due to reduced turnaround times in diagnostic laboratories. With the advent of heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER), overfixation or variable fixation time among samples is less critical in the detection antigens targeted in human diagnostic IHC (Webster et al., 2009). The same will probably be true with common antigens demonstrated in animal samples. Autolysis is a common problem in diagnostic pathology. Studies addressing the effects of autolysis in IHC have shown that most antigens are still detectable despite decomposition; however, caution in the interpretation of autolyzed material is necessary due to the loss of detection of some antigens (Maleszewski et al., 2007). Necrotic tissue tends to produce more background than normal tissue; however, IHC of necrotic tissue can provide valuable information when no other tissue is available, particularly for cytokeratins and CD45. Decalcification of formalin-fixed tissues generally does not reduce the immunoreactivity of most antigens, particularly when using weak acids; some loss of reactivity is apparent when using strong acids for decalcification, but it does not affect all antigens.",

Antigens have been successfully detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues stored for several decades (Litlekalsoy et al., 2007). Autolyzed samples or those with biopsy artifacts should be avoided. For IHC and ICC, samples are mounted onto silanized slides, poly-L-lysine-coated slides, or charged slides to allow a strong bond between the slide and the tissue section. Pooling of reagents under the tissue section or tissue loss can occur when using noncharged slides or slides without special coatings. Complete deparaffination is critical to achieve optimal immunostaining. Deparaffination is somewhat cumbersome and there are commercial products to perform deparaffination and antigen retrieval simultaneously although results may not be completely satisfactory. A simple approach to deparaffination and antigen retrieval with heat has recently been published (Boenisch, 2007).",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, formalin fixation modifies the tertiary structure of proteins, often rendering antigens undetectable by specific antibodies. A factor in the binding of antibodies to antigens is their conformational fit, which may be modified during fixation. Antigen retrieval (AR) is intended to reverse the changes produced during fixation. In addition to conformational changes in the structure of proteins, fixation produces major changes in the electrostatic charge of proteins (antigens), which is critical for the initial attraction between antigens and antibodies. Therefore, recovery of the electrostatic charges lost during formalin fixation has been proposed as another mechanism of antigen retrieval for many (but not all) proteins. In other words, it appears that more than one mechanism may be involved in the lack of recognition of antigens by antibodies after fixation in cross-linking fixatives. The two more common AR procedures include proteolytic enzymes (e.g., pronase, trypsin, proteinase K) and immersion of slides in buffer at high temperature. Each antibody may react differently to antigen retrieval and therefore it is necessary to test several methods when optimizing the IHC procedure although some HIER procedures appear to produce optimal results in a wide variety of antibodies. With the variety of AR methods available, standardization of IHC methods among laboratories and comparison of results is very challenging at best.",

Endogenous peroxidase (for immunoperoxidase procedures) is common in numerous tissues although formalin fixation destroys most of it. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase (for alkaline\nphosphatase detection methods) is blocked in procedures using this enzyme. Mammalian tissues have two alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes; the nonintestinal form is easily blocked with levamisole; the intestinal isoform unfortunately requires acetic acid to be blocked, a chemical that can damage some antigens. Numerous tissues have endogenous avidin-biotin activity that must be blocked before adding biotinylated reagents in avidin-biotin detection systems. Nonspecific binding of immunoglobulins to tissue is blocked by incubating tissue sections with bovine serum albumin or serum from the same species as the secondary reagent before the incubation with the primary antibody. There are commercially available reagents to block endogenous activities and nonspecific immunoglobulin binding.",

            "text": "The immunohistochemical reaction can be divided into an immunologic (antigen-antibody) reaction followed by its demonstration with a histochemical (colored) reaction. The sensitivity of the immunohistochemical reaction is mostly the result of the detection method used (Ramos-Vara, 2005); progress in this regard has been dramatic in the last decade. Two main enzymes are used in IHC: peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. Peroxidase is probably the enzyme most commonly used, but in some occasions, particularly with heavily pigmented samples or samples rich in endogenous peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase is an excellent alternative. Current IHC methods can be divided into avidin-biotin or non\u2013avidin-biotin systems. After incubation with the primary antibody, a secondary antibody specific for the primary antibody (secondary reagent) is added. For avidin-biotin systems the secondary reagent is biotinylated. For avidin-biotin methods, a tertiary reagent labeled with avidin molecules and an enzyme (peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) is needed. The most common non\u2013avidin-biotin method is based on polymer technology. The polymers contain many molecules of secondary antibodies and enzyme. Polymer methods are usually two-step methods, whereas avidin-biotin methods are usually three-step methods. Polymer-based methods have fewer steps, do not have endogenous avidin-biotin background problems, and are usually more sensitive, but are beyond the scope of this review (Vosse et al., 2007). Detection of multiple antigens in the same tissue section is also possible. Issues to keep in mind in double or multiple immunostaining is the compatibility of AR among antigens to be detected, the type of primary antibodies (polyclonal or monoclonal), cellular localization of antigens, and the color of chromogens used.",

Optimization (standardization) of a new antibody/test is the process of serially testing and modifying components of the procedure (e.g., fixation, antigen retrieval, antibody dilution, detection system, incubation time, etc.) with the aim of producing a consistent, high-quality assay. The reader is advised to standardize every antibody used in his/her laboratory despite the existence of published protocols, to ensure optimal results. Standardization includes adequate tissue fixation. Tissues should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 8 hours. Every new antibody is tested following a standard protocol that includes three pretreatments: no antigen retrieval, AR with a proteolytic enzyme (e.g., proteinase K), and HIER (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0); and four, two-fold dilutions of the primary antibody (Ramos-Vara and Beissenherz, 2000). With this standard protocol, the total of slides initially processed for each antibody is 15, including a negative reagent control for each pretreatment. The positive control section used in standardization (and later in a diagnostic setting) is one in which the antigen in question has been detected with a different method (e.g., virus isolation) and its cellular location is known. A negative control section (containing cells known by independent methods to lack the antigen in question) also should be included. Usually, the same tissue block used for the positive control can be used for the negative control.",

Antibodies used as tumor markers need to be tested against tumors that may be difficult to distinguish from the one in question (tumors with similar phenotype, e.g., round cell tumors) with routine stains and tumors present in the same location/organ (Ramos-Vara et al., 2007).

Cytospins and cell smears are used when the sample volume is small. The advantage of cytospins is better preservation of cytomorphology. However, ICC on cytospins, cell smears, and liquid-based monolayer preparations (ThinPrep) tends to produce more background staining (Barr and Wu, 2006). Cell blocks of FFPE thrombin clots are the method of choice when there are abundant cells (e.g., effusions). The advantage of cell blocks is the similarity of processing to surgical pathology specimens (and therefore comparable results), the possibility of preparing multiple sections of the same block (e.g., for testing multiple markers), and ease of storage. Cell blocks may present some disadvantages such as loss of cytomorphology and loss of antigenicity due to formaldehyde fixation (Brown, 2001). Cell blocks are preferred for nuclear antigens (e.g., Ki-67, p53, PCNA), whereas air-dried cytospins are preferred for the detection of surface antigens (e.g., leukocytic antigens). ThinPreps are less suitable than cell blocks for detection of nuclear antigens (Gong et al., 2003).",

The ICC staining can be done with or without previous destaining (with acid alcohol) of the routine stain (Abendroth and Dabbs, 1995; Barr and Wu, 2006; Miller and Kubier, 2002). However, there are some technical drawbacks to using previously stained slides: loss of cells from the slide, cell disruption (affecting mostly ICC of membranous and cytoplasmic markers), and signal reduction for some markers (e.g., S100) due to repeated passage of the sample through graded alcohols. In cases in which only a slide is available and the area containing cells is large, multiple markers can be tested simultaneously. Alternatively, the sample can be divided following tissue-transfer techniques (Sherman et al., 1994).",

This issue is very different from diagnostic IHC, in which a universal fixative, 10% buffered formaldehyde is used in most instances. Here we are giving general rules, but each laboratory should standardize and validate their protocols to obtain consistent results. Fixation is necessary to preserve cell integrity during multistep immunostaining procedures. Fixation should be performed immediately before immunostaining; theoretically, the type of fixative is selected on an antibodyby-antibody basis. In general, for lymphoid and melanoma markers, samples should be fixed for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature in acetone; for epithelial markers, 5 minutes at room temperature in alcohol (95% ethanol or a 1:1 mixture of methanol and 100% ethanol); for nuclear antigens, 3.7% buffered formalin for 15 minutes (Fetsch and Abati, 2004). Some authors favor formal saline as a universal fixative suitable for most antigens (Leong et al., 1999). S100 protein, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, and hormone receptors are not well demonstrated in ethanol-fixed samples due to cytoplasmic antigen leakage (Dabbs, 2002).",

The peroxidase block is necessary when using immunoperoxidase techniques; the usual method is with 3% H202 in deionized water. The peroxidase blocking step can be omitted in acetone-fixed specimens. Antigen retrieval is necessary in numerous occasions. Unfortunately, there is no rule to determine a priori whether antigen retrieval is needed or which method is optimal.

In very few cases is IHC considered a standalone technique in human or veterinary pathology. Specific knowledge of the right staining pattern of a given marker is extremely important to determine whether the staining is significant or not. Interpretation of ICC is more challenging than that of IHC because of the difficulty in obtaining positive and negative control samples treated in a similar way to the test sample and the additional difficulty of distinguishing normal from neoplastic cells. As stressed in the upcoming section on immunohistochemical diagnosis of metastatic tumors, there are very few, if any, antibodies that are truly specific for a single cell type. The interpretation of an IHC reaction is based on the expected \u201cantibody personality profile\u201d (see below) and the infidelity of tumor-specific markers (e.g., reactivity in T-cells with B-cell markers) (Yaziji and Barry, 2006). Simultaneous presence of an antigen in more than one cellular compartment is possible in neoplastic cells, but usually results from diffusion of proteins due to cellular damage during processing. Detection of an antigen in an unusual location should be interpreted with caution and indicated in the immunohistochemical report. Generally speaking, antibodies used in IHC can be used in ICC. In addition, some antibodies that are nonreactive in surgical biopsy specimens are suitable for cytologic preparations.",

Some markers are expected to be present in most cells in a tumor (e.g., cytokeratins in a carcinoma), whereas the detection of other markers (e.g., uroplakin III in transitional cell carcinoma) in only a small group of cells is considered a positive result. Perhaps, as recommended recently in human pathology (Goldstein et al., 2007), a statement in the IHC report indicating the intensity of the staining and the percentage of positive tumor cells would be more informative than merely a positive or negative result as provided in a recent veterinary study (H\u00f6inghaus et al., 2008). The lack of expression of a particular antigen may be as significant as its presence in prognostication (e.g., absence of expression of progesterone receptor is linked to poor outcome in human breast cancer; lack of bcl-6 expression combined with MUM1 expression in cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma is linked to short survival) (Bardou et al., 2003; Sundram et al., 2005). In human pathology IHC antibodies are classified as Class I devices by the FDA, meaning that antibodies are considered special stains as adjuncts to conventional histopathologic diagnostic examination (Rhodes, 2005). In other words, with some exceptions, IHC is not a standalone technique and results must be interpreted by the pathologist in the context of the disease. Some IHC tests (e.g., assays for ER, PR, HER2/neu) are considered class II devices with potential predictive or prognostic value. Similarly in veterinary medicine, immunohistochemical results are part of the pathology report and need to be interpreted by the pathologist (Ramos-Vara et al., 2008).",

One of the main problems is the lack of standardization and quality control among laboratories, particularly in regard to antigen retrieval. This interlaboratory lack of reproducibility is significant when dealing with prognostic markers (Mengel et al., 2002). Interpretation of immunostaining is also subjective (wide range of interobserver interpretations) and a degree of knowledge of IHC and the antibodies used is required to interpret results correctly. What constitutes a positive result (percentage of positive cells needed, intensity of the reaction) is still controversial, but a critical issue for therapeutic decisions in oncology. Some tumors do not express specific markers beyond the generic ones, which makes testing with multiple markers expensive and unrewarding. Neoplastic cells up- and downregulate gene expression, resulting in the lack of expression of expected antigens or the expression of new antigens. All these issues are perhaps more serious in veterinary medicine, where the degree of sophistication and use of IHC techniques is not as advanced as in human pathology, and are exacerbated by interspecies differences in antigen expression and detection.",

            "text": "There are multiple causes of background staining. A common one is inadequate blocking of serum proteins. Blocking is usually done with normal serum or protein (Brown, 2001). Bovine serum albumin has been used extensively in the past as a blocking reagent of nonspecific reactions. However, there is recent evidence that adding albumin to antibody and diluent solutions increases the background of immunohistochemical reactions (Mittelbronn et al., 2006). Other causes of false-positive staining are necrotic tissue, crushed cells, improper fixation, incomplete blocking of endogenous peroxidase or endogenous biotin, and high concentration of the primary antibody (Dabbs, 2002). Samples that are too thick tend to trap reagents and produce background staining. Carcinoma cells in fluids often express vimentin and lose their immunoreactivity for cytokeratins; antigens shed into effusion fluid can be absorbed onto the surfaces of other cells present in the same fluid. Some antigens in cytologic samples such as factor VIII-rAg and immunoglobulins tend to diffuse into the surrounding tissue contributing to incorrect interpretation of immunostaining (Barr and Wu, 2006). To avoid overstaining due to the concentration of the primary antibody, retitration of primary antibodies on cytologic preparations is recommended. Other causes of background staining are included elsewhere (Ramos-Vara, 2005). When using detection kits that recognize primary antibodies made in goats, extensive background in both the positive and negative controls is observed if using tissue sections from the same or related species (ruminants) due to the presence of endogenous immunoglobulins recognized by the secondary antibody (anti\u2013goat IgG). A similar problem is observed with rabbit monoclonal antibodies tested on rabbit tissues or mouse monoclonal antibodies tested on mouse tissues. Special detection procedures are commercially available to avoid this background staining. Although not an example of nonspecific background staining, it is very important in immunocytochemistry to distinguish positive staining in normal or reactive cells from that of neoplastic cells. This distinction can be challenging when the number of reactive cells is higher than that of the neoplastic cells (e.g., T-cell\u2013rich B-cell lymphoma). Fig. 17-1\nand Fig. 17-2\nshow examples of background and nonspecific staining.",

For the negative reagent control, either an irrelevant antibody or nonimmune serum from the same species as the primary antibody (and ideally the same Ig isotype for monoclonal antibodies) replaces the primary antibody (Fetsch and Abati, 2004). The slide with the negative reagent control should be processed in an identical manner as the slide with the primary antibody. The negative control slide is used to assess nonspecific staining that is not the result of specific antigen-antibody binding (background staining).

            "text": "The goal of diagnostic IHC is to maximize sensitivity without compromising specificity of results. A typical approach is to cover the main tumor types with antibody panels that include cytokeratins (carcinoma), vimentin (sarcoma), S-100 (melanomas or peripheral nerve sheath tumors), and CD45 (leukocytic neoplasms). To achieve maximum sensitivity, the use of \u201credundant\u201d antibodies for a given antigen is recommended: in other words, the use of several antibodies that should label the same cell type. Table 17-2\nlists cell markers and their use in the immunochemical diagnosis of tumors, with emphasis on organ system. In human pathology, the following expanded panel has been proposed: Pan-cytokeratin (carcinomas), CD45 and CD43 (lymphomas), S-100 and Melan-A or gp 100 (melanomas), vimentin and collagen IV (sarcoma) (Yaziji and Barry, 2006). Some of these markers are not available or not reactive in animal tissues, so alternatives need to be found. Once other clinicopathologic data has been examined judicious use of antibodies is the best approach: it will reduce both the cost of testing and the need to explain unexpected reactions to the client. Once a particular tumor group has been identified (e.g., sarcoma), more specific markers to determine the type of tumor are used. This approach is based on\nalgorithms. Fig. 17-3\nshows a basic algorithm to characterize tumors frequently found in domestic species. This algorithmic approach is borrowed from the human experience; unfortunately many markers currently used in human pathology are not reactive in animal tissues or their reactivity is different (in other words, when dealing with IHC, not all animal species and antibodies are created equal). This problem is compounded because the extensive testing (validation) of antibodies used in human diagnostic IHC is almost nonexistent in veterinary medicine. The lack of predictive behavior (percentage of positive cases of a tumor with a particular antibody) is one of the most difficult barriers to overcome in veterinary diagnostic IHC. The use of a particular marker will be also determined by its availability in the laboratory. Many antibodies with diagnostic or prognostic significance in human pathology await validation in similar tumors of animals (Capurro et al., 2003). A similar algorithmic approach can be used in immunocytochemistry.",

They are separated by charge into acidic (type I) and basic (type II) keratins. Cytokeratins are paired together as acidic and basic types. Most low\u2013molecular weight keratins (e.g., CK 7, 8, 18, 20) are present in all epithelia except squamous epithelium, whereas high\u2013molecular weight keratins (e.g., CK 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10) are typically present in squamous epithelium. Almost all mesotheliomas and carcinomas, except squamous cell carcinomas, have CK 8 and 18. The coordinate expression of CK 7 and CK 20 is one criterion to classify carcinomas in human pathology. This approach has proven very useful in metastatic carcinomas of undetermined origin. There is only one paper published regarding domestic animals that examines a wide range of carcinomas in dogs and cats for expression of CK 7 and CK 20 (Espinosa de los Monteros et al., 1999). Results for CK 7 were similar to those in humans, but major differences were observed for CK 20 among both animal species. CK 5 is a useful marker of myoepithelial differentiation in glandular tumors as well as for squamous epithelium and mesothelial cells. Although cytokeratins are the typical marker of epithelial differentiation, they can be detected in mesenchymal tumors (melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, liposarcoma, meningioma, and angiosarcoma), although usually in only a few cells, as opposed to the diffuse and strong staining of carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas (Dabbs, 2006). Coexpression of intermediate filaments has been reported in certain human fetal and adult tissues.",

Most eventually will be relegated to use in combination with other antibodies (as part of a tumor panel). In this section are presented some markers that are useful in the characterization of specific animal tumors. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), a nuclear transcription factor, is frequently expressed in thyroid tumors (more common in follicular, but also present in medullary, tumors) and pulmonary tumors (Ramos-Vara et al., 2002a, 2005). Other tumors, including mesotheliomas, are usually negative. Hep Par 1 (hepatocyte paraffin 1) is consistently detected in hepatocytes and their tumors with no staining of biliary epithelium, which makes it a good choice to distinguish these tumors, particularly when used in conjunction with CK 7 (Ramos-Vara et al., 2001a). However, some intestinal, and probably pancreatic, tumors can be positive (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2002). Melan-A is one of the best specific and sensitive markers of melanomas in dogs (less sensitive in feline melanomas) and certainly more specific than other classic markers such as S100 and NSE (Ramos-Vara et al., 2000, 2002b). It should be noted that many steroidproducing tumors from the adrenal cortex, testis, and ovary show strong reactivity for Melan-A (Ramos-Vara et al., 2001b). Uroplakin III, a major component of the asymmetric unit of transitional epithelium, is expressed in most canine transitional cell carcinomas and, in conjunction with CK 7, the number of transitional cell carcinomas detected approaches 100% (Ramos-Vara et al., 2003). Uroplakin III has not been detected in nonurothelial normal or neoplastic tissues of dogs which makes this marker the exception to the rule (coexpression of the same marker in different cell types).",

However, attempts to use it in canine mesotheliomas with a variety of antibodies have been unrewarding. There is a report of calretinin staining in equine mesothelioma (Stoica et al., 2004). The differential diagnosis of mesothelioma and pulmonary carcinoma is challenging in human pathology and numerous antibodies have been tested. A recent study indicates that the combination of D2-40 and calretinin (both positive in mesothelioma and negative in lung carcinoma) and CEA and TTF-1 (both negative in mesothelioma and positive in pulmonary carcinoma) antibodies is an economic way to distinguish these two types of tumors (Mimura et al., 2007). Desmin is detected in reactive mesothelial cells but not in mesothelioma or carcinoma in cytologic preparations (Afify et al., 2002). As previously mentioned, TTF-1 is a specific and sensitive marker of canine pulmonary and thyroid carcinomas. The use of CEA on animal tumors is very limited. We are not aware of D2-40 staining of mesotheliomas in animal species. The use of both cytokeratins and vimentin (usually coexpressed in mesotheliomas) is probably the best approach to distinguish mesothelioma from pulmonary carcinoma in animals (Geninet et al., 2003; Morini et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2005; Vural et al., 2007).",

In mast cell tumors, there is good correlation between decreased survival time and Ki67 index and between the histochemical detection of nuclear organizing regions (AgNORs), which determine the rate of cellular proliferation (generation time) and decreased disease-free interval (Webster et al., 2007a). In a different study (Scase et al., 2006), both AgNORs and Ki67 scores were considered useful prognostic markers for canine mast cell tumors, with Ki67 score used to divide Patnaik grade 2 mast cell tumor into 2 groups showing markedly different actual survival times. PCNA score did not correlate with differences in survival times of several types of tumors (Roels et al., 1999; Scase et al., 2006; Webster et al., 2007a).

With each cell division, telomeres progressively shorten in all somatic cells until cells undergo replicative senescence or apoptosis. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that synthesizes telomere DNA. In normal cells telomerase is detected in male germ cells, activated lymphocytes, lens tissue, and stem cell populations but not in somatic cells. In human cancer, telomerase activity is detected in 85% to 90% of cases and in dogs more than 90% of tumors examined express telomerase activity (Kow et al., 2006). Telomerase expression in dogs is significantly associated with tumor proliferation (Ki67 labeling index) and/or tumor grade (Long et al., 2006). Immunohistochemical detection of telomerase could be useful as a prognostic marker and tool to determine the therapeutic approach to cancer (Argyle and Nasir, 2003).",

Glutaraldehyde has a slower diffusion rate than formaldehyde and very small samples (around 1 mm3) are required for optimal fixation. Formaldehyde is not an optimal fixative but in diagnostic pathology is the most commonly used primary fixative for EM, particularly when ultrastructural studies are not considered initially in the diagnostic workup. Due to the impurities of commercially available formaldehyde solutions (e.g., formic acid, methanol), ultrastructural preservation is compromised.

Semi-thin sections (0.5 to 1.0 \u03bcm) are first cut to localize the most appropriate portion of the sample to section at an approximate thickness of 60 to 90 nm (silver to straw-colored ultra-thin sections). Routine sections are usually stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (osmium fixative will also stain membranes and lipid vacuoles). FFPE tissues can be used when no other sample is available. Keep in mind that the degree of preservation of organelles and membranes in FFPE samples may be severely compromised.",

After examination of FFPE tissues under the light microscope, differential diagnoses are made and additional ancillary techniques (e.g., EM, IHC) are requested for further characterization of that lesion. After examining a lesion by light microscopy, the pathologist will determine which features to seek at the ultrastructural level. During the ultrastructural examination, a good observer may find additional, unexpected features that prompt reconsideration of the original diagnosis. Formalin fixation or delayed fixation will probably create artifacts that may render the sample unsuitable for thorough ultrastructural evaluation but still adequate to detect specific features (e.g., viral particles, parasites,\ninclusions, crystals). Buffered formaldehyde (approximately pH 7.4) will reduce the loss of cellular components and tissue shrinkage.",

An alternative method is to prepare the cells by differential density centrifugation through a solution such as Histopaque. Neutrophils, red blood cells, and platelets will pass through the solution, whereas mononuclear cells will remain on top of the Histopaque layer.

Figure 17-12\ndemonstrates a typical scatter plot from canine peripheral blood, where each dot represents an individual cell placed relative to the amount of forward and side scatter recorded as it passes in front of the laser. Typical scatter properties allow the identification of lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil populations.",

Different fluorochromes have distinct peak emission wavelengths so antibodies conjugated to two different fluorochromes can be used simultaneously in one staining reaction. The amount of fluorescent signal detected is proportional to the number of fluorochrome molecules on the cell. The data can then be displayed as a single parameter in the form of a histogram, or two parameters can be displayed simultaneously as a dot plot (Fig. 17-13\n).

A number of studies have described the immunophenotypic markers of canine lymphoma and leukemia (Appelbaum et al., 1984; Day, 1995; Caniatti et al., 1996; Ruslander et al., 1997; Grindem et al., 1998; McDonough and Moore, 2000; Modiano et al., 1998; Ponce et al., 2003). Distinguishing a reactive from a neoplastic process is often the first task faced by the clinician. Finding of a phenotypically homogeneous population of lymphocytes suggests a neoplastic, rather than a reactive, process. For example, canine chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most commonly involves an expansion of CD8+ T cells, and less frequently B cells (Vernau and Moore, 1999; Workman and Vernau, 2003). CD8 T cells usually comprise 25% to 35% of canine peripheral blood, and B cells usually comprise 5% to 20% (Byrne et al., 2000; Greeley et al., 2001). Leukemia would be the primary differential diagnosis in a dog with persistent lymphocytosis when a majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes are CD8+ T or B cells, although no criteria have been established in veterinary medicine for making this distinction. A rare exception to such an interpretation in dogs would be lymphocytosis in Ehrlichia canis infection, which can be associated with the selective expansion of CD8+ T cells (Heeb et al., 2003; McDonough and Moore, 2000; Weiser et al., 1991). To our knowledge, there are no such examples in cats. Studies of the predictive value of an expanded lymphocyte population and the absolute lymphocyte counts that can be used to define leukemia would be important and clinically useful, but at present no such reports are available in the veterinary literature.",

Human T-cell leukemias are characterized by their tendency to lose expression of normal T-cell antigens, or to express aberrant combinations of antigens (Jennings and Foon, 1997). For example in one study of 87 human malignant T-cell disorders, complete loss of any T-cell antigen (CD2, CD5, CD7) or the panleukocyte antigen CD45 was diagnostic for malignancy (Gorczyca et al., 2002). In order to detect aberrant antigen expression it is useful to examine a large panel of antigens using multicolor fluorescence protocols. In our experience, loss of the panleukocyte marker CD45 is the most common form of aberrant antigen expression in T-cell leukemia while smaller numbers of cases have been documented that have lost expression of CD4 and CD8 (Vernau and Moore, 1999). Despite the utility in helping to diagnose T-cell leukemia, decreased expression of CD45 does not appear to be associated with prognosis (Williams et al., 2008).",

The use of anti\u2013canine CD34, a marker generally found on precursor lymphocytes, is useful in objectively identifying cases of acute leukemia. CD34 is most likely expressed on both ALL and AML (Villiers et al., 2006; Workman and Vernau, 2003), but there are presently no published studies examining the distribution of CD34 on different leukemic subtypes. In addition, because the traditional classification scheme for acute leukemia has relied on cellular morphology alone, the correlation between blast morphology and CD34 expression has not been established. Despite this fact, recent work has documented a significantly shortened survival time in dogs with increased numbers of circulating CD34+ cells (Williams et al., 2008).",

Leukemias staining with either of these markers can generally be classified as lymphoid. Cells staining with surface markers such as CD14 or CD11b are classified as myeloid. Intracellular staining with an antibody to myeloperoxidase or using the antibody MAC387 may provide further confirmation of the myeloid origin of these cells. There is an excellent study correlating AML subclassification (AML-M1, M4 and M5) with immunophenotype using a variety of markers (Villiers et al., 2006), but similar studies are not available for ALL.",

A proportion of the lymphocytes associated with the neoplastic epithelial tissue in a thymoma will coexpress CD4 and CD8 so that this phenotype, together with the small size of the cells, is diagnostic for thymoma (Fig. 17-14\n).

Approximately 75% of stage III lymphomas, which have no visually detectable circulating neoplastic cells, will have a PARR+ result in the peripheral blood (Lana et al., 2006b). The presence of these cells does not appear to correlate with a worse outcome; however, clinical staging remains the most useful predictor of prognosis. It may be possible to use PARR to monitor the progression of disease following chemotherapy and to predict relapse before it is clinically evident, but this application has not yet been explored.",

Most translocations found in human leukemia and lymphoma involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus. For example, the t(11;14) translocation juxtaposes the locus encoding cyclin D1 on chromosome 11 to an immunoglobulin-enhancer sequence on chromosome 14. This translocation, which results in the overexpression of cyclin D1, is found in virtually all cases of mantle cell lymphoma (Campo, 2003). Detection of the translocation by PCR or the overexpressed protein by immunohistochemistry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma in histologically ambiguous cases. Recently, a consortium of European researchers found that the combined use of clonality determination through antigen receptor rearrangements together with detection of this and other translocations by PCR resulted in detection of a clonal population in 95% of cases of confirmed lymphoid malignancies (van Krieken et al., 2003).",

Flow cytometry is the first test of choice for animals with peripheral lymphocytosis. In cases of cytologically or histologically confirmed lymphoma, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or immunocytochemistry are the best methods for immunophenotyping. Table 17-8\nlists common diagnostic dilemmas involving lymphoproliferative disorders, and the type of test that is most useful in each. Note that while this list applies to both dogs and cats, both flow cytometry and PARR are less rewarding in cats.
