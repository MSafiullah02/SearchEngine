            "text": "An unusually high number of cases of jaundice in young calves were reported in Southern Germany beginning in the fall of 2010. The results of an epidemiological survey carried out in Bavaria between November 2010 and July 2011, followed by a preliminary feeding trial carried out by the authors suggested a causal involvement of a commercially available dietary supplement used for prevention and treatment of diarrhoea in neonatal calves (Metzner et al., 2012). Detailed information about the epidemiological investigations and the preliminary feeding trial with this dietary supplement can be found elsewhere (Metzner et al., 2012). The investigation of acetonitrile\u2013water extracts of each component of the dietary supplemental feed in the MTT assay according to Reubel et al. (1989) [reduction in a yellow tetrazolium salt to violet formazan by cellular enzymes using human epidermoid cancer cells (Hep2\u2010cells)] revealed a cytotoxic effect of two of the 12 tested components (chestnut extract and glycerol monolaurate). Chestnut extract is obtained by water extraction of the chestnut wood (Castanea sativa) and is mainly composed of tannins, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and mineral salt (Graziani and Tosi, 2006). Tannins can be classified into two categories: hydrolysable and non\u2010hydrolysable (condensed) tannins. Both hydrolysable and condensed tannins exist in sweet chestnut wood, but hydrolysable tannins predominate (Anad\u00f3n et al., 2005).",

Interest in feed ingredients containing tannins has increased as their potential use as growth promoters in animal feed has been described in the literature (Hooge et al., 2012). The antimicrobial properties (Graziani and Tosi, 2006) of tannins and the resultant beneficial effects on body weight gain and reduction in mortality are documented (Hooge et al., 2012). Furthermore, tannins are suggested to be good candidates in the control of gastrointestinal parasites in ruminants (Min et al., 2005) and broiler chicks (McCann et al., 2006) as well as certain avian virus infections such as avian reovirus and avian metapneumovirus (Lupini et al., 2009).",

Recent in vitro studies documented the effect of glycerol monolaurate as an effective growth inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus (Kelsey et al., 2006), Candida species (Strandberg et al., 2010) and virulence factor producing Bacillus anthracis (Vetter and Schlievert, 2005).",

Although total serum bilirubin is not considered to be a sensitive indicator of hepatic dysfunction (Pratt and Kaplan, 2007), elevation of total bilirubin concentration is frequently documented in cases of hepatocellular necrosis in cattle (Raposo et al., 1998). Hence, the significant increase in concentration of total bilirubin in group C on day 9 and 10 indicates a liver dysfunction which supports the evidence that chestnut extract alone or in combination might be the causal factor.",

According to Steinhardt et al. (1995), elevation of L\u2010lactate concentration can be a consequence of an increase in production due to hypoxia and enhanced sympathetic activity due to stress around the time of birth. More importantly, elevation of concentration of L\u2010lactate is known to be a result of inhibition of mitochondrial function by certain drugs which impair both beta\u2010oxidation and the respiratory chain enzymes, and is a hallmark of mitochondrial impairment (Scatena et al., 2007) and hepatocellular dysfunction (Pratt and Kaplan, 2007). Elevation of the concentration of L\u2010lactate is also seen in severely dehydrated calves suffering from acute diarrhoea (Tennant et al., 1968). We cannot determine with certainty whether the increase in concentration of L\u2010lactate in treatment groups C and CG was a direct consequence of hepatic failure or if it was due to dehydration as a consequence of acute diarrhoea. However, as only three calves were severely dehydrated, it seems likely that the substantial increase in the concentration of L\u2010lactate in group C and CG was a direct consequence of hepatocellular dysfunction. Neonatal diarrhoea can lead to abnormal posture and behaviour in calves. In several cases, this may be due to septicaemia (Fecteau et al., 1997) or D\u2010lactataemia (Lorenz, 2004). However, similar abnormalities have also been documented in cases of hepatic encephalopathy (Buczinski et al., 2007). As all calves in this study suffered from diarrhoea to some extent, the cause for abnormal posture and behaviour scores cannot be determined. Abnormalities in the central nervous system of calves can be due to hypoglycaemia (Leifer and Peterson, 1984) as well as hepatic failure among other reasons (Mayhew, 2009). Several authors highlight the effect of low ambient temperature and the resulting hypothermia on glucose level in newborn calves (Diesch et al., 2004). Temperatures during the study period ranged from \u22128.5 to +18.8 \u00b0C, with lower temperatures possibly resulting in an excessive cold stress and a more rapid depletion of carbohydrate reserves (Todd et al., 2000). Hypoglycaemia as depicted in Fig. 6 in calves of groups C and CG may be due to loss of hepatic mass and a consecutive failure of gluconeogenesis (Scatena et al., 2007).",

Toxic effects associated with tannins differ between species. Monogastric animals predominantly develop liver and gastrointestinal lesions (Zhu et al., 1992), whereas in ruminants, renal damage predominates (Zhu et al., 1995). This was not confirmed in this study.

Yet the findings of this study are strikingly similar to descriptions and findings of those calves described in the preceding epidemiological investigation of commercial dairy farms carried out between November 2010 and July 2011. Several causes have to be discussed when trying to explain this difference between both feeding trials. In contrast to the preliminary feeding trial under hospital conditions, the present study was carried out under field conditions on a commercial dairy farm. We assume that differences due to location, management and pathogen load played a substantial role and were more consistent with conditions described in the preliminary study. Despite the fact that each calf received chestnut extract according to its individual body weight, some calves recovered from clinical disease or were only affected subclinically (showing abnormal blood parameters only), while others died or had to be euthanised. Concurrent infections (diarrhoea, pneumonia, etc.) could have influenced the development and severity of the disease caused by the treatment. It has to be mentioned that none of the experimental calves in the preliminary feeding trial suffered from diarrhoea, whereas in the present study, all experimental calves did so to some extent during the 13 days of the trial. Apart from this, temperatures during the preliminary trial (May and June, 2011) were between +0.4 and +33.9 \u00b0C and therefore decreased the risk of hypothermia in newborns. The striking difference concerning the clinical outcome in the present study in comparison with the experimental calves in the preliminary feeding trial as reported by Metzner et al. (2012) may also have been due to the fact that feeding a single component (chestnut extract) or two components (chestnut extract plus glycerol monolaurate) had a stronger impact on liver function compared with feeding the complete feed supplement. We cannot rule out that the hepatotoxic effect of chestnut extract as shown in this study was attenuated by one or more components in the commercial product. The question whether there is a potentiation in the hepatotoxic effect when both components are fed at the same time could not fully resolved due to an unexpectedly high mortality leading to a premature termination of enrolment according to the stopping guidelines defined prior to the start of the study.",
