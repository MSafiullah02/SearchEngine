            "text": "Glycosides represent an important class of biologically active organic compounds. The sugar moieties of the glycosides are crucial for their activities [1], [2] and pharmacokinetic parameters [3]. Recent developments in glycobiology implicated that glycosyl-conjugates played essential roles in biological recognition and cell signalling [4], [5]. Glycosides were involved in pathology of human severe diseases, such as cancer. Based on these findings, it is possible to develop new, more active or more effective glycodrugs [6]. With the increased understanding of drug metabolic processes, it has led to a growing appreciation of the role and significance of \u2018phase II\u2019 metabolites, glucuronides in particular. Glucuronides of xenobotics not only perform an important detoxification role, but also have significant biological activities. Therefore, glucuronylation of natural or synthetic compounds has been an attractive method for developing new active drugs [7]. A very illustrative recent example is the story of morphine-6-glucuronide [8], [9].",

It has been shown that GL induces various biological activities, such as an anti-inflammatory effect, and antiviral effects [10], anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013coV activity [11]. GA is metabolite of GL by removal of two molecules of glucuronic acid. Glycyrrhetic acid monoglucuronide (GAMG) is the intermediate metabolite between GL and GA. For having two molecules of glucuronic acid, the strong molecular polarity of hydrophilic GL is a hindrance of entering into hydrophobic cell membrane and then taking its effects. The obvious evidence is that there is no detectable level of GL in the patient blood after oral administration. Only GAMG and GA were detected in the patient blood [12]. Without glucuronic acid, hydrophobic GA had a too weak solubility in the blood because of a weak molecular polarity. With one molecule of glucuronic acid, GAMG had a suitable molecular polarity, and had many benefit properties compared to GL and GA. So GAMG exhibited the similar (or stronger) effects to (or than) glycyrrhizin and GA.",

The highest GL hydrolase activity was found to be at pH 6.0 using phosphate buffer (Fig. 1\n). These findings are in accordance with several earlier reports showing pH optima of 5\u20137 for partial purified \u03b2-glucuronidase from Bacteroides J-37 [19], Eubacterium sp. [20], Cryptococcus magnus MG-27+\n[17] and Streptococcus LJ-22 [16]. It also indicated that the GL hydrolase was very sensitive to pH and lost its activity entirely when pH is beyond 8.0. GL hydrolase had an optimum pH range of 5.8\u20136.2 at which their activity is maximal. This could be explained as follows. On one hand, amino acid side chains in the active site may act as weak acids and bases with critical functions that depend on their maintaining a certain state of ionization, and elsewhere in the protein, ionized side chains may play an essential role in the interactions that maintain protein structure. On the other hand, the substrate, GL is a weak tribasic acid and the variation of the degree of ionization of carboxyl group with pH affects it binding to enzyme molecule.",

The enzyme activity gradually declined at temperatures beyond 55 \u00b0C (Fig. 3\n). This occurs because as the temperature changes this supplies enough energy to break some of the intramolecular attractions between polar groups as well as the hydrophobic forces between non-polar groups within the protein structure. When these forces are disturbed and changed, this causes a change in the secondary and tertiary levels of protein structure, and the active site is altered in its conformation beyond its ability to accommodate the substrate molecules it was intended to catalyze. A optical temperature of 50 \u00b0C was recorded for a \u03b2-glucuronidase from Cryptococcus magnus MG-27+\n[17] and 45 \u00b0C for GL hydrolase derived from Aspergillus niger GRM3 [21], those were different in optical temperature with the crude enzyme reported in this work.",
