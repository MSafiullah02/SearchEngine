The standard curve was established by using multiple-proportion-diluted plasmids containing the entire hfgl2 gene. In THP-1 cells the value of relative mRNA expression of hfgl2 induced by N protein of SARS-CoV was 6.4, whereas it was 2.4 and 2.5 induced by M and S2 protein of SARS-CoV. In Vero cells, the value of relative mRNA expression of hfgl2 induced by N protein was 5.4, whereas it was both 2.1 induced by M and S2 protein of SARS-CoV. It was evident that SARS-CoV N protein significantly enhanced hfgl2 mRNA expression compared with untreated group, whereas M and S2 protein of SARS-CoV did not. To determine the expression of hfgl2 on the protein level in response to SARS-CoV proteins, western blotting analysis of hfgl2 was performed in THP-1 cells and Vero cells. It was shown that hfgl2 protein was enhanced distinctly by the stimulation of SARS-CoV N protein in THP-1 cells. No hfgl2 protein was detected in the cells transfected with pcDNA-M or pcDNA-S2 (Fig. 4).

            "text": "Our results confirmed that N protein of SARS-CoV activated hfgl2 expression both on the mRNA level and on the protein level. These findings were consistent with previous structural and functional analysis in response to N protein of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV N protein is a 46 kDa structural protein and was demonstrated to activate other host genes. N protein has also been reported to activate the activator protein 1 (AP1) signal transduction pathway and induce apoptosis in COS-1 cells in the absence of growth factors (33, 34). SARS-CoV N protein can also significantly activate NF-\u03baB only in Vero E6 cells, which are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, but not in Vero or HeLa cells (23). Yan et al. (24) investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in regulation of the pro-inflammatory factor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and demonstrated that N protein could regulate COX-2 gene expression. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein bound directly to a NF-kappaB-binding site and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-binding site. Protein mutation analysis revealed that a Lys-rich motif of N protein acted as a nuclear localization signal and was essential for the activation of COX-2. Surjit et al. (34) showed that a short serine-rich stretch, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal and self association through a C-terminal 209 amino acid interaction domain characterize this protein. These studies elucidated the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV N protein entering into nuclear and effecting on host genes. However, Liao et al. (23) found that full-length N protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm and N1\u2013225, N226\u2013300 and N226\u2013422 are located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and the latter two can also be found in the nucleus. The results from our experiments using the entire length of N gene are consistent with it. Our study showed that N protein expressed mainly in cytoplasm of cells transfected with pcDNA-N, which may be related with the distinct sequence and conformation of this SARS-CoV strain influencing its cellular localization. Chung et al. (35) reported that HBx protein-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene activation was dependent on the transcription factor NF-\u03ba B and AP-1 and ERK and PI-3K/AKT signal pathway in the absence of HBx protein nucleoi localization. They suggest that stimulation of ERK and PI-3K/AKT signal pathways by HBx leads to the activation of NF-\u03ba B and AP-1 transcription factor. Then translocation of NF-\u03ba B and AP-1 activated by HBx into the nucleus results in an increase of MMP-9 expression. In our study, although the N protein expressed by constructed full-length of N sequence plasmid from patient's SARS-CoV isolate did not migrate to nucleus, but had the ability to induce hfgl2 expression. The truncated fragment of N protein may have the ability to enter to nucleus or the entire N protein or N fragments affect on a yet-not-identified signal molecule, and the nuclear localization of the signal molecule leads to hfgl2 up-regulated expression.",

Previous work demonstrates mfgl2/hfgl2 expressed in liver plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of experimental and human hepatic failure (FHF) (7\u201312). Fgl2 prothrombinase gene could be regulated by cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and MHV-3 nucleocapsid protein with hepatic nuclear factor 4\u03b1 as a key transcription factor (9, 36, 37). Activated fgl2 prothrombinase played its procoagulant role in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis failure to contribute to the necrosis of hepatocytes (11, 12). Interestingly, both MHV-3 which induced the mfgl2 expression in Balb/cJ mouse and SARS-CoV which induced hfgl2 belong to coronavirus family.",

It was recently shown that the 7a protein of SARS-CoV induces biochemical changes associated with apoptosis. Data indicate that the induction of apoptosis by the 7a protein may be related to its ability to inhibit cellular translation and activate p38 MAPK (38). SARS-CoV 3a and 7a proteins induce apoptosis in mammalian cells was confirmed and membrane protein was currently identified to accelerated induction of apoptosis in insect cells (39).

C/EBP form a subgroup within the basic region/leucine zipper superfamily of transcription factors (bZIP). Members of this family of transcription factors consist of an N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding basic region, and a leucine rich dimerization domain (40, 41). There are six members of the C/EBP family (C/EBP\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b2, C/EBP\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b4, C/EBP\u03b5 and C/EBP\u03b6). C/EBP\u03b1 also named C/EBP alpha forms homodimers or heterodimers with other C/EBP proteins as well as with transcription factors of other families to precisely modulate the transcription of target genes (42). Phosphorylation and sumoylation of C/EBP\u03b1 are suggested to be important regulatory mechanisms which cause changes in function of this protein (43\u201345). It was hypothesized that N protein of SARS-CoV activate transcription factor C/EBP alpha through phosphorylation or sumoylation, and then C/EBP forms homodimers that bind with its cognate cis-element in hfgl2 promoter to induce hfgl2 gene transcription.",

Fibrin or fibrinogen and its fragments in the pathophysiology coagulation derangements are part of these complex diseases. Post-mortem lung samples from six patients who died of SARS from April to July 2003 found fibrin deposition was universal phenomena besides formation of hyaline membranes, diffuse and bilateral lung consolidation and diffuse alveolar damage (14). It was concluded that diffuse damage of lung tissue in SARS patients was partly due to coagulation derangements. These derangements were implicated in the generation of microcirculation thrombosis, with deposition of microclots and obstruction of circulation, impairing blood flow and contributing to tissue hypoperfusion and consequently, organ dysfunction. As shown in SARS animal model, fgl2 prothrombinase gene and other cytokines, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), participated in the development of SARS (17). In our study, the functional hfgl2 prothrombinase activity in a one-stage clotting assay was described and indicated that nucleocapsid protein could shorten clotting time markedly than other proteins. It suggested that nucleocapsid protein of SARS maybe the major agent resulting immuno-coagulation system. This study shed a slight light on the molecular mechanism of SARS and provided a molecular target of treatment in the future.",
