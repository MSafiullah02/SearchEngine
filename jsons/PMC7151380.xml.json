With the expectation of controlling air pollution problem, the Chinese government released and implemented the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the \u201cAction Plan\u201d) in September 2013 (China, 2019b). From the plan, the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) area shall decrease by 25%, 20% and 15% by the end of 2017 compared with 2012, respectively. To fulfill this goal, tremendous effects have been made such as strengthen industrial and vehicle emission standards, closing small and polluting factories, and upgrades on industrial boilers, and air quality has been largely improved (Zhang et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2019; China 2019a). The severe particulate pollution days were decreased from 122 and 33 in 2013 to 31 and 25 in 2017 within BTH and YRD areas (Li et al., 2019).",

In the pollution period of December 20\u201326, 2015 in BTH region, about 34% increasing of PM2.5 are believed due to adverse meteorological condition (Ma et al., 2020). Wu et al. (2019) found a high relative humidity (RH) enhanced aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 explosive growth was the main reason for the 7 days heavy PM2.5 pollution episode in North China Plain in December 2016. In the study of two haze episodes from January 6 to 16 in Chengdu Plain, Li et al. (2017a) indicated that the decreased Planetary boundary layer (PBL) height restrained the air pollutant dispersion and increased RH accelerated the transformation of secondary pollutants. Meteorological condition in winter are more unfavorable to pollutant dilution and dispersion than other three seasons (Yang et al., 2019). Compared with December 2015, the PM2.5 concentration increased by 36% in BTH region. Liu et al. (2017) attributed the increase to unfavorable meteorology of PBL, RH and wind.",

In order to reduce anthropogenic emission, factories, industrial plants, construction sites, and gas stations was temporarily closed in and around Beijing, vehicles were kept off the roads, and 6-days mandatory holidays were brought to state-owned enterprises, local government offices and educational institutions (Sun et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017d; Huang et al., 2015). \u201cAPEC Blue\u201d and \u201cParade Blue\u201d are referred to the good air quality during the time afterward.

Due to the contagion of COVID-19, the unofficial transit going in and out of Wuhan was shut down on January 23, 2020 and in the whole Hubei Province a couple of days after. The 2020 Spring Festival holiday started on January 24, and was extended to after February 10 nationwide because of the disease. Most transportation was prohibited and almost all avoidable outdoor human activities stopped all around the country. However, severe air pollution episodes still occurred in the North China Plain (NCP). It is of great concern for people who are limited to use mobile vehicles on heavy pollution days why severe air pollution events were not avoided when no one was on road.",

The meteorological inputs were generated using WRF v3.7.1 with initial and boundary conditions from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) FNL Operational Model Global Tropospheric Analyses dataset (Zhang et al., 2012a; NCEP, 2000). Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China of 2016 (MEIC) (http://www.meicmodel.org) was used for the monthly anthropogenic emissions from China. Emissions from other countries were obtained from MIX Asian emission inventory (Li et al., 2017b). The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) v2.1 was used for generating biogenic emissions (Guenther et al., 2012). The emissions from biomass burning were based on the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (FINN) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2011).",

The base case scenario (Case 1) is using the original anthropogenic emission inventory of MEIC 2016 for the simulation period. Although the emissions keep changing since 2016, this does not affect the study much as emission inventories usually have larger uncertainties in comparison to changes in a few years (Zhao et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2009; Fu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Compared with the Case 1, Case 2 had a decrease of 40% and 20% in transportation and industry emission, respectively. Emission from residential was lifted by 10% and emissions from agriculture and power remain unchanged. In Case 3, transportation, industry and agriculture emission in Hubei province are decreased by 80% while residential and power emission is kept the same with the Case 1. For areas out of Hubei province, 80% of transportation emission and 20% of industry emission are cut while all the rest are kept still. Since there is no official emission inventory released, emission changes suggested by the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences are being used to set emission reduction scenarios (CRAES 2020). An interview of Professor Kebin He from Tsinghua University refers to the high-pollution in BTH regions in February 2020 by China Central Television (CCTV) was also considered (CCTV, 2020). Many people came back for the Spring Festival and were trapped due to COVID-19 epidemic, the residential emission from cooking and heating was asummed to increase in rural areas including Hebei, Henan and Shandong. The notices released from goverment were the basis for emission reduction in Hubei Province (Hubei, 2020f, 2020e, 2020d, 2020c, 2020b). The governme announced that from 10 am in January 23, 2020, buses, subways, ferries, and long-distance passenger transportation in Wuhan were temporarily suspended, and outbound of railway and air planes were closed (Hubei, P. s. G. o. 2020g). All the enterprises are remaining closed no earlier than February 13 except required for public service operation, epidemic prevention and control, and residential life needs (Hubei, P. s. G. o. 2020a). The agriculture production was highly affected because there was nowhere to buy seeds and fertilizer (Daily, 2020).",

The changes due to emission changes are calculated by subtracting the concentrations in Case 3 from that in Case 1, while the changes due to meteorology are calculated using concentrations in high-pollution days minus concentrations in low-pollution days, assuming that meteorology is the reason for severe pollution as the emissions are not changing day by day.

The GE of WS is within the benchmark, and high RMSE of 2.5 indicated oscillations among prediction results. WD prediction results were acceptable with MB of 8.5 while RH was slightly under-predicted. It should be declared that out of the benchmark does not mean failure of the prediction as the benchmark value is constructed on the MM5 simulations for the eastern United States with finer grid resolutions (12 km and 4 km).
