The disease spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, so-called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was known to be diverse in severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to mild respiratory tract infection and severe or fatal pneumonia. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted within the family, in the community, among cruise passengers and in hospitals, and has become a public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020. As of 28 February 2020, laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 56 countries and territories with more than 83 382 cases reported globally; more than 78 832 of these cases were reported from China ( https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ).",

Using MHV as the tested coronavirus, two of three lineages of wild-type MHV in the presence of increased concentrations of GS-441524 were lost after 17 and 20 repeated passages, and only one lineage after 23 passages selected a low-level resistant mutant, conferring a 5.6-fold increase in the EC 50 [17] . Two amino acid substitutions (F467L and V553L) were noted in non-structural protein (nsp) 12, the RdRp of MHV, and also resulted in a 6-fold increase in the EC 50 in SARS-CoV. However, the remdesivir-resistant MHV with F476L and V553L mutations was outcompeted by wild-type MHV in the absence of GS-5734, suggestive of the effect of remdesivir resistance on decreased viral fitness. Of note, in the mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV-infected mice lost less weight and had a more evident decline in pulmonary viral loads by 4 days after infection than wild-type SARS-CoV-infected mice, indicative of attenuated pathogenicity of remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV. The above findings indicate a high genetic barrier for remdesivir to develop resistance a well as decreased fitness and pathogenicity in remdesivir-resistant mutants, and further encourage the therapeutic potential of remdesivir in the treatment of newly emerging COVID-19.",

Besides, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, prophylactic and early therapeutic dosing of remdesivir effectively decreased the viral load in the lungs and improved pulmonary function [20] .",

Although in the animal study the plasma half-life of remdesivir was short (0.39 h), remdesivir was rapidly distributed into PBMCs, converted into its active form within 2 h post-infusion, and had an intracellular half-life of 14 h. In the absence of any human pharmacokinetic information, such data from rhesus monkeys indicate that parenteral daily dosing of remdesivir may achieve sustained intracellular concentrations of nucleotide triphosphate, which are above its EC 90 for SARS-CoV-2. These in vitro and animal data provide preliminary evidence supporting the clinical potential of remdesivir for human infections caused by contemporary and emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",
