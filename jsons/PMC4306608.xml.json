            "text": "Antibodies are key components of the immune system that are able to bind with great specificity to an extremely large variety of target molecules. In addition to their important function in the adaptive immune response, antibody testing represents a major tool for the diagnosis of many infectious agents including current and past exposures.1 The detection of antibodies against self-proteins, autoantibodies, is also important for the diagnosis of a variety of autoimmune diseases. In some autoimmune diseases, autoantibodies are present before the onset of clinical symptoms, and for certain targets, autoantibodies can play a direct role in causing pathogenesis. Although the full spectrum of diagnostically useful antibodies is not currently known, generating comprehensive antibody profiles will likely represent an important next step in understanding human health. In this review, we describe the antibody profiling technology of luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) and discuss its wide range of applications and the types of information that can be obtained from using the technology. An in-depth discussion of other immunoassay technologies used to measure antibodies can be found in a recent review.1\n",

            "text": "In type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease involving the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, several different autoantibodies have been identified including insulin, glutamic decarboxylase-65, insulinoma-associated protein-2, insulinoma-associated protein-2 beta and zinc transporter-8. Although the radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIP), a fluid-phase immunoassay, is the gold standard for detecting T1D-associated autoantibodies,3 LIPS represents a promising nonradioactive alternative. Comparative studies have shown that both LIPS and RIP have similar sensitivity and specificity for detecting autoantibodies against several major T1D autoantigens.11, 12 For example, the detection of anti-IA2 autoantibodies in patients with T1D by the LIPS demonstrated 85% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and autoantibody values obtained correlated well with radioimmunoprecipitation assay.12 In these studies, the dynamic range of detection for the LIPS assays was greater than the radioimmunoprecipitation assay and spanned 103\u2013105 light units. Several other investigators have successfully used the LIPS as a nonradioactive alternative for measuring autoantibodies in T1D.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Autoantibodies against the relatively newly identified autoantigen, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1, were shown by the LIPS to be more prevalent in patients with T1D harboring autoantibodies against multiple autoantigens.13 Lampasona et al detected high levels of robust autoantibodies by the LIPS against harmonin and villin in most patients with the autoimmune condition immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy X-linked syndrome, but found no evidence of these autoantibodies in T1D.14 It is also important to point out that other immunoassays including ELISA and protein array are often inadequate for detecting autoantibodies in T1D and other autoimmune conditions.3 The lack of diagnostic utility of these solid-phase assays is exemplified by a recent study showing that a protein array technology was unable to detect any significant autoantibody responses against the 2 major known autoantigens, GAD65 and IA2, which were detectable by the LIPS in the serum samples of the same patient with T1D.16\n",

            "text": "Acquiring autoantibody profiles against multiple autoantigen targets in T1D is highly desirable because studies have shown that the number of different islet autoantibodies present in a given individual has the greatest predictive value for determining which children will go on to develop diabetes.18 In addition, patients with T1D can also show evidence of other comorbid autoimmune conditions that can be detected by the presence of autoantibodies associated with these conditions. Because of the modular nature of the assay and the ability of using crude extracts without purification, the LIPS is ideal for testing multiple autoantigens. Additionally, the assay development time is generally much lesser than other solid-phase immunoassays that use native or recombinant proteins. This is because the development of the different light-emitting protein detectors for the LIPS simply involves cloning and transfection in which the extracts can generally be used in a standard format without optimization. In one investigation autoantibodies against 9 targets were measured in patients with T1D.19 Not only did the patients with T1D show a high frequency of T1D-associated autoantibodies, but approximately 50% of the patients with T1D had autoantibody responses against at least one other extrapancreatic target including the thyroid peroxidase associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, transglutaminase 2 associated with celiac disease, and the gastric adenosine triphosphatase associated with autoimmune gastritis. Although the clinical data for this cohort were not available for analysis, this study demonstrates the possibility of using the LIPS to identify patient subgroups with different clinical symptoms or for further examining potential genetic associations.",

Increased GAD65 autoantibodies were also highly detectable in cerebrospinal fluid of the patient, and the autoantibody levels correlated over time with clinical severity suggesting that central nervous system autoimmunity might be responsible for psychomotor impairment.

LIPS showed 75% sensitivity for the detection of La autoantibodies compared with 45% sensitivity for an established ELISA in a small cohort of patients with SS and healthy controls.24 For SSA, the LIPS separately detected autoantibodies against Ro52 and Ro60 and showed similar diagnostic performance to that of the ELISA, which measured them together. Measuring autoantibodies against other targets also revealed that some patients also had significant autoantibodies associated with other autoimmune conditions. For example, 16% of patients with SS had autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase, an autoantigen associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Similarly, 14% and 12% of the patients with SS had autoantibodies against gastric adenosine triphosphatase and aquaporin 4, respectively, representing potential autoimmune attack on the stomach and nervous system.24 Compared with the standard 2.5 hour\u2013testing format, a rapid 15-minute LIPS test showed promise for detecting anti-Ro52 serum autoantibodies for the diagnosis of SS.6 The highly robust LIPS assay can be used for noninvasive testing by using saliva instead of a serum as the clinical sample. Using saliva, Ro60 autoantibodies showed 75% sensitivity and 96% specificity for the diagnosis of SS and correlated with serum levels of Ro60 autoantibody.25 The ability to examine antibodies in saliva has additional applications for noninvasively studying humoral responses against infectious agents.",

            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represents a relatively common autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and chronic immune attack on various cells and tissues.23 The detection of autoantibodies in SLE is critical for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and can predict disease onset.26, 27 Ching et al28 used the LIPS to detect autoantibodies against a panel of autoantigens revealing that most patients with SLE had either a cluster I or cluster II antibody phenotype. Patients with a cluster I phenotype showed enriched autoantibodies against Sm, U1-RNP-A1, and U1-70K RNP RNA-binding proteins, whereas patients with a cluster II phenotype had enriched autoantibodies against Ro52, Ro60, and La. The exact method for analyzing the LIPS autoantibody data from the patients with SLE simply involved comparing the responses against Sm, U1-RNP-A1, and U1-70K RNP vs Ro52, Ro60, and La. In contrast, a previous study based on ELISA immunoassay results identified the 2 similar autoantibody clusters in SLE using the relatively complex K-means clustering algorithm.29 Overall, these findings highlight the ease of antibody analysis when robust and highly quantitative values are generated by the LIPS technology. Another unique feature of the LIPS is the possibility of using antigen mixtures for achieving high diagnostic performance from a single test.28, 30, 31 The mixture format is based on the fact that the protein A/G beads used in the assay bind many different immunoglobulins present in serum. When incubated with multiple light-emitting antigens, these bound immunoglobulins can interact with multiple detectors yielding an overall signal similar to performing these tests separately (Fig 1). In the case of the diagnosis of lupus, a single LIPS mixture test incorporating 6 antigens (Sm, U1-RNP-A1, U1-70K RNP, Ro52, Ro60, and La) combined with 1 \u03bcL of serum matched the sensitivity and specificity of performing these 6 individual LIPS tests separately.28 Because this approach does not provide information about the specific target proteins that are immunoreactive in seropositive samples, if needed, additional follow-up testing of individual antigens would need to be performed. Nevertheless, this LIPS mixture approach saves time and resources and has also been used to simplify the diagnosis of several infectious agents.30, 31\n",

The LIPS detected high levels of anticytokine autoantibodies in several diseases including in certain patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis,32 SLE,28 and in opportunistic infections secondary to anticytokine autoantibodies.33, 34 In patients with thymoma exhibiting opportunistic infections such as mucocandidiasis and disseminated varicella-zoster virus, the LIPS identified multiple anticytokine autoantibodies as the likely culprits involved in pathogenesis.34 Although the LIPS detected known increased levels of anti\u2013interferon alfa autoantibodies, high levels of autoantibodies against interleukin (IL)-12 p35, IL-12\u2013p40, and IL-17 correlated better with the presence of opportunistic infections in these patients. The levels of autoantibodies detected by the LIPS against these cytokines also matched functional assays for signal transducer and activator of transcription neutralization experiments. Lastly, this study also highlighted how the LIPS can be used for autoantigen discovery. In this study, systematic LIPS screening of 39 different candidate cytokines resulted in the discovery of 2 patients with previously undescribed autoantibodies against the B cell-activating factor cytokine.34\n",

From analyzing autoantibodies against 41 cytokine and other immune targets, approximately 90% of the patients with dNTM infections demonstrated interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) autoantibodies, which routinely were 1000 times greater than the levels found in the controls. The levels of IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies detected by the LIPS in the serum samples of patients with dNTM infections also tracked their ability to neutralize downstream signaling activity as detected by in vitro assays. One patient with dNTM infection did not have IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies, but showed high levels of anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies.33 Remarkably, no significant autoantibody seropositivity was detected against the other cytokines. These results suggest that the LIPS technology is useful for identifying pathogenic autoantibodies against cytokines and potentially other extracellular targets.",

In a subsequent HIV study, humoral responses were examined by the LIPS against 9 HIV proteins in patients with low HIV viral load including elite controllers, antiretroviral-treated patients, and in the Berlin patient, the first patient cured.53 A key finding was that the Berlin patient had undetectable antibodies against p24 and 5 other HIV proteins, but still had weak HIV antibody responses against tat, gp41, and reverse transcriptase. In another study of patients coinfected with HCV-HIV, a novel HCV antibody biomarker profile was identified by the LIPS, which correlated with response to treatment with interferon alfa and ribavirin.43 Overall, these results with HIV and HCV suggest that these quantitative antibody profiles generated by the LIPS could be used to monitor therapy.",

For example, numerous astroviruses have been identified by metagenomic sequencing of human stool,55, 56 but the in vivo relevance of these agents is unknown. LIPS testing of one of the new astroviruses, HMOAstV-C, revealed significant antibodies to the capsid of this virus in humans, but not in several animal species including pigs and rabbits. Further analysis of samples from children revealed that approximately 20% of 1-year-old children and approximately 65% of adults showed antibodies against HMOAstV-C.57 These findings support the incorporation of high-quality serologic LIPS data for accelerating the discovery of new pathogens obtained from nucleic acid discovery efforts.",

In one study, the LIPS was used to identify the natural reservoir of HCV-like viruses in nonprimates.58 The area of research was initially started by Kapoor et al,59 who discovered the first nonprimate homolog of HCV called canine hepativirus in 2 dogs. No serology was performed at that time, and the development of a subsequent LIPS test against the capsid and helicase regions of canine hepacivirus failed to detect antibodies in more than 120 canine serum samples suggesting that infection by this virus may be a rare event in dogs. However, additional testing of a variety of other animals revealed that approximately 40% of horses showed robust antibody responses against the helicase. DNA analysis of the seropositive horses identified 8 new genetically distinct nonhuman primate hepatitis-like viruses in these equine samples and established horses as a major reservoir of HCV-like viruses.58 More recently, LIPS was used to investigate the animal reservoir of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, a potential lethal viral infection in humans occurring in Saudi Arabia.60 Although no serologic evidence for MERS infection was observed in sheep and goats, camels were identified as a source of MERS. These results highlight how the LIPS can be used to discover novel pathogens in animals, which can cause zoonotic infections in humans.",

One important opportunity for personalized health profiles will be to define individual exposure profiles to multiple infectious agents. As a proof of concept, the LIPS was used to measure antibodies against 13 common infectious agents in 3 different chronic diseases, patients with HIV, IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies, and SS.61 Rather than focusing on antibody responses to any one individual infectious agents, the cumulative antibody data were modeled by principal component analysis. For both patients with HIV and patients with high levels of autoantibodies against IFN-\u03b3, a distinct antibody profile was observed compared with healthy control subjects. Moreover, there was a noticeable difference between these profiles highlighting the fact that each disease perturbs different specific immune pathways.61 In contrast, the SS cohort did not reveal an informative profile suggesting that these infectious agents might be less relevant for this disease.61 On the basis of these promising findings, it is likely that the incorporation of additional infectious agent targets into the panel might make this approach even more informative. Finally, the ability to profile so many different infectious agents in a single format presents a powerful tool for diagnosis and personalized medicine and might be configured into a novel immune readout of overall immune health.",

Four major attributes make LIPS a highly desirable technology for studying antibodies: (1) an assay that does not require radioactivity, (2) the possibility of stably storing the fusion antigen extracts for facile testing on demand, (3) the high signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) the wide dynamic range of antibody detection. Because the LIPS requires small amounts of serum, hundreds of targets could theoretically be profiled with the serum obtained from several milliliters of processed blood. Besides testing one protein at a time, LIPS arrays offer an alternative format for simultaneously multiple antibodies in which different light-emitting protein targets are tested in individual wells of a 96-well plate with control and test serum samples. As a proof of concept, LIPS arrays detected highly robust immunoreactivity against multiple proteins derived from HCV, HIV, and EBV proteomes in infected subjects compared with uninfected controls.8 On the basis of these results, LIPS arrays could be used as a discovery tool for simultaneously measuring antibody levels against candidate target proteins in autoimmune and infectious diseases.",

One strategy for predictive medicine involves monitoring antibodies longitudinally over time to many different targets. Along these lines, it is conceivable that a library of known autoantigen targets used in LIPS could prove sufficient for the broad diagnosis of many common autoimmune disorders. Because it is currently known that autoantibodies are present years before clinical onset of several autoimmune conditions including T1D,62 SLE,26 and SS,63 and it is possible that LIPS and other assays, along with clinical information including association with family members and the presence of risk genes, could be efficiently used to identify individuals at high risk for developing these and other conditions including cancer and other age-related neurologic diseases. In addition, the approach of using LIPS serology to profile antibodies against multiple infectious agents could be used to identify novel agents that might contribute to inflammation and impact the likelihood of developing certain diseases. Most importantly, these antibody profiles might be used for early detection thereby identifying patients before the clinical onset, which may allow a change in lifestyle or treatment options that might delay or further prevent disease onset or progression.",

(A) The DNA sequence of the antigen of interest is genetically fused to the C-terminus of Renilla luciferase (Ruc). These recombinant plasmids are then used to transfect Cos1 cells and cell lysate is harvested 48 hours later without purification. (B) Aliquots of a single extract for a Ruc-antigen or a mixture of multiple extracts for different Ruc-antigens are then incubated with serum samples. The antibody complexes are then captured by protein A/G beads and the unbound luciferase-tagged antigen is washed away. The amount of specific antibodies present is then determined by the amount of bound antigen present by adding luciferase substrate.",
