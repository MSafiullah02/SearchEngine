However, as the most serious classification of AP, there are few articles concerning the poor outcomes associated with SAP. In addition, all of the above methods are complicated or lack high accuracy [15] and are therefore of restricted clinical use and are not recommended by the new Atlanta international consensus and American guidelines [1, 2].

In addition, previous studies have also found that the presence of elevated arterial lactate levels reflects critical tissue hypoperfusion, which is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [16\u201321]. A recent study has shown that elevated serum lactate is a new biomarker that could be an important tool in predicting poor outcomes of AP on admission, especially in predicting death [22]. Thus, we assume that arterial lactate may be a potentially promising biomarker to risk-stratify patients with SAP. However, the association between arterial lactate levels and outcomes in SAP has not been reported to date.",

The patient was classified as SAP based on the presence of persistent organ failure (POF) for more than 48 h (defined by modified Marshall scoring system\u22652). Organ failure included the cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary, and/or renal systems, accompanied by a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after continuous fluid resuscitation, PaO2 / FiO2 \u2264 300 or the need for mechanical ventilation, serum creatinine level > 1.9 mg/dl after rehydration or hemodialysis without preexisting renal disease [1]. The patient was classified as having a pancreatic infection based on the presence of gas collections in the pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissues on contrast-enhanced computed tomography or based on a positive Gram stain and culture for bacteria and/or fungi from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, percutaneous catheter drainage, and endoscopic transluminal drainage [1]. The diagnosis of septic shock was based on Chinese guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2014, meeting the following criteria: hypotension caused by sepsis (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or drops more than 40 mmHg) after fluid therapy [23].

In 2010, a systematic review involving fourteen studies proved that organ failure and infected pancreatic necrosis were determinants of mortality in patients with AP, especially in cases of critical acute pancreatitis [25]. This implies that the ability to risk-stratify patients during the most proximal phase of SAP is of great importance for determining the need for initial intensive care and other therapeutic strategies. However, current prognostic markers in SAP have some limitations. First, the primary outcomes for most of the previously studied markers and system scores were necrosis or organ failure, rather than mortality, septic shock and pancreatic infection, which are too inconvenient to use in clinical practice to determine system scores [10, 11, 13, 15]. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin may be useful in predicting severity. However, it takes a great deal of time to receive the results [12].

There are several possible explanations for this outcome. First, it is well known that an important reason for the worsening of AP is that insufficient blood volume, due to various causes, increases hypoperfusion of the pancreas and other vital organs, leading to pancreatic necrosis and organ dysfunction [28]. We believe that the admission arterial lactate level may reflect the underlying state of intravascular volume scarcity and vital organ perfusion (including kidney, gut, liver and even heart). Conversely, the damage to major organ functions further increases the level of arterial lactate through impaired lactate clearance and excessive production [27, 29]. Second, lactate has been regarded as a marker of tissue hypoxia in critically ill patients [21, 30]. The main function of the lung is to supply oxygen to tissues. Thus, lactate is likely to represent the degree of pulmonary failure. Persistent pulmonary failure is usually the direct cause of death in SAP. Third, lactate is also considered an early biomarker of the response to inflammatory mediators [31\u201333]. Lactic acid may indicate the extent of the inflammatory response in SAP. Mofidi R et al. found that persistent SIRS is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death in patients with acute pancreatitis and is an early indicator of the likely severity of acute pancreatitis [6]. Fourth, patients with SAP have high energy metabolism [19, 34], which may be achieved by increasing aerobic glycolysis. If the amount of pyruvic acid produced by aerobic glycolysis exceeds the metabolic capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, it will lead to the accumulation of lactate. Levy et al. revealed that elevated lactate may be associated with increasing Na+ K+ ATPase activity in septic shock patients [21]. Therefore, lactate may also reflect the state of energy metabolism in SAP. Regardless of the specific mechanism involved, our research clearly showed that patients with elevated arterial lactate levels with early-stage SAP have an increased risk of mortality and of both mild and serious complications.",

We adopted the approach that the mean value and the lactate value on the next day must be separated by 6 h to reduce this impact. Third, some patients received rehydration therapy before admission.
