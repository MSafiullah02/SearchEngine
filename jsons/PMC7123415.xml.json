While the incidence of diarrhea in children is similar throughout the world (2.7 episodes/child/year), mortality is mainly concentrated in low-middle income countries (Southeast Asia and Africa) in relation to known risk factors (poverty, malnutrition, poor access to health facilities, vitamin deficits) (Fischer Walker et al. 2013). Although the implementation of effective measures resulted in a significant reduction of global mortality in the past two decades, the number of deaths attributable to diarrhea, most of which preventable, is still unacceptable and much remains to be done (Bhutta et al. 2013). The most urgent challenges are represented by the implementation of and access to effective strategies in poorest areas and the impact of mass population dislocation (for conflicts or disasters) as well as of climate change on the spread of infections (Bhutta et al. 2013; Hershey et al. 2011; Carlton et al. 2015). The burden of GE in the neonatal age is generally reduced in relation to some protective factors (breastfeeding, minimal exposure to water and contaminated food, passive maternal immunity); nevertheless, it is estimated that approximately 17,000 newborns die each year for GE (WHO 2015; O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). The low birth weight, prematurity, and reduced gastric acidity are well-recognized risk factors for more severe gastrointestinal infections in this age group (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Worldwide, up to 40% of hospitalizations in children aged less than 5 years with diarrhea are due to infection (Ciccarelli et al. 2013). This microorganism is considered as the most frequent cause of GE and one of the main causes of death by dehydration (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Kotloff et al. 2013). It is an RNA virus with at least three human serotypes (A, B, and C), the most frequent of which is A. Rotavirus probably infect newborns more commonly than previously recognized and with most infections being asymptomatic. The incubation period is short (1\u20133 days), and it can be responsible of outbreaks in nurseries. The pathogenetic mechanism is based on the infection of mature enterocytes located in the middle and upper villus epithelium, probably following cell entry using lactase as receptor. The alterations of the mucosal surface lead to a watery diarrhea. The reduced amount of lactase in the premature (<32 weeks) justifies the lower frequency of infection in these patients. The child may acquire the infection from the birth canal, but the most common mode of transmission is between infants through the hands of healthcare workers. The possibility of airborne transmission is still debated. Cases of meningitis-encephalitis, Reye syndrome, neonatal enterocolitis, and Kawasaki disease related to Rotavirus infection have also been described (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011).",

            "text": "E. rapidly colonizes the intestinal tract of healthy newborns during the first days of life and constitutes the predominant intestinal aerobic flora throughout life. However, some pathogenic strains can cause diarrhea by different mechanisms. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is considered a worldwide problem since it represents one of the main bacterial causes of childhood diarrhea in developing countries and is significantly associated with death in children 0\u201311 months of age (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Kotloff et al. 2013). Although its incidence is higher after 6 months of age, neonatal outbreaks have been described (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). Transmission occurs through the contaminated birth canal or horizontally from other adult carriers. The disease is mediated by several genetic virulence factors, can vary widely, but usually appears as a non-bloody diarrhea (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) produces two types of toxin (LT heat-labile and ST heat-stable enterotoxin) determining a secretory response of the intestinal mucosa similar to that induced by the cholera toxin. It is considered a significant pathogen and a common cause of moderate to severe diarrhea in developing countries; neonatal outbreaks have been observed (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Kotloff et al. 2013). Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) serotypes exhibit a characteristic aggregative pattern of adherence and produce persistent diarrhea in infants and children in resource-limited nations (Ciccarelli et al. 2013). Its frequency seems to be higher than previously recognized, and several nursery outbreaks have been described (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) causes diarrhea by means of a Shigella-like intestinal epithelial invasion producing a dysentery-like syndrome, although the clinical manifestations may be milder than those of shigellosis. Little is known about the epidemiology in newborns (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) has been recognized as an emerging gastrointestinal pathogens in most of the industrialized world. A particular subset of STEC, enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), produces a clinical syndrome characterized by bloody diarrhea. Its exact incidence in the neonatal age is unclear, although it has been described in children (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). The most virulent EHEC belongs to serotype O157: H7, it has an animal reservoir, and is transmitted by contaminated food. Its dangerousness is related to the association with the emergence of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011).",

In most cases, the diarrheic feces of the patients represent the primary source of infection with the possibility of person-to-person transmission either directly or by water and environment contamination. Other microorganisms (NT Salmonella, Campylobacter) colonize the gut of different animal species with a risk of infection mainly related to the consumption of contaminated food. In resource-limited settings, these transmission patterns frequently overlap, and spread of gastrointestinal infections is amplified by factors such as overcrowding, poor hygiene, scarce availability of safe water, lack of efficient waste disposal, and insufficient health education (Bhutta et al. 2013; O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011). In neonatal infection, the acquisition of the pathogen may occur by different ways: through the contaminated birth canal during the first days of life, or, especially in the nosocomial setting, through the use of contaminated tools, objects, or milk, and through the hands of the caregivers (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013).

            "text": " Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting. According to the WHO, diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than what is considered normal for a given individual (WHO 2014). In the neonatal period, it may be difficult to define a diarrhea, since the feces of infants (especially when breastfed) may be relatively frequent, soft-liquid, and with large variability between subjects (Ciccarelli et al. 2013). In the diagnosis of GE, the previous bowel habits and the general condition of the newborn should therefore be taken into account. Typically, the GE of the neonatal period are acute, self-limiting diseases and are mild to moderate in severity. The presence of a pathogen in the intestinal tract can also result in colonization in the absence of disease. The virulence of the microorganism, the amount of the inoculum and several individual factors (e.g., prematurity, low birth weight, malnutrition, etc.) affect both the risk and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation may vary widely and some accompanying symptoms may be fever, vomiting, food refusal, dehydration, abdominal distension, and lethargy. In the management of GE, it is essential to assess the degree of dehydration and the type of diarrhea (watery or bloody), which is a relevant correlate of the presence of invasive pathogens. The risk of dehydration in children is very high and can rapidly lead to hypovolemic shock and death, regardless of the etiology. For certain bacterial infections, intestinal and extraintestinal complications are also possible (Table 2) (Bhutta et al. 2013; O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013). It should be noted that while the occurrence of diarrhea in the neonatal age is generally caused by acute gastrointestinal infections, differential diagnosis with several other diseases should be considered (Table 3). In particular, it should be emphasized that diarrhea may be one of the several clinical signs of severe systemic bacterial or viral infections. The occurrence of more episodes of diarrhea in highly endemic areas, or during malnutrition, may lead to chronic diarrhea that impacts the growth and development of the child. Stunting may in turn lead to subsequent disability. Moreover, after an acute episode of GE, it is not uncommon to observe persistent diarrhea due to secondary deficiency of disaccharidases (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013). ",

For this reason, it is important to evaluate the history of contact with other subjects presenting similar symptoms and, if not exclusively breastfed, the possible exposure to contaminated water. The assessment of the degree of dehydration, the severity of the clinical picture, and differential diagnostic possibilities are the cornerstone of the management of every acute diarrhea (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013). The etiological diagnosis is based on the demonstration of the microorganism (or its toxins) in stools, although in many cases of mild GE it is not essential, since the disease is usually self-limited. In more severe cases, it is relevant to identify etiologies that may benefit from antibiotic therapy in addition to rehydration. In this regard, especially in countries with limited economic and diagnostic resources, clinical criteria differentiating watery versus bloody diarrhea are relevant in order to initiate empiric antibiotic treatment of invasive pathogens (Table 1). For this purpose, the microscopic search for mucous or leukocytes in the stool may be useful. In relation to the diagnosis performed by the microbiology laboratory, it is important to underline that standard stool cultures do not allow to identify pathogenic strains of E. coli, for which more complex diagnostic methods are required, available in reference centers only. For some pathogens (e.g., Yersinia, Aeromonas), the laboratory must be informed for the need to use specific culture media or assays which are not included in the routine workflows. In case of bloody diarrhea or Salmonella infection, blood cultures are required and, when clinically indicated, cerebrospinal fluid culture, in order to exclude the possibility of disseminated infection. The main viruses causing GE (Rotavirus and Adenovirus) are detected in stool by rapid Latex or immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA). The diagnosis of toxigenic Clostridium difficile infection is based on the combined search for a common fecal antigen (ELISA) and the toxin gene (generally by polymerase chain reaction, PCR). The use of PCR or other nucleic acid amplification techniques may also aid the diagnosis for other viral etiologies (Norovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus, etc.) and for typing strains of bacterial pathogens (e.g., E. coli). In case of suspected intestinal parasitosis, it is appropriate to complete the diagnosis by repeated parasitological fecal examination especially in highly endemic areas (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013).",

For this reason, the assessment of the degree of dehydration is the cornerstone in the management of any diarrhea. According to current WHO recommendations, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is considered the treatment of choice to replace fluid and electrolyte losses caused by diarrhea in children with mild to moderate dehydration (Ciccarelli et al. 2013; WHO 2014). Despite its proven efficacy, ORT remains underused (Piescik-Lech et al. 2013). Different oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are available generally with low osmolarity (210\u2013250 mOsm/L) and variable concentration of sodium, sugar, and other electrolytes (Ciccarelli et al. 2013). Efforts to improve the palatability and the efficacy of ORS are still continuing (Piescik-Lech et al. 2013). In case of patients unable to drink or persistently vomiting, the introduction of ORT via a nasogastric tube can be considered. Intravenous rehydration is the treatment of choice in cases of failure of ORT, as well as for patients with severe dehydration (see 10.1007/978-3-319-29489-6_234\u201d). The hospitalization of an infant with diarrhea is recommended in cases of moderate to severe dehydration or in the presence of bloody diarrhea or systemic symptoms. Continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended, and formulated milk interruption is controversial, since enteral nutrition seems to favor the recovery of intestinal functions (WHO 2014; Piescik-Lech et al. 2013). Diarrhea is associated with significant zinc loss, and the use of zinc supplementation can reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea in children. In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of moderate malnutrition is high, zinc supplementation may be of benefit in children aged 6 months or older. For this reason, WHO recommends zinc supplementation in children with GE (WHO 2014). Nevertheless, current evidence does not support the use of zinc in children under 6 months of age (Ciccarelli et al. 2013). Although the use of probiotics (Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii), antisecretory drugs (racecadotril), and of antiemetics (ondansetron) have all shown efficacy in the treatment of GE in childhood, there are insufficient data to recommend them in neonatal age (Bhutta et al. 2013; Ciccarelli et al. 2013; Piescik-Lech et al. 2013; Freedman et al. 2013). Usually, neonatal GE are mild and self-limiting and do not require antibiotic therapy. The use of empiric antibiotic therapy should be reserved to cases of newborns with systemic symptoms and severe dehydration or in the presence of bloody diarrhea. The use of antibiotics is still debated for some etiologies (EPEC, ETEC, etc.), contraindicated in other (EHEC) or recommended in the presence of some enteroinvasive pathogens (Salmonella NT, Campylobacter, Shigella), or other microorganisms (Vibrio cholerae, C. difficile). Due to the widespread diffusion of antibiotic resistance among many enteropathogens, the evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility is always recommended (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011).",

Consensus exists about the importance of improving safe water supply, of adequate sanitation, and of proper hygiene for the prevention of infectious diseases, especially diarrheal diseases (Bhutta et al. 2013). It is well known that exclusive breastfeeding is protective against intestinal infections and prevents exposure to environmental contamination (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013). The protective effects of breastfeeding against GE infections have been demonstrated in several studies. Antibacterial substances, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, phagocytes, and specific immunoglobulins, are responsible for the protective role of breast milk. Breastfeeding also promotes the formation of a competitive intestinal flora against pathogens (O\u2019Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013). Some of the infections causing GE are vaccine-preventable diseases. Although vaccines against Rotavirus and cholera have demonstrated clearly positive results in terms of safety and efficacy, these are administered after the neonatal period (Bhutta et al. 2013; Ciccarelli et al. 2013). Recent studies based on mathematical models have suggested that the implementation of all the effective strategies for the control of diarrhea (hygiene and sanitation, breastfeeding, zinc supplementation, vaccines, and adequate and prompt therapy) could reduce global deaths from GE in pediatric age from 54% to 95% by 2025 (Bhutta et al. 2013).",
