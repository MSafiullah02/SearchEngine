These include a decreased number of clinical cases related to the specialty, staff shortage, cancelation of educational conferences, and difficulties conducting formal in-training and licensing examinations. Trainees, program directors, licensing bodies, and other stakeholders are in a difficult situation regarding what to do next. Such a situation raises several critical questions related to the training that we tried to address here.",

However, there is a delicate balance between continuing graduating physicians and maintaining/ensuring the quality of graduating doctors. Slight modification or shoveling some of the rotations to different allocations can be done to accommodate the current situation and educational needs. Yes, some medical or surgical specialties will be affected by the current lockdown more so than other specialties. Professional educators should think outside the box about different ways of accommodating the trainees' educational needs. For instance, clinical research rotation can be utilized during such time for the profoundly affected specialties.",

These include, and are not limited to, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), in-training evaluation reports (ITER), objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), logbook or portfolio, and others [2] . Licensing examinations usually include all of the above-mentioned methods and take place in a predefined location that trainees may need to travel to in order to complete such exams. Besides, a gathering is usually extensive, which may not be permissible during such lockdown status. However, within these lockdowns, we need to rethink how to do things differently, while maintaining high quality of the assessment tools. With an existing plethora of online technology like Zoom, Cisco Webex, and many others, such exams like OSCE can be done remotely without the need for travel and a large gathering of trainees and examiners. Further details can be reviewed in Table 1 .",

Online half day: Academic teleconference across the centers, where the staffs from different centers collaborate and share their educational loads and needs. Utilize online resources like lecture series or webinars. Evaluation issues [no travels, no gathering] Online MCQ and OSCE: Through videoconferencing technology, where the trainee can participate in the exam from his or her home or hospital.
