Recently, because of improved detection techniques, viral infections have been increas-ingly recognized as a cause of asthma exacerbation in children. A recent study of schoolchildren showed that 80-85% of episodes of acute asthma are associated with a respiratory viral infection (2) . Many studies show that respiratory virus infections precipitate acute exacerbation of asthma and are the commonest reason for admission to hospital (3, 4) .",

The observation that infants and younger children with RSV infection have symptoms of greater severity could be partly attributed to the increased number of eosinophils in the respiratory tract. Experiments with animals and clinical studies have implied that eosinophilia is associated with viral infections in asthma (9, 10) . A massive infiltration of eosinophils has been observed in asthmatic patients during viral infection (11) . Thus, eosinophil infiltration is considered to be a crucial element of the pathology leading to clinical exacerbation of asthma. Furthermore, recent research has proposed that analysis of the respiratory mucosa secretion is a more accurate diagnostic test than measurement of blood eosinophils for detecting airway eosinophilic inflammation (12) . Therefore, our result from testing NPS eosinophils was more reliable for reflecting the airway inflammation of asthmatic children.",
