A consortium of foreign experts collaborating with Chinese colleagues of various specializations has sought to hold on this outbreak 6 . The first infected cases were associated with a food market in Wuhan 1 . Coronaviruses have enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA genome, infecting humans and a wide range of animals. They were for the first time characterized and cultured by Tyrell and Bynoe in 1966, from patients with flu and common cold 7 . They were known as coronaviruses, based on their morphology as spherical virions with a central shell and surface projections identical to a solar corona (Latin: corona means crown) 8 . There are four separate subfamilies, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. Alpha and beta coronaviruses appear to come from mammals, especially from bats, whereas gamma and delta coronaviruses derive from pigs and birds 9 . The genome length ranges from 26kb to 32kb. Among the seven subtypes of coronavirus that may have the ability to infect humans the beta-coronavirus is considered the most dangerous; this is the one that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans. SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus 9, 10 .",

One week after infection the conditions become harsh and lead to breath shortening with approximately 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment and medication 29 . The COVID-19 illness appears to seldom induce runny nose, sneezing or sore throat (only around 5% of patients have such symptoms). Painful throat sneezing, and stuffy nose are typically symptoms of seasonal flu or cold 39, 40 . A few patients may develop pain or hemoptysis and many may also be completely asymptomatic 24, 41 . Older people with comorbidity and serious alveolar injury are more prone to experience respiratory failure 42 . The onset of disease will demonstrate rapid progression to organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, shock, acute cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS) and death in severe cases 41 . Sometime patients might develop lower or normal white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia or lymphopenia, with increased C-reactive protein level and extended activated thromboplastin time 24, 41, 42 . 80% of infected cases are found to be mild, with normal fever and flu and the patients can recover at home.

The drug that could potentially prevent SARS-COV-2 infection at low molecular concentrations is chloroquine, with a halfmaximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.13 \u03bcM and a half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) greater than 100 \u03bcm 53 . However, in treating malaria, there are minor risks for adverse events, such as macular retinopathy and cardiomyopathy, whichare side effects caused by long term use of chloroquine [54] [55] [56] . Evidently, chloroquine could be used for the treatment of COVID-19 because of its effectiveness and safety for long term use 57 . A narrative letter by Chinese authors reported that chloroquine phosphate used in many clinical trials has marked efficacy against COVID-19. After oral administration, chloroquine is distributed widely across the body, including the lung. The EC90 value in Vero E6 cells was 6.90 \u03bcM, that can be clinically attainable in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received 500 mg administration, which is demonstrated in their plasma 53 .

Additional information on chloroquine's effects and usefulness for the treatment of COVID-19 patients will soon be published due to its experimental use in the emerging outbreak. Due to the high number of patients infected and the lack of approved drugs, timely release of this information may be critical. The WHO confirms that there is currently no evidence from randomized control trials to warn about specific COVID-19 drug treatments and that unlicensed therapies can only be performed in the sense of ethically-approved clinical trials or under strict supervision of the Controlled Emergency Use of Unregistered Procedures System (MEURI). Meanwhile, the recommendations for \"Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) infection is suspected\" 59 . The authors tend to agree with this viewpoint of WHO to view chloroquine as experimental. The outbreak is not the perfect environment for doing so, but even the use of chloroquine off-label can be followed by many concerns; the first being the health of patients, which should be followed by close supervision. The ethical approach to off-label drug use also varies from country to country, raising concerns regarding equity. Off-label drug use could cause severe medication shortages when needed for malaria, since chloroquine remains a crucial medication in the treatment of malaria in many parts of the world 60 .",

Preliminary measures recommended by the panel include blood tests to rule out the risk of anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia, as well as serum electrolyte abnormalities and/or hepatic and renal function dysfunctions. It is recommended to rule out the development of QT interval prolongation or bradycardia and to perform patient interviews to find out visual and/or mental disturbance. Electrocardiography was routinely recommended and quinolones, macrolides, ondansetron as well as various antiarrhythmic, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs which prolong the QT interval should be avoided as recommended by the panel 61 .",

Recently, it was recognized as a potential antiviral medication against a broad variety of RNA viruses (including SARS / MERS-CoV) in cultivated cells, mice and nonhuman primates (NHP) models [62] [63] [64] . The EC90 value of remdesivir in Vero E6 cells against SARS-CoV-2 was 1.76 \u03bcM, indicating that its working concentration is likely to be attained in NHP models. The remdesivir has also effectively inhibited virus infection in a human cell line (Huh-7 cells of human liver cancer) that is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 65 . Animal experiments showed that remdesivir can significantly reduce the viral load of MERS-CoV in the lung tissue of infected mice, enhance lung function and minimize pathological damage to the lung tissue 66 .",
