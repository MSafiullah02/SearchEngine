            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious disease that affects laying hen and broiler production (Cavanagh and Naqui, 2003). Infectious bronchitis is caused by a coronavirus, the IB virus (IBV), which primarily induces respiratory disease. Nevertheless, the virus is able to replicate in nonepithelial respiratory tissues, where it can cause disease (Dhinakar Raj and Jones, 1997; Cavanagh, 2003, 2007). The clinical signs of respiratory infection include coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge. However, the economic importance of IB is that infection decreases the weight gain of infected broilers as well as the egg quality and production of infected laying hens (Cavanagh and Naqui, 2003; Alvarado et al., 2006). In addition, IB can lead to secondary infections by Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Matthijs et al., 2003). Infections by different IBV strains have been reported worldwide, mainly in regions with heavy poultry industry activity, such as the United States and Europe (Zanella et al., 2003).",

A total of 40 broiler flocks vaccinated with the Massachusetts strain on their day of birth were studied. From the total population, 17 flocks were assigned to the control group and 23 to the case group. In each flock, 3 chickens were taken randomly and necropsied, in which the trachea, cecal tonsils, and deep pectoral muscles with and without myopathy were sampled according to the group. In a third cranial portion of the trachea, approximately 3 cm of trachea was collected. As to the muscle samples, it was obtained from the supracoracoid muscle, limited to the lesion area in myopathy cases and in the central muscle area for controls. About 3 cm3 of muscle were collected. Muscles samples were collected by federal inspectors on the slaughter line. Sampling was performed in duplicate.

In addition, a review by De Wit (2000) cited the kidneys and cecal tonsils as superior choices when sampling chronic infections. Furthermore, De Wit (2000) reported that detection success is affected by several factors, including the time between the beginning of infection and sampling, quality and choice of organs, and chicken immunity levels.
