The relative contribution of serotype and genetic background to disease potential is complex and not well defined. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al. describe strains of different capsule types that act as either opportunistic pathogens in patients with underlying conditions (i.e. 11A, 19F, 23F) or as primary pathogens in healthy individuals (i.e. 1, 7F) [10]. In addition, strains from the same clonal complex that express different capsules have different disease potentials. For example, STO 9V-A with serotype 14 is more likely to act as a primary pathogen than STO 9V-A with serotype 19A [10]. Sabharwal et al. also demonstrate that two serotype 6A strains with different sequence types produce different disease patterns in the chinchilla model of experimental OM, further providing evidence that both capsule and non-capsule genes contribute to pneumococcal virulence [15].",

Furthermore, the post-vaccine era has been characterized by a shift in the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae associated with OM. Among vaccinated children, the proportion of acute OM caused by non-vaccine serotypes and vaccine-related serotypes has increased since 2000 [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Capsule switching and expansion of non-vaccine serotypes have been proposed to explain these shifts in serotype-specific prevalence. As non-vaccine serotypes increase in prevalence, there has been a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance among these strains [19], [21], [22]. One such lineage, ST19919A, has been identified as responsible for a large proportion of replacement disease in the United States; serotype 19A is associated with multidrug resistance and ST199 is associated with penicillin resistance [21], [23], [24], [25].",

            "text": "Understanding pneumococcal virulence requires disentangling the impact of capsular and non-capsular genetic contributions. Our goal is to compare clinically relevant strains of the same sequence type (ST) and different serotypes. We selected ST19919A and ST19915B/C strains to characterize in an experimental OM chinchilla model [12], [15]. Most bacterial competition studies involve the transformation of strains with selectable markers, such as antibiotic resistance or carbon utilization genes; studies may also utilize spontaneous antibiotic resistant mutants [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Spontaneous mutations, selectable markers, laboratory manipulations, and passage of isolates potentially alter the fitness of bacteria [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. In addition, while protocols have been adapted to transform unencapsulated and laboratory pneumococcal strains, many clinical isolates are difficult to transform. Pozzi et al. show that only 48% of the encapsulated strains were transformable, although all 42 encapsulated strains they tested carried competence genes [43]. Therefore, a second goal was to develop a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to compare the virulence potential of two strains by targeting innate genetic differences between strains. This assay allows for direct comparison of low passage, unmodified isolates and circumvents the need for inserting selectable markers.",

Strains used in this work were low passage carriage isolates selected from our S. pneumoniae collection. Strain FG23 is part of a collection of samples taken from healthy children in a prospective study of pneumococcal carriage among PCV7 recipients in Texas between 2000 and 2001 [29]. Strain MIB02102 is from a collection of samples isolated from healthy children in a study of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae colonization, and risk factors for carriage in children less than 3 years of age in Michigan [44]. Both strains belong to ST199. Strain FG23 is serotype 19A and strain MIB02102 is serotype 15B/C. While some studies consider 15B and 15C separately [45], [46], the coding regions for serotypes 15B and 15C differ only by a single TA tandem repeat [47], which results in a single difference in the O-acetyl structure [28], [47], [48], [49]. As serotypes 15B and 15C can interconvert, we consider 15B and 15C together in our analyses as is done in other studies [28], [31], [50].

Strains were grown as monocultures and mixed in a 1:1 ratio just prior to inoculating the nares of healthy chinchillas. Nasopharyngeal washes were collected from all chinchillas on days 1 and 5 before barotrauma. Barotrauma was then performed to create negative pressure in the middle ear cavity and enhance development of experimental OM by aspirating up to 250 \u03bcl of air with a 25-gauge needle from the middle ear through the bullar bone. Tympanometry was used to confirm development of negative pressure in the middle ear space. Chinchillas were monitored closely for development of experimental OM by otomicroscopy and tympanometry. Once a chinchilla presented with symptoms of experimental OM infection, the middle ear cavity was opened. Both middle ear and nasopharyngeal lavage samples were collected at this time. Microbial DNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal lavages and middle ear cavity samples as described above. The qPCR assay was performed on the genomic DNA extracted from the samples to determine which strain was more robust in colonizing the nasopharynx and/or establishing infection in the middle ear space. Total viable counts were completed by plating on blood agar overnight and compared with total bacterial loads determined by qPCR. Relative error percents were calculated by comparing viable count and qPCR data for each chinchilla at each time point and tissue source (nasopharyngeal lavage or middle ear sample). In addition, serotyping by Quellung reaction was also completed [53] by plating on blood agar overnight and determining serotype for a small sample of colonies from each chinchilla to confirm that the qPCR assay was detecting the correct serotype in the chinchilla model samples. The experimental OM co-culture inoculum experiment was completed three times with 6, 6, and 4 chinchillas, respectively.",

Shouval et al. reported a slight increase in the odds of finding serotype 19A in disease compared to carriage (versus no different than 1.0 in serotype 15B/C) [9]. Epidemiological data suggest that serogroup 15 strains are increasing in carriage and disease [21], [23], [24], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [59]. Between 2001 and 2007, Huang et al. observed a statistically significant increase in 19A colonization and a 50% increase, though not significant, in 15B/C colonization [31]. Casey et al. recovered both serotypes 19A and 15B/C from the middle ear space of children with and without acute OM [59], [60]. The most common serotypes recovered were 19A, 11, 15, and 23B from non-acute OM visits and 19A, 15, and 6C from acute OM visit [59]. Hicks et al. found statistically significant increases in the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease due to 19A and 15 in young children and older adults after the introduction of PCV7 in the United States [32]. Gonzalez et al. reported a significant increase in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by serogroup 15, with ST199 being the predominant clone [28].",

In the experimental OM model, we show that FG23, which expresses a 19A capsule, does not have a significant advantage over a serotype 15B/C strain, MIB02102, in its ability to colonize or cause disease. This is consistent with observations that 19A and 15B/C are two of the most prevalent serotypes found in the nasopharynx of children [31]. As serotype 19A isolates are recovered more frequently than serotype 15B/C from children with invasive pneumococcal disease, yet colonization appears similar, tissue-specific genetic requirements beyond capsule are potentially responsible for differences in colonization, mucosal infection, and bloodstream invasion.",

These authors postulate that there is a greater metabolic cost to produce capsule in serotypes with more carbons and high-energy bonds per polysaccharide repeat unit. Thus, serotypes with low production costs are increasing in prevalence because they can produce more polysaccharide capsule and are consequently better able to evade neutrophil-mediated killing. Data indicate that serotype 15B/C has more carbons and high-energy bonds per repeat unit than serotype 19A [61]. The shorter generation time of FG2319A over MIB0210215B/C found here supports this \u201ccost of capsule\u201d model. Serotype 19A has 7 high energy bonds and 20 carbons, whereas serotype 15B/C has 11.4 high energy bonds and 15B and 15C have 33.4 and 32 carbons, respectively. Weinberger et al. did not directly examine the degree of encapsulation and neutrophil-mediated killing of serotype 15 strains [61]. Based on their results, we would also expect that FG2319A would persist longer in carriage and would be a better competitor in the disease model because it can produce more capsule for the same energy cost and thus should be able to evade destruction by the immune system. However, our chinchilla model did not identify significant differences between the two serotypes when inoculated in monoculture or in co-culture. Although a small number of animals were studied for duration of colonization, we utilized a non-parametric test appropriate for the small number and expect any differences in duration of colonization would be slight.",

Other factors contribute to virulence in disease models and in patients with pneumococcal disease, including pneumococcal genetic background, doubling time, pathogenicity islands, prevalence in the population, and host factors [62], [63], [64], [65]. There is evidence that genetic background, beyond clonal complex and serotype, influence pneumococcal disease potential [10], [65], [66]\nS. pneumoniae is a highly plastic species with a high level of genetic diversity. Accessory genes exist within the pneumococcal supragenome, which may cluster into regions [66]. Accessory regions vary not only between, but also within clonal types. These accessory regions may also encode redundant functions, i.e. phosphotransferase sugar transport systems and ATP-binding cassette transport systems [66]. This redundancy suggests that a single gene or gene profile will not necessarily identify strains that are more or less pathogenic. A more complete understanding of the pneumococcal supragenome, including accessory regions, serotype, and clonal complex, when combined with epidemiological and clinical data will help elucidate disease potential.",

An advantage to this model is that it allows nasopharyngeal colonization to be established before infection, further improving upon previous chinchilla models of experimental OM which used direct middle ear inoculation [12], [15]. Following colonization, barotrauma created negative pressure in the middle ear cavity, allowing bacteria into the middle ear space and leading to infection. Eustachian tube dysfunction in humans is often cause by a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Influenza, RSV, coronavirus, and adenovirus are associated with otitis media [67] but may differentially impact Eustachian tube function [68], [69], [70]. Rather than choosing one particular virus, we used barotrauma to create the negative pressure, which enabled us to reproduce the Eustachian tube dysfunction in a consistent, simplified manner. Day of barotrauma may affect the outcome of experimental OM. In the literature challenge to the middle ear via barotrauma or bacterial inoculation varies from 48 h to 7 days [15], [71], [72]. We selected day 5 for barotrauma to allow bacterial colonization to be established before infection and also to reflect peak incidence of acute OM following upper respiratory tract infection in children which occurs on days 3 and 5 [73].",

Generally, competition studies rely on spontaneous mutations or selectable markers in laboratory-altered strains for differentiation. However, these markers may introduce artificial fitness costs not found in the parent strain [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [74]. By using viable count data and Quellung reaction serotyping data, we showed the qPCR assay is selectively and accurately amplifying the S. pneumoniae strains in monoculture, and in mixed cultures in vitro and in the chinchilla model of disease. To our knowledge, this is the first qPCR assay to take advantage of innate genetic divergences for differentiation between strains of the same species in order to measure in vitro growth characteristics and in vivo capacity. Traditionally, serotype assignment is completed on a limited number of colony forming units. Serotyping several hundred colonies per sample per animal is inefficient, costly, and impractical. The qPCR assay uses the larger sample and provides definitive, quantitative results. The ability to assess capacity to colonize and to cause experimental OM in the disease model will assist in the search for virulence factors in S. pneumoniae strains. In addition, the assay may be adapted for use with other bacterial species.",

            "text": "As with any assay, there are limitations to our method for assessing growth characteristics and infection potential. If the bacterial load in the chinchilla model is low, there is a limit of detection in qPCR. Also, it is possible to overload the qPCR with too much template [75]. The simplest solutions are to decrease the volume of template added or to dilute the template. We found a 5-fold dilution was sufficient when saturation was a problem. qPCR does not provide a method for differentiating between metabolically active and inactive bacteria. We cannot definitely state whether the viable count data are yielding 100% of the live bacteria present in the sample or whether the qPCR assay is overestimating absolute bacterial counts by detecting DNA from dead bacteria. Conversely, researchers have demonstrated the presence of viable bacteria in culture-negative middle ear samples [76], [77]. Therefore, the assay provides a culture-independent method, which may be more accurate than culture methods. Post et al. have shown that after 3 days, DNA from dead bacteria in the chinchilla middle ear is no longer amplifiable [77]. In addition, the qPCR analyses are dependent upon plasmid-based standard curve copy number calculations, which could contribute to either underestimation or overestimation of viable count. In this project, data from viable count and qPCR analyses were comparable. These limitations regarding detection of viable bacteria must be taken into consideration when evaluating absolute viable counts. This may be less of a problem here, when comparing strain relative ratios.",

Shouval et al. describe that the likelihood of finding serotype 15B/C strains in invasive disease or acute OM following colonization is equal to finding it in carriage [9]. Therefore, as the prevalence of 15B/C carriage increases, serotype 15B/C strains may become responsible for more disease. Continually adding serotypes to the current vaccines is not a sustainable approach to prevention and control of pneumococcal disease. As both serotypes 15B/C and 19A were demonstrated to be virulent in our experimental OM model, further evaluation of non-vaccine serotypes to determine their capacity to colonize and produce acute OM is needed to understand the potential impact of next generation capsular vaccines. Further research is needed to identify other non-capsule virulence factors and to develop alternative strategies for prevention and control.",
