A logistic regression model revealed that sex and age were both significantly related to the case fatality rate. However, the analysis also showed that the gender difference could not be explained by a significantly higher age distribution among the males compared with the females. Regarding the age of SARS cases, all females were significantly younger than males, which is explained by the relatively high number of infected hospital staff (22 percent) among all SARS patients, especially nurses (5); 60 percent of all infected health care workers (n = 384) were females less than age 45 years (5) . However, this \"selected\" health care patient population is unlikely to have biased the gender difference observed in the mortality rate, since the vast majority, or 85.3 percent, of the deaths occurred among patients over 44 years of age, and subgroup analysis excluding all health care workers showed a significant sex difference in the mortality rate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This observation may indicate that males are more severely affected than females by the SARS coronavirus (8) . Our results show that the SARS mortality gender difference was highest for younger patients (0-44 years of age), with a relative risk of about 2 (also after excluding health care workers from the analysis). This gender difference was also observed for patients aged 45-74 years (relative risk = 1.45) but not for elderly patients, those aged 75 years or older. The diminishing gender-specific SARS mortality rate with increasing age may be due to the generally age-dependent trend of the health of a population, that is, that age becomes much more important than any possible gender difference. This possibility is suggested by the fact that the overall SARS mortality rates were 4.3 percent, 25.7 percent, and 64.2 percent for the three age groups, respectively. However, the exact mechanism regarding how the SARS coronavirus infects and manifests itself in humans has yet to be elucidated. Before making any wider interpretation, we would be interested to see whether our findings are confirmed from data collected in other regions with a high SARS prevalence.
