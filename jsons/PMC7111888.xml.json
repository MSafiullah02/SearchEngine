The disease disseminated very rapidly in different counties causing considerable economical loss. Affected rabbits aged 5\u20137 weeks manifested apathy, depression, decreased feed intake, abdominal bloating, limited watery diarrhoea sometimes with mucus, dehydration, and death. The disease was characterized as sub-acute mucoid enteropathy with unusual high rates of mortality. Death rates during the fattening period varied from 16.7% to 35.2% depending on the time of the year, type of commercial diet, preventive antibiotherapy strategy, animal density, and hygienic conditions (Rodr\u00edguez-De Lara, 2003). The disease was highly transmissible and presumptive immunosupprression was suggested. Some other field studies on the characterization and lesions observed in rabbits showing severe cases of diarrhoeas in Mexico have been published (Salcedo-Baca et al., 2004, Ventura et al., 2004). In a recent report study, Beltz et al. (2005) found, in different segments of the small intestine, a sub-acute lymphocytic\u2013plasmocytic enteritis with atrophy and fusion of villi and globet cells hyperplasia.",

            "text": "Diarrhoeas in rabbits represent an important factor influencing profitable rabbit production. The aetiology of mucoid enteritis is unknown and has been referred as mucoid enteritis complex because causes are often multiple (Whitney, 1976). However, in true cases of mucoid enteritis, visible inflammation of the intestine was not observed, and instead was designated mucoid enteropathy (ME) complex (Flatt et al., 1974). Symptoms of ME consist of depression, anorexia, abdominal bloating, diarrhoea, mucus in faeces, hypothermia, and dehydration. At necropsy the stomach and small intestines are dilated, thickened, and filled with translucent mucoid fluid. The caecum appears impacted and the sacculated portion of the colon presents clear gelatinous mucus. Hyperplasia of globet cells throughout the small intestine is a feature (Van Kruiningen and Williams, 1972). Lesions in the caecum were minimal to absent (Whitney, 1976). Mucoid enteropathy has been related to gut dysfunction or due to direct pathogenic agents. A wrong feed formulation, season, excessive antibiotics administration, stressors, loss of passive immunity, cold, and early weaning induce changes in the gastrointestinal motility and in pH conditions resulting in abnormal caecal fermentation and proliferation of pathogens agents which co-existing at the same time caused diarrhoeas (Laplace, 1978, Lelkes and Chang, 1987).",

            "text": "In commercial rabbits, the involvement of highly pathogenic agents acting synergistically with moderate endemic pathogens results in multifactorial enteropathy difficult to diagnose and treat (Boucher and Nouaille, 1996). Bacterial enteritis can be caused by infection with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Clostridium piliformis (causative of Tyzzer\u2019s disease), Clostridium spiriforme (causative of iota-toxin enterotoxemia), Salmonella spp., Kleibsella, Pseudomonas, and Campylobacter-like species among others (Peeters, 1987, Licois, 1989, Boucher and Nouaille, 1996, Marlier et al., 2003a). Parasitic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract of the rabbit involve infection with Eimeria spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Passalurus ambiguus, Passalurus nonanulatus, Obeliscoides cuniculi, and a variety of cestodes and trematodes (Brooks, 1983, Marlier et al., 2003a). However, intestinal coccidiosis are the most frequent parasites isolated when diarrhea occurs and have been closely associated with ME complex (Peeters, 1987, Licois, 1989, Marlier et al., 2003a). The severity of coccidiosis has been related to the species involved and to the level of infection. According to Peeters (1988), intestinal species include those with high pathogenicity (E. intestinalis, E. piriformis, and E. flavescencs), moderate pathogenicity (E. magna, E. media) and low pathogenicity (E. perforans, E. irresidua, and E. coecicola). While different studies related to the participation of virus in episodes of mucoid enteritis-complex in rabbits also exist, rotavirus are the most commonly virus detected in cases of diarrhoeas in weanling rabbits (Schoeb et al., 1986, Peeters, 1987, Licois, 1989, Marlier et al., 2003a). Experimental infection with adenovirus, parvovirus, and coronavirus could cause very mild symptoms and moderate enteritis in the small intestines (Bodon and Prohaszka, 1980, Matsunaga and Chino, 1981, Descoteaux et al., 1985). The co-existence of different enteric pathogen agents causes severe destruction of the mucosal integrity resulting in anorexia, diarrhoea, dehydration, polidypsia, and death (Wilber, 1999, Nieddu et al., 2000).",

The ERE has been described as a digestive syndrome associated with high mortality and rapid spread affecting mainly young fattening rabbits. It is characterized by depression, decreased feed intake, abdominal distension, limited diarrhoea, and sometimes discharge of mucus (Licois, 1998, Licois et al., 2000). Gross lesions include the stomach and intestines which are distended due to the presence of abundant gas and fluid. At necropsy, rabbits with ERE are absent of any inflammatory or congestive lesions but show signs associated with caecal paresis and the presence of variable amounts of gelatinous mucus particularly in the colon and sometimes in the small intestine. Epithelial lesions of the small intestine are particularly marked towards the ileum and characterized by a proliferation of glands, prominent generalized atrophy of villi, and features of epithelial degeneration and necrosis which are most often slight and disseminated. Epithelial lesions in the large intestine are degenerative and slight. A congestion and villus atrophy of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum with a diffuse mucosal lymphoid infiltrate in rabbits affected by a naturally occurring ERE have been reported (Vandekerchove et al., 2000).",

Nieddu et al. (2000) in Italy detected viral particles by negative staining electron microscopy from rabbits with enterotyphylitis, which varied from catarrhal to catarrhal-haemorrhagic and in some cases to necrotic-haemorrhagic lesions. The presence of at least one type of viral particle was detected in 37.3% of faecal material of deceased rabbits presenting digestive pathology. Viral particles similar to rotavirus (41.9%), coronavirus (25.6%), parvovirus (21.1%), and enterovirus-like virus (10.3%) were found. In most cases, multiple infections with rotavirus-like particle, coronavirus, and parvovirus were mainly involved. Legall et al. (1998) supported the hypothesis of viral infection as the main cause of ERE. In a recent study, Licois et al. (2005) demonstrated that the intestinal content from ERE-rabbits was infectious as early as the second day, but the aetiological agent was not identified.",

However, until the present study, the aetiological factors causative of the disease have not been defined. One of the most relevant differences between the old description of ME and the mucoid enteropathy reported in the present case is that the former acts as sporadic disease whereas, in the later, epizootic outbreaks with persistent and recurrent characteristics were manifested. The pathological changes are compatible with an enteropathy, but are not pathognomonic. Intestinal lesions were variable and appear to be non-specific but, in addition with the inflammatory infiltrate in the small intestine, suggest a viral infection; probably complicated with the presence of other enteric pathogens such as bacteria agents in rabbits. The fiber content of the pelleted diet was adequate. Rodr\u00edguez-De Lara (2003) observed that diet was not the main factor causing diarrhoeas in Mexico but acted as a predisposing factor when fiber content was inadequate. A low-fiber diet results in caecal-colonic hypomotility leading to constipation and diarrhoea (Laplace, 1978). Constipation is the result of disruption of the microflora of the rabbit gastrointestinal tract due to abnormal fermentations and proliferation of pathogen agents (Lelkes and Chang, 1987). The accumulation of mucus in the colon has been explained in terms of impaction, as the result of obstruction of transit due to intestinal stasis (Sinkovics, 1976) and this lesion has been experimentally induced by caecal ligation (Hotchkiss and Merrit, 1996). The direct action of pathogen agents constitutes other cause of hypersecretion of mucus in the colon of rabbits (Licois, 2002).",

On the bacterial culturing, E. coli was isolated in abundant numbers in the faeces of two rabbits and traces in the other but the role of this bacteria is not clear especially when considering that E. coli are normal inhabitants of the gut and tests to determine pathogenic sub-types were not performed. Further steps will be taken to isolate and identified the biotype involved in rabbits with diarrhoea in Mexico to determine if sub-type involved is pathogenic.",

Salcedo-Baca et al. (2004) reported the presence of E. coli, Clostridium spp., Salmonella spp., Pasteurella spp., Glutaratus spp., Saccharomyces spp., and Eimeria spp. in a rabbit unit in Mexico affected with persistent severe cases of diarrhoeas for many years. The heterogeneity of pathogen agents found in different cases of epizootic outbreak of diarrhoeas in different rabbit farms in Mexico might be explained in terms of differences on the type of commercial diet used, animal density, husbandry, and hygienic conditions.",

Although tests to differentiate species were not carried out, our findings suggest that moderate to highly pathogenic species affecting the gastrointestinal tract might have a role in this finding, probably acting as complicating factor in the aetiology of diarrhoeas. However, this needs to be confirmed. The isolation of coccidias in cases of mucoid enteropathy have shown to be high (Peeters, 1987, Licois, 1989, Marlier et al., 2003a). Intestinal coccidiosis causes villous atrophy (Peeters et al., 1984) and reduces intestinal peristalsis (Fioramonti et al., 1981). According to Licois (2002), coccidiosis is responsible for digestive lesions similar to sub-acute atrophyant, erosive, and regenerative enteritis. Coccidian acting synergistically with other agents such as EPEC, Clostridium spp., and rotavirus cause diarrhoeas, high mortality, growth depression, and unfavourable feed conversion (Peeters, 1987, Nieddu et al., 2000).",

Rotaviruses were detected in stool samples of rabbits showing epizootic outbreaks of diarrhoeas in Mexico (Salcedo-Baca et al., 2004, Beltz et al., 2005). In the present study, we were unable to detect rotaviruses. Nevertheless, a negative result does not exclude the possibility of rotavirus infection, especially if considering that rotaviruses are regarded as the most frequent detected virus in rabbits with diarrhoeas (Schoeb et al., 1986, Peeters, 1987, Licois, 1989, Nieddu et al., 2000, Marlier et al., 2003a) and that atrophy and fusion of villous in the present case correspond well with typical lesions caused by this virus (Thouless et al., 1988). Rotavirus, when introduced into colonies not previously exposed and with low immunity, results in a rapid onset and high mortality (Schoeb et al., 1986). However, rotaviruses as the main cause of the epizootic outbreaks of diarrhoeas in Mexico is questionable, particularly if considering that rotavirus are considered endemic and mildly pathogenic in commercial rabbitries (Peeters et al., 1984, Thouless et al., 1988). Despite this, rotaviruses could cause high death ratios when other viral infections and secondary pathogens like EPEC are involved (Thouless et al., 1996).",

There are several reports that have pointed out the participation of virus in outbreaks in mucoid enteritis and rabbit enteropathies (Nieddu et al., 2000). Ultrastructurally in our case, the most striking changes were the hyperplasia of globet cells, random apoptosis and intranuclear and intracytoplasmic virus-like particles. Nevertheless, the morphology, size, and features of them were different from viruses described in the literature, associated with enteropathies in rabbits (Cheville, 1994, Murphy et al., 1999). The arrangement of the intranuclear components (heterochromatin, euchromatin, and nucleoli), as well as the integrity of the different organelles in the cytoplasm, suggest that there was absence or mild viral replication because otherwise there would have been a strong effect in nuclei and cytoplasm (Cheville, 1994, Murphy et al., 1999). Therefore, in our cases, it is strongly suggestive that the virus-like particles were in a latent stage or that they had finished their replication, when samples were taken.",

            "text": "A significant reduction in the proportion of serum gamma-globulins was observed in rabbits who survive to an outbreak of diarrhoeas (8.1%) when compared with free-disease healthy control rabbits (14%). The proportion of gamma-globulins assessed in surviving rabbits was shown to be below the 10% to 12% range values reported by Vaissaire et al. (1978) in 1\u201324 months old healthy rabbits. Results indicate persistently low gamma-globulins values for affected rabbits of 8, 9, and 10 weeks of age as compared with the healthy disease free rabbits. Mean values in the two groups increased as the age of the rabbit increased. The low levels of gamma-globulins in rabbits who survive an outbreak of diarrhoeas suggest defective host defences that are probably the result of a chronic disease, but the mechanism involved is unknown. For the high levels of mortality observed during the acute phase of the disease it is possible that low levels of gamma-globulins may also have occurred during this period however, this was not determined. The depletion of lymphocytes observed in the spleen of all rabbits during the acute phase of the disease in the histopathology study may be related with hypogammaglobulinemia that is probably due to a reduction in the number of T and B cells involved in the cellular and humoral immune response. However, a final conclusion cannot be drawn because functional analysis of the cells involved was not performed. Whether hypogammaglobulinemia was due to impaired B-cell antibody functions induced by virus is unknown, but intriguing since transient or more long-lasting generalized immune suppression has been documented with numerous viruses (Borrow et al., 1995). The 100% survival of rabbits manifesting low levels of gamma-globulins may be the result of low animal density encountered in the herd when the experiments were performed. This probably was accompanied by a substantial reduction in microbial contamination in the surrounding environment resulting in less risk of infection by other secondary opportunistic pathogen agents. Experimental evidence showed that when five rabbits who survived to an outbreak were allocated in the same cage under high animal density herd conditions, many of these rabbits died later during the late fattening period mainly due to digestive or respiratory disorders (Rodr\u00edguez-De Lara, 2003).",

Apparently, horizontal transmission likely occurs through air-born particles, contact with contaminated surfaces, rabbits, excreta, urine, and probably through consumption of contaminated food. A temporary stop on the breeding programme in the maternity unit, depopulation of the fattening unit for 3 months and deep cleaning and disinfection was not a solution for eradicating the disease (Rodr\u00edguez-De Lara, 2003). As soon as the fattening unit was occupied, the disease recurred, suggesting that breeding stock may act as a asymptomatic carrier of hypothetical virus. Vertical transmission through the placenta and doe\u2019s milk may probably also occur, but this requires further investigation.",

Interstitial pneumonia in rabbits affected with ERE in Europe have been reported and are probably associated with viral infection (Licois, 1998). However, Licois et al.

To ascertain for sure whether the disease present in Mexico is the same as that described in Europe opens an intriguing and challenging field of research, especially if we consider that in Europe efforts to find the virus pathogen as the main cause of ERE, responsible have not been conclusive (Legall et al., 1998, Licois et al., 2000, Licois et al., 2005).",
