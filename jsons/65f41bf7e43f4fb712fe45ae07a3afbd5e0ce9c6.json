In this case study the test for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in pharyngeal swab and anal swab were compared. Case presentation: A 3-month-old girl was admitted to our hospital with COVID-19. Her parents had both been diagnosed with COVID-19. The results of pharyngeal swab and anal swab of the little girl were recorded and compared during the course of the disease. The oropharyngeal specimen showed negative result for SARS-CoV-2 on the 14th day after onset of the illness. However, the anal swab was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the 28th day after the onset of the illness. Conclusion: The possibility of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 should be assessed. Personal hygiene during home quarantine merits considerable attention.",

The girl had a history of good physical health with no underlying diseases, but she had returned to Jingzhou (Hubei province of China) from Wuhan with her parents 10 days before. Of note, her parents had been diagnosed with COVID-19 using real-time RT-PCR for the viral RNA from oropharyngeal specimens two days earlier. Physical examination of the girl revealed fever (38.2 \u00b0C), and laboratory examination revealed high neutrophil levels (86.2%) and reduced lymphocytes (7.1%). On January 31, 2020, the oropharyngeal swabs of the patient were positive for SARS-CoV-2. A chest CT indicated no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities. On the 2nd day after admission, her temperature returned to normal. On the 4th day, diarrhea completely recovered. The oropharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 on the 14th day after onset of the illness. However, the anal swabs remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the 28th day after the onset of the illness (Table 1) . The infant has been discharged on March 1 and is in good condition now.",

            "text": "diSCUSSion Several different receptors have been shown to bind to different types of coronaviruses. These include the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV. Lu et al 11 showed that the structure of the receptorbinding domains between SARS-CoV and the novel SARS-CoV-2 was similar using molecular modeling, indicating that ACE2 might also be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, although amino acids in the receptorbinding domain of SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of SARS-CoV. The abundant presence of ACE2 in the epithelia of the lung and intestine is widely acknowledged, and this ACE2 might be part of one route of COVID-19 transmission. Previous studies have proved the presence of viral nucleic acids in fecal samples and anal swabs of patients with COVID-19, but the implications of this require further investigation. 12 The possibility of fecal-oral transmission in SARS-CoV-2 infection should be taken into consideration. More attention should be paid to the hand hygiene and disinfection of patients' vomitus, feces, and other excretions.",

Current discharge standards are as follows: The patient's body temperature must remain normal for over 3 days; respiratory symptoms must be significantly relieved; lung inflammation must show obvious signs of absorption; and tests for viral nucleic acid must be negative for two consecutive times, sampled at least one day apart. 12 If we had not tested this anal swab, the patient might have been discharged from the hospital half a month ago. Given that the patient was 3 months old, her caregivers were likely to be exposed to feces or other body fluids containing the virus. We conclude that when discharged patients are isolated at home, their family members should pay very close attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing a toilet with patients wherever possible. In households without a separate toilet, patients can be isolated and the rest room must be disinfected using 75% ethanol, chlorine containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, or other fat solvents after each use.",
