For many nations this will add to an existing baseline of psychological pathology 3 and low morale in the healthcare sector. Supporting the mental health of these individuals is a critical part of the public health response. The scope of the paper is to address some of the organisational, team and individual considerations for supporting staff (pragmatically) during this pandemic. The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we cover how staff may experience stress during a pandemic and in sections 3 to 5 we cover what organisations, teams and individuals can do to help, before concluding in section 6.",

They include emotional, cognitive, physical and social reactions and will usually present in combination. It is important that staff are aware of these reactions and that it is normal to experience them, because distress arises from feeling guilt or shame about these reactions happening. See Table 2 which shows symptoms of acute stress reactions. 16, 17 Moral injury Moral injury is present when there is a betrayal of what is right, either by the self or by someone in legitimate authority, in a high stakes situation. 18 While the pandemic we are currently dealing with is a sort of natural disaster, the reactions of those 'in legitimate authority' will be perceived by many as 'a betrayal of what is right'. Many of those aware of this and affected by it are in healthcare and adjacent fields. It is clear that even in the most perfect of scenarios, this pandemic would have overwhelmed existing resources because of the number of patients requiring intubation and intensive care, but it is also true that more could have been done in the time available to prepare. At an individual level, clinical decisions will have to be made which contravene the morals of those making them. 12 1. Not upset at all (some distress but recover with the support of family members, friends or others) 2. Proportionately distressed, but able to function in the short and medium term (not mentally disordered) 3. Disproportionately distressed or distressed and dysfunctional in the short to medium term (may recover relatively quickly if given appropriate assistance as well as those who may develop mental disorders; therefore, people in this group require a thorough assessment) 4. Mentally disordered in the short, medium or longer term (require specialist assessment followed by timely and effective mental healthcare) Adapted from: Williams et al. 12 For example, choosing which patients will not receive life support if there are resource scarcities. These decisions will be supported by protocol, but they differ from usual practice and guidelines pre-COVID-19. Already staff report being worried about having to make these decisions, having seen the experience of their colleagues in other countries, and they are experiencing anticipatory guilt 19 while they wait for the peak to hit in their own countries. It will be essential for leaders at all levels to remind staff that they are not making decisions alone, that there is protocol, and also to recognise that these decisions go against the grain for many. It will be necessary to offer ongoing support to all staff, whether that is a local Schwartz round 20 type gathering or something similar, in order for these experiences to be processed for some time after the most difficult phase of this pandemic has passed.",

Resources have traditionally been put towards supporting staff once they have developed mental health pathology, for example rapid access to counselling, psychiatry and contingency for time off work. However, a shift of focus is needed from the individual to the organisation. Prevention and mitigation is far more important than cure. 24 Organisations should immediately reflect on the challenges that staff faced at a baseline before the addition of the pandemic. Shift working, night shifts, overstaying breaks and shift ends, workload, 'corridor medicine' are all significant factors influencing wellbeing. [24] [25] [26] Recognition of these factors and how the pandemic will influence them is important. The pandemic will also probably cause changes to other factors that affect wellbeing such as the structure of the organisation, roles of staff, autonomy and availability of senior support. Research has shown that individuals benefit from tangible and practical support. 5 Organisations are able support staff in many ways (see Table 3 ). 15, 24, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] Organisational provision of psychological support Drop-in sessions with psychologists/psychiatrists have been recommended based on evidence from previous outbreaks. 5 The availability of support from psychologists and psychiatrists will vary from hospital to hospital and is likely to be scarce. An example of learning from a Toronto hospital in the SARS outbreak was that psychological drop-in sessions were more effective when they were offered in comfortable surroundings 5 such as a room with sofas and music, and where senior staff also used the drop-ins. Remote psychological support such as phone, Skype etc. is indicated especially when the goal is having as few people on site and exposed to infection as possible. While peer support has its place, sometimes being able to offload to a relative stranger can be useful to staff, especially in order to acknowledge feelings they are struggling with such as fear, anger and a reluctance to come to work at all.",

When supporting staff, both those in quarantine/isolation at home or during 'work isolation' (where staff must work on infected wards, but isolate at home outside of work), it is important to remember that both psychological support related to the primary stressor (dealing with the pandemic at work) as well as support to mitigate secondary stressors (related to the basic needs of life such as childcare, grocery shopping and other basic life activities) are needed. 31 The return to work phase should be particularly carefully handled because even brief stints away from work, such as a day off, have been shown to have quite a profound effect 4 and staff have felt unsure about what they would be returning to.
