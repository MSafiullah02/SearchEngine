Fifteen species of enterovirus are known, 7 of which are known to infect humans. These species include enterovirus A-D and rhinovirus A-C (1,2). The newly emerging genotype C105 (EV-C105) represents a novel monophyletic clade of enterovirus C; this strain was identified in 2010 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (strain 34S) (3, 4) . EV-C105 cases from Italy (Pavia/8376, Pavia/9095), Romania (ROM31), the United States (USA/OK/2014-19362), New Zealand (strains not available), and Burundi (BU77, BU5) have been identified and characterized, suggesting that the spread of EV-C105 could be wider than previously hypothesized (5) . Here, we report a detected case of EV-C105 in an 11-year-old girl with lower respiratory tract symptoms in Beijing, China.",

To study enterovirus infections, we tested 24,093 clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, and alveolar lavage fluid) from patients with RTIs that were reported through RVSS during June 2014-December 2017. RVSS classifies persons <14 years of age as children and those >14 years of age as adults. The ages of the reported patients ranged from 8 months to 93 years (median 33.5 years, mean 37.9 years).",

Blood tests in the clinic showed total leukocyte count 1.41 \u00d7 10 10 cells/L; neutrophils, 79.2%; lymphocytes, 12.1%; total platelet count, 5.2 \u00d7 10 11 /L; and hemoglobin, 130 g/L. Chest radiographs showed thickness or turbulence in the texture in both lungs, which was diagnosed as pneumonia. She received supportive treatment and received antimicrobial drugs empirically before being sent home the same day. She was not hospitalized during her illness. According to a follow-up survey, she recovered 14 days later. We detected no other respiratory pathogens in this patient.",

In this study, we grouped Beijing-R2759 with the strain obtained from the United States in 2014 (Figure) . We observed a similar relationship in the phylogenic tree of the VP1 gene.

During 2014-2018, we collected 1,135 samples from salamanders and newts in 6 countries in Europe. We identified 5 cases of B. salamandrivorans in a wild population in Spain but none in central Europe or the Balkan Peninsula.C hytridiomycosis, an amphibian disease caused by the chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans, is responsible for declines of amphibian populations worldwide (1). The recently discovered B. salamandrivorans (2) is severely impacting salamanders and newts in Europe (3, 4) . This emerging fungal pathogen infects the skin of caudates and causes lethal lesions (2) . It most likely was introduced to Europe by the pet salamander trade from Southeast Asia (3). In Europe, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany have confirmed B. salamandrivorans in wild caudates; the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain have confirmed the fungus in captive animals (5, 6) . Several countries have established trade regulations (5) and a recent European Union decision, no. 2018/320, implements measures to protect against the spread of B. salamandrivorans via traded salamanders (7) . The World Organisation for Animal Health listed infection with B. salamandrivorans as a notifiable disease in 2017. In addition to controlling the amphibian pet trade, surveillance of the pathogen is urgently needed to establish disease intervention strategies in affected areas and prevention in B. salamandrivorans-free regions.During 2014-2018, we collected 1,135 samples directly for the detection of B. salamandrivorans or as a part of unrelated studies. Samples came from 10 amphibian species at 47 sites in 6 countries in Europe. Most samples came from the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, which is a known suitable host for B. salamandrivorans (3) , and the palmate newt, Lissotriton helveticus, which is known to be resistant to B. salamandrivorans (Appendix Table 1 , http://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/25/7/18-1001-App1.pdf).Most samples were skin swabs collected by following the standard procedure for sampling of amphibian chytrid fungi (8) . A smaller portion of samples was toe clippings (Appendix Table 2 ). We extracted genomic DNA following the protocol of Blooi et al. (9) , and 2 laboratories with different equipment tested for B. salamandrivorans. Samples from Spain and the Czech Republic initially were analyzed at the Czech University of Life Sciences (Prague, Czech",
