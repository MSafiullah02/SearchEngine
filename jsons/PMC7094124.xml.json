            "text": "Developments of sequencing technologies cause the number of biological sequences increasing exponentially in databases. However, it is difficult to obtain information directly from the primary sequences. Then mathematical analysis of the large volume of sequences data becomes one of the challenges for bio-scientists. Using graphical approaches to study biological problems can provide intuitive picture or useful insights for helping analyzing complicated relations in these systems, as demonstrated by many previous studies on a series of important biological topics, such as enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Andraos, 2008; Chou, 1981, Chou, 1989; Chou and Forsen, 1980; Chou and Liu, 1981; Myers and Palmer, 1985), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990), inhibition kinetics of processive nucleic acid polymerases and nucleases (Althaus et al., 1993a, Althaus et al., 1993b, Althaus et al., 1993c), analysis of codon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1993, Zhang and Chou, 1994), base frequencies in the antisense strands (Chou et al., 1996). Moreover, graphical methods have been introduced for QSAR study (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2006, Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2007b; Prado-Prado et al., 2008) and for dealing with complicated network systems (Diao et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2007a, Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2008). Recently, the images of cellular automata (Wolfram, 1984) were also used to represent biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a) for predicting protein structural classes (Xiao et al., 2008) and subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006b), identifying G-protein-coupled receptor functional classes (Xiao et al., 2009), investigating HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b) and HBV viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a), as well as visually analyzing SARS-CoV (Gao et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005). In this study, we attempted to propose a different 3D graphical representation for DNA sequences in hopes to provide a useful tool for the relevant areas.",

            "text": "Since Hamori and Ruskin (1983) first proposed a 3D graphical representation, some different graphical approaches have been reported for DNA sequences. Zhang and Zhang, 1991, Zhang and Zhang, 1994 create Z curve to represent DNA sequences in a 3D space. It demonstrates that Z curve does not lose any biological information of the sequence, because it especially uses the classifications of chemical structure on purines\u2013pyrimidines, amino\u2013keto groups and strong\u2013weak hydrogen bonds. Nandy (1994) proposes a 2D graphical representation by arbitrarily assigning A, G, T, and C to four directions of Cartesian coordinate axes, but such a representation of DNA is accompanied by some loss of visual information associated with crossing and overlapping of the resulting curve by itself. Randic et al. (2000) presents a 3-D graphical representation based on four mutually equivalent tetrahedral directions, which has an important advantage in that the assignment of the four bases to the four tetrahedral directions does not involve arbitrary decisions. Nevertheless, this model is also accompanied by the limitations associated with crossing and overlapping of the spatial curve representing a DNA sequence. Since 2000, researchers have outlined different representations of DNA sequences based on 2D (Guo et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Randic et al., 2003a, Randic et al., 2003b; Randic, 2004; Song and Tang, 2005; Yao et al., 2006), 3D (Cao et al., 2008; Liao and Wang, 2004a; Liao and Ding, 2006; Qi and Fan, 2007; Qi et al., 2007), 4D (Chi and Ding, 2005), 5D (Liao et al., 2007) and 6D (Liao and Wang, 2004b) spaces. However, some representations still cannot avoid loss of information due to overlapping and crossing of the curve with itself (Guo and Nandy, 2003; Wu et al., 2003; Nandy and Nandy, 2003). Moreover, some mathematical models are based on complex distance matrices and equations, their computations are so complicated, which may also ignore biology information hidden between the neighboring nucleotides (Liao and Wang, 2004c).",

Consideration of trinucleotides instead of individual and dual nucleotides has superior reasons and advantages. For example, the genetic code consists of trinucleotides of DNA and one can easily find the ORF as the longest sequence of trinucleotides that contains no stop codons when read in a single reading frame. Comparing with other models, TN curve is the first model that can display the information of trinuleotides within 3D space, which helps in visual inspections of sequence features such as composition and distribution of trinucleotides in DNA sequences, recognizing similarities/dissimilarities among different DNA sequences, and allows one to construct considerable numerical characterizations. With two vectors composed of 64 and 6 components, we outline two methods to compare similarities of different DNA sequences, respectively, which may provide convenient tools in sequences alignment.",

The curve connected all plots of the characteristic plot set in turn is called TN curve (curve based on trinucleotides). Thus, a given DNA sequence can be converted numerically into a 3D curve. In Table 2\n, we calculate corresponding (x,y,i) of the eight non-overlapping trinucleotides of sequence ATGGTGCACC. Fig. 2\nA shows the corresponding 3D representation. Obviously, the relation between every given DNA sequence with its TN curve is exactly one to one.Discussion 1According to the definition, x links the first and second bases of a trinucleotide, this can be used as an approximate descriptor of dinucleotide. If x>0, the second base of given trinucleotide must be A or T, otherwise G or C. Similar results can be obtained for y which links the second and third bases of a trinucleotide, y>0 represents that the second base is A or G, otherwise C or T. An intact trinucleotide is represented by integration of x and y. Therefore, one can obtain more information from these parameters. Letting xi\u2032=\u2211n=1ixn and yi\u2032=\u2211n=1iyn, we can obtain the cumulative effect of given sequence and inspect both the local and overall information of DNA sequence. Table 2 and Fig. 2B show the corresponding results based on (x\u2032, y\u2032,i).\nDiscussion 2Based on Fig. 1, the 64 kinds of trinucleotides can also be classified into two groups according to the quadrant in which the second base locates in three ways. That is, purine (A, G)/pyrimidine (C, T) groups correspond to quadrant (I, II)/(III, VI), amino (A, C)/keto (G, T) groups correspond to quadrant (I, III)/(II, VI), and week-H bond (A, T)/strong-H bond (G, C) groups correspond to quadrant (I, VI)/(II, III). According to Discussion 1, x>0 or x<0 mean that the second base of the trinucleotide must be an element of (A, T) or (G, C), which just correspond to week-H bond (A, T)/strong-H bond (G, C) groups. Similarly, y>0 or y<0 mean that the second base are (A, G) or (C, T), which just correspond to purine (A, G)/pyrimidine (C, T) groups. Supposing z=x\u2217y, when z>0, the second base of corresponding trinucleotide must be (A, C), or else (G, T), which just correspond to amino(A, C)/keto(G, T) groups. Thus, we have six descriptors x, y, x\u2032, y\u2032, z and z\u2032 to numerically represent a given DNA sequence, where, z=x\u2217y, zi\u2032=\u2211n=1izn.\nDiscussion 3From the construction of TN curve, we know that the initial assignments are not unique. According to statistics theory, we have, that is to say, various 3D curves for the same primary DNA sequence based on different assignments. Nevertheless, we can only obtain a unique primary DNA sequence by translating any TN curve to DNA sequence according to the designations in Fig. 1. Since the zigzag curve does not represent the genuine molecular geometry, we are not interested in the unique relationship between the initial assignments and the possible number of TN curve, but are interested in them as numerical parameters that may facilitate analysis of DNA sequences.\n",

Furthermore, the numbers of the line linking the trinucleotides can also display the corresponding trinucleotides usage frequency and correlations between neighboring trinuleotides, the more lines linked, the higher frequency occurring in the DNA sequence (the numbers of the lines observed may be less than practical situation because of overlapping). We can likewise find out whether specific trinucleotides, such as start and stop codons, consist in the DNA sequence directly. It is well known that any sequences have six possible reading frames. The specific codons such as start and stop codons only in a corresponding reading frame are significant. If we calculate the TN curves of each possible reading frame and repeat the steps of Fig. 3, it is conceivable that one can find out the ORF candidates easily.",

Nandy and his partners (2006) suggest that researchers should apply their graphical techniques to complete genes, or at least to the complete coding sequence, so that an unambiguous point of contact is available for comparing to the real world. In this section, we illustrate the utilities of TN curve with the examination of similarities analysis among the coding sequences of the first exon of \u03b2-globin gene of 11 species.

It is based on the quantitative characterization of DNA sequences by ordered sets of descriptors derived from the sequences, such as the normalized eigenvalues of all kinds of matrices. For example, Randic et al. (2003a) proposed E matrix, M/M matrix, L/L matrix and Lk/Lk matrix, then used their eigenvalues as descriptors. These methods were proved to be useful and used by many authors. However, these matrices become too large to calculate the eigenvalues when DNA sequence is very long, and the computations are very complex. Furthermore, there is some loss of information associated with these matrices (Liao and Wang, 2004c). Then, how to create a simple and convenient method has been a considerable challenge. Here, we propose two methods by constructing two kinds of vectors composed of different numerical descriptors, and both methods do not relate to complex calculations. The underlying assumption is that if two vectors point to a similar direction, two DNA sequences represented by the descriptor vectors are similar. Using Euclidean distance as measurement of sequence similarities, the smaller the Euclidean distance is, the more similar the DNA sequences are. That is to say, the distances between evolutionary closely related species are smaller, while those between evolutionary disparate species are larger.",

In order to find some of the invariants sensitive to the form of the TN curve, we use a vector relating to trinucleotides usages composed of 64 components as descriptors to represent DNA sequence. Here, we employ a symmetric matrix whose (i, j) is defined as the Euclidean distance between sequence i and j to describe the mutual distance of two sequences. Based on this vector, the Euclidean distance between two sequences can be defined as follows:D(Si,Sj)=\u2211m=164(PmSi-PmSj)2,where PmSi and PmSj are the usage probability of mth trinucleotide among the 64 kinds of trinucleotides in sequences Si and Sj, respectively. With the help of TN curve, one can get each kind of trinucleotide's usage probability in a given DNA sequence without complicated computation. In the sample of Table 2, it is easy to count the number of each trinucleotide easily. For example, we want to obtain the usage probability of trinucleotide GGT in a DNA sequence, which can be accomplished with the following formula:PGGT=N(-2,4)Ntot,where Ntot is the total number of all trinucleotides in given DNA sequence, N\n(\u22122, 4) denotes the number of GGT, which can be got by counting out these dots with x=\u22122 and y=4 from map \u03c6. In the sample of Table 2, the numbers of GGT is 1, the total number of all trinucleotides is 8, then the usage probability of trinucleotide GGT is 12.5%. Similarly, we can also compute the probabilities of other trinucleotides.",

Table 8, Table 9\nare the corresponding similarities matrices based on 6-components vector, respectively. Observing Table 6, we find gallus (the only non-mammal among them) and Opossum (the most remote species from the remaining mammals) are most dissimilar to others among the 11 species. On the other hand, human\u2013gorilla has the smallest distance, so they are the most similar species pairs. Human\u2013chimpanzee, goat\u2013bovine, mouse\u2013gorilla, mouse\u2013chimpanzee, rabbit\u2013chimpanzee, and gorilla\u2013chimpanzee have smaller distance, so they are more similar species pairs.

From Fig. 7A, we can find that opossum and gallus are most dissimilar with other species, while human\u2013gorilla has the smallest distance. Besides, human\u2013chimpanzee, gorilla\u2013chimpanzee, goat\u2013bovine are the more similar species. These results are overall in agreement with the results above. We calculate the contribution proportion of the six components, as shown in Fig. 7B, from which we find that the cumulative contribution proportion of the first two principal components is 92% of the total inertia of the six-dimension space vector.

We also propose six descriptors which can be obtained without complex calculations for DNA sequences from this novel model, and the PCA validate their efficiencies. Meanwhile, two simple methods are outlined to analyze similarities/dissimilarities among DNA sequences, and these two approaches can be easier to perform with low cost of runtime.",
