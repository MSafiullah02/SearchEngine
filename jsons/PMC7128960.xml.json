One of the main reasons for this lag compared to other organs is the lack of clear clinical perspectives. In the heart for instance, a variety of clinical studies involving stem cell-based myocardial regeneration after ischemic infarction have already been performed along with efforts to reconstruct congenital malformations by means of tissue engineering. Another explanation for the delayed development of regenerative therapies for respiratory disorders is the lack of suitable animal models that provide an unambiguous read out for the functionality of transplanted cells or for the regeneration of injured lung tissue.",

During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and the airways and alveoli are able to contract due to elastic fibers in their walls.

On the other hand, surfactant, a mixture of different lipids and certain proteins, greatly decreases surface tension thereby reducing considerably the effort required during inhalation and extension of the lung.",

            "text": "Different types of epithelium form the inner surface of the bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. Pseudo-stratified epithelium with mucosal goblet cells, ciliated epithelial cells, basal cells and Clara cells cover the conducting airways of the lung. Clustered neuroendocrine cells are located predominantly within the large proximal airways as neuroendocrine bodies [2]. While goblet cells produce mucins that protect the respiratory epithelium, the ciliated cells are responsible for the transportation of mucus, microorganisms and foreign particles, and for respiratory fluid removal for optimal gas exchange [3]. Clara cells, dome-shaped with short microvilli, were originally described by their namesake, Max Clara, and are non-mucous and non-ciliated secretory cells. One of the main functions of secretory epithelial cells is to protect the bronchiolar (and tracheal) epithelium by releasing a small variety of products, including Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) and components of the lung surfactant. They are also responsible for detoxifying harmful substances and may serve as progenitors of ciliated cells of the bronchiolar epithelium [4], [5], [6]. The majority of Clara cells are located in the respiratory bronchioles, which represent the transition from the conducting portion to the respiratory portion of the lung, the alveoli. These narrow channels are lined by a simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium. In contrast, the alveolar walls consist of a single layer of epithelium without ciliated epithelial cells. Ninety-five percent of the alveolar surface is covered by type I alveolar epithelial (AT1) cells. These are flattened, non-dividing cells that contain very limited numbers of organelles and form the air interface of the alveoli. In contrast, the more compact type II alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells contribute only to a minor extent to the alveolar surface. AT2 cells hold central functions: (i) production of surfactant. Surfactant decreases the surface tension within the lung thereby preventing a collapse of the alveoli, and fulfills specific immunological functions. (ii) Ion transport between alveolar fluid and interstitial tissue for alveolar fluid clearance [3]. (iii) AT2 cells represent progenitor cells, able to develop into AT1 cells [7], [8], [9] and (iv) exert certain immunological functions for instance by expressing Toll-like receptors [10], [11], by releasing or responding to cytokines [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] or by producing complement components [17], [18], [19].",

Besides infectious diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung tissues play a major role. Further severe pulmonary diseases that frequently result in terminal lung failure with parenchymal, bronchial, or pulmonary-vascular pathologies include genetic disorders such as \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which results in emphysema similar to COPD, and cystic fibrosis, vascular diseases (e.g. primary pulmonary hypertension) or interstitial lung disease that starts with inflammation of the bronchioles, alveoli or capillaries, and ends in pulmonary fibrosis.",

Importantly, a suitable stem cell source has to be identified that can be easily isolated or generated, cultured and expanded. Whether the optimal stem cell type, such as an exogenous adult stem cell (e.g. from bone marrow), an endogenous lung stem cell, which is more difficult to isolate especially in case of autologous cells, or a pluripotent stem cell (e.g. an induced pluripotent stem cell [28], [29]), can be easily collected mainly depends on the target disease. For example, for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis or surfactant protein B (SP-B) deficiency, stem cell derived bronchial [30] or alveolar epithelial cells have to be generated. Efforts are already underway to differentiate functional type II alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells [31], [32], [33], the exclusive natural producers of SP-C [34], for future therapy of surfactant protein C (SP-C) deficiency. For treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, several cell types such as hepatocytes as the principle natural source of alpha-1-antitrypsin, AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages [35], [36] are likely candidates.",

This finally leads to an almost complete and irreversible loss of alveolar microstructure (Fig. 2\n), a dramatic reduction of lung surface, and progressive shortness of breath. In addition, the patient experiences great difficulties in exhaling due to a reduced elasticity of the lung tissue, and the bronchial tubes may collapse, trapping air in the lungs. At least in a genetic mouse model, it has been demonstrated that wild type bone marrow transplantation can revert mild emphysema [46]. Another study reported that systemic administration of adrenomedullin, a potent vasodilator peptide, resulted in limited regeneration of alveoli and vasculature in elastase-induced established emphysema [40]. Although at this point mechanisms of the above findings are largely unknown, and although it appears unlikely that final stages of emphysema can be reverted using stem cell therapies, there is hope that prior to substantial manifestation of emphysema reversion of the disease may be possible applying novel regenerative technologies.",

In general, ILD appears to start with an inflammation affecting the bronchioles, the alveoli or capillaries of the lung. Inflammation of these parts of the lung may heal or may lead to necrosis or apoptosis of alveolar epithelium [48] and irreparable scarring of the lung tissue with abnormal accumulation of fibroblasts, and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix components in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. ILD can also be initiated by epithelial injury and abnormal wound repair in the absence of prior inflammation [49], [50]. Apparently, AT1 cells are more sensitive to injury than AT2 cells, and lung injuries that are restricted to AT1 cells are generally repairable by persisting AT2 cells [51]. In contrast, additional loss of AT2 cells as a source for new AT1 cells leads to irreversible loss of alveoli and progressing scar formation [52]. Probably, ILD is triggered by epithelial damage and depends on further injury-related immunological processes [49]. Similarly, a special form of pulmonary fibrosis in allografts, the so-called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, is triggered by ischemia reperfusion injury and depends additionally on alloreactive immunological processes [53], [54]. Some ILDs have known causes including occupational and environmental exposures, sarcoidosis, and connective tissue or collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis. Some (idiopathic) ILDs have unknown causes. An effective therapeutic regimen has yet to be identified and developed.",

Likewise, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been transplanted for inhibition of fibrosis [44], [45]. According to these studies, intra-tracheal and even intravenous application of AT2 cells or MSCs inhibited developing fibrosis. Notably, a low proportion of donor cells were detected in the injured lung tissue, only, and their differentiation into pulmonary phenotypes was not demonstrated unequivocally since epithelial characteristics of the donor derived cells were not demonstrated, or merely single marker proteins such as aquaporin 5 or SP-C were analyzed [44], [45]. In addition, cell fusion of donor cells with resident bronchioalveolar cells could not be excluded [45]. Hence, the observed inhibition of fibrosis is more likely based on paracrine effects. Clearly, concepts of treating fibrosis with bone marrow or blood-derived stem and progenitor cells, and especially with mesenchymal stem cells, have been challenged by recent findings that fibrotic tissue in ILD does not exclusively arise from resident fibroblasts or by epithelial\u2013mesenchymal-transition (EMT) [57], [58], but also from blood and bone marrow derived circulating cells [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67].",

In particular, it is contentious whether circulating extrapulmonary cells are able to adopt the fate of respiratory epithelial cells [68]. Recent studies suggested that such cells are able to support pathological mechanisms, moreover also the development of pulmonary diseases can be suppressed, while induction of pulmonary regeneration has been reported, too. Obviously, even minor technical details can determine whether a certain treatment protocol is able to inhibit progressing pulmonary diseases and to promote regeneration of injured lung tissue. Even if a certain stem cell type, for instance MSCs, does not efficiently differentiate into a functional cell type of interest, for example type II alveolar epithelial cells, alternative mechanisms such as cell fusion or paracrine effects may provide the basis for development of novel regenerative therapies that act via activation of endogenous regeneration potential.",

IB4-lectinpos basal cells [74], [75] and cells in the submucosal gland ducts [76] appear to hold stem cell function. These cell types were identified by: i) differentiation potential of labeled cells in vitro\n[77] or after inoculation in de-epithelialized rat tracheas and transplantation in nude mice [78], [79], [80], [81], ii) high cytokeratin expression as a marker for a primitive phenotype [76] or iii) bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) label retention documenting extended slow turnover of so-called label-retaining cells (LRCs)[76]. Multipotency of cytokeratin 14 expressing basal cells was demonstrated in a mouse model of naphthalene injury using a bitransgenic ligand-regulated Cre-loxP reporter approach in which expression of an ubiquitously expressed LacZ reporter was dependent on activation of the cytokeratin 14 promoter [74]. Tagged clusters of basal cells were multipotent and capable of generating basal, ciliated and secretory cells, other cells were unipotent and formed progeny with the morphology of basal cells, only. Thus, basal cells may consist of varied subpopulations with different differentiation potential that cannot currently be distinguished. Basal cells can be isolated according to the following protocol:1.After surgical isolation, the trachea should be stored on ice in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen Corporation Products, Karlsruhe, Germany), with antibiotics added, if necessary.2.Incubate the trachea with 0.05% protease for 24\u201348 h at 4 \u00b0C. Important: as activity of proteases usually varies, it is necessary to pretest different types/lots of proteases.3.Transfer the resulting cell suspension into a falcon tube and rinse the tracheal lumen with stop-medium (DMEM + 20% fetal calf serum, FCS). Transfer this stop-medium to the falcon tube. After pelleting, the cells are washed once with DMEM.4.Resuspend the cells in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (BEGM, Lonza GmbH, Wuppertal, Germany) and plate in tissue culture flasks (3 \u00d7 106 cells per T25 flask).5.After 48 h, remove medium with non-adherent cells. The remaining cells contain ciliated epithelium as well as basal cells.6.After 1 week, cells should be almost confluent. For passaging, cells are incubated with trypsin. By passaging, ciliated cells should be eliminated and the majority of remaining adherent cells represent basal cells.\n",

The non-ciliated columnar Clara cells [71], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87] have historically been considered as stem cells of the conducting airways. Similar to basal cells, labeled Clara cells have been inoculated in de-epithelialized rat tracheal grafts and gave rise to Clara and ciliated cells but not to basal and mucous cells [88], indicating that Clara cells are probably not the universal stem cells of the bronchial compartment. Although not confirmed, one report suggested that in turn ciliated cells have the potential to become Clara cells [89]. Others inoculated primary bronchial epithelial cells, which were not characterized in detail and may contain Clara cells as well as other cell types, after retroviral labeling in denuded rat tracheas [90], [91], [92]. In this model, lineage analyses demonstrated the existence of stem/progenitor cells with either limited or oligopotent capacity of differentiation. Single clones developed basal, goblet and ciliated epithelial morphologies, a subset of clones was able to develop mucosal glands [91].",

PNECs, identified based on their expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide [94], are principally derived from endoderm and not from neural crest [95]. In several studies Clara cells were ablated, either using naphthalene [83], [85], [86] or a conditional transgenic approach expressing herpes simplex thymidine kinase under control of the Clara cell secretory protein promoter [83], [87]. Napthalene is metabolized by P450-2F2 and -2B2 isoenzymes, expressed principally within Clara cells, resulting in the production of the highly toxic naphthalene 1 R 2 S epoxide [96], [97]. According to Hong et al. [83], PNECs function as self-renewing population of the neuroendocrine bodies (NEBs) [87], but are not able to contribute to the formation of new Clara cells and ciliated epithelium [83]. In contrast, a subpopulation of Clara cells that are deficient in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, resistant to naphthalene and specifically maintained in the NEB environment are capable of regenerating Clara cell depleted epithelium [83]. Similar naphthalene-resistant Clara-like cells could be found at the junction between conducting and respiratory epithelium, the bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) [82], [83], [86], [87].",

            "text": "Other early studies detected a small population of undifferentiated epithelial cells that labeled with tritiated thymidine but could not be distinguished at this time from slow cycling Clara cells by any of the known markers [72]. Already in 1988, it had been discussed whether there may be a pluripotent epithelial stem cell common to anatomically and functionally discrete segments of the distal respiratory system, namely bronchioli and alveoli [98]. Moreover, it had been proposed that these cells were located in a transitional zone between respiratory bronchioli and alveoli [99]. This bronchioalveolar stem cell (BASC) has now been identified as the normal counterpart to SP-C/CCSP double positive cells in adenomas [100] and is located at the BADJ [84]. These cells are also naphthalene-resistant and may be identical to cells that have been described earlier [72], [82], [83], [86], [87]. In contrast to Clara cells and AT2 cells, murine BASCs are positive for the membrane-bound stem cell markers CD34, the classical hematopoietic stem cell marker that is also present on endothelial cells [101], and Sca-1, a stem cell marker that can be found not only on murine bone marrow and resident stem cells of different tissue types, but also on endothelial cells including pulmonary ones [102]. Interestingly, anti mouse Sca-1 has been used to isolate human cardiac stem cells (A. Smits, Utrecht, pers. communication) although no Sca-1 homolog has been identified in humans. Expression of both markers has enabled the flow cytometrical purification and characterization of BASCs. BASCs can be isolated from murine lung tissue as follows:1.After anesthesia mice are perfused with 10 mL PBS, followed by intra-tracheal instillation of 1 mL dispase (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany, 50 U/mL) and 1 mL 1% low melting point agarose.2.Subsequently, lungs are minced on ice and incubated in 0.001% DNAse (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and 2 \u03bcg/mL collagenase/dispase (Roche, Grenzach\u2013Wyhlen, Germany) in PBS for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C.3.The resulting crude cell suspension is filtered through 100 and 40 \u03bcm cell strainers (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 800 rpm, 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.4.Cells are resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA) for 4 min, washed in DME/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and resuspended in PBS/10% FBS (PF10) at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/100 \u03bcL.5.For FACSorting, cells are incubated 15 min at 4 \u00b0C with 1 \u03bcL of the appropriate antibodies (anti-Sca-1, anti-CD45, anti-PECAM, anti-CD34) for surface marker staining.\n",

Oct-4 is a typical marker for embryonic stem cells but has now also been reported in tissue resident stem cells [104], [105], [106]. In this context it should be noted that analysis of Oct-4 expression in adult tissue and stem cells critically depends on the discrimination of Oct-4 isoforms and pseudogenes as described in detail by Liedtke et al. [107]. Oct-4 expressing pulmonary stem cells appears to be the main target for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) infection [103]. For isolation of these cells, lung tissue was minced and enzymatically digested resulting in a mixed cell population containing stem cell colonies with epithelial morphology. Obviously, cell growth was supported by pulmonary mesenchymal cells similar to ESCs that depend on embryonic feeder cells under standard culture conditions. In culture, these cells also express SSEA-1, another ESC marker. Whether SSEA-1 is also expressed in vivo has not been analyzed. In addition, these cells express Sca-1 similarly to BASCs, and Cytokeratin-7, a marker for epithelium, as well as CCSP and CyP450, both Clara cell markers, and appear to represent Clara/alveolar epithelial stem cells [103]. Differentiation experiments resulted in expression of AT2 (SP-C) and AT1 (aquaporin 5) markers. Thus, Ling et al. apparently described the same cells as Kim et al. [84]. Although in another publication the distribution of Oct-4pos/CD34pos (as already mentioned, no protein that corresponds to the murine Sca-1 is known in humans) and SARS-permissive cells was found to be extended to the alveoli of the adult human lung, and although these cells may not express SSEA1, cytokeratin, SP-C and SP-A in vivo, it is likely that they represent the human counterpart of BASCs [108].",

After isolation, the trachea can be cannulated with a 20-gauge luer stub adapter. Then the diaphragm has to be cut, and the chest plate and thymus have to be removed.3.With the use of a 21-gauge needle fitted on a 10-ml syringe, lungs can be perfused with 10\u201320 ml 0.9% saline via the pulmonary artery.4.Subsequently, dispase (3 ml) has to be rapidly instilled through the cannula in the trachea followed by 0.5 ml agarose (45 \u00b0C).5.Lungs should be covered immediately with ice for 2 min to gel the agarose. Then lungs can be removed from the animals and incubated in 1 ml dispase for 45 min (25 \u00b0C).6.Lungs are then transferred to a 60-mm culture dish containing 7 ml of HEPES-buffered DMEM and 100 U/ml DNAse I, and lung tissue is gently teased from the bronchi.7.Subsequently, the cell suspension is filtered through progressively smaller cell strainers (100 and 40 \u03bcm) and nylon gauze (20 \u03bcm).8.Cells can be collected by centrifugation at 130g for 8 min (4 \u00b0C) and placed on prewashed 100-mm tissue culture plates that have been coated for 24\u201348 h at 4 \u00b0C with 42 \u03bcg CD45 and 16 \u03bcg CD32 in PBS. After incubation for 1\u20132 h at 37 \u00b0C, AT2 cells can be gently panned from the plate and collected by centrifugation.9.Finally, AT2 cells are resuspended in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (BEGM, Lonza GmbH) supplemented with 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA). Cells are cultured in six well plates coated with 1 ml of Matrigel that had been diluted with BEGM (1:2, BEGM/Matrigel).

SP cells can be detected by FACS after excitation by a UV-laser resulting in a characteristic cell population with low blue and red fluorescence emission.

Likewise, subsequent to the staining process, the cells should be maintained at 4 \u00b0C in order to prevent further dye efflux. Pulmonary SP cells can be collected from enzyme-digested lungs and by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).1.For lung digestion, mince freshly isolated lung tissue with a razor blade and incubate the minced tissue with 0.1% collagenase (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), 2.4 U/ml dispase (Roche Diagnostics), and 2.5 mM CaCl2 at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. After adding an equal volume DMEM + 20% FBS to stop the enzymatic digestion, cell suspensions are sequentially filtered through 70- and 40-\u03bcm filters to remove nonspecific debris, and then resuspended at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per ml in pre-warmed DMEM + 5% FBS. Mix well.2.BAL cells can be collected according to published protocols [118]: in brief, after cannulation of the trachea, lungs are insufflated with 1 ml of PBS. Wash fluid is removed and placed into a collection tube. This process has to be repeated until each lung has been lavaged with a total of 5 ml of PBS. To remove nonspecific debris, cell suspensions are sequentially filtered through 70- and 40-\u03bcm filters and then resuspended at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml in pre-warmed DMEM + 5% FBS.3.Ensure that a water bath is precisely at 37 \u00b0C. The medium needs to be pre-warmed beforehand.4.Add Hoechst dye to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml.5.Mix the cells well, and place in the 37 \u00b0C water bath for 90 min exactly. Tubes should be mixed several times during incubation.6.After 90 min, spin down the cells at 4 \u00b0C and resuspend in ice-cold PBS.7.All further proceedings should be carried out at 4 \u00b0C to prohibit leakage of the Hoechst dye. Add 2 \u03bcg/ml of 7-AAD to the suspended cells and mix about 5 min before FACS analysis. This will allow for the discrimination of dead versus live cells as 7-AAD permeates only cells that do not have an intact membrane.8.Flow cytometry analysis of Hoechst-stained cells can be performed on a triple laser flow cytometer (MoFlo; Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). An argon multiline UV (333\u2013363 nm) laser is necessary to excite Hoechst dye. Fluorescence emission can be collected with a 405/30 band pass filter (Hoechst blue) and a 660 ALP (Hoechst red). A second 488-nm argon laser has to be used to excite 7-AAD.\n",

            "text": "Lung SP cells can be sub-divided into CD45pos and CD45neg cells. According to Summer et al. [114], \u223c60\u201375% of murine lung SP cells express CD45 [113], [114]. CD45pos SP cells exhibit a small, round phenotype with scant cytoplasm and large nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio similar to bone marrow SP cells. In contrast, CD45neg SP cells are larger with abundant cytoplasm. Hematoxylin staining demonstrated extensive granularity. CD34 was detected on murine CD45pos cells only, whereas Sca-1 was present on the majority of both subpopulations, which may indicate overlap of side population cells with BASCs [84]. Furthermore, all CD45pos cells and about 40% of the CD45neg side population cells were CD31pos suggesting the possibility that lung SP cells play a role in homeostasis of the pulmonary vasculature [113]. A recent study compared clonogenicity of SP preparations derived from different lung compartments under different culture conditions [115]. Clonogenicity was compromised by previous bleomycin treatment and varied significantly among different preparations and different media. Whereas expression of the lung epithelial markers SP-C and CCSP was almost undetectable in SP preparations, vimentin mRNA was highly enriched suggesting a mesenchymal phenotype with wound-repair potential [115]. These results are in contrast to previous studies [82], [113]; most likely, this is based on technical reasons. In particular, drawbacks of the Hoechst efflux technique concerning the parallel purification of different stem cell types have been emphasized [115]. As determined by whole bone marrow transplantations, at least a considerable proportion of CD45pos and CD45neg lung side population cells are bone marrow derived [114]. However, recent results do not exclude that a fraction of side population cells exist in the adult lung that has been formed already during embryogenesis.",

At present, it is still not always clear whether indeed stem or progenitor cells have been identified, and further work is necessary to achieve a clear characterization and classification of the numerous cell types contributing to lung homeostasis and repair. Although significant progress in the field has been achieved, further improvement and development of methods for purification of resident stem cells and functional testing in vitro is mandatory. To date, lung stem cell purification has frequently been limited by the fact that molecular markers for respiratory stem cells are intracellular proteins that are not restricted to specific levels of the stem cell hierarchy. Thus, identification of additional markers, biochemical activities or biophysical properties enabling discrimination and purification of distinct stem cell types would greatly advance further analysis of mechanisms underlying stem cell-based lung repair and the development of regenerative therapies.",

Whether resident pulmonary stem cells can finally act as a basis to induce endogenous regeneration after injury or whether some of these cells can be isolated, expanded and differentiated for cell therapeutic approaches remains to be demonstrated.",

Bone marrow contains classical hematopoietic as well as other types of stem cells including mesenchymal stem cells [125] and so-called MAPCs [123]. Recent studies suggest that bone marrow derived cells have the capacity to produce not only hematopoietic phenotypes but can also differentiate into non-hematopoietic derivatives including muscle [126], heart [127], [128], brain [129] and liver [121]. Although many of these studies are controversial and contradictory reports demonstrate that certain findings are based on technical artifacts [130], [131], [132], [133], [134], [135], it is clear that the commitment of bone marrow stem cells is not as strict as initially thought.",

For instance, Krause et al. reported a robust contribution of donor cells to bronchial and alveolar epithelium after transplantation of single bone marrow stem cells, reaching 3.74% for bronchial and 20.20% for AT2 cells after 11 months [121]. The same group observed significantly less contribution to alveolar epithelium after lethal irradiation and whole bone marrow transplantation with a range of 0.6\u20138.1% of donor AT2 cells [42]. No donor derived AT2 cells but AT1 cells and significant numbers of donor derived interstitial fibroblasts (between 5% and 20% in isolated cells) have been detected in a parabiotic mouse model [41]. Similarly, another study did not find any donor derived AT2 cells, but AT1 cells, and additionally donor-derived CD34pos CD45neg cells that may represent endothelial cells [38]. Cytokeratinpos epithelial as well as CD34pos endothelial cells of donor origin were observed by Ishizawa et al. after elastase-induced emphysema [39]. This was not the case in a model of compensatory lung growth: bone marrow transplantation after lethal irradiation did result in bone marrow engraftment and vascular differentiation within the bone marrow, but not in contribution to pulmonary endothelium [124].",

Notably, fusion of bone marrow cells with resident somatic ones can result in donor cells with pulmonary phenotypes, and discrimination is possible, only, using sophisticated transgenic approaches. Additionally, there is no evidence so far that the observed donor-derived cells expressing certain pulmonary markers are phenotypically or functionally comparable to the corresponding native cell type.",

            "text": "With respect to the limited significance of animal models for regeneration of the human respiratory system, studies on human tissue are of special importance. A number of recent papers that analyzed not only the presence and frequency but also the phenotype of recipient cells in transplanted solid organs indicated that circulating cells enter the lung and are able to develop into different pulmonary cell types [139], [140], [141], [142], [143]. Most studies combined Y-chromosome-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with immunohistology for cytokeratin or SP-C. Another study used a more sophisticated approach combining immunostaining with laser microdissection and short tandem repeat PCR. Dependent on the approach and the analyzed grafts, 0\u201325% of donor/recipient chimerism was observed in bronchi, alveoli and glands. An initial study did not detect any donor/recipient chimerism in epithelia of bronchi or alveoli, or in the pulmonary blood vessels of the donor lung [139], which is in accordance with another study demonstrating only minor recipient contribution to the donor epithelium [143]. Later studies reported low levels of chimerism in respiratory epithelium between 2% and 8% [141], [142]. Much higher levels [up to 42%] were observed in pulmonary endothelium [141]. In contrast, another study that did not use FISH but performed short tandem repeat PCR of laser microdissected cells observed epithelial chimerism in bronchi, alveoli and glands of up to 25% [140]. Since recent findings are so far inconsistent, results should be judged with caution. At present, it is unclear whether technical details or differences in the analyzed donor grafts account for the reported differences. Moreover, it is still a matter of debate whether the potential contribution of extrapulmonary cells to respiratory epithelium and endothelium indicate replacement of lost cell populations during normal tissue homeostasis or is related to allogeneic immune reactions, inflammation and corresponding tissue damage.",

The respiratory differentiation potential of extrapulmonary stem cells is controversial and the usefulness of such cells for the development of regenerative therapies for the treatment of lung diseases is unclear. Clearly, the development of improved and novel molecular, histological and transgenic techniques is urgently needed to allow an unequivocal analysis of the contribution of adult stem cells to pulmonary pathogenesis and regeneration.",

            "text": "The identification of different resident pulmonary stem cells and the accumulating evidence for a pulmonary differentiation potential of certain extrapulmonary stem cells raises hope that stem cell biology and technology will eventually turn cell therapy into a useful treatment for a variety of lung diseases. Nonetheless, compared to other organ systems such as bone and heart, research on pulmonary regeneration and development of regenerative therapies targeting respiratory disorders is only beginning. Similar to other fields of stem cell research, the pulmonary differentiation potential of adult stem and progenitor cells is currently highly controversial. Further work in transgenic models as well as intensified research on human stem cells is urgently needed to clarify whether adult stem cells will be clinically useful and whether pluripotent stem cell types such as spermatogonial, embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells will play a role. Further problems in the field include the lack of suitable animal models that closely mirror important human diseases and enable proof of functionality of stem cell derivatives. The fact that the most common lung diseases result in emphysema or fibrosis, both characterized by continuing pathological alteration of the natural tissue morphology and finally leading to almost complete destruction of the functional lung architecture, poses further challenges. At present, it is difficult to imagine that advanced stages of such diseases can be reversed using stem cell-based technologies. Thus, while pulmonary stem cell biology is exciting and in many ways promising, our meager understanding of these processes is limiting rapid therapeutic advances.",
