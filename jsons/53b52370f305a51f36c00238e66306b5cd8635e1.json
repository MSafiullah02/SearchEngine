The AAMC standard is for medical students to complete about 8 weeks of surgical clerkship to graduate [7] . Current challenges center on exposing students to the surgical discipline without exposing them to COVID-19. To mitigate the halt on in-hospital clerkships, medical schools are maximizing the use of virtual learning platforms [2, 4] . Virtual learning goes beyond delivering didactic materials online. Platforms exist that provide clinical skills with decision-making exercises. Such interactive platforms, like Aquifer-Wise MD, maintain the flow of robust information [4] . These interactive platforms provide surgical anatomy reviews, surgical procedure walkthroughs, practice test questions, and intricate patient cases [4] . Students practice developing differential diagnoses and improve clinical reasoning. Using this method of continuing education, students are exercising skills for their surgical clerkship. A study by Lindeman et al. demonstrated the use of virtual learning in a surgical clerkship resulted in noninferior academic outcomes with improved student satisfaction [4] In another study by Chapman et al, medical students reported a lack of preparedness to be a significant factor contributing to unsatisfactory operating room (OR) learning experiences [8] . Through virtual learning, medical students will be more prepared when returning to their clerkships, capturing more positive learning experiences.",

In regard to new fourth-year medical students pursuing a surgical residency, clerkship directors should adjust the fourth-year schedule to permit the completion of online electives, such as radiology, during this delay [9] . This allows students to reschedule surgical rotations, gathering more OR time. In addition to the previously mentioned resources, students can take advantage of online courses in suturing techniques with at-home practice kits. Though this does not fully replace hands-on experiences, continuing education through virtual means is the best approach to mitigate lost time in the operating room [3, 4] .",

While some programs have adjusted their infrastructure to temporarily address the aforementioned obstacles, their strategies should be to integrate the essential didactic materials, mitigate the resident schedule disruption, and address the rising instances of resident burnout [11] . In an effort to resolve these issues, our program reconstructed the residents into two teams. One team focused on clinical care while the other concentrates on didactic-centered materials. This strategy fits the clinical team with the appropriate numbers of residents required to deliver quality care and cover the reduced surgical volume. Since the teams alternate each week between the clinical and didactic, there is a reduction in exposures and in the use of PPE. A beneficial aspect of this design is the creation of a reserve workforce, which mitigates the effect of losing a resident to quarantine or isolation.",

Hangouts offers online lectures, curriculum modules, and educational videos for residents to follow along each week [5] . In addition to virtual surgical education, a major benefit of establishing a didactic rotation is addressing the issue of resident burnout.

Simulations provide residents with a means to continue practicing their surgical skills with attending supervision [12, 14] . This provides residents with a means to prepare and review pertinent cases related to their procedural quotas. To acquaint residents with specialties, programs can continue to engage residents through the aforementioned virtual means with their current assigned specialty service.

The novel solutions created demonstrate the vast potential and benefits of virtual learning. Regarding surgical clerkships, the permanent employment of blended learning should be established. As a study by Hew and Lo demonstrated, students exhibited a significant improvement in academic performance when taught via a blended learning style versus a traditional teaching method (standard mean difference = 0.33, CI = 0.21-0.46, p \\ 0.001) [3] . Utilizing interactive online modules creates students who are primed for their surgical clerkship, enhancing their surgical experiences. For surgical residency programs, it is imperative to consider weaving in virtual didactic sessions into their schedules. This strategy is a viable approach to tackling resident burnout by allowing more time for mindfulness, improving overall mental health and morale [13] . Utilizing blended learning in residency promotes ''dual coding'' of both visual and verbal experiences, which is associated with enhanced residents' recall and retention. Additionally, virtual learning provides avenues for surgeons to complete required continuing education courses. The time saved from traveling to distant sites can instead be allocated to self-care time, helping address physician burnout [15] . The recommendations to incorporate virtual learning at each level of surgical education creates a constant flow of technological exposure. Gaps in technological familiarity are diminished [16] . Across all levels of surgical education, virtual learning provides 24/7 accessible interactive platforms and online resources to continually enrich surgical training. At present, virtual learning serves as a means to improve surgical education by creating easily accessible platforms for distributing knowledge and practicing skills, not as a full replacement for hands-on clinical experiences. Given the current circumstances, we have the opportunity to begin mastering virtual learning. Thus, programs can begin to expand and improve their curriculums, maintaining pace with technological developments and innovations.",
