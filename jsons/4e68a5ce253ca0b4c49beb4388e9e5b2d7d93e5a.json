Viral genetic sequences encoding for structural proteins and open reading frames 6-8 were determined in the original clinical specimen, the initial virus isolate (passage 0) and at passages 5, 10, and 15. After 15 passages, a total of 15 different mutations were identified and 12 of them were non-synonymous mutations. Seven of these mutations were recurrent mutation and all located at the spike, membrane, and Orf 8a protein encoding sequences. Mutations in the membrane protein and a deletion in ORF 6-8 were already observed in passage 0, suggesting these amino acid substitutions are important in the adaptation of the virus isolate in primate cell culture. A mutation in the spike gene (residue 24079) appeared to be unique to adaptation in FRhK4 cells. It is important to be aware of cell culture associated mutations when interpreting data on molecular evolution of SARS coronavirus.",

We used four independent viral isolates and serially passaged these viruses in these two cell lines. The sequence of the virus in the original clinical specimen was compared with that of the initial isolate and subsequent passages. To avoid possible bias generated from clone selection, we did not plaque purified the progeny viruses during the passage. Instead, we used supernatants from virus cultures for subsequent infection and for sequencing. Thus, our results represented the dominant viral species in these passages. Previous studies indicated that the overall mutation rate for SARS-CoV in cell culture was found to be low [Vega et al., 2004] . It was therefore expected that, the recurrent mutations identified in this study would not be a random event and might be highly relevant to host adaptation or to tissue tropism. We observed a total of 15 different mutations in this study. Seven point mutations (residues 23412, 23473, 23518, 23632, 24079, 24864, and 24978) were observed in the S gene. The M gene was found to contain 2 point mutations (residues 26477 and 26600). There was 1 point mutation (residue 27995) and 1 deletion (residues 27808-27809) in the Orf 6-8 region. Four mutations were identified in the N gene (residues 28161, 28557, 29294, and 29366). By contrast, no mutation was observed in the E gene.",

This selection pressure was further highlighted by the fact that 7 out of these 12 non-synonymous mutations were recurrent mutations. All of these recurrent mutations were located at the S, M, and Orf 8a sequences. While a number of these recurrent mutations occurred in both Vero E6 and FRhK4 cell passaged viruses, one mutation (residue 24079) appeared unique to FRhK4 cell culture. Three of these recurrent mutations (point mutations in residue 26600 and 264777, and a dinucleotide-deletion in residues 27808-27809) were already apparent in the first passage of the virus. These results suggest these positions, in particular to those mutations found in the early passages, might be critical for adaptation of the virus in culture.",

The polymorphism at position 26477 could be observed from direct sequencing of viruses from original clinical samples [Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004] . The polymorphism at position 26600 was also found in some published viral sequences (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/SARS/sarsnuc.html). However, there was insufficient information on cell culture passage history of these viruses to know whether this mutation is a natural sequence variation or a mutation selected by cell culture in vitro. Interestingly, based on the polymorphisms in these two positions, all of our clinical isolates and published viral sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/SARS/sarsnuc. html, N \u00bc 111) could be classified into GC, TT and TC genotypes. By contrast, no GT genotype was observed in all available sequences, suggesting the virus does not tolerant this genotype. In our study, both strains A and D in our study have a C to T mutation at position 26600. This mutation converted strain A from a TC to a TT genotype. For the strain D, an additional G to T mutation at position 26477 was observed, these double mutations thereby converting strain D from a GC to a TT phenotype. It should be noted that these mutations resulted in changing the amino acid residues in the first and second transmembrane helix domains [Marra et al., 2003] . It is therefore tempting to speculate that the amino acids at these positions are important for the toplogy of the protein and that the virus would introduce a complementary mutation in these positions to prevent the generation of a GT genotype. Further structure studies on this protein are required to prove this hypothesis.",

Subsequent investigations further revealed similar nucleotide deletions in most of human isolates [Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Vega et al., 2004] . Besides, Thiel et al. [2003] had reported the emergence of a 45-nucleotide deletion in the Orf 7b following passage in Vero E6 cells. These findings suggested that a deletion in these regions might be associated with host adaptations. We therefore sequenced the Orf 6-8 of all our viruses and identified a silent mutation in the Orf 8b ( Table I) . All of our original clinical isolates maintained the 29-nt deletion throughout the passages and we did not observe deletion in Orfs 6 and 7. However, a dinucleotide deletion at nt 27808-27809 in strains A and D was identified. This deletion leads to a frame shift mutation in Orf 8a. The same deletion was found in two published sequences (strains TWC and WHU). These published sequences were derived from viruses passaged in Vero E6 cells [Yan et al., 2004; Yeh et al., 2004] . It should be noted that, apart from the above deletions, several other deletions in the Orf 8 sequence were detected from other isolates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/SARS/sarsnuc. html). Although the function of Orf 8a is not clear, these observations clearly suggested that Orf 8a and its protein were dispensable in cell cultures.",
