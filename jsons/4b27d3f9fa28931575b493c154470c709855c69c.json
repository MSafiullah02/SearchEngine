As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22). Cases were isolated on average 4\u00b76 days (95% CI 4\u00b71-5\u00b70) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1\u00b79 days (95% CI 1\u00b71-2\u00b77). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6\u00b727 [95% CI 1\u00b749-26\u00b733] for household contacts and 7\u00b706 [1\u00b743-34\u00b791] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11\u00b72% (95% CI 9\u00b71-13\u00b78), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7\u00b74% in children <10 years vs population average of 6\u00b76%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0\u00b74 (95% CI 0\u00b73-0\u00b75), with a mean serial interval of 6\u00b73 days (95% CI 5\u00b72-7\u00b76).",

This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.",

As of April 15, 2020, there have been 1 914 916 confirmed cases and 123 010 deaths reported worldwide. 5 Most cases were initially confined to Hubei province in China, but there has since been substantial spread not only elsewhere in China but worldwide. A rapid and robust response by the global scientific community has described many important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and natural history, 1,2,6-8 but key questions remain.",

Careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, important to modelling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we can make assumptions about when and where cases were likely to have been infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing important information about transmission and natural history. Combined, these data on early introductions can be used to give insights into the natural history of the disease, 9 transmission characteristics, 10 and the unseen burden of infection. 11 Here, we use data collected by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shenzhen CDC) on 391 cases of COVID-19 and 1286 of their close contacts to characterise key aspects of its epidemiology outside of Hubei province. We characterise differences in demographics and severity between cases identified through symptom-based surveillance and monitoring of close case contacts, and estimate the time to key events, such as confirmation, isolation, and recovery. Using data from contact tracing, we characterise SARS-CoV-2 transmission by estimating key values, such as the household secondary attack rate, serial interval, and observed reproductive number (R).",

We present one of the first estimates of the serial interval, secondary household attack rate, and dispersion (ie, tendency towards super spreading) for SARS-CoV-2 based on active surveillance data. We found that the attack rate does not differ significantly by age, with on average 7% of close contacts becoming infected, around 80% of these contacts showing any symptoms, and 3% of infections manifesting severe disease at initial assessment. We also found that contactbased surveillance in Shenzhen reduced the duration an infected individual transmits in the community by 2 days.

The mean R and distribution of individual reproductive numbers (ie, the number of secondary infections caused by each case) were calculated from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case, with ambiguities resolved through multiple imputation (appendix 2 p 11). The relative odds of transmission among contacts of various types were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression and random-effects models, to account for differing numbers of possible infected individuals in each risk group.

We considered periods where the mean infectious day is less than 15 days after symptom onset (roughly the period of SARS and early SARS-CoV-2 reports 16, 17 ) , and assumed that R=2\u00b76 and that isolation effectively ends the infectious period. Under these assumptions we found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0\u00b74, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5\u00b75 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset.",

            "text": "The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analyses of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, indicate that infection rates in young children are not lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We were able to directly estimate important transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic by these measures. This work further supports the understanding of COVID-19 as a disease with a fairly short incubation period (mean 4-6 days) but a long clinical course, 2,7,18 with patients taking many weeks to die or recover. Notably, however, we estimate a higher proportion of cases taking 14 days or more to develop symptoms (5%) than estimated in the study by Lauer and colleagues (1%). 6 Focusing on cases detected through contact-based surveillance adds nuance to previous characterisations of COVID-19. Since RT-PCR testing of contacts is near universal, we can assume these cases are more reflective of the average SARS-CoV-2 infection than cases detected through symptomatic surveillance. In the contact-based surveillance group, any tendency for cases to be male or older (beyond the underlying population distribution) disappears. Furthermore, in this group, 20% of cases were asymptomatic at the time of first clinical assessment and nearly 30% did not have a fever. This observation is consistent with a reasonably high rate of asymptomatic carriage, but lower than that suggested by some modelling studies, 19 although RT-PCR has imperfect sensitivity. 20 In Shenzhen, SARS-CoV-2 transmission most probably occurred between very close contacts, such as individuals sharing a household. However, even in this group fewer than one in six contacts (ie, secondary attack rate 11-15%) were infected, and overall we observed far fewer than one (0\u00b74) onward transmission per primary case. As noted above, low transmission levels might in part be due to the impact of isolation and surveillance, but it is equally likely that unobserved trans mission has some role. We also estimated reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases caused by each infected individual, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters can occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing R below one-events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system. This work has numerous limitations. As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed. Hence, there might be noise and inconsistency in definitions. Notably, the definition of a confirmed case changed to require symptoms near the end of our analysis period (Feb 7), but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively influence results (appendix 2 pp 5-6). It is, likewise, impossible to identify every potential contact an individual has, so contact tracing focuses on those close contacts who are most likely to be infected; hence our R is assuredly lower than the true reproductive number in the population. Asymptomatic travellers will be missed by symptom-based surveillance and, even if they are tested, some asymptomatic contacts might be missed because of the imperfect sensitivity of the RT-PCR test. 20 Recovery time in Shenzhen is likely to be inflated because cases are required to be isolated for 2 weeks and release is conditional on a negative RT-PCR test. Although guidelines for contact tracing and case detection are supposed to be implemented across the country, whether the impact of contact tracing can be generalised to other parts of China depends on a range of factors, including local testing capacity and surveillance resources.",
