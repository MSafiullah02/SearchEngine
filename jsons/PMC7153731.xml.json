The first documented outbreaks were recorded in 1944 and 1945, where 200 cases of a severe hemorrhagic disease occurred in Russia. Later, the russian virus was shown to be antigenically identical to a virus isolated from a febrile patient in the Congo [13]. Nowadays, CCHFV is known to be widely distributed throughout large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, the Balcans, Northern Greece, European Russia, Pakistan, the Xinjiang province of Northwest China, the Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, Iraq and Iran [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. CCHFV is the second most widespread arbovirus of medical importance after Dengue virus, [25], [26]. CCHFV also infects animals, but these remain asymptomatic as shown for cattle, sheep, goats, camels and hares. Antibodies against CCHFV have been demonstrated in sera of horses, goats, and cattle in endemic areas [25], [26]. The virus can be transmitted to humans through ticks of the genus Hyalomma, in particular Hylomma marginatum marginatum\n[25], [26]. CCHFV has also been isolated from other Hyalomma species. Human infection also occurs by contact with blood or tissue material from infected animals or humans. In addition, person-to-person transmission can occur via bloody vomit, body fluids or by aerosol from patients in advanced stages of disease [27], [28], [29]. Therefore, risk groups are found among professions with contact to infected animals (e.g. livestock breeders, abattoir workers) or infected humans (e.g. health care workers) [30].",

The incubation period ranges from a few days up to 1 week, the length most probably depending on the transmission route and the amount of inoculum. The pre-hemorrhagic phase usually initiates with fever, myalgia, dizziness, headache and vomiting and ends on average after 3 days. The hemorrhagic fever phase is short and characterized by epistaxis, bleeding from the gastrointestinal system, urinary and respiratory tract and also skin bleeding ranging from petechiae to ecchymoses. Other symptoms include enlarged spleen and liver which approximately 30% of patients experience. The average mortality rate is 30% but can be as high as 70% [31], [32], [33] The severity of disease has been shown to correlate to the amount of virus in the blood (up to 109 genome equivalents/ml blood) [34], [35].

            "text": "IFN induction in fibroblasts occurs mainly by an intracellular pathway (Fig. 2\n). Hallmark molecules of RNA viruses such as double-stranded (ds) RNA and 5\u2032-triphosphorylated single-stranded (ss) RNA trigger a signalling chain which activates IFN-\u03b2 gene expression [52], [53], [54], [55]. Two RNA helicases, RIG-I and MDA-5, are the main intracellular receptors of viral RNA [56], [57], [58]. RIG-I and MDA-5 recognize different and non-overlapping sets of viruses, suggesting a degree of specificity in RNA recognition [59]. Indeed, it was recently found that RIG-I has the unique ability to bind the triphosphate groups on the 5\u2032-end of uncapped viral ssRNA [53], [54], [55]. Moreover, RIG-I binds to short dsRNA molecules whereas MDA-5 activation is apparently more dependent on long dsRNA structures [60]. The binding of a viral RNA to RIG-I and MDA-5 induces a signalling chain which eventually results in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF-3 [61]. IRF-3 is a member of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family [62] and plays a central role in the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. Phosphorylated IRF-3 homo-dimerises and moves into the nucleus where it initiates IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis. This first-wave IFN triggers expression of a related factor, IRF-7, which in fibroblasts is only present in low amounts [63]. Expression and activation of IRF-7 leads to a positive-feedback loop that initiates the synthesis of several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes as the second-wave IFNs. In addition, the transcription factors NF\u2013\u03baB (activated by RIG-I, MDA-5 and the dsRNA-dependent kinase PKR) and AP-1 (activated by stress-induced Jun kinase) are triggered by viral replication to enhance IFN gene expression [64], [65]\n",

Binding of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 leads to conformational changes in the intracellular parts of the receptor, which activate the so-called JAK-STAT signalling pathway. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors which become phosphorylated by the Janus kinase (JAK) family members JAK-1 and TYK-2 [70], [71]. Phosphorylated STAT-1 and STAT-2 recruit a third factor, IRF-9 (also called p48), to form a complex known as IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3). The ISGF-3 heterotrimer translocates to the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoter regions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby inducing their transcription.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activate the expression of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) which have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory functions [72]. IFN-induced proteins include enzymes, transcription factors, cell surface glycoproteins, cytokines, chemokines and a large number of factors with unknown function. Up to now, only a few proteins with antiviral activity have been characterized in detail. These are the Mx GTPases, the protein kinase R (PKR), the 2\u2032,5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetases (2\u20135 OAS)/RNaseL system, the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR 1), viperin, and the products of the ISG56 (p56) and ISG20 genes. Mx proteins belong to the superfamily of dynamin-like large GTPases and have been discovered as mediators of genetic resistance against orthomyxoviruses in mice. The human MxA protein blocks replication of the infecting virus soon after cell entry by targeting and missorting viral ribonucleoprotein particles [73], [74]. PKR, 2\u20135 OAS and ADAR are constitutively expressed in a latent, inactive form. Basal mRNA levels are upregulated by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and these enzymes need to be activated by viral dsRNA. PKR is also activated by ssRNA containing a 5\u2032 triphosphate group and a short stem-loop [75]. PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 [76], thus blocking translation of cellular and viral mRNAs. The 2\u20135 OAS catalyses the synthesis of short 2\u2032,5\u2032 oligoadenylates [77] that activate the latent endoribonuclease RNaseL which in turn degrades both viral and cellular RNAs [78]. ADAR 1 catalyzes the deamination of adenosine on target dsRNAs to yield inosine. As a result the secondary structure is destabilized due to a change from an AU base pair to the less stable IU base pair and mutations accumulate within the viral genome [42]. Viperin is localized at the ER membrane and impairs the formation of lipid rafts which are need by some viruses for replication or budding [79], [80]. P56 binds the eukaryotic initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3. It functions as an inhibitor of translation initiation at the level of eIF3 ternary complex formation and is likely to suppress viral RNA translation [81]. ISG20 is an IFN-induced 3\u2032,5\u2032 exonuclease that specifically degrades ssRNA in vitro. In cell culture, expression of ISG20 leads to a reduction of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus and retrovirus replication [82].",

As a similar MxA-N interaction is known from other bunyaviruses [97], [98], it is likely that all bunyaviruses may be restricted in their intracellular growth by MxA, and probably by the same mechanism. However, by using an siRNA approach to deplete cells from MxA, we could demonstrate that MxA is not the sole player in IFN-induced antiviral activity against CCHFV [91]. Our most recent studies indicate a contribution of ISG20 and PKR (manuscripts in preparation).

            "text": "Despite being strongly inhibited by type I IFNs, CCHFV still runs its devastating course in the human host. Estimates of CCHFV mortality range from a few percent to up to 70% [13], [32], [99]. Likely explanations for this discrepancy are that virus-induced IFN has no therapeutic, but only a prophylactic effect, or that production of IFN by infected cells is inefficient. In fact, recent data show that both these mechanisms seem to be in place. We have shown that IFN has no significant activity against an already established CCHFV infection [100]. Treatment of cells with 1000 U/ml IFN at 1 h after infection is ineffective, whereas the same dose applied before infection results in a significant inhibition of CCHFV replication. This indicates that CCHFV strongly counteracts IFN signalling, and experiments are underway to clarify this issue. In addition, CCHFV appears to counteract the induction of IFN synthesis by several independent strategies. Firstly, it is conceivable that, similar to other negative-strand RNA viruses and bunyaviruses [52], CCHFV does not produce significant amounts of the IFN inducer molecule dsRNA. Our ongoing studies are aimed at testing this assumption. Secondly, we found that the important RIG-I signaling pathway which is triggered by viral ssRNA carrying a 5\u2032 triphosphate is not activated by the CCHFV genome [101]. Whereas the ssRNA genome of the related Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) contains a 5\u2032 triphosphate group and induces IFN induction via RIG-I, the CCHFV genome contains a RIG-I-neutral 5\u2032monophosphate. Most likely, CCHFV cleaves off the 5\u2032 triphosphate group during genome replication in order to escape recognition by RIG-I. In line with this, IFN induction by CCHFV-infected cells is weak and occurs relatively late [100]. Members of the family Bunyaviridae therefore appear to have evolved two radically different strategies to inhibit the RIG-I pathway. Whereas RVFV inhibits IFN induction by expressing a dedicated anti-IFN factor, the non-structural protein NSs [102], [103]. CCHFV removes the RIG-I ligand from its genome. Other bunyaviruses fall into the same categories, e.g. La Crosse virus expresses an NSs protein blocking IFN induction [4], but Hantaan virus contains a monophosphate on its genome 5\u2032-end [101], [104].",

            "text": "Nonetheless, IFN-activating structures other than RNA seem to be present in CCHFV particles, and the virus possesses also at least one anti-IFN factor. Experiments using UV irradiation revealed that the IRF-3-dependent ISG56 gene is weakly activated by UV-inactivated CCHFV particles at an early time point after infection [100]. IRF-3-activated ISG56 upregulation by enveloped viral particles is described to occur by an unknown, TLR- and RIG-I-independent, signal pathway [105], [106]. In cells infected with intact virus, by contrast, ISG56 upregulation occurred with a delay of 14 h. In line with this, intact virus delays the activation of IRF-3, assayed by measuring its nuclear translocation, by approximately 20 h [100]. This indicates that CCHFV expresses a factor which counteracts IRF-3 activation and hence ISG56 upregulation. The factor is not known so far, but sequence analyses suggest that CCHFV has the capacity to encode an additional gene on the S segment (data not shown). The corresponding protein product has yet to be identified. Besides this, it has been demonstrated that the L protein of CCHFV contains an ovarian tumor (OTU) domain allowing innate immune evasion [107]. This domain is also present on the L protein of the related Nairoviruses Dugbe virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus, but not of the phylogenetically more distant Phlebovirus RVFV. The OTU domain represents a superfamily of Ubiquitin (Ub)-deconjugating proteases found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ub and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) are short proteins which are covalently conjugated to other proteins and mediate innate antiviral responses. Frias-Staheli et al. showed that the OTU domain-containing proteases from CCHFV and related Nairoviruses deconjugate Ub and ISG15 from cellular target proteins [107]. Moreover, expression of a viral OTU domain-containing protein antagonizes the antiviral effects of ISG15 and inhibits NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling.",

            "text": "Viral strategies to antagonize the innate immune response are usually not perfect and mostly delay rather than completely suppress the IFN system [41], [58] A common suggested feature of agents causing hemorrhagic fever is the deregulation of host immune responses by combating and attacking cells involved in initiation of antiviral responses. The existing knowledge concerning CCHF emanates from autopsies and clinical findings. The primary pathophysiological events appear to be leakage of erythrocytes and plasma through the vasculature into tissues [13]. Endothelial damage can contribute to coagulopathy by deregulated stimulation of platelet aggregation, which in turn activates the intrinsic coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to clotting factor deficiency causing hemorrhages. For CCHFV, vascular leakage may be caused either by destruction of endothelial cells or by a disruption of the tight junctions which constitute the endothelial barrier between cells. Moreover, it is unclear whether these events are a direct consequence of infection or whether virus-induced host factors cause the endothelial dysfunction [108]. However, in an epithelial cell line model CCHFV neither caused disruption of tight junctions nor necrosis or apoptosis of cells [109]. This could suggest that the hemorrhages and coagulation disturbances may be caused indirectly, possibly by high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In fact, for other hemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola and Dengue virus there is a correlation between the strength of the proinflammatory response, vascular leakage, and disease severity [84], [90], [110], [111], [112]. Key players in disease progression are the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [111]. It has been shown that yellow fever patients with fatal outcome had high levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [113]. In another study, early elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-1 beta in Ebola virus-infected patient correlated with non-fatal outcome, whereas release of IL-10 and high levels of neopterin and IL-RA in the plasma correlated with fatal outcomes [114]\n. Recently, Ergonul and coworkers demonstrated significantly higher level of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in CCHFV patients with fatal outcome compared to the non-fatal cases [38]. Another observation was a correlation between high levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 to the onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients. However, elevated levels of IL-10 were not observed in these patients and the levels of IL-10 were negatively correlated to the DIC scores. In another study, Papa et al. confirmed that high TNF-\u03b1 levels are correlated with severity of CCHF disease, but they suggested that IL-6 could be found in both mild and severe cases [115]. The only fatal case in this study had high levels of both IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 compared to non-fatal cases. Another interesting observation is elevated levels of Neopterin in patients with Dengue fever or Ebola hemorrhagic fever [114], [116]. Neopterin derivates are produced by macrophages and dendritic cells upon stimulation by IFNs [117]. Neopterin is a useful tool to assess the intensity of cell-mediated immune response [117] and a recent study indeed noted a correlation between elevated levels of neopterin in CCHFV patients and disease severity [39].",

            "text": "Research on CCHFV is hampered by several constraints. Firstly, work with the virus requires BSL-4 containment facilities, the highest security standard possible. Secondly, there is no animal model which mimics human disease, and thirdly, CCHF cases occur so sporadically that clinical samples are rare. Using the available systems, however, some of the most pressing questions on CCHFV should be addressed in the near future:-What is the molecular pattern eliciting IRF-3 activation by CCHFV? Treatment of fibroblasts with UV-irradiated virus particles activates IRF-3. As the genome of CCHFV lacks a 5\u2032 triphosphate group to trigger RIG-I and IRF-3 [101], other structures, e.g. the viral enveloped particles or the nucleocapsids must be recognized by the infected cell.-Which TLRs are involved in CCHFV recognition and cytokine induction in vivo?-Can DCs be infected, and what is their role in the cytokine response to CCHFV?-Is there an NSs-like gene suppressing IFN and cytokine induction? For bunyaviruses of the genera Orthobunyavirus and Phleboviruses, e.g. La Crosse virus, Bunyamwera virus, and Rift Valley fever virus, a non-structural protein encoded on the S segment (NSs) is known to strongly suppress transcriptional activation of IFNs and other inducible genes [4], [5], [118], [119]. Moreover, some members of the Hantavirus genus also encode an NSs protein which weakly supresses IFN induction [8], [120]. Moreover, for Hantaviruses it is known that the glycoproteins can interfere with IFN induction [121], [122]. The delay of IRF-3 activation observed in productively infected cells indicates that CCHFV encodes proteins or domains dedicated to counteract IFN induction.-Does CCHFV interfere with IFN signalling, and if so, which viral gene product is responsible? IFN is effective if given in advance, but not if given at 1 h after infection [100]. It is therefore conceivable that CCHFV is capable of shutting down the JAK/STAT pathway.-Which ISGs contribute to the inhibition of CCHFV by IFNs? Other ISGs besides MxA and perhaps PKR and ISG20 may be efficient in blocking various steps of CCHFV replication.-What is the role of the OTU domain in pathogenesis? There is currently no reverse genetics system available to generate infectious viruses from cloned cDNA plasmids. Mutational inactivation of the OTU domain, rescue of the respective virus and a phenotypical comparison with the wild-type virus can reveal the contribution of the OTU domain to virus replication in cell culture and in vivo.-How does the virus cause vascular leakage? As it has been mentioned, the endothelium can be targeted in two ways \u2013 indirectly by virus-mediated host-derived factors that cause endothelial dysfunction, and/or directly by virus infection in endothelial cells. Recent studies demonstrate that increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are correlated with disease severity [38], suggesting that the endothelial damage may be due to a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. To date, there is no experimental studies investigating whether the virus replication cycle per se or whether it is cytokines, which damage the tight junctions of endothelial cells.\n",

The recognition receptor RIG-I does not bind to 5\u2032monophosphorylated ssRNA and is hence unable to trigger an IFN response. Like other negative-strand RNA viruses, CCHFV most likely does not produce significant amounts of dsRNA, thus rendering the RIG-I, MDA5 and PKR pathways inactive. PKR is possibly nonetheless activated, either by trace amounts of dsRNA or by cell stress resulting from infection.
