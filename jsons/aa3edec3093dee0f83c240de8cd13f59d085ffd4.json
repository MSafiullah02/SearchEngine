Being now in the contagion reduction phase, we are starting to work on the restart of the activities (Phase 2). Although the number of endoscopic examinations to be rescheduled is currently not foreseeable, since the restart of normal activities has not been established yet, also the modality of rescheduling the canceled exams, that will be delegated to the Endoscopy Services, is included in the preparation of Phase 2 management. As concerns the strategies to adopt, one could be to extend the working hours of the Endoscopy Services. However, this is likely unrealistic, as it implies the need for additional healthcare personnel and economic resources in a time where financial resources are limited. Postponing all the already scheduled procedures in order to give priority to the cancelled ones might be another option, but this strategy carries the risk of deferring a procedure which has been correctly schedule, favoring another procedure that does not need any priority. Therefore, the strategy of rescheduling the appointments based on the stratification of the procedure indication might represent a valuable and reasonable alternative. Hereby we describe the policy we are adopting in our Endoscopy Service.",

In the first group we arbitrarily included exams required for symptoms of recent onset (4-6 weeks). In the nTS group we included the following two sub-groups; sub-group A: chronic symptoms or post-polypectomy surveillance for high risk lesions, according to published guidelines (2), or for any dysplastic lesion in the upper GI tract (i.e. dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, or advance stages of gastritis with dysplasia), sub-group B: postpolypectomy surveillance for low risk lesions and for screening, or surveillance of an upper GI preneoplastic risk condition but without dysplasia. The rationale was to identify a priority scale to be used to reorganize the timetable for the Phase 2.",

In the first 4 weeks of lockdown, we have canceled 232 colonoscopies, 183 gastroscopies and 15 endoscopic ultrasound (we are continuing to perform oncological endoscopic ultrasound). According with the proposed strategy of rescheduling, we categorized as TS procedures 58 colonoscopies and 57 gastroscopies, whereas we had nTS 174 colonoscopies (50 and 124 in the sub-group A and B, respectively) and 126 gastroscopies (104 and 22 in the sub-group A and B, respectively). Considering our usual daily agenda and the gradual resumption of activity, we should be able to allocate all the canceled procedures categorized within 3-4 months from the previous appointment, also in relation to the estimates for the start of phase 2 (probably within 2 weeks) .",

Therefore, this strategy appears to be reasonable, balancing the risks of missing lesions and the need not to overload the Endoscopy Services and not to put the staff at risk of contagion. In the other hand, this policy would like to offer the great opportunity to improve the appropriateness of the procedure in an open access system. Upon resumption of activity, we will systematically record the effective appropriateness of the both rescheduled and already planned procedures to check the effectiveness of the proposed policy.",
