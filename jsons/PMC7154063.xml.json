Since then, cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, highlighting concern of a global outbreak [2]. The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases have been reported as of March 1. Of them, 183 were in the National Capital Region of Manila, of whom many were admitted to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH) in Manila, the national infectious disease referral hospital [3, 4]. We describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, including the first death outside China.",

It was reported that he was in contact with someone that was unwell in Wuhan, but not that he had visited the seafood market. During January 20 to 25, they travelled from Wuhan via Hong Kong to several locations in the Philippines (Fig. 2). Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, developed cough and sore throat on January 21. Due to persistence of symptoms of patient 2, they travelled to Manila on January 25. In Manila, patient 2 was denied entry to a hotel because he was febrile and both patients were transferred to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH), the national referral hospital for infectious diseases [4]. On admission, patient 2 was classified as a COVID-19 person under investigation (PUI) based on his travel history and fever [2] and was transferred to a designated isolation area with negative pressure rooms. Patient 1 did not fit the PUI criteria due to absence of fever, but was also isolated because of possible exposure.\n",

Patient 2 tested positive for COVID-19, Influenza B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, all of which can cause respiratory infection and severe pneumonia. Unfortunately, sputum culture was not possible due to biosafety concerns. It is unclear which pathogen was the leading cause of death, but previous research has shown that outcomes of acute viral respiratory infection are worse if multiple pathogens are present [9].
