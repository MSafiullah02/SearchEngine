            "text": "As an old member in the family of Chinese herbs, bupleurum root has been used for more than 2000 years. It is primarily used to treat cold fevers, chills and fevers along with congestion and stuffiness in the chest and hypochondria. The extracts of bupleurum contain many active components such as volatile oil, polysaccharide, flavonoid and saikosaponins, which exhibit a broad range of biological functions [3], [4], [5] and serve a wide variety of harmonizing activities. The main medical uses of saikosaponins are anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatitis and anti-tumor. Saikosaponins were obtained through traditional extraction methods, which were extremely time consuming and material wasting. The majority of previous studies focused on the types of saikosaponins and the analysis of their structures [6], [7]. In recent years, many published reports have shown that the use of ultrasound leads to an increase in the yield of various phytochemicals [8], [9], [10]. When ultrasound is applied, a large amount of bubbles are generated in a liquid medium. When agitated by intense ultrasound, they oscillate violently, undergo initial explosive growth and subsequently collapse [11]. Because there is limited \u201cspace\u201d for them to expand, most of the bubbles collapse asymmetrically in the vessels, and the inside of bubble can reach thousands of bar in pressure and Kelvin in temperature. Extraction can be significantly improved with the aid of an ultrasound wave.",

The raise was then leveled when sonication was prolonged. Such a trend was similar for all three saikosaponins, and thus the total saikosaponins as well. Ultrasound facilitated the release of saikosaponins inside the plant cells to the exterior solvent and gave a large yield at the early stage of extraction. The rinsing effect may release most of the saikosaponins in the broken cells at the first 30 min. Furthermore, as the diffusion front moved towards the interior of the tissues, the diffusion area reduced, diffusion distance increased and the diffusion rate would decrease accordingly. Therefore, there was no obvious observed yield change in the prolonged time periods. Based on these results, the optimum sonication time was set for 30 min for later experiments.",

Previous researches had shown that as temperature approached the boiling point of the solution, ineffective sonication occurred as a result of the decrease in surface tension and increase in vapor pressure with microbubbles, which in turn caused the damping of the ultrasonic wave. To fully investigate the effect of ultrasound on extraction, the temperature of the extraction mixture was kept below its boiling point. As shown in Fig. 5\n, the higher the temperature, the larger the extraction yield obtained at a given time. It was well proved that the extraction rate of most compounds increased with temperature. Thus, the diffusion of active components was intensified when temperature increased, so was the extraction yield at a fixed time period. Thus, 80 \u00b0C was chosen as the optimum temperature.",

Saikosaponin-c remained in a relative low level and increased with the power applied. Because saikosaponin-a was the dominant component in the herb, the total saikosaponins showed a trend similar to it. The difference between the yield with and without ultrasound power was also presented in this figure. For the given conditions, there was an approximate 33% increase in the yield of total saikosaponins at a power of 21 W compared with that at 0 W. The power output of the ultrasound generator was directly related to the intensity of the ultrasound in the medium. Thus, an increase in the power output would bring about an increase in the extraction yield. However, a power too high would cause an increase in the bubble numbers in the solvent during cavitation, which might reduce the efficiency of the ultrasound energy transmitted into the medium [13]. After 21 W, the curve for power effect on the yield of extraction became plain. Therefore, sonication power of 21 W was seen to be suitable for the extraction.",

As expected, when the particle size decreased, the extraction rate for all saikosaponins increased (Fig. 7\n). However, saikosaponins-a and c showed a trend that a further decrease in size would not result in a further increase in the extraction yield. For a fixed weight of material, the surface area increased as the particle size decreased. For the particle in size range of 0.45\u20130.9 mm, diffusion may play a significant role so that the yield at a given time would be expected to increase with the reduction of size, as the surface area increasing. However, when the particle size was small enough, most of the cells were ruptured by the application of ultrasound, and diffusion would not be a significant step in the extraction of such small particles, so that a further decrease in the size would not result in a corresponding increase in the extraction rate. This hypothesis was supported by our experimental results for the size change from 0.3\u20130.45 to <0.3 mm, and Mason's report [14]. Consequently the particle size range of 0.3\u20130.45 mm was chosen.",
