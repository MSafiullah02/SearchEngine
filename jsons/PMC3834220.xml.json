            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus is endemic among wild birds and there are ongoing cases of avian-to-human infection, mostly in Southeast Asia. Since 2003, a total of 358 deaths out of 607 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported (WHO, 2012). Although human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has been rare so far, recent studies have shown that some avian H5N1 strains only require a few mutations to acquire the capacity for airborne transmission between mammals, thereby constituting a major threat for human health (Herfst et al., 2012, Imai et al., 2012). Given the high mortality associated with H5N1 infection and the risk of an impending influenza pandemic, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of viral pathogenesis in order to better manage patient care and develop more effective antiviral therapeutics. H5N1 pathogenesis has been extensively studied, but even with the sum of current knowledge, we still lack a quantitative model of molecular events leading to disease at the organismal level. Systems biology allows examination of host\u2013pathogen interactions at several scales, including the whole organism, the target organ, and the cellular level. We believe this approach holds promise to building models that are able to handle known information about H5N1 and to discover emergent properties of H5N1\u2013host interactions that appear when the system is considered as a whole. The goal of such a model is to reveal major regulators of H5N1 pathogenesis and predict the effect of their disruption on disease outcome, which in turn would accelerate development of novel immunomodulatory therapeutics. In this review, we describe the contribution of \u2019omic studies to our comprehension of H5N1 pathogenesis, the goal of systems biology in H5N1 research, and the different data and models that need to be developed to help reach that goal.",

The mouse genome was sequenced 10 years ago (Waterston et al., 2002) and is now extremely well annotated, thanks to several international collaborative projects such as FANTOM (Okazaki et al., 2002), the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (Skarnes et al., 2011) and the Collaborative Cross (Churchill et al., 2004). In general, this animal model is thought to reflect H5N1 human disease (Lu et al., 1999, Maines et al., 2005). Human H5N1 isolates are highly pathogenic in mice without prior adaptation, in part due to preferential recognition of avian-type \u03b12,3 sialic acid (SA) receptors predominantly expressed in the mouse respiratory tract (Ibricevic et al., 2006). Cilloniz et al. (2010) showed that early activation of inflammatory response genes correlate with disease severity during A/Viet Nam/1203/2005 (H5N1) virus (VN1203) infection, including increased expression of inflammasome components and genes associated with viral sensing, neutrophil activation, NF-\u03baB signaling, and chemokine signaling. In mice, VN1203 disseminates into brain and spleen tissues, and genes associated with extrapulmonary dissemination were associated with sustained activation of inflammatory responses and altered hematological function and lipoxin signaling.",

            "text": "An enhanced and early inflammatory response has been observed in all animal models infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 or 1918 H1N1 influenza viruses (Baskin et al., 2009, Cameron et al., 2008, Chang et al., 2011, Cilloniz et al., 2010, Cill\u00f3niz et al., 2009, Shinya et al., 2012), which would argue that the same pathways may be activated after infection with lethal and non-lethal viruses, but only at a higher magnitude and with different kinetics for the lethal virus infections. However, infection with non-lethal viruses may also induce different protective pathways, as cell growth or lipid metabolism pathways, which would then allow the animal to clear the virus and recover from infection (Cameron et al., 2008, Go et al., 2012, Josset et al., 2012a). In a meta-analysis of mouse host responses that considered different mouse genetic backgrounds and different respiratory viruses with varying levels of pathogenicity, Chang et al. (2011) identified two different types of gene signatures differentiating high and low pathogenicity viruses. One gene signature had anti-correlated expression in the two virus groups; genes up-regulated by highly pathogenic viruses were associated with inflammation and apoptosis, while down-regulated genes were associated with cytochrome P450 pathway. The second gene signature involved genes that had magnitude differences in their levels of expression, with mainly chemokines that were more up-regulated after infection with highly pathogenic viruses. In this study, the \u2018magnitude\u2019 signature differentiated the two virus groups the best and it was also a better predictor for distinguishing lethal vs. non-lethal influenza infection. However, these signatures were derived using the two groups of viruses regardless of time post-infection, and may therefore have missed temporal transitional differences contributing to pathogenesis.",

The PB2 protein is one of three subunits of the viral polymerase and the residue at position 627 is one of the best characterized viral determinants of host range and virulence (Boivin et al., 2010). An H5N1 virus from the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong possessing lysine at position 627 (627K), A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK483), was found to be lethal in mice, whereas an H5N1 virus that contained a glutamic acid residue at this position, A/Hong Kong/486/97 (HK486), was non-lethal (Hatta et al., 2001). Fornek et al. (2009) investigated how the presence of lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein affects the host response to H5N1 in lung and spleen. Increased pathogenicity and dissemination was observed for HK483 and HK486 PB2-E627K viruses, which was associated with enhanced viral replication, activation of immune, inflammatory and apoptosis responses and also the lack of induction of genes required for TCR signaling in the lung. In the spleen, genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity, antigen presentation and interferon (IFN) signaling were more highly induced in response to HK483 and HK486 PB2-E627K viruses compared to HK486 (Fornek et al., 2009).",

(2011)). Deletion of PB1-F2 diminished the pathogenicity of mouse-adapted H1N1 in mice (Zamarin et al., 2006), whereas a single N66S mutation in PB1-F2 of Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) resulted in increased virulence of mouse-adapted A/WSN/1933 (H1N1; WSN) virus expressing PB1-F2 N66S of H5N1 virus (Conenello et al., 2007). Global pulmonary transcriptional profiling of C57BL/6J mice infected with reassortant PB1-F2 66N or 66S variants revealed that increased pathogenicity of the 66S variant was associated with a delayed induction of innate immune responses at 1 dpi, and after 3 dpi, increased expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines could be responsible for the higher trafficking of monocytes and granulocytes into the mouse lung (Conenello et al., 2011). Deletion of PB1-F2 from WSN is associated with decreased virulence in mice and a decrease in host responses, in particular genes linked to cell death, inflammatory response and neutrophil chemotaxis, with minimal impact on viral replication (Le Goffic et al., 2011).",

Other types of \u2019omics might bring different insights on H5N1 pathogenesis. For instance, influenza viruses also modulate post-transcriptional regulation and translation, which cannot be addressed by transcriptomics alone, but requires integration of proteomic data and regulatory RNA profiling. At a lower complexity level, studies at the single molecule level, such as interaction between the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and SA cellular receptors or neuraminidase (NA) enzymatic activity, also provide an understanding of H5N1 virulence (Fig. 2\n). Aside from the molecular dimension, studies on H5N1-host interactions also need to include the different levels of physiological scales of the host response, from the single infected cell to the lung to the organism. In addition, the time scales that span these physiological levels are very different, from milliseconds for the induction of a signaling cascade or protein-protein interactions, to minutes and hours for the induction of the expression of antiviral genes, to days and weeks for the development of innate immunity and transition to adaptive immune responses. Finally, a fourth dimension that is crucial in shaping the host response to H5N1 infection is host genetics. This parameter can be studied from the single gene level, using approaches like RNA interference or single gene knock-out (KO) mice, to multifactorial levels of complexity that are present in the human genome and the natural genetic variation can be studied in a mouse resource called the Collaborative Cross (CC). The recognition that we cannot predict the behavior of a living organism by looking at biological properties individually is bringing the field of systems biology to the forefront of infectious disease research.",

A pull-down study of H5N1 PA coupled with mass spectrometry identified new partners of the viral polymerase and in particular, PA was found to be associated with mitochondrial proteins such as the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIFM1), suggesting a potential role of PA during apoptosis (Bradel-Tretheway et al., 2011). Another strategy to identify host factors interacting with viral proteins is to use the yeast two-hybrid system (Shapira et al., 2009, Tafforeau et al., 2011). In particular, Tafforeau et al. (2011) used this system to identify several partners of H5N1 polymerase subunits. However, the approach is limited by a general high rate of false positives and the caveat of protein interactions not taking place in a relevant cellular context. Finally, advances in phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry now enable high-throughput identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation sites, yet no phosphoproteomic data are published for influenza infected cells. Such data would provide information about signal transduction activated early after infection and would be useful to connect infection to further changes in transcriptional profiles in cells.",

Measurement of extracellular metabolites from central carbon metabolism (glucose, lactate, glutamine and glutamate) and the concentration of 30 intracellular metabolites from the glycolysis, pentose-phosphate-pathway and TCA cycle from MDCK cells infected by a mouse-adapted H1N1 laboratory strain, PR8, showed an increase of glycolysis after infection (Ritter et al., 2010). In a more high-throughput manner, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was employed to profile metabolites from cell lines infected with influenza A/Hong Kong/2108/2003 (H9N2) virus, and the results indicated that infection can alter fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism (Lin et al., 2010). Several transcriptomic studies also suggest that lipid metabolism is altered during influenza infection in vivo and could be implicated in increased pathogenesis of H1N1 (Josset et al., 2012a, Ma et al., 2011). However there is no metabolic profiling of infected tissue published yet, nor are there metabolomic data for H5N1 virus, though we are currently generating metabolomics data on cell lines infected with VN1203 from similar samples on which transcriptomic and proteomic are available, therefore allowing an integration of these data types. Given the importance of the inflammatory response in H5N1 pathogenesis, the profiling of lipids with pro- or anti-inflammatory effects could be important for better characterizing viral-host interactions and for developing potential immunotherapies.",

Viruses used for these screens included PR8 and a second mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus, WSN, as well as a modified influenza virus in which HA was replaced with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G and NA was replaced with a reporter for use in an orthologous system (Hao et al., 2008). There was little overlap of identified factors among the different screens, which could be explained by differences in systems and readouts. Nevertheless, considering these factors as a whole could be important in modeling H5N1-host interactions. Several reviews and a commentary have been dedicated to understanding the importance of these results and provide more detail on host factors regulating influenza virus replication (Mehle and Doudna, 2010, Stertz and Shaw, 2011, Watanabe et al., 2010).",

Predicted target genes of these miRNAs encoded cell death and inflammatory factors involved in influenza pathogenesis, which suggest that their regulation could play crucial roles in influenza virulence (Li et al., 2011). In mice, 45 miRNAs were differentially expressed in lung samples from different mouse strains during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (MA15) or influenza virus (PR8) infection and expression of 6 miRNAs was confirmed to change after VN1203 infection (Peng et al., 2011).

While this dual RNA-Seq has been mostly used for bacterial or parasite sequencing, together with the host (Westermann et al., 2012); it is directly applicable for influenza and cellular mRNA profiling, as influenza mRNA is polyadenylated. On the other hand, directional total RNA-Seq allows access to both vRNA and viral mRNA sequences, together with host RNA. An illustration of the importance of considering both viral sequence evolution and host response to fully model pathogenesis comes from studying the PB2-627E viral mutant. Performing total RNA-Seq analysis of lung from mice infected with 104\n pfu of VN1203 carrying the PB2-627E mutation revealed that around half of the viral population had reverted back to the wild-type sequence by day 2 pi (unpublished data). These data are crucial to interpret the host-transcriptome response. Differences in magnitude and kinetic of induction of the inflammatory response by the wild-type and mutant virus may likely be more a function of difference in viral dosage and time than related to the specific PB2-627E mutation (Tchitchek et al., submitted for publication).",

This method could be used for H5N1 transcriptomic and phenotypic data to define how gene-regulatory networks are associated with particular phenotypes. Phenotypic data usually measured in mice to evaluate influenza infection include weight loss, histology and viral lung titers. Because lung pathology is an important determinant of H5N1 outcome, longitudinal measurements of lung function during experimental infection by plethysmography represents one valuable technique to measure respiratory variability. Such measurements were used to monitor mice after 2009 H1N1 infection and were found to correlate with lung pathology (Julander et al., 2011). Assessing associations between such phenotypic parameters and \u2019omic data could bring meaningful insights into how H5N1 pathogenesis is regulated.",

Attempting a direct correlation between proteomic and transcriptomic data is extremely challenging because of multiple layers of possible discrepancies. These include distinct sensitivities of cDNA array hybridization and peptide measurement, different biases in the two technologies (Ghazalpour et al., 2011), timing differences between transcription and translation, or post-transcriptional and translational modifications. It is interesting to note that influenza virus modifies both transcriptional and translational regulation by cap-snatching (Plotch et al., 1981), interaction with the cellular RNA polymerase II (Engelhardt et al., 2005) and spliceosome components (Wolff et al., 1998), and by ribosomal recruitment (Kash et al., 2002, Kash et al., 2006). Therefore, looking at the correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data could provide additional value into influenza virus-mediated translational control. In Calu-3 cells infected with VN1203, Pearson correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that very early (0\u20133 hpi) up-regulated proteins and late (12\u201324 hpi) downregulated proteins changed in abundance without regulation of their transcript (Eisfeld et al., in review). These anti-correlations could be driven by viral targeting of the mRNA or translation machinery; however, consideration of additional levels of mRNA regulation, such as miRNA and isoform quantification, would be necessary to fully model the system.",

A recent review argues that use of prior biological knowledge is crucial to increase signal detection in systems biology (Ideker and Krogan, 2012). However, if prior assumptions on signal distribution can lead to development of effective statistics for integrating \u2019omics (for example Kislinger et al., 2006), most of the reductionist knowledge about H5N1 cannot be directly integrated into systems biology models. Why might this be the case? Let us consider a viral factor V interacting with a host protein H, this interaction may have been published in a paper, but, most of the time, it is described in qualitative terms and for a specific biological condition. However, we need to know precisely when this interaction V\u2013H occurs, with what affinity and which system. An example of cases of such known interactions between viral and host-factors are the binding of HA or NA and cellular SA receptors, which affinities can be modeled using Michaelis\u2013Menten equations. Even if some models can consider known dependencies between molecules in terms of qualitative interaction as prior knowledge to integrate \u2018omics\u2019 (Choi and Pavelka, 2012), these data still need to be grouped in a database that can be queried automatically. Quantitative data relevant for influenza pathogenesis include microarray data, siRNA screen data, and virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions (PPI), which can be downloaded from the literature, or public repositories (e.g. GEO or SRA). Given the importance of immune cell infiltration into the lung toward H5N1 pathogenesis, datasets from other sources to consider include the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) for immune cells subsets (Heng et al., 2008), the Mouse Gene Atlas for specific mouse tissues (Su et al., 2004), and the Immune Response In Silico (IRIS) database for humans (Abbas et al., 2005).",

Gene lists derived from statistical analysis have traditionally been used for functional enrichment analysis. More recently, we and others have used datasets from immune cell subsets to relate genes differentially expressed after vaccination (Nakaya et al., 2011), or infection (Josset et al., 2012a, Josset et al., 2012b) with specific immune cells. By using a similar analysis, we show in Fig. 4\nthat up-regulated genes after VN1203 infection were related to infiltration with specific immune cell subsets. Especially, VN1203 induced early expression of genes associated with activated DC and granulocytes, and genes specific to T cell and activated macrophages later in infection. In contrast, genes induced by the lower pathogen A/California/04/09 (H1N1) were associated with activated DC and macrophages only after day 4, and to a more limited extent. Moreover, prior biological knowledge could also be used to integrate \u2019omics data to better model H5N1 infection, as performed with phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic data in a yeast system (Huang and Fraenkel, 2009).",

Simple systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been used to describe in vitro influenza viral growth (Beauchemin et al., 2008, Heldt et al., 2012, M\u00f6hler et al., 2005, Sidorenko and Reichl, 2004). While these models gave important insight into viral replication properties, they did not consider activation of cellular pathways. Quantitatively assessing cellular pathway activation together with viral replication is difficult and has not extensively been studied to date. The activation of the P58IPK pathway and its effect on viral replication have been described using a simple set of ODEs, but this model was limited due to variations in 3 host proteins (Goodman et al., 2011). Describing the dynamical behavior of several (or ideally, all) cellular pathways is crucial for modeling H5N1 disease, yet extremely challenging as it requires high-quality data on kinetic parameters. Dynamical modeling it has been applied to only a few simple systems, such as the bacterial SOS DNA repair system (Ronen et al., 2002). Recently, methods combining co-regulation network inference and ODE have been applied to simulate cell-wide regulatory network dynamics for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wang et al., 2011); but whether such methods are applicable to more complex organisms remains to be shown. Modelers will have to take a more prominent role in driving experimental designs to be able to generate sufficient data for building dynamical models. In addition to constructing transcriptomic-based models, collecting quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic data for H5N1-infected cells will be important for inferring dynamic representation of signaling pathways, similar to what was done for modeling the MAPK signaling pathway for example (Schoeberl et al., 2002, Hornberg et al., 2005).",

Arguably, the potential importance for performing SCA of infected cells is based on studies of NF-\u03baB activation patterns after TNF\u03b1 stimulation. Notably, SCA revealed that NF-\u03baB activation follows an oscillation pattern (Nelson et al., 2004) and is heterogeneous with a digital process at the single-cell level (Tay et al., 2010). This dynamic is not apparent when analyzing NF-\u03baB activation averaged over the entire population. As NF-\u03baB is a major transcription factor controlling the host response to H5N1 infection (Schmolke et al., 2009), analysis of infected single cells could be important to more precisely model the virus-host dynamic. In theory, recent advances in sequencing and MS technologies have made it possible to analyze the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome from a single cell (reviewed in Fritzsch et al., 2012). In the near future, performing SCA on H5N1 infected cells will most likely reveal important insights in specific dynamics of the host response to this virus.",

Recently, Canini and Carrat (2011) combined structural equations and a statistical model fitted to H1N1 human data to characterize the dynamics of the infection, immune response, and illness in humans. These studies provide a quantitative understanding of the host immune response in controlling influenza virus replication, though the approach has not been applied specifically to H5N1 datasets. It would be particularly interesting to compare parameters derived from data from low-pathogenic viruses with data from H5N1 viruses, which could suggest molecular events responsible for the excessive virulence of H5N1. Experimental data in mice suggests the rapid replication of H5N1 overwhelms the immune response, especially the CD8+ T cell response that is otherwise protective, and in turn, kills the host by direct cytopathic effects (Hatta et al., 2010). It would be informative to model the relations between viral replication, CD8+ T cell responses and pathology in mice to understand these events more quantitatively.",

It is clear from studies of H5N1 pathogenesis that viral tropism (lower vs. upper respiratory tract) is crucial to determine virulence (Nicholls et al., 2007). In addition, host response after infection with H5N1 depends on the type and differentiation state of respiratory cells (Chan et al., 2010). Currently, in vivo \u2019omic studies have almost solely focused on analyzing whole lung tissue. From these studies, it is difficult to determine which cell types largely contribute to the host response and whether the microenvironment impacts this response. Similar cells from precise infectious foci in lung could be selected by using laser capture microdissection (LCM), an effective technique for harvesting pure cell populations from tissue sections. For instance, microarray profiling of LCM-selected stromal and epithelial compartments during breast cancer progression was used to study how the tumor environment drives tumorigenesis (Ma et al., 2009). Moreover, protocols for performing microproteomics on LCM-selected cells are available (Roulhac et al., 2011). Applied to H5N1 studies, LCM coupled with the sensitivity of RNA-Seq could allow transcriptomic profiling of infected cells, as well as surrounding immune and epithelial cells. Such data would open modeling approaches to analysis of cell-to-cell interactions and better define the impact of each cell type during H5N1 pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Where are foci of infection in lung? At what rate do immune cells infiltrate the lung? Are these parameters related to outcome? Recent technology advances in live-animal imaging make it possible to analyze in real-time immune cell circulation and cellular movement in the mouse lung. Two-photon imaging of live mouse lung has shown trafficking of immune cells in pulmonary capillaries in real-time (Looney et al., 2010). This technique was able to measure the transit and velocity of neutrophils and na\u00efve and activated T cells in normal lung and after intratracheal challenge with MIP-2 or LPS. The migratory activity measures represent important parameters that could be used to model behavior of immune cells in mouse lung. Manicassamy et al. (2010) have reported on the use of a recombinant PR8 NS1-GFP virus to monitor whole lung dynamics of influenza infection. They showed infection in the respiratory tract starts in areas close to large conducting airways and later spreads to deeper sections of the lungs. However, this imaging was done on excised lung at 4 dpi and not in real-time on live animals due to high background fluorescence (Manicassamy et al., 2010). This virus could be used with the two-photon imaging system described by Looney et al. (2010) to determine more in-depth infection rate parameters of different parts of the respiratory tract and ultimately, the traffick patterns of infected cells throughout the lung and in the periphery of the living organism. Alternatively, as signal-to-background is notably greater with bioluminescence than fluorescence, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) could be used to determine dynamics of influenza infection, given that construction of influenza virus expressing the luciferase reporter gene is possible, as demonstrated with Sindbis virus (Cook and Griffin, 2003). Interestingly, BLI has been used to quantify NF-\u03baB activation (Le Goffic et al., 2011) or IFN response (Pulverer et al., 2010) in live mouse lung after influenza infection. Through the use of these imaging techniques in live animals after H5N1 infection, we could begin to generate maps of whole mouse lung showing in real-time the localization and extent of infection within the lung and the dynamics of the immune response more precisely, which could then be used to model spatial and temporal responses to H5N1 virus.",

            "text": "\nRule-based computational models, such as agent-based models (ABM) and cellular automata (CA), represent interesting models that could be used to investigate spatial aspects and cell-to-cell communication during H5N1 infection. CA models are dynamic simulation models where cell transitions are based on the state of the current cell and the states of neighboring cells, while in ABM, the model consists of a set of autonomous agents that interact with each other and the environment, taking into account actions according to a set of logical rules. Studies by Beauchemin et al. (2005) and Baccam et al. (2006) used a simple two-dimensional CA model consisting of fixed epithelial cells and mobile immune cells to model an infection with influenza A virus. In this model, initial spatial distribution of infected cells had an important effect on outcome of infection. Recently, a CA model was used together with ODEs fitted to viral titers observed in primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells to estimate virus productivity per cell and viral spread through the cell monolayer (Mitchell et al., 2011). These models, however, did not model how the different infiltrating immune cells interact with each other and with infected epithelial cells. ABM and CA have been largely used in immunology to represent cell-to-cell interactions that occur during the immune response (for a review, see (Chavali et al., 2008). For instance, Folcik et al. (2011) have developed an ABM of the immune system with representations of the immune and tissue cells as agents, cytokines, chemokines, or pathogens as signals, and parenchymal tissue, secondary lymphoid tissue and the lymphatic circulation as three virtual zones. Using this model the authors found that dendritic cells acted as hubs in the immune system network after challenge. Such a model has not been developed for influenza virus to date, but developing a model for H5N1 may help to elucidate which cytokines determine immune cell infiltration into the lung as well as which immune cells act as key players of immunopathology. Such a model could also simulate the effect of disrupting a specific signal or cell on the infection dynamics.",

Transcriptomic profiling of sorted cells from blood has been done by several laboratories (Nakaya et al., 2011, Novershtern et al., 2011).

One current challenge is to elucidate how signaling networks studied in an in vitro cell culture system relate to in vivo organ networks, as well as whether models trained on data from infected cells can accurately predict outcome of the whole organism. This has been suggested from a multivariate modeling approach that identified similarities in transcriptional responses to H5N1 virus in the lungs of mice and macaques infected with H5N1 virus, and human lung epithelial cells (McDermott et al., 2011). Given H5N1 systemic dissemination, studying the response of other organs and modeling systemic inflammation might also be necessary to predict disease outcome.",

            "text": "To bridge in vivo and in vitro models and build a global model of H5N1 infection, we need to apply methods that can link models at different spatial scales and over different temporal scales. Multiscale models have received greater interest in the past few years (Meier-Schellersheim et al., 2009) but they have not been applied to H5N1 systems to date. A few modeling platforms have been developed that can handle the coordination of coupled models whose component modules may be expressed using different formalisms (e.g., EBM, CA, ABM, or other discrete approaches) (see the review of Sloot and Hoekstra (2010) for multiscale models). Several studies concerning other respiratory diseases could be of interest for future H5N1 applications. As an example of disruption of lung function, one model that bridges three different spatial scales has been developed for simulating pulmonary gas exchange during hepatopulmonary syndrome (Chakraborty et al., 2007). As an example of multiscale modeling of host-pathogen interaction in the lung, Fallahi-Sichani et al. (2011) developed a model that combined ABM to represent cellular and tissue scale events and ODE to represent the single-cell molecular scale during granuloma formation in lung after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. This 2D model does not take into account the structure of the lung and considers only a set of cells relevant for Mtb infection, but was able nevertheless to identify key processes that control TNF and bacterial level interplays in a granuloma. Together with bridging in vivo and in vitro models, multiscale models for H5N1 disease could address important specific questions, as, for instance, how many infected cells in the upper or lower respiratory tract are necessary for efficient viral transmission?, or is there a threshold in viral replication rate in the lower respiratory tract that determines fatal outcome?",

            "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear that host genetics influences the pathogenesis of infectious disease (Aouizerat et al., 2011, Newport and Finan, 2011, Wurfel, 2008). Clinical disease associated with influenza infection can range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory disease, including the onset of ARDS. The basis for a genetic predisposition to fatal influenza was demonstrated through a genealogical assessment of a Utah Population Database (Albright et al., 2008). Familial aggregation can be a hallmark of genetically determined disease that has led some to postulate a heritable contribution explaining H5N1 infection observed among blood relatives for three Indonesian clusters in 2005 (Kandun et al., 2008, Olsen et al., 2005, WHO, 2010). A compilation of confirmed H5N1 cases worldwide found that, on average, 22% of cases occurred in clusters, and only 6% of cases within the clusters were not genetically related to other cluster members (Horby et al., 2010). In addition, acute encephalopathy is a rare complication of influenza infection, which is more commonly reported in Japan and East-Asia, and with some family cases (de Jong et al., 2005, Prasun and Stockton, 2012). This complication has been associated with a missense mutation in TLR3 (Hidaka et al., 2006) and with the observation of reduced enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT-II) related to a polymorphism in the CPT-II gene in Japanese (Chen et al., 2005) and Chinese patients (Mak et al., 2011). Moreover, several human genetic variants have been recently associated with severe pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 infection (Antonopoulou et al., 2012, Everitt et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2012, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2012). GWAS studies have supported a genetic basis of infectious disease susceptibility in humans (Chapman and Hill, 2012), and international collaborative projects like the 1000 Genomes Project initiative aim to provide further data on sequence variation and haplotype structure of multiple human populations (Consortium, 2010).",

Differential host responses have been investigated using a variety of inbred laboratory strains showing differences in susceptibility phenotypes (Alberts et al., 2010, Boon et al., 2011, Otte et al., 2011, Srivastava et al., 2009). Boon et al. (2011) showed H5N1 infection of a panel of 21 inbred mouse strains results in variable disease phenotypes, and further inspection of 6 H5N1 virus-infected inbred mouse strains, DBA/2, 129/Svlm, A/J, SM, C57BL/6, and BALB/c, revealed SM, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were more resistant to H5N1 infection, whereas DBA/2, 129/Svlm and A/J mouse strains were more susceptible to H5N1 infection. The strains that were more susceptible to infection had higher viral loads in the lung and increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as CCL2, IFN\u03b2, and TNF. In contrast, the resistant mouse strains had reduced virus titers in the lung that resulted in lower production of pro-inflammatory mediators and less lung immunopathology. Boon et al. (2011) concluded that the genetic component of susceptible hosts controlling disease severity is primarily influencing viral replication, though it can also be argued that the genetic component of susceptible hosts causes mice to mount an uncontrolled or overly aggressive immune response with pathologic consequences.",

The CC is a recombinant inbred mouse resource designed to capture the genetic heterogeneity of the human population, supporting systems genetics studies. The mouse resource is being utilized to identify host genetic determinants regulating resistance or susceptibility to respiratory virus infection among other phenotypic variances (Aylor et al., 2011). Host genetic components underlying complex traits associated with infection can be explored by quantitative trait loci (QTL) and expression QTL (eQTL) analysis. Initial studies in pre-CC mice, incompletely inbred animals from CC lines, showed that there was wide phenotypic variation in influenza and SARS-CoV-associated disease, such as significant differences in weight loss, viral lung titers, and immune cell infiltration at 4 dpi (Ferris et al., 2013). Bottomly et al. (2012) used pre-CC mice to elucidate the genetic control of eQTL in mice with extreme response to influenza infection. Significant eQTL were identified that allowed examination of genes associated with regulation of host response to infection. The pattern of allele effects across the eight founder animal haplotypes used in conjunction with whole-genome sequences (Keane et al., 2011) will likely reveal candidate SNPs that can be validated experimentally in fully recombinant inbred intercrosses (RIX) that are developed in the future.",

            "text": "The ultimate overarching goal of systems biology models for H5N1 is to lead to new antiviral therapies or patient care management strategies that would prevent severe cases of H5N1 infection. Analysis of transcriptomic data has led to the testing of several drugs that target the cellular response in an effort to identify immunomodulatory drugs that potentially inhibit H5N1 replication (Cameron et al., 2008, Josset et al., 2010). These studies were based on the simple idea that reverting or stopping the host response induced by the virus will inhibit its replication. However, targeting the genes that are associated with infection does not always prevent infection. For instance, H5N1 lethality is associated with high induction of cytokines, but deletion of specific cytokine genes, including IL-6, MIP1\u03b1, IL1-R and TNF-R1 genes, quite unexpectedly displayed different phenotypes in knock-out (KO) mice after infection with H5N1 viruses (Szretter et al., 2007). While IL-6 and MIP1\u03b1 KO mice had no difference in morbidity, IL1-R KO mice exhibited increased mortality and TNF-R1 KO mice showed reduced mortality, protecting animals from lethal infection. This study illustrates the well-known maxim that \u201ccorrelation is not causation\u201d and that cellular pathways are redundant and might have unknown facets. Redundancy in cellular pathways was especially obvious by looking at the host response of IFNR1 KO mice to VN1203 (Fig. 1). Even in the absence of the IFN receptor, these mice elicited steady and sustained activation of type I IFN-related genes, leading to a high inflammation that was associated with death (Cilloniz et al., 2010).",

For now, models that have been inferred by profiling the transcriptional response from whole mouse lung have predicted several significant regulators of the host response to H5N1 infection (McDermott et al., in review); however, these models are unable to predict the effect of their disruption on outcome. For example, both Ido1 (Fig. 3) and Kepi genes were identified as regulators of H5N1 pathogenesis, yet deletion of Ido1 protected mice against VN1203 and SARS-CoV, while Kepi disruption increased SARS-CoV susceptibility. To be able to predict the behavior of a system from a gene regulatory network, causal relationships are needed. In terms of reverse-engineering gene regulatory networks, perturbations of network variables are required to infer causation networks (Maathuis et al., 2010). These perturbations could result from KO (in vivo) or siRNA (in vitro) experiments. However, single gene deletion may miss or under-estimate the role of a gene in the case of functional redundancy and synergy between genes. As a result, we need multiple perturbations of the system. Genetic polymorphisms in a segregating population are ideal settings for multifactorial perturbations of a living system, particularly as each allele is a potential source of perturbation (Rockman, 2008). Several modeling approaches, such as Bayesian networks (Vignes et al., 2011, Xing et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2007) and structural equation modeling (SEM) (Aten et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2008), have been developed to infer causal networks from system genetics experiments. Applying these methods to \u2018omics\u2019 data from CC mice infected with H5N1 will not only link susceptibility alleles to phenotypes, but it will also infer a better predictive model that could be used to orient new treatment and predict therapeutic efficacy.",

The major challenge that we are now facing is how to integrate this information in a quantitative and predictive model of H5N1 disease that will inform patient care and accelerate drug development. Systems biology for H5N1 aims to systematically quantify and integrate every level of the host response to infection from scales spanning the single cell to the whole organism, in an effort to build global models of H5N1 disease. We expect that an integrative H5N1 model will utilize several of the approaches outlined in this review, such as causality networks or multiscale modeling, and that this will require new types of data that are being generated through advancement of technologies. For example, single-cell analysis could be used to model events occurring at the level of one or more virus particles and the target cell. At higher spatial levels, efforts such as the Lung Physiome have modeled the relationships between lung function and the organ structure. This information could, in turn, be used as a scaffold to model the location of H5N1 infection and pathologic events leading to ARDS, such as immune cell infiltration and hyaline membrane formation. Finally, the CC mice represent multi-factorial perturbations of the systems that could be used to refine our models.",
