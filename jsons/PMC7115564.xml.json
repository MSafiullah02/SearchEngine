Since the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains of VSV-G are sufficient to tether heterologous proteins to the exosome-like vesicle (ELV), VSV-G itself should also be incorporated into the ELVs. The G protein of the VSV is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein about 66 kDa in size and is composed of an ectodomain, a membrane spanning domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The VSV-G protein mediates attachment of the viral particle to the cell membrane and induces fusion of the viral envelope with that of the target cell at pH below 6.0 [10].",

We also previously demonstrated that incorporating a fusion-competent, but not a fusion-deficient, VSV-G into an HIV-1-derived viral-like particle (VLP) vaccine led to a more than 100-fold increase in antibody titers against the HIV-gag proteins of the VLP [13].

Incorporation of VSV-G into the ELV provided enhanced uptake of the vesicles and presentation of exosomal antigens by DC, as well as phenotypic and functional DC maturation in vitro.

The ELVs were labeled with the carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) dye, which becomes highly fluorescent upon internalization, while FITC-dextran was used as positive control. For the standardization of the data from several experiments and to consider the background fluorescence, the \u201cuptake index\u201d was calculated as the ratio of fluorescence intensity of the cells incubated at 37 \u00b0C to that of the cells incubated on ice.

Control ELVs (O-ELV, ELV-Gmut) showed lower levels of up-regulation that could reflect general ELVs features (Fig. 4A). The observed effect was dose-dependent and became undetectable at ELV concentrations of 1 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown).",

O-ELV and O-ELV-Gmut did not enhance proliferation of TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant OVA epitope (OVA257\u2013264) in comparison to the same amount of soluble OVA (Fig. 5C, D and A, respectively). In contrast, incorporation of fusion-competent VSV-G into ELVs (O-ELV-G) increased presentation approximately 100-fold, since the number of cell divisions after pulsing cells with O-ELV-G at a final concentration of 0.01 \u03bcg OVA/ml was comparable to that obtained after pulsing DC with 1 \u03bcg/ml of soluble OVA (Fig. 5E and B, respectively). Importantly, preparing ELV-G and O-ELV by separate transfections and mixing them just prior to incubations with DC, did not show any stimulatory effect. Similarly, mixing of soluble OVA with ELV-G did not enhance T cell proliferation either (Fig. 5F\u2013I). This indicates, that the co-localization of fusion-competent VSV-G and the protein antigen of interest on the same ELV is necessary for enhancement of cross-presentation.",

The processing pathway of O-ELV-G in DC was examined using various inhibitors. Brefeldin A was used as an inhibitor of exocytosis, lactacystin as an irreversible proteasomal inhibitor and ammonium chloride as an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, which also delays endosomal/lysosomal maturation. The processing of the Kb-restricted OVA257\u2013264 has been reported to be proteasome-dependent, as determined by activation of a T cell hybridoma [25] and expression of cell surface OVA257\u2013264-MHC class I complexes [26]. In our experiments, pre-treatment of DC with lactacystin inhibited the presentation of OVA257\u2013264 peptide derived from soluble OVA. However, the same drug did not abrogate the proliferation of OT-1 cells if OVA was taken up by DC as O-ELV-G (Fig. 6\n). In contrast, ammonium chloride strongly inhibited cross-presentation of O-ELV-G even at a low dose of 40 nM, but it was absolutely ineffective for soluble OVA (Fig. 6). BFA dramatically blocked the proliferation of specific T cells in both cases (Fig. 6). The presentation of exogenous OVA257\u2013264 peptide, which does not require any processing, was not affected by any of the treatments and could serve as an internal control for the proliferative features of the CD8+ T cells (data not shown). Therefore it can be concluded that DC process ELVs containing fusion-competent VSV-G through a degradation mechanism that involves endosomal acidification. The classical proteasomal degradation pathway does not seem to be the main source for the immunodominant peptides loaded onto MHC class I molecules.",

Indeed, although control exosomes can be effectively internalized by freshly isolated murine splenic DC, incorporation of fusogenic form of VSV-G improved the delivery of these ELVs to DC (Fig. 3). However, to stimulate immune responses, rather than tolerance, antigen internalization by DC should be accompanied by the innate immune system signals, which induce phenotypic and functional maturation of DC. The protein composition of exosomes was reported to have immunostimulatory effects [6], which could explain phenotypic activation of DC by control ELV in vitro (Fig. 4A). Another plausible explanation may be the xenogenic origin of the vesicles. However, in similar experiments with human monocyte-derived DC some degree of activation was also observed (unpublished observations). On the other hand, unlike VSV-G containing ELVs, control ELVs failed to up-regulate the activation markers on murine bone marrow-derived DC (data not shown) and to stimulate production of IL-12p70 by splenic DC (functional maturation) (Fig. 4B). Together this suggests that VSV-G containing exosomes provide a maturation signal for immature and not fully matured DC.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism of the signal is under discussion. Using lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with VSV-G, Pichlmair et al. recently showed that murine bone marrow-derived plasmacytoid DC could be activated not due to the virus-like particle itself but rather due to specific shaped structures that carry residual amounts of plasmid DNA and act as agonists for TLR9 [27]. Although we could detect trace amounts of dsDNA in our ELV preparations ranging from 2.1 to 162 ng/ml (mean: 49.9 \u00b1 50.6 ng/ml), the dsDNA was present in all ELV types independently of co-expression of VSV-G and within the same co-transfection experiment only minor differences in dsDNA content were found between samples containing fusiogenic and mutant form of VSV-G (data not shown). Thus, our results are more consistent with a VSV-G triggered signaling pathway recently described to act downstream from TLR4 [28]. The in vitro cross-presentation experiments further hint to a specific, fusion-dependent mechanism for VSV-G-mediated enhancement of DC's stimulatory activity. Despite stimulation of DC maturation, VSV-G containing ELVs were not able to stimulate cross-priming by DC co-exposed to soluble OVA or ELVs containing OVA. Physical co-localization of VSV-G and the OVA protein on the same ELVs seems to be required for the VSV-G-mediated enhancement of cross-presentation (Fig. 6). For both, the parental VSV and VSV-G pseudotyped viral vectors, the route of viral genetic material into the cytoplasm is through a phagosomal\u2013endolysosomal low-pH compartment [10], [29], known as alternative MHC class I pathway for processing of internalized protein antigens [23]. We could demonstrate that a low dose of NH4Cl, which blocks not only the intravesicular acidification but also the phagosome\u2013lysosome fusion, strongly inhibited the processing of VSV-G containing ELVs. At the same time, blockade of classical MHC class I pathway was rather ineffective (Fig. 6). This suggests that the main part of VSV-G-dependent cross-presentation of OVA is due to ELV internalization into acidic endolysosomal compartment from which the antigen gains access to the retrograde transport pathway for MHC class I presentation. Interestingly, Blander and Medzhitov proposed a model where MHC class II presentation is dependent on the presence of TLR ligands within the phagocytosed cargo [30]. In an individual phagosome, the TLR ligands enhance the kinetics of the fusion reaction in the endocytic pathway and activate hydrolytic enzymes [31]. This may explain why OVA physically associated with VSV-G was shuttled to the alternative MHC class I pathway instead of terminal degradation in lysosomes.",

We previously demonstrated that VSV-G incorporated into HIV-based viral-like particles enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses against HIV-gag [13]. At the same time, our attempt to incorporate VSV-G into exosomal vaccines containing the S protein of SARS-CoV did not significantly increase the immune responses against the SARS-S [9]. Since both proteins are fusion-competent transmembrane glycoproteins, the immunostimulatory effect of VSV-G might be masked by the fusion activity of the SARS-S. In the present study, we therefore used recombinant OVA protein as a membrane-bound model antigen to characterize immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G in the context of ELV vaccines.",
