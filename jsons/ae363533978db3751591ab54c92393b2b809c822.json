            "text": "In a simulated aerosol generating experiment generated by 3-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a 216 Goldberg drum, SARS-CoV-2 could survive on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for 72 hours, 217 cardboard 24 hours and copper 4 hours. The median half-life of the virus in this simulated 218 aerosol was 2.7 hours with 95% credible interval 1. 65-7.24 hours. 34 In contrast, in a real-world 219 experiment in Singapore, three patients' rooms were sampled at multiple sites including air 220 samples, which revealed that bleach disinfection was highly effective in two rooms and fomite 221 contamination was common in the third room. Notably, air samples, protective equipment, 222 anteroom and corridor outside of anteroom were negative. 35 Additionally, a case report of 223 emergency intubation in an unsuspected COVID-19 patient subsequently found to be positive 224 showed that no healthcare workers on surgical or N95 masks were infected. 36 Safe and optimal care of the parturient in the peripartum period requires a multidisciplinary team 243 approach. 37 The healthcare professionals that provide this coordinated care include obstetricians, 244 neonatologists, anesthesiologists, midwives and support services at the delivery suite. Here, we 245 highlight the acute care perspectives of the parturient, summarize existing evidence, and propose 246 an algorithmic approach for the management of the acutely ill parturient. When a COVID-19 parturient with desaturation (oxygen saturation decreases to \u226493%) presents 256 for emergency cesarean delivery, general anesthesia needs to be administered. This is done with When the parturient's oxygen saturation is adequate (94% and above), 6, 10 regional anesthesia If there is absence of maternal and / or fetal compromise, and emergency cesarean delivery is not 295 indicated, further plans for management of the patient are then made ( Figure 3 ). When 296 parturients are acutely ill, it may be challenging to differentiate the etiologies based on the presence of tachypnea and tachycardia. The percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen 298 (SpO 2 ) is non-invasive continuous monitoring that provides real time information on peripheral 299 oxygen saturation. It also provides indirect information on adequacy of pulmonary gas exchange, 300 cardiac function and intravascular volume status. There is correlation between oxygenation 301 measured by SpO 2 and invasive arterial blood gas. An arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) 302 of less than 60mmHg corresponds to SpO 2 of less than 90%. 44 Delivery units need to be 303 equipped with, and use continuous SpO 2 monitoring. Disposable low cost SpO 2 finger probes are 304 commercially available and need to be considered when multi-parameter monitoring is not 305 available. Knowing the (P-F ratio) which is the ratio between PaO 2 and fraction of inspired 306 oxygen (FiO 2 ) is useful in predicting the degree of lung compromise. 6",

            "text": "practical and swift method for the assessment of hypotension is by bedside transthoracic 311 echocardiography (TTE) in order to guide management. 45 A poorly contractile left ventricle 312 signifies cardiac pump failure. In this situation, fluids should be restricted, and the use of 313 inotropes should be considered. Hyperdynamic cardiac activity as evidenced by 'kissing' 314 ventricular walls is suggestive of distributive shock such as in sepsis. This requires fluid 315 resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. The TTE probe can also be used to image the inferior 316 vena cava (IVC) to assess the patient's intravascular volume status. Avoidance of fluid 317 mismanagement is crucial; fluid loading in cardiomyopathy can precipitate congestive cardiac 318 failure that worsens lung oxygenation. Cardiovascular causes of desaturation in COVID-19 include systolic failure from viral 320 myocarditis, congestive cardiac failure and pulmonary edema. The SARS-CoV-2 surface 321 glycoprotein interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the respiratory 322 epithelial cells in the host. The predominant pulmonary features are from expression of ACE2 in 323 the type 2 alveolar cells. Elevated blood pressure is known to occur from interaction between the 324 virus and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 46 This might result in misdirected 325 management towards preeclampsia while the hypertension was a cardiovascular manifestation of 326 COVID-19. Myocardial injury as evidenced by raised troponins is a feature of cytokines storm 47 327 high concentrations of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, (GCSF), interferon gamma-328 induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), macrophage 329 inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP1\u03b1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). 15 Cytokine 330 storms are known to associated with disease severity and admissions to the ICU. 17, 47 331 Morbid manifestations of COVID-19 such as severe pneumonia, ARDS, multi-organ dysfunction 332 syndrome (MODS) require advanced ventilatory and circulatory support. 12 When patients 333 present with hypoxemia, It is important to differentiate between failure of gas exchange in the 334 lungs and cardiogenic causes of pump failure. 43 Pulmonary causes of desaturation from 335 pneumonia, acute lung injury and ARDS are more difficult to manage as they may require 336 prolonged mechanical ventilation. 337 Pressurized air enriched with oxygen is needed for improving oxygenation in acutely ill patients 338 with respiratory compromise. It can be administered via nasal masks, full face masks, and 339 helmets. Simulator based experiments have shown that continuous positive airway pressure 340 (CPAP) with tight fitting oronasal mask and Non-Invasive ventilation with well-sealed helmets 341 are effective, posing negligible risk of exhaled air dispersion. 48 Similar studies have shown that exhaled air dispersion distance during application of high flow nasal cannula is shorter than 343 CPAP that tend to be less tightly applied. 49 Hence centers that are experienced and equipped 344 with negative pressure rooms could consider non-invasive ventilation, high flow nasal cannula 345 and CPAP, especially in the face of COVID-19 pandemic when facilities with full mechanical 346 ventilatory support are overwhelmed. 347 Where the patient's oxygen saturation is refractory to mechanical ventilatory support, 348 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 50 should be considered. Initiating ECMO in a 349 pregnant patient needs special considerations. While anticoagulation is needed to prevent clotting 350 in the extracorporeal circulation, this complicates hemostasis at the placental site if ECMO is 351 used in the peripartum period. The setting up of ECMO requires multidisciplinary planning and 352 is best done in tertiary institutions. Maternal and child health facilities without cardiac surgical 353 intensive care units might not be able to acquire this service. The transfer of critically ill patients 354 to tertiary institutions needs meticulous planning. the early information on treating COVID-19 was derived from experience in SARS. 359 Data on the use of antiviral therapy for COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited. 51 In SARS, ribavirin 360 and corticosteroid showed possible harm with inconclusive clinical data, while studies on 361 convalescent plasma, interferon and lopinavir were inconclusive. 52 In the first randomized 362 controlled trial on treating COVID-19, lopinavir-ritonavir 400mg/100mg twice daily was found to be similar to standard of care in time to clinical improvement, mortality and viral shedding. 53 364 This may be due to differences in viral proteases between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 365 and coronavirus. 54 An invitro study on repurposed drugs for COVID-19 reported effective 366 concentration 50 (EC50) of 0.77 for remdesivir, 1.13 for chloroquine, 61.88 for favipiravir and 367 109.50 for ribavirin. 55 The EC50 for hydroxychloroquine was significantly higher than 368 chloroquine. 56 In a French non-randomized study, 57 26 patients received hydroxychloroquine 369 200mg thrice daily for ten days of whom six also received azithromycin 500mg on day one and 370 250mg daily for next four days. Compared with 16 patients not treated, there was significant 371 reduction in viral load at day 6 and shorter duration of viral shedding, with additive effect from 372 azithromycin. In a Chinese non-randomized study, 58 35 patients were treated with favipiravir 373 1600mg twice daily on day one and 600mg twice daily from day 2-14 and 45 patients were 374 treated with lopinavir-ritonavir; patients in both arms received aerosolized interferon alpha 375 (IFN\u03b1) 5 million units twice daily. Compared with control, favipiravir was associated with 376 shorter viral shedding and faster radiological improvement. 377 378 The delivery suite and considerations for minimizing cross contamination 379 Enhanced infection control precautions include restrictions to the number of personnel in the 380 delivery suite. This is to minimize cross contaminations, movements between care locations and 381 the number of external visitors and care providers. 59 The care of the parturient should be 382 specialist-led. When there is a suspicion of, or confirmed case of COVID-19, delivery processes 383 such as water birth, need to be revised to limit the potential spread of infection. In addition, strict 384 adherence to policies for segregations of teams deployed in delivery suite, general ward, procedure rooms and outpatient units is recommended. 51 The workflow on peripartum 386 management of COVID-19 women is detailed in Appendix. 387 Labor analgesia can be planned well in advance such that when patients are in early labor, they 388 receive good pain control through initiation of epidural analgesia. 10 This reduces chances of viral 389 disseminations during hyperventilation when the parturient is in pain, thus reducing risks of 390 cross-contamination for staff attending to the patient. 25 Inhaled entonox is not recommended 10 391 as it could increase the risk of viral dissemination through aerosols, especially when the 392 parturient is not able to achieve tight uninterrupted mask seal throughout the duration of labor. of newborn of COVID-19 mothers 396 Current evidence shows that there is no vertical transmission during pregnancy. 2, 9 Yet, babies 397 that are born to COVID-19 mothers can acquire the infection post-delivery. Practices such as 398 delayed cord clamping and skin to skin bonding between mothers and newborns are not 399 recommended. The evidence regarding the safety of breast feeding is still limited. 2, 25, 51 400 Considerations can be made to allow the use of screened donated breast milk from mothers who 401 are free of COVID-19.",
