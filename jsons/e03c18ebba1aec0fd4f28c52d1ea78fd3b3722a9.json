Increasing data reveal that they function in innate antiviral immunity through complex mechanisms. Thousands of lncRNAs are regulated by RNA virus or DNA virus infection. The significant differential expression of lncRNAs is induced by virus or host antiviral signaling mediated by interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. In turn, these lncRNAs modulate the host immune response including the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR)-related signaling, the translocation and activation of transcription factors, the production of IFNs and cytokines, the IFNactivated JAK-STAT signaling and the transcription of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using gain-or loss-of-function analysis, the effect of lncRNAs on viral replication has been investigated to elucidate the essential role of lncRNA in the host-virus interaction. lncRNAs have shown specifically elevated or decreased levels in patients with viral diseases, suggesting the possibility of clinical application as biomarkers. Here we review the current advances of viral infection-associated host lncRNAs, their functional significance in different aspects of antiviral immune response, the specific mechanisms and unsolved issues. We also summarize the regulation of lncRNAs by viruses, PRR agonists and cytokines. In addition, virus-encoded lncRNAs and their functional involvement in host-virus interaction are addressed.",

            "text": "V iral infection is an important etiological factor of various infectious diseases including acute illnesses such as influenza pandemics, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola virus disease, as well as chronic conditions such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), viral hepatitis and many virus-associated cancers. Host has evolved deliberated antiviral immune system to eliminate the invading virus. In mammalian cells, thousands of proteins participate in the innate and adaptive antiviral immunity. Although the protein-mediated antiviral mechanisms have been established for many years, the exquisite immune regulation network to provide appropriate protection with minimal inflammatory damage is still not fully understood. Compared with microRNAs, which are well-known noncoding RNA regulators of immune genes, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly recognized key components of the complicated antiviral immune system. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] lncRNAs are designated as the transcripts longer than 200 nt without protein-coding capacity. [1] [2] [3] Similar to mRNA, lncRNAs are spliced products of RNA polymerase II or III, 5 0 -capped, and with or without 3 0 -polyadenylation. Based on their genomic locations relative to adjacent protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are classified as sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic, and intergenic lncRNAs. Previously considered as 'junk' in the genome, but lncRNAs are recently recognized as critical regulators in various cellular processes. 3, 5, [10] [11] [12] The lncRNA genes occupy the majority of pervasively transcribed genomes in human or mouse cells. 13 The current GENCODE releases have annotated 15,931 human lncRNA genes (Version 23) and 8359 mouse lncRNA genes (Version M6). 14 However, as of July 2015 only a small portion of human and mouse lncRNAs (181 and 114, respectively) have been experimentally characterized as functional RNAs as provided by lncRNAdb. 15 Therefore, the functioning of the most lncRNAs remains largely unknown. Recently, increasing evidences have confirmed the crucial roles of lncRNAs in host antiviral response. [7] [8] [9] 16, 17 The broad spectrum of activities and versatile regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs suggest that lncRNAs are key regulators of host immunity during viral infection. For example, NeST RNA is found to epigenetically regulate the transcription of its neighboring IFN-\u03b3-encoding gene. 8 This finding provides novel insights into complicated mechanisms underlying regulation of IFN-\u03b3. However, although the functional lncRNAs involved in antiviral innate immunity are explosively accumulated, limited information is available about lncRNAs associated with adaptive immunity. In this review, we will highlight the lncRNAs associated with viral infection, especially focusing on the expression of lncRNAs regulated by virus or host antiviral signaling, together with their functions and underlying mechanisms in the antiviral immunity.",

            "text": "lncRNAs are an important new class of regulators in a wide range of cellular activities. For example, they are involved in metastasis (HOTAIR), 18 Xchromosome imprint (XIST), 19 development (Airn), 20 stem cell pluripotency (HOTTIP), 21 and immune response (lincRNA-Cox2). 22 Small regulatory noncoding microRNA (about 19-25 nt in length) also participate in many cellular activities. The silencing mechanism of microRNA is to modulate the mRNA degradation or translation via base-pairing of the target mRNA with specific sequences. 23 In comparison with these small ncRNAs, lncRNAs have multiple and flexible mechanisms mediated by their specific sequences or structural motifs that bind with DNA, RNA or protein. 2, 12, [24] [25] [26] They act as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds to regulate different processes, ranging from chromatin remodeling, transcription, splicing, mRNA stabilization, protein translation to protein translocation (described in details by several reviews). 1, 2, 12, 25, 26 It is well-known that lncRNA HOTAIR epigenetically represses the gene transcription by acting as a scaffold that is involved in recruiting the Polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for the H3K27 methylation, and the LSD1 complex responsible for the H3K4me2 demethylation. 18, 24 A recent study reveals that lncRNA NeST critically regulates IFN-\u03b3 transcription by recruiting the WDR5 and MLL/Ash2L/RbBP5 complex to enhance the H3K4me3 modification. 8 Moreover, it has been shown that lncRNA THRIL and lincRNA-Cox2 regulate the transcription of TNF-\u03b1 and CCL5, respectively through binding with hnRNP L and hnRNP A/B and A2/B1. 22, 27 Interestingly, some lncRNAs, such as NRON and lnc-DC, regulate transcription by modulating the activities of transcription factors. NRON-protein complex binds transcription factor NFAT in cytoplasm and thus releases activated NFAT for nuclear transportation after stimulation. 28 lnc-DC acts to maintain the phosphorylation state of transcription factor STAT3 and increase its nuclear entry. 29 In addition, some lncRNAs regulate gene expression at posttranscription level. For example, lncRNA BACE1-AS stabilizes BACE1 mRNA by forming a dsRNA complex through base-pairing. 30 With the help of translation inhibitor Rck, lincRNA-p21 suppresses translation through partially base-pairing with target mRNAs. 31 lncRNA-BGL3 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for binding microRNAs to regulate PTEN expression. 32 On the other hand, it is also worth to note that recent studies provided evidences that putative lncRNAs might harbour small ORFs and can be translated into functional micropeptides. 33, 34 Therefore, it is important to determine the coding-capacity when a novel lncRNA is identified. lncRNAs are the key component of regulatory network maintaining cellular homeostasis, and the dysfunction of lncRNAs is associated with many diseases, such as cancers, degenerative disorders, autoimmune, and viral diseases. 5, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] 27, 32, 35, 36 ",

            "text": "Viral infection of host cells causes viral diseases and also triggers host antiviral innate immune response. Enveloped virus enters the cell membrane through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by viral genome release into the cytoplasm. Then viral genome utilizes cellular machinery and viral enzymes to replicate and assemble new progeny virions. After virus invasion, host cells can quickly sense viral components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface [Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4], on the membrane of endosome (TLR 3,7/8, and 9), or within the cytoplasm (RIG-I, MDA5, DAI, and NLRs) (see Figure 1 ). 37,38 PRRdependent signaling pathways activate transcription factors (TFs) such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB. After the nuclear import of these TFs, robust interferons (IFNs), chemokines, and other cytokines are expressed. In turn, IFNs bind with their corresponding receptors, leading to the activation of JAK-STAT signaling. After the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STATs, they mediate formation of the transcription complex ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9) that initiates the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). 37 In addition to the activation of signaling and TFs, the open state of chromatin and the mRNA stabilization are simultaneously required for the transcription of some critical antiviral genes, such as MxA, IFIT1 and IFITM3. 39 It has been revealed that pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) can exploit cellular machinery to control the transcription of a subset of ISGs by altering their histone modifications. 40 Viral infection and replication are strongly blocked directly by some critical ISGs, such as MxA, IFITM3, and IFIT3 through various mechanisms. 37, 41 However, many cellular proteins are responsible for the negative regulation of IFN production and signaling, such as SOCS1, PIAS, and IFI35, which not only repress the JAK-STAT pathway but also inhibit PRR. [42] [43] [44] Type I IFNs signaling also mediates the development or activation of innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), NK cells, and T cells, which eliminates the virus-infected cells directly or indirectly. 45 While the critical antiviral roles of proteins have been well-characterized, little is known about lncRNAs, until recently when increasing evidences have presented and demonstrated that lncRNAs are important players in the battle between virus and host.",

Solid evidences from IAV and SARS-CoV infected eight collaborative cross mouse founder strains further confirm that 5329 lncRNAs are differentially expressed and strongly correlated with viral replication and morbidity. 48 The module-based annotation reveals that most lncRNAs are co-expressed with coding genes associated with lung homeostasis or immune response. The database MONOCLdb (www.monocldb.org) provides 5295 mouse lncRNAs and their functional annotations. Similarly, hundreds of lncRNAs are found differentially expressed in IAV (WSN/H1N1) infected human A549 cells. 9, 49 Infection with positive-strand RNA virus EV71, the pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease, results in upregulation of 2990 lncRNAs and downregulation of 1876 lncRNAs in human RD cells. 47 Many of these lncRNAs have a co-regulated nearby protein-coding gene.

            "text": "Further investigations are required to define the functional involvement of these lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of these viruses. It is worth noting that the unique expression patterns or dysregulation of lncRNAs might be useful tools in clinical diagnosis or surveillance. In Table 1 , shown are some critical lncRNAs that are induced or suppressed by viruses such as SARS-CoV, IAV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). For example, among the 83 differentially expressed lncRNAs in HIV-1-infected T cell lines Jurkat and MT4, lncRNA BIC, LIT, MALAT1, and NEAT1 are upregulated, whereas PANDA and SRA are downregulated. 56 The high expression of lncRNA HEIH is found associated with HBVinduced HCC recurrence. 61 Both lncRNA-uc003wbc and lncRNA-AF085935 are upregulated in HBV patients and HCC patients but to different levels, suggesting their clinical applications as diagnosis biomarkers. 62 In addition to the host lncRNAs regulated by invaded viruses, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) encoded long noncoding genetic elements are identified to stimulate intracellular sensors. 63 It is suggested that the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS (cGMP-AMP synthase), its adaptor STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and the RNA sensor signaling adaptor MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) are required for the ERV-induced intracellular activation of B cells and subsequent T-cell-independent (TI) antibody production. The ERV noncoding nucleic acids, including cytosolic ERV mRNA and reverse-transcribed cDNA play as the TI antigens. The aberrant expression of ERV long noncoding nucleic acids is likely associated with the initiation of auto-inflammatory response of autoimmune disease. 64 Therefore, identification of these ERV lncRNAs might provide novel evidences for better understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. 27 It has been shown as well that 62 lncRNAs are induced in Pam3CSK4 stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), including the most significantly upregulated lincRNA-Cox2. 22 TLR4 is located on the membrane of endosome. It recognizes bacterial or viral pathogen and signals via adaptor MyD88 to activate NF-\u03baB. Using TLR4 agonist LPS, 20 lincRNAs in CD11C+ bone marrow-derived DCs are found remarkably upregulated. 54 Most (approximately 80%) of them are associated with NF-\u03baB signaling. Although the proportion of these PRR-associated lncRNAs among all the differentially expressed lncRNAs in virus-infected cells is unclear, it is very likely that they are important components of host antiviral innate immunity. Further characterization of these lncRNAs is needed to establish their roles in the host-virus interaction.",

In human hepatocytes, ISR2, ISR8, and ISR12 are induced by IFN-\u03b2 and IAV PR8\u0394NS1, and the expression of these ISRs mimics that of adjacent genes GBP6, IRF1, and IL6, respectively. 60 Increased expression of ISR2 is also detected in patients infected with HCV or HIV.

Importantly, current lines of evidences have strongly supported the functional involvement of lncRNAs in host antiviral response. Through gainor loss-of function experiments, some of these lncRNAs such as NeST, Lethe, lncRNA-CMPK2, VIN, and NRON are found hijacked by virus to facilitate virus infection or susceptibility. For example, the expression of lincRNA VIN (virus-inducible lincRNA) in human lung cells is upregulated by infection with IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H7N7) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). 49 Although precise mechanism underlying the action of nuclear lncRNA VIN is still unknown, it is clear that virus takes advantage of the increased VIN to ensure its efficient replication and viral protein synthesis. On the other hand, other lncRNAs such as lincRNA-Cox2, NRAV, NEAT1, 7SL, and lnc-DC play critical roles in the antiviral response. For example, host lncRNA 7SL is selectively packaged into HIV-1 particles and is a integral component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. 67 The packaged 7SL RNA is required for the antiviral activity of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G. As a key scaffold, 7SL binds with APOBEC3G, viral protein Gag, viral genomic RNA and tRNA3Lys. 68 Through the link of 7SL, APOBEC3G targets viral RNP and interferes with the HIV replication. Currently, most wellcharacterized functional lncRNAs are involved in antiviral innate response through regulating activity of TFs, the transcription of cytokines or the expression of ISGs.",

            "text": "During viral infection, host lncRNAs regulate various processes of antiviral response, including the TFs translocation and activity, IFN and cytokines production, ISGs transcription, and immune cell development (see Figure 1 ). For example, NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells) is essential for immune response and cell development. lncRNA NRON (noncoding repressor of NFAT) is highly enriched in thymus, spleen, and lymph node and found to be a NFAT inhibitor. 28, 50, 51 NRON exists in a scaffold RNA-protein complex via interaction with proteins KPNB1, CSE1L, and IQGAP1, 28 which binds phosphorylated NFAT in cytoplasm and represses its nuclear trafficking (see Figure 2 ). When T cells are activated, dephosphorylated NFAT is released from the complex and enters the nucleus. A recent study suggests that downregulation of NRON by HIV infection enhances NFAT nuclear translocation and activity. 51 Consequently, NFAT is hijacked by HIV to bind with the LTR of viral genome and facilitate viral protein synthesis and replication. Strikingly, HIV even utilizes NRON to control the balance between viral reproduction and cell death through HIV early expressed protein Neg and the late expressed protein Vpr to respectively decrease and increase NRON at different infection stage. 51 The HIV-induced upregulation of NFAT is simultaneously utilized by host as well to increase the adaptive immune response to HIV by activation of T cells. Another example is the pseudogene lncRNA Lethe. Lethe is upregulated directly by NF-\u03baB after stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 or glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone in mouse spleen, 17 or induced by HCV infection or LIF-mediated STAT3 activation in human liver Huh7 cells. 55 In turn, Lethe acts as a negative feedback modulator of NF-\u03baB signaling through interaction with NF-\u03baB subunit RelA (see Figure 2) . Like a decoy, Lethe blocks the binding site of RelA to target genes and subsequent transcription. In aged mice, increased NF-\u03baB activity might be associated with reduced Lethe abundance. The antiinflammatory therapeutic activity of dexamethasone might be mediated in part via NF-\u03baB repression by elevated Lethe. Overexpression of Lethe decreases the transcription of IL-6, IL-8, and NFKBia regulated by NF-\u03baB. The enhanced Lethe in Huh7 cells inhibits the expression of PKR, OAS, and IRF1, and promotes the HCV replication. 55 However, the impact of Lethe on other antiviral genes driven by NF-\u03baB, such as IFNs, still requires additional investigation.",

The knockdown and overexpression analysis reveals that NKILA, similar to Lethe, is a negative regulator of the transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes. NKILA interacts with other molecules to form a cytoplasmic complex comprising NKILA, NF-\u03baB, and inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB). In the complex, NKILA blocks the phosphorylation sites of I\u03baB from I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and protects I\u03baB from subsequent degradation. Therefore, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm and thereby NF-\u03baB driven transcription is inhibited. This mechanism underlying NKILA function is similar with that of cytoplasmic lnc-DC (discussed below). In addition, lncRNA PACER (p50-associated Cox2 extragenic RNA) acts as an extragenic positive regulator of NF-\u03baB to modulate the transcription of NF-\u03baB target gene Cox2, which is located on the antisense strand upstream of PACER. 58 Both PACER and Cox2 are significantly upregulated in PMA or LPS differentiated human U937 monocyte-macrophages. PACER directly binds with the repressive NF-\u03baB subunit p50. This interaction promotes the formation of the active form of NF-\u03baB, i.e., RelA-p50 heterodimer, leading to an increase in the transcription of Cox2. However, the precise role of NKILA and PACER in virus infection and replication remains to be further investigated.",

The antiviral function of NEAT1 depends on its essential role in nuclear paraspeckle formation and protein sequestration. 71 The expression of NEAT1 is significantly enhanced by HIV-1, JEV, RV, IAV, and HSV infection, TLR3 agonist (poly I:C) treatment, and the stresses from cancers and ALS. 7, 56, 57 In addition, viral infections also induce excessive formation of paraspeckles in human or mouse immune cells. Loss-of-function analysis has revealed that NEAT1 inhibits the HIV protein production and the translocation of HIV Advanced Review wires.wiley.com/rna unspliced INS-containing mRNA (e.g., gag/pol and env RNAs) from nucleus to cytoplasm. 56 Further investigations suggest that virus-elevated NEAT1 increases the transcription of IL-8 and other immune genes (e.g., CCL5, ISG20, IFIT3, RIG-I). Upon viral infection, abundant NEAT1 relocates the repressor SFPQs from the IL-8 gene promoters to paraspeckles, and then triggers the transcription of IL-8 (see Figure 3 ). The most recent finding reveals that NEAT1 interacts with SWI/SNF chromatinremodeling complexes, which are newly identified components of paraspeckles. 72 Therefore, NEAT1 probably regulates some gene expressions via epigenetic modulation. Figure 3 ). Therefore, the viral infection induced decrease of NRAV is suggested to be part of the host antiviral response. The histone modification 'OPEN' mark H3K4me3 and 'CLOSE' mark H3K27me3 of mxa and ifitm3 are shown to be modulated by NRAV. The NRAVassociated protein ZONAB is a multifunctional TF and might be involved in the NRAV-dependent regulation of the ISGs. However, further studies are required to determine the mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of NRAV during viral infection. lncRNA-CMPK2 is significantly upregulated in liver tissues of HCV-infected patients. 16 The elevated expression of lncRNA-CMPK2 might benefit the HCV replication. lncRNA-CMPK2 acts as a negative regulator of various ISGs, such as ISG15, CXCL10, IFIT3, IFITM1, Viperin, and CMPK2, but not that of Mx1 and IFIT1. The repression of ISGs by lncRNA-CMPK2 seems to be independent of IFN. lncRNA-CMPK2 might play a role in epigenetic modulation of a subset of ISG loci.

            "text": "As an important new class of RNA regulators, lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in multiple processes of antiviral innate immunity. Expression of host lncRNAs during viral infection can be regulated by viral components, or host PRR signaling-activated TFs, virus-induced cytokines, IFNs and chemokines, or other stimulations. Differentially expressed lncRNAs function as negative or positive regulators in various critical steps of antiviral response. For example, expression of lncRNAs has profound effects on activation of TFs, the production of IFN-\u03b3, cytokines and chemokines, activation of JAK-STAT signaling, and the transcription of ISGs. The altered expression or activity of these pivotal innate immune molecules significantly influences the host antiviral response and thereby affects the viral infection and replication. Interestingly, some lncRNAs acting as negative regulators of innate immunity can be hijacked by virus to inhibit the antiviral response, and lncRNAs functioning as positive regulators can be suppressed by virus during the infection. These findings provide strong evidences supporting the key role played by the ubiquitous and versatile lncRNAs in antiviral innate immunity. However, although thousands of lncRNAs are associated with viral infection, the number of lncRNAs with experimentally verified function is limited. Therefore, intensive studies are still needed to define the expression, regulation and functioning of lncRNAs during the viral pathogenesis. The future discoveries related to lncRNAs would provide a comprehensive understanding of the elaborate antiviral innate immunity.",
