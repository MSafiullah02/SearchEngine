The viral RNA genome contains a single open reading frame flanked by un-translated regions (UTR) at both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. A large viral polyprotein precursor of about 3010 amino acids is translated and sequentially cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into at least 10 different proteins, including structural proteins (C, E1, E2, and p7) and non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (Reed and Rice, 2000, Luo and Colacino, 2004). Replication of HCV RNA occurs in the cytoplasmic membrane-bound multiple-protein complex containing the HCV RNA and non-structural proteins NS3 to NS5B (Di Bishceglie, 1997, Luo and Colacino, 2004). Based on genome sequence similarity, HCV is grouped into six major genotypes and numerous subtypes (Tanaka et al., 1995).",

NS4A, a cofactor for NS3, stabilizes it to augment its serine protease activity and is essential for complete cleavage of the HCV polyprotein (Reed and Rice, 2000).

NS3 could transform NIH3T3 cells (Sakamuro et al., 1995) and rat fibroblasts (Zemel et al., 2001). NIH3T3 cells constitutively expressing truncated NS3 (aa 1\u2013433) were more resistant to Actinomycin D-induced apoptosis (Fujita et al., 1996). NS3 could also block transforming growth factor-\u03b1/Smad3-mediated apoptosis (Cheng et al., 2004). In addition, NS3\u2013NS4A complex suppresses beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) induction by inhibiting retinoic acid-inducible gene I-mediated activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 to help establish persistent HCV infection (Foy et al., 2003, Breiman et al., 2005, Foy et al., 2005). Recently it was reported that NS3 could inhibit the function of tumor suppressor p53 in a sequence-dependent manner, which partly interprets the different degree of oncogenic capacity of different HCV isolates (Lin et al., 2006).",

Here we investigated whether the rest proteins of HCV play roles, if any, in the regulation of COX-2 expression. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with plasmid (pCOX-2-Luc) carrying the reporter fusion gene, in which luciferase gene is under the control of COX-2 promoter and plasmids pCMV-Core, pCMV-E1, pCMV-E2, pCMV-P7, pCMV-NS2, pCMV-NS3, pCMV-NS4A, pCMV-NS4B, pCMV-NS5A, and pCMV-NS5B, carrying each of HCV genes, core, E1, E2, P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, respectively.
