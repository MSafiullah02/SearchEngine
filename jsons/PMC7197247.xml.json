            "text": "Recent years have witnessed increasing outbreaks of biomaterial-related infections such as Novel Coronavirus, Listeria monocytogenes and salmonella infections [1\u20133]. This has caused widespread concern because a growing number of patients are under death risk or under financial burden due to such infections [4\u20136]. Escherichia coli (E. coli) can be pathogenic under certain conditions, and the occurrence and prevalence of E. coli are worldwide. Prevent spreading germs by cleaning and disinfection are effective methods. However, the effect can remain for a period after disinfection. It will be a very high cost to clean and disinfect the things that people have frequent contact with over and over again. Thus, the sterilization experiment on the surface of antibacterial materials against E. coli rapidly in real time is one of the most popular, and most studied, tests around [4\u20136]. According to the surging demand of antibacterial medical materials [4, 5, 7, 8], the surface modification of 316L stainless steel (SS), which is widely applied in medical field, has garnered considerable attention to enhance its antibacterial property [9\u201311].",

            "text": "Presently, the antibacterial mechanism of 316L SS is mainly based on the dissolution of Ag, Cu, or Zn ions [9\u201312], which is limited by several factors such as the safe range of ion concentration, competition between rates of ion dissolution and bacterial proliferation and the antibacterial period [13\u201316]. Photocatalysis is a highly efficient and inexpensive technique to inhibit and kill the bacteria [17\u201320]. It is based on the photochemical properties of semiconductor photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\mathrm{O}}_{2}^{\\bullet -}$$\\end{document}O2\u2219-) radicals under external energy such as the natural energy of sunlight [20\u201322]. TiO2, a wide band gap semiconductor (3.2 eV), is generally used as a photocatalyst in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation [23, 24]. However, it is still restricted by the large band gap structure and very high recombination rate of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs [25]. Coupling TiO2 with Ag nanoparticle (TiO2@Ag) is an efficient way to improve its photocatalytic property under visible light [19, 26, 27]. It is well known that the photocatalytic activity depends on the utilization of light energy as well as on the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes [28]. Several existing studies have demonstrated that an thin amorphous TiO2 nanolayer can not only increase the specific surface area to enhance light harvesting but also improves the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity [29\u201331]. Wu et al. fabricated Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles through dopamine-assisted process, which exhibited high activity for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis bacteria under visible light [32]. The decrease in the thickness of the coating accelerates the transformation of photo-generated carriers. Polydopamine (PDA) [9, 33], a biopolymer mimic of mussels, can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity through effective transfer of photoinduced electrons and protons. Further, PDA nanofilms do not alter the morphology of surface coating [34, 35].",

The use of anodized 316L SS has received considerable attention for increasing the surface areas, because the inert SS with high corrosion resistance are difficultly corroded [39\u201341]. In this study, we have synthesized a three-dimensional (3D) Ag/TiO2/PDA nanofilm using Ag-decorated amorphous TiO2 nanolayer as light harvester and PDA as transformation interface. This nanofilm was formed on anodized 316L SS to effectively inhibit or kill bacteria under visible light, which is attributed to the following two factors. Firstly, the Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite efficiently separated the visible photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. Secondly, the carriers were transferred to PDA. The visible light required in the antibacterial experiment was obtained from a normal flashlight, which means these antibacterial materials can be used in infrastructure construction and home products under Civilian LED lights, let alone the sunlight. The morphology and material property of the surface of 316L SS are also investigated. Further, the antibacterial rate and the formation mechanism of 3D Ag/TiO2/PDA under visible light are theoretically analyzed to provide clear insights on photocatalytic antibacterial activities.",

At the first anodization experiment, 316L SS was electropolished in ethylene glycol (EG) solution containing 5vol % perchloric acid at 20 V for 20 min. The electropolished sheets was used in the second anodization experiment in a 0.3 mol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution at 5 \u00b0C and anodized at 30 V for 20 min. The two-step anodization can directly produce the nanopore arrays on the surface of the anodized sheet.",

The variation of photocurrent density under repeated on/off visible light illumination (time step = 50 s) is shown in Fig. 1a\u2013c, and its value for different samples is shown in Fig. 1d. As the Figs.S1 and S2 show, the photocurrent densities of T-3 photoelectrodes were to be maximum at the bias of \u2212 0.8 V. Then, the bias of \u2212 0.8 V could be used in the subsequent study to measure the photocatalytic properties of T-3 photoelectrodes. The applied potential of \u2212 0.8 V (Fig. 1a) induced the optimal photocurrent densities of 0.21, 0.29, 0.42, and 0.22 \u03bcA cm\u22122 in AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, and AT-4, respectively, which indicates that AT-3 involved the optimal condition of TiO2 deposition on the annealed sheets through 30 cycles. Figure 1b shows that the optimal photocurrent density of T-3 that involved the same condition of deposition is 6.3 \u03bcA cm\u22122, which is evidently higher than that of T-1, T-2, and T-4. It is interesting to observe the difference between the two optimal sheets with and without annealing under the same condition. Figure 1c shows that the photocurrent of T-3 is about 15 times higher than that of AT-3.",

No characteristic peaks of TiO2 deposited on the unannealed sheets is observed here, but the element distribution shown in Fig. S3 confirmed the presence of Ti element, which implies that TiO2 exhibits amorphous phase. For AT-3, no diffraction peak of TiO2 could be detected due to the permeation of Ti atoms into stainless steel substrate for the same lattice constant of titanium and the iron. The unannealed sheets display the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ag crystal at 38.1\u00b0, 44.3\u00b0, 64.4\u00b0, and 77.5\u00b0 (JCPDS 04-0783). The XRD patterns of annealed sheets showed three characteristic peaks of austenite phase in Fig. 2a, while the peak in red frame amplified in Fig. 2b could be fitted by the combination of two peaks centered at 43.49\u00b0 and 43.62\u00b0.

The individual nanoparticles of Ag are uniformly dispersed on the 3D TiO2/PDA nanolayer formed on the nanopore arrays on 316L SS in Fig. 3c, where the average particle size is ca. 12 nm. After annealing treatment, the nanofilm structure was destroyed and was replaced by a coating of aggregate nanoparticles on the 3D nanostructure of 316L SS, as shown in Fig. 3d. The TEM image of Ag/TiO2/PDA coating exfoliated from the 316L SS substrate is shown in Fig. 4a. The bottom light toned layer of this image corresponds to the PDA coating, while the middle mid-toned layer represents the thin amorphous TiO2. The dark Ag nanoparticles with varying sizes were dispersed on the TiO2/PDA coating. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image for a selected region of Fig. 4a with dark and light nanoparticles overlapping each other (Fig. 4b) shows that lattice spacing of the dark nanoparticles is ca. 0.236 nm, which can be attributed to the (111) crystal face of Ag. The light nanoparticles without pronounced lattice fringes represent amorphous TiO2. According to the XRD analysis in this work and the diffusion trait of Ag in TiO2 nanofilm [42\u201344], Ag particles started to agglomerate and some Ag nanoparticles diffused into the TiO2 nanofilm during the calcination. The heat treatment decreased the distance between Ti atoms and transformed the amorphous TiO2 nanofilm to crystalline nanoparticles [44]. Meanwhile, calcination caused the carbonization of PDA, leading to the inlaying of a large number of graphite nanoparticles in the coating [45, 46]. Figure 5 shows a schematic of the synthetic processing of Ag/TiO2/PDA nanofilm, where the annealing treatment causes the destruction of nanofilm structure of Ag/TiO2/PDA and nanoparticles of Ag, TiO2 and graphite are non-uniformly distributed on the nanopore arrays on 316L SS. These aggregated nanoparticles forming a thin layer can accelerate the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The analyzed morphology and structure is consistent with the higher photoelectrochemical properties of T-3 than that of annealed sheets.",

The contribution of PDA nanofilm as plausible support to the photocatalytic mechanism is confirmed by the efficient electron transfer process.

To this end, the effect of visible light illumination on the bacteria surviving on control samples was studied by comparing the control samples with and without irradiation. It is evident from Fig. 8 that the survival rate for control samples illuminated by flashlight significantly decreased as the time increased from 10 min to 24 h as compared to the samples in dark. During the first 3 h of irradiation, the bacteria on the control samples were pretty much unaffected by the flashlight with a survival rate of ca. 85%. After 12 h, the visible light irradiation caused self-destruction of the bacteria, which may be attributed to the photocatalytic performance of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3\u2013Cr2O3 heterojunction according to an earlier study [36]. Hence, the optimal irradiation time of 3 h was applied in the subsequent tests. Figure 9 shows the snapshots of control SS, Ag/TiO2/PDA SS, and annealed Ag/TiO2/PDA SS exposed to visible light for 3 h. After the antibacterial test, no bacterial colonies were present in the plate containing Ag/TiO2/PDA SS, while the number of bacterial colonies in plates containing control SS and annealed Ag/TiO2/PDA SS exceeded the effective colony number of 300 according to the national standard of GB 47,892\u20132010. This stark contrast in the antibacterial properties of Ag/TiO2/PDA SS and annealed Ag/TiO2/PDA SS can be proved by the difference in the number of bacterial colonies. This result is consistent with the photoelectrochemical properties studies in the previous subsection.",

The antibacterial rate of Ag/TiO2/PDA SS exposed to the visible light from flashlight is over 99%. Even in the initial 10 min, the Ag/TiO2/PDA SS under visible light illumination starts to kill the bacteria, while the Ag/TiO2/PDA SS in dark exhibits faint inhibition.

This indicates that the enhanced antibacterial activities can be attributed to the photocatalytical properties of Ag/TiO2/PDA nanofilm irradiated by the flashlight. Compared to the earlier reports on SS shown in Table 1, the adhesion time of bacteria on the surface of the samples is normally over 0.5 h as they exhibit inhibition properties. The antibacterial activity of 316L SS under visible light illumination has not been studied before.
