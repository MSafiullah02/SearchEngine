The virus causes disease that ranges from mild to severe in its natural hosts, domestic pigs and wild boars. Classical swine fever virus is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 300 nucleotides. The genome encodes a single open reading frame that is flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends. Classical swine fever virus is currently categorized into three genotypes: 1, 2 and 3 that can be further divided into 11 subtypes: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 (Lowings et al., 1996; Paton et al., 2000; Postel et al., 2013) . Other pestiviruses that infect livestock are bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and type 2 (BVDV-2), border disease virus (BDV) of sheep, the recently described atypical pestiviruses (Schirrmeier et al., 2004; St ahl et al., 2010) and Bungowannah virus (Kirkland et al., 2007) . Classical swine fever (CSF) is an OIE-listed notifiable disease that can have an enormous effect on the livestock industry and on trade. For instance, the direct costs of the 1997-1998 epizootic in the Netherlands, excluding loss of exports, amounted to $2 billion (U.S.) and the slaughter of approximately 10 million pigs (Terpstra and de Smit, 2000) .

Virus isolation is the method of choice for discovering infected herds at the early stage of infection (Terpstra and de Smit, 2000) . However, rapid and sensitive tests for early detection of CSFV are desirable for containing outbreaks as conventional virus isolation procedures are time-consuming and require cell culture infrastructure and expertise. Several conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays have been described for detection of CSFV and other pestiviruses (Handel et al., 2004; Hoffmann et al., 2005 Hoffmann et al., , 2011 Risatti et al., 2005; Wernike et al., 2013) . However, the high cost of current real-time PCR devices, and the need for postamplification processing with conventional PCR may be a barrier to the widespread use of these technologies in field applications or in developing countries.

Classical swine fever virus 5 0 UTR-specific primer and probe set were designed according to the recommended principles for iiPCR (http://www.iipcr.com/eweb/ uploadfile/20130522114104277.pdf). The recommended length of the primers was between 18 and 30 bases, have a GC content of 45-60% and a T m of 56-60\u00b0C. Repeat sequences, four or more consecutive Gs or Cs and hairpins and primer dimers were avoided.

In this study, seven (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1) of eight subgenotypes tested were detected, but the assay failed to detect the genotype 3.4 Kanagawa strain, perhaps due to mismatches with the primers used in the assay (Chowdry et al., 2014) . The LAMP-LFD assay had an analytical sensitivity of approximately 100 copies per reaction on the two genotypes tested. In contrast, the iiRT-PCR described in this study detected strains representing all eight subgenotypes tested, including the Kanagawa strain, and had a limit of detection of about 23 copies, suggesting the iiRT-PCR assay has broader coverage and may be more sensitive than the LAMP-LFD assay. Both the RT-LAMP and iiRT-PCRs are simple to perform and can be completed in approximately an hour. RT-LAMP assays can be performed with just a water bath or heat block and results can be visualized without instrumentation. Thus, LAMP assays that do not require a signal detector may be less costly to perform than iiRT-PCR if cost, and not sensitivity is the primary concern. However, genetic variations of target viruses can have a big impact on the sensitivity and reliability of a LAMP assay due to the use of 4-6 primers. Thus, use of LAMP assays where broader genetic variation of CSFV may be encountered will require further validation with more genetically diverse CSFV and non-CSFV samples. The iiRT-PCR assay for CSFV reported here is commercially available and utilizes lyophilized reagents, while the LAMP assays for CSFV detection reported to date are in-house assays using wet reagents. Thus, further development and validation of the LAMP assays using lyophilized reagents are desirable for on-farm detection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 186, "text": "(Notomi et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 410, "end": 429, "text": "(Chen et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 430, "end": 447, "text": "Yin et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 448, "end": 467, "text": "Zhang et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 769, "end": 791, "text": "(Chowdry et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1046, "text": "(Chowdry et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The compact POCKIT TM Nucleic Acid Analyzer instrument with its lyophilized reagents and automated data analysis and result readout is easy to use. The requirement for a separate RNA extraction step requiring additional instrumentation and the maximum throughput of eight samples per run for the instrument used in this study may hinder its use as an instrument for high-throughput applications in the laboratory and at the point-of-need. However, an instrument with a throughput of 24 samples per run is available and with the high sensitivity of the iiRT-PCR assay, pooling of samples should be feasible. In combination with existing commercial portable automated nucleic acid extraction systems, the POCKIT TM Nucleic Acid Analyzer, may have potential as a low-throughput automated two-step method for on-site detection. The observation that low volume of serum can be used directly in iiRT-PCR without nucleic acid extraction can potentially simplify the diagnostic workflow considerably in the laboratory and in the field, and shorten the time needed to obtain results from serum samples to <1 h.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Phylogenetic analysis of classical swine fever virus isolates from Peru", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Arainga", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Hisanaga", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Hills", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Handel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Rivera", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Pasick", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "Transbound.
