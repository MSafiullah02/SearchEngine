We examine how ex ante management is an opportunity to influence the ex post conditions, which in turn affect the ex post optimal outcome. To capture these ex ante management choices, we extend the Poisson \"collapse\" model of Reed and Heras (Bull Math Biol 54:185-207, 1992) to allow for endogenous initial conditions and ex post multistability. We account for two uncertain processes: the introduction and establishment of the pathogen. Introduction is conditional on anthropogenic investments in prevention, and both random processes are conditional on how we manage the native population to provide natural prevention of invasion and natural insurance against establishment placing the system in an undesirable basin of attraction. We find that both multi-stability of the invaded system and these uncertainty processes can create economic non-convexities that yield multiple candidate solutions to the ex ante optimization problem. Additionally, we illustrate how the nature of B David Finnoff",

Infectious diseases affect how ecological communities are structured and are a significant factor in biodiversity declines (Hatcher et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009a, b; MEA 2005) , one of the greatest environmental risks facing society (MEA 2005; Tschirhart 2009 ). It is predicted that pathogen introductions may soon achieve a status similar to invasive species, the second most important cause of extinction (Daszak et al. 2000) . means the conditions of the system at the time of the outbreak might critically affect ex post outcomes (Dasgupta and M\u00e4ler 2003; Brock and Starrett 2003) . 3 Finnoff et al. (2016) recently examined the optimal ex ante management of a native species when this management affects the likelihood and magnitude of a potential non-native species invasion. They showed how both the bioeconomic multi-stability of the invaded system and uncertainty about the invasion can create economic non-convexities that yield multiple candidate solutions to the ex ante optimization problem. In their model, the native species acted as a form of natural insurance-cum-prevention: a larger stock of the native species had the dual effect of reducing the likelihood of an invasion, and of increasing the likelihood that any invasion would lead to the more desirable basin of attraction.",

This analysis is based on Finnoff et al.'s (2016) model, except that we introduce a key difference in the nature of the endogenous risks. Specifically, the wildlife population does not provide natural insurance-cum-prevention in the current setting. A larger wildlife stock does provide natural insurance in our model. However, a larger and denser wildlife stock is subject to greater invasion risks, at least for some densities. This means we have a compound probability problem in which the wildlife stock has opposing effects on the two forms of protection, prevention and insurance (also see Finnoff et al. 2013 on compound lotteries in endogenous risk models). This means the net effect of conservation on protection endogenously depends on whether the natural insurance or natural prevention effect of natural capital dominates at the current state. Moreover, investments in anthropogenic prevention and in natural capital are complements for conveying prevention in our model, whereas they are always substitutes in Finnoff et al.'s (2016) analysis. This has implications for the mix of controls.",

Ex post, the number of infected animals is denoted I and the number of healthy but susceptible animals is denoted S, with N = S + I.

The analytical solution for h(S, I ) is too complex to present or interpret here. Instead, we rely on a numerical example with the parameter values p = 20, c = 400, r = 0.05, \u03b1 = 0.25, K = 100, \u03b2 = 0.005, and \u03b4 = 0.2. This numerical example results in h(S, I ) being defined along the separatrices, or saddle path, associated with a saddle point equilibrium. Specifically, the saddle path is defined as a locus of points, or a trajectory, in the state space along which h(S, I ) is non-negative and finite. Non-singular solutions are optimal for combinations of states not on the saddle path. These results mean we need to examine the state space to analyze the solution. Figure 1 presents the solution to the ex post problem as a feedback control diagram (Clark 2005) , under the assumption that impulse controls are applied when \u2202 H ex post \u2202h > 0. This diagram illustrates areas of the state space where the controls are applied differently, with the associated dynamics as indicated by the vector fields. The saddle path, S * (I ), is the trajectory to the saddle point equilibrium A. 4 This path involves h(S, I ) > 0 along S * (I ) except at the intersection of S * (I ) and\u015c (I ) where h(S, I ) = 0. For initial conditions below S * (I ) and to the right of\u015c (I ), \u2202 H ex post \u2202h < 0 and so h = 0 is optimal in this region. 5 For initial conditions above S * (I ) and to the right of\u015c (I ), \u2202 H ex post \u2202h > 0 and so an impulse control is optimal in this region.

However, since N T is endogenous in our ex ante model, with its value able to change considerably, we calibrate \u03bb to depend on N T such that the expected rate of initial infection is increasing in the wildlife density (i.e., a larger value of I T is expected; evidence for such a relation is provided by Gilligan and van den Bosch 2008) . Note that the pdf \u03c6 does not depend on prevention effort. Essentially, we are assuming that once an invasion occurs (the likelihood of which is determined by a separate probability, described in the next section, that does depend on prevention efforts), the level of establishment at the time of detection, I T , depends solely on early interactions with the wildlife population. 6 The pdf can be used to calculate the probability that the ex post system will begin in the undesirable basin of attraction. The results are illustrated in Fig. 2a . For very small I T , any infection is likely to infect a significant proportion of the stock (e.g., since even one infected animal represents ten percent of the population when N = 10) and so there is a significant probability (8%) of being in the undesirable basin. This probability initially declines in N T but soon increases in N T as a larger N T provides more opportunities for early spread (affecting our calibrated pdf \u03c6). The maximum probability (twelve percent) occurs when N T = 40. The probability then diminishes in N T for N T > 40, as the effect of N T on early spread is dominated by the fact that larger stock sizes make it more economic for managers to pursue equilibrium A in the good basin. We refer to the effect of a larger N T increasing the likelihood of being in a bad basin as a natural hazard, and the effect of a larger N T reducing the likelihood of being in the bad basin of attraction as natural insurance.",

The relatively large wildlife stock levels in this case means invasion will be likely without significant, costly investments in prevention. However, the significant amount of insurance being conveyed in this case means that further investments in prevention are not worthwhile: society is willing to forego doing anything more to prevent the invasion (z = 0) since enough costs have already been incurred to make the ex post outcome relatively safe.

These terms represent the own rate of return in standard resource models without disease risks (Clark 2005) , and so we denote R R F (N ) as the risk-free own rate of return. In standard resource models, the golden rule condition r = R R F (N ) determines the risk-free singular solution for N , which we denote here as N R F .

The condition balances the return from managing disease risk (RHS) with the required return r net of the generated risk-free return (the left hand side [LHS] , the required net return to managing disease risk). If reduced conservation protects against both risks or if the effect on prevention dominates, then both sides of (15) are negative and the singular value of N is likely smaller than the risk-free value N R F given standard assumptions about the terms in R R F (N ). The opposite may occur if the natural insurance effect of conservation dominates. We illustrate the ex ante model by extending the ex post numerical example to include our estimated W (N ) and a hazard function that follows our assumptions, \u03c8(N , z) = 0.15 + 0.01N \u2212 0.07z 0.5 . Increases in N are risky, and so a reduction in N conveys protection in a relative sense. In contrast, z conveys prevention in an absolute sense. Figure Equilibria N C * and N E * are locally stable. This is because R R (N ) > r \u2212 R R F (N ) to the left of N C * and N E * , so that the return to managing disease risk exceeds the required net return to managing disease risk, whereas the opposite is true to the right of N C * and N E * . As N C * is unchanging over time, the singular harvest rate associated with this equilibrium is given by the stationary harvest level h C * N C * = g N C * . The values of z N C * , \u03c1 N C * , and \u03b3 N C * are also constant in the singular outcome. Analogous results arise for equilibrium N E * . Consider the smallest singular value, N C * . At this value, the conservation-related return to disease control is negative, i.e., R R (N ) < 0. This is because the population is too small to support large ex post capital values relative to ex ante values, i.e., (pN \u2212 c) > W N (N ), in part due to the risk of landing in the undesirable basin of attraction ex post being at its peak (see Fig. 2b ). The golden rule then requires the risk-free return to conservation to exceed the discount rate such that the required return to disease control is negative, r \u2212 R R F (N ) < 0. The result is a small singular wildlife stock N C * relative to the risk-free level N R F , which is the opposite of Finnoff et al.'s (2016) result due to the opposite effect of N on prevention in the current setting.",

Figure 5a indicates the optimal response is to invest heavily in prevention, such that z(N ) is essentially maximized at N C * and \u03c8(N , z(N )) is essentially minimized at this point (Fig. 5b) . This is in spite of the fact that the reduction in N relative to the risk-free value already conveys some level of prevention. Together, these complementary investments make \u03c8 N C * , z N C * small such that invasion is unlikely at N C * relative to higher stock levels. Finnoff et al. (2016) also find that \u03c8 is minimized in the neighborhood of the small-stock equilibrium, although in their model large investments in anthropogenic prevention substituted for a relative lack of natural prevention at this equilibrium. These results mean tradeoffs involving the two types of risks-invasion risks and the risk of alighting in the undesirable basin of attraction-and the two types of natural protection against these risks, can play an important role in the allocation of anthropogenic and natural investments. Now consider the largest singular value, N E * . The return to disease control, R R (N ) > 0, is positive at this value due to a larger wildlife population protecting against capital losses, i.e., W N (N ) > (pN -c) . The golden rule then requires the risk-free return to conservation to be positive, r \u2212 R R F (N ) > 0, and the singular wildlife stock N E * exceeds N R F . While the risk of invasion is larger at N E * than at values of N < N E * , any invasion that does occur at N E * is more likely to lead to an ex post outcome in the desirable basin of attraction for equilibrium A in Fig. 1 . Expected losses \u03c8\u03b3 would be small at N E * due to a small \u03b3 N E * , and so it is optimal to invest in no prevention (Fig. 5) . The result is that \u03c8(N , (N ) = 0) is large enough at this point (Fig. 5b) so that an invasion is quite likely.",

Yet most economic models exploring how to manage wildlife risks take these initial conditions as exogenous, which implies that the pathogen invasion is unanticipated.

(2016) , who model wildlife conservation as an investment in both natural prevention (reducing the likelihood of invasion) and natural insurance (reducing the economic consequences of an invasion), our problem is more nuanced because wildlife conservation as an investment in natural insurance but a divestment in natural prevention. These opposing effects of conservation have potentially important implications for the allocation of natural versus anthropogenic prevention. For instance, one equilibrium stock is lower than risk-free value, in contrast to Finnoff et al. (2016) , because the smaller stock conveys natural prevention relative to larger stocks (i.e., the degree to which the stock facilitates invasion is reduced). This effect might suggest less of a need for anthropogenic investments in prevention. However, at this equilibrium the probability of alighting in the undesirable basin of attraction ex post is at a high due to the small stock. This latter effect increases the incentives to make additional anthropogenic investments in prevention, such that these are maximized at this equilibrium. These results, which stems from tradeoffs involving natural protection and natural insurance, suggest a complementary relation between natural and anthropogenic prevention and contrast with Finnoff et al.'s (2016) results that natural and anthropogenic prevention exhibit a substitute relation. This means tradeoffs involving the two types of risks, and the two types of natural protection against these risks, can play an important role in the allocation of investments.",

Curve r \u2212 R R F (N ) is monotonically increasing and concave, with the risk-free singular stock level occurring where r \u2212R R F (N ) = 0, at the point N R F . Curve R R (N ) reflects the non-singular solution z = 0 in the intervals [N \u03c0 =0 ,\u00d1 L ] and [\u00d1 H , K ] (dot-dashed line) and the singular solution z(N ) > 0 in the interval [\u00d1 L ,\u00d1 H ]. The non-monotonic curve R R (N ) intersects the r \u2212 R R F (N ) curve three times to produce singular values of N , denoted N C * , N D * , and N E * . These multiple equilibria arise from ex ante non-convexities introduced by ex post non-convexities mixed with the uncertainty of invasion. In particular, they stem from the competing risk-protection effects of conservation at different wildlife densities.",
