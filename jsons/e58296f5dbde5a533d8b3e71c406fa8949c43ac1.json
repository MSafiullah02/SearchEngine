The pandemic declaration also stressed the deep concerns of the alarming rate of spread and severity of COVID-19. It is the first recorded pandemic caused by any coronavirus. It is defined as a global health crisis of its time and it has spread all over the world. Governments of different countries are imposing border restrictions, flight restrictions, social distancing, and increasing awareness of hygiene. However, the virus is still spreading at very rapid rate. Most of the people infected with the COVID-19 experienced mild to moderate respiratory illness, while some developed a deadly pneumonia. There are assumptions that elderly people with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal or hepatic diseases and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness [2] . Until now, there is no specific vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. About 2,940,979 infected cases were found in 202 countries until 26 th April 2020, where 203,822 deaths, 842,082 recovered, 1,837,424 mild and 57,651 critical cases were found [3, 4] .",

            "text": "It has been stated that in order to combat with the spreading of COVID-19 disease effective screening of patients and immediate medical response for the infected patients is a crying need. The gold standard screening method used for testing the COVID-19 patients is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on respiratory specimens [5] . This technique is the most commonly used method of testing for COVID-19 detection but is time consuming, laborious and complicated manual process with a positivity rate of only 63 % [5] . Moreover, there is a significant shortage of its supply, which leads to delay in the disease prevention efforts [6] . There are many countries of the world which are suffering with incorrect detection/count of the number of patients with COVID-19, which is due to not all the patients being tested and also due to delay in the test results [7] . These delays can lead to infected patients interacting with the healthy patients and infecting them in the process. It is stated that the RT-PCR kit costs about USD 120-USD 130 and also requires a specialized biosafety lab to house the PCR machine, each of which may cost USD 15,000 to USD 90,000 [8] . Such expensive and delayed test results is leading to more spread of the disease and making the scenario worst. This is not only an issue for lowincome countries but also certain developed countries are struggling to arrange this [9] .The other diagnosis tools of COVID-19 can be clinical symptoms analysis, epidemiological history and positive radiographic images (computed tomography (CT) /Chest radiograph (CXR)) as well as positive pathogenic testing. The clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 infection is that of bronchopneumonia causing fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia [10] [11] [12] [13] . Readily available and radiological imaging is another major diagnostic tool for COVID-19. The majority of COVID-19 cases have similar features on radiographic images including bilateral, multi-focal, ground-glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes, in the early stage and pulmonary consolidation in the late stage [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Although typical CXR images may help early screening of suspected cases, the images of various viral pneumonias are similar and they overlap with other infectious and inflammatory lung diseases. Therefore, it is difficult for radiologists to distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias. The symptoms of COVID-19 being similar to viral pneumonia can sometimes lead to wrong diagnosis in the current situation, where hospitals are overloaded and working round the clock. Therefore, incorrect diagnosis can lead to a non-COVID viral Pneumonia being falsely labelled as highly suspicious of having COVID-19 and thus delaying in treatment with consequent costs, effort and risk of exposure to positive COVID-19 patients. Currently many biomedical complications (e.g., brain tumor detection, breast cancer detection, etc.) are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) based solutions [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

            "text": "Deep learning techniques can reveal such image features, which are not apparent in the original images. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been proven extremely beneficial in feature extraction and learning and therefore widely adopted by the research community [24] . CNN was used to enhance image quality in low-light images from a highspeed video endoscopy [25] and was also applied to identify the nature of pulmonary nodules via CT images, the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia via chest X-ray images, automated labeling of polyps during colonoscopic videos, cystoscopic image recognition extraction from videos [26] [27] [28] [29] . Deep Machine learning techniques on chest X-Rays are getting popularity as they can be easily used with low-cost imaging techniques and there is an abundance of data available for training different machine-learning models. Concept of transfer learning in deep learning framework was used by Vikash et al. [30] for the detection of pneumonia using pre-trained ImageNet models [31] and their ensembles. A customized VGG16 model was used by Xianghong et al. [32] for lung regions identification and different types of pneumonia classification. Wang et al. [33] used a large dataset and Ronneburger et al. [34] used image augmentation along with CNN to get better results by training on small set of images. Rajpurkar et al. [35] reported a 121-layer CNN on chest X-rays to detect 14 different pathologies, including pneumonia using an ensemble of different networks. A pre-trained DenseNet-121 and feature extraction techniques were used in the accurate identification of 14 thoracic diseases in [36] . Sundaram et al. [37] used AlexNet and GoogLeNet with image augmentation to obtain an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.95 in pneumonia detection. Recently, several groups have reported deep learning based COVID-19 pneumonia detection [38] [39] [40] . Shuai et al. [39] used deep learning techniques on CT images to screen COVID-19 patients with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 89.5%, 88% and 87% respectively. Linda et al. [38] introduced a deep convolutional neural network, called COVID-Net for the detection of COVID-19 cases from the chest X-ray images with an accuracy of 83.5%. Ayrton [40] used a very small dataset (339 images) for training and testing using deep transfer learning technique using ResNet50 and reported the validation accuracy of 96.2%. However, this study was reporting the detection accuracy of COVID-19 images with normal images on a small dataset. The authors in this paper have prepared a comparatively large database of X-ray images of normal, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 positive pneumonia and made this publicly available so that other researchers can get benefit from it. Moreover, four different pre-trained deep learning networks (AlexNet, ResNet18, DenseNet201, and SqueezeNet) were trained, validated and tested for two different classification schemes in this study. One classification model was trained to classify COVID-19 and normal X-ray images while other was trained to classify normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia images.",

In experiment I, 190 COVID-19 positive images were used, where 130 images were randomly selected for training and remaining 60 images for testing. Therefore, 190 x-ray images were randomly selected from normal (out of 1341) and viral pneumonia (out of 1345) images to match with COVID-19 images to balance the database. In experiment II, in the similar fashion, COVID-19 images were randomly divided into training set (130 images) and test set (60 images). However, Image augmentation techniques were applied to make the 130 training COVID-19 x-ray images to 2600 X-ray images for COVID-19. Sixty normal and viral pneumonia images were randomly selected for testing. Image augmentation technique was applied to the remaining 1281 normal and 1285 viral pneumonia images to create 2562 and 2570 training images respectively. Several ML algorithms were trained and validated using five-fold cross validation on the training images for both the experiments. Minibatch gradient descent with 0.9 momentum, 16 mini-batches and learning rate of 0.0003 was used in this study. Testing of four different algorithms was carried out on 60 non-augmented images of different categories to evaluate the performance of each algorithms. In the Table1, summary of images from different sub-datasets were listed. Gradient Descent (GD) is the dominant optimization technique used to minimize the loss function. To avoid local minima in optimization, momentum is typically chosen between 0 and 1 and it was chosen to 0.9. Mini-batch gradient descent is a variation of the gradient descent algorithm that splits the training dataset into small batches that are used to calculate model error and update model coefficients. In this study, it was chosen to 5 and learning rate was 0.0003. ",

The scaling operation is the magnification or reduction of frame size of the image and 2.5% to 10% image magnifications were used in this work.

The strongest activation channels were observed and compared with the original image. It was noticed that this channel activates on edges. It activates positively on light left/dark right edges, and negatively on dark left/light right edges. Convolutional neural networks learn to detect features like color and edges in their first convolutional layer. In deeper convolutional layers, the network learns to detect features that are more complicated. Later layers build up their features by combining features of earlier layers.

The comparative performance of training and testing accuracy for different CNNs for two different classification schemes were shown in Figure 5 and comparative AUC curve were shown in Figure 6 . SqueezeNet is producing the highest accuracy of 98.3% for two classification schemes for both training and testing. ResNet18 and SqueezeNet were performing excellent in training dataset. However, SqueezeNet outperforms ResNet18 and other algorithms for test dataset. Table 2 summarizes the performance matrix for different CNN algorithms tested for the two different classification schemes without image augmentation. DenseNet201 outperforms other models in two different classification schemes in terms of different performance indices when the image augmentation was not employed. However, the performance matrix was significantly improved with image augmentation and it was observed that SqueezeNet outperforms other models in both classification schemes in this case as shown in Table 3 . Figure 7 shows the confusion matrix for SqueezeNet for two-class problem and three-class problem with image augmentation. It is clear from Figure 4 that the reduction of accuracy from 100% was due to the miss-classification of two COVID-19 images to normal otherwise this technique would reach 100% accuracy. This was true for both two-class and three-class problems. Moreover, a viral pneumonia was miss-classified to normal in the three-class problem. However, interestingly none of the COVID-19 images was miss-classified to viral pneumonia and vice versa. This is very important, as the computer-aided system (CAD) should not classify any COVID-19 patients to viral pneumonia or vice versa; however, it is important to see why the classifier failed for two COVID-19 patients and miss-classified them to normal. The difference between normal and COVID-19 x-ray images can be observed in the deep convolutional layer of pretrained CNN model. It is notable that from Figure 8 that the 14 th layer of SqueezeNet pre-trained model can detect features that can distinguish normal, COVID-19 and Viral Pneumonia images. This shows the reason of the success of SqueezeNet in detecting COVID-19 X-ray images and distinguishing it from normal and viral pneumonia images, which several groups of researchers reported earlier are not reliably possible by X-ray images. Figure 9 shows two images of COVID-19 with false-negative findings missed by both two-and three-class classifiers. The main reason behind the missing of two COVID-19 images is a less opacity in the left and right upper lobe and suprahilar on posterior-to-anterior x-ray images, which is very similar to normal x-ray images, evident from Figure 10 .

Four different popular CNN based deep learning algorithms were trained and tested for classifying normal and pneumonia patients using chest x-ray images. It was observed that SqueezeNet outperforms other three different deep CNN networks. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision of normal and COVID-19 images, and normal, COVID-19 and viral pneumonia were (98.3%, 96.7%, 100%, 100%), and (98.3%, 96.7%, 99%, 100%) respectively. COVID-19 has already become a threat to the world's healthcare system and economy and thousands of people have already died. Deaths were initiated by respiratory failure, which leads to the failure of other organs. Since a large number of patients attending out-door or emergency, doctor's time is limited and computer-aided-diagnosis can save lives by early screening and proper-care. Moreover, there is a large degree of variability in the input images from the X-ray machines due to the variations of expertise of the radiologist. SqueezeNet exhibits an excellent performance in classifying COVID-19 pneumonia by effectively training itself from a comparatively lower collection of images. We believe that this computer aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosing cases with COVID-19. This would be highly useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.",
