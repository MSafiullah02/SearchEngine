In these species, conjunctivitis is associated with infection by a variety of DNA and RNA viral families. Viral conjunctivitis may occur during generalized infection with concurrent systemic disease or localized ocular infection not associated with clinically detectable systemic abnormalities. Virus-induced conjunctivitis may be caused by direct virus-mediated effects during replication in conjunctival epithelium or vascular endothelium, humoral and cellular immune-mediated mechanisms, and secondary bacterial infection.",

Canine distemper virus or other viruses were not identified. Over the years, many conjunctival smears have been submitted to clinical pathologists requesting evaluation for canine distemper virus inclusions. This search has been futile in most cases. I have seen only 1 or 2 cases out of hundreds submitted.",

This procedure is particularly indicated if there has been a history of contact with other dogs in a crowding situation, such as a kennel or pound, prior to clinical signs of conjunctivitis. (LDM)",
