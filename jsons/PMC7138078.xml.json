            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis is an acute, highly contagious upper respiratory tract disease of chickens. Chickens of all ages and types are susceptible to the disease, which usually causes clinical symptoms, including rales, sneezing, shakes and diarrhoea. In addition, the reproductive tract of chickens can be affected, resulting in decreased egg quality and production (Cook, Jackwood, & Jones, 2012; Jackwood et al., 2005). When young chicks are affected, damage to the reproductive tract can lead to reduced production. The virus transmits very rapidly in naive chickens and poses an economic threat to the poultry industry worldwide (Jackwood, 2012).",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Coronaviridae family member possessing a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA genome enclosed by an envelope. The virus is made up primarily of four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). The S protein is the most important viral protein for virus subtyping because it contains epitopes for neutralizing antibodies and thus evolves very quickly by random mutation or recombination (Lin & Chen, 2017). The protein also mediates cell attachment and virus\u2013host membrane fusion, playing a critical role in tissue specificity. Therefore, changes in the IBV S protein can easily influence the virus phenotype (Cavanagh, 2007; Sjaak de Wit, Cook, & Heijden, 2011). In recent years, IBV variants presenting novel genotypes, serotypes or pathogenicity have been identified in China (Chen et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017), Korea (Hong, Kwon, Kim, Mo, & Kim, 2012), Egypt (Zanaty et al., 2016) and Australia (Hewson et al., 2014). These variants caused different degrees of mortality in chickens in experimental inoculations.",

However, IBVs locally circulating in Taiwan have been found to be genetically different from all other genotypes in the world and can be divided into two groups, namely, Taiwan Group I (TW\u2010I) and Taiwan Group II (TW\u2010II) (Wang & Tsai, 1996). Because of the lack of specific vaccines against endemic strains of IBV in Taiwan, IBV infections remain a problem in the poultry industry. Since 2002, IBVs causing severe outbreaks have been isolated from the field and subsequently identified as viral variants that emerged through frequent recombination events, including strains 2992/02 (Chen, Huang, & Wang, 2009), 3374/05 and 3382/06 (Chen, Huang, & Wang, 2010), and TC3/13 and S78/14 (Tsai, Tsai, & Wang, 2016).

Seven days after inoculation, the eggs were opened and examined for typical lesions caused by IBV infection (dwarfing or malformation). The neutralizing titre of each serum against the homologous or heterologous virus was determined by the last serum dilution that protected 50% of the embryo. In addition, r\u2010values were calculated by the method described by Archetti and Horfall (1950).

The S1 comparison (Figure 1a) clearly showed that the five variants clustered in different groups. IBV TC3/13 and S78/14, isolated from different geographical areas in Taiwan, share high nucleotide homology in structural proteins genes. In addition, the S1 gene sequences of these two strains were found to be clustered in the Japan group and share high identities (>94%) with the JP/Akita/92 and JP/Toyama/2000, isolated in Japan in 1992 and 2000, respectively (Mase, Tsukamoto, Imai, & Yamaguchi, 2004). In contrast to the result obtained from the S1 gene, phylogenetic trees based on additional 3\u2019 structural proteins (S2 and N, Figure 1b and c) showed the phylogenetic closeness of TC3/13 and S78/14 to other Taiwan strains. These results suggest that TC3/13 and S78/14 were generated from the recombination of Taiwan and Japan IBV strains. We, therefore, performed the recombination analysis. RDP4 was used to display the consecutive nucleotide identity and illustrate the crossover events among the queried strain (S78/14) and the parental strains (2575/98 and Akita/92). As shown in Figure 1a,d crossover event in the 3\u2032 of the S1 gene (nt 1,416) was suggested by the similarity plot. There was a significant difference (p < .01) between the resultant divisions of informative sites. IBV isolate S78/14 was therefore identified as an inter\u2010typic recombinant among the two putative parental strains. Three other variants, 2992/02, 3374/05 and 3382/06, have previously been reported to be derived from multiple recombination events with Chinese or Mass strains, and the recombination sites were located in the S1, S2, M and 5a genes (Chen et al., 2009, 2010).",

More apparent respiratory signs, including sneezing and coughing, began at 5\u20137 dpi. Severe clinical signs, such as depression, were only present before animal death.

In addition, lesions in the kidney were correlated with the outcome of death; in the S78/14 and 2992/02 groups, 4/6 and 2/5 chicks had visible urate deposits and swelling in the kidneys, which suggests that the predominant cause of lethality for strains S78/14 and 2992/02 was nephropathogenicity.

Therefore, we inoculated chicks with live H120 vaccine prior to the challenge with different strains of virus to assess the protective effect of the vaccine against each studied strain. From the throat and cloacal swabs, viruses in all three groups were detected, but the positive rates declined in a temporal manner (Table 4). Among the three groups of IBV variants\u2010infected chickens, chickens inoculated with S78/14 had the highest levels of virus detected from two swabbed sites across two time points, with positive rates of 78% and 89% at 7 dpc in throat swabs and cloacal swabs, respectively. For the 2992/02 group, which began with slightly lower positive rates at 7 dpc in the cloacal swabs, a similar shedding pattern was observed compared to the S78/14 group. At 21 dpc, 40% and 60% of viral shedding from the throat swabs and cloacal swabs, respectively, were still observed from these two variants\u2010challenged groups. On the contrary, vaccination conferred better protection to 3382/06\u2010infected chickens, with 50 and 20% of infected animals presenting positive viral detection at 7 dpc in the throat and cloacal swabs, respectively, and viruses were undetectable at 21 dpc. The group of chickens received homologous viral challenge or mock challenge demonstrated a low or zero detection rate for virus shedding. In addition to viral shedding, the challenged chickens were killed at 7 and 21 dpc to examine the gross lesions made by viruses. As shown in Figure 5, the results from the post\u2010mortem necropsy demonstrated that S78/14 viruses caused more severe damage to vaccinated chickens (the highest lesion scores among five challenge groups) than both 2992/02 and 3382/06 strains caused. The 2992/02 and 3382/06 groups showed apparent lesions compared to the Mass\u2010type\u2010 and mock\u2010challenged group. Taken together, our data point out that the current vaccine plan using the Mass strain as an immunogen is insufficiently capable of stopping viral transmission and reducing viral pathological effects.",

Using the RDP4 analysis, S78/14 was confirmed to emerge through recombination events between Taiwan and Japan strains; however, in the one\u2010day\u2010old chicken experimental infection, S78/14 exhibited increased lethality (67%) as compared to the 33.3% lethality caused by the TW\u2010I strain 2575/98 (Lin et al., 2016). Furthermore, a previous study has described the abnormal egg production of chickens caused by the infection of the Japan IBV strains JP8127 (Shieh et al., 2004), which is closely related to S78/14 in term of the S1 gene, supporting our finding on the oviduct tropism of S78/14. However, the number of examined female chickens in this study was relatively limited, and the experimental period was not long enough to observe pathological lesions. Further investigation using a defined group of female chickens is warranted to confirm this observation.",

Interestingly, similar age (approximately 30 days) of affected broilers was described from these reported infections and in our study. Given that most of the broiler chickens are maintained at a high density in Taiwan or other countries where commercial broiler operations are practiced, viral variants seem more likely to emerge from IBVs that co\u2010circulate in the farm during the breeding period. Therefore, in addition to the regular immunization, improved management and biosecurity practices may help reduce the viral emergence and control the disease outbreaks.",

The mild clinical symptoms and low virulence in chickens caused by the 3382/06 can be speculated that the recombination with the H120 vaccine strain attenuated the pathogenicity. However, to what extent the swapped genes influenced the viral virulence remains unknown. Similarly, although we have examined the structural protein genes (S to N), the link of sequence variations in other non\u2010structural protein genes to serotype changes observed from IBV S78/14 and 2992/02 in this study is not clear.
