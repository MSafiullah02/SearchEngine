Collective data from three veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the USA (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., West Sacramento; Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC), Cornell University, Ithaca; Real\u2010time PCR Research and Diagnostics Core Facility, University of California, Davis) shows that the overall number of ECoV qPCR\u2010positive cases has steadily increased since 2010 (approximate time when ECoV testing by qPCR was introduced by molecular diagnostic laboratories) and that similar to BCoV, the case number is higher during the colder months of the year (October to April; Fig \n1). The geographic origin of ECoV qPCR\u2010positive equids, based on zip codes of the submitting veterinary practices, is widespread across the lower 48 states of the USA (Fig \n2). Clinical ECoV infection has predominantly been reported in adult horses (Oue et al. 2011, 2013; Pusterla et al. 2013; Fielding et al. 2015). Outbreaks have predominantly been reported in riding, racing and show horses and less frequently in breeding animals. Two breeding farms in New York state have experienced ECoV disease. On one farm, a yearling Standardbred filly died from an acute enteritis and on necropsy, faeces tested qPCR\u2010positive for ECoV and IHC was positive for coronavirus on small intestine. No additional cases were documented on this large farm even though this filly was pastured with other horses. Another breeding farm with 30 American miniature horses experienced an outbreak with a morbidity of 83% (L. Mittel, personal communication 2015). One hypothesis behind the lack of large numbers of documented clinical cases at larger breeding farms is the frequent circulation of ECoV between asymptomatic young animals and adult resident horses, conferring protection against clinical disease in adult horses.",

This is supported by a recent experimental study in which three 9\u201310\u2010month\u2010old Japanese draught horses were successfully infected via naso\u2010oesophageal intubation using faecal material from a previously characterised ECoV infected horse (Nemoto et al. 2014) Two of the three draught horses developed clinical disease and all shed large amounts of ECoV in faeces. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is closely related to ECoV and considered a pneumoenteric virus, causing not only enteric disease but also mild upper respiratory signs (Saif et al. 1986; Tsunemitsu et al. 1999; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al. 2001; O'Neill et al. 2014). Recently, a French group screened 395 faeces and 200 respiratory specimens submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for the presence of ECoV (Miszczak et al. 2014). The samples had been collected from foals and adult horses suffering from mild respiratory or enteric disease. In that study, the researchers found ECoV by qPCR in a total of 12 samples (11 faecal samples and one respiratory specimen). In a preliminary study testing nasal secretions from 2437 horses with signs of fever and/or acute onset of upper respiratory tract infection submitted to a commercial diagnostic laboratory in the USA from January 2013 to December 2014 for the detection of common respiratory pathogens, ECoV was detected by qPCR in only 17 (0.7%) horses (N. Pusterla, personal communication 2015). Collectively, both these studies show that ECoV is infrequently detected in nasal secretions from horses with infectious upper respiratory tract disease, suggesting lack of tropism for ECoV to the respiratory epithelium. In the three experimentally\u2010infected Japanese draught horses (Nemoto et al. 2014), nasal secretions were ECoV PCR positive during the time of peak faecal shedding but it could not be determined if this was due to nasal replication and shedding of the virus or from environmental contamination from the positive faeces or both.",

Mortality rates have been reported to be low (Oue et al. 2011, 2013; Pusterla et al. 2013), although a mortality rate of 27% was recently reported by Fielding et al. (2015) in American miniature horses.

            "text": "Similar to BCoV the incubation period is short and clinical disease develops between 48 and 72 h after either natural exposure or experimental infection (Nemoto et al. 2014; Fielding et al. 2015). Clinical signs persist for a few days to one week and generally resolve with minimal supportive care. Occasionally clinical signs can last longer as recently identified in two ECoV cases from Florida that experienced colic and systemic illness for 14 days (L. Mittel, personal communication 2015). Shedding post experimental infection as documented by qPCR ranged between 10 and 12 days (Nemoto et al. 2014). Faecal shedding of ECoV under natural conditions has been reported to range between 3 and 25 days (Pusterla et al. 2013; Fielding et al. 2015; L. Mittel, personal communication 2015). It is not clear how long ECoV will persist in the environment and potentially act as the source of infection. It is reasonable to draw comparisons from other coronaviral pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) which has been shown in vitro to persist for 2 days in hospital wastewater, domestic sewage and dechlorinated tap water, while 3 days in faeces, 14 days in PBS and 17 days in urine at 20\u00b0C. However, at 4\u00b0C, the SARS\u2010CoV could persist for 14 days in wastewater and at least 17 days in faeces or urine (Wang et al. 2005). Enhanced replication of the virus in faeces in the environment during colder weather is one possible explanation for the apparent higher prevalence of test positive faecal samples and clinical disease during cooler weather. Equine coronavirus disease can occur in one or more horses on a farm with no recent exposure to new horses (T. Divers, personal communication 2015). Hypothetically, this might be explained by indirect ECoV transmission by nonequine animal species or that colder weather might allow increased faecal replication of the virus from a chronically infected horse.",

Pusterla, personal communication 2015). The main clinical signs reported were anorexia (98%), lethargy (89%) and fever (84%). The rectal temperature of febrile horses ranged from 38.6 to 41\u00b0C (median 39.9\u00b0C). Changes in faecal character, ranging from soft\u2010formed to watery consistency and colic were observed in 25 and 18% of horses with any clinical signs, respectively. Gastrointestinal signs are generally preceded by systemic signs of anorexia and fever (Fig \n3). These results are in agreement with recent outbreaks from Japan in adult draught horses reporting that anorexia and pyrexia were the main clinical signs, while specific gastrointestinal signs were observed in about 10% of affected horses (Oue et al. 2011, 2013). In 3% of infected horses signs of encephalopathy including circling, head pressing, ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, nystagmus, recumbency and seizure have also been reported (Fig \n4; Pusterla et al. 2013; Fielding et al. 2015).",

The white cell blood count in the 73 diseased horses showed leucopenia in 25%, neutrophilia in 66% and lymphopenia in 72% of the horses. The neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in these horses ranged from 0.2\u20135.1\u00d7109/l (median 1.6\u00d7109/l; reference interval 2.6\u20136.8\u00d7109/l) and 0.8\u20133.6\u00d7109/l (median 1.1\u00d7109/l; reference interval 1.6\u20135.8\u00d7109/l), respectively. Both CBC and differential were unremarkable in only 11% of the horses. Additional, less consistent haematological abnormalities included the presence of band neutrophils and shifts in monocyte counts (most typically shifting from a low or a normal count to a high\u2010normal or rebound monocytosis). Occasional rebound leucocytosis due to neutrophilia and monocytosis during the disease course and recovery was also observed. Complete blood count abnormalities are expected to resolve within 5\u20137 days as long as no complications associated with the disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier occur. Biochemical parameters may be unremarkable but elevation of total and indirect bilirubin due to partial or complete anorexia, electrolyte changes consistent with enterocolitis, transient elevation of liver enzymes and renal parameters suggestive of prerenal azotaemia have been observed in some of the cases. It is judicious to measure blood ammonia in horses with suspected ECoV infection and concurrent signs of encephalopathy. Fielding et al. (2015) reported a case of severe hyperammonaemia (677 \u03bcmol/l; reference interval \u226460 \u03bcmol/l) with encephalopathic signs that subsequently died. Hyperammonaemia associated with ECoV infection is likely due to increased ammonia production within or absorption from the gastrointestinal tract due to gastrointestinal barrier breakdown. An increase in enteric ammonia production could also be the result of bacterial microbiome changes associated with EcoV infection.",

The need for cost\u2010effective and timely detection methods has restricted the diagnosis of ECoV infection to direct demonstration of coronavirus antigens or specific nucleic acids in biological samples. Historically, coronavirus detection in faeces had been based on negative\u2010stain EM and antigen\u2010capture ELISA (Davis et al. 2000; Guy et al. 2000). However, the sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic modalities has not been evaluated and detection may be unsuccessful if viral particles are not present in sufficient numbers. Timely, cost\u2010effective and sensitive laboratory diagnosis of ECoV is through obtained faecal quantitative PCR (qPCR). A recent study evaluated the overall accuracy of qPCR and determined 90% accuracy between clinical status and PCR detection of ECoV in various outbreak populations (Pusterla et al. 2013). The authors have documented a few cases of ECoV infection which tested qPCR\u2010negative during early disease. These few horses ended testing qPCR\u2010positive on a 24\u201348 h recheck faecal sample. It is hypothesised that during peracute stages of infection, or when diseased horses experience gastrointestinal stasis due to colic, there are not enough viral particles in the faeces to be detected. The recommendation is to retest faecal matter in a suspected index case at a later time point or collect multiple samples for pooled testing. Viral kinetics of ECoV in faeces from experimentally\u2010infected horses showed that horses began to shed ECoV RNA in their faeces at 3 or 4 days post infection and continued shedding virus until 12 or 14 days post infection (Nemoto et al. 2014). Peak shedding is generally seen on Day 3\u20134 following the development of clinical signs (Fig \n3) and qPCR detection of ECoV in naturally infected horses can last for 3\u201325 days (Pusterla et al. 2013; Fielding et al. 2015; L.D.

This observation suggests that viral replication in the gut is comparable (L. Leutenegger, personal communication 2015) between foals and older horses. In coronavirus infections in man, viral load is a strong prognostic indicator for clinical outcome and mortality (Hung et al. 2009). A similar observation has recently been reported for ECoV (Fielding et al. 2015). The viral load shed in human patients infected with coronavirus is associated with polymorphisms of genes involved in innate immunity, an individual's genetic make\u2010up and immunological host response to the virus (Chen et al. 2008). In addition, coronavirus strain variations can influence the replication ability and viral load as shown with feline coronavirus (FCoV) which exists in two genotypes: a benign feline enteric coronavirus genotype (FECV) with low replication competency in enterocytes and a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) with an enhanced ability to replicate in different cell populations (Chang et al. 2012). Single point mutations on the spike gene are responsible for dramatic changes in cell tropism, replication competency and clinical manifestations.",

            "text": "Enteritis caused by ECoV has been suspected in foals for many years but the direct pathogenicity of ECoV has only previously been described in one neonate (Davis et al. 2000). Further, the high and similar frequency of ECoV shedding detected in healthy foals and foals with gastrointestinal diseases from central Kentucky suggests that ECoV commonly circulates among young horses with subclinical disease (Slovis et al. 2014). An interesting observation is that all ECoV infections in foals with gastrointestinal disease were associated with coinfections, while most healthy foals infected with ECoV displayed a monoinfection (Slovis et al. 2014). This observation may indicate that in foals, pre\u2010existing ECoV infection may predispose to opportunistic secondary viral, bacterial or protozoal infections as shown for enteric and respiratory coronavirus in other species (Pakpinyo et al. 2003; Srikumaran et al. 2007; Brockmeier et al. 2008). Other hypothetical reasons for the lack of clinical signs in foals infected solely with ECoV is that host factors such as absence of specific receptor binding sites or presence of ECoV\u2010specific colostrally\u2010derived antibodies prevent the development of enteritis. However, in the vast majority of clinical adult horses, ECoV is a monoinfection, demonstrated by enteric panel qPCR testing. This suggests a unique pathogenicity, coinfection with still unknown pathogens or a distinct difference in immunological reaction between foals and adult horses towards the ECoV infection similar to FCoV. The development of a humoral, cell\u2010mediated or mixed immune response against the highly virulent FIPV version of FCoV distinctly influences the clinical outcome of the infection. Interestingly, the clinical outcome of FIP has been correlated with a severe suppression of NK cells and T regulatory cells confirming earlier reports that a weakened cell\u2010mediated immune response is associated with fatal FIPV infection (Vermeulen et al. 2013).",

Horses with persistent elevated rectal temperature, anorexia and depression are routinely treated with nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs such as flunixin meglumine (0.5\u20131.1 mg/kg bwt q. 12\u201324 h intravenously (i.v.) or per os) or phenylbutazone (2\u20134 mg/kg bwt q. 12\u201324 h i.v. or per os) for 24\u201348 h, as long as their hydration status is believed normal. Horses with colic, persistent depression and anorexia and/or diarrhoea have been treated more intensively with fluid and electrolyte per nasogastric intubation or i.v. administration of polyionic fluids until clinical signs have resolved. Additionally, antimicrobials and gastrointestinal protectants should be considered in horses developing signs of endotoxaemia and/or septicaemia secondary to disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier. While hyperammonaemia\u2010associated encephalopathy only occurs in a small percentage of horses with ECoV infection, early recognition and treatment is associated with a positive outcome. Horses with suspected or documented hyperammonaemia are treated with oral lactulose (0.1\u20130.2 ml/kg bwt q. 6\u201312 h per os), neomycin sulfate (4\u20138 mg/kg bwt q. 8 h per os) or faecal transfaunation and crystalloid fluids.",

Due to the highly contagious nature of ECoV, any horse developing or presenting with significant fever, anorexia and depression with or without enteric signs (colic, diarrhoea) should be strictly isolated until a diagnosis is secured. Such an approach can prevent the quarantine of an entire horse population should ECoV infection be subsequently diagnosed. Once ECoV infection is confirmed, strict isolation procedures and secondary quarantine of the source stable of the particular horse should be employed. Post infection testing of clinical cases should be done to prevent viral spread to other horses. At stables and farms, all newly arrived horses should ideally be isolated for at least 3 weeks. Once an ECoV infection is suspected or confirmed, strict biosecurity measures including footbaths and the use of personal protective equipment should be provided and adequately maintained for sanitary purposes. Separate equipment, tack, bedding and feedstuffs should be used in the care of these animals. Grooms and other personnel should be instructed to work with these animals last in the course of their daily routine. Exercise periods should be confined to a time when other horses are not present in the training areas and riders should wear protective clothing and clean and thoroughly disinfect their boots, tack and hands after contact with such animals. Horses returning from shows or extended travelling events should be isolated according to their particular circumstances. All horse vans and trailers should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after use. Equine coronavirus is susceptible to common disinfectants including sodium hypochlorite, povidone iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate, phenols, quaternary ammonium compounds, accelerated hydrogen peroxide and peroxygen compounds. The examination of at risk horses for clinical signs of disease, including twice daily assessment of rectal temperature, remains the most effective tool in determining possible sources of virus introduction.",
