Around 1900, heart muscle diseases were mentioned as such, but it was not until 1960 that the term \"cardiomyopathy\" or \"myocardiopathy\" was used for the first time [2, 3] . Historically, cardiomyopathies or myocardiopathies were defined as genuine diseases of the heart muscle. This definition excluded as causes hypertension, congenital or valvular disease, pericarditis, and also ischemic cardiovascular disorders [4] . In 1980 the World Health Organization/ International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHO/ISFC) Task Force defined it as \"heart muscle diseases of unknown cause [5] . \"",

These phenotypes were considered primary cardiomyopathies, that is, as heart muscle diseases of unknown cause. Myocarditis or autoreactive inflammatory cardiomyopathy emerged as secondary cardiomyopathies. In 2000 a task force of the World Heart Federation (formerly ISFC) defined myocarditis as an inflamed heart with 14 or more infiltrating cells and also recommended assessment of an underlying microbial etiology [7] .",

In their position statement of 2008, cardiomyopathies were defined as \"myocardial disorders in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, and in which coronary artery disease, hypertension, and valvular and congenital heart disease are absent or do not sufficiently explain the observed myocardial abnormality. \" In contrast to the American definition, the European classification excludes ischemia or infarction as an underlying cause of DCM. If the ESC would have done so, DCM would have become the equivalent of heart failure. Therefore, in Europe ischemic cardiomyopathy is still a \"no go, \" and the term DCM is not used in the context of ischemia or postinfarction heart failure. However, patients with DCM may also have subtle coronary artery disease that does not explain reduced left ventricular function.",
