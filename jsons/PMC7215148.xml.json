His highest body temperature reached 39 \u00b0C, accompanied with chills, cough and fatigue. He disclosed that he had close contact with his son who had returned to Ruian on January 17 from Wuhan, China. Chest radiography, blood routine and 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was undertaken with suspected novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Only stripes of the lower lobe of the left lung was found by the chest radiography (Fig. 1\na). One day later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of Wenzhou confirmed that the patient's oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV. On January 28, 2020, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at local hospital.",

Some studies also found patients infected with 2019-nCoV had high amounts of cytokine, including IL2, IL10, and TNF\u03b1 [4]. Pulmonary epithelia damage leading to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be a consequence of a cytokine storm, consist of IL-1\u03b2, TNF [5]. Anti-TNF\u03b1 may have a protect effect as a decrease in serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 is associated with decreased lung injury and lethality in rats [6]. And earlier infliximab (anti-TNF\u03b1 monoclonal antibody) administration is associated with better therapeutic result and prognosis in patient with dermatomyositis with acute interstitial pneumonia [7]. Since no-specific treatment has been recommended for 2019-nCoV infection, anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy may be a potential treatment for NCP.",
