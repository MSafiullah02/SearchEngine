Since nasal sprays are moving towards being preservativefree, the chapter covers specialized methods of achieving a sterile product, namely, formulation strategies, manufacturing strategies, and the device landscape that support this upcoming platform. Finally, the chapter reviews various pathways for regulatory approval around the world, for brand and generic, with particular emphasis on the growing acceptance of in vitro data for locally acting nasal spray products.",

            "text": "A schematic of a human nasal cavity is shown in Fig. 5 .1 . Two nostrils, also referred to as the nasal vestibule, mark the entrance into the nasal cavities. At the end of the nasal vestibule, the diameter of each cavity decreases at a point called the nasal ostium (Newman 1993 ) . The septum separates the two cavities, which extend, on average, 12-14 cm from the nostrils to the junction between the nose and pharynx (Vidgren and Kublik 1998 ; Marom et al. 1984 ). This junction is called the nasopharynx. The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), an area that may be associated with inducing mucosal immunity, is located in the nasopharynx. Within the nose itself, the main nasal passage is further divided by three projections from the septum called turbinates (Pontiroli et al. 1989 ). The inferior, middle, and superior turbinates increase the total surface area of the nasal cavity to 150 cm 2 (Pontiroli et al. 1989 ). The total volume of each cavity is 7.5 mL. The nasal mucosa is lined with stratifi ed squamous, pseudostratifi ed columnar, and transitional epithelia cells (Adams 1986 ). The stratifi ed squamous and transitional types are mainly found in the anterior third of each cavity. Cells in this region are neither ciliated nor well vascularized. The columnar type, also known as respiratory epithelium, is located in the posterior two thirds. The respiratory region contains ciliated cells, mucous secreting goblet cells, and basal cells (Petruson et al. 1984 ) . The respiratory epithelium is also highly vascularized, innervated, and drained by an extensive lymphatic network (Pontiroli et al. 1989 ; Schipper et al. 1991 ) . The olfactory epithelium, which contains cells that provide a sense of smell, is located near the superior turbinate and adjacent to the nasal septum (Schipper et al. 1991 ) . The main function of the nose is to warm and humidify inspired air and to fi lter inhaled, potentially toxic or infectious, particles from the airstream (Pontiroli et al. 1989 ). Thus, the nasal cavity primarily acts as a defense mechanism by protecting the lower respiratory tract (Andersen and Proctor 1983 ) .",

Of these, inertial impaction is the most predominant for two main reasons. First, the air passageway constricts sharply approximately 1.5 cm into the nose at the nasal ostium (Mygind 1985 ) . This constriction accelerates the inhaled air and increases turbulence (Yu et al. 1998 ) . Secondly, the air stream must change direction at this constriction to enter the turbinate region. Particles that are large or moving at high velocity cannot follow the air stream as it changes direction due to their high momentum. Such particles continue in their original direction of travel and impact the airway walls, particularly at the leading edge of the turbinates. Because the drug-laden droplets for most aqueous nasal sprays are so large (30-60 \u03bcm) (Chien et al. 1989 ), a high percentage of the spray impacts in the anterior third of the nasal cavity (Hardy et al. 1985 ) . However, droplets that are smaller than 10 \u03bcm may bypass the nasal cavity and deposit in the lower respiratory tract, which may be deemed as a risk by regulatory agencies.",

The surface area/body weight ratios for the animals above range from 7.7 to 46 cm 2 /kg except for sheep that have a ratio of 0.2 cm 2 /kg (Illum 2000 ) . In addition, animal's nasal cavities are structurally different than man because they lack a third turbinate. To deliver nasal sprays into the nose of many of these animals, the animal needs to be anesthetized or sedated, which also can affect drug absorption. In short, animal models produce absorption results that fail to accurately predict the results in man (Illum 2000 ) .",

Since the drops covered a larger surface area, it seems logical that the drops would have elicited a greater response. In fact, the opposite was true. The drops were cleared faster by mucociliary clearance since they deposited in posterior regions of the nasal cavity (where cilia move the mucus layer faster). The spray was retained longer, allowing more time for absorption of desmopressin to occur (Table 5 .1 ).

For example, the deposition patterns from two commonly used nasal spray pumps (Suman et al. 2002 ) were compared in human volunteers. A radiolabeled nasal nicotine solution was administered in a crossover study. Deposition pattern was determined by gamma scintigraphy. The mean droplet sizes for each of the pumps were 47 and 53 \u03bcm for Pump A and Pump B, respectively. The results, Fig. 5 .2 , indicated that both pumps produced similar deposition patterns and that the Harris (1986) . Clearance of the radiolabel ( 99m Tc-HSA) was determined by acquiring images with a gamma camera over an 8-h period Fig. 5 .2 This fi gure shows gamma scintigraphs following use of Pump A and Pump B in the same volunteer. The nasal cavity was divided into a nine region grid. Deposition in the upper, lower, inner, and outer regions of the grid was calculated as described previously (Suman 1999) . The outer region represents the anterior portion of the nasal cavity including the nostrils droplets were deposited primarily in the anterior regions of the nose and along the fl oor of the nasal cavity. In this case, the size of the droplets determined the primary site of deposition. While nasal nebulizers have been shown to cover more surface area in the nasal cavity by decreasing droplet size (Suman et al. 1999 ), a simple reduction in droplet size alone does not guarantee an increase in the deposition pattern beyond the anterior nose. Nasal aerosols (Newman et al. 1987b ) that utilize propellants to generate the spray have been shown to have smaller droplets compared to conventional nasal sprays. However, the deposition pattern is even more localized because of the exit velocity of the plume. The droplets cannot make the bend in the nasal airway and deposit in the front of the nose. This also leads to slower clearance from the nasal cavity for the pressurized formulation as the droplets deposit on non-ciliated regions of the nose.",

When drug contacts these membranes, rapid absorption into the blood occurs (Laube 2007 ; Newman et al. 2004 ) . Unlike oral dosing, this absorption into the blood happens without fi rst undergoing enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract nor fi rst pass metabolism in the liver (other than the small amount that may be swallowed). Bypassing these metabolic pathways for poorly absorbed drugs allows comparable or greater blood levels, faster onset, and at a lower dose. These advantages (e.g., improved bioavailability, faster onset of action, lower dose) are particularly benefi cial for drugs with potential toxic effects on the liver. When delivered through the nasal cavity, only a fraction of dose that may be swallowed could potentially reach the liver, instead of the entire dose when orally administered. When given orally, all drugs that clear the gastrointestinal tract are then available for the liver. Systemically acting drugs could therefore be more effective and safer when delivered intranasally directly to the blood supply within the turbinates.",

Several reviews have examined adverse events associated with the use of preservatives (Lebe et al. 2004 ; Mallants et al. 2007 ; Bernstein 2000 ; Merkus et al. 2001 ; van de Donk et al. 1980 van de Donk et al. , 1982 .

Since the processes related to sterile manufacturing techniques, as outlined in the United States Pharmacopoeia USP <797>, are considered the \"gold standard,\" these processes have also been adopted by manufacturers of nasal products. USP <797> provides information on procedures and practices that may be adopted to prevent microbial contamination. The chapter discusses minimum quality standards based on state-of-the-art scientifi c information and the best sterile compounding practices. It is important to note that the goal of USP <797> is to provide a global view of the various practices that can be adopted to prepare sterile formulations across the manufacturing spectrum, rather than describe the approaches that can be adopted for a particular formulation. Hence, although USP <797> does not specifi cally describe the application of various sterilization techniques in the context of manufacturing nasal formulations, the general principles outlined in USP <797> still apply to the manufacturing of nasal formulations. Once the formulation is prepared under aseptic conditions using the principles outlined in USP <797>, the next step is to ensure that the nasal formulation delivered to the patient is free of microbial contamination. Therefore, it is critical that the device used for delivering the nasal formulation provides a sterile environment to the nasal preparation. For unit-and bi-dose formulations, a preservative-free pump is not needed because the formulations are designed for a single use. In some cases, the conventional pump used for multi-dose preservative-free formulations can be subjected to gamma radiation to ensure that the pump is free from microbial contamination.

            "text": "The orifi ce of any container is a contamination risk because it contacts the mucosa and/or skin, areas populated by microorganisms and body fl uids. Some marketed systems use the oligodynamic activity of a silver wire in the tip of the actuator, a silver-coated spring, and ball (Gro\u00df 2000 ) . These components control release of silver ions into the formulation over time. The system minimizes microorganisms between long dosing intervals, even when the tip is immersed into bacterialcontaminated fl uid (Bagel and Wiedemann 2004 ) . Silver ions are widely used for their antiseptic properties and are even used for wound dressings. They are safe and have no adverse effects. One must ensure, however, that the silver ions do not react with the formulation, e.g., chloride ions forming micro-precipitations. This effect may be overlooked because it is most relevant for spans of 6-12 h between individual actuations, intervals not usually evaluated during development. Consequently, the most recent preservative-free systems follow a purely mechanical approach to minimize interactions between device parts and formulation. One way to prevent contamination via the orifi ce is \"tip seal technology.\" Both spray pumps and ophthalmic droppers use this technology. A spring-loaded valve is located directly below the opening of the tip orifi ce, not allowing any microbes to migrate from any surfaces or contacted liquids into the system, sealing the orifi ce under resting conditions. The tip seal keeps the system closed until a defi ned pressure (for sprays it is more than 3 bar) is reached by actuating the system. Once a defi ned pressure is reached, the system opens and formulation is forced through the orifi ce at a higher pressure than needed to open the valve. When the pressure drops at the end of the actuation, the tip seal immediately closes the orifi ce with an outward movement. Therefore, no backfl ow of potentially contaminated medication or other liquid is possible. Depending on the pump system, the fl uid path may even be \"metal-free,\" which means the springs needed for the device operation do not come in contact with the formulation.",

Dry powder inhaler (DPI) systems were undertaken as an alternative to the pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI) that use ozone depleting propellants. Dry powder systems (both DPI and nasal) generally comprise a micronized active drug and suitable powdered excipients within an apparatus that is designed to aerosolize the formulation. Some of the advantages of dry powder drug delivery systems include formulation stability, a system that is propellant-free, and that less coordination between actuation and inhalation is required (Telko and Hickey 2005 ; Serra-Batlles et al. 2002 ) . Also, because of the absence of moisture in the dry powder system, microbial growth is minimized or eliminated, and the use of preservatives is less critical than in the case of liquid formulations. Deposition effi ciency, dose uniformity, complexity of manufacturing, and device to device performance remain as concerns for dry powder technology (Chan 2006 ; Islam and Gladki 2008 ) . Dry powder devices come in unit-dose, bi-dose, and multi-dose systems. Some of the container/closure systems currently available for use with dry powder nasal sprays are shown in Fig. 5.10 . ",

Samples were exposed to the verifi cation target dose, \u00b110 %. Calibrated dosimeters were used to verify the dose. After exposure, each sample was visually checked for damage and/ or compromised packaging prior to sterility testing. Sterility testing was performed by adding the test sample to Soybean Casein Digest Broth and Fluid Thioglycollate Medium, and incubating for 14 days at 20-25 and 30-35 \u00b0C, respectively. Bacteriostasis and fungistasis testing was also carried out.",

Often used in early development, nasal cast studies have become easier to perform with increasing ease in the creation of nasal casts from MRI and CT scans (Fig. 5.14 ) . With rapid prototyping techniques, nasal casts can be machined for use in a lab setting. These casts are typically coated with a material to simulate the mucus layer and to prevent particle bounce.

These tests are performed from the analysis of a twodimensional image of the emitted plume. Traditionally spray pattern and plume geometry have been performed with impaction systems such as TLC plates and fast speed cameras. Nowadays, spray pattern and plume geometry analyses are mostly performed using non-impaction laser sheet-based instruments. Spray pattern is characterized by the D max , D min , ovality ratio, and area. D max is the longest diameter measured on the resulting spray pattern image. D min is the shortest diameter measured on the resulting spray pattern image. Ovality ratio is the ratio of D max to D min . This ratio provides a quantitative value for the overall shape of the spray. The spray pattern area is automatically detected by the software. Percent area is the ratio of the spray pattern area to the entire image area. Plume geometry is characterized by the plume height, spray angle, and plume width. Spray angle is the angle of the emitted plume measured from the vertex of the spray cone and spray nozzle. Plume width is the width of the plume at a given distance (e.g., 3 cm) from the spray nozzle. Plume height is the height of the emitted plume measured from the tip of the device. While specifi cations may be set for all spray pattern parameters, FDA recommends using area and ovality ratio for statistical comparison (Food and Drug Administration 2003 ) to establish bioequivalence between test and reference nasal drug products. In case of plume geometry, FDA recommends using spray angle and plume width for statistical comparison (Food and Drug Administration 2003 ) .",

The droplet size distribution is characterized by the volume distribution (Dv 10 , Dv 50 , and Dv 90 ), span, and percentage (%) less than 10 \u03bcm. Dv 50 is the volume median diameter. It indicates that 50 % of the distribution is contained in droplets that are smaller than this value while the other half is contained in droplets that are larger than this value. Similarly the Dv 10 and Dv 90 values indicate that 10 % and 90 %, respectively, of the distribution are contained in droplets that are smaller than these values. Span is calculated by the following equation: (Dv 90 \u2212 Dv 10 /Dv 50 ) and quantifi es the spread of the droplet size distribution. Percentage (%) less than 10 \u03bcm is the cumulative volume of the particles with size less than 10 \u03bcm. This cumulative fraction provides a risk estimate of particles from nasal spray that may be inhaled into lung. For bioequivalence assessment, FDA recommends using Dv 50 and span for statistical comparison (Food and Drug Administration 2003 ) to establish bioequivalence between test and reference nasal drug products. Droplet size is also a quality control test.",
