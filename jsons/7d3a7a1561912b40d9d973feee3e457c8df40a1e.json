The diagnosis is particularly difficult among children in whom verbal communication is not yet developed (Wrotek et al. 2018) . The most effective way to prevent the infections among children is seasonal flu vaccination administered every season (Committee on Infectious Diseases 2017). According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the USA, a trivalent vaccine is recommended from the age of 6 months for the 2017/18 epidemic season (Grohskopf et al. 2017) . Unfortunately, the highest percentage of hospitalizations and deaths is recorded in infants <6 months of age (Zaw\u0142ocka et al. 2016) . To protect newborns who are at high risk of complications after influenza infection, a cocoon vaccination strategy is recommended. People from the immediate infant environment, such as parents, grandparents, or siblings, are vaccinated against influenza, which protects the child against the illness in a secondary manner (Nitsch-Osuch 2017). The quadrivalent vaccines, which have been already developed, are recommended from the age of 3 years due to the lack of available research in younger children. This study seeks to define the prevalence of influenza infection in the population of children up to the age of 14 years and of the type of prevailing influenza virus causing infection among children during the 2017/18 epidemic season in Poland.",

The material for the study were nasal and throat swabs taken during the 2017/18 epidemic season and analyzed in 16 Voivodship Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations and in the Department of Influenza Research, National Influenza Center in the National Institute of Public Health -National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH) in Warsaw, Poland. During the epidemic season, 1286 samples were tested for influenza and reported in the Sentinel and Non-Sentinel Influenza Surveillance System. The ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from the nasal and pharyngeal swabs. A Maxwell 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit was used (Promega Corporation; Madison, WI), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. From 200 \u03bcl of clinical samples, suspended in 1 ml of physiological saline, 50 \u03bcl of RNA resuspended in RNase-free water was obtained. Molecular tests were performed to confirm the presence of influenza A and B viruses and to determine the viral subtypes. The Light Cycler 2.0 System was used (Roche Diagnostics; Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The primers and probes were obtained from the International Reagent Resource (IRR) run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (at 50 C for 30 min). The obtained DNA was subjected to the initiating denaturation process (1 cycle at 95 C for 2 min), followed by 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 C for 15 s, annealing at 55 C for 10 s, and elongation at 72 C for 20 s. Positive control was the viral RNA obtained from the strains used for the 2017/2018 vaccine (A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, A/HongKong/4801/2014 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008/).

            "text": "The present report demonstrates the lowest percentage of influenza A in the oldest children aged 10-14. Further, infection with subtype A/H3N2/ constituted the lowest percentage of influenza A in each age group. This last trend seems to have been in line with the notion put forward by Adlhoch et al. (2018) suggesting that subtype A/H3N2/ may be the most common in older persons, particularly aged over 65 rather than in children. This report also demonstrates that unsubtyped influenza A was the most prevalent across all the age groups of children. This finding, however, may contain a spurious component due to possibly ineffective subtyping of influenza virus or occasional lack of subtyping it at all. Despite these limitations, we believe we have demonstrated in this report that there is a relation between the child's age and the type of influenza virus causing infection. In the 2017/18 epidemic season, the youngest children under 4 years were the most vulnerable to both influenza and influenza-like infections, the former caused mostly by influenza A and the latter by RSV. In contradistinction, influenza B dominated in the oldest children aged 10-14 and RSV infections were not present in this age group. However, characteristics of influenza viruses are highly changeable season to season. These data may thus not exactly apply to each and every epidemic season.",
