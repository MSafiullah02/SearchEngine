Zoonosen sind Erkrankungen, die naturgem\u00e4\u00df zwischen Tier und Mensch \u00fcbertragen werden k\u00f6nnen. Die Kontrolle von Lebensmittel-relevanten Zoonosen innerhalb der Europ\u00e4ischen Union ist eine Grundvoraussetzung f\u00fcr die Sicherheit im internen Handel und repr\u00e4sentiert demnach einen wichtigen Baustein in der politischen Agenda. Bedauerlicherweise war bis vor Kurzem das Schaffen eines klaren \u00dcberblicks \u00fcber das derzeitige Vorkommen von durch Lebensmittel verursachten Zoonosen und die Pr\u00e4valenz der diese hervorrufenden Agentien wegen des Fehlens von verl\u00e4sslichen \u00dcberwachungs-und Dokumentationsprogrammen beeintr\u00e4chtigt. Gleichzeitig wurde deutlich, dass europaweit nur begrenzter Erfolg in Hinsicht auf die Kontrolle wichtiger durch Lebensmittel \u00fcbertragener Erreger wie Salmonella spp. verzeichnet werden. Die Europ\u00e4ische Union hat eine Gesetzgebung verabschiedet, die diese Situation beheben und die Kontrolle von durch Lebensmittel \u00fcbertragenen Zoonosen in der Prim\u00e4rproduktion gew\u00e4hrleisten soll. Dieser Beitrag diskutiert die Anreize zur Einf\u00fchrung der EU-Richtlinie RL 2003/99/EG und EU-Verordnung VO (EG) 2160/2003, fasst ihre Kernaussagen zusammen und er\u00f6rtert die Hauptauswirkungen beider Gesetzestexte auf die Pr\u00e4vention von durch Lebensmittel \u00fcbertragenen Zoonosen. Schlussfolgernd gibt es in Bezug auf die humane Salmonellose einen Grund f\u00fcr vorsichtigen Optimismus, f\u00fcr andere durch Lebensmittel verursachte Zoonosen besteht jedenfalls noch Handlungsbedarf.",

The control of food-borne zoonoses within the European Union is a prerequisite for assuring a functional internal market and consequently represents an important item on the political agenda. Unfortunately, until recently, gaining a clear view of the current incidence of food-borne zoonoses and the prevalence of its causative agents has been frustrated by the absence of reliable monitoring and reporting systems. Similarly, it has become clear that, Europe wide, one has witnessed only limited success with regard to the control of important food-borne agents such as Salmonella spp. The European Union has adopted legislation to remedy this situation and to control food-borne zoonoses in primary production. This contribution discusses the incentives for introducing EU Directive 2003/99/EC and EU Regulation No. 2160/2003, summarises their essentials and discusses major ramifications of both pieces of legislation for the prevention of food-borne zoonoses. It is concluded that there is reason for cautious optimism concerning human salmonellosis, while for other food-borne zoonoses there should be a call for action.",

It appears that zoonoses represent the majority of emerging infectious diseases. Several transmission pathways exist for zoonoses, including those via food or drinking water, direct animal contacts or those mediated through insect or arthropod vectors, rodents or aerosols. In addition, zoonoses can be transmitted from person to person or from animal to animal. On the 1 st of January 1993, the European Union (EU) initiated its internal market program involving free movement of capital, labour, services and goods, including foodstuffs, animal products and live animals. During the following decade the EU found itself faced with several serious animal health and food safety problems such as the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic, outbreaks of classical swine fever and foot and mouth disease, and became increasingly concerned about the persistent problem of endemic food-borne zoonoses such as salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. The latter were often originating from foodstuffs placed on the market within the EU. It became clear that control of food-borne zoonoses was a prerequisite for assuring a good functioning internal market, not only for reasons of public health but also because national prevention strategies of zoonoses were inadequate and gave rise to unfair competitive advantages in the food trade.",

In its 2000 Opinion on Food-borne Zoonoses the SCVMPH concluded that there was a potential for significant improvement of the present food surveillance, control and inspection procedures, which -based on present knowledge -could revert the increasing trend in zoonotic foodborne diseases. The measures taken for combating zoonoses up to that moment were rated as insufficient. Hence, the SCVMPH suggested: i) introducing a new, more effective zoonosis monitoring system, ii) various measures that would create conditions to reduce the prevalence of zoonoses, and, iii) to consider adopting a number of new control measures [1] .",

Ideally, this is achieved by elimination of the pathogen at the most appropriate stage(s) in the food chain. Where this is not feasible the alternative is to incrementally reduce the risk at various stages of production by introducing 'hurdles', i.e. taking measures that limit growth of or partially eliminate pathogens. Obviously, the latter should be combined with consumer information on the residual risks prevailing and how to manage these. However, certain pathogens occur ubiquitously or are rapidly spread over Europe as a result of the expansion of travel and/or trade within the EU or with third countries (see Tables 1 and 2 ). This challenges the efficacy of the various national programs to control zoonoses.",

In a number of cases the primary food safety initiatives do not directly relate to human disease but are rather targeted at achieving a tolerable level (i.e. concentration or prevalence) of the pathogen in food and/or in animals. Risk reduction should be achieved through integrated initiatives from animal feed mills through to the point of consumption of foods of animal origin. One instrument to improve food safety is meeting so-called 'food safety objectives' (FSO) [8] . An FSO is defined as the maximum frequency (prevalence) or concentration of a hazard in a food at the time of consumption that provides -or contributes to -the appropriate level of protection. 'Performance objectives' (PO), similar to FSO's, relate to the acceptable frequencies or concentrations of pathogens in the food chain before the point of consumption.

Also, varying protocols and methods are used for sampling, analysis and reporting of one and the same zoonotic agent and/or disease between and within member states. Therefore, -the more so because member states do not consistently distinguish between diseases acquired domestically or those contracted during travel abroad -the currently available incidence data on human food-borne zoonoses from different EU countries are of limited value for comparisons between member states and also between years. Yet, it is particularly this type of information on human incidence coupled with information on prevalence in foodstuffs and primary production that informs the risk assessments for intra-community trade. A more appropriate approach to monitoring foodborne zoonoses in the EU is to meet the following objectives: i) to follow epidemiological trends in live animals and food; ii) to estimate the true incidence and disease burden in each member state; iii) to compare data between EU member states; and iv) to detect early outbreaks of human diseases. In this regard, the EU monitoring programs ought to be targeted towards the major food-borne zoonotic agents such as Salmonella, Campy lobacter, Yersinia and VTEC. A common definition of cases, terminology, sampling schemes, laboratory protocols and methodology is needed. Finally, through baseline studies monitoring is to be harmonised in terms of sampling procedure (at which point in the food chain, type of sample, number of samples and sample size, laboratory procedure).",

For instance, Article 12 of the Regulation reads: 'Alternative methods may be used if they have been validated in accordance with internationally recognised rules and offer equivalent results to those obtained by international standardisation bodies, as reference method \u2026' The wording 'at least equivalent or superior' would have been better. In the current legal situation it is entirely conceivable that the authorities will be faced with a cascade of not necessarily optimal tests. The fact that, the detection methods improve constantly, should have been the very motivator to -at least for a limited period of time -use one and the same test and once the decision is made to change the method, to rely on the superior one as the method of choice. If the major incentive for changing the legislation was the lack of standardisation and harmonisation, it is regrettable that test alternatives that could frustrate a true comparison between member states are still permitted. We wish to note this unsatisfactory situation, as it represents a challenge and in our opinion should in the next 5-10 years be remedied, so veterinary and public health objectives are not compromised.",

Consequently, the results are inevitably retrospective. In our view, efforts to accelerate this process are needed. Setting clear priorities and focusing on the major food-borne threats could be helpful. Another priority should be to detect emerging risks within the Community as the early warning systems of ECDC and the emerging risks monitoring become operational during 2007-2008. To this end, the rapid alert (RASFF) system for foodstuffs and feed should be integrated in the early warning systems on emerging risks.",

Both reporting agencies have different priorities (justified as these may be), but we fear that this situation may interfere with the efficiency of the communication between these agencies as well as with the quality of zoonoses reporting. To achieve a well-functioning wkw 19-20/2008 Food-borne zoonoses position paper 596 risk management process all three parties need to collaborate intensively. It should remain a priority for EFSA and ECDC to act as independent and impartial agencies, serving the Community's interest by providing scientific opinions that are in agreement, not tainted by political arguments and including transparent analyses of risks, costs and benefits. This represents our major concern for the future zoonosis control in Europe.",

So far, it appears that this enlargement has been rather uneventful. Great emphasis was given to training and upgrading of veterinary and food safety services and of food industries. Having made the collection of comparable data on Salmonella in poultry and pigs a priority appears in retrospect to have been justified, as this production system will be subject to Community targets in the immediate future. To ensure that coordinated monitoring is effective, the new zoonosis legislation provides the legal basis for the Community to pay 50% of the costs for testing, provided monitoring is conducted according to the technical and financial guidelines and is completed in time.",

For several pathogens such as VTEC, Liste ria, Yersinia and Campylobacter and for antimicrobial resistance, there is a lack of comparable data on the prevalence in primary production and foodstuffs in the EU.
