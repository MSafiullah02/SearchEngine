There is a high risk of neonatal diseases, and preventive and prophylactic measures against diarrhea and pneumonia are critical. For the 4\u201310 days after weaning, diarrhea caused by colibacillosis is very common (Zamora, Reinhardt, Polette, & Macias, 1999); the extrinsic causes are the sudden deprivation of maternal antibodies due to diet changes as well as variations in temperature, humidity and other environmental conditions that affect the immune system of the animal (Bojkovski, Vasiljevi\u0107, Stojanovi\u0107, & Rogo\u017earski, 2014). During the fattening phase (after weaning), swine dysentery is another problem, so the use of antibiotics is a common practice to avoid this issue. Antibiotics have been successfully used to control disease spread and to improve growth; however, their use is already prohibited in some countries, and research has been directed toward the study of growth promoters that do not affect human health (\u00c1lvarez\u2010Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Mart\u00ednez\u2010Lobo, Arguello, Carvajal, & Rubio, 2013).",

In particular, prebiotics act by stimulating several microorganisms that are beneficial to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, the addition of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product has been shown to improve the presence of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus (Price et al., 2014), increasing villus height in the small intestine and developing systemic immunity in early\u2010weaned piglets. Specifically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I\u20103856 is able to inhibit the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli induced pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, associated with an inhibition of the mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase pathway (Zongyong et al., 2015).",

The physiological action of probiotics depends mainly on the establishment of the beneficial intestinal flora (O\u2032Toole & Cooney, 2008), which decreases the competitive ability of pathogenic bacteria (Robles\u2010Huaynate et al., 2013). Probiotic bacteria can be viable microorganisms in wet, frozen and lyophilized preparations or as fermented products (Gagg\u00eca, Mattarelli, & Biavati, 2010; Utiyama, Oetting, Giani, Ruiz, & Miada, 2006). Most research published on probiotics and prebiotics has been carried out in newborns with the purpose of decreasing mortality caused by diarrhea; the therapeutic dose varies widely, from 110 to 1,012 viable organisms per animal per day, and the number of organisms must be enough to trigger a beneficial response in the host without inducing digestive disorders (Santos et al., 2016). Information on the combination of prebiotics and probiotics in pigs after weaning is scarce. The purpose of the present research was to evaluate one prebiotic and two probiotics and their combination to assess the productive parameters, intestinal morphological response and economic feasibility in pigs from weaning to 150 days of age.",

Therefore, the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides incorporated into the diet, at a dose of 5\u201340 g/kg, induces a beneficial population of microorganisms in different intestinal segments, maintaining the health of the animals (Mikkelsen, Jakobsen, & Jensen, 2003). However, the post\u2010weaning use of prebiotics and probiotics is very questionable; several authors (Fedalto, Tkacz, & Ader, 2002; Mikkelsen et al., 2003; Sanches et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2003) reported a lack of improvement in weight gain and feed conversion from 22 to 54 days of age. In theory, prebiotics can improve the digested volume as a result of the increase in microbial biomass, and consequently, the action of a probiotic is suitable (Lan, Tran, & Kim, 2017; Utiyama et al., 2006). In our study, the ADG response was greatest in T4 (combined use of prebiotic and probiotics), and the FCR improved throughout all the fattening periods. Another study reported an increase in weight gain with a combination of probiotics (Taras, Vahjen, & Simon, 2007), and the use of anaerobic fermentable products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been reported to improve weight gain in weaned piglets due to the increase in beneficial microorganisms in the intestine (Price et al., 2014). Therefore, the inconsistencies among the above\u2010mentioned authors can be explained by the type of prebiotic and probiotics used for each experiment. The inclusion levels of efficient prebiotics in feed improve the concentration of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the intestine, although high concentrations might affect the digestibility of nutrients (Cross, 2002). Prebiotics improve energy efficiency, allowing the animal to generate muscle mass and a desired body weight for the market (Branner & Roth\u2010Maier, 2006).",

            "text": "Atrophy constituted one of the most important pathologies in T1, as demonstrated by an alteration in the relationship between villus length and crypt depth, limiting the normal processes of water and electrolyte absorption, excretion (Acres, 1985; Arruda, Madson, Ramirez, Rowe, & Songer, 2016), and higher concentration of cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 (Nyachoti, Kiarie, Bhandari, Zhang, & Krause, 2012). The intestinal villous atrophy in T1 was mild in the ileum compared with the other treatments. Hornich, Salajka, Sarmanova, Ulmann, and Sedlacek (1975) observed the importance of atrophy of the intestinal villi in pig ilea in diets that did not include any additive or growth promoter. They concluded that atrophy not only affects the normal mechanisms of absorption but also allows development of pathogenic microorganisms such as Rotavirus and Coronavirus, which are important agents responsible for lesions of the intestinal epithelium. On the other hand, in other studies, reporting that enterotoxigenic E. coli strains do not cause significant villi atrophy, and when atrophy is produced in newborn piglets, it is associated with enteroinvasive E. coli. (Barker & Van Dreumel, 1991; Castillo, Mart\u00edn\u2010Or\u00fae, Nofrar\u00edas, Manzanilla, & Gasa, 2007). Microscopically, the ileum of T1 pigs was the most affected segment, showing congestion, bacterial adherence, epithelial vacuolization of intestinal villi, atrophy, eosinophilic infiltration, mononuclear infiltration (greater inflammation) and lymphoid necrosis in Peyer's patches, with the T1 pigs showing the most severe lesions compared to the other treatments. Lemos et al. (2005) studied the effect of probiotics and prebiotics added to the diet of pigs on the structure of small intestine villi and found atrophy when these additives were not included. On the other hand, the concentration of cytokines was essential and corroborated the presence of an inflammatory reaction in the ileum. TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 are proinflammatory cytokines that play a critical role in normal host resistance to infection, serving as immmunomodulators of inflammatory responses (Nyachoti et al., 2012). Both are primarily created by activated macrophages through many signals, such as ionophores, lipopolysaccharide, and antigenic stimulation by pathogenic microorganisms (MohanKumar et al., 2017). TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 are mostly derived from lymphocytes and macrophages, but it was produced at a lower concentration with pre\u2010probiotics; perhaps this type of cytokines is also produced by endothelial cells.",

            "text": "Probiotics should resist the low pH and proteolytic enzymes in the digestive tract (Hou, Zeng, Yang, Liu, & Qiao, 2015). The retention time, the mixture of material ingested with the gastric juices and previously digested food influence the survival of the probiotic strains administered. In the anterior part of the small intestine, the most important defense is the rapid flow velocity, which prevents the excessive growth of microbes when the microorganisms do not adhere to the epithelium. The presence of bile in this region also represses the survival and activity of microorganisms. In the cecum, probiotics have to compete with the native microflora already established in the healthy animal, but the rate of passage is slower, and the microorganisms establish more easily (Morais, Berto, Hauptli, Wechsler, & Trindade, 2010). In this area, the epithelial cells are continuously released and are covered by intestinal bacterial cells, including lactobacilli (Chiquieri et al., 2006; Yang, Hou, Zeng, & Qiao, 2015). In our study, the continuous administration of probiotics throughout the entire fattening phase maintained a constant proliferation of lactic acid bacteria; physiologically, the food particles take approximately 2.5 hours to pass through the small intestine (Choudhari, Shinde, & Ramteke, 2008), and during this time, it is difficult for the pathogenic bacteria to multiply quickly; consequently, the probiotics predominate (Estienne, Hartsock, & Harper, 2005). Lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus and Streptococcus spp.) generally predominate in the small intestine and help reduce the pH of the stomach because of the production of lactic acid and organic acids (Utiyama et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The immune system of piglets is fully functional at weaning, but it is possible that it needs to be stimulated to prevent diarrhea. Probiotics can stimulate the immune system, and hypersensitivity responses in early weaned piglets can be induced by components of the diet. The performance and health can be assessed by growth rates, the use of feed, the number of deaths and the occurrence of diarrhea (Rai, Yadav, & Lakhani, 2013). Other benefits that have been reported for the combination of prebiotics and probiotics in pigs are the stimulation of intestinal motility, mineral absorption, the elimination of ammonium and the stimulation of the immune system (Cross, 2002; Yang et al., 2015). In our study, the prebiotic influenced the majority of non\u2010digestible oligosaccharides, which can control or manipulate the microbial composition and/or activity and help maintain a beneficial microflora that in turn inhibits the growth of pathogens. The combination of prebiotics and probiotics improves the stabilization and survival of probiotics during their passage through the digestive tract (Zimmermann et al., 2016). Mainly, the ingestion of prebiotics can stimulate the activity of pre\u2010existing species, and probiotic strains, such as lactobacilli, bacilli and bifidobacteria, compete for adhesive access to attachment sites on epithelial cells, provided by mannose\u2010specific interactions which prevent colonization by pathogenic bacteria (Solis, de los Reyes\u2010Gavilan, Fern\u00e1ndez, Margolles, & Gueimonde, 2010). The combination of prebiotics and probiotics exert effects on mucosal barrier function and the responses of the underlying immune tissue of the gut\u2010associated lymphoid tissue. They can induce antimicrobial peptides against pathogens as bacteriocins and probiotics also produce the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells to enhance transcytosis of IgA through the epithelial cell of the gut (Cross, 2002; Hou et al., 2015), demonstrating the ability of probiotics to improve the intestinal epithelial barrier function.",

Economically, greater benefit was obtained when using 4 kg/tonne prebiotics + 0.800 kg/tonne probiotics in the food, and a marginal return of 7.5:1 was found. The administration of 4 kg/tonne of growth promoter based on prebiotics and 0.800 kg/tonne based on probiotics in the diet of pigs from weaning to finishing is recommended. This addition achieves an increase in weight gain and improves the feed conversion, and there is a net economic benefit of 1:7.5.",
