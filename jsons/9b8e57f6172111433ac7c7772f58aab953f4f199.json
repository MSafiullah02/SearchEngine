Patients with COVID-19 present with fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, however, some are asymptomatic. The majority of cases have favourable outcomes, nonetheless, older patients and patients with comorbidities may have worse outcomes (2) . SARS-CoV-2 spread mainly through respiratory droplet and close contact. Nevertheless, studies have shown that asymptomatic carriers can be contagious as well (3, 4) . Health care systems in many countries falls under tremendous pressure of an increasing number of confirmed cases, and many heath care authorities recommended two negative nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result 24 hours apart before discontinuation of hospital isolation (5, 6) . To this date, there are no therapeutic options approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention or the treatment of COVID-19. Current management practices consist of infection prevention and supportive care, such as oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation if needed (7) . Many studies have been conducted to identify effective treatment in order to cure symptomatic patients and to limit the transmission to the community. Different medications were proposed to be candidate for the treatment of COVID-19, some of these options focused on the use of old antiviral medications and testing its effectiveness against COVID-19 (8, 9) . There are contradictory findings against the effectiveness of antimalarial agents such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine on COVID-19. Many studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 (10) (11) (12) . In a recent clinical trial, HCQ reported to cause significant reduction in viral carriage at the day number six post inclusion, with around 70% of patients having negative nasopharyngeal PCR sample, compared to untreated patients (12.5%) (13) . On the other hand, a Chinese study reported no significant differences between patients who received HCQ and the control group regarding pharyngeal carriage of viral RNA at day seven (14) . Despite that there are more than 80 trials registered to investigate the effectiveness of these antimalarial agents against COVID-19 as a monotherapy or combination with other medications, these trials characterized by having poor methodological aspects and reporting (15) . In addition, the use HCQ might expose some patients to different life-threatening consequences such as cutaneous adverse reactions, fulminant hepatic failure, and ventricular arrhythmias (especially when prescribed with azithromycin) (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

Another single centre French study explored the use of combination of oral HCQ sulfate with azithromycin, and reported that this combination was able to negatively convert the nasopharyngeal viral load as tested by PCR in all studied cases in day 12 (21) . Accelerating the negative virus conversion allow for earlier discharge from the hospital and/or designated isolation facilities and facilitate a more efficient utilization of the health care bed capacity. In this study, we aimed to study the association between negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR conversion and different therapeutic interventions (HCQ monotherapy, as combination with macrolide, or as combination with antiviral with or without azithromycin).",
