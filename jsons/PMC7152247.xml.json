In practical terms, if a ferret that has not been vaccinated has a positive titer, this test can confirm CDV infection. A fluorescent antibody test can be done on conjunctival smears, mucous membrane scrapings, or blood smears to identify CDV antigen in cells.21 However, this test is useful only in the first few days of disease, and false-negative results are possible.

Because CDV is closely related to MV, vaccination with MV vaccine may offer cross protection at 5 to 6 weeks of age without interference from maternal antibodies.64 Otherwise, CDV vaccinations may be started at 6 or 8 weeks of age for kits from nonimmune or immune dams, respectively, and then continued every 3 to 4 weeks until the kits are at least 12 to 14 weeks old. At present, the recommendation is to revaccinate yearly. However, results of currently ongoing research demonstrate that antibody titers may remain high for several years, suggesting that boosters could be given less frequently. In other species, titers of 1:32 are considered protective, and in a clinical trial involving 66 CDV-vaccinated ferrets, average antibody titers were found to be over 1:1000 a year postvaccination (HL Heller, 2009, personal communication).",

If a reaction occurs, treat the ferret for anaphylactic shock with epinephrine, parenteral fluids, steroids, antihistamines, and oxygen therapy as needed. It is prudent to suggest that a ferret owner remain in the hospital for up to 30 minutes after CDV vaccination in case a reaction should occur.

Experimentally, an enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay can detect antibodies against influenza A and can be used to rapidly establish a serologic diagnosis.10 Antibodies against influenza virus have been detected within 3 days after infection.38., 41. More recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and in-clinic antigen detection assays like Directigen Flu (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), have become available and are able to differentiate between human influenza types A and B with a simple nasopharyngeal swab taken within the first 48 to 72 hours after clinical signs develop.
