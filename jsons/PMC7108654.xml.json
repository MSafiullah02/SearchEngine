Some rabbits were transferred among facilities each year before the breeding season based on an annual genetic management plan derived from pedigree analysis (Hays and Warheit 2004). Pygmy rabbits from Idaho also were maintained and bred separately in the captive breeding facilities at WSU and Oregon Zoo, initially to develop effective reintroduction techniques (Westra 2004), but beginning in 2003, 4 Idaho rabbits (2 males and 2 females) were included in the CB breeding population creating intercrossed rabbits. In our analysis, we included only CB, Idaho, and intercross rabbits born, bred, or dying at WSU for consistency in record-keeping and husbandry. WSU\u2019s Committee for Institutional Animal Use and Care approved all methods under protocol 3097, in accordance with guidelines approved by the American Society of Mammalogists (Sikes et al. 2011).",

During the first 2 years of captive breeding, we waited to repair rabbits until after juveniles from the previous litter had emerged from their natal burrow and were weaned and removed from the pen. Because rabbits are capable of postpartum estrus (Bautista et al. 2008), from 2005 on, we attempted to maximize the number of pregnancies within a breeding season by pairing females again within a week after giving birth, while their juveniles were still in the natal burrow. In our largest pens, females and males were kept together continuously through the breeding season or until the male was needed to breed with another female. At least 1 male was present in the pen when the female gave birth to allow for postpartum mating. Males remained in the large pens with the females through the end of June. A successful pairing was defined as a pairing that resulted in a confirmed pregnancy.",

We found that the greater the % CB pedigree of females or males, or both, the lower the probability of pregnancy per pairing, and the slower the growth rate and lower the survival of their offspring. On the other hand, litter size tended to increase with % CB pedigree, but % CB was a less influential predictor in that model. The relative contribution of the pedigrees of male and female parents, and the strength of these effects, differed among the production parameter modeled. The pedigree of the female had a greater negative influence on pairing success compared with that of the male, whereas the pedigree of the sire had a greater negative influence on juvenile growth than that of the dam.

We observed that only a small amount of outbreeding (i.e., < 10% Idaho pedigree) doubled pairing success. In addition, behavioral observations of captive pygmy rabbits at WSU demonstrated that rabbits with 100% CB pedigree took 5 times longer to begin reproductive chases and to copulate after a male was introduced into a female\u2019s pen than for male Idaho rabbits (Elias 2004). Furthermore, CB rabbits had twice as many copulations or attempted copulations, and CB males chased females longer before and after copulation than did Idaho males (Elias 2004). Similarly, in endangered volcano rabbits, captive populations had lower genetic and allelic diversity than wild populations (Salom\u00f3n Sota et al. 2005) and inbreeding was implicated as a potential cause of low reproductive rates (Campos Morales 2009).",

Similar diseases also were the primary cause of high mortality in captive volcano rabbits (Hoth and Granados 1987), but disease was not a leading cause of death in captive-reared European rabbits (Arenas et al. 2006). Adult pygmy rabbits in the captive breeding facility were unusually susceptible to avian tuberculosis (Harrenstein et al. 2006), caused by a ubiquitous mycobacterium that typically only affects animals with compromised immune systems. Because adult rabbits with 100% CB pedigree in our captive breeding program had a less vigorous lymphocyte response compared with animals with a mixture of CB and Idaho pedigree (Harrenstein et al. 2006), the low genetic diversity within the captive CB population may have contributed to high adult and juvenile mortality from disease. High mortality from disease may have been compounded by the necessity of housing rabbits on soil during the period from breeding through lactation because pygmy rabbits were unable to successfully raise young without a soil substrate for digging natal burrows (B. A. Elias, in litt.).",

No information is available about the effects of temperature and neonatal survival in wild pygmy rabbits, but natal burrows constructed in 0.5\u20131 m of soil above ground in our captive facility may not have provided an adequate thermal environment for neonates in the colder months early in the breeding season. Juveniles born later in the breeding season also had a greater survival to adulthood. Delaying breeding until temperatures are warmer, providing climate control, or providing deeper soil may improve neonatal survival in captive pygmy rabbits, although this delay would reduce the number of litters that could be produced per animal per season.",

Despite our expectation that older animals (those that had survived 1 breeding season) would be more productive because they may have more energy reserves and more experience, we found that pairing success and survival of neonates was lower for older dams or sires, or both, although older dams did produce larger litters. Females that had a previous litter that breeding season were more likely to become pregnant during a pairing and to produce neonates that survived until emergence, but produced a smaller litter. In contrast, Stott et al. (2008) found that litter size increased with the number of litters produced per female per year in European rabbits, and Rashwan and Marai (2000) found that shortening the birthing interval increased mortality in domestic rabbits. Female juveniles grew faster and had a higher adult mass, but sex was not related to adult survival.",

Juvenile survival was higher in early years of the program, potentially before some pathogens were introduced to, and compounded within, the captive colony. On the other hand, pairing success and juvenile growth were higher in later years, possibly reflecting advances in adaptive management such as diet, housing, cleaning protocols, and medical care designed to improve rabbit production. Because husbandry practices were completely or partially confounded with year, we were unable to examine their individual effects on production. Furthermore, discerning cause-and-effect relationships is difficult in a captive breeding program for an endangered species, which necessarily precludes formal experimentation that could be harmful to some individuals.",

            "text": "In conclusion, declining or endangered species most in need of emergency captive breeding programs are often similar to the CB pygmy rabbit\u2014small populations with low genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation from possible sources for translocation (Brekke et al. 2010; Rabon and Waddell 2010; Cain et al. 2011; Karsten et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2011). Consequently, difficult trade-offs (e.g., demographic, facility logistics, and financial expenses) often must be balanced to adaptively manage population genetics, population size, and production of enough new animals to support both a captive population and reintroduction efforts (van Heezik et al. 2005; Zeoli et al. 2008; Robert 2009). In our study, a modest level of outbreeding of CB pygmy rabbits with a genetically distinct population that had higher genetic diversity and larger populations improved pregnancy rates, juvenile growth, and juvenile survival. The default assumption that distinct population segments contain genetic complexes well adapted to local ecological conditions frequently may be offset by the potential for inbreeding depression in populations with low genetic diversity. Thus, we recommend that captive breeding efforts for rare or endangered species consider outbreeding as a potential response even early in recovery programs when fitness measures suggest compromised reproductive performance and survival. Under ideal circumstances, to increase the chances of success in captive breeding of endangered lagomorphs, we recommend frequent monitoring of size and genetic diversity of declining populations of concern and establishing captive breeding programs before such populations become as small and isolated as the CB pygmy rabbit. Captive breeding programs starting with a large number of unrelated founders that are supplemented annually with new founders and continue for a minimal number of generations (< 20) to avoid rapid evolutionary processes associated with adapting to conditions in captivity can be a key component of restoring endangered lagomorphs (Robert 2009; Witzenberger and Hochkirch 2011). We conclude conserving short-lived, relatively r-selected species, as may characterize numbers of lagomorph species, is challenging, especially when information on reproduction, population and landscape genetics, and associated fitness values is limited or nonexistent. Conservationists must therefore be prepared for the necessity of rapid adaptive management of captive populations, even when critical biological information is limited.",
