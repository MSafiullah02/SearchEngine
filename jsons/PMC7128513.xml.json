Various aspects of the pathogenesis have been investigated previously and most studies have focused on the ability of P. multocida to establish infection with or without different co-factors (Bentley and Farrington, 1980, Fuentes and Pijoan, 1987, Ciprian et al., 1988, Amass et al., 1994, Halloy et al., 2004, Halloy et al., 2005). In histological studies of inflammatory reactions in the porcine lung after experimental infections, neutrophils are found in all air conducting parts of the lung (Roberts et al., 1962, Berndt and Muller, 1995, Berndt et al., 2002, Ono et al., 2003). Furthermore, accumulation of T-lymphocytes in perivascular areas (Berndt and Muller, 1995) and macrophages releasing various cytokines in lesions (Berndt et al., 2002) has been described.",
