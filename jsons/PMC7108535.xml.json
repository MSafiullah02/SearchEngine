            "text": "WNV is a neurotropic member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, maintained in enzootic cycles involving several species of birds, which act as amplifying reservoir host, and mosquitoes belonging principally to the Culex pipiens complex, although other species would also support the spread of the virus (Marcantonio et al.2015). A study conducted in Italy between 2008 and 2014 detected WNV in three mosquito species belonging to two genera: Culex pipiens s.l., Culex modestus and Ochlerotatus caspius (Mancini et al. 2017. Humans, horses and other mammals are incidental or dead-end host. First isolated in Uganda in 1937, starting from the 1990s WNV has spread rapidly across all the continents. Climate change (warmer temperature and higher cumulative rainfall) could be one of the drivers that contribute to the changing pattern of transmission of several vector-borne diseases (Riccardo et al. 2018). Following transmission via mosquito bites, WNV replicates in keratinocytes and in the skin dendritic cells (DCs), Langherans cells (LCs), which then migrates to the local lymphnodes from where the virus disseminate to the kidney, spleen and other visceral organs. In about 1% of all infected patients, the WNV infection evolves to severe neurologic disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis and death. The virus entry to the central nervous system can be either via blood stream as well as via trans-neural pathways. Infection can also happen by blood transfusion, organ, tissue and cell transplants. According to the above, although most human infections are subclinical, symptoms can vary from a self-limiting fever to severe neurological disease (Ulbert 2011).",

Type I IFN receptors signaling in astrocytes regulates the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier and protects the cerebellum from neuroinvasive infection by WNV. Therefore, the negative regulation of IFN responses, by either host and viral factors, can contribute to the pathogenesis of WNV. In particular, NS1 protein of WNV, secreted upon infection, represses TLR3-induced IFN in mouse and human cells, thus favoring virus spreading in the CNS (Luo and Wang 2018).",

Ticks of the genus Hyalomma are considered both main vector and natural reservoir; direct contact with fluids, tissue or blood of infected animals are also considered transmission routes of the infection to humans. CCHFV is maintained and transmitted in a vertical and horizontal transmission cycle involving a variety of wild and domestic animals that act as amplification hosts without showing signs of illness. Despite these animals have been considered reservoirs of the virus, they develop only a transient viremia, while the virus can persist in ticks for their entire lifespan, and can be vertically transmitted to the next generation. Therefore, ticks are considered both vector and reservoir for the virus (Gargili et al.2017). Nosocomial transmission may occur through direct contact with human infected blood or body fluids or contaminated medical equipment or supply. First recognized in 1944, human CCHFV infections have been reported in over 30 countries in Asia, Middle East, South-Eastern Europe and Africa. Clinical symptoms usually comprise mild and non-specific febrile illness; in some cases, severe hemorrhagic disease can develop (Wang and Crameri 2014).",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of CCHFV infection in humans is mainly based on immunopathogenetic mechanisms, mediated by either innate or adaptive immune responses. The RIG-I pathway is an immune sensor of CCHFV RNA. Studies in human patients have shown that TLRs, in particular TLR 7, 8, 9 and 10 polymorphisms correlate with the severity and outcome of the disease in some geographical areas (Turkey) (Hawman and Feldmann 2018). The virus itself is able to antagonize innate immune signaling through deubiquitinatin and cleavage of proteins involved in innate immunity, such as ISG15, mediated by a specific domain (OTU, ovarian tumor-like deubiquinase domain) in the L segment of CCHFV. With regard to the role of the adaptive immunity responses to CCHFV in human pathogenesis, it is not completely clear, due to the lack of suitable model in vivo. The evidence obtained from the recently developed cynomologus animal model suggested that neither the antibodies titer nor their neutralizing activity seem to correlate to the outcome of CCHFV infection. The role of T cell responses, such as cytolitic activity in hepatic injury and severity of the CCHFV associated haemorragic disease, seems not necessary but needs further studies.",

Genotypes HEV\u20101 and HEV\u20102 are restricted to humans and circulate in endemic area (Asia and Africa) causing outbreaks following the ingestion of contaminated water. In non-endemic areas (industrialized countries), HEV\u20101 and HEV\u20102 are linked to travel in endemic areas. In the last 10 years, an increasing number of autochthonous infections, linked to the zoonotic transmission of the genotypes HEV\u20103 and HEV\u20104, have been described (Kamar et al. 2017). There are evidences for the presence of autochthonous cases of HEV infections in Italy since 1980 (Stroffolini et al. 2015). The virus is transmitted via oral-fecal route, as well as by zoonotic transmission through direct contact with infected animals or food. Swine is the principal reservoir of HEV, mainly belonging to genotypes 3 and 4, with prevalence of anti HEV antibodies ranging from 8% to 93% (Huang et al. 2019). Other reservoirs are wild board, rabbits, deer, mongooses, yaks and camels, infected with different genotypes (Nan and Zhang 2016). Vertical transmission from mother to fetuses (Sharma et al. 2017), and bloodborne transmission of the virus has been reported (Al-Sadeq, Majdalawieh and Nasrallah 2017).",

Anti-HEV IgG increase during the convalescent phase but it is not clear how long they persist. HEV RNA can be detected in stool about 1 week before the onset of illness and persists up to 2 weeks thereafter; serum viral RNA can persist up to 4 weeks in those who resolve the acute infection and for years in patients who develop chronic infection. The serological assays are easy to perform and relatively low expensive and several commercial and in-house ELISA assays are available; however, due to the cross-reactivity with other viruses and to the genotype variability of HEV, the sensitivity and specificity as well as performance of the serological tests are low and poor, providing inconclusive results. This is even more complicated in the case of immunosuppressed patients due to their delayed seroconversion upon HEV infection. The detection of HEV RNA by PCR and RT-PCR is therefore needed to confirm serological screening in persistent infection, especially in blood and organ donations (Al-Sadeq et al.2018).",

The majority were epidemiological (24) and cross-sectional (15) studies from Africa (Uganda, Nigeria, Madagascar, Ghana and Burkina Faso), Asia (India, China, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand), Europe (Italy, Germany, Portugal, Norway, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Netherlands), Brazil and Cuba. Three were retrospective studies (from Switzerland, Italy and Spain), two case studies (Australia and Spain) and one case-control study (China). In occupational settings zoonotic transmission of HEV implies direct contact with swine, principal reservoir of HEV or other animals (wild boar, deer). Indirect contact in areas where animals live and roam or with objects or surfaces contaminated with HEV stools is also considered a transmission route, as well as contact with pig and slaughterhouse sewage. Articles selected in the review comprised mainly swine workers, including farmers and slaughterers, and veterinarians as occupational categories at risk of exposure to HEV; to a lesser extent food handlers (Appuhamy et al. 2014; Cui et al. 2016), workers exposed to wastewater (Tschopp et al. 2009; Albatanony and El-Shafie 2011; Martins et al. 2014) and forestry workers (Carpentier et al. 2012; Dremsek et al. 2012). Seroprevalence data for anti HEV IgG ranged between 2.3% for a group of abattoir workers in Sardinia (Masia et al. 2009) and 2.4% among farmers in UK (Meader et al. 2010) and 68.5% among pig farmers in Germany (Krumbholz et al. 2014) and 76% among butchers in Burkina Faso (Traor\u00e9 et al. 2015). Significant risk factors for anti-HEV IgG positivity were age, amount of years of occupational exposure and direct swine contact. Hunting has been considered a possible risk factor for acquiring HEV infection, as reported in a study conducted in 144 hunters from Estonia that revealed the presence of HEV-specific IgG in 4.2% of the samples (Ivanova et al. 2015). Others found an anti-HEV prevalence significantly higher in Okinawa wild boar hunters (25.3%) than in the residents (male 7.7% and female 4.1%) (P < 0.0001) (Toyoda et al. 2008). However, the retrieved studies were not included in this review because we did not consider hunters as an occupational category.",

The virus is able to amplify or replicate to high titre within birds, usually wetlands birds, which in turn transmit the infection to mosquitoes, primarily belonging to the Culex genus. Mosquitoes can reinfect birds, perpetuating enzootic infection, or can bridge the infection to mammals, humans and horses principally, representing a public health concern (Ahlers and Goodman 2018). Pointing out environmental conditions that favor WNV circulation and transmission to humans is quite difficult, mainly due to the complexity of its biological cycle. Factors contributing to the current epidemiological picture, characterized by an increasing rate of spread in Europe and neighboring countries, are several and include urbanization, variation in land use and climate changes (Marcantonio et al. 2015). Temporal extension of transmission season may increase the risk of exposure to the infection. In fact, in 2018, early WNV transmission has been observed in Italy and in other countries in South and South Eastern Europe, with a high number of cases (Riccardo et al. 2018). Moreover, changes in daily work activities caused by increased heat, as longer rest periods in the middle of the day and augmented work at dawn and dusk, could correspond to period when vectors are most active, therefore increasing the risk of disease transmission (Vonesch et al. 2016). Outdoor workers, such as farmers and agricultural workers, may be at increased risk of WNV infection.",

They comprise laboratory diagnosticians, researchers and technicians, veterinarians, wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife biologists, ornithologists, zoo and aviary curators, healthcare workers, emergency response and public safety personnel (NIOSH 2003. Few studies on the occupational risk caused by WNV have been performed; in fact, we identified only ten articles eligible for inclusion. The four case reports we included in the review concerned one US security guard who attended an off-site work event (Smith 2016), one Brazilian ranch worker (Vieira et al. 2015), one veterinarian and one laboratorist, both in South Africa, (Venter et al. 2009; Venter and Swanepoel 2010), all affected by the neuroinvasive illness that required hospitalization. In the first two cases, mosquito bites were responsible for the transmission of the virus; the veterinarian and the laboratorist acquired infection by needle stick injuries. The seroprevalence/seroepidemiological studies included in the study showed very low positivity for anti-WNV IgG in Italy and Spain, from 0% (Spataro et al. 2008; Remoli et al. 2018) to 2.8% (Bernabeu-Wittel et al. 2007), mainly regarding farmers, agricultural workers, veterinarians and foresters. Higher levels were reported in South Africa (7.9% for veterinarians) (van Eeden, Swanepoel and Venter 2014) and Turkey (20.87% for farmers and agricultural workers). In South Africa the virus is an endemic zoonotic agent and occurs where the principal vector (Culex univittatus) and avian host are present (van Eeden, Swanepoel and Venter 2014).",

WNV outbreak in animals precede human cases; therefore, an active surveillance system to detect cases in birds and horses is essential to provide early warning for veterinary and human health authorities. In Italy entomological, veterinary and human surveillance systems for WNV infection have been implemented starting from 1998, when the disease was first detected in horses in Tuscany region. Starting from 2008, human cases have been reported in North-eastern Italy, an area now considered endemic for the virus: this is not unexpected since the geographical position of the country favors the distribution of arthropods as possible vectors of human pathogens. The few numbers of studies conducted in Italian workers could be explained by the difficulty in recruiting workers at risk of exposure to the infection, since they are mainly seasonal, often foreigners and cultural and language barriers could limit their participation to the studies (Remoli et al. 2018). Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues. Physicians should be alerted to detect clinical cases and educational programs raising awareness about the disease and the risk factors should be implemented. Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed WNV infection or handling their specimens, should implement standard infection control precautions; laboratorists should use effective personal protective equipment and apply biosafety measures (WHO 2017). Vaccines are not yet available for humans; treatment is supportive for patients with neuroinvasive disease (WHO 2017). It should be taken into account that although most WNV infections are subclinical, assessing the occupational risk is important not only for protecting workers\u2019 health, but also for providing information on the potential spread of the virus.",

Weather conditions may influence the timing of activation and densities of ticks, being ectothermic organisms. Migrating birds are sources of blood-meals for immature ticks, contributing to the dispersal of infected vectors and potential emergence of disease foci. Long-distance movement of livestock may also contribute to dispersal of CCHFV-infected ticks (Al-Abri SS et al. 2017; Gargili et al 2017). In endemic areas, farmers, veterinarians, livestock market workers, abattoir workers and other personnel engaged in activities in contact with animals and/or animal products are considered at risk for acquiring CCHFV infection, as well outdoor workers who could be exposed to infected ticks. Healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to the virus, when nursing infected patients with severe bleeding and hemorrhages without strict barrier procedures. Nosocomial transmission may therefore occur through direct contact with infected blood or body fluids, or through contaminated medical equipment or supply (ECDC 2015). Case reports attesting CCHFV transmission through direct contact with infected blood or tissue of animals regarded mainly farmers (Yadav et al. 2017) and livestock workers (Mardani et al. 2009; Mardani, Namazee 2013). Traditional slaughtering and butchery performed in some country (Iran) can be considered activities at risk (Fazlalipour et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Most articles sharing this transmission pathway are seroprevalence studies, carried out in Africa, Asia and Europe, and mainly regarding farmers, slaughterers, butchers and veterinarians (Gunes et al. 2009; Sidira et al. 2013; Akuffo et al. 2016; Cikman et al. 2016; Wasfi et al. 2016; Mostafavi et al. 2017; Vawda et al. 2018). The low seroprevalence for anti-CCHFV IgG antibodies (0.51%) found in South Africa among workers exposed to or in contact with animals seems to suggest that the virus is uncommon in this area (Vawda et al. 2018). The higher seroprevalence detected in Iran (16.49% among butchers and slaughterhouse workers) could be caused by the minimal use of personal PPE during daily work, as admitted by workers who completed a questionnaire (Mostafavi et al. 2017). A statistically significant difference between prevalence of CCHFV IgG antibodies in livestock workers and unexposed subjects was found in Turkey. CCHFV is endemic in central and north-eastern Anatolia and southern Black Sea regions of this country and several cases are emerging in other zones (Cikman et al. 2016). A cross sectional study conducted in Greece (Sargianou et al. 2013) showed that an agro-pastoral occupation, contact with sheep and goats, tick bites and increasing age were significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity. Another cross sectional study performed in Madagascar (Andriamandimby et al. 2011) showed that here the percentage of CCHF infection is very low among at risk professionals because of the lack of ticks of the genera Hyalomma in this country. Four retrospective studies were conducted in India (Mourya et al. 2017) and Turkey (Duran et al. 2013; Guner et al. 2014; Leblebicioglu et al. 2016) on patients with a history of occupational exposure, suspected to have CCHFV infection, through a retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data. In endemic areas, hemorrhagic manifestations including melena, low platelet count and raised alanine aminotransferase may provide a suspicion of CCHFV infection. In Turkey, people living and actively working in rural areas (including housewives occupied in agriculture and animal husbandry) are particularly subjected to the infection. It was observed that public awareness about CCHFV has decreased the incidence of the disease (Duran et al. 2013). Nosocomial transmission of CCHFV to HCWs has been reported from different countries. The evidence that HCWs are at risk of exposure to CCHFV while caring infected patients is also supported by most case reports selected for the review (Mardani et al. 2009; Naderi et al. 2011; Celikbas et al. 2014; Ozsoy et al. 2015; Pshenichnaya and Nenadskaya 2015; Yadav et al. 2016; Yildirmak, Tulek and Bulut 2016; Negredo et al. 2017). In the differential diagnosis of subjects with hemorrhagic signs, physicians should consider CCHFV infection if these patients have recently returned from any area where the virus is endemic or prevalent. Of interest the concern regarding transmission of CCHFV via respiratory contact, as supposed by a case report from Russia (Pshenichnaya and Nenadskaya 2015) and one from Turkey (Yildirmak, Tulek and Bulut 2016), suggesting that airborne precautions could be essential during aerosol generating procedures. High mortality rate has been attested during nosocomial outbreaks; in some cases, ribavirin has been considered an effective treatment for the infection and could be used for postexposure prophylaxis (Celikbas et al. 2014). In our review, we included seroprevalence studies regarding seropositive HCWs from Turkey (Gozel et al. 2013), Greece (Maltezou, Maltezos and Papa 2009) and Iran (Mardani et al. 2007). Needle-stick injury, interventions for gastrointestinal bleeding, unprotected handling of infected materials, and emergency surgical interventions have been reported as high-risk activities for viral transmission. Military personnel that travel to and work in environments where they could be exposed to endemic or emerging infections, that are not present or prevalent in their native country, can be considered at high risk of contracting CCHFV. We selected 3 articles regarding Afghan National Army recruits (Todd et al. 2016) UK military personnel deployed to Afghanistan (Newman et al. 2014), and military units from Saudi Arabian Provinces. In these groups, seroprevalences were 4.1%, 0% and 0.58%, respectively. CCHFV infection has important public health implication due to the potential of human-to-human transmission; therefore, enhanced surveillance for tick vectors and CCHFV cases is essential. Control and prevention of the infection in ticks and animal is quite difficult since the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in animals is usually not apparent. Educational and training programs addressed to workers with potential exposure to the virus aiming at increasing their knowledge, attitude and practice should be developed and implemented as preventive measures. Moreover, the use of approved acaricides on clothing and tick repellent on exposed skin and clothing, and wearing protective clothing are suggested for reducing the risk of tick to human transmission. Wearing gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in areas where CCHFV is endemic could minimize the risk of animal to human transmission (WHO 2013; ECDC 2015). In healthcare settings, implementation of standard infection control precautions by healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHFV infection or handling their specimens, should be recommended.",

Seroprevalence results were higher in individuals exposed to swine and/or wild animals, and increased with age and amount of years of occupational exposure. Humans with occupational exposure to wild animals and environmental sources of domestic animal wastes or with unexplained hepatitis showed an increased seroprevalence of anti-HEV antibodies. Poor environmental conditions in farms, occupation and low socioeconomic status might be risk factors in HEV infection. Wild boar stools may be responsible for a further source of HEV infection for people in close contact with the forestry environment. Forestry workers have already been identified to be at risk for HEV infection, as well as woodcutters. The finding of HEV and HEV-related RNA in a rising number of different animal species suggests a possible role for unidentified animal reservoirs, up to now as risk factors associated with HEV seropositivity in humans in areas where HEV is not endemic. Such reservoirs should be further explored by means of suitable diagnostic tools (Carpentier et al. 2012).",

Moreover, variations in seropositivity rates reported in studies from around the world, could be ascribed by the use of immunological assays with different sensitivity (Meader et al. 2010).

Standard biosecurity measures, including regular cleaning and disinfection, should be put in place to limit contamination of swine facilities. A vaccine against HEV, licensed in China in 2011, prevent symptomatic HEV-4 infections, but does not provide sterilising immunity. The vaccine seems to be safe in pregnant women, but the long-term efficacy in immunosuppressed and in subjects with chronic liver disease has to be determined. An important role of the vaccine could be the prevention of HEV outbreaks, e.g. in African refugee camps or other emergency settings (EASL 2018). In the absence of an effective vaccine against HEV, prevention for swine workers, farmers, butchers and veterinarians relies on the implementation of hygiene and individual protection. Raising awareness and improved education about the risk of acquiring HEV and the appropriate precautions may help to prevent the infection.",
