Viral genome integration into the host genome is a hallmark of retroviruses, as it is a mandatory step in the retroviral life cycle and a prerequisite for productive infection. Upon integration, the retrovirus will persist in the infected cell for its entire lifespan, and will affect host gene expression depending on the integration site. Furthermore, if retroviral infection and integration occurs in the germline, the provirus will be transmitted to the progeny, and will thus contribute shaping the genome of future generations. This is the case of the so called \"endogenized\" retroviruses or endogenous retroviruses (ERV).",

            "text": "After completion of reverse transcription, the linear double-stranded cDNA fl anked by the long terminal repeats (LTR) is part of a nucleoprotein complex called preintegration complex (PIC). The PIC contains multiple viral and cellular proteinsincluding in the case of HIV-1: viral integrase (IN), matrix (MA), Vpr, and cellular barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), high-mobility group chromosomal protein A1 (HMGA1), integrase interactor 1 (Ini1), lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) -that may contribute to nuclear translocation, integration of the viral genome, and subsequent immediate transcription, and which composition may vary along the way to the host genome (Belshan et al. 2009 ; Farnet and Haseltine 1991 ; Fassati and Goff 2001 ; Lin and Engelman 2003 ; Miller et al. 1997 ; Raghavendra et al. 2010 ) . To cross the nuclear membrane and reach the nucleus, retroviruses have evolved different strategies. Simple retroviruses (alpharetroviruses, betaretroviruses, gammaretroviruses and epsilonretroviruses) are able to reach the nucleus only upon nuclear membrane disruption occurring at the time of mitosis, providing a coherent explanation on why these retroviruses infect dividing cells but are unable to infect non-dividing cells (Lewis and Emerman 1994 ; Roe et al. 1993 ) . In contrast, spumaviruses and lentiviruses have the capacity to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, entering the nucleus through an active, yet poorly elucidated, mechanism (Suzuki and Craigie 2007 ) . The current model for HIV-1 proposes that a PIC containing minimally the viral integrase and the viral cDNA crosses the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a superstructure mediating the transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, via speci fi c interactions with NPC proteins, including importin a 3, importin 7, NUP153*, RANBP2* and * NUP153: nucleoporin 153 * RANBP2: RAN binding protein 2 Transportin-SR2/TNPO3 (Ao et al. 2010 ; Christ et al. 2008 ; Levin et al. 2010 ; Ocwieja et al. 2011 ; Woodward et al. 2009 ) . Retroviral genome integration occurs in three steps, the fi rst two being catalyzed by the retroviral integrase (IN) protein (Fig. 1b , the example of HIV-1) . IN is bound to the LTR and requires approximately the 32 terminal nucleotides (Bera et al. 2009 ) . First, when the PIC is still in the cytoplasm (Miller et al. 1997 ) , IN hydrolyzes a dinucleotide at each 3 \u00a2 end, a process called 3 \u00a2 processing. Second, IN catalyzes the strand transfer reaction, consisting in simultaneously breaking the host DNA asymmetrically and joining it to the recessed viral DNA 3 \u00a2 -OH ends. The IN-mediated asymmetric DNA breaks in the host genome are determined by the retroviral protein structure and vary between 4 and 6 nucleotides (5 in the case of HIV-1). Finally, to stabilize the proviral insertion, the host DNA repair machinery -involving the DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) comprising a DNA-PK catalytic subunit and a DNA binding Ku80/Ku70 complex, and the ligase IV/XRRC4 complex of the non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) -cleaves the viral protruding 5 \u00a2 nucleotides and fi lls in the 4-6 bp gap, resulting in the duplication of the gap nucleotide sequence surrounding the provirus.",

The C-terminal domain (residues 212-288 in HIV-1 IN) is also involved in DNA binding and IN multimerization. And most importantly, the catalytic core domain (residues 50-212 in HIV-1 IN), carrying a typical signature with the D,D(35) E acidic triad in the active site, is essential for metal (Mg2+) binding and IN enzymatic activity, and is involved in viral DNA binding as well as host cellular target DNA binding.

However, the use of longer DNA substrates mixed with IN allowed to reconstitute concerted full-site integration (integration of both LTR ends) (Sinha and Grandgenett 2005 ; Sinha et al. 2002 ) , thereby mimicking the in vivo situation more faithfully and suggesting that other genomic regions in addition to LTR extremities contribute to integration ef fi ciency (Li and Craigie 2005 ) .

Since then and thanks to the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies and the availability of the genomic sequence of multiple species, a more complete picture of retroviral integration preferences emerged ( All retroviruses do not display the same integration site preferences. Indeed gammaretroviruses, spumaretroviruses and endogenous retroviruses favor promoters and transcription start sites of active genes, characterized by high CpG islands and DNaseI hypersensitive sites (Mitchell et al. 2004 ; Wu et al. 2003 ; Trobridge et al. 2006 ; Brady et al. 2009 ; Kim et al. 2008 Kim et al. , 2011 . Integration of alpharetroviruses and deltaretrovirues is also, although weakly, favored in transcription units and CpG islands (Derse et al. 2007 ; Mitchell et al. 2004 ) . In contrast, lentiviruses prefer integrating in active genes, along the transcription unit, in both introns and exons, and are often associated with epigenetic marks characterizing active transcription, including H3Ac, H4Ac, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, while disfavoring epigenetic marks associated with repressed transcription such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K79me3, H4K20me3 and DNA methylation Derse et al. 2007 ; Mitchell et al. 2004 ; Roth et al. 2011 ; Schroder et al. 2002 ; Wang et al. 2007 Wang et al. , 2009 ) . Finally, the MMTV betaretrovirus is the only one considered to integrate randomly, with no statistically signi fi cant preference for chromosomal features (Faschinger et al. 2008 ) , nevertheless some common integration sites near cellular oncogenes belonging to Wnt and Fgf families have been reported Smith 2000, 2008 ) .",

Indeed, HIV-1 vector containing MLV Gag only displayed speci fi c integration preferences that differed from both HIV-1 and MLV and suggesting that Gag may play a role in integration site selection. In contrast, HIV-1 vector containing MLV IN lost integration preferences for transcription units and acquired preferences for transcription start sites close to MLV phenotype, suggesting that HIV-1 IN is the major determinant for HIV-1 integration site selection.

Indeed, cells depleted for LEDGF/p75 do not favor transcription units anymore but rather CpG islands Marshall et al. 2007 ; Schrijvers et al. 2012 ; Shun et al. 2007 ) . LEDGF/p75 is required for ef fi cient integration and site selection, not only for HIV-1, but for many lentiviruses (SIV, EIAV) (Busschots et al. 2007 ; Cherepanov 2007 ; Marshall et al. 2007 ) . In contrast, integration site selection of other retroviruses, such as MLV (a gammaretrovirus), is not affected by LEDGF/p75 depletion, providing additional evidence that LEDGF/p75 is the major tethering factor for lentiviruses only. Of note, Schrijvers et al. recently demonstrated that, in absence of LEDGF/p75, hepatomaderived growth factor related protein 2 (HRP2) was acting as an alternative tethering protein for HIV-1 PIC, although less ef fi cient than LEDGF/p75 (Schrijvers et al. 2012 ) . Except for Foamy virus (FV), for which H2A/H2B heterodimers were shown to interact with FV Gag, thus tethering FV PIC to chromatin (Tobaly-Tapiero et al. 2008 ) , speci fi c tethering proteins for other retroviral genera remains to be identi fi ed.",

Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses containing a bisegmented negative single stranded RNA genome coding for four viral proteins: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the nucleocapsid, the glycoprotein and a RING-domain containing protein. The replication of arenaviruses is completely different from retroviruses, with a broader cell tropism (Emonet et al. 2011 ) . Viral replication takes place exclusively in the cytoplasm in which RNA synthesis is performed by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Although RdRps belong to the reverse transcriptase-like superfamily, no reverse transcriptase activity has been detected so far. Therefore, these viruses normally do not integrate into the host chromosomes. However, studies aiming at characterizing LCMV persistence in infected mice were able to detect LCMV DNA sequences by PCR in ~60% of mice 200 days post-infection (long after LCMV blood clearance), at a frequency of about 1 LCMV DNA copy in 10 4 -10 5 splenocytes (Klenerman et al. 1997 ) . LCMV DNA was also detected in murine and hamster cell lines (which are considered as the natural hosts for LCMV), but not in non-natural host cell lines (human, monkey, dog, cow). Further analysis highlighted a role for retrotransposons*, encoding a reverse transcriptase (RT), in the generation of LCMV DNA and subsequent integration. Interestingly, murine and hamster cells display a high level of endogenous RT activity, consistent, in part, with the natural host restriction observed. Recently, Geuking et al. showed that RT from endogenous retrotransposons can illegitimately recombine with the exogenous LCMV RNA genome by template switching, providing additional data pointing towards the role of retrotransposons in reverse transcribing and integrating LCMV genomic sequences (Geuking et al. 2009 ) .",

Similarly to arenaviruses, neither reverse transcriptase activity, nor integration activity have been reported for these viruses. However, sequences of the capsid and the RdRp genes have been identi fi ed in many eukaryotic genomes, suggesting that integration of these viral sequences can occur more frequently as initially expected (Liu et al. 2010 ) . Based on these observations, the question remains: how can these viral sequences integrate in the host genome? Liu and coworkers proposed two models (Liu et al. 2010 ): (i) an illegitimate and incidental recombination with retrotransposons may occur, leading to the integration of viral sequences, as described for LCMV (Geuking et al. 2009 ; Tanne and Sela 2005 ) or (ii) the double-strand-break repair machinery of the host cell may capture nearby viral DNA sequences and insert them in some instable regions of the genome, as described in yeast (Frank and Wolfe 2009 ; Puchta 2005 ) . Although both models can each contribute, only the fi rst model enacting a role for retrotransposons can explain the prior appearance of a viral DNA intermediate, essential for being considered as a substrate of host genome insertion. * Retrotransposons are mobile genetic DNA elements that resemble retroviruses, with reverse transcription and integrase activities but devoid of the extracellular part of the life cycle.",

            "text": "The adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a widespread virus classi fi ed among the parvoviridae family. The relationship between AAV and the host remains obscure due partially to the absence of associated pathology. Replication of AAV is strictly conditioned by the presence in the same infected cell of helper viruses such as adenoviruses (Ad), human papillomaviruses (HPV) or herpes simplex viruses (HSV). In absence of helper viruses, AAV integrates its genome in a site-speci fi c way. The molecular mechanism involved in AAV integration has only been investigated for the type 2 serotype (AAV-2). The genome organization of AAV-2 consists of two major open reading frames coding for the non-structural proteins Rep (Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40) and structural proteins Cap (VP1, VP2 and VP3), fl anked by inverted terminal repeats (ITR). The site-speci fi c integration of AAV-2 is located in a non-repetitive element at the position 19q13,42 corresponding to the long arm of the chromosome 19, in a gene-dense region named AAVS1 (for AAV integration site 1) (Fig. 3a ) (Kotin et al. 1991 ) . Analysis of AAVS1 host sequence revealed two cis-acting sequences involved in AAV-2 integration: the terminal resolution site (TRS) corresponding to the Rep-speci fi c endonuclease site and the Rep binding site (RBS) (Brister and Muzyczka 1999 ; McCarty et al. 1994a, b ) . Interestingly, this TRS-RBS motif is also present in the ITR of the viral genome, suggesting that the sequence homo logy between AAV-2 ITR and the host genome site -TRS and RBS sequences -plays a role in AAV-2 integration. Recently, two new AAV-2 integration sites have been reported in chromosomes 5 (5p13.3) and 3 (3p24.3), named AAVS2 and AAVS3 respectively, that also carry a RBS motif ( H\u00fcser et al. 2010 ) .",

EBV is associated with several proliferative disorders and cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Epstein et al. 1964 ; Gutensohn and Cole 1980 ; Zur Hausen and Schulte-Holthausen 1970 ) . Two stages of EBV infection exist: (i) the lytic or productive cycle, in which the infected cell is actively releasing new infectious viral particles, and (ii) the latent cycle, in which only a few viral proteins are expressed, some of which are directly linked with cell proliferation and thus cancer. During latent infection, the EBV genome persists as an episome. However, the presence of linearized EBV genome in the host genome has been identi fi ed and con fi rmed using different approaches, including cytological hybridization, FISH*, PCR*, genomic library screening and sequencing. The presence of integrated EBV genome suggests an alternative way for EBV to establish long term infection (Gao et al. 2006 ; Hurley et al. 1991 ; Lestou et al. 1993 ) . However, the question whether integration site selection occurs randomly or not is still a matter of debate, mainly due to the technical dif fi culties to isolate EBV integration events from EBV episomes (Gao et al. 2006 ; Takakuwa et al. 2004 ) . Nevertheless, data so far suggest that EBV integration is not random and occurs preferentially in regions corresponding to heterochromatin (Gao et al. 2006 ; Lestou et al. 1993 ) (Fig. 3a ) . However, EBV integration has also been identi fi ed in genes, including MACF1 *, BACH-2 * (putative tumor suppressor gene), REL * and BCL-11A * (proto-oncogenes), thereby revealing a potential impact of EBV integration in disrupting the expression of some cellular genes (Takakuwa et al. 2004 ) .",

This chromatin attachment process could be enlarged to other family members, including the Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV). Indeed, it was shown that KSHV episomal genome was attached to the host chromatin via the cellular histones 2A and 2B, the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and the LANA (latency associated nuclear antigen) viral protein (Fig. 3b ) (Barbera et al. 2006 ; Matsumura et al. 2010 ; Verma and Robertson 2003 ) . Although the mechanisms involved in EBV and KHSV genome integration into the host chromatin remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to hypothesize, based on the retroviral tethering model, that viral DNA episome integration requires initially these docking proteins (EBNA-1 complex, LANA complex), thereby creating an opportunity for the subsequent incidental recombination and insertion into the host DNA, probably mediated by the cellular DNA repair machinery.",

            "text": "Adenoviruses are double stranded DNA viruses, usually perceived as non-integrating viruses with a genome persisting under episomal form. However, in hamster cells, the complete genome of Ad12 was found to be stably integrated into the host chromosomes, with a few nucleotide modi fi cations at the viral junctions. Similarly, Stephen et al. infected hamster immortalized (HT-1080 and C32) and primary fi broblasts (FF-92) with an Ad5-derived vector and identi fi ed 59 integration sites: 29 were found in active transcription units in all chromosomes and 15 out of the 30 integration sites identi fi ed outside genes were located near genes, suggesting preferential integration of Ad in gene loci (Fig. 3a ) (Stephen et al. 2008 (Stephen et al. , 2010 ) . The current model suggests that Ad ITR contains speci fi c symmetric recombinant (SYREC) sequences, which have stretches homologous to cellular repetitive elements, and that could thus allow Ad host genome insertion through patchy nucleotide homology (Fig. 3b ) (Deuring and Doer fl er 1983 ; Deuring et al. 1981 ; Doer fl er 2009 ; Stabel and Doer fl er 1982 ; Wronka et al. 2002 ) . Further analysis of Ad integration events in vitro and in vivo revealed that both homologous recombination and heterologous recombination (non homologous end joining pathway) were involved in this SYREC-mediated integration process (Hoglund et al. 1992 ; Stephen et al. 2008 Stephen et al. , 2010  * hTERT human telomerase reverse transcriptase * PDGF receptor platelet-derived growth factor receptor Wronka et al. 2002 ) . Adenovirus-based vectors are currently the most used vectors in gene therapy, representing 24.2% of the clinical trials (source http://www. wiley.com//legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical ). Understanding the frequency and the mechanisms of Ad integration and recombination should help render these vectors safer for gene therapy trials.",

Upon viral invasion, the presence of a linear double-stranded DNA is sensed by the host DNA repair machinery as a DNA break, which will lead to cell apoptosis unless successfully repaired (Daniel et al. 1999 ; O'Brien 1998 ) . Following the same concept, if the cell is invaded by multiple viral particles, thus multiple DNA genomes, it is likely that the DNA repair machinery will be overwhelmed, and will thus fail in repairing all the DNA molecules, thereby resulting in cell death. Similarly, if too many viral genomes integrate successfully, the integrity of the host genome itself may be compromised, also leading to cell death. In addition, viral integration will eventually lead to gene expression deregulation that may induce cell apoptosis. For instance, it has been reported that integration of HBV in ATP2A1/ SERCA-1* gene resulted in gene disruption and in the expression of a chimeric non functional protein HBVx/SERCA-1 (Fig. 4 ) . This chimeric protein lost calcium and ATP binding domains, thereby strongly disturbing the reticulum endoplasmic calcium homeostasis and inducing apoptosis (Chami et al. 2000 ) .",

In this case, tumorigenesis is a slow process directly related to the viral integration site, which disturbs the cell homeostasis. Indeed, viral integration alters and modulates the expression of cellular nearby genes (Fig. 4 ) . A fi rst scenario is the result of gene disruption by the viral integration event. If the disrupted gene is a tumor suppressor gene for example, this may ultimately lead to cellular transformation. Second, viral integration occurring close to cellular oncogenes may result in viral promoter-induced overexpression of the oncogene. The best illustration of this event occurred in a gene therapy trial aiming at correcting the severe combined immunode fi ciency-X1 disease (SCID-X1) using a gammaretroviral vector providing a functional IL2RG * gene (Cavazzana-Calvo et al. 2000 ) . Although this trial was successful, restoring an immune function, 4 out of 9 patients developed leukemia in the 5 years following viral transduction (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008 ) . The analysis of viral integration sites in the transduced cells identi fi ed integration events nearby the LMO2* proto-oncogene, yielding to LMO2 overexpression (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008 ) . The aberrant expression of LMO2 is a major determinant of T cell immortalization as recently demonstrated in vitro after gammaretroviral transduction of the proto-oncogene LMO2 in T cells (Newrzela et al. 2011 ) . Although it was shown that MLV vectors preferentially integrate at promoters and regions close to the transcription start site (Kim et al. 2008 (Kim et al. , 2011 Mitchell et al. 2004 ; Wu et al. 2003 ) , exon 1 of LMO2 locus was shown to be a hotspot for MLV integration in T cells, with 1 integration out of 2.125 \u00b4 10 5 (Yamada et al. 2009 ) . Nonetheless, new MLV-derived vectors containing chromatin insulator elements from the chicken b -globin have been engineered to block the viral enhancer activity of the promoter, thereby reducing the risk of MLV-induced leukemia (Emery 2011 ) .",

Although the mechanisms underlying virus reactivation, allowing the virus to exit a transcriptionally silent and latent state in favor of a productive state releasing infectious particles, is not yet completely understood, it is nevertheless obvious that this can only be achieved thanks to the presence of the integrated HIV-1 genome in the infected cell (Joos et al. 2008 ; Zhang et al. 2000 ) .

In the case of HIV-1, three major players are currently involved in latency: (i) the availability of cellular transcription factors. Indeed, a current model implies that HIV-1 is transcriptionally active in activated infected T cells, and that when the T cells evolve to a resting memory state, many transcription factors become unavailable, thus silencing viral transcription (Coiras et al. 2009 ) . Furthermore, epigenetic modi fi cations implicating de novo methylation of the provirus and chromatin remodeling complexes may also contribute to the transcriptional silencing of the integrated retrovirus (Agbottah et al. 2006 ; Blazkova et al. 2009 ; Kauder et al. 2009 ; Mahmoudi et al. 2006 ; Treand et al. 2006 ) . (ii) The level of the viral transactivator protein, Tat, which is responsible for ef fi cient viral transcription, and (iii) the site of viral integration. Indeed, it has been shown that infected cells in a latent state were characterized with proviruses in heterochromatin and centromeric regions (Jordan et al. 2003 ; ) and were found more often in sense orientation, leading to decreased viral transcription due to RNA interference (Shan et al. 2011 ) .",
