COVID-19 is a pandemic (cases confirmed in more than 140 territories) with an estimated death rate between 1% and 5% (Roser & Ritchie, 2020); and an estimated R0 between 2.2 and 6.7 (Liu, Gayle, Wilder-Smith, & Rockl\u00f6v, 2020; Sanche et al., 2020). As of March 28th, 2020, there were over 649,000 confirmed cases and 115,500 total deaths, globally. In the United States (U.S.), there were over 115,000 cases and 1891 deaths (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). Approximately 80% of confirmed cases are mild, with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Ruan, Yang, Wang, Jiang, & Song, 2020). Severe cases may experience pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death (Mahase, 2020). The vast majority of deaths from COVID-19 are those with preexisting conditions (e.g. hypertension and heart disease), are immunocompromised, or above 60 years old (Wu & McGoogan, 2020).",

One such method is the space-time scan statistic (Kulldorff, 1997), which is widely used to identify significant clusters of disease. Space-time scan statistics supplement and can study basic rate maps of disease by relying on a variety of data models to determine whether the observed space-time patterns of a disease are due to chance or randomly distributed. In other words, scan statistics detect clusters that are outliers (e.g. unexpected clustering given baseline conditions). The statistic utilizes circles or ellipses (scanning window) that are centered on grid points and move (scan) systematically across a study area to identify clusters of cases (each window counts number of aggregated cases per geographic unit). In its space-extension, the location, size, and duration of statistically significant clusters of disease cases are subsequently reported (Desjardins et al. 2018; Owusu, Desjardins, Baker, & Delmelle, 2019; Whiteman, Desjardins, Eskildsen, & Loaiza, 2019; Desjardins, Hohl, Delmelle, & Casas, 2020).",

The statistic will detect clusters that are \u201cactive\u201d at the end of the study period; but as more data (e.g. confirmed cases) becomes available, the statistic can be rerun to confirm the presence and track the clusters in space and time, update relative risks for each location affected by a disease, and detect new emerging clusters. The main purpose of using a prospective statistic rather than retrospective is to only focus on significant clustering that is \u201cactive\u201d or present at the time of the analysis; which disregards clusters that may have existed previously, and are no longer a public health threat (Kulldorff, 2001). For example, the prospective space-time scan statistic has been utilized to detect emerging clusters of shigellosis (Jones, Liberatore, Fernandez, & Gerber, 2006), measles (Yin, Li, Ma, & Feng, 2007), thyroid cancer (Kulldorff, 2001), and syndromic surveillance (Yih et al., 2010). Since COVID-19 data are updated daily, our approach can contribute to timely monitoring of the pandemic, focusing on the United States in this study.",

Since COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that can affect all segments of the population, we decided not to adjust for age.

The cylinder has an elevated risk when the likelihood ratio is greater than 1, that is nZ\u03bc(Z)>N\u2212nZN\u2212\u03bc(Z) . Furthermore, the space-time scan statistic uses different cylinder sizes, and the cylinder with the highest likelihood ratio (maximum) is the most likely cluster. Monte Carlo testing is utilized (999 simulations) to assess the statistical significance of space-time clusters. Each simulation is conditioned to the same number of cases, and the likelihood is computed, so we obtain 999 likelihood ratios for each candidate cluster representing the distribution of the likelihood ratio under H0. Secondary clusters are also reported if they are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.",

Westchester County includes the city of New Rochelle, which was the location of New York's initial outbreak and was subject to a containment zone spanning a one-mile radius (Wallis, 2020).

We demonstrate the notion of the prospective approach by presenting results between January 22nd \u2013 March 9th, 2020, and January 22nd \u2013 March 27th, 2020.

Enhanced hygiene and stricter social distancing measures are required to reduce SARS-CoV-2 circulation, especially when community transmission is detected (Dalton, Corbett, & Katelaris, 2020). Availability of public datasets are also critical to increase surveillance efforts across the globe and corresponding areas facing substantial increases in transmission (Sun, Chen, & Viboud, 2020). Confirmed case counts are not enough to understand the true magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "Despite the strengths of our study, there are limitations worth mentioning. First, there are many counties that were included in the clusters that did not contain any reported cases of COVID-19; however, this is due to the scanning process (an artifact of the statistic) and is circumvented by reporting the relative risk for the locations that belong to each cluster. Second, the case data only include confirmed cases and it is important to highlight that suspected and probable cases are not considered due to unavailability and uncertainty. Therefore, the true magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and will not be known for some time. Third, more local-level surveillance and studies are required to understand the transmission dynamics of the current and future emerging clusters; as SaTScan is an exploratory statistic. Fourth, COVID-19 is more severe for the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions. Future studies can implement case/control cluster techniques with death and case counts (e.g. space-time Bernoulli models), while simultaneously adjusting for age and other relevant covariates. It is also possible to adjust for younger age groups to examine if mitigation guidelines have been successful in any way. Finally, this study utilized COVID-19 case data up until March 27th, 2020. Therefore, the magnitude and number of emerging clusters in our county-level analysis is likely much higher as cases continue to increase across the U.S.",

We suggest that the counties belonging to emerging clusters should be prioritized when allocating resources and implementing various quarantine and isolation measures to slow viral transmission. COVID-19 and general infectious disease surveillance can benefit from our prospective approach by monitoring outbreaks as they happen as new data becomes available. We emphasize the importance of focusing surveillance on emerging and active clusters during epidemics, essentially dismissing previous clusters that do not threaten public health that would appear in a retrospective analysis. Furthermore, data sharing and availability is crucial and allows a variety of researchers to contribute to our knowledge of COVID-19 and epidemiology, in general. Geographers can play a vital role in mitigating disease transmission, and this study is one example of the plethora of methods that can be implemented in a limited timeframe to effectively inform public health officials and decision-makers about spatial and space-time transmission dynamics.",
