The exact mechanisms of sepsis and MOF are still an enigma, but it has been suggested that the gut is the \u201cmotor\u201d of such septic states [1] and the first step of a \u201cgut-liver-lung axis\u201d [2]. A number of factors have been shown to predispose to the passage of bacteria or bacteria products such as endotoxin from the lumen of the gut into the bloodstream (bacterial translocation). These include shock, parenteral nutrition, intestinal epithelial damage, and antibiotic therapy [3]. Translocation of bacteria and endotoxin may lead to activation of the immune inflammatory system and the production of cytokines and other immune inflammatory mediators that can promote systemic inflammatory response, multiple organ failure, and death [4].",

All of the above derangements, acting in concert, may ultimately lead to multiple organ failure and death [5]. The mechanisms by which sepsis damages intestinal mucosa are poorly understood. The innate immune recognition of bacterial and viral products is mediated by a family of transmembrane receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Since TLRs were initially found as mammalian homologues of the Drosophila membrane protein toll [6], ten mammalian homologues have been identified and are designated TLR1-10, respectively [7]. Several experimental studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall constituent of Gram-negative bacteria, is usually recognized by TLR4 receptor whereas TLR2 recognizes gram-positive bacterial cell wall components [8]. In enterocytes, exposure to LPS results in endothelial activation through a TLR4 receptor.",

            "text": "Extensive studies in various experimental models have established that insulin plays an important role in normal intestinal physiology [10, 11, 14\u201316]. A fact that insulin is present in human milk and that breast milk stimulates maturation and proliferation of intestinal mucosa, led to the hypothesis that insulin might have a trophic gut effect [9]. Shulman et al. [10] have demonstrated that administration of oral insulin causes an increase in ileal mass and disaccharidase activity in the newborn miniature pig without apparent concomitant changes in serum glucose, insulin, or cortisol levels. In another experiment, the same authors observed an increase in ileal lactase activity following oral insulin administration in the newborn miniature pig [11]. In a recent clinical trial, these authors has shown that enteral administration of insulin to preterm infants (26\u201329 weeks of gestational age) leads to a higher lactase activity and less feeding intolerance [14]. Buts et al. [15] analyzed the distribution, ontogeny, and molecular properties of insulin receptors in immature and mature enterocytes using radioligand binding assays. They have shown that 125I-insulin binding to the insulin receptor was five times higher in crypt cells than in villus cells and two times higher in the ileum than in the jejunum. These authors concluded that increased responsiveness of rat immature enterocytes to insulin could be related to high membrane concentrations of insulin receptor and that normal rat enterocytes express a 60-kDa phosphotyrosine protein identified as a direct substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In another study, these researchers have demonstrated that insulin activates the brush border membrane hydrolases in rat immature intestine by binding the hormone to its intestinal receptor and indirect triggering of the transcription of hydrolases genes and possibly by changes in intracellular polyamine concentrations [16]. We have recently shown that oral insulin supplementation exerts intestinal trophic effects, as well as systemic effects in rats when administered up to 6 weeks beyond the suckling period [17]. Since insulin has trophic gut effects, we hypothesized that insulin may have a beneficial effect on gut growth and recovery in different gastrointestinal disorders. We have recently demonstrated that oral insulin exerts a strong stimulating effect on bowel re-growth following massive small bowel resection in a rat [18]. In a different experiment, we have shown that oral insulin does not prevent ischemic damage but accelerates intestinal recovery, enhances enterocyte proliferation, and decreases cell death via apoptosis following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion in jury in rats [19].",

Decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis were the main mechanisms responsible for decreased cell mass in this model [20]. Our results show that LPS endotoxemia causes a direct intestinal mucosal injury (this is evident from increased Park\u2019s intestinal injury score) and leads to mucosal hypoplasia. The observed decreased bowel and mucosal weight, decreased mucosal DNA and protein, and decreased villus height and crypt depth in this model support this conclusion. The changes in body weight and small bowel morphology in the current report were similar to those observed in our previous experiment [20]. The data from the previous study [20] and the current one suggest that intestinal hypoplasia is the predominant feature of mucosal damage.",

In rats, oral insulin given in the postweaning period resulted in a significant increase in mucosal weight as well as intestinal DNA content and villus height. The maximal changes were observed in the first week of insulin treatment, and most significant changes were observed in the proximal intestine [17]. The present data clearly indicate that oral insulin had a strong stimulating effect on intestinal recovery from intestinal mucosal injury caused by LPS similar to that seen previously in suckling rats. Increased bowel and mucosal weight as well as mucosal DNA and protein support this conclusion. Parallel increases in mucosal DNA and protein indicate that the greater mucosal mass of animals treated with oral insulin can be attributed to cellular hyperplasia. Because the DNA content is directly proportional to mucosal cell number, these measurements exclude such factors as edema or vascular engorgement as responsible for differences in mucosal mass. Increased villus height may be the result of increased proliferation and accelerated migration along the villus, and is a marker for the increased absorptive surface area and increased numbers of epithelial cells. Increased mucosal proliferation in functioning intestine as demonstrated by the increased cell proliferation index following oral insulin administration together with decreased cell death via apoptosis, suggests an activated enterocyte turnover and may be considered a main mechanism of mucosal hyperplasia in recovering bowel. Our data indicate that oral insulin did not prevent the damaging effect of LPS on gut. This is evident from unchanged injury score scale following insulin administration.",

LPS, a well-known bacterial pyrogen, is recognized by several receptors, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, on various cells including enterocytes. TLR4 recognizes LPS and transduces a proinflammatory signal through the adapter molecule myeloid differentiation marker MyD88 [21]. Many studies in various experimental models have established that TLR4 expression in different organs and tissues is up-regulated following LPS administration. Janardhan et al. [22] have shown that TLR4 expression in lung is sustained up to 36 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. LPS-induced suppression of cardiac myocyte contractility is TLR4-dependent [23]. In accordance with other tissues, several experimental studies have shown that TLR4 mRNAs is upregulated in the small intestine after LPS administration [24]. The fact that the intestinal epithelium seems to be unresponsive to intestinal luminal LPS was explained by low or absent expression of TLR4, MD-2, and the co-receptor molecule CD14 in cells constituting the intestinal mucosal surface [25].",

Therefore, we suggest that the signaling pathways leading from LPS to TLR4 activation in jejunum and ileum may be different. Because the bacterial contamination in ileum is significantly greater than that in jejunum, the mechanism of the ubiquitous activation of TLR4 in the presence of LPS is limited in the ileum to protect the mucosa against massive amounts of bacteria and bacterial LPS present in the intestinal lumen and do not initiate acute inflammatory responses as would be elicited along mucosal surface in jejunum. Our observations are consistent with data of other investigators who note that the human intestine exhibits specific mechanisms for LPS tolerance, given its proximity to the enteric flora and their otherwise strong innate response to LPS [25\u201327].",

This increase of TLR4 expression together with increased LPS did not lead to mucosal damage in this group compared to LPS-animals. In contrast, LPS-INS rats showed a significantly enhanced cell turnover. It should be emphasized that parallel increase in LPS exposure and up-regulation of TLR4 expression has less significant damaging effect on intestinal mucosa compared to other organs and tissues. Indeed, insulin fragments themselves exert their stimulated effect on cell turnover through binding to the other receptors. It is likely that other specific growth-related genes are also up-regulated by insulin in the gastrointestinal tract. Similar to LPS, oral insulin exerted minimal effect on TLR4 expression in the ileum. This may be explained by the presence of bacteria in the ileum that may lead to a temporary insensitivity of cells toward subsequent LPS and insulin stimulation. The mechanism by which insulin increases TLR4 are unknown. Since one would assume that increased TLR4 is part of the LPS induced injury, it is reasonable to suggest that the adaptive response of the intestine to oral insulin is stronger than its effects on TLR4.",
