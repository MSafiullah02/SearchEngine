The completion of the sequencing of the first plant genome, reported to have 25,498 genes in Arabidopsis Thaliana. This research work has opened the horizons in the genomic era in plant research (Jeanette and Emon, 2016). By adding a specific gene to a plant, or knocking down a gene with RNAi, the desirable phenotype can be produced in a precise way as compared to traditional breeding techniques (Jeanette and Emon, 2016). Genomics provides controllable methods for molecular breeding and marker-assisted selection, and accelerates the development of new crop varieties (Jeanette and Emon, 2016). The science of genomics has assisted in the development of targeted vaccines of biopharmaceutical importance and industrial enzymes.",

Expression profiling helps in identifying proteins at a specific time and elucidates the function of particular proteins (Jeanette and Emon, 2016). Translational plant proteomics is further expansion of proteomics from expression to functional, structural, translation, and the manifestation of desired traits. By using translational proteomics, the outcomes of proteomics for food authenticity, food security and safety, energy sustainability, human health, increased economic values, and for maintaining ecosystem balance can be applied (Agrawal et al., 2012).

The recombinant DNA into Agrobacterium is cultured along with plant cells to be transformed (Streatfield, 2006). The testing of these antigens produced by transgenic plants in animal experiments showed that the genes successfully expressed in these plants (Mishra et al., 2008, Mariotti et al., 1989, Mercenier et al., 2001, Chikwamba et al., 2002, Yuki and Kiyono, 2003) Earlier this method was limited to tobacco and a few other species, but now it has been extended to vegetable species of agronomic interest like Graminae\nand Leguminosae (Chikwamba et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2001). This method has opened new prospects for the development of edible vaccines for humans as well as for veterinary use (Mishra et al., 2008).",

Liposomes are positively charged lipids and are used for DNA uptake due to their favorable interactions with negatively charged DNA and cell membranes (Darbani et al., 2008). In this approach external DNA is encapsulated in a spherical lipid bilayer (which is known as a liposome) to prepare lipoplexes (Gad et al., 1990). The endocytosis process makes the DNA free to recombine and integrate into the host genome Fukunaga et al., 1983). Viral vectors can also be used in this system. The successful transformation has been reported in various plants, e.g., in tobacco, wheat, and potato (Dekeyser et al., 1990, Zhu et al., 1993, Sawahel, 2002). Another example is transformation of intact yeast artificial chromosomes into plant cell, which was successfully achieved via lipofection-like particle bombardment. The lipofection\u2013polyethylene glycol combination method was more efficient than other methods (Darbani et al., 2008, Wordragen et al., 1997).\n",

The aim of edible or oral vaccine is to provide mucosal as well as humoral immunity against pathogens or infectious agents. When taken orally, edible vaccine undergoes mastication process and then enters into intestine for further degradation via enzymes and acids present in the gut. The antigens produced in transgenic plants are delivered through bioencapsulation in which the parts of plant are fed directly because the outer cell wall protects the antigens from gastrointestinal secretions. The antigen is released and taken up by microfold (known as M) cells in the intestinal wall present over Peyer\u2019s patches (rich in lymphoid tissues) and gut-associated lymphoid tissues, passed onto the macrophages, antigen-presenting cells, local lymphocytes\u2013producing serum immunoglobulins (IgG, local IgE), response and memory cells, and thereby neutralizing the attack of pathogen (Mishra et al., 2008, Ma et al., 1995).",

However, if it is from transgenic plants, then it is free from toxin (Geetika and Sanjana, 2014). The edible vaccines provide more immunity when compared to conventional vaccines because in later case the sugar attached to animal vaccines was not reckoned to be beneficial. Conventional vaccines are expensive, need sterilization conditions, purification, refrigeration for proper storage, have poor mucosal response, and require cold chain and trained medical personnel when compared to edible vaccines. Children have to experience pain for immunization and vaccination; therefore, noncompliance is observed. The edible vaccines bypass all these conditions, need not be administered with a needle and syringe, can be eaten, and noncompliance is not observed. There is no need of trained medical personnel, have good stability, do not require refrigeration, shipping cost is eliminated, cold chained is not required, and contamination is also not found. Moreover, edible vaccines are economical as compared to conventional vaccines because of mass production, transportation, ease of separation, and purification from plant materials.\n",

The transgenic plants were developed by CaMV (Cauliflower mosaic virus) plasmid cloned by HBSAg subtype and thus regenerated plants produced HBSAg from the transformed cells. Further experiments in potatoes showed higher concentration of expression antigen in roots than in leaf tissues and was not sufficient to be used for oral vaccine (Domansky, 1995). Further research was carried out to increase HBSAg levels using different promoters, e.g., patatin promoter and different transcriptional regulatory elements (Geetika and Sanjana, 2014). Artnzen and colleagues investigated a number of signaling peptides and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions in constructs driven by normally constitutive CaMV 35s promoter to develop transgenic potato with higher levels of HBSAg antigen (Artnzen, 1997).

For example, tomato plant expressing rabies could induce antibodies in mice. The transgenic potato produced from transgenic plant with CTB gene of Vibrio cholera was found to be very effective in mice. Transgenic potato expressing Norwalk virus antigen has shown seroconversion. Human trials of potato-based hepatitis B virus have shown good results. A study carried out by Mason et al. (1996) investigated the antigenic or immunogenic effects of transgenic potato tubers and tobacco leaves, carrying a Norwalk virus capsid protein; in mice, this virus causes gastroenteritis in human. A successful expression of antigens in plants was achieved for rabies virus G-protein in tomato (McGarvey et al., 1995). Rotavirus VP7 has been expressed in transgenic plants, and oral immunization in mice was observed by inducing the production of mucosal IgA and serum IgG against VP7 (Wu et al., 2003). The development of systemic and mucosal antibody response was observed in response to LT-B in young and aged mice. The expression of a recombinant subunit antigen (ORF2), representing the carboxy-terminal 267 amino acids of the 660 amino acid hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid protein of HEV was studied in tomatoes, and activity of protein or expressed antigen was tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay method (Ma et al., 2003). In addition, efforts have also been made to develop edible vaccine against neurocysticercosis that occurs due to ingestion of contaminated food and water by Taenia solium (Lightwlers, 2003). Vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has also been developed by scientists and is under study. These examples show that plants are promising bioreactors in generation of therapeutically desired biopharmaceuticals.",
