A novel coronavirus designated \u201cSARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)\u201d was responsible for the serious infectious disease (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003). Although the global outbreak of SARS was controlled and the virus had been isolated from wild animals (layan palm civets and raccoon dogs), the actual natural reservoir for SARS-CoV is still unknown and its reemergence in the future remains a possibility. To better prevent future SARS epidemics, protective vaccines and reliable diagnostic reagents must be developed to control this life-threatening disease.",

Of 60 selected phage clones, 43 (72%) immunopositive clones had significant enhancement of binding activity to SARS-CoV-specific antibodies but not to normal human serum (Fig. 1\n). The homology between peptide sequences of a series of epitopes inserted into target phages and the primary sequence of the structural protein of SARS-CoV was compared (Table 1\n). As seen in Table 1, the double selection process resulted in 12 different peptides, which could be divided into three groups: (1) nine peptides with homology to nine different regions of the SARS-CoV S protein; (2) two peptides with homology to two regions of the M protein; and (3) one peptide without any homology to the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Some peptides showed a striking resemblance (as its peptide sequence SHVPLATSRTLA contained six matches to the M protein sequence) and were isolated more than once (SHVPLATSRTLA was sequenced five times, Group 2 in Table 1). The majority of epitopes were isolated after both screens.",

To prove that the phage-borne peptides were the real epitopes of SARS-CoV, a peptide competitive-inhibition assay was performed to determine whether the synthetic peptide and the corresponding phage clone competed for the same antibody-binding site. In competitive-inhibition assay, the peptides dose-dependently blocked the binding of the corresponding phage clones to the targets (Fig. 2\n). Moreover, the four peptides reacted with SARS-CoV-specific serum antibody and did not cross-react with anti-HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 sera or healthy donor sera (Fig. 3\n).",

The specific antibody was still detectable on day 42 with high titer suggesting that a strong and relatively long-term humoral immune response was induced by each of the four B cell epitopes.

Although both the number of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreased simultaneously, the decrease was greater in the latter than the former. Consequently, the ratio of CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell was a little higher. However, the increase in CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell ratio was similar in the control group and all MAP-immunized groups, except the MAP2-immunized group on day 14. It suggested that these epitope-based peptides did not imbalance the immunological system. Subsequently, with the activation of T cells, the T cell/B cell ratio progressively returned to a normal level in all groups except the MAP2-immunized group at a low level. The results demonstrated that humoral immune response was predominant and was rapidly triggered by the epitope-based peptide, especially by MAP2.",

Fourteen days after primary immunization with MAP1 and MAP3, the number of IL-4-producing cells remained elevated (31\u201343 spots in 2 \u00d7 105 cells).

These data demonstrate that the four B cell epitopes were more effective enhancers of humoral immunity than cellular immunity. The results of antigen-specific lymphocyte cell proliferation assay indicated that each MAP dose-dependently stimulated a proliferative response and MAP3 was the most effective inducer of lymphocyte proliferation (Table 3\n).

This technique has been used mostly to screen with monoclonal antibodies, and little to screen with purified polyclonal antibody preparations (Folgori et al., 1994, Kay et al., 1993, Roberts et al., 1993, Liu et al., 2004). We were successful in screening with polyclonal antisera using this technique, probably because of the newly improved biopanning we adopted and the targets we chose. Anti-SARS-CoV serum contains mostly SARS-CoV antibodies and few antibodies to other pathogens. In conventional biopanning processes with anti-SARS-CoV sera as the only targets, nonspecific phage clones that do not bind to SARS-CoV-specific immunoglobulins but instead to antibodies specific to other pathogens might be amplified. In addition, some researchers reported that nonspecific clones not binding to the target but to the plastic of plate could also be chosen in several conventional biopanning procedures (Adey et al., 1995). We improved the biopanning procedure to avoid these possibilities and ensure specificity of selection. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab (as the simplest fragments with specificity of antibodies) facilitated the antigen specificity of our biopanning procedure.",

Moreover, we found another peptide sequence displayed by an immunopositive phage clone without homology to any primary sequence of SARS-CoV proteins. The structure of epitopes recognized and bound by B cell receptor (BCR) was shown to be linear or spatial by the classical experiments of Michael Sela 30 years ago (Sela, 1969). Phage-displayed peptide libraries are generated by shotgun cloning of random oligonucleotides into the 5\u2032 ends of either the pIII or pVIII genes of filamentous phage. The peptides encoded by inserted nucleotides are displayed on the phage surface and have independent spatial structure (Cwirla et al., 1990, Felici et al., 1993, Luzzago et al., 1993). So the non-homologous peptide sequence might reflect the presence of a discontinuous epitope of SARS-CoV. In addition, SARS-CoV is antigenically cross-reactive with other viruses, so the non-homologous peptide sequence might be also an epitope of a different virus. Certainly, this finding must be studied further. Among the linear epitopes, nine (81%) were considered to be S protein epitopes (five epitopes in S1 protein and four in S2 protein) and two (18%), M protein epitopes. The decrement tendency of numbers of epitopes of S1 protein, S2 protein, and M protein connected with the location of these proteins in the virion. Most (60%) of the epitopes were located in regions where predicted epitopes were known to exist, and a minority (24%) of epitopes were located about 6\u221213 amino acids away from the predicted epitope regions (Yuxian et al., 2005, Yanbo et al., 2003, Yanbo et al., 2004). And two were located in regions where the virus binds to the host cell receptor (ACE-II) (Wong et al., 2004).",

The increase was dramatically greater in the number of IL-4-producing cells than in the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells after immunization with these epitope-based peptides, confirming that humoral immunity was predominant. So, the epitopes we selected are real B cell epitopes. The specific antibody induced by the four epitopes persisted at least 6 weeks, which was confirmed by monitoring IgG titer. Although specific IgG could be detected after primary immunization, persistent high titer IgG required revaccination. It indicated the involvement of humoral immune memory. Within 1 week after revaccination, B cell numbers peaked, which indirectly proved that antigen-specific memory B cells could be induced by these epitope peptides. It suggested that these epitopes were potential for development of SARS vaccine. MAP2 and MAP4 induced rapid increase in the number of IL-4-producing cells to enhance the humoral immune indicated their potential uses for emergent prophylaxis of SARS; MAP1 and MAP3 induced relatively slow but persistent increase in that to enhance humoral immune indicated their potential uses for long-term prophylaxis of SARS.",

The first round of biopanning was performed on immobilized anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab to ensure all phage clones binding to it were included in the pool of the first screen. In other words, 4 \u00d7 1010 phages of the original library (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were immunoscreened with anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound phages were removed by washing and the bound phages were eluted with glycine\u2013HCl (0.2 M, pH 2.2, and 1 mg ml\u2212 1 BSA) and neutralized with Tris\u2013HCl (1 M, pH 9.0). After titration on LB/IPTG/X-gal (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) plates and amplification, 4 \u00d7 1010 first-round selected phages were immunoscreened with normal IgG Fab and the unbound phages were collected to remove phages not specific for anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab in the second biopanning. The protocols for the third and fourth immunoscreen were identical to that of the first round except 2 \u00d7 1011 phages particles were used as input and the Tween 20 concentration was increased for washing to 0.5% (v/v). The four rounds of biopanning were repeated once.",
