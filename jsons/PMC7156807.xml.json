The nasal bridge was the most commonly affected site (83.1%). As expected, frequent hand hygiene was associated with a higher incidence of hand dermatitis, but the length of time wearing the face shield was not significantly associated with the risk of facial lesions. It was not the N95 mask alone but rather goggles that were implicated in most injuries.",
