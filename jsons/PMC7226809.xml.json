The new coronavirus disease has received an official name, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the World Health Organization. It can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and infected patients have a relatively high risk of death [1,2,3]. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares 76% amino acid sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and is likely to use the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host cells [4,5,6]. Recent studies provide structural and functional evidence that SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells is recognized by full-length human ACE2 [7,8]. Another experimental study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 employs the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for host cell entry [5]. Collectively, structural and functional studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry.",

Liver function damage has been reported in SARS-infected and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected patients [9,10]. A recent epidemiologic study indicates that some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have signs of severe liver damage [1]. By analyzing healthy liver cells at single-cell resolution, investigators have determined that ACE2 is significantly enriched in cholangiocytes [11], suggesting that the virus might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function. Moreover, a recent study explored the composition and proportion of ACE2-expressing cells in the digestive system by scRNA-seq analysis, and its results showed that ACE2 is not only highly expressed in lung AT2 cells, the upper esophagus and stratified epithelial cells, but also in absorptive enterocytes in the ileum and colon [12], implying that the digestive system is a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, cardiovascular and urinary systems have been reported as potential organ targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection [13].",

SARS-infected male patients show wide-spread germ cell destruction, few or no spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubules, and a thickened basement membrane in the testes [14]. However, whether the reproductive system is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined. In this study, we investigate the RNA expression profiles of ACE2 in adult human testes at single-cell resolution. Our study documents that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. ACE2-positive cells possess higher abundance of transcripts associated with viral reproduction and transmission, and lower abundance of transcripts related to male gametogenesis. Thus, the reported ACE2 expression in human testes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the male gonad and risk male reproductive dysfunction.",

For the remaining cells, gene expression matrices were normalized to total cellular read count and to mitochondrial read count using the negative binomial regression method implemented in the Seurat SCTransform function. Cell-cycle scores were also calculated using the Seurat CellCycleScoring function since the cell cycle phase effect was observed. The gene expression matrices were then further normalized to cell cycle scores. The Seurat RunPCA functions were used to calculate the principal components (PCs). We further performed the batch effect correction using Harmony, because batch effects among the three human testis samples were observed. The RunUMAP function in its default setting was applied to visualize the first 35 Harmony-aligned coordinates.

A violin plot further demonstrated that ACE2 was highly expressed in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. Early spermatocytes, late spermatocytes, spermatids and other somatic cells had very low expression levels of ACE2, as displayed in Figure 2C. A recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for host cell entry, and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for viral spike (S) protein priming [5]. Feature and violin plots indicated that TMPRSS2 expression was concentrated in spermatogonia and spermatids with relatively low levels in other cell types, as shown in Figure 2B,D.

We found that 24 GO terms associated with viral reproduction and transmission were positively enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia and included viral gene expression (e.g., NUP133, POLR2A, JUN, RANBP2, RPL12, EIF3L, RPL3, RPL4, RPS19, RPS2, NUP85), the positive regulation of viral processes (e.g., TOP2A, RSF1, PPIA, CHMP2A, NUCKS1, TRIM11, POLR2B, NELFB, CHD1, NELFCD, TSG101), viral latency, the positive regulation of viral release from host cells, viral life cycle, viral translation, viral genome replication and viral budding, as displayed in Figure 4A,B. In contrast, multiple GO terms related to male reproduction were significantly decreased in ACE2-positive spermatogonia. These GO terms included male gamete generation (e.g., ADCY10, METTL3, RNF8, CDC42, SYCP1, DAZL, ETV5, YTHDC2, TEX14, REC8, TAF7L, YBX2, NANOS3, DDX4, SYCE3), spermatid differentiation (e.g., SPAG16, CFAP157, OCA2, RFX2, PYGO1, TTC26), fertilization (e.g., NECTIN2, PLB1, CCT7, NPM2, IZUMO1, SPAG8, CD9), sperm motility (e.g., SORD, ANXA5, SLC22A16, CFAP44, SLIRP), sperm capacitation (e.g., PEBP1, CATSPERD, SLC26A6, CATSPER3), sperm-egg recognition, acrosome reaction, sperm chromatin condensation and male meiosis, as shown in Figure 4A,B. The GSEA results suggest that male germ cell specific genes and genes that are collectively involved in spermatogenesis are compromised in ACE2-positive cells. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may directly target ACE2-positive spermatogonia and disrupt spermatogenesis.",

Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may replicate and transfer through cell\u2013cell junctions. Contrarily, some mitochondria and reproduction related GO terms were decreased in ACE2-positive cells, including mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondrial envelope, mitochondrial gene expression (e.g., MRPS18A, MRPL21, QRSL1, MTERF2, COA3, MRPL58, HARS, MTOL, RCC1L), mitochondrial translational termination, ATPase activator activity, fertilization, spermatid differentiation, sperm capacitation, sperm motility and sperm egg recognition, also displayed in Figure 5A,B.

In December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in patients that had similar respiratory symptoms with SARS and MERS. Until now, no effective drugs are clinically approved for these etiologic agents, but it appears that they share the same ACE2 receptor for entry into the host cells for reproduction and transmission [5,7,8]. Thus, the investigation of the composition and expression pattern of ACE2 may suggest potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Recent studies have shown that respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection [12,13]. Based on our current study of the scRNA-seq data in adult human testes, we suggest that the testis is also potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
