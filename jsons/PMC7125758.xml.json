            "text": "In the past decade a number of novel viral diseases have emerged, particularly in areas of Australia and Southeast Asia (Mackenzie and Field, 2004). These viral diseases include the highly pathogenic and zoonotic Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), both negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the new genus Henipavirus in the Paramyxoviridae family. NiV emerged in peninsula Malaysia in 1998 (Chua et al., 1999) while the closely related HeV (70\u201385% sequence homology to NiV) emerged in eastern Australia in 1994 (Murray et al., 1995b). Both HeV and NiV have neurological and pneumonic tropisms (Mackenzie and Field, 2004). The only two human HeV fatalities succumbed to either an acute respiratory disease or encephalitis (Murray et al., 1995a, Murray et al., 1995b, O'Sullivan et al., 1997). In horses, HeV infection presents more commonly as an acute respiratory syndrome (Mackenzie and Field, 2004). During NiV infection, the predominant clinical syndrome in humans was encephalitic with a smaller number in respiratory distress. In pigs, NiV infection was characterised by acute fever with respiratory involvement with or without neurological signs (Mackenzie and Field, 2004). Both viruses have continued to re-emerge on an almost annual basis, with NiV responsible for as many as 50 infections each year in Bangladesh and neighbouring India with case fatality rates of up to 90% (Icddr, 2003, Icddr, 2004a, Icddr, 2004b, Icddr, 2005).",

            "text": "The initial NiV outbreak in Malaysia resulted in 265 human cases of encephalitis, including 105 deaths. In an attempt to control the outbreak, 1.1 million pigs were culled. The majority of human cases were males who had direct contact with the pigs or pig products and epidemiological evidence suggested that the primary means of spread between farms and between regions was the movement of pigs (Mackenzie and Field, 2004). Seroepidemiological studies confirmed the reservoir host for both these viruses to be fruit bats of the genus Pteropus in the suborder Megachiroptera (Yob et al., 2001, Young et al., 1996). It has been proposed that NiV passed from bats to pigs to initiate the outbreak (Daszak et al., 2006, Mackenzie et al., 2003). However, many of the recent outbreaks of NiV in Bangladesh and India have no apparent association with an animal source. It is probable that epidemiological investigations may have been inadequate to demonstrate this (Mackenzie and Field, 2004).",

            "text": "Of particular concern is the recent observation of human-to-human transmission in some of the Bangladesh outbreaks, not before seen with either NiV or HeV (Gurley et al., 2007). Significantly, NiV has been isolated from human respiratory secretions (Chua et al., 2001, Gurley et al., 2007). There are currently no vaccines or post-exposure therapeutics specifically indicated for Henipavirus infection. A limited non-randomised trial of ribavirin during the initial NiV outbreak in Malaysia showed ribavirin therapy reduced the mortality associated with acute NiV encephalitis (Chong et al., 2001). While this study reported no serious side effects, ribavirin has been associated with a range of side effects primarily related to haemolytic anaemia (De Franceschi et al., 2000). Ribavirin has also been shown to be effective against HeV in vitro, where virus yield was reduced more than 50-fold (Wright et al., 2005). A more recent study showed that the 5-ethyl analogue of ribavirin, but not ribavirin, was able to prevent mortality in five of six animals in a hamster model of NiV infection (Georges-Courbot et al., 2006) suggesting that other replication inhibitors may be effective against henipaviruses. While there are a number of therapy options being explored experimentally including active and passive vaccination, fusion inhibition and receptor blockade, there is clearly a need for further advances in this area.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved eukaryotic pathway involved in RNA-guided gene silencing. RNAi consists of several pathways in which sequence-specific mRNA is degraded. The core feature of RNAi detected in all organisms is the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Hammond, 2005). Long dsRNA is cleaved by an enzyme called dicer into siRNAs. These siRNAs are then incorporated into a complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that mediates gene silencing. A number of studies have demonstrated the inhibition of replication of RNA viruses in vitro by RNAi, including polio virus (Gitlin et al., 2005), HIV (Fanning et al., 2003, Han et al., 2004, Novina et al., 2002), hepatitis C virus (Yokota et al., 2003) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Lu et al., 2004, Zheng et al., 2004). There are also a few reports on the in vivo inhibition of viruses by RNAi, including hepatitis B virus (Giladi et al., 2003, McCaffrey et al., 2003) and foot and mouth disease virus (Chen et al., 2004). Data from the first RNAi therapeutic to enter human clinical development for an infectious disease has been promising. ALN-RSV01 an RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, demonstrated the drug was safe and well tolerated when administered intranasally to adult human volunteers in Phase I clinical trials (DeVincenzo et al., 2008). These studies indicate that RNAi has enormous therapeutic potential for a number of serious infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Henipaviruses appear to be good targets for inhibition via RNAi as they are RNA viruses without any DNA intermediates during their entire life cycle. Because the genomic RNA of henipaviruses is negative sense, transcription must occur before viral proteins are expressed. The transcription complex consisting of the polymerase (L) and phosphoprotein (P) proteins initiates transcription at the 3\u2032 terminus of the genomic RNA. Monocistronic capped and polyadenylated mRNAs are synthesized for each viral gene. An intergenic region consisting of a GAA trinucleotide exists between each gene. Immediately upstream of the gene junctions, the transcription complex encounters a stop signal and then either proceeds to initiate transcription of the next gene downstream or disengages from the viral RNA to reinitiate transcription at the 3\u2032 terminus. Therefore, the relative abundance of a viral transcript varies inversely with its distance from the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome. As free nucleoprotein (N) accumulates in the cytoplasm, the polymerase switches from transcription to genome replication and reads through the stop signal and intergenic regions to synthesize full-length plus sense viral RNA that serves as a template for synthesis of negative sense, genomic RNA (Bellini et al., 1998, Lamb et al., 2001). Unlike vaccines that require the recipients to have a normal immune system, siRNA-based treatment does not depend on a functional immune system and hence, may be used in elderly and immunocompromised individuals as well.",

This system has been subsequently enhanced with these modified reporter systems involved replacing the CAT reporter with an eGFP reporter gene (Magoffin et al., 2007) or utilising a HeV minigenome with a Renilla luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (gift from Linfa Wang). Briefly for these constructs, or construction of the eGFP reporter minigenome a DNA fragment containing the NiV L 3\u2032 UTR, NiV trailer region and T7 promoter sequence was amplified by PCR. A second DNA fragment containing the NiV leader region, NiV N 5\u2032 UTR, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV) sequence and two T7 terminator sequences was also amplified by PCR. The CAT reporter gene was removed from a plasmid by digestion and all DNA parts were then ligated, generating the pNiV-GFP or pHeV-LUC minigenomes. The precise initiation site of the T7 promoter, and the self-cleavage of the RNA at the 3\u2032 end by the HDV ribozyme, ensured that the minigenome had identical genome termini to the complete viral genomic RNA (Halpin et al., 2004, Magoffin et al., 2007). The rule of six was maintained in both minigenomes. For paramyxoviruses the N, P and L genes are all required for genome replication (Neumann et al., 2002). The reporter gene can only be detected when plasmids encoding the minigenome, NiV N gene, NiV P gene and NiV L gene were transfected into mammalian cells (Halpin et al., 2004, Magoffin et al., 2007).",

Previous studies have indicated that siRNAs with 3\u2032 overhanging UU dinucleotides are the most effective, consequently all RNA transcripts used for chemical synthesis begin with an AA dinucleotide (Elbashir et al., 2001). Additionally, as chemical synthesis makes use of T7 RNA polymerase, an 8 nt sequence complementary to the T7 promoter sequence was also added to the 3\u2032 of each designed oligonucleotide, 5\u2032-CCTGTCTC-3\u2032. Kim and colleagues have previously suggested that 27 bp siRNAs are more effective than 21 mers (Kim et al., 2004).

However, quantitation of GFP expression in monolayers requires intensive digital microscopy and image analysis prompting us to modify this system to one more amenable to automated screening. Subsequent experiments were all performed using a HeV minigenome construct containing a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter. Halpin and colleagues (Halpin et al., 2004) showed that the support plasmids for the HeV and NiV minigenomes are interchangeable enabling simple substitution without extensive reoptimisation. A luciferase-based assay is not only more sensitive than GFP-based assays, the time to measure expression of the reporter gene was reduced from 72 to 24 h, vastly improving cell viability due to lipofectamine toxicity. Preliminary studies evaluating the optimum transfection efficiency with minimal lipofectamine-induced toxicity indicated that all transfections be carried out for 6 h only, followed by removal of transfection media and replacement with maintenance media. Utilising this LUC minigenome assay, all the siRNAs that targeted the N gene of NiV partially inhibited HeV minigenome replication (30\u201350% inhibition), while only two of the four L gene specific siRNA effectively inhibited (50% and 80%) replication (Fig. 1\n).

Furthermore siN600 and si1219 contained 2 and 5 nt mismatches resulting in <30% and <15% inhibition of HeV infection, respectively. To evaluate whether the decrease in siRNA efficacy in silencing its target sequence (inhibiting viral replication) was related to nt mismatches, HeV-specific siRNAs were designed against HeV sequence at the identical nucleotide position as the siN600 and si1219 of NiV (designated siN600(HeV) and si1219(HeV)). BHK-21 cells were transfected with siRNA and infected with virus as described above. Results show that the HeV-specific siRNAs are now more effective at inhibiting HeV than NiV (Fig. 3\n) although we observed less overall inhibition than in previous experiments. Despite improved homology, siN1219(HeV) is still not very effective (<25%) against HeV infection in contrast to the equivalent NiV siRNA (>45% inhibition of NiV). These results support the hypothesis that the more mismatches the siRNA contains, the less effective it becomes in silencing its target. One mismatch appears to have only a minor effect in terms of efficacy in silencing the target sequence, but two or more mismatches dramatically reduce the efficacy of the siRNA in silencing its target.",

            "text": "Given the additional constraints involved with performing antiviral assays against BSL4 agents in vitro, the development of surrogate assays to screen and evaluate antivirals at BSL2 is important. Both NiV (Negrete et al., 2005, Negrete et al., 2006) and HeV (Porotto et al., 2007, Porotto et al., 2006) pseudotype assays have recently been developed providing excellent surrogate BSL2 assays for the evaluation of virus entry and fusion mechanisms, enabling wider access for potential antiviral evaluation. However, as these pseudotype viruses are either replication deficient, or rely on the replication proteins of the pseudotype virus (VSV), they may not be applicable for specific henipavirus gene knockdown and subsequent siRNA evaluation. In the current study we have compared a minigenome replication assay (Halpin et al., 2004), also requiring no infectious virus, with live virus assays to evaluate candidate siRNA molecules as potential antivirals. Comparison of the results obtained in the live virus assay with the results obtained in the minigenome assay reveals an interesting observation. Using the minigenome, two out of the four siRNAs targeting the L gene of NiV were effective inhibitors of viral replication (inhibiting expression of a luciferase reporter), whereas all of the siRNAs that targeted the N gene of NiV partially inhibited minigenome replication. In contrast, when the siRNAs were tested against live virus infection, none of the siRNAs targeting the L gene were effective inhibitors of viral replication, and only three out of the four siRNAs targeting the N gene were effective. The differences within these two assays between siRNAs targeting different genes might have several explanations. Minigenome replication is dependent on T7-mediated expression of support proteins, a step that does not occur in a naturally infected cell. Thus, the dynamics of siRNA inhibition of plasmid gene expression may be markedly different from in situ virus gene inhibition. Further, the minigenome system is a surrogate assay used to evaluate siRNA inhibition of viral replication in the absence of most of the other viral proteins present when live virus is used. This suggests that results obtained using this surrogate assay may not necessarily correspond to the results obtained in vitro using live viruses. Quite simply, the minigenome assay is a relatively restricted assay system containing only the essential elements for replication, which might explain why the greater efficacy of the siRNAs targeting the L gene (encoding the viral polymerase) of NiV compared to the siRNAs targeting the N gene. Alternatively, the shorter length of the siRNAs targeting the N gene (21 nt) compared to the L gene targets (27 nt) may reduce the strength of binding to the target sequence, reducing their efficacy. Further experiments using equivalent length siRNA molecules are needed to address this. The fact that in the live virus assay the siRNAs targeting the N gene were very effective in inhibiting viral replication while the L gene targets appeared to have little to no effect appears more complex. This may reflect the relative abundance of the N protein compared to the L protein during the early stages of viral replication. The switch of the polymerase from \u2018transcriptive mode\u2019 to \u2018replicative mode\u2019 is thought to be triggered by the intracellular accumulation of viral protein, most probably the N protein necessary for RNA encapsidation (Barik, 2004, Bellini et al., 1998, Lamb et al., 2001).",

We have identified several siRNA molecules as effective inhibitors of NiV and HeV infection, however, a number of additional targets remain to be tested. If viral gene transcript abundance is crucial to siRNA efficacy, molecules targeted to the phosphoprotein (P) gene may also be highly effective. While the P protein plays an essential role in the formation and function of the polymerase complex (Eaton et al., 2006), the P gene of henipaviruses is also predicted to encode for an additional three proteins, V, W, and C (Harcourt et al., 2000, Wang et al., 1998). While the target of the C protein is not known, it has been shown that NiV P, V and W proteins all act on the IFN signaling or JAK/STAT pathway by a distinct mechanism involving direct inhibition of STAT1, through a domain in their common N terminus (Rodriguez and Horvath, 2004, Shaw et al., 2004). Due to its conserved role in all three proteins, this region in particular may prove to be an attractive target for siRNA-mediated inhibition. Similarly, the pivotal role of the matrix (M) protein in viral budding indicated by VLP studies (Ciancanelli and Basler, 2006) suggests M gene targets may also inhibit key points in the viral life cycle. While the G and F proteins might appear to be attractive targets due to their central roles in receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively, their physical exposure to antigenic pressures makes them more susceptible to mutation, facilitating viral escape from antiviral therapy. While escape from siRNA-mediated inhibition is likely to be governed quite differently to antigenic mutation pressures, we anticipate that surface proteins are likely to be inherently more variable than unexposed proteins (Harcourt et al., 2005).",

            "text": "An important observation in the current study is the apparent cumulative effect of multiple siRNA treatment. This strategy may provide the most effective approach currently available to limiting the development of antiviral resistance. Single siRNA therapy may ultimately be susceptible to viral escape via selective mutations but the use of multiple gene targets makes viral escape much less likely. Additionally, previous studies of influenza escape mutants suggest these are likely to have reduced viral fitness (Carr et al., 2002, Herlocher et al., 2002, Ives et al., 2002, McKimm-Breschkin, 2000). Logically, the combination of several barriers to virus infection (multiple siRNA targets) should reduce the likelihood of viral escape. However, studies have shown that the effective concentration of siRNAs may reach a plateau (Kamath et al., 2001), suggesting that the RNAi-induced silencing complexes of the cell are saturable. Further studies with multiple siRNA targets are necessary to adequately evaluate this effect both in vitro and in vivo.",

We have identified a number of N gene targets effective against live virus infection. Additionally, we observed an inverse correlation between the number of nucleotide mismatches and the efficacy of siRNA inhibition. Given the high homology between HeV and NiV, individual virus specificity may be attained by targeting slightly heterologous regions. Alternatively, broad-spectrum antiviral activity may be achieved by selecting strictly homologous targets. Given the recurrent re-emergence of these viruses and the current lack of therapeutic intervention, the demonstration that RNAi effectively inhibits henipavirus replication in vitro, provides a novel approach and may provide an effective therapy for these highly lethal zoonotic pathogens.",
