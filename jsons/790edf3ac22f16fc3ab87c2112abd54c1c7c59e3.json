Hippocrates taught that the human hand can be used to judge the presence of fever as early as 400 BC, but instruments to measure this temperature were not developed until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Even then, the journey to the routine measurement of temperature in clinical practice was a long one, with many different people contributing to the arrival of the small, inexpensive, and accurate instrument known throughout the world as 'the clinical thermometer'. A thermometer is essentially an instrument that can measure temperature. It detects changes in physical properties of an object or substance as the temperature of the object changes. The expansion and contraction of air with changes in temperature was noted as early as 220 BC by Philo of Byzantium. It was later realized that water also has this property, as do other fluids and metals such as mercury. As a result, there are now many different forms of thermometers which have been developed over a period of several hundred years.",

It was, of course, found that when carrying such a device up a mountain to a different altitude that the level in the tube was affected by the changing atmospheric pressure. These devices illustrated changes in sensible heat, before the concept of temperature had been recognized. While it is sometimes claimed that Galileo was the inventor of the thermometer, what he actually produced was a thermoscope. He did discover that glass spheres filled with aqueous alcohol of different densities would rise and fall with changing temperature. Today, this is the principle of the Galilean thermometer, which is calibrated with a temperature scale.",

At the end of the sealed tube, he had a bulb blown of the optimal size to be inserted in the mouth. The open end was submersed in fluid. As the air expanded due to the oral temperature, fluid was expelled from the tube. After a fixed period of time, the bulb was removed, the air cooled, causing the fluid to rise in the calibrated tube ( Fig. 3.1 ) [1] . The ThermomeTer",

This was the first thermometer to depend on the expansion and contraction of a liquid, which was independent of barometric pressure. Many variants of this concept appeared, each unique as there was no standard scale. Christian Huygens in 1665 suggested using the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water as standards. The Danish astronomer Ole R\u00f8mer in Copenhagen used these upper and lower limits for a thermometer that he used to record the weather. There was still uncertainty about how well these parameters would work at different geographical latitudes. In 1694, Carlo Renaldini suggested that the ice and boiling water limits should be adopted as a universal scale. In England, Isaac Newton proposed in 1701 that a scale of 12 \u00b0C could be used between melting ice and body temperature!",

It was this that led to their general adoption. Fahrenheit first calibrated his thermometer with ice and sea salt as zero. Salt water has a much lower freezing point than ordinary water, so he chose the freezing point as 30 \u00b0F. The temperature inside the healthy human mouth was 96 \u00b0F, and he established the boiling point of water at 212 \u00b0F. He later adjusted his freezing point to 32 \u00b0F, so he established 180 \u00b0F between boiling and freezing which he measured at sea level [2] .",

He was appointed as professor of astronomy at Uppsala (as his father had been before him) and was involved in meteorological surveys. Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments leading to the establishment of an international temperature scale based on scientific data. (He was for many years secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences at Uppsala.) His paper 'Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer' described his detailed experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude and atmospheric pressure.

His treatise was based on regular temperature measurements made on all his patients over the course of 15 years, some as many as four to six times daily. After some 100,000 observations, Wunderlich showed that when the temperatures were plotted on charts, the disease could be shown to follow certain laws, which could be characterized by the trend in temperature. Overall, he studied some 25,000 specific cases. This was clearly a significant contribution to the subject and places Wunderlich at the forefront of discovery in this aspect of clinical observation. He had established that the temperature in a healthy person is constant and that variation of temperature occurs in disease. From this, Wunderlich laid down a code based on principles that he had derived from his large set of observations.

In the full text of Temperature in Diseases, Wunderlich provides a most comprehensive list of investigators, mainly German and European, who had studied the role of thermometry in man and animals. He also discusses the various sites on the human body where thermometry may be applied. Of the many potential areas, he showed that in the hand or between fingers and toes was too unreliable. Rectal and vaginal sites were also criticized, the former being affected by masses of faeces, and the latter lacking in clinical evidence of reliability. The axilla and the mouth were advocated, with warnings of the effects of ingestion of food and drink, and or oral breathing when suffering from nasal congestion.",

In this way a physician could carry a stethoscope and a thermometer in his personal kit, thus increasing the use of temperature measurement in diagnosis.",

A local company, Harvey and Reynolds, first manufactured this special thermometer in 1867, followed by Thackeray in London. Allbutt made the design of his thermometer freely available to others, and it was quickly taken up by British physicians. It was notable in that the instrument, 15 centimetres long, had a constriction in the capillary tube that held the mercury at its reading after use, until shaken down to the lower limit of calibration ( Fig. 3.3) .",

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, this technology came into practical use, accelerated by the needs of the military during the Second World War. In the late 1950s, once infrared technology had been declassified, thermal imaging became available to medicine and industry. Although the early systems were slow scanners, it became clear that it was possible to record the temperature distribution of a human subject or an object. An important conference in 1964 at the New York Academy of Sciences revealed the true potential of this technology in the study of human body temperature [11] .",

In contrast to the very expensive early thermal imaging systems, this device promised a low cost and reliable means of measuring temperature close to the brain, but without the invasive contact of thermocouples. Initially only used for military and space technology, the tympanic radiometer came into medicine some 30 years later. This was undoubtedly stimulated by the concerns about the use of mercury on thermometers and its subsequent banning. The radiometer was further developed in the United States for measuring temperature over the temporal artery and was also used to measure forehead temperature. The latter application is not always successful, as the forehead may be a site of profuse sweating, either from physical exertion or from fever.",

This has led to the International Standards Organization publishing documents to highlight the essential requirements of thermal imaging cameras and their optimal use in this application. From this work, it is now established that a close-up thermogram of the subject's frontal face can be used to measure the temperature of the inner canthus of the eye and so to detect fever by remote sensing (see Chap. 3) [13, 14] .",
