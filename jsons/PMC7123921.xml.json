Since that time, other bacteria, including S. pneumoniae, GAS, S. aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis, can cause epiglottitisOccurs primarily inchildren aged 2\u20137 years.The clinical triad of drooling, dysphagia, and distress is the classic presentationFever with associated respiratory distress or air hunger occurs in most patientsTreatment in patients with epiglottitis is directed toward relieving the airway obstruction and eradicating the infectious agentOptimally, initial treatment is provided by a pediatric anesthesiologist and either a pediatric surgeon or apediatric otolaryngologist\n\nBuccal infections\nBuccal cellulitis previously was always caused by H. influenzae infection before the vaccineAlways associated with bacteremia if presentPresent with palpable cellulitis on both checks, purplish in color, and child looksvery toxic\n\nPeriorbital cellulitis\nPreviously H. influenzae was a common cause, now S. pneumoniae bacteria is the most common etiology associated with sinusitisMinor trauma or insect bite of the eyelid usually associated with preseptal cellulitis due to S. aureus or a Group A Streptococcus\n\nPyogenic arthritis\nH. influenzae was themost common cause of septic arthritis in children lessthan 2 years of agebefore Hib vaccine\n\nOccult bacteremia\nOccult bacteremia with H. influenzae will result in in 30\u201350% developing meningitis or other deep orfocal infection from occult bacteremiaAll occult bacteremiafrom H. influenzae has to be treated immediately\n\nPneumonia\n Pneumonia from H. influenzae used to cause about one-third of bacterialpneumonia before Hibvaccine and was associated with pleural effusion and positive blood culture in most cases\n\nTreatment (in patient with life-threatening illness)\nRemember: The organism produces beta lactamase, which makes amoxicillin ineffectiveCefotaxime or ceftriaxone is theantimicrobial of choiceMeropenem or chloramphenicol is another optionAmoxicillin is the drug of choice for noninvasive diseases such as otitis media or sinusitis; if amoxicillin fails, uses antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains, e.g., nontypeable H. influenzae including amoxicillin/clavulanate, TMP-SMX, azithromycin, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, andcefpodoxime.\n\nRifampin antibiotic prophylaxis for contact with invasive Hib infection\nAll members of household who did not receive immunizationLess than4 years with incomplete immunizationYounger than 12 months who did not complete primary Hib immunizationImmunocompromised childNursery school and childcare center if two or more cases within 60 days (outbreak)\n\n",

A positive sputum culture for Candida may represent colonization and should be taken in the clinical context.Rash that begins on wrists and ankles, spreading centrally to palms/soles, is likely Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Treat with doxycyclineno matter what age.Children who return from travel to the Middle East or Central America with ulcerative skin lesions and no systemic symptoms may have cutaneous Leishmaniasis.Kingella kingae is an etiologic agent of indolent septic arthritis or osteomyelitis in a young child. Can also cause bacteremia in infants and endocarditis in older children.Uncommon causes of fever in pediatrics include osteomyelitis, intraabdominal abscess, deep venous thrombosis, Still disease, recurrent fever syndromes (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA), and familial Mediterranean fever).CNS complications of HIV include infection (cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, CMV encephalitis, neurocysticercosis), lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), peripheral neuropathy, and HIV encephalopathy.Nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause unilateral submandibular lymphadenitis with a violaceous hue in young children. Primary treatment is surgical excision, not antibiotics. Excision prevents fistula formation.Most mild community-acquired pneumonia can be treated as outpatient with oral amoxicillin as first-line therapy in patients who can tolerate oral fluids.The most common etiology for osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is S. aureus. Persons with sickle cell disease are at higher risk for Salmonella.For post-exposure rabies prophylaxis, administer rabies immune globulin at the bite site and rabies vaccine at a contralateral site on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 (four total doses of vaccine). For immunocompromised persons (HIV), a fifth dose of rabies vaccine is given on day 28.To avoid botulism in the 1st year of life, avoid giving infants prepared cereals that contain honey, as these may also be a potential source.For TB testing, can use an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) for children > 2 years of age. Use skin testing for younger children.\n",
