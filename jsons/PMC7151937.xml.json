            "text": "Understanding the mechanisms by which DNA vaccines induce antigen-specific immunity is of considerable importance. To put it simply, an antigen sequence of interest is optimized and inserted into a mammalian expression plasmid vector.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 For clinical use, such vectors tend to share specific features, including a high-copy-number origin of replication for production purposes, a human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV-IE) promoter to drive expression in vivo, an RNA polyadenylation sequence (usually derived from bovine growth hormone or a similar sequence) to facilitate ribosome function, and a plasmid growth selection sequence such as a limited kanamycin bacterial gene or a nonantibiotic selection sequence to maintain stable expression of the plasmid of interest during production.15\n,\n17 The plasmid vaccine is delivered to the skin (intradermally) or muscle by one of several delivery methods. Once inside the cytoplasm of the cell, the plasmid enters the nucleus of transfected local cells (eg, myocytes, keratinocytes, or local resident antigen presenting cells [APCs]).26, 27, 28 Inside these cells, the plasmid-encoded sequences drive host cell transcription, resulting in production of the foreign antigen in vivo. These host-synthesized antigens then become the subject of immune surveillance in the context of both MHC class I and class II molecules of the vaccinated host. There are specific differences between DNA vaccination and live infection. For DNA, antigen delivery remains local after plasmid transfection into cells, as there can be little spreading of antigen expression to other regions of the body. The plasmids themselves are not live but inert; they represent a focused antigen, epitope, or multiple antigens of the pathogen rather than the entire pathogen.",

            "text": "The exact details of DNA vaccine-induced immunity remain a subject of debate. Intramuscular (IM) injection is the most common mode of DNA vaccine delivery and has been shown to induce CD8+ T-cell responses with more limited antibody production.7 For IM injection, it is likely that myocytes are directly transfected after vaccination. Dendritic cells transfected in muscle have also been shown to efficiently cross-present antigens to activate CTL and may play a role in activating MHC I restricted T cells after intramuscular vaccination.27 Alternatively, APCs in the muscle can be directly transfected and express antigen via the MHC I pathway to activate CTL.29 In contrast to IM injection, intradermal (ID) administration has been reported to result in a more robust humoral response consisting of IgG1 antibody production.4\n,\n30 The dermis is rich in APCs such as Langerhans and dendritic cells, which may enhance vaccine-induced immunity. ID vaccination, like IM vaccination, may result in APC transfection and antigen secretion, MHC class I presentation, or MHC class II presentation through cross-representation presentation. APCs are also constantly sampling the environment through endocytosis, resulting in the uptake of secreted antigen and expression, predominantly on MHC class II cells. Additionally, activated APCs express chemokines that may enhance immune cell trafficking of activated antigen-specific cells. Substantial work continues in this area.",

These studies examined diverse DNA vaccines for a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic applications, including first HIV-1,31 influenza, cancer antigens, hepatitis B, and malaria,32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and others.37 Although the initial DNA vaccine studies in humans demonstrated excellent tolerability and safety,15\n,\n37 the immune responses they elicited were weaker than expected on the basis of preclinical data, stimulating concerns about the technology's immune potency. These concerns drove the development of the important prime-boost field, which combined the immune focus of the DNA platform with the immune expansion power of live recombinant vaccine platforms.38\n",

Although these viral platforms induced strong antigen-specific cellular responses in preclinical models, preexisting poxvirus or adenovirus immunity has been reported to diminish the immune responses induced by immunization with the matching recombinant vaccine vector.47, 48, 49 This limits the potency of these vectors in multiple-dose regimens. Furthermore, other issues regarding preexisting immunity are also possible and problematic.50 As the DNA approach could induce a small but focused immune response that could be expanded by the subsequent boost with a recombinant vector encoding the same antigen as the DNA vaccine, this combination was viewed as a boon to the development of focused immune responses.",

DNA prime\u2013pox-viral boosting is one preferred strategy, as well as boosting by adenoviral vectors and by recombinant protein antigens, among others. Studies by GeoVax (a biotechnology company) in collaboration with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) showed that DNA priming followed by MVA boosting in humans can drive high levels of CD4 T-cell responses against HIV antigens and some level of antibody responses, which has moved this vaccine program forward.59 The NIH Vaccine Research Center (VRC) reported on a phase 1 trial using a DNA prime and a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector as a boost, which demonstrated that this approach induced both cellular and humoral immune responses against HIV antigens.49\n,\n60 Currently, a focused phase 2 study is evaluating this regimen of an HIV-1 DNA prime followed by a rAd5 boost for its ability to prevent infection or to reduce viral loads in study participants who become infected after vaccination.61\n",

Major areas that have been addressed are plasmid construction and design, including the optimization of promoters and enhancer elements; polyadenylation;68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 incorporation of leader sequences;79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 vector design; antibiotic resistance and selection sequences; origin of replication choices for production; and efficient slimmer backbone designs deleted of extraneous DNA sequences, all of which can contribute to improved platform performance. An important consideration for increasing plasmid-driven immune potency involves sequence optimization.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 Bacterial RNA is rich in AU sequences, whereas mammalian DNA is rich in GC. Therefore, the pool of tRNAs needed for translation in human cells is favored for sequences enriched in GC. Because of the redundancy in codon usage, unique transcriptional differences exist between bacteria, diverse viruses, parasites, and even host tumor antigens, which may benefit from attention to genetic design. DNA sequences can be codon-optimized to favor tRNA pools available in human cells, allowing the encoded mRNA to be more efficiently translated.",

For example, sequences rich in GC are more likely to form secondary structures and slow translation, lowering in vivo protein production. RNA optimization also involves removing internal cis-acting motifs such as TATA boxes, repeat sequences that can cause instability, cryptic splice sites, and unwanted ribosomal binding sites. A combination of these and other gene optimization strategies can have a dramatic positive effect on protein expression and vaccine immunogenicity.100, 101, 102 More recent studies have examined some of these improved approaches in the clinic. For example, a study of a West Nile virus vaccine DNA using an improved promoter induced relevant antibody responses in most of the 30 trial participants.267 This study extended the findings reported in trials of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Ebola plasmid vaccines, which resulted in positive serology induced by the vaccine, with lower T-cell responses.103\n,\n104\n",

            "text": "A major advantage of the DNA platform is the ability to rapidly customize the vaccine antigens with high precision to address specific vaccine design limitations. For example, the diversity in the HIV envelope sequence can reach greater than 15% within a subtype and greater than 30% between clades, and similar diversity issues plague influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and malaria vaccine development, among others. Therefore, vaccination with a single viral sequence is unlikely to drive the diversity of responses necessary for cross-protection from the variety of sequences circulating in the population. Approaches to overcome these limitations combine computer predictions for immunogen design with synthetic chemistry to generate vaccine antigens that improve on nature. Important approaches include consensus antigen, ancestor gene, and center-of-tree designs;105, 106, 107, 108 mosaic antigens;109, 110, 111 or epitope string approaches.112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117 All of these approaches seek to focus the immune response induced by a synthetic gene cassette to specific epitopes or regions of a native antigen or an antigen predicted by computer analysis to be more conserved or invariant in the population. These strategies seek to maximize cross-reactivity of the T-cell responses induced against divergent strains of the pathogen. Consensus antigens, mosaic antigens, and epitope strings are currently being studied in the clinic, and these studies should be highly informative.",

These compounds can have dual roles, facilitating plasmid entry into the cell as well as providing an adjuvant effect.

In addition to polymers, ongoing studies have shown that liposome vehicles can improve DNA vaccine-induced immune responses. Studies in general support a greater effect on antibody responses than on improved T-cell responses. As liposomes have structural versatility with regard to the resulting vesicle surface charge (both cationic and anionic liposomes can be made), size, lipid content, and codelivery with other adjuvants, they offer the ability to be customized for specific DNA applications.89\n,\n90\n,\n93, 94, 95, 96 The formulation of DNA vaccines in polyamine gels or nanoparticles has also been reported to increase the uptake of plasmid vectors and increase antigen expression in vivo.

The concept is simple\u2014physically forcing more plasmid DNA into cells will improve expression. Many studies support this idea. Improvements in immune responses have been generated by several simple delivery devices such as the gene gun or biolistic jet injection.131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140 Jet injection involves using high pressure to deliver a liquid formulation of DNA millimeters to centimeters below the skin's surface. The major limitations to clinical use of jet injection are the requirement for large amounts of DNA, and the DNA degradation from the high-pressure delivery. However, it is a relatively simple technique that has shown improved immune responses compared with needle and syringe in experimental model systems. Uniquely, the gene gun uses high pressure to deliver DNA-coated gold nanoparticles to the dermis. Although the gene gun has demonstrated high transfection efficiency and enhanced antibody responses in several species including humans, it has had relatively little effect toward improving cellular immunity.",

Over the past 10 years, EP technology has been much developed, leading to devices capable of performing intramuscular, intradermal, and microneedle transfection in vivo.20\n,\n21 One exciting development is that in large-animal models, EP has increased both cellular and humoral immune responses,22\n,\n23 and when combined with other optimization approaches, the magnitude of the immune responses generated by the combined DNA approach has increased more than a log.100\n,\n141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147 EP technology can also be fine tuned to a particular DNA vaccine modality, as devices that control different current, voltage, and timing settings are being developed. Combinations with molecular adjuvants look highly promising,125\n,\n148\n,\n149 and delivery to the skin and muscle is also being tested. Importantly, EP has been safely studied in the clinic for many years. More work is needed in this area, but the data in the primate models and the early reports from the clinic appear very encouraging.",

Many initial safety concerns have now been addressed. It appears that the risks associated with DNA vaccines are relatively low compared with those of some other approaches. An initial fear of DNA vaccines was the risk of integration and activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. However, studies have demonstrated that the rate of DNA integration in vivo is actually three times lower than the rate of spontaneous mutagenesis. In addition, no negative effects such as induction of autoimmunity or transfer of antibiotic resistance markers have been observed. With the renewed clinical interest in this approach, thousands of volunteers have received DNA vaccines without a single significant adverse event having been reported.",

In fact, the number of DNA vaccines being tested in clinical studies compared with all other recombinant platforms has increased from just 4% 10 years ago to almost 20% of all such trials as of January 2012. Some of these important trials and their immune targets are highlighted in Table 62-4\n. One area that can serve as a barometer of the relevance of an experimental platform is HIV vaccine trials. As of January 2012, 11 phase 1 and 2 clinical trials sponsored by the HVTN are ongoing to assess the ability of DNA to elicit immune responses and ultimately prevent HIV infection, either alone or in combination with multiple viral vectors. One of the most prominent trials, HVTN 505, is a phase 2 study enrolling 2,200 subjects to test the safety and efficacy of a DNA vector prime followed by an adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) boost vaccination strategy developed by the VRC. Another important phase 2 study is being conducted by GeoVax through the HVTN to evaluate the efficacy of a DNA prime followed by a MVA virus boost.59 An alternative clinical approach uses a DNA prime to develop T-cell responses as well as to prime for B-cell immunity, followed by a recombinant protein boost to generate more-potent antibody responses. Preliminary data from these studies are encouraging. An important HIV study of a stand-alone DNA product is being tested under protocol HVTN 080. This study of multiply optimized DNA plus an IL-12 adjuvant is testing a particular formulation (Pennvax) of DNA. Preliminary data from this study have shown clear induction of T-cell immunity in the absence of a viral vector boost. It will be important to see if the trend showing improved immune responses in the clinic induced by EP strategies continues, which would expand the applications of the DNA platform.",

Although both cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to anti-Ad5 immunity, it is likely that the Ad5 neutralizing antibodies play a major role in suppressing rAd5-induced immunogenicity, and such immune responses have been observed in humans. This preexisting immunity can reduce the immunogenicity of Ad vaccines in mice,164\n,\n165 rhesus monkeys,166 and potentially in humans,167\n,\n168 but it is not clear that preexisting immunity in humans will completely block vaccine immunogenicity.

Finally, the administration of Ad5 vectors through mucosal routes may help to circumvent this problem.169 However, the safety of this approach, particularly for intranasal delivery, has yet to be determined.170 In addition, several investigators have explored the possibility of coating rAd5 particles with chemicals such as polyethylene glycol, which may block access of antibodies to the viral surface.",

A variety of chimeric fiber or hexon proteins have been described that maintain immunogenicity and can evade neutralizing antibodies, both against the fiber,171, 172, 173, 174 or through the use of hexon chimeras, which appear to be the targets of the major neutralizing antibody response.175\n,\n176 Another approach to antivector immunity involves the development of novel vectors from alternative serotypes. To develop such vectors, investigators have evaluated rAd vectors from low-seroprevalence human adenoviruses, as well as from nonhuman primates. Recombinant Ad vectors from human serotypes have been well described.177, 178, 179 Seroprevalence of the 51 Ad serotypes suggests that the Ad11 and Ad35 subfamilies as well as adenoviruses from subfamily D, including Ad26, are uncommon in humans180 and may therefore offer advantages over Ad5 as vectors. Novel vectors based on rAd35 and rAd11 have been developed, and preclinical studies suggest that they are resistant to anti-Ad5 immunity in mice.48\n,\n181 The usefulness of these vectors has been compared with rAd5. Although some of the alternative vectors show less seropositivity, they are often also less immunogenic in preclinical animal studies. There also appear to be regional differences in seropositivity to diverse \u201crare\u201d serotype rAd vectors. For example, although the rAd26 and rAd28 B serotypes have shown promise in early clinical trials and their seroprevalence is low in North America, seropositivity to these viruses approaches 80% in parts of Africa,182\n,\n183 complicating development and regulatory issues for such vectors.",

Whether the frequency of preexisting Ad5 immunity may compromise their usefulness in humans remains to be determined; however, a variety of strategies are under development to overcome this effect should it be found.

Alternative serotypes, including AAV1, are currently under development and may be assessed both alone and in prime-boost combinations for efficacy in humans.

Of the viruses developed for such vaccines, representative members, summarized in Figure 62-1B, include recombinant Ad, poxviruses, measles, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and AAV, all of which have progressed into human trials. The development of transformed and continuously propagatable cell lines, in contrast to the previous standard, avian leucosis\u2013free primary CEFs, represents a major advance in vaccine production technology, largely because these cell lines facilitate the production of replication-defective viral vectors in stably transfected cell lines. Such lines also offer potentially improved yields and stable production capacity. The development of these lines has taken years to implement because of regulatory concerns regarding adventitious agents, tumorigenicity, and other safety and consistency considerations. Oversight and evaluation of the strengths and limitations of these cell substrates continues,252 based on guidelines created several years ago,253\n,\n254 with an increasing number of such lines becoming better characterized and available.",

A variety of bacteria are able to replicate at mucosal sites of natural infection, and it has been proposed that attenuation of these microorganisms and modification to facilitate the delivery of antigen might allow the development of improved vaccines to protect against pathogens that enter through the mucosa. Development of live bacterial vectors has therefore focused both on their ability to induce mucosal IgA responses and on cytolytic T-cell responses at mucosal sites. The delivery of antigens into mammalian cells to stimulate antibody responses does not require the types of novel gene-based vaccines summarized in this chapter. On the other hand, the synthesis of proteins in mammalian cells delivered by bacterial vectors has the potential to induce the cellular immunity that is the goal of many gene-based viral and nonviral vaccines. These approaches have been reviewed in detail elsewhere255, 256, 257 and are summarized briefly here.",

In addition, there are commensal strains such as Streptococcus gordonii, lactobacilli, and staphylococci that have been used for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. For gene-based vaccination, L. monocytogenes has been a particular focus of research. This gram-positive intracellular pathogen has been studied as a model for understanding class I MHC-restricted immune responses. These responses are normally seen against the bacterial proteins or coexpressed antigens. This microorganism uses a specialized system to introduce proteins into cells and facilitate processing and presentation through MHC class I, and different mutations have been used to develop attenuated strains that retain the ability to deliver antigens. Similarly, Salmonella bacterial strains are intracellular pathogens that become restricted to the endosomal compartment of eukaryotic cells, where they are resistant to lysis.258 A variety of mutations have been introduced into Salmonella to generate several different live vaccine carriers, and these vaccine prototypes have undergone further development for vaccine delivery. Among the other bacterial carriers, M. bovis Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) has been a widely used bacterial vaccine; for example, this organism has been used to express HIV antigens.259\n,\n260 In some instances, expression of mammalian genes has required modification of codons more consistent with the host cell type, which has improved immunogenicity.

Among the concerns is the possibility of reversion or reactogenicity of these potentially pathogenic bacteria to wild type forms, the stability of the recombinant bacteria, and the possibility that preexisting immunity from exposure to natural pathogens may limit their infectivity. A variety of host genetic factors can modulate the immune response induced by the bacterial carrier, and variability in the innate immune responses to such pathogens may limit their consistency in vivo. Finally, perhaps the most challenging problem has been the ability to effect a gene transfer from bacteria into mammalian cells. It is likely that very specialized transport pathways are required for the successful implementation of this technology, and additional improvements will be necessary to improve the efficacy of this approach, which remains limited in its present form.",
