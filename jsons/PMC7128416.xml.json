            "text": "In terms of emerging diseases, an interesting outlook was presented by Paul Kellam (University College of London; http://www.ucl.ac.uk). Kellam stated that as a result of the continuing improvement in molecular and biochemical technologies, the number of viruses and associated infections that can be detected is constantly increasing, as illustrated by the recent SARS outbreak. SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was unambiguously identified in November 2002. In April 2003, the link between SARS-CoV and the disease was established, and in May 2003 the full genome was sequenced. Meanwhile, Pfizer (http://www.pfizer.com/main.html) launched a drug development program on the SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Wade Blair (Pfizer) reported on anti-SARS-CoV compounds that show activity in an in vitro retroviral assay. Pfizer pursued homology modeling of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease, based on the human rhinovirus 3C protease (HRV-2 3C protease) crystal structure, and their current lead out of this program is AG7122, which shows efficacy in a cellular replication model.",

            "text": "Patrick Iversen from AVI Biopharma (http://www.avibio.com/home.html) reported on a different development strategy for treating SARS that exploits antisense therapy. AVI Biopharma uses antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), which are uncharged and stable, to target c-myc (AVI4126) and CYP3A4 (AVI4557) in cancer. The company currently has nine ongoing clinical studies researching the efficacy of using PMOs in the treatment of cancer. To date, they have not observed any serious adverse side effects in any of the 250 patients participating in the clinical studies. AVI-Biopharma decided to apply PMO technology to the field of antivirals and translated it into an extremely promising research program. Furthermore, Iversen reported a record time of nine months for the progression of the PMO AVI4020 (used in the treatment of WNV) from concept to Phase Ib clinical trials. Similarly, the activity of various PMOs against several other flavivirus models (e.g. Dengue-2 and hepatitis C) was observed. In summary, PMOs are a safe, effective and rapid novel antisense technology that show promise for antiviral therapy. However, one potential disadvantage with the use of PMO therapeutic agents is the route of administration; problems have been encountered with the oral administration of PMOs.",

The development of novel nucleoside analogs remains an attractive prospect for the future of antiviral drug discovery for the following reasons: administered orally; 50 years of experience in nucleoside chemistry; a well defined pharmacology and mechanism of action; ease of production; low protein binding; potentially low drug\u2013drug interaction; a high probability of regulatory approval; and low development costs. However, Ken Powell (Arrow Therapeutics) raised several clear counterarguments: a need for highly trained nucleoside chemists; a clearly defined toxicology [3]; and the potential of viruses to develop resistance.",

NNRTIs act by inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase. The binding of NNRTIs to HIV reverse transcriptase induces a conformational change in the enzyme, which subsequently introduces steric effects that inhibit the mode of action of HIV reverse transcriptase. On this basis, the third generation of NNRTIs (e.g. TMC125 and GW8248) has been successfully developed.",

Kaletra is well tolerated and exhibits significant antiviral effects in single and multiple PI-experienced patients. Molla reported that although Kaletra has a greater activity than the PI Atazanavir (Reyataz\u2122; Bristol\u2013Myers Squibb), studies indicate that Atazanavir is likely to become the largest competitor of Kaletra in the HIV drug market because of the once-daily administration of Atazanavir (which is unique amongst the PIs) and the low level of lipid-related side effects (as compared with the other five marketed PIs [4]) associated with the drug.",

The most promising compound appears to be a CCR5 antagonist, the spirodiketopiperazine derivative, GW873140 (also known as AK602 and ONO4128), which commenced Phase I clinical trials in July 2003. In addition, Koszalka summarized research performed on inhibitors of the glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. Roche recently launched (March 2002) Fuzeon\u2122 (T20) (Trimeris), a peptide drug that acts by blocking the HR1\u2013HR2 domain interaction of gp41. Fuzeon returns the CD4 T-cell counts in patients to almost 100 cells/mm3, which is a \u2018magic number\u2019 for clinicians because treatment with orally administered therapies can be resumed. However, Koszalka advised that Fuzeon should be employed as early in therapy as patients are able to tolerate because of the side effect of adverse reactions occurring at the injection site (e.g. itching and swelling), which is exacerbated by the administration of twice-daily injections, and leads to a discontinuation rate in 4% of the treated patients. A second-generation fusion inhibitor currently under development (T1249) shows in vitro activity against Fuzeon-resistant viruses.",

In early 2003, BILN2061 was the most promising candidate for the next generation of hepatitis C drugs. The final structure of BILN2061 was optimized from co-crystallization studies of a peptide-like lead structure and is the result of a challenging peptidomimetics approach. BILN2061 has potent activity in vitro (in the replicon system), but it is not bioavailable in chimpanzees. In a Phase I trial, BILN2061 demonstrated potent activity and a viral drop of three logs after a two-day treatment. However, routine chronic safety testing of high, supra-therapeutic doses in animals identified adverse reactions to the drug. Boehringer Ingelheim is currently studying the available preclinical data to determine their impact on the clinical development of this compound.",

The gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase (GI-GPx) is specifically downregulated in HCV replicon cells. Validation experiments using the replicon system revealed that ectopic overexpression of GI-GPx leads to the inhibition of RNA replication. The GI-GPx promoter contains retinoid acid response elements, and addition of retinoid acid and its derivatives to the replicon system results in inhibition of the GI-GPx promoter. Therefore, retinoid acid (a market drug for acne) could provide an alternative medical therapy for treating hepatitis C, particularly for IFN-\u03b1 non-responders.",
