In this context, there have been federal and state-level policy interventions aiming at mitigating the public health risks of this pandemic. These social distancing and work-from-home policies, which vary widely across states, have impacted the electricity sector, and economic productivity in general. As the U.S. begins to gradually resume some economic and social activities, it is imperative for policy makers and electric power operators to take a data-driven scientific approach to understanding and predicting the change of electricity consumption in the shorter and longer term. In this paper, we release a first-of-its-kind open access data hub, namely the Coronavirus Disease-Electricity",

The load analysis released by the ISO Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) 12 based on a backcast model estimated a reduction of a 4 \u2212 5% both daily peak and weekly energy use while loads remained consistently low during the early morning hours. A similar methodology was implemented by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) 13 , finding an almost 10% reduction of both daily and weekly loads. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), incorporating the normalization of weather factors, observed delayed load peaks in the morning and up to a 16% load reduction in the zones with large commercial energy use 14 .",

Firstly, the lack of consistent assessment criteria renders results across distinct geographical locations incomparable. Secondly, existing statistical analysis does not rigorously calibrate a baseline forecast in the absence of the pandemic, so that the impact of the pandemic may be quantified against this benchmark with confidence. Therefore, a well-calibrated, rigorous and comprehensive assessment that can be standardized across different locations and datasets is required to facilitate informed decision-making in the electricity sector in the coming months.",

We pay special attention to the impact of COVID-19 on electricity markets in the U.S. 16 for two reasons. Subject to strict requirements of information disclosure, electricity market data are usually timely, accurate, abundant and publicly available in the U.S., making the market dataset ideal for impacts tracking and measurement. More importantly, existing marketplaces in U.S. are well correlated with specific pandemic hotspot areas. Fig. 1 shows the number of confirmed COVID-19 as of April 24, 2020 at both the state level (heat map zones) 17 and electricity marketplace level (shaded zones) 16 . Focusing on the states in dark brown (with over 100, 000 confirmed cases), the majority are properly covered by the seven existing U.S. electricity markets, except for Florida, Georgia, Washington and Colorado states. Further statistical results indicate that these marketplaces cover the top seven hardest-hit states, and more than 83% of the national number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.",

All these markets share the similar structure, so it is possible to collect and arrange data to support cross-market analysis. In this paper, we mainly focus on the load, generation mix and day-ahead locational marginal price (LMP). Although these markets have established websites for public information disclosure, their download centers, database structures and user interfaces differ widely. Further, file formats, definitions, historical data availability and documentations are also extremely diverse across these markets, making it difficult to integrate this data into a unified framework.

In the social distancing metric dataset, \"home\" is defined as the location of users at midnight, and \"full-time workplace\" is defined as the non-home location at which users spend more than 6 hours during daytime. We aggregate the original social distancing dataset by county and define the social distancing level as the estimated proportion of users who stay at home all day. Fig. 2 shows the change of the social distancing level in each county of the U.S. mainland from March 11 to April 08, 2020, with February 12 being the baseline. Note that we specially select these Wednesdays to reflect the impacts of work-from-home policies. From Fig. 2 , a significant increase in the social distancing level indicates the change of people's social behavior amidst the pandemic, with regional differences based on stringency and effectiveness of stay-at-home policies. The pattern dataset mainly contains (i) base information of POIs of 168 categories, including location name, address and brand association, and (ii) information of daily visits and dwell time in POIs. We aggregate the original data by county and POI category. Specifically, Fig. 3 visualizes the change of visit patterns in four hotspot cities from February 15 to April 25, from which we can observe that (i) all cities suffered a sudden decline starting from March 15, the issuing date of the national emergency, and (ii) the extent of the declines have similar characteristics with some regional divergences.

We further provided the first assessment results with this data resource to quantify the intensity and dynamics of the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. electricity sector. Our results suggest that the U.S. electricity sector, in particular the Northeastern region, is undergoing highly voltatile changes. The change in the overall electricity consumption is also highly correlated with public health information such as newly added COVID-19 positive cases. Our analysis provides strong evidence that the power sector is experiencing a highly-influenced period, and some preparations are needed in advance to mitigate the impact of these significant changes on the operation of U.S. electricity markets. We also find very diverse levels of impact in different marketplaces, indicating that market-specific analysis is critically important. Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, immediate future work includes further in-depth analysis on the shorter and longer-term impact on the electricity sector, including cross-domain statistical models for predictive studies and policy evaluation.",

As for the specific implementations for existing electricity markets, we split the MISO market to three parts and SPP to two because these markets cover very broad areas and the weather observations can vary significantly within the market area. For each market (or part of a market), we formulated a basic backcast model by considering different input settings (combination of weather variables and calendar variables with various time lag), different prepossessing techniques (normalization) and different model architectures (neural networks with various configurations, support vector machine, random forest and polynomial regression). After comparing different models, a structure with a four-layer fully-connected neural network, ReLU activation function, and L2 regularization, trained by an early stopping rule shows the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. Afterwards, a random search of the hidden layer numbers within \u00b120% fluctuation in each layer, was implemented to generate a series of backcast models. We searched 500 models for each market (or part of market) and selected the top 100 according to their estimation accuracy.
