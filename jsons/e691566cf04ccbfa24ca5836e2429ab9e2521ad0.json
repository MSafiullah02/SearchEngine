Respiratory viral infections caused by sendai virus have been described by Ward et al.

In terms of hepatotropic virus infections, natural outbreaks of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection has been described by Sebesteny and Hill,4 Tamura et al.,' and Ward et aL6 Carthew' compared the histopathology and pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis type 1 virus induced experimentally in the nude mouse, with that of field cases observed in the United Kingdom and concluded that they were similar. They were also indistinguishable from the natural infections described in Japan. ' As no other experimental studies in nude mice have been recorded for other strains of mouse hepatitis virus (Types S, A59,3) it would seem that the differentiation of these infections would have to rely upon neutralization typing of virus isolations with antiserum produced against these strains, which is not a common procedure, due to the extensive serological cross-reactions between the strains of MHV. However, it is relatively simple to prepare histological sections of livers from nude mice exhibiting hepatic lesions, and it would be advantageous if the different strains of hepatitis virus could be distinguished by a combination of information on the virulence of a strain of virus and the histopathological appearance of the liver lesions. To determine whether this is possible, the pathogenesis of three strains of mouse hepatitis virus (1, A59 and S) was compared in nude mice. The histopathological appearance of the lesions relative to two other common murine hepatotropic viruses, as yet undocumented in nude mice, is also described.",

The maximum time that any of these mice survived was 3 weeks. The histopathology produced by this strain was much more typical of a chronic infection in the liver. Focal necrotic lesions were observed within 3 days of infection but unlike type A59 they did not expand and coalesce. They enlarged slowly and characteristic multinucleate giant cells (syncytia) were associated with the lesions (Fig. 2) . Because the lesions progressed slowly there was an infiltrative response of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. After 10 days fibrosis was present associated with necrosis and many giant cells (some with pyknotic nuclei) (Fig. 3) .",

The necrotic foci were quite distinctive; they were sharply delineated with a small margin of leucocytic cells around their edge, but not a great deal of fibrotic replacement of the parenchymal cells destroyed, giving the liver sections a 'holey' appearance (Fig. 6) .
