            "text": "All vascular plant species were listed on eight sites near Sydney, Australia. Four sites were on infertile and four on fertile soil. Each of the 335 species was classified according to seed mass (measured as fresh mass of embryo plus endosperm), morphological adaptations for dispersal by different vectors, and growth form. The infertile-soil sites had more species and more cover adapted for dispersal by ants, and the fertile-soil sites had more species and more cover with fleshy fruits adapted for dispersal by vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that this difference could be interpreted as a secondary correlate of seed size or of growth form. Species with smaller seed mass or growing to <2 m tall were significantly more likely to be adapted for dispersal by ants relative to vertebrates. An indirect association via growth form was capable of accounting for up to 84% of the relationship between soil type and dispersal mode, an indirect association via seed mass for up to 23% of the relationship; the two together could account for a maximum of 85%. The indirect association via seed mass was relatively weaker because seed masses proved not to be very different between these soil types. There remained a significant residual t~ndency for species in any gi:ven seed size class and growth form to be more likely to be dispersed by vertebrates relative to ants on fertile soils than on infertile soils.",

The diaspores are carried by ants to their nests, the food body is removed and eaten, and the discarded seed can subsequently germinate. This dispersal adaptation is much more important on infertile than on fertile soils. This is most apparent in Australia (Berg 1975 , Rice and Westoby 1981 , Westoby et al. 1982 and southern Africa (Milewski 1982, Milewski and Bond 1982) , where the two largest known concentrations of ant-dispersed species are found. In these two areas ant dispersal is concentrated in sclerophyll species, which characteristically occur on low-nutrient soils. However, few ant-dispersed species have been reported in the sclerophyll vegetation of California (Berg 1966 , Bullock 1974 or around the Mediterranean (Semander 1906 , Muller 1933 , which indicates the association is with low soil nutrients rather than with sclerophylly as such.",

There is much evidence that ant nests can be chemically different from background soils (Davidson and Morton 1981 , Beattie 1985 , and some evidence that seedlings grow better for this reason Beattie 1980, Beattie 1983 ). However, Horvitz and Schemske (1986) found seedlings did not grow better in ant-nest soil, and in Australian sclerophyll vegetation where large percentages of species are ant dispersed, direct tests have not found that ant-dispersed seeds reach nutrient-enriched microsites (Majer 1982, Rice and Westoby 1986) .",

For example, diaspore size in sclerophyll vegetation might be concentrated, for reasons presumably to do with seedling establishment, in a size range which coincidentally is suited to dispersal by ants. Seeds' prospects of establishment are strongly influenced by the reserves of energy or mineral nutrient on which they can initially rely (Janzen 1969 , Harper et al. 1970 , Harper 1977 , Grime 1979 , Willson 1983 , Foster 1986 ). Differences in mean seed mass between environments are thought to reflect the different problems posed for seedling establishment (Salisbury 1942 , Harper et al. 1970 , Baker 1972 . Different seed sizes obviously tend to favor different seed dispersal methods. So it might be that lower-nutrient soils favor seed sizes in a range that in tum favors dispersal by ants. By an argument of the same form, low-nutrient soils might favor plant growth forms that in tum favor seed dispersal by ants.",

We listed species on replicate fertile-soil and infertile-soil sites, and classified their diaspores according to dispersal morphology and according to size, and the plants themselves into growth form categories. (We dissected diaspores and weighed embryo plus endosperm, because this mass clearly represented part of the \"problem\" that had to be solved by a dispersal mode, while flesh, wings, hairs, etc. could be regarded as part of the dispersal \"solution\" adopted over evolutionary time.) The result was a four-dimensional contingency table, site type x diaspore mass x dispersal mode x growth form. If species in a given growth form and diaspore mass category proved equally likely to be ant dispersed, irrespective of whether they were on fertile or on infertile soils, this would have been consistent with the secondary correlate hypothesis. METHODS We selected eight sites in national parks or state forests around the northern and southern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, ~ 34o S, 151 o E. Substantial areas of natural vegetation on infertile sandstone are conserved around Sydney, but most fertile soils were cleared quite early during European colonization. Only small patches of fertile-soil vegetation remain, usually within large areas of infertile Hawkesbury Sandstone. We were able to distribute our four fertile sites over three substrate types. Sites on infertile soil were then chosen to be interspersed with the fertile sites ( Fig. 1 ), and to include both woodland and heathland vegetation, even though Rice and Westoby (1981) had found no evidence vegetation structure affected the incidence of dispersal by ants among infertile-soil vegetation types.",

The general types of structure associated with different dispersal syndromes are well known (van der Pijl 1982), and we made our initial attribution on this basis. We then carried out the following tests. Structures thought to increase air resistance (wings, hairs) had to slow the rate of fall of a propagule relative to another that had had the same structures removed. The two were dropped together from a height. For a propagule to be classified as ballistically dispersed, there had to be a distinct structure in which forces were generated as the fruit matured, leading eventually to explosive propulsion. We chose not to classify as ballistic quite a large group of species with censer dispersal, whose seeds tend to be thrown from their fruit when branches whip in the wind. We made this decision because it would have been very difficult to set objective limits to such a category. Propagules thought to be adapted to attach externally to animals (exozoochores) had to stick to a piece of woven cotton cloth.",

However, species with the typical fleshy fruit syndrome for vertebrates (moist flesh, usually changing color at maturity) were not treated as adapted for ant dispersal even though ants often would attempt to move them in the event that they reached the ground without previously being taken by a vertebrate. We felt that the syndrome was clearly better adapted to vertebrates than to ants. Species with large, coiled, colored arils were also treated as adapted for vertebrate rather than ant dispersal (O'Dowd and Gill 1986). A few species had the typical fleshy fruit syndrome, but we had some reason to believe they are also adapted to be dispersed by ants. We have treated these species as having a combination of the two dispersal adaptations.

At least five diaspores were weighed for each species, spread over plants and sites if possible. Fleshy fruits were weighed fresh promptly, after storing refrigerated for a few days, or after storing frozen in sealed containers for a longer period. They were subsequently dried at 80\u00b0C and weighed again. Another fresh diaspore was chosen from the midrange of sizes indicated by the weighings and was dissected into three components: embryo plus endosperm; \"dispersal structure,\" meaning any wing, food body, etc.; and the remainder, including the testa and other tissues surrounding embryo and endosperm. These three components were weighed both fresh and dry to estimate the percentage each contributed to a typical diaspore. In many cases > 1 diaspore was dissected quantitatively, and in all cases further diaspores were cut apart to confirm that the one dissected quantitatively was not atypical internally. In the case of berries, aggregate fruits, and drupaceous fruits, with several seeds included within one body of flesh, the seeds in each of five diaspores were counted. The amount of flesh can therefore be expressed either on a per-diaspore or on a per-embryo basis. Measurements of mass were made using a Cahn microbalance to microgram precision. In the case of orchid seeds and fern spores it was not possible to weigh or dissect individuals, and an average mass for whole diaspores was obtained from weighing a group. 3 Species were classed into four growth form categories working from Beadle et al. ( 1972) , supplemented by personal knowledge. The four categories into which it was possible to divide species were: herbaceous species plus low or scrambling shrubs <50 em tall; shrubs from 50 to 200 em tall; tall shrubs > 200 em, small trees, and trees; climbers, vines, and twiners.

The effect ofSD added after SM, MD was to reduce G 2 by 31.19, 77% as much as when SD was added first. Thus, an indirect relationship via seed mass might account for as much as 23% of the SD association. The indirect relationship via seed mass was comparatively weak, even though dispersal mode was strongly related to seed mass (Fig. 4 ) , because seed mass proved not to be strongly differentiated between these soil types (marginal association SM, G 2 = 9.97, partial association SM, G 2 = 0.05; Table 4 ).

Species having structures giving air resistance, or with no special morphological adaptations at all, were about equally common in relation to soil fertility. Thus any adaptive interpretation as to why dispersal by ants should be particularly favored on infertile soils needs to compare dispersal by ants with dispersal by vertebrates. This finding was possible because we obtained complete dispersal spectra instead of focusing on the incidence of a single dispersal type, as has usually been done in previous work (e.g., Rice and Westoby 1981 , Sorensen 1986 , Willson 1986 ).",

In this comparison the association between seed mass and dispersal mode mainly explained variation within rather than between vegetation types. However, seed mass is known to vary among some vegetation types. Shaping of dispersal mode by embryo-plus-endosperm mass might be responsible for quite a large proportion of the variation in dispersal spectra among different vegetation types around the world. For example, the large percentage of woody plants in tropical moist forests that have vertebrate-dispersed fruits (Gentry 1982 , Tanner 1982 could result from strong selection for large embryo plus endosperms, rather than from the distances and placement achieved by vertebrate dispersers. Generally, it will be helpful to account for embryo-plus-endosperm size when considering the Ecology, Vol. 71, No.4 adaptive merits of different dispersal modes in different environments.",
