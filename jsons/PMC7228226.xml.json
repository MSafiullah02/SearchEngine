However, from the details given in the report, there are doubts that this patient is living with HIV, and additional information would be needed to confirm it. In addition, the antiretroviral drug treatment mentioned is not within the standard guidelines for someone infected with HIV.",

In this case report, the authors describe a 61\u2010year\u2010old male, who was a heavy smoker with type II diabetes. He presented with recurrent fever and dry cough and was diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia on a chest computed tomography scan. There is no other demographic information given in the case report, but he does not appear to fall into traditional HIV infection risk groups. There is no information on sexual history, drug use, or blood transfusion, which would assist in evaluating his HIV risk. The authors then mention \u201can antigen/antibody combination test on blood gave the HIV\u2010positive result,\u201d without discussion of why the test was given, nor what the test was, or if it was repeated more than once. There is no mention of an HIV viral load measurement, or any subsequent follow up for confirmation of his HIV diagnosis. They then say the patient was put on \u201coral therapy with an anti\u2010HIV drug, lopinavir/ritonavir\u201d for 12 days. This is not an adequate regimen for someone diagnosed with HIV.",
