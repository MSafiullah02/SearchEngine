However, if inflammation is not limited and becomes generalized, it can result in the constellation of signs and symptoms of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). If the infection is not contained, the spread of the pathogen from its local origin through the blood may result in systemic endothelial activation and precipitate sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Progression of sepsis to shock may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and ultimately death.",

Innate immunity is rapid, largely nonspecific, and composed of barriers, phagocytic cells, the complement system, and other soluble components of inflammation. After breech of a barrier, cellular elements of the innate immune response are the first line of defense against the development and progression of infection. Adaptive immunity, which is antigen specific, is long lived, and often takes several days to develop, provides immunologic specificity and memory. These systems work together to protect the host from pathogenic challenge but may also precipitate host injury through aberrant responses. The outcome of infection is dependent on at least four major factors: (1) the pathogen, (2) the pathogen load, (3) the site of infection, and (4) the host response. Less is known about the host response in neonates compared with adults for a number of reasons, the principal one being a highly variable definition of disease.",

There is clear evidence from both preclinical models of sepsis and humans that neonates manifest different host immune responses as compared with adults.1, 2, 3, 4 Even in comparison with children, neonates manifest a unique host immune response to septic shock.5 Thus neonatal-specific clinical investigations, particularly in very preterm infants, are required to improve both survival and long-term outcomes for these pop\u00adulations. A better understanding of the pathophysiology will uncover new opportunities for interventional studies ultimately aimed at improving outcomes. To this end, in this chapter we explore the pathophysiology of sepsis in the neonate, with special attention paid to the immunobiology of sepsis.",

The generally accepted pediatric definition for sepsis, established in 2005, was intended for all children (<18 years old), including term neonates (\u226537 weeks' completed gestation).6 Preterm neonates (<37 weeks' completed gestation) were specifically excluded from the pediatric generally accepted definitions, and neonatal-perinatal subspecialists were not represented among the pediatric consensus experts. To investigate whether the pediatric generally accepted definitions for SIRS and sepsis applied to term infants, Hofer and colleagues10 retrospectively examined 476 term neonates and found that the generally accepted definitions applied to only 53% of cases of culture-positive early-onset sepsis. Neonatal sepsis has been inconsistently defined on the basis of a variety of clinical and laboratory criteria, which makes the study of this condition very difficult.11 Diagnostic challenges and uncertain disease epidemiology necessarily result from a variable definition of disease. The lack of a generally accepted definition for neonatal sepsis remains a significant hindrance towards improving outcomes and accurately describing disease pathophysiology. Thus working definitions for the sepsis continuum, specific for preterm and term neonates, are needed to provide a uniform basis for clinicians and researchers to study and diagnose severe sepsis. The addition of immune biomarker\u2013based staging of disease to clinical sign staging is highly likely to increase the accuracy of patient classification for future multicenter clinical trials that will test novel interventions.",

            "text": "A number of pathogens have been associated with sepsis in the neonatal period. The predominant cause is bacterial; however, certain viral infections are associated with a fulminant course and significant mortality.50, 51, 52 In a large (n = 104,676), multicenter study of VLBW infants (<1500 g), gram-positive organisms accounted for 34% of pathogens causing early-onset sepsis and 61% of those causing late-onset sepsis. In contrast, gram-negative organisms were responsible for 58% of early-onset sepsis and 26% of late-onset sepsis.53\nCandida species accounted for 3% of cases of early-onset sepsis and 11% of cases of late-onset sepsis. Infection by gram-negative organisms, particularly Pseudomonas species, carries a higher risk for fulminant course and death than infection by other pathogen groups.14, 15, 49, 54, 55, 56 Gram-positive causes of sepsis are dominated by GBS and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS).15, 57 Although the high mortality rate for GBS has been well described (especially among infants born prematurely), mortality rates associated with CoNS are significantly lower.15, 16 Fungi may also be associated with fulminant neonatal sepsis and predominantly affect VLBW infants.15, 58, 59 Independent predictors of in-hospital neonatal mortality after late-onset sepsis were Pseudomonas infection (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 14.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.87% to 53.0%) and fungemia (OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 2.48% to 13.01%).60 The limited sensitivity of current methods to identify causative organisms is partially due to an inability to take a large sample of blood from newborn infants with suspected sepsis.61 Blood culture\u2013negative (\u201cclinical\u201d) sepsis is estimated to occur at a nearly 10-fold greater rate than blood culture\u2013positive sepsis.62 In some of these infants, sepsis may also be due to novel viral pathogens associated with sepsis-like syndromes (e.g., echovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, Coxsackie virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus).50, 63, 64, 65\n",

Multiple immune elements are present to prevent attachment and propagation of pathogens while simultaneously permitting the presence of commensal organisms required for homeostasis. Vernix enhances skin barrier function in late-preterm and term neonates. Vernix is a complex material comprising water (80.5%), lipids (10.3%), and proteins (9.1%) produced by fetal sebaceous glands during the last trimester66 and is largely absent in preterm neonates born before 28 weeks' gestation. Vernix provides a barrier to water loss, improves temperature control, and serves as a shield containing antioxidants and innate immune factors such as antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs).67 The APPs on the surface of the newborn's skin (and replete in the amniotic fluid68, 69, 70) are capable of killing/inactivating common neonatal pathogens, including GBS, E. coli, and Candida species.71 Erythema toxicum is an immune-mediated manifestation that results from bacterial colonization of the skin occurring shortly after birth.72, 73 This common cutaneous immune response is less common in preterm infants than in term infants, highlighting the impact of developmental age on host immune capabilities.74 In contrast to the moist mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, the skin is arid, which further reduces the chances for microbial invasion.",

Interleukin (IL)-17, produced by type 3 intestinal innate lymphoid cells in the presence of the microbiota, drives granulocytosis and may protect the neonatal host from infectious challenge.83 A loss of intestinal barrier integrity likely plays a role in the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis.84, 85 Prolonged antibiotic treatment, hypoxia, and remote infection are factors known to disrupt or injure the neonatal intestinal barrier (see Figure 152-2).86, 87, 88 Under these circumstances, the gut may become the motor of systemic inflammation.89 Mechanistically, Paneth cells and intestinal lymphoid cells may release excessive amounts of IL-17, which, in turn, plays a critical role in the development of SIRS.90 Many interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of sepsis in neonates via enhancement of mucosal barrier integrity have been evaluated.

The surface and submucosal gland epithelium of the conducting airways is a constitutive primary participant in innate immunity through the production of mucus and mucociliary clearance of pathogens and debris.95 Premature neonates have relatively more goblet cells than do maturer neonates, leading to a decrease in mucociliary clearance. Respiratory mucosal function can be impaired by surfactant and saliva deficiency, altered mucus production, and mechanical ventilation. Ventilation is associated with decreased mucociliary clearance, airway irritation, and parenchymal lung injury (see Figure 152-2). Intubation is also associated with the progressive accumulation of colonizing bacteria and bacterial endotoxin in respiratory fluids, with concomitant mobilization of endotoxin-modulating APPs to the airway.96 Neonates with surfactant deficiency lack APPs such as surfactant proteins A and D, which are also absent in commercially available surfactant preparations.97 There is an age-dependent maturation in the ability of respiratory epithelium to elaborate APPs (cathelicidin and \u03b2-defensins), such that the respiratory epithelium of preterm newborns mounts a deficient APP response.98 These deficiencies as well as those related to cellular function in combination with invasive procedures lead to a reduction in respiratory barrier function that increases the risk for sepsis.",

Multiple classes of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) have been discovered that serve as detectors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including cell wall and membrane components, flagellum, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates.99 A litany of PRR classes have been discovered, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid\u2013inducible protein I like receptors (RLRs), peptidoglycan recognition proteins, \u03b22-integrins, and C-type lectin receptors. The TLRs, \u03b22-integrins, and C-type lectin receptors detect pathogens both on the cell surface and in endosomes, whereas RLRs and NLRs detect pathogens only intracellularly. The discovery that TLR4 was integral for a robust lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response after gram-negative sepsis may be why TLRs have been more thoroughly investigated in the setting of sepsis than other PRRs.100 Each of the 10 known TLRs in humans, present on and within multiple cell types, recognizes extracellular and intracellular pathogens via specific PAMPs.101, 102 Multiple TLRs may be activated in concert by intact or partial microorganisms and in turn activate multiple second-messenger pathways simultaneously.102, 103\n",

During sepsis and septic shock, multiple proinflammatory cytokines have been identified, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-12, IL-18, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1.127 Compared with adults with sepsis, neonates with sepsis produce less IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12.128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133 The decreased cytokine production is due in part to decreased production of important intracellular mediators of TLR signaling, including myeloid differentiation factor 88, IFN regulatory factor 5, and p38, which exhibit gestational age\u2013specific decrements.134 Recent studies have demonstrated impaired inflammasome activation and mature IL-1\u03b2 production by neonatal mononuclear cells.121, 135 In a comprehensive study (>140 analytes) of serum from neonates evaluated for late-onset sepsis, IL-18 emerged as a predictive biomarker to differentiate infected neonates from uninfected neonates.136 IL-18 reduces PMN apoptosis,137 drives IFN-\u03b3 production,138 and induces production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and CXCL8.139 IL-18 primes PMNs for degranulation with production of reactive oxygen intermediates on subsequent stimulation.140 Dysregulation of many of these functions linked to IL-18 are seen in sepsis and septic shock. Increased IL-18 levels have been demonstrated in premature neonates with brain injury141 and also in an experimental model of NEC,142, 143, 144 highlighting activation pathways common with those in ischemia and inflammation. Excessive levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, and IL-18, such as those seen with advanced-stage NEC, severe sepsis, or septic shock, correlate with poor survival.84, 145, 146, 147, 148 Altered cytokine levels (increased IL-10 and IL-6 levels and decreased CCL5 levels) may identify those neonates at highest risk for the development of sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).149\n",

Without adequate leukocyte recruitment, there is increased risk for propagation from a localized to a systemic infection. Although poor cellular chemotaxis in the neonate has been observed, it is not likely a result of reduced serum concentrations of chemokines as baseline levels are similar in preterm and term neonates as compared with adults.154 Suboptimal cellular chemotaxis may be related to other mechanisms, such as poor complement receptor up-regulation after stimulation,99 deficiencies in another downstream signaling process,155 or inhibition by bacterial products.156 The levels of a wide variety of chemokines are increased during sepsis, including CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1), and CXCL8.157 The levels of other chemoattractive molecules also increase with sepsis, including complement proteins C3a and C5a, APPs, including cathelicidins and defensins, and components of invading bacteria themselves.127, 136 The importance of chemoattractive substances in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis is highlighted by studies showing that CXCL8 can be used as a stratifying factor for survival in children,158 and C5a is implicated in sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in adults.104 Chemokine investigations in infected neonates revealed that CXCL10 is a sensitive early marker of infection,157 and low CCL5 levels may predict development of DIC.149\n",

This paradigm has been challenged by the failure of multiple antiinflammatory strategies to improve sepsis outcomes in adults.185 New data in adults and children demonstrate simultaneous proinflammatory/antiinflammatory responses where the magnitude of either response may determine outcome.186, 187 Near simultaneous increases in antiinflammatory cytokine production (transforming growth factor \u03b2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13) occur in neonates during infection, countering the actions of proinflammatory cytokines.127, 188, 189 These mediators blunt the activation and recruitment of phagocytic cells, reduce fever, modify coagulation factor expression, and decrease production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, NO, and other vasoactive mediators.190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195\n",

Complement components also possess chemotactic or anaphylactic activity that increases leukocyte aggregation and local vascular permeability. Furthermore, complement reciprocally activates a number of other important processes, such as coagulation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and leukocyte activation.104 Contrary to its name, the alternative pathway is the primary mechanism of amplification of complement activation after C3 convertase assembly (which cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b). Dysregulation of complement activation may contribute to adverse effects in individuals with severe sepsis or septic shock. Neonates, particularly the very premature, exhibit decreased basal levels of complement proteins and function for both the alternative pathway and the classical pathway.253, 254 Moreover, as compared with adults, neonates exhibit gestational age\u2013related degrees of depressed complement-mediated opsonic capabilities.255 As such, complement-mediated opsonization is poor in premature neonates and limited in term neonates.255, 256\n",

As a result of a shorter period of gestation, preterm neonates have lower IgG subclass levels as compared with term neonates, particularly IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses.274 Preterm neonates (24 to 32 weeks' gestation) with low IgG levels (serum total IgG levels below 400 mg/dL at birth) were at increased risk for development of late-onset sepsis but not death compared to those with levels above 400 mg/dL. How\u00adever, IgG titers and opsonic activity to CoNS were not predictive of late-onset CoNS sepsis.275 Reliance on other means of innate immune defense likely provides the premature neonate with alternative microbial control mechanisms. Despite the presence of maternally derived immunoglobulin and acute-phase reactant proteins, neonates exhibit impaired opsonizing activity compared with adults, which likely increases the risk for progression of infection.276 Complement plays a critical role in immunoglobulin-mediated opsonization and effector cell phagocytosis.277 Although immunoglobulin has many putative beneficial immunologic functions, most of these have not been demonstrated or examined in preterm infants.278 The dependence on complement for effective immunoglobulin-based opsonization and pathogen clearance may help explain the lack of efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin to prevent sepsis or death from sepsis in neonates.279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285\n",

Present in nearly every organism, including bacteria, plants, insects, nonmammalian vertebrates, and mammals, these small, often cationic peptides are capable of killing microbes of multiple types, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi, largely by disruption of the pathogen membrane.286 Constitutive expression of APPs occurs in humans on barrier areas with consistent microbial exposure such as skin and mucosa. After microbial stimulation, both release of preformed APPs and inducible expression are thought to contribute to early host defense.287 Importantly, there is no evidence for the development of microbial resistance to APPs that target fundamental components of the microbial cell wall. Some APPs can bind and neutralize microbial components such as endotoxin, precluding engagement with TLRs and other PRRs, and diminish inflammation. Many APPs can potentially reduce the intensity of the inflammatory response associated with the presence of bacterial toxins.288, 289, 290 Because endotoxemia is an important contributor to neonatal MODS and death with sepsis and NEC,84 LPS-binding/blocking strategies, including use of synthetic APPs, may have a significant positive impact on outcomes.288, 291\n",

Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 inhibits fibrinolysis by inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn is important for the breakdown of fibrin. Deposition of fibrin in small vessels leads to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ failure.321 Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels are associated with increased IL-6, nitrite, and nitrate levels (metabolites of NO production), the development of organ failure, and increased mortality.321 Sepsis is associated with thrombocytopenia in neonates,322 which is attributed to reduced megakaryopoiesis in the setting of consumption with clot formation.323 Decreased platelet function in preterm neonates with sepsis further increases the risk for bleeding.324 In extremely low-birth-weight infants, platelets are hyporeactive for the first few days after birth, complicating the ability of the immune system to contain a microbiologic threat and increasing the risk for hemorrhage.325 Clotting can lead to propagation of inflammation via thrombin-induced production of platelet-activating factor. PMNs activated by platelet-activating factor or platelet TLR4 may then contribute to further endothelial injury and dysfunction, leading to the development of a vicious clotting-inflammation-clotting cycle. Activated platelets may be consumed in clot formation and/or may also be removed from the circulation by the liver,326 potentially resulting in thrombocytopenia, particularly during gram-negative and fungal infections.196, 322, 327\n",

In transgenic mice, it was shown that pulmonary endothelial cells sense blood-borne bacteria and their products,156 whereas alveolar macrophages patrol the air spaces.331 These data illustrate the role of endothelium and help to explain in part the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn associated with severe sepsis in the absence of a primary pulmonary infectious focus. Expression of TLRs allows endothelium to become activated in the presence of microbial components, leading to production of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules (e.g., vascular cell adhesion molecule, intercellular cell adhesion molecule, L-selectin, P-selectin, and E-selectin). These substances are all necessary to attract immune cells (primarily PMNs) to the site of infection and to facilitate pathogen containment.150, 151, 152, 153, 156 Vasoactive substances released from activated leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells include platelet-activating factor, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, NO, histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins.172, 173 The balance of NO and endothelin 1, a vasoconstrictor, may be disrupted with endothelial damage, favoring the constrictive effects of endothelin 1 and leading to ischemia and injury.175 This phenomenon may explain in part why NO inhibitors increased mortality in adults with septic shock.301 Stimulated endothelium can be a double-edged sword, however, because excessive activation can lead to systemic overproduction of cytokines and vasoactive substances (including NO). Endothelial cell apoptosis, detachment from the lamina, and alterations in vascular tone combine to pro\u00admote capillary leak, leading to hypovolemia, shock, and organ failure156, 302, 303 (see Figure 152-5). Release of myeloperoxidase from PMNs may also injure surrounding endothelium.332 Activated or damaged endothelium establishes a prothrombotic environment that can result in local microvascular occlusion314 or progress to DIC.333\n",

As a result, the neonate is thought to largely depend on innate immunity for protection from infection during the first days of life. In adults, absence or dysfunction of the adaptive immune system has a profound impact on survival in preclinical models.415 B cells (and in particular B-cell cytokine production) and not T cells were shown to be important in the early host response to experimental sepsis.416 Studies using neonatal mice lacking an adaptive immune system showed no difference in polymicrobial sepsis survival as compared with survival of wild-type mice with an intact adaptive immune system.3 Furthermore, there are many quantitative and qualitative differences in lymphocytes from neonates compared with lymphocytes from adults,417 each with a respective proposed clinical impact.87 As these findings illustrate, the contribution of adaptive immunity for protection and response against sepsis, and in particular which components are protective, is unclear in the most immature and requires further investigation.",

Neonates manifested the largest number of uniquely regulated genes, representing both innate and adaptive immune system pathways, and showed a predominance of down-regulated transcripts representing the adaptive immune system.5 The number of up-regulated genes increased in proportion with developmental age. Investigation of the murine circulating leukocyte transcriptome revealed significant differences in the host immune response to sepsis across the age spectrum (neonate, young adult, elderly), despite similar increases in mortality among the neonates and elderly mice as compared with young adult mice.1 These data underscore the impact of developmental age on the host immune response and suggest that therapeutics, which may have efficacy in older populations, may be ineffective in or possibly detrimental to neonates.",

However, a decrease in right or left ventricular output of more than 50% has been associated with increased mortality in neonatal sepsis.491 An elevated left ventricular output but normal ejection fraction in preterm neonates with septic shock suggests that septic shock in preterm neonates is predominantly due to vasoregulatory failure. Neonatal sepsis may or may not be associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; however, cardiac injury as manifested by elevated levels of cardiac troponin T may complicate the clinical picture.492, 493 Abnormal peripheral vasoregulation with or without myocardial dysfunction is the primary mechanism for the hypotension accompanying septic shock in the neonate.494 Therefore, infected neonates may present with hypotension and adequate perfusion (warm shock) or inadequate perfusion (cold shock).

A complete evaluation, including cultures of blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid, is uncommon,356 although one third of the cases of culture-positive meningitis in VLBW infants are associated with negative concurrent blood cultures.542 Clinically apparent seizures may occur in 25% of VLBW preterm infants with meningitis.542 Low-voltage background pattern, sleep-wake cycling, and seizure activity on the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram may be helpful to predict neurologic outcome in infants with sepsis or meningitis.543 Significantly lower resistance, vasodilatation, and higher blood flow were noted in all the cerebral arteries of infants with sepsis. Increase in cerebral blood flow velocity was correlated with elevated IL-6 concentrations.544 Alterations in blood flow in preterm infants, in addition to factors associated with sepsis, such as respiratory distress, hypercarbia, hypotension, and patent ductus arteriosus, contribute to the risk for intracerebral hemorrhage.",

Increased numbers of goblet cells (blue cells with inclusions) with decreased mucociliary clearance of the airway further increase the likelihood of infection (bacteria represented by purple spherical chains and blue/pink rods). B, Skin. Disruptions associated with trauma (venipuncture or heel stick), a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), a peripheral intravenous line (PIV), or tape-related abrasions compromise the skin barrier (bacteria represented by clusters of purple spheres and green rods). C, Gastrointestinal mucosa. Luminal bacteria (microbiota) are a valuable component of the mucosal barrier. The interaction between intestinal bacteria and intestinal epithelium is necessary for homeostasis and normal function of repair mechanisms. Disruption of this interaction, through the use of antibiotics or via stress to the organism (e.g., hypoxia or remote infection such as sepsis or pneumonia), results in loss of homeostasis and degradation of the intestinal boundaries with subsequent microbial translocation.",

Recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) occurs along the chemokine gradient surrounding the area of inflammation. Antiinflammatory cytokines counter the actions of proinflammatory cytokines to prevent excessive cellular activation and recruitment that can result in tissue damage and systemic inflammation.
