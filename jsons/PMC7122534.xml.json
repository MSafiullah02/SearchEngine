It shapes not only humanitarian assistance, but also military intervention and the pursuit of public health.\u2019 Due to this emergency imaginary, we feel that our social institutions, our health and well-being, and even, as in the case of global warming, the future of mankind as such are deeply endangered.",

Around the year 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) started collaborating with a large number of local actors and made a concentrated effort to protect the world\u2019s population against emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine flu, Ebola and Zika. Although efforts have been made so that the spread of future infectious diseases will be contained through early intervention, the actors in charge expect the extant measures to fail to some degree. They believe it is simply impossible to prevent all pandemics from happening. But steps can and should be taken through emergency preparation to lessen an unavoidable pandemic\u2019s impact. As Andrew Lakoff (2007, pp. 253\u2013254) summarizes:\nPreparedness assumes the disruptive, potentially catastrophic nature of certain events. Since the probability and severity of such events cannot be calculated, the only way to avert catastrophes is to have plans to address them already in place and to have exercised for their eventuality\u2014in other words, to maintain an ongoing capability to respond appropriately.\n",

This issue has primarily been addressed at two levels: first, by changing global security policies after the 9/11 attacks, and, second, by scrutinizing the narratives and rhetorical strategies through which the emergency imaginary is constructed and gains plausibility (e.g. Massumi 2005; Aradau and van Munster 2011; Horn 2014). In this chapter, I will focus on organizations as key actors in these processes of emergency planning. Without the capacity of organizations to produce binding decisions for their members, which allows them to plan for an uncertain future, pandemic preparedness would not be feasible\u2014especially not on a global scale.",

With regard to the WHO, which was established in 1948, I will discuss the question of how supranational coordination and planning for the future is rendered possible by building formal organizations and organizational networks at a global level. I will then highlight some aspects of the attempts undertaken by the WHO and its partners after the year 2000 to fight pandemics on a global scale. My analysis of relevant policy papers, legal norms and manuals shows that two different though complementary strategies are applied: early intervention and emergency planning.1 These are, as I will discuss more explicitly in the final section, two different kinds of organizing (for) the future or, to put it differently, two modes of how organizations manage pandemics. The overall aim of the empirical analysis offered in this chapter is to reconstruct organizational programmes and rationales rather than to give an account of the actual operations of these systems. The focus lies on public discourses and normative texts and not so much on the \u2018inside\u2019 of these organizations, meaning their day-to-day routines and practices.",

Pathogens connect distant regions and different kinds of people; zoonoses even trespass the boundary between animals and humans. By doing so, communicable diseases create spaces and communalities that did not exist before. This is also the reason why every epidemic requires new maps (e.g. Koch 2015).",

In passing the International Health Regulations (IHR) of 1969, which superseded the International Sanitation Regulations of 1951, the WHO established standards and norms with a legally binding character for its signatory states. The primary goal of these regulations was to provide \u2018maximum security against the international spread of disease with the minimum interference with world traffic\u2019 (WHO 1962, p. 5). To this end, epidemiological surveillance and alarm systems were installed in signatory states, or already existing structures were expanded. In addition, the WHO made more specific efforts to combat infectious diseases. One of the first large projects was the Global Malaria Eradication Program (1955\u20131969). In order to defeat the dangerous tropical disease, the insecticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was used liberally and repeatedly in over 60 countries. Even though certain regions profited from this measure, the actors in charge had to accept in the end that this goal was, on the whole, too ambitious (Zimmer 2017, pp. 198\u2013362). More successful, however, was the vaccination programme against smallpox, which was enacted in 1959 and intensified in 1966 (Fenner et al. 1988, pp. 365\u2013592, 1103\u201348). After roughly 20 years, it finally reached its goal. In 1980, the WHO announced: \u2018smallpox is dead!\u2019 (ibid., p. 1106).",

As well as mutual agreements and legally binding contracts, inter- or supranational organizations are a specific form taken by such leagues today. Drawing on Niklas Luhmann (1964), organizations can be perceived as a type of social system that is defined by formal membership roles and processes of decision-making. As inter- or supranational organizations demonstrate, not only natural but also legal persons, such as states, can become members of organizations. By entering an organization, sovereign nation states are, in principle, capable of producing collectively binding decisions on a global level, without losing their autonomy to a sovereign world state.",

These organizations are the main action centres within the field of global public health. They deliver expertise, develop policies, launch programmes and mobilize the global community. To achieve their goals, they regularly ally with other organizations and build networks that can be activated when necessary. This especially holds true for the global fight against pandemics.

For this reason, the IHR (WHO 2005a, pp. 43\u201346; see also WHO 2012) stipulates a risk-assessment matrix for signatory countries: after a local surveillance unit has detected an event \u2018that may constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019 (WHO 2005a, p. 43), three yes/no questions regarding its actual and potential impact must be answered. Then, it is determined whether the event should be rated as unusual or unexpected. If the answers are all positive, the WHO must be notified within 24 hours. If they are not all positive, there are two further levels of such yes/no questions, which address the risk of international spread and, in a final step, the possibility that countries or other entities would impose international travel or trade restrictions in response to the outbreak. The answers to these questions then determine whether notifying the WHO is required or not.",

Although the future horizon has darkened with the looming prospect of ecological, political and economic crises, not all hope is lost.

To strengthen organizational resiliency against the stresses and strains that may result from a pandemic, thorough preparation is required. \u2018In the absence of early and effective planning, countries may face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, distribution difficulties, and shortages of supplies\u2019 (p. 5). Emergency planning is furthermore imperative since \u2018[t]he failure of businesses to sustain operations would add to the economic consequences of a pandemic.

Furthermore, business continuity plans have to be developed. For this purpose, a pandemic coordinator should be assigned to oversee the planning process.

In analysing these programmes, the focus lies not so much on the actual operation of the system\u2014since it is always a creative translation of cognitive and normative schemes into concrete practice\u2014but rather on the intended actions of the system.

Because the goal is to prevent a further unfolding of potential threats into actual damages, time is of the essence in detection.

The goal here shifts from preventing the spread of disease towards securing the \u2018auto poiesis\u2019 (Maturana and Varela 1987, pp. 47\u201352) of the system, meaning its ability to reproduce itself even under enormous environmental pressures. While early intervention requires organizations to be capable of acting quickly, pandemic preparedness aims to produce robust systems that are immune to breakdown.",

The underlying assumption is that pandemics can be avoided through early detection and rapid response. The future scenario of early intervention is therefore an altogether positive one, in which organizations are capable of doing their job in the face of danger, namely containing infectious diseases. Pandemic preparedness, in contrast, works not with one but with two kinds of damages: primary damages, which cannot be prevented, and preventable consequential damages, which pose an existential threat. The aim is still to prevent harm, but preparedness does not focus on the pandemics per se but on the fatal repercussions that they might have for societies. This is a minimal form of prevention, and it is no longer believed that it is possible to escape such a pandemic unscathed. Both modes of relating to the future do not exclude but rather complement each other. If early intervention does not work in a specific scenario, there is still a second prevention strategy, which, of course, can only partially contain the effects of the pandemic since (massive) harm will have already occurred. But by strengthening the resilience of organizations and societies, pandemic preparedness aims to preserve existential functions and operations.",

According to Perrow , fundamental social functions are maintained by private and public organizations. This also holds true for responding to pandemics. In a \u2018society of organizations\u2019 (Perrow 1991), it is organizations and their professionals who manage pandemics. But two kinds of organizations have to be distinguished which correspond to the two modes or programmes for managing emerging infectious diseases: first, organizations and professionals in the public health sector try to prevent pandemics through early intervention (and further preventative measures, such as vaccination programmes). It is their job to protect the general public from health risks; this is the purpose of these specialized organizations and the goal of their corresponding professional activities . Second, and in contrast, all organizations that provide basic services for society are asked to make emergency plans and prepare themselves for the next pandemic. This includes public health organizations but is also addressed to, first and foremost, private and public organizations that provide food, water, defence, law and order, finance, transportation, telecommunications and energy.",

Organizations and professionals in the public health sector may not always succeed in preventing pandemics: as we have seen, they are well aware of this fact, and that is why emergency plans are developed in the first place. But this implies that, in principle, all organizations that provide basic services for society have to professionalize themselves in this specific area. One could describe this as a \u2018colonization\u2019 of non-health organizations through public health imperatives. This is, of course, not a completely new development if one considers, for instance, company doctors or health and safety officers. Furthermore, many large organizations have undergone a professionalization in areas that do not traditionally belong to their core activities , such as when they maintain legal, public relations or research departments, or when they offer childcare or psychological counselling to their employees. To some extent, this is a likely consequence of the \u2018functional differentiation of modern societies\u2019 (Luhmann 1997): even if organizations are typically specialized in providing only one or two services, they have to take further social functions into account. What is new here is the kind of task, that is, preparing for pandemics in order to prevent the worst-case scenario\u2014a complete breakdown of the system that would result from the absence of employees due to illness. In a society of organizations, the autopoiesis of society as whole cannot be separated from the autopoiesis of its organizations. Preserving society in a public health emergency depends on keeping organizations functional.",
