Next, the relationship between smoking status, sleep duration (quartiles), time on public transportation while commuting (quartiles) and whether eyeglasses or contact lenses are worn, i.e., routine behaviors thought to be associated with URTIs, and susceptibility to URTI was also assessed using a multiple logistic regression model. Univariate analysis using a logistic regression model was then performed to assess the relationship between susceptibility to URTI and how often the eyes or nose are touched. Afterwards, multivariate-adjusted odds ratios adjusted for age (continuous variable), sex (male/female), BMI (continuous variable), receipt or lack of influenza vaccination, how often the hands are washed, how often one gargles, how often a flu mask is worn, smoking status, sleep duration, time on public transportation while commut-ing and whether eyeglasses or contact lenses are worn and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a multiple logistic regression model.

The current study indicated that susceptibility to URTI and how often the eyes or nose are touched were significantly associated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited \"avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth\" as a behavior to further prevent influenza infection in the home, school and workplace 4) . In a school setting, Stebbins S, et al. studied the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical intervention including the recommendation to \"avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth\" to reduce the spread of influenza 5) . To the extent known, however, no studies appear to have epidemiologically studied the practice of touching the eyes or nose and susceptibility to URTI (includ-ing influenza) in workers. URTIs occur in the upper respiratory tract, i.e., sites ranging from the nasal vestibule on down to the nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx. They include the common cold, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis and epiglottitis. The most frequent URTI is the common cold and the primary pathogens responsible are viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses 6) . Infection with the influenza virus presents mainly with respiratory symptoms primarily in the form of an upper respiratory infection, so it is considered a URTI. Thus, the current study defined a URTI by specifying \"the common cold\" and \"influenza\". Transmission of viruses that cause a URTI can occur by any of the three major modes: 1) hand contact with secretions that contain the virus, 2) small-particle aerosols lingering in the air for an extended time or 3) direct contact with largeparticle aerosols from an infected person. Of these, \"small-particle aerosols\" are thought to be the major mode of transmission for the influenza virus 6, 7) . In contrast, the most efficient mode of transmission for rhinoviruses, the pathogens that most often cause the common cold, is \"hand contact\"; the viruses are ultimately transmitted to an individual through contact of the hands with the mucosa of the eyes or nose 7\u22129) . Thus, reducing instances in which the eyes or nose are touched by the hands or fingers as part of everyday activities is considered to be an effective precaution to prevent URTIs caused by rhinoviruses. The current study indicated that susceptibility to URTI and how often the eyes or nose are touched are significantly associated. The results suggested that avoiding touching the eyes or nose may help to prevent URTIs caused by rhinoviruses.",

The causal relationship between behaviors to prevent URTIs (which include how often the eyes or nose are touched) and routine behaviors associated with URTIs and susceptibility to URTI cannot be determined based on the results of this study. The second limitation is the potential for recall bias. Nevertheless, \"not touching the eyes or nose\" is not necessarily widely perceived as a behavior to prevent URTIs, so recall bias may have had little effect. The third limitation is that the current study surveyed subjects via a self-administered questionnaire, but the reliability and validity of this questionnaire were not tested. There are limits to the accuracy with which susceptibility to URTI, behaviors to prevent URTIs and routine behaviors associated with URTIs can be ascertained. Fourthly, there are several differences between the common cold and influenza such as the impact of the symptoms or the prescription medications. Therefore, we should have analyzed them separately regarding the relationship between the practice of touching of the eyes or nose and susceptibility to URTI. However, the subjects were asked to answer about the past frequency of the common cold and influenza together, and it would have been difficult for them to distinguish between them from memory. Thus we could not analyze them separately in this study. In addition, the appropriateness of the definition of a frequent incidence of URTIs as \"more than once a year\" in this study needs to be determined. Even though \"frequent incidence of URTIs\" was redefined as \"URTIs more than several times a year\", the results were the same except that statistically significant associations with BMI and sleep duration were no longer noted. The fifth limitation is that we did not include several variables that may be risk factors affecting the susceptibility to URTI, such as family environment (i.e., living with children) and medical history (i.e., chronic respiratory disease and diabetes). Moreover, the current study surveyed only workers at specific firms residing in or around Tokyo, so there is a question of whether this sample is representative of workers as a whole. In addition, this study's population has an issue concerning generalizability to the general population, such as the confounding factor of the healthy worker's effect.",
