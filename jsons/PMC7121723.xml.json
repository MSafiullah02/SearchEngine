This delay was associated with an increase in DNA strand breaks in the arterial wall. When the same mouse model was fed a high-cholesterol diet and ovarioectomized there was an increase in atherogenesis.10\n",

During low-flow myocardial ischemia A2aR supports myocardial contractility.50 Mice with deletion of adenylyl cyclase type V (AC-V\u2212/\u2212) demonstrate enhanced basal left ventricular function than WT controls, but there is a reduced response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation.51\n",

Adipose tissue is an important regulator of energy homeostasis. It functions as an endocrine organ secreting adipokines including adiponectin (APN). Studies using adiponectin transgenic (overexpression) and knockout mice demonstrate that adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing adipokine and that obesity can result in insulin resistance and diabetes. At least two different adiponectin receptors have been cloned (AdipoR1 and ApipoR2) comprising a novel cell-surface receptor family acting as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin. These receptors mediate increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase, and PPAR-\u03b1, as well as glucose uptake and fatty-acid oxidation by adiponectin.66,67 Intraglomerular macrophage infiltration and mRNA levels of VCAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, collagen type I/III, and NADPH oxidase are all increased in adiponectin knockout (APN\u2212/\u2212) mice than in WT, when subjected to subtotal nephrectomy and the resulting hypertension. Changes in the APN\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury from increased inflammation and oxidative stress.68 Studies conducted on transgenic mice overexpressing native full-length APN, targeted to white adipose tissue, revealed that adipose mass and adipocyte size were reduced while caloric intake was maintained constant. APN\u2212/\u2212 mice also show decreases in preadipocyte factor-1 mRNA and increased CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 in white adipose tissue.69 Shinmura et al.70 compared adiponectin antisense transgenic mice with WT to demonstrate that the cardioprotective effects of short-term caloric restriction are mediated by increased production of adiponectin and the resulting activation of AMP-activated protein kinase.",

Both Tie-1-DeltaN and control mice demonstrated equal levels of hypertension. Tie-1-DeltaN mice developed less renal injury, reduced inflammatory responses, and less albuminuria than controls. There was also a significantly reduced expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, targets of NF-\u03baB. The investigators concluded that in vivo NF-\u03baB suppression in endothelial cells blocks a signaling cascade leading to reduced hypertension-induced renal damage in the face of hypertension.150\n",

RCT is a pathway for transport of cholesterol that has accumulated in the vessel wall to the liver where it can be excreted.

A critical portion of this process is cholesterol efflux. Accumulated cholesterol is removed from macrophages in the subintima of the vessel wall by ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter-A1 (ABC-A1), or by other mechanisms including passive diffusion, scavenger receptor-B1, caveolins, and sterol 27-hydroxylase. The cholesterol is then available to be collected by HDL and/or ApoA-I. Studies in ABC-A1\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrate that disruption of ABC-A1 genes induces atherosclerosis and that proinflammatory cytokines exert atherosclerotic effects, at least partially, by impairing RCT and cholesterol efflux.209\n",

            "text": "Hinkel et al.220 have shown that the retrograde infusion of embryonic eEPCs into zones of myocardial ischemia provides rapid paracrine protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Intact pigs were subjected to 60 min of ischemia via percutaneous occlusion of the LAD. After 55 min of ischemia control eEPCs or cells transfected with thymosin \u03b2-4 (T-\u03b2-4) shRNA or T-\u03b2-4 alone were infused retrograde into the anterior interventricular vein. These studies demonstrate that the short-term cardioprotection resulting from retrograde infusion of eEPCs is, at least partially, due to T-\u03b2-4.",
