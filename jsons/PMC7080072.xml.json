One of these methods are so-called metapopulation models, which consider distinct spatial locations called patches. In each patch, an epidemic model describes the spread of an infectious disease among members of the local population. The locations are then coupled in a graph, with the patches as vertices and arcs representing the possibility for individuals in the various epidemiological states to travel between locations.",

One aspect that has not been the object of much attention is the effect of the interconnection of patches with very different population sizes on the dynamics of disease propagation in the coupled system. Wang and Zhao (2008) consider a model for two patches with periodic coefficients of infection and movement rates. Fromont et al. (2003) consider Feline Leukemia Virus in a metapopulation of cats living either in farms or in villages. In these papers, the authors consider coupled patches with some having mass action incidence and others with standard incidence.",

Large cities are indeed often associated to smaller cities of two main types. Suburban areas are most of the time very close to the major city. They can have distinct administrative structures, but a large fraction of their inhabitants commute to the large city (or to other suburban areas) during the work week, if not every day. They also often offer some of the amenities of the large city, such as shopping centres or recreational areas, so inhabitants of the latter also visit them regularly. They are difficult to distinguish from the large city and from a modelling perspective, the large city and its suburbs can generally be considered as a single unit. The other type of structures peripheral to a large urban area are so-called satellite cities. These are generally cities in their own right, located further away from the main city than are suburban areas. However, they are connected to the main city in many ways. For instance, while they generally have hospitals, these facilities are often able to deal only with general cases, with severe cases having to be treated in the large city\u2019s facilities. Although not as closely integrated as a major city and suburban cities, individuals make regular movements between the locations.",

On the other hand, a change of incidence function within a single population can lead to complicated dynamics; see, e.g., Arino and McCluskey (2010). Does the coupling of patches with different incidence functions affect the dynamics of a metapopulation disease transmission model?From a more practical point of view, urban centre and satellite cities systems abound. In such configurations, what drives disease propagation in the entire system? Can satellite cities \u201cinfect\u201d the urban centre, can they protect themselves from infection by the urban centre? Does the size of a city play a role in its vulnerability to invasion by an infectious disease or its role in facilitating the spread of this disease?Some mathematical analysis is conducted. Then the model is specialized numerically to several cities in the province of Manitoba (Canada): Winnipeg, the capital and largest urban centre with about 700,000 inhabitants, and satellite cities located some distance from Winnipeg.",

There is a lot of debate about the nature of incidence functions (McCallum et al. 2001) and the interpretation that follows is by no means the only one possible. Here, as in the work of Arino and McCluskey (2010), it is assumed that mass action incidence is appropriate for smaller populations, while standard (or proportional) incidence better fits larger communities. Since the communities are much smaller than the urban centre, the nature of contacts is different. In the smaller communities, it is quite conceivable that an inhabitant can meet any other inhabitant, which is well described by a mass action incidence function. On the other hand, a large urban centre has several major shopping areas, numerous neighbourhoods, etc. Many inhabitants spend their days in a small number of neighbourhoods, rarely if ever visiting others. This situation is better reproduced by a proportional incidence function.\n",

Per capita air travel rates from these communities to and from Winnipeg is much higher than the average travel rate between larger sized Canadian cities. For instance, using the method of computation of travel rates explained earlier and air transportation data from the BioDiaspora Project (see, e.g., Arino and Khan 2014), it is found that, in 2012, the per capita rate of air travel from Churchill (Manitoba) to Winnipeg was almost 450 times that from Toronto to Winnipeg and still more than 50 times the total rate out of Toronto to all 1,600 final destinations reached from there in 2012. Statistics Canada data (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/health-sante/index-eng.htm) shows that in 2013, for the Burntwood/Churchill Health Region that comprises all of Northern Manitoba, the average life expectancy at birth was 71.0 years (compared to Canada\u2019s 81.1 years or Winnipeg\u2019s 80.1 years).

For this, Winnipeg and its three main satellite cities were used with parameters appropriate for influenza. One possible mechanism for deriving rates of movement between cities was discussed, using estimates of the average daily number of car trips between Winnipeg and the three smaller cities that were obtained in Appendix . It was observed that the large city, Winnipeg, governed for the most part the behaviour of the system. Only Portage la Prairie, which has the smallest rate of movement to and from Winnipeg, was able to trigger an epidemic if all other cities (including Winnipeg) had a low value of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\mathcal {R}}_{0}^x=0.5$$\\end{document}R0x=0.5.
