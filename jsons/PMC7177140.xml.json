            "text": "Across the world, a significant number of countries have substantial natural resource reserves such as minerals, oil, and natural gas. The fortunes of those countries often underwent dramatic changes as the discovery of resources spurred economic activity and substantially increased their revenues, but not necessarily improving the well-being of their citizens overall. Many of these countries have faced political upheavals and the reversal of initial economic gains, and some have ended up in a worse situation than they were before the discovery of the natural resources. Countries which have suffered from this \u201cresource curse\u201d (Sachs & Warner, 1999) include Zimbabwe, Iraq, Libya, and DR Congo. The primary reasons for such undesired outcomes are mismanagement of the new resources, internal power struggles, rampant corruption, sharp fluctuations in the value of the rent resource, increasing population, and de-industrialization in other sectors (Hertog, 2010; Hvidt, 2013; Kaya & Tsai, 2016; Van der Ploeg, 2011). However, not all resource-rich countries suffer from this inverse relationship between resource wealth and social chaos and underdevelopment (Gray, 2011; Levins, 2012). Norway, Australia, and Canada are among the industrially advanced countries which possess large natural resources but have maintained a stable political system and relative immunity to wild fluctuations in the value of their resources (Mehlum, Moene, & Torvik, 2006).",

However, these states rely heavily on oil and gas revenues for funding state expenses as well as covering the costs of imports (Kaya & Tsai, 2016). They are keenly aware of the potential pitfalls of such a dependence on a single natural resource, and have therefore initiated a series of developmental plans and visions to diversify their economies (Tsai & Kaya, 2016). In this paper, we define them as \u201ctransformative states\u201d in their quest for economic diversification, and focus on their potential to achieve this target through a case study on Qatar.",

After a lull during World War II, international interest in oil in the region resumed post-war, and investment for exploration and drilling in the region increased rapidly (Kubursi, 1986). During the 1950s and 1960s, a string of new oil fields, both onshore and offshore, were discovered that propelled the country's oil production to more 400,000 barrels per day (Al\u2010Siddiqi & Dawe, 1999). After Qatar gained independence in 1971, the largest single natural gas field in the world (the North Field) was discovered, which stretches from the northern shores of Qatar to its maritime borders with Iran. The North Field contains 872 trillion cubic feet of non-associated gas in a single location, which accounts for 14.3% of the world's total known conventional gas reserves (BP, 2018). The exploitation of this huge gas field was very limited in the 1970s and 1980s (Al\u2010Siddiqi & Dawe, 1999), but there has been rapid development regarding extraction and utilization of the natural gas in the North Field since the 1990s. Large-scale investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its sale on world markets have made Qatar one of the largest natural gas exporters in the world. While a relatively small producer of crude oil (accounting for less than 1% of the world's production), Qatar is currently the world leader of LNG production and export, with a capacity of more than 80 million tons of LNG per year (D'Alessandro, 2018; Tsafos, 2018). Furthermore, the country has the largest gas-to-liquids (GTL) facility in the world with a capacity of around 200,000 barrels per day, in which natural gas is processed into oil derivatives such as naphtha and diesel (Ahmed et al., 2019). Figure 2\nshows the timeline of developments in Qatar regarding the utilization of the natural gas found in the North Field.",

The state-owned Qatar Petroleum (QP) has joint ventures (JV) and sub-units covering all aspects, from exploration and drilling of oil and gas to their refinement and liquefaction, transportation, and marketing to international customers (Ibrahim & Harrigan, 2012). QP-owned Nakilat operates more than 14 large-tonnage ships to transport LNG to the world markets. QP is currently studying an ambitious plan to expand its operations from LNG production to petrochemical products in tandem with its international partners. Qatar has greatly benefited from the strategic and wise management of its oil and gas reserves by QP. However, the volatility and recent fall in international oil prices have seriously affected state revenues and made economic diversification a matter of urgency.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are grouped under the mining and quarrying sector, whereas petrochemical production is included in the manufacturing sector in the report published by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics of Qatar. This report indicates that the majority of Qatar's manufacturing activity occurs in the petrochemical sector, which is directly linked to oil and gas (MDPS, 2018). As a result, oil and gas-related businesses in the productive circuit, which is solely under state control, constitute the majority of the economic activity in the country (Gray, 2011). Countries in the Middle East have the lowest oil and gas production costs in the world (less than USD 15 per barrel) thanks to the concentration in the region of conventional oil and gas fields, which are less technically challenging and less costly to develop than unconventional sources (Kilian, 2016). With average oil prices in excess of USD 50 per barrel, the profits from hydrocarbon-related revenues have been unmatched in any other sector in the productive circuit. Figure 5\nshows the average cost of oil production, in USD per barrel, across the world for the year 2015.",

Figure 6\nhighlights the ownership structure of the major banks operating in Qatar where majority of the shares are either owned by the state via Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) or merchant families touted as Khaleeji Capital (Hanieh, 2016). The finance circuit in Qatar serves a crucial role in transferring revenue surplus (excess profits) from the productive circuit to domestic economic activities, especially to the commodity circuit. By having a significant degree of control in the management of the financial system, the Qatari government is able to use these excess funds to further strengthen \u201cthe ruling agreement\u201d (Gray, 2011; Levins, 2012). The allocation of credit by state-controlled banks to domestic private businesses (merchant families) is not just based on their economic performance, but also on the relationship between the two entities (Hvidt, 2011). The business families and tribes which have a close relationship with the ruling family, and hence the state, are usually able to access easy and favorable credit from the banks (Yalcin, 2015). The finance circuit, therefore, is effectively used as a bridge between the productive circuit and the commodity circuit.",

Darwish Trading Company (DTC) is owned and managed by the powerful Fakhro family. The conglomerate operates in numerous businesses such as car dealerships, distribution networks for timber and other commodities within the domestic economy, imports of building materials, domestic apparel, furniture, and office supplies. DTC was established in 1934 as one of the oldest family firms in Qatar with more than 500 employees.

Following the oil embargo of 1973, it became not just a valuable but also an extremely strategic commodity for the global economy (Hamilton, 2011). The price of oil has been subject to fluctuation and change throughout the last 50 years (Baffes & Kshirsagar, 2016): Figure 10\nillustrates this constant volatility in the oil price between 1970 and 2014. Since 2010, the supply of oil and gas extracted from shale, Canadian tar sands, and offshore production have increased, culminating in a sharp price drop (Arezki & Blanchard, 2014). There is a good chance that oil prices may never go back to a point where most oil-producing states can balance their budgets (Kilian, 2016). In addition to the invention of new oil technologies and the discovery of new oil deposits, increasing efforts to decarbonize the global economy in a bid to tackle climate change have already started to dent the demand for oil and gas in the transportation and power sectors (Kuczy\u0144ski & Denis, 2018). This increases volatility in the revenues Qatar receives from oil and gas exports (as shown in Figure 9 above).",

The anticipated replacement of oil-based ICE cars with EVs should result in much lower demand, and therefore in a lower price for oil by the 2030s. The advancement of EVs is expected to shave a sizeable demand for oil and gas more than 20 million barrels per day for the whole world (the red bar in Figure 13\n) with dramatic repercussions for the oil and gas rich countries such as Qatar (Arbib & Seba, 2017). It is very likely that global oil prices could drop to a range of USD 20 to USD 30 per barrel once EVs spread widely across the global market circa 2030 and lower the demand for oil and gas.",

First, entrepreneurs are critical for the transition to a knowledge-based economy to reduce dependence on hydrocarbon-related industries (Kaya and Tsai 2016). Second, encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit which shifts employees out of the public sector workforce also reduces the burden on the public finances (lowering the fiscal breakeven point as it relates to oil prices, as depicted in Figure 14).

            "text": "In this context, the authorities in Qatar have shown an increasing interest in supporting entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the push towards an innovation-based economy (Ennis, 2015). The highest echelons of the state apparatus have made support to SMEs and entrepreneurs inside the country a top priority in order to diversify the economy away from the oil and gas sectors. These initiatives and support schemes are driven by the expectation that well-paying jobs will be created in the private sector, easing pressure on the state's welfare capacity (Kshetri & Ajami, 2008). In line with other GCC states, countless initiatives have been launched in Qatar to foster innovation and entrepreneurship to spearhead economic diversification (Miniaoui & Schilir\u00f2, 2017). The Education City was established in 1997 and gradually expanded by opening campuses of well-known US universities to deliver vital education and knowledge transfer from abroad (Ennis, 2015). To help the commercialization of ideas and the opening of SMEs, numerous agencies and centres have opened, including Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), Qatar Business Innovation Center (QBIC), Bedaya, Injaz, the Roudha Center and Qatar Social Development Center (QSDC). Financial support and guidance for entrepreneurs and new business people are delivered through Qatar Development Bank (QDB) and Qatar Financial Center (QFC) with generous packages and flexible payment plans, especially for Qatari nationals (Ennis, 2015). The state of Qatar has recently taken regulatory actions to make business easier and to remove hurdles faced by entrepreneurs (Ennis, 2015). However, the country's \u201cEase of Doing Business\u201d rankings have slipped globally since 2010, as can be seen in Figure 15\n. The \u201cEase of Doing Business\u201d index measures a country's performance in terms of the ease of establishing a new firm or company (permits, licences, and registration) and protecting its rights (cross-border payments, a predictable tax regime, and contract enforcement), where the top-ranked country has the best environment for doing business (Jayasuriya, 2011). This index thus provides a broad measure of a country's receptivity to foreign investment and its position with regard to the protection of business rights such as equal access to the market and contract enforcement. In 2018, Qatar ranked 83 out of 190 countries.",

            "text": "Since UAE is close to Qatar in terms of population, income, and geographical location, the experience of the UAE can provide both important lessons (Parcero & Ryan, 2017). The federal structure of the UAE, in which each emirate has its own jurisdiction, creates an internally competitive economic environment which has paved the way for a business-friendly environment since the 1990s, especially in Dubai (Krane, 2009). The establishment of numerous free zones and a sound legal system attracted much-needed entrepreneurial talent which culminated in the creation of the region's most successful startups such as Souq.com and Kareem (Parcero & Ryan, 2017). The absolutist political system seen in most of the GCC states has been countered in UAE by the federal structure and economic autonomy of each state (Tsai & Kaya, 2016). Although relatively limited \u2014 and quickly depleted \u2014 Dubai's oil and gas reserves played an active role in the 1990s in creating a business-friendly environment and acting as a magnet to attract talented expatriates (Davidson, 2008). UAE's high score in the ease of doing business index takes account of a variety of inclusivity factors such as protection of private property, ease of entry to markets, and low levels of corruption, which can be partly attributed to its structure, which is postulated as \u201cmarket-preserving federalism\u201d (Kaya & Tsai, 2016; Weingast, 1995). UAE has also diverted some of its sovereign wealth fund (SWF) investments into more technical companies, startups and other potentially risky investments in a bid for higher returns, in contrast to the classical and risk-averse approach generally pursued in the GCC states (Amar, Carpantier, & Lecourt, 2018; Braunstein, 2019; Hvidt, 2018). Given Qatar's limited industrial and manufacturing base, the scope for innovation and entrepreneurial success in high value-added sectors seems limited, at least in the short term. To compensate for the lack of investment opportunities in advanced and high value-added domestic industries, Qatar can look overseas for investment in these areas. QIA has assets of more than USD 300 billion invested globally (Amar et al., 2018). Some of those funds, together with future surpluses from oil and gas sales, can be invested in high-tech startups and companies in countries like the USA or China. This will diversify Qatar's portfolio and help to safeguard the government's income stream against any dramatic change in the value of oil and gas.",

            "text": "Whatever the incentives, the potential for innovation and entrepreneurship cannot be realized if there is not enough capacity within the system which has been built on past experience and knowledge (Coombs & Hull, 1998; Ernst & Kim, 2002). A country's industrial and services infrastructure and a pool of experienced labour are great sources of innovation and entrepreneurship particularly in terms of responding to problems and opportunities that occur during normal work operations (Fuchs & Shapira, 2005). A sizeable number of entrepreneurs work on fields and areas closely related to their previous employment and experience, often driven by the search for solutions to a problem or the quest to fill an identified product gap (Parker, 2009). Minniti & Bygrave (2001) similarly note that entrepreneurs greatly benefit from their previous experience in industry or service sectors while pursuing new business. As discussed in section 2, the productive circuit in Qatar is largely concentrated in the oil and gas industries and petrochemicals sector. Further industrial expansion has happened on a limited scale in energy-intensive sectors such as aluminum and steel production (Ibrahim & Harrigan, 2012). The commodity circuit in the country encompasses general service sectors such as dealerships, education, and healthcare, catering to local demand. Compared to a more industrialized country, therefore, the level of industrial and service experience of Qatar's labour force is limited to a few areas. Moreover, a sizeable portion of those skilled jobs are held by short to medium-stay expatriates in the absence of a large local population. It can be argued that the country does not possess a very large pool of entrepreneurial talent due to the transformative economic structure, the temporary status of skilled labour, and the small size of the local population. In this context, too, Qatar might consider following the example of UAE's attempts to attract foreign talent by offering incentives such as full ownership of a company and residency, and a fair and equal playing level (at least in certain non-oil industries and businesses). In fact, Qatar has passed a number of laws and amendments in recent years to allow foreigners to purchase real estate and to set up a company with full ownership in certain zones and sectors, as well as granting residency visas without a local sponsor (Ulrichsen, 2018). These are sensible steps for the country to take in attracting international talent while heavily investing in the education of locals and supporting them in their entrepreneurial ambitions.",

After gaining its independence in 1971, Qatar embarked on a rapid development trajectory with a world-class infrastructure and very high living standards. It has the highest GDP per capita in the world as a result of the successful utilization and channelling of its oil and gas fortunes (IMF, 2018). The state has retained its centuries-old tribal system and absolutist governance while spearheading the way for a transformative economic structure based on oil and gas revenues (Luciani, 1990). In exchange for the lack of political rights and representation in decision making, the population has been economically compensated by the state in two ways. First, and akin to the other GCC states, Qatar established a very generous welfare system whereby citizens are entitled to free education, housing, and healthcare, as well as well-paying public sector jobs (military, police, bureaucracy) all funded by oil and gas revenues (Gray, 2011). Additionally, the merchant families, including some of the ruling tribe (Al-Thani), were granted exclusive business licences and favourable credit to establish and run firms in the commodity circuit such as dealerships, services, and trading companies as the second leg of economic support to citizens (Kaya & Tsai, 2016). The state has kept the majority of the productive circuit to itself, including all oil and gas-related activities, the petrochemical industry, and energy-intensive industries such as aluminum and steel, in order to maintain its economic authority (Ibrahim & Harrigan, 2012).",

The rapid development and exponential deployment of renewable energy technologies coupled with the electrification of transportation pose a serious threat to the value of oil and gas and hence to the revenues collected by the state (Arbib & Seba, 2017). All the GCC states including Qatar have experienced rapid growth in their local populations which puts considerable pressure on those states which seek to maintain the transformative status quo for a larger population (Kaya & Tsai, 2016). The high oil and gas prices of the past decade encouraged the development of previously uneconomical reservoirs such as deep offshore, shale formations, and tar sands (Kilian, 2016). The additional supplies from those new reserve fields have resulted in a glut and driven oil prices well below earlier levels, with the possibility that they may never recover (Kilian, 2016). Thus, the transformative states need to diversify their economies through knowledge-based and innovation-driven initiatives in order to maintain the current living standards and welfare of their citizens. Economic diversification has become a top priority in the GCC states to keep \u201cthe ruling agreement\u201d intact (Hertog, 2013).",

The government recently lifted the self-imposed moratorium on further gas production from the coveted North Field, and announced the expansion of natural gas production and an increase in LNG export capacity of more than 30% in the next four years (Rystad Energy, 2018). QP continues to pursue a very active oil and gas exploration, production, and exporting strategy on a global scale with its long-term partners such as Exxon Mobil and Total (Visconti, 2018). Beyond oil and gas, the country has undertaken infrastructure investment on a massive scale since 2000, with a special focus on the preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup (Agence France-Presse, 2017). The complete revamp of the country's infrastructure from seaports and airports to roads and hospitals is expected to be completed by 2021 (Agence France-Presse, 2017). The phase-out of this large-scale capital spending is expected to leave a surplus of rent revenue which the government can use for overseas investment in the years following 2021.",

            "text": "The process of innovation and entrepreneurship has been analysed in three sub-components for the case of Qatar. The potential, incentives, and capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship to promote a successful economic diversification away from dependence on oil and gas revenues appear to be limited in Qatar. The country has a unique demographic structure in which more than 80% of residents are expatriates, many working on short-term contracts and/or in low-skilled jobs (Ennis, 2015). Expatriates also constitute the majority of the technical and specialty employment positions, usually on a short- to medium-term basis. The recent push by the government for Qatarization of the workforce has slightly changed that dynamic as more Qatari nationals were employed in private or semi-government industries (Hertog, 2016). To date, attempts at innovation and entrepreneurship in the country have been largely geared towards import-substitution of basic goods (such as dairy products or perishable goods) and services, rather than risky high-tech ventures with much more promising returns (Ennis, 2015). However, the expansion of petroleum-related industries and energy-intensive sectors such as steel and aluminum could unlock further innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities in the country. Thanks to massive oil and gas revenues, \u201cthe ruling agreement\u201d between the leadership and the people has resulted in a cradle-to-grave welfare system which is unparalleled in the world (Kaya & Tsai, 2016), but which does not encourage innovation. The support provided to powerful merchant families by the government in the simple but lucrative \u201ccommodity circuit\u201d is another hidden barrier suppressing the motivation for entrepreneurial activity (Hanieh, 2016). These traditional measures to ensure the economic well-being of the citizens may become counterproductive to the incentives rolled out by the government in pursuit of innovation and entrepreneurship.",

In recent years, political differences among the GCC states of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and UAE, on the one hand, and Qatar, on the other, came to a head in the Gulf Crisis of 2017, in which the former three countries along with Egypt ceased any economic or political relationship with Qatar (Ulrichsen 2018). Sea, air, and land closures were imposed on Qatar, limiting flights by the country's airline, Qatar Airways, and restricting certain critical imports from Saudi Arabia and UAE. Qatar, in turn, established new trade routes and ramped up its domestic production in various sectors and industries (D'Alessandro, 2018; Tsafos, 2018; Ulrichsen, 2018). The effects of this crisis on the mindset and perception of all the stakeholders in Qatar and its repercussions regarding innovation and entrepreneurship have yet to be studied, but represent a critical research subject. A detailed analysis must be conducted in this regard to assess Qatar's new reality.",
