The digestive juice exists in the midgut lumen, and contains a variety of digestive enzymes and inorganic salts. These enzymes decompose organic matter into small peptides, carbohydrates, and lipids that are absorbed by epithelial cells and enter the circulatory system [6]. Previous studies have indicated that the enzymes form digestive juice not only function to digest food, but also play an important role in weakening or killing pathogens [5]. In silkworms, some digestive enzymes involved in antiviral activity have already been cloned and characterized, such as red fluorescent protein [7], lipase [8] and serine protease [9]. Alkaline trypsin was also purified from the digestive juice of B. mori larvae and showed strong antiviral activity [10]. Previous studies on insect immunity have focused on the fat body, midgut, and hemolymph. The protein composition of silkworm digestive juice and the mechanism of its antiviral proteins in the lumen after BmNPV challenge still require further study.",

Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) and label-free methods are attractive proteomic analysis technologies for researching the interaction between pathogens and B. mori. Wang et al. [12] performed a comparative subcellular proteomics analysis of the silkworm larval midgut response to BmNPV infection by 2-DE combined with MS. The iTRAQ method was also used to explore the molecular mechanisms of B. mori response to B. mori cypovirus (BmCPV) [13] and BmNPV [14] challenge. Additionally, the role of Hsp90 in BmN cells response to BmNPV infection was explored by TMT method [15]. The label-free quantitative technique is gaining fast traction in the proteomics field due to its rapid, straightforward, and low-cost required for measuring protein expression levels in complex biological samples [16,17].",

B. mori C-lysozyme (BmC-LZM) and BmAtlastin-n could enhance the resistance to BmNPV by overexpression in larvae and cells [18,19]. Furthermore, a GP64-binding protein E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SINA-like 10 (SINAL10) [20] and chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) [21] could stimulate BmNPV proliferation in BmN cells. Some studies regarding the role of the B. mori larval midgut in response to BmNPV infection have been conducted in previous studies utilizing RNA-Seq [22], 2-DE combined MS [12], label free [16] and iTRAQ methods [14]. Hu et al. [6] investigated changes in the protein composition of the silkworm digestive juice between non-infected and infected samples by shotgun and MS techniques. Their research, however, only involved the P50 susceptible strain. Although there is little information available on the digestive juice proteome of different resistant strains after BmNPV challenge. Our present study, notably, firstly made sure the virus inhibition difference of different resistant strain and following BmNPV infection. Consequently, we identified DEPs between A35 and P50 using the label-free proteomic technique. Further, possible functions of identified DEPs and their potential involvement in resistance to BmNPV infection are discussed. Our study provides insights into the functions of silkworm digestive juice in antiviral activity.",

Based on Venn diagram analysis, only one DEP was present in both groups (P50+ vs P50- and A35+ vs A35-). While 48 DEPs were found in the A35+ vs P50+ and A35- vs P50- (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that there are more variations in proteins of digestive juices in resistant strains than in susceptible strains following BmNPV infection.",

With regards to molecular function, the largest number of DEPs were related to serine-type endopeptidases, while DEPs involved in protein binding in A35 vs P50 were decreased from 10% to 6% following BmNPV infection. For biological processes category, there were largest number of DEPs associated with proteolysis, and the DEPs related to chitin metabolic process in A35 vs P50 were decreased from 5% to 3% following NPV infection.

In the present study, a total of 29 SPs were identified that were differentially expressed within the digestive juice of different resistant silkworm strains. The expression level of most SPs were up-regulated in the highly resistant A35 strain compared with susceptible P50 strain and further up-regulated in highly resistant A35 strain following NPV infection. Additionally, four SPs were identified that were potentially related to resistance to BmNPV in digestive juice by removing those DEPs related to either genetic background (A35- vs P50-) and individual immune stress response proteins (P50+ vs P50-). Nakazawa and Ponnuvel [9,10] previously reported that alkaline trypsin and SP-2 purified from the digestive juice of B. mori larvae had strong antiviral activity against BmNPV under in vitro conditions. Bm-SP142 could effectively impair the ability of the virus to infect BmN cells and silkworms, and over-expression of Bm-SP142 could inhibit viral propagation in BmN cells [40]. Additionally, Chen et al. [41] found that the some anti-BmNPV genes expressed significantly higher in the resistant strains compared to susceptible strains. These results suggested that SPs, an insect digestive enzyme, can be a potential antiviral factor against BmNPV at the initial site of viral infection.

In this study, two lipases (lipase member H-A and pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase) were differentially expressed. After BmNPV infection, the expression level of Lipase member H-A increased 3 times in the A35 strain, while no significant differences occurred in the P50 strain. These results suggest that the silkworm strain having higher expression level of lipase may also have stronger resistance to viral infection. Jiang et al.

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN), belonging to zinc-dependent metalloproteinase, is a major component in the insect gut epithelial membrane, with a primary function to cleave N-terminal amino acids. APN not only catalyzes protein proteolytic processes, but also is involved in the pathogenic process as the receptor of pathogenic toxin [45]. APN was the first molecule identified as a Cry toxin-binding protein from Manduca sexta [46,47], and it is an extensively studied putative receptor from other lepidopteran insect pests [47,48]. In the present study, three APNs (aminopeptidase N, membrane alanyl aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase N-7) were identified from four experiment groups. Interestingly, the three APNs were down-regulated in A35 compared to P50 strains and also downregulated following BmNPV. APN acts as the viral receptor of some group I coronaviruses, such as human coronavirus 229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), in order to allow the virus to enter to cell [49,50]. A study by Lucas et al. [51] indicated that membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N acts as a receptor for a plant virus in the pea aphid vector in vitro. Additionally, an APN interaction between BmDNV VD1 and ORF4 was identified by Co-immunoprecipitation [52]. We hypothesized that the APNs probably act as the receptor for BmNPV, or alternatively accelerate infection by interaction with BmNPV. The relationship between BmNPV and APN need to be explored in the future.",

            "text": "Regarding the other 21 enzymes within the identified DEPs, two DEPs related to chitin degradation were identified in all four groups being compared, including one chitin deacetylase (CDA, chitin deacetylase 5b) and one chitinase (chitinase isoform 3 precursor). Interestingly, the two enzymes were specially expressed in the susceptible BmNPV P50 strain (Table 1). In Helicoverpa armigera, the expression level of chitin deacetylase-like proteins were down-regulated following infection with H. armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus, which might reduce the susceptibility for baculovirus infection by decreasing its PM permeability [53]. This result suggested that the different resistance of silkworm strains might be related to expression level of chitinolytic enzymes by affecting the PM permeability after the virus infection. On the other hand, there were two differentially expressed phosphatase proteins, including prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). The expression level of PAP was down-regulated in A35 strain compared with P50 strain. Although the alkaline and acid phosphatase were reported to be involved in the transport of glucose and fatty acids on the intestinal wall membrane in B. mori [54], Wang et al. [22] found that the expression levels of PAP were decreased following BmNPV infection in resistant strains, and suggested that PAP could directly or indirectly participate in repressing BmNPV replication in host cells. Lee et al. [55] also reported that the lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2) was required for membrane fusion during influenza A virus (IAV) entry in mammal cells. Meanwhile, the expression level of AP in the P50 strain was higher than in the A35 strain (by Label free and Western blotting) (Fig. 7). These results were consistent with a previous report that showed the expression level of AP in midgut was up-regulated in P50 compared with BC9 (resistant BmNPV stain) [14]. Additionally, AP activity was decreased in the silkworm embryonic cells after BmNPV infection [56]. In summary, PAP and AP might play an important role in response to virus infection.",

            "text": "The larval midgut is targeted by baculovirus, which uses it as a portal of entry to later establish a systemic infection within the insect body. Thus, the immune response plays an important role in the defense against pathogens [57]. Here, four DEPs, including Spn-1, Spn-2, Spn-16 and PRP, are known to be related to the immune response were identified. Melanization is a major immune responses against large pathogens or parasites in arthropods, and phenoloxidase (PO) is a key enzyme in the melanization process [58]. In the insect immune response, Spn can bind to the active center of a serine protease during the extracellular serine protease cascade, which makes the serine protease unable to activate the next level serine protease or PPO, thereby inhibiting the cascade reaction, and finally inhibiting melanization [[59], [60], [61]]. In this study, the Spn-1 and Spn-2 proteins were found that it significantly down-regulated in A35+ vs A35- and A35- vs P50-. Interestingly, the Spn-16 specially expressed in P50 strain. Pan et al. [62] found that the expression of Spn-2 in the midgut were significantly increased in susceptible strain after infected with BmNPV, while there was no significant change in resistant strain. These results indicated that Spn-2 may be involved in the B. mori antiviral response. Additionally, serpin-5 and serpin-9 can promote baculovirus infection by inhibiting melanizationin in Helicoverpa armigera [63]. Based on these findings, we speculated that the down-regulation of expression of Spn in resistant strains or following BmNPV infection might lead to inhibition of serine proteases and enhance host melanization to suppress infection by BmNPV in resistant strains. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are pathogen molecules recognized by cells of the innate immune system (by pattern recognition receptors [PRRs]) [64]. Peptidoglycan recognition protein precursors (PRPs) were down-regulated in A35+ compared to A35-, but expression levels showed no difference in the P50 strain after BmNPV infection. Yu et al. [14] found that the pattern-recognition receptor-related proteins showed a different response to BmNPV infection in resistant strain vs non-resistant strains. As above all, the DEPs related to the immune response might play an important role in response to BmNPV infection in digestive juice.",

            "text": "In this study, a chlorophyllide A binding protein isoform X1 (CHBP) protein and red fluorescence protein were found in digestive juice. Interestingly, the expression level of CHBP was up-regulated but no significantly in control compared to BmNPV-challenged samples. However, it was significantly down-regulated in A35- compared to P50- strains. The red fluorescent protein (RFP) had antiviral properties and the red fluorescence was suggested to be derived from the binding between insect midgut proteins and chlorophyllid \u03b1, the prosthetic group of chlorophyll. Moreover, it was also suggested that anti-BmNPV activity was attributed to chlorophyllid \u03b1 rather than the protein [65,66]. Therefore, we speculated that the CHPB had an antiviral function in digestive juice, but is not the main contributing factor to silkworm resistance in the resistant strains. The peritrophic membrane (PM) as a first line of defense and is not absolutely responsible for the prevention of invasion of pathogenic microorganisms in insects, but the structural integrity of the PM may delay the invasion rate and delay the infection process [67,68]. Insect intestinal mucin (IIM) is an important part of the PM and plays an important role in protecting insects from microbial infection. Wang et al. [69] identified the first invertebrate intestinal mucin from Trichoplusia ni larva and showed that it can resist the degradation of protease in the midgut. Here, two IIMs (mucin-2, insect intestinal mucin precursors) were identified from digestive juice. The expression level of mucin-2 and insect intestinal mucin precursor were down-regulated in A35+ vs P50+ and A35- vs P50-, respectively. Wang et al. [70] reported that the IIM can be degraded by enhancin, a synergistic protein produced by Trichoplusia ni granulovirus (TnGV), which specifically interacts with IIM, leading to the destruction of the integrity of the PM and thereby increasing the chances of the virus entering epithelial cells and killing insects. Consequently, we speculated that the BmNPV had an enhancin homologue with a similar function as IIM that might play an important role in BmNPV infection. There are also some other non-enzymatic DEPs have been showed response to virus infection, we will further study these proteins and elucidate their roles in BmNPV infection in the future.",
