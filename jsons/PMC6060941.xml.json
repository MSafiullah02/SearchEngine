NiV is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, genus henipavirus. The name of the virus and disease is from the village of \u201cSungai Nipah\u201d in Malaysia where the virus was recognized in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers.[1] Both animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission have been documented. From 1998 to 2015, more than 600 cases of NiV human infections were reported. Subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh have occurred with high case fatality. A total of 276 cases were reported with 106 fatalities (38%) in Malaysia, but case fatalities in later outbreaks in India and Bangladesh were associated with significantly higher case fatality rates of 43\u2013100%.[2] NiV infection in humans has a range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory syndrome and fatal encephalitis. The natural reservoir of the virus consists of the widely distributed fruit bats from the Pteropodidae family.[3] Virus transmission from bats to humans occurs through inhalation, contact, or consumption of NiV contaminated foods.[4] NiV is transmitted by zoonotic (from bats to humans, or from bats to pigs, and then to humans) as well as human-to-human routes. Human-to-human transmission is particularly notable in the outbreaks in India and Bangladesh, where it has been reported to account for 75 and 51% of cases, respectively. At present no vaccines or antiviral drugs are available for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive.[5] Current prevention strategies focus on raising disease awareness in affected areas.",

            "text": "NiV was first isolated by Chua et al. in 1999 after a severe outbreak of viral encephalitis among pig farmers in Malaysia.[11] The virus, cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid of two patients, was causing the syncytial formation of Vero cells after 5 days, and it was found to be a previously undescribed paramyxovirus related to the Hendra virus (HeV). The henipavirus genus in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae (family Paramyxoviridae) was then created for these two pathogenic viruses, HeV and NiV.[12] Subsequently, other viruses were added to this genus. NiV is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The genome is unusually large, comprising more than 18,000 nucleotides. Its six genes code are the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G), and the large polymerase. The viral G protein attaches to the host cell ephrin B2 and/or B3 receptor, and activates the F protein to initiate viral envelope and host membrane fusion and viral entry.[13] A relative heterogeneity has been observed among nucleotide sequences obtained from Bangladesh/India as compared with sequences from samples obtained during the initial Malaysian outbreak. This observation led to the classification of two distinct lineages of NiV. Currently, the available sequences obtained from Malaysia and Cambodia were designated genotype M, while sequences obtained from Bangladesh and India were designated genotype B.[1415] A 729 nucleotide region of the N protein gene of NiV has been proposed that can be used for such genotyping. Predicted amino acid identities between NiV and the NiV diversity observed among isolates from bats in Malaysia (NiV-M) and Thailand (NiV-T) were associated with co-circulation of multiple strains within populations rather than co-evolutionary patterns.[15] NiV-M and NiV-B range from 92 to 100%.[16] In Bangladesh, genetic heterogeneity in human isolates suggests multiple introductions of NiV in the human population from different colonies of fruit bats.",

A seroepidemiologic study in Malaysia implicated four fruit bat species, Pteropus hypomelanus, Pteropus vampyrus, Cynopterus brachyotis, Eonycteris spelaea, and an insectivorous bat, Scotophilus kuhlii.[17] NiV has been isolated from the brain and spinal fluid of victims in Malaysia.[18] Infective virus has also been isolated from environmental samples of bat urine and partially eaten fruit in Malaysia.[19] Given the distribution of the locally abundant fruit bats in South Asia, NiV outbreaks are likely to continue to occur in affected countries. The bats are migratory.[20] This has generated intensive surveillance for evidence of NiV infection in bats in these countries. Evidence of NiV could be demonstrated in Pisaster giganteus in Bangladesh.[21] NiV has been isolated from Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Cambodia[22] and viral RNA found in urine and saliva from Pteropus lylei and Horsfield's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros larvatus) in Thailand.[23] Antibodies to a Nipah-like virus have been found in sera from fruit bats collected in India, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste.[24] The status of NiV infection in other countries of the Southeast Asia region is not known.",

As the flying fox habitat is destroyed by human activity, the bats get stressed and hungry, their immune system gets weaker, their virus load goes up, and a lot of virus spills out in their urine and saliva.[26] Similar fluctuation of virus shedding may be associated with the stressful physiological conditions or seasons. Evidence of seasonal preference of transmission in P. lylei was recently demonstrated in a study in Thailand. The period April\u2013June was the time (highest in May) when viral RNA could be mainly detected in urine, which was associated with a fluctuation of population numbers that was observed only in May and correlated with young bats leaving to fly.",

Drinking of fresh date palm sap, possibly contaminated by fruit bats (P. giganteus) during the winter season, may have been responsible for indirect transmission of NiV to humans.[27] The consumption of date palm sap (which is also known as toddy, kallu, tuak, and tuba in other countries) is popular in a number of Southeast Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Thailand as well as countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines. Fruit bats also consume date palm sap and can contaminate it with saliva, urine, and faeces. This is the means by which NiV is thought to be transmitted from infected fruit bats to humans.[28] There is circumstantial evidence of human-to-human transmission in India in 2001. During the outbreak in Siliguri, 33 health workers and hospital visitors became ill after exposure to patients hospitalized with NiV illness, suggesting nosocomial infection.[29] During the Bangladesh outbreak, the virus is suggested to have been transmitted either directly or indirectly from infected bats to humans. Strong evidence indicative of human-to-human transmission of NiV was found in Bangladesh in 2004. The various modes of transmission are described below in Figure 2.[30]",

Appropriate steps to contain this virus have been taken among domestic animals such as pigs.[44] All the contacts are under observation and steps to avoid exposure through animal vectors have been taken and efforts are in place to reduce the panic created by social media by educating people that NiV is not an airborne infection and there is no risk of contracting disease without coming in contact with an infected person.",
