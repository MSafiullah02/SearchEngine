In China, poor self-rated health status during the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with increased depression and anxiety, especially for those with chronic medical comorbidities. 3 Moreover, clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 are also at high risk for developing anxiety and depression during this crisis. 4 SNF and psychiatric center staff are clearly stressed: they are caring for vulnerable patients, navigating ever-evolving isolation precaution regulations, and worrying about the risk that their job poses to their own and loved ones' health. Prior to COVID-19, SNF staff were identified as being at greater risk of burnout than peers in other settings and in need of educational support. 5 With these factors in mind, we decided to offer assistance to SNFs and collaborating psychiatric centers engaged in the University of Rochester Geriatric Telepsychiatry Program.",

Sixty-seven participants, representing 7 SNFs, 11 psychiatric centers, and 3 other organizations joined the videoconference and 61 participants reprsenting10 SNFs and 3 major organizations joined another. For the first 20 minutes, we delivered a didactic on the increased risk of delirium in isolation and provided recommendations to monitor and evaluate for delirium. In the following 40 minutes, we facilitated a discussion to explore interventions to reduce loneliness and isolation in a safe and physically distanced way and acknowledge the challenges that facilities were encountering and their approaches for addressing them. Within this forum, individuals and teams shared their personal reflections regarding the emotional struggles of their work. Themes of anxiety for their patients, their personal safety, and that of their loved ones emerged. They exchanged ideas on how they were coping and still supporting one another even when working remotely. We validated these ideas and efforts while also noting the importance of self-care in order to successfully maintain the wellbeing of their patients.",

As this initiative is part of a larger service through our institution, we are continuously engaged in program evaluation and collecting data regarding our participants' learning experience. Evaluation of this and similar efforts, modified based on the scope and scale of the program, could include: 1) pre-/post-test changes in the SNF participants' wellbeing as well as competency in the reviewed didactic areas, 2) whether the participants' SNFs had implemented strategies from the didactic sessions for SNF patients referred for psychiatric consultation, and 3) SNF assessment data (e.g., depressive symptoms and aggressive behaviors) from the Minimum Data Set.",
