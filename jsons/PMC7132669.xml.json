During the outbreak, 186 patients were confirmed to have MERS, of which 37 died.1, 2 Isolated strains were typed as clade B MERS-coronavirus (CoV) and were closely related to the viruses circulating in the Middle East.3 The distinct feature of the MERS outbreak in South Korea was that the transmission was hospital-related, with transmission within the hospital and from hospital to hospital, resulting in the exposure of a high number of health care personnel (HCP) to MERS-CoV.4 In general, HCP form a considerable proportion of confirmed MERS cases as observed during previous outbreaks. In the 2014 outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 81 of 255 patients (31%) were HCP.5 In the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, 30 of 166 confirmed patients (18%) were HCP.6\n",

A total of 30 of 186 confirmed MERS patients were referred to the NMC from May-July in 2015. During this period, the NMC instituted a screening clinic for HCP involved in MERS patient care to ensure rapid detection, isolation, and management of HCP who were possibly infected with MERS. The aim of this study was to review the HCP who visited the screening clinic for MERS-related symptoms or exposure events. Additionally, we compared the data of this HCP group with the results of the postoutbreak survey and interviews focusing on the overall HCP population that participated in MERS patient care.",

When the exposure risk was higher because of aerosol-generating procedures or mechanical ventilator care, HCP wore inner and outer gloves, an impermeable coverall, a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) with external belt-mounted blower, a full face shield (hood), inner and outer boot covers, and an apron.13 PPE was single-use and disposable, except some units of PAPR. Because only sparse data from Saudi Arabia were available regarding the transmission of MERS-CoV within health care facilities, the NMC adopted a higher infection precaution level than that generally recommended.",

Therefore, the MERS screening clinic (MSC) in the NMC was operated solely for HCP with MERS-related symptoms. Few non-HCP visitors for MERS-like symptoms were managed in a separate section of the emergency room. Retrospective chart review of clinical and laboratory data was performed for HCP who visited the MSC because of MERS-like symptoms or accidental exposure to MERS patients without appropriate PPE. As previously mentioned, tympanic temperature measurements and checkups for MERS-like symptoms were performed regularly. When an HCP developed clinical features suggestive of MERS (fever \u226537.5\u00b0C or respiratory symptoms) and had contact with MERS patients within 2 weeks before symptom onset, the chief infection control officer quarantined the HCP to their home or an isolated room in the hospital according to the guidelines of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Droplet precaution was applied during the quarantine, and a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was sent to the Korea National Institute of Health for MERS-CoV reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. If the first test result was negative, a second test was performed 48 hours later. If both consecutive tests were negative, the quarantine was released.",

These questionnaire survey data were used in this study. Informed consent was obtained from all HCP who agreed to participate in the serosurvey. To investigate the risk factors for exposure to MERS, HCP participants were asked to answer the questionnaire covering the following items: type and length of contact with confirmed MERS patients, places of duty within the hospital, PPE status, exposure events without appropriate PPE, and symptoms possibly related with MERS infection that developed during the care of MERS patients. If the subject answered that they had been exposed without appropriate PPE in the questionnaire, and the HCP had not visited the MSC during the outbreak, we conducted a detailed questionnaire on the exposure events.

Our institution focused on instructing HCP to notify the infection control officers as soon as they experienced MERS-like symptoms or exposure to a patient without appropriate PPE during the MERS outbreak. However, a substantial proportion of HCP did not take appropriate action, such as visiting the MSC, despite experiencing MERS-related symptoms or potential exposure. During the in-depth interview about exposure events, most HCP stated that the reason for not notifying the infection control officer was that by their judgment, the patient was not infectious when the exposure occurred. Although the actual risk of infection was very low in most exposure events, it is not recommended that the HCP determine the infectivity of a quarantined patient by themselves. In addition, one HCP replied that she tried to obtain a sputum sample through oropharyngeal catheter suction from a patient with poor sputum expectoration capacity. Although she was aware that it might provoke coughing, she only wore an N95 respirator against the recommendation of using PAPR during the procedure, which may cause aerosol generation. During the in-depth interview, she replied that she was reluctant to notify the event to the hospital authority worried about the limited HCP capacity during the outbreak situation. Although abiding by the infection precaution is most important, HCP should be educated to notify hospital authorities promptly if unprotected exposure occurs.",

Therefore, the risk of unrecognized exposure may have been minimal and the actual situation may be different according to the role of an institution during the outbreak situation. Second, our data regarding the MSC are based on the HCP who visited the MSC. As observed in our postoutbreak survey, some HCP may not have visited the MSC even though they had experienced MERS-related symptoms. Third, although most HCP replied that the reason for not notifying their exposure event to the infection control officer was that they judged the patient as not infectious, we could not determine the actual infectivity because most HCP could not recall the involved patients. However, despite these limitations, there was no evidence in the postoutbreak serosurvey that HCP had been infected with MERS during patient care in the NMC. We think our experience may be helpful for developing strategies in the situation of an emerging infectious diseases outbreak.",

Because HCP are a group at high risk for MERS-CoV infection, it is important to develop and institute an effective screening plan to ensure prompt detection and management of HCP with MERS-related events. This plan may be achieved by educating HCP to accurately recognize the risk situation and immediately notify the hospital authorities regarding symptom occurrence or potential exposure.",
