Severity assessment: The severity of CAP is assessed according to the various severity scores e.g. Pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB-65, CRB-65, 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) criteria for ICU admission for CAP (a) Pneumonia severity index (PSI): It has moderate to good accuracy in predicting the 30 day mortality in patients with CAP. Points are given for age, gender, co-morbid illness, physical examination findings, ABG analysis, blood chemistry, hematocrit and chest X-ray findings and score is calculated. Patients are classified as PSI I to V according to their final score with mortality ranging from 0.1% to 27% respectively. It has superior ability to detect low risk patients. PSI I & II can be managed as an outpatient whereas IV and V needs hospitalisation (b) CURB-65: It consists of 5 core elements (new onset Confusion, Urea > 20 mg/ dl, RR > 30 bpm, SBP < 90 mmHg or DBP < 60 mmHg, Age 65 years or older, 1 point each for a total of 5). CURB 65 of 0 can be managed as outpatient, CURB 65 1&2 generally require ward treatment and a score of 3 or more warrants inpatient and aggressive treatment, usually in the ICU. It has superior ability to detect high risk patients. A simpler version of this score the CRB-65, does away with urea measurement without losing it effectiveness to detect high risk patients. Some studies have suggested an age group of \u2265 80 years (CRB-80) to have better predictability for mortality. (c) 2007 ATS/IDSA criteria for ICU admission for CAP: It consists of 2 major (invasive mechanical ventilation, septic shock requiring vasopressors) and 9 minor criteria (confusion, RR > 30 bpm, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 249, multilobar infiltrates, BUN>20 mg/dL, WBC < 4000/mm 3 , platelet count<1,000,000/ mm 3 , temperature < 36 \u00b0C, hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation).
