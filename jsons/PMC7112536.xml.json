Recently, Chan et al. studied neopterin concentrations in 110 patients with acute Dengue Fever (DF).17 They found higher neopterin concentrations in acute DF sera compared with those in measles and influenza and in healthy controls. Baize et al. studied inflammatory mediators in patients with Ebola hemorrhagic fever during two recent outbreaks in Gabon.19 They also found higher levels of serum neopterin concentrations compared to controls. In the current study, we found increased serum neopterin levels in CCHF patients after admission to hospital. Since the mean time for hospital admission was approximately same for both fatal (6 \u00b1 5.8 days) and nonfatal (5.8 \u00b1 3.0 days) groups in the current study, measurements \u2018on the first day of admission of patients to the hospital\u2019 were practical and appropriate to compare both groups. The mean serum neopterin concentration in CCHF patients exceeded that of the controls by approximately 15-fold. According to our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to evaluate neopterin levels in CCHF patients. The very high serum neopterin levels may suggest that monocytes/macrophages are strongly activated during CCHF infection.

The mean concentration of neopterin in the patients with fatal CCHF disease was nearly threefold higher than that of nonfatal CCHF disease. The mean concentrations of neopterin before death in patients with fatal CCHF disease were even higher than the mean serum neopterin of the first day of hospitalization. However, the levels of neopterin decreased to lower levels in patients with nonfatal CCHF. This shows that those CCHF patients with lower neopterin concentrations are more likely to recover than others. High serum neopterin levels in fatal patients may reflect severe inflammation and intense activation of cell-mediated immune response in severe CCHF disease. Recently, in another study we found that viral load \u22651 \u00d7 109 RNA copies/ml could be considered to predict a fatal outcome in CCHF disease.24 Together with viral load, neopterin could be a measure of the severity of CCHF disease.",

Different predictors of fatality were reported as risk factors for CCHF2, 5, 6 and those previously defined severity criteria were not completely consistent with each other. Among these parameters decreased platelet count, prolonged aPTT, elevated AST and ALT levels were common in the univariate analysis of three different studies. In multivariate analysis only ALT,6 and existence of somnolence, melena, prolonged aPTT and decreased platelet count5 were predictors of fatality. In the current study, bleeding, decreased platelet count, elevated neopterin, AST and LDH were identified as predictors of fatality in univariate analysis. In our multivariate analysis, only serum neopterin level was associated with fatal outcome. Further studies including larger number of patients are necessary to clarify these inconsistencies.",
