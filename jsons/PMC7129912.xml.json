Eur.) monographs and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Manual [4] (Fig. 1\n).

Since 2007, 12 batches of live Aujeszky's disease vaccines have been tested for Pestivirus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in the framework of the Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR). In addition to OCABR testing, random tests were carried out on 27 batches of seven different vaccines against porcine parvovirosis, swine erysipelas, IBR, PRRS, canine parvovirosis and feline panleukopenia used in Hungary between 2007 and 2009. In addition, 27 poultry vaccines, from eight different manufacturers, used in Hungary between 1996 and 2009 were randomly selected and examined by PCR for the presence of chicken anaemia virus (CAV) and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV). A total of 35 different vaccines, including all poultry vaccines mentioned above, were tested for TTV (Table 1\n).
