A rapid and highly sensitive detection and quantification method for TSV and YHV was developed using the GeneAmp \u00ae 5700 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green chemistry. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mixture contained a fluorescent dye, SYBR Green, which exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon binding to double strand cDNA. The enhancement of fluorescence was found to be proportional to the initial concentration of the template cDNA. A linear relationship was observed between input plasmid DNA and cycle threshold (C T ) values for 10 6 down to a single copy of both viruses. To control for the variation in sample processing and in reverse transcription reaction among samples, shrimp b-actin and elongation factor-1a (EF-1a) genes were amplified in parallel with the viral cDNA. The sensitivity and the efficiency of amplification of EF-1a was greater than b-actin when compared to TSV and YHV amplification efficiency suggesting that EF-1a is a better internal control for the RT-PCR detection of TSV and YHV. In addition, sample to sample variation in EF-1a C T value was lower than the variation in b-actin C T value of the corresponding samples. The specificity of TSV, YHV, EF-1a and b-actin amplifications was confirmed by analyzing the dissociation curves of the target amplicon. The C T values of TSV and YHV samples were normalized against EF-1a C T values for determining the absolute copy number from the standard curve of the corresponding virus.

From late 1998 to early 1999, TSV epizootics were recorded in Taiwan that was attributed to the introduction of TSV contaminated postlarvae and spawners from Ecuador and elsewhere in the Latin America to Taiwan (Tu et al., 1999) . To prevent the spread of viral epizootics and to monitor the movement of live and frozen shrimp among countries and continents, there is a growing and urgent need to develop rapid and highly sensitive detection methods. The real-time RT-PCR described here is highly sensitive. It is capable of detecting up to a single copy equivalent of the TSV or the YHV genome (Fig. 1) . In SYBR Green RT-PCR, it takes 40 cycles (C T = 40) to detect a single copy of a viral genome (Perkin Elmer User Manual, GeneAmp \u00ae 5700 Sequence Detection System, User Manual, 1998) . A linear relationship between the input plasmid DNA and the C T values was observed from 10 6 down to a single copy of both TSV and YHV. Detection of viruses over such a large dynamic range is useful for measuring the viral load in animals with different levels of infection. Thus SYBR Green RT-PCR provides a continuous scale for measuring the viral load. In addition, since SYBR Green RT-PCR is capable of detecting a single copy of viral genome, it will be useful to detect sub-clinical infections. Due to exquisite sensitivity of SYBR Green PCR, it is highly susceptible to PCR carry over or other contamination. Therefore, laboratory hygiene practices should be followed very strictly to pre-vent any potential contamination that may give false positive result. In addition, any negative result as well as samples with C T values close to 40 should be tested at least twice for confirmation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 362, "end": 385, "text": "(Lightner et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 690, "end": 707, "text": "(Tu et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1266, "text": "(Perkin Elmer User Manual, GeneAmp \u00ae 5700 Sequence Detection System, User Manual, 1998)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1074, "end": 1082, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The SYBR Green RT-PCR was not only highly sensitive but also very specific for detecting TSV, YHV and the internal control genes, EF-1a and b-actin. The specificity of SYBR Green RT-PCR was determined by monitoring the amplification profile and the dissociation curve of the target amplicons. In SYBR Green RT-PCR, a sample is considered positive when the amplification plot crosses the threshold value. For example, in Fig.  3A the amplification plot of TSV infected sample exceeds the threshold value at cycle number 31.45 whereas the amplification plot of the healthy sample did not exceed the threshold line. To ensure that the amplification plot obtained for TSV infected sample was indeed due to the amplification of TSV specific product, the dissociation curve of the product was analyzed (Fig. 3B ). Since the dissociation curve of a product depends on its GC content, length and sequence composition; amplification of a specific versus non-specific product could be differentiated by examining the dissociation curve. The TSV amplicon provided a dissociation curve with a single peak at 72.0\u00b0C which is expected for the TSV specific amplicon. To determine the quality and any variation in the amount of input RNA as well as the efficiency of the reverse transcriptase reaction in both healthy and TSV infected samples, EF-1a and b-actin genes were amplified in parallel to the target virus. Both healthy and TSV infected samples provided successful amplification of EF-1a and b-actin genes with the dissociation curve showing a single peak at the expected temperature (T m for EF-1a was 79.2\u00b0C and T m for b-actin was 78.8\u00b0C, Fig.  3C -F).

It takes about 2 h to run a 96 well plate from the time the plate is put into the instrument. After amplification, the data analysis takes a few minutes. In a 96 well plate, 22 samples can be run at a time with two replicates for each virus sample, internal control, positive control and negative control. Thus, SYBR Green RT-PCR can be used for high throughput assays for YHV and TSV detection. In recent years, real-time RT-PCR based on TaqMan chemistry, has been used for the detection of RNA viruses infecting plants (Roberts et al., 2000) , animals (Moody et al., 2000; Komurian-Pradel et al., 2001; Oleksiewicz et al., 2001) and to quantitate cellular transcripts in yeast and mammals (Kang et al., 2000; Leutenegger et al., 1999; Schmittgen et al., 2000) .

Both real-time RT-PCR methods produced a 4-to 5-log dynamic range of amplification compared to 1-log dynamic range for endpoint RT-PCR. They reported that although both real-time RT-PCR methods provided comparable dynamic range and sensitivity, SYBR Green detection was more precise and produced a more linear decay plot than the TaqMan detection system. In contrast to SYBR Green detection, multiple fluorogenic probes can be used in a TaqMan assay to detect more than one target in a reaction.

We compared the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of EF-1a and b-actin to that of TSV and YHV to determine which of these two genes could serve as a better internal reference. Ideally, the amplification efficiency as well as the sensitivity of an internal control should be comparable to the RNA under study and the internal control should be expressed at an equivalent level irrespective of tissue used, stages of development and the experimental treatments (Bustin, 2000) . The sensitivity (Y intercepts) and amplification efficiency (slope) of EF-1a was greater than b-actin when compared to both TSV and YHV amplification. For example, the sensitivity (Y intercept 39.765) and amplification efficiency (slope \u22123.582) of TSV was more similar to EF-1a (Y intercepts 40.121, slope \u2212 3.443) than b-actin (Y intercepts 34.984 and slope \u22122.749) ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, the slope and the intercepts of YHV curve were more similar to the EF-1a than b-actin (Fig.  2B ). There is considerable evidence that the bactin transcription varies widely in response to experimental treatment in human breast epithelial cells, porcine tissues and canine myocardium (reviewed in Bustin, 2000) . In the current study, Both EF-1a and b-actin showed variation in their level of expression in TSV and YHV in-fected samples.
