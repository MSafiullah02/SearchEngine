This evaluation is fundamental to make authorities aware about spreading characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV2 in the Italian population and to earn insightful clues about the presumptive hypothesis that the current viral spreading in Italy surely comes from a Wuhan\u2010borne genotype and/or a Chinese outbreak. The same authors concluded that the SARS\u2010CoV2 in Italy might be present at least since September and October 2019, much before the claimed Wuhan outbreak.\n1\n According to the World Health Organization evaluation, SARS\u2010CoV2 outbreaks in Europe occurred much before in Germany and France respect to Italy. Therefore, it might be presumed that a significant proportion of Italians were infected by SARS\u2010CoV2 in times greatly preceding the Government dispositions upon the cases enumeration. The daily differences between cases in the highest emergence period, that is, 1 to 9 March 2020, plotted a linear rather than an exponential trend. As x increases (1 day each), y values (cases number) increases by the same amount (1.2 or +20%) (Shapiro\u2010Wilk's exp test P = .442857). This possibly suggests that rhinopharyngeal swabs are catching homogeneous clusters of cases from dating back homogeneously, normally distributed preinfected population, depending also on an established maximal number of analyzed swabs for the day.",

As regards RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, the nucleotide mutation rate is at least a million times higher respect to a vertebrate, frequently recombine their genomes, between animals and humans, and are therefore highly pushed by evolutionary selection to adapt and survive in the animal\u2010human coexisting population.\n3\n This should suggest that the cross\u2010talk between evolution and epidemiology is closely intertwined, causing that the maintenance of an onward transmission might be crucially associated with a continuous viral adaptation.",
