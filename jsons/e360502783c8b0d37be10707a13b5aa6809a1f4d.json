The most common clinical presentation is respiratory symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough associated with radiographical findings consistent with pneumonia (2) . The prevalence of abnormal liver tests on the initial presentation of COVID-19 is still undetermined. Currently, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19 other than supportive care, enrollment in clinical trials, and the use of off-label therapies such as vitamin C and hydroxychloroquine without supportive, randomized clinical trials to support their efficacy. We report our first case of COVID-19 presenting as acute, nonicteric hepatitis.",

She had a medical history of well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus (CD4 499 and viral load undetectable), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Graves disease, and a left facial paralysis secondary to previous actinomycosis infection. She denied recent intake of acetaminophen or any antibiotics. Her outpatient medications included clonidine, fish oil, levothyroxine, amlodipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, MVI, and Genvoya (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide). Recent outpatient liver chemistries were normal. She was admitted because of the concern of rising liver tests in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus disease.",
