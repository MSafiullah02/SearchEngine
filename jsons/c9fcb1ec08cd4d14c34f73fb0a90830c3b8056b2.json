            "text": "For more than two decades, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has been considered a paradigm of disease vulnerability associated with low genetic diversity, particularly at the immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Cheetahs have been used as a classic example in numerous conservation genetics textbooks as well as in many related scientific publications. However, earlier studies used methods with low resolution to quantify MHC diversity and/or small sample sizes. Furthermore, high disease susceptibility was reported only for captive cheetahs, whereas free-ranging cheetahs show no signs of infectious diseases and a good general health status. We examined whether the diversity at MHC class I and class II-DRB loci in 149 Namibian cheetahs was higher than previously reported using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, cloning, and sequencing. MHC genes were examined at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. We detected ten MHC class I and four class II-DRB alleles, of which nine MHC class I and all class II-DRB alleles were expressed. Phylogenetic analyses and individual genotypes suggested that the alleles belong to four MHC class I and three class II-DRB putative loci. Evidence of positive selection was detected in both MHC loci. Our study indicated that the low number of MHC class I alleles previously observed in cheetahs was due to a smaller sample size examined. On the other hand, the low number of MHC class II-DRB alleles previously observed in cheetahs was further confirmed. Compared with other mammalian species including felids, cheetahs showed low levels of MHC diversity, but this does not seem to influence the immunocompetence of free-ranging cheetahs in Namibia and contradicts the previous conclusion that the cheetah is a paradigm species of disease vulnerability.",

            "text": "Host genetic diversity plays an important role in buffering populations against widespread epidemics (Altizer et al. 2003) . Nevertheless, there are an increasing number of species for which the extent of genetic variability and the ability to respond to diseases or environmental changes differs markedly from expectations (Amos and Harwood 1998) . Immunocompetence is influenced by genetic factors such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and environmental factors (Frankham et al. 2002) . MHC genes are responsible for the adaptive immune response in vertebrates and are thereby involved in modulating host resistance to emerging pathogens (Hill 1998) . They encode MHC class I (MHC I) and MHC class II (MHC II) cell-surface glycoproteins that bind and present intracellular (e.g., virus) and extracellular (e.g., bacteria) foreign peptides, respectively, to T-cell receptors to elicit an adequate immune response (Doherty and Zinkernagel 1975) . Very high patterns of diversity at MHC loci among vertebrates (Garrigan and Hedrick 2003; Sommer 2005; Piertney and Oliver 2006) are interpreted as an adaptation to detect and present a wide array of peptides from rapidly evolving pathogens (Yuhki and O'Brien 1990b) . Consequently, MHC diversity could be the ultimate response to selection in the face of unpredictable or temporally varying disease outbreaks (Altizer et al. 2003) . Balancing selection is suggested to maintain variation at MHC loci (Hedrick 1994 ) driven mainly by pathogenic (Hedrick 2002a ) and reproductive selective pressures (Sommer et al. 2002) .",

By contrast, bottlenecked populations of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis aries) are highly susceptible to many infectious diseases despite showing high levels of MHC diversity (Gutierrez-Espeleta et al. 2001) . Therefore, the influence of the extent of MHC diversity on the ability to respond to pathogenic challenges and, consequently, to the viability and survival of bottlenecked populations is not conclusive and still unclear (Edwards and Potts 1996; Hedrick 2003b; Radwan et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "Low genetic diversity particularly at MHC loci has been associated with high susceptibility to infectious diseases in cheetahs (O'Brien et al. 1985 (O'Brien et al. , 1986 O'Brien and Evermann 1988) . However, increased susceptibility has only been observed in captive cheetahs Heeney et al. 1990 ), whereas free-ranging cheetahs from Eastern and Southern Africa show robust health (Caro 1994; Munson et al. 2004 Munson et al. , 2005 Thalwitzer et al. 2010) . In Namibia, where the largest free-ranging cheetah population in the world occurs (Marker-Kraus et al. 1996) , recent studies on seroprevalence and necropsies have shown no clinical symptoms of acute viral diseases in cheetahs and a good general health status (Munson et al. , 2005 Thalwitzer et al. 2010) . This suggests that the immunocompetence of this cheetah population is not limited by their capacity to respond effectively to viral challenges (Thalwitzer et al. 2010) and that the observed difference in immunocompetence between captive and free-ranging cheetahs might be a consequence of unfavorable husbandry conditions resulting in stress and reduced immunocompetence, as previously suggested (Caro and Laurenson 1994; Merola 1994) . The apparent robust immunocompetence of freeranging Namibian cheetahs, however, still raises the question whether this population has a higher level of MHC diversity than previously observed (Drake et al. 2004) or than reported from other cheetah populations (Yuhki and O'Brien 1990b) , or whether the cheetah in its natural environment represents an example of a species with low MHC variability and yet low disease susceptibility.",

Domestic cat Felis catus MHC I and II-DRB sequences (Gen-Bank accession number EU153401) were used as outgroups. First, ML trees were generated using PAUP 4.0 beta version (Swofford 2002) . The implemented MODELT-EST 3.7 (Posada and Crandall 1998) was applied to choose a model and the estimated parameters that explained best the nucleotide sequence evolution of the data. The likelihood settings for both MHC I and II-DRB alleles corresponded to the model GTR \u00fe C (general time-reversible \u00fe gamma distribution of rates with four categories). The robustness of the ML tree was estimated through 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Second, we adopted a Bayesian inference approach using Mr. Bayes 3.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) . For MHC I, we generated partitioned Bayesian analyses (Brandley et al. 2005; Monaghan et al. 2007 ) by separating the combined matrix into seven partitions based on the individual mode of evolution of each codon position at the coding (exon 2 and exon 3) and noncoding (intron 2) regions. A nonpartition Bayesian analysis (all data in a single partition) was also conducted for comparison purposes. In both partition and nonpartition analyses, tree searches were conducted using a GTR \u00fe invariable \u00fe C model and its estimated parameter values. Each Bayesian phylogenetic analysis consisted of 5 \u00c2 10 6 generations with a random starting tree, default priors and two runs of four heated and one cold Markov chains (heating 5 0.20) sampled every 1,000 generations. A burn-in of 1.25 \u00c2 10 6 generations was selected based on the average standard deviation of split frequencies as well as by plotting \u00c0lnL against generation time. The MHC II-DRB alleles represented a single coding (exon 2) region; therefore, we conducted regular Bayesian analyses (no partition) using the same settings as described above.",

The number of unique sequences observed per individual ranged from four to six, indicating that at least three MHC I loci were amplified. All genomic DNA sequences except for Acju-MHCI*12 were also observed in cDNA, validating their expression and functionality. The sequence Acju-MHCI*12 showed two insertions in exon 3 that changed the open reading frame of the transcript sequence.

Overall mean genetic distances (\u00b1 standard errors) of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of expressed MHC I (nine) and MHC II-DRB (four) alleles in 108 and 139 Namibian cheetahs, respectively. MBE individuals were sampled across the country, we assume that the number of alleles observed in this study represent largely the extent of MHC variation in Namibian cheetahs. The expression of all but one observed MHC alleles confirmed their adaptive functionality. We detected ten MHC I alleles in 108 Namibian cheetahs. The observed MHC I diversity in terms of the number of alleles is higher compared with a previous study of the species (two alleles detected in two individuals; Yuhki and O'Brien 1994) . This difference is clearly because of the larger number of individuals analyzed in this study. The number of MHC I alleles that occurred in the Namibian cheetah population was still relatively low compared with other natural populations of mammalian species (table 3) . In felids, a total of 52 alleles were detected in 25 lions from an Asiatic and Afro-Asiatic hybrid population in India (Sachdev et al. 2005) . However, the criteria of the authors to accept clone sequences as true alleles did not follow a conservative approach and thereby we cannot exclude the possibility that the allele diversity in the 25 lions was overestimated. Recently, a total of 14 alleles were detected in only 14 Bengal tigers from India (Pokorny et al. 2010) . Despite differences in the number of alleles among all populations of felid species, the overall nucleotide diversity, rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions along all sites of the second exon of MHC I alleles were similar (Table 3) .",

Drake et al. (2004) identified an extra allele (GenBank accession number AY312964) in a single individual, which was not present in any of the individuals we genotyped. Thus, we confirmed the previously observed low levels of MHC II-DRB diversity in cheetahs. Table 2 . Nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) substitutions (\u00b1 standard error) as well as their ratio in ABS and non-ABS assuming concordance with the human MHC I and MHC II-DRB sequences (Bjorkman and Parham 1993; Brown et al. 1993 Immune Gene Diversity in Namibian Cheetahs \u00b7 doi:10.1093/molbev/msq330 MBE Compared with other natural populations of mammalian species, the number of MHC II-DRB alleles detected in cheetahs was also low (Table 3) . However, the nucleotide diversity with only four MHC II-DRB alleles in cheetahs was similar to other felids and relatively high compared with other canids that showed even more alleles. Contrary to canids and other noncarnivore species (including rodents and primates), felids showed higher rates of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitutions in all sites of the second exon of MHC II-DRB alleles (table 3) . This is remarkable as most natural populations of vertebrates show an opposite pattern (Bernatchez and Landry 2003) . The comparison of MHC variation between populations of different species must be interpreted carefully because the extent of MHC polymorphism varies strongly among and between different taxonomic orders of mammalian populations (Kelley et al. 2005) , probably related to their demographic history, degree of admixture, and selective factors. In addition, the number of detected alleles is influenced by the sample size, the number of populations analyzed, and the number of MHC loci investigated. Therefore, such aspects should be considered in comparative analyses of MHC diversity among populations from different species.",

The distribution of genetic variation along the MHC I transcripts in Namibian cheetahs revealed a higher amino acid divergence at the a 1 domain (14%) compared with the a 2 domain (9%; table 1). Most of the functional variation was concentrated in the second half of the a 1 domain, whereas the substitutions in the a 2 domain were dispersed. This pattern is consistent with MHC I transcripts from other felids (e.g., domestic cat, ocelot, Asiatic lion; O'Brien 1990a, 1994; Sachdev et al. 2005) . Noncoding regions evolving under neutral conditions can be expected to exhibit high genetic polymorphism. The noncoding intronic sequences between the second and third exons of MHC I loci, however, revealed a low diversity (3%; table 1). This is because noncoding regions in close proximity to regions evolving under strong selection are homogenized over evolutionary time by the results of recombination and subsequent genetic drift (Hughes 2000) .

Nonsynonymous substitutions were more frequently observed in the ABS than in the non-ABS, indicating that selection was likely acting upon ABS at least in historical times. Whereas similar results were obtained for the Eurasian lynx (Wang et al. 2009 ) and Bengal tiger (Pokorny et al. 2010) , this variation pattern is rare in MHC II-DRB loci. Most mammalian populations living under natural conditions show significant higher rates of d N compared with d S in ABS (Bernatchez and Landry 2003; Sommer 2005) including the domestic cat (Yuhki and O'Brien 1997) . It is unlikely that pseudogenes led to higher d S and biased the d N :d S ratio (Satta 1993) because we confirmed the expression of all DRB alleles. Another explanation might be that the ABS in A. jubatus MHC II-DRB molecules are different from those in humans. However, analyses of the sequence variation of MHC I and II-DRB transcripts conducted in other felid species showed similar ABS locations as in human molecules (Yuhki et al. 1989; Yuhki and O'Brien 1994) .",

A more detailed study on the patterns of neutral diversity using 38 microsatellite loci in 89 cheetahs throughout Namibia revealed 3 to 10 alleles per locus, with no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The limited differentiation among the geographical regions suggests that the Namibian cheetahs form a large panmictic population (Marker et al. 2008) . Our study on the adaptive MHC loci conducted in the same cheetah population revealed ten MHC I alleles with one to five alleles per locus and four MHC II-DRB alleles with one or two alleles per locus. The preservation of few but highly divergent and functional MHC I and II-DRB alleles that survived the bottleneck could be interpreted as balancing selection shaping MHC diversity in the current population (Hedrick 2003b , but see Ejsmond and Radwan 2009 ). This pattern is consistent with the mechanism of divergent allele advantage ) because high divergence among alleles can result in a wider array of pathogen-derived antigens being recognized by the host population. Thus, the low levels of MHC I and II-DRB diversity observed in the Namibian cheetah population can be attributed to demographic processes rather than an absence of or reduced selection on MHC. Other examples of bottlenecked mammalian populations that showed the same pattern include carnivores (e.g., red wolf Canis rufus, Hedrick et al. 2002b Radwan et al. 2007) , and rodents (Malagasy giant rat, Hypogeomys antimena, Sommer 2003; Eurasian beaver, C. fiber, Babik et al. 2005) .",

Assuming that 3,100 Namibian cheetahs represent the lowest population estimate (Hanssen and Stander 2004) , that approximately half of the individuals are breeding adults, and that there is an equal sex ratio, an empirical estimate of the current effective population size N e 5 1,550 cheetahs (Storz et al. 2002) . However, because N e can reach 1/10 of the census size in wildlife populations (Frankham 1995a) , we must consider a lower limit of N e 5 310 cheetahs. The fixation of a neutral nuclear gene is expected after 4N e generations (Nichols 2001) , which represents some 1,240\u00c0 6,200 generations or 2,976\u00c014,880 years according to a generation time of 2.4 years in the cheetah (Kelly et al. 1998) .

            "text": "The extent of genetic diversity required to ensure the longterm viability of the natural population remains a fundamental question in conservation genetics (Miller and Lambert 2004) . A number of studies have indicated that bottlenecked populations exhibit a highly reduced MHC I and II variation and predicted that these populations have a low immune adaptability and a high risk for disease outbreaks and extinction (Frankham 1995b; O'Brien and Evermann 1988) . However, the effect of reduced MHC variation on the long-term viability of bottlenecked populations has remained unclear (reviewed in Radwan et al. 2010) . MHCbased studies have been useful in explaining some of the variation in disease resistance in free-ranging animal populations (Sommer 2005) . Nevertheless, few studies on bottlenecked populations have associated levels of MHC diversity with the occurrence of diseases. For example, O'Brien et al. (1985; 1986 ) associated an outbreak of FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) in a captive population of cheetahs with the lack of variation at MHC loci measured indirectly by calculating the time of allograft rejection between unrelated cheetahs. Siddle et al. (2007) assumed an increased susceptibility to DFTD (devil facial tumor disease) in a free-ranging bottlenecked population of Tasmanian devils Sarcophilus harrisii because of the loss of MHC I diversity. By contrast, Giese and Hedrick (2003) found no evidence of MHC heterozygosity associated with mortality caused by a novel pathogen in the endangered Gila topminnow Poeciliopsis occidentalis. Mainguy et al. (2007) did not observe an increased susceptibility to disease in a bottlenecked population of Canadian mountain goats Oreamnos americanus in which only two MHC II-DRB alleles were retained. Castro-Prieto et al. \u00b7 doi:10.1093/molbev/msq330 MBE The results from this study also suggest that low levels of MHC variation observed in the Namibian cheetah population do not limit or compromise their immunocompetence against (infectious) diseases. This population tested seropositive for feline calcivirus (FCV), feline parvovirus (FPV), feline herpesvirus, canine distemper virus (CDV), feline corona virus (FCoV), and rabies with high seropositivity in the northern part of the population; 65% and 48% of the investigated cheetahs were seropositive against FCV and FPV, respectively Thalwitzer et al. 2010) . Despite seropositivity for several viruses, no clinical or pathological evidence for infectious diseases were detected in living or dead cheetahs (Munson et al. , 2005 Thalwitzer et al. 2010) . The social structure of cheetahs with small group sizes or solitary individuals (Caro 1994 ) prevents a high rate of pathogen transmission and reinfection; however, transmission of, for example, FPV, FCoV, and CDV is facilitated through indirect contact at marking trees where cheetahs deposit feces (Marker-Kraus et al. 1996; Thalwitzer et al. 2010) . Also, interspecific virus transmission might occur via free-ranging or domestic nonvaccinated carnivore species acting as pathogen reservoirs that potentially come into contact with free-ranging cheetahs in the Namibian farmlands (Thalwitzer et al. 2010) .",

The long-term survival of free-ranging cheetahs in Namibia seems more likely to depend on human-induced rather than genetic factors. However, it cannot be ruled out that levels of MHC variation observed in the Namibian cheetahs might limit a prosperous immunocompetence in the case of an emerging disease scenario because none of the remaining alleles might be able to present antigens of a novel parasitic type (Altizer et al. 2001; Radwan et al. 2010) .",

We also recommend extending the structural variance approach with quantitative measurements of transcript levels of immune-relevant genes (Bowen et al. 2006; Axtner and Sommer 2009; Weyrich et al. 2010) to provide a timely and relevant measure of altered host immune potential and environmental stress.",
