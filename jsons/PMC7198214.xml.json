            "text": "In many wild and poverty areas, drinking water sterilization and wound disinfection are urgent problems. There are still around one billion people without electricity in the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the rate of access to electricity is only 44.6% [1,2]. Many plagues are also caused by water pollution or wound infection that cannot be disinfected in time. At present, common methods for disinfecting drinking water in the wild include electrochemistry [3,4], chlorine [5,6], bleach [7], boiling disinfection [8,9], etc. Most of these disinfections might cost too much time or cause secondary pollution, resulting in the poor quality of drinking water. In recent years, ultraviolet sterilization has become getting more popular as a new sterilization technology, especially it has the characteristics of fast sterilization and no secondary pollution. In addition, ultraviolet light has a large number of applications in medical treatment [10,11], chemical testing [12], etc., but its dependence on the power grid makes it almost impossible to use in areas without electricity or in the wild. Of course, the application of ultraviolet light in the industrial field should not be ignored. With the development of emerging light curing technologies such as UV-curing 3D printing, electronic packaging, dyeing [[13], [14], [15]], the application of ultraviolet rays will spread all over the industry. At present, there are mainly two ways to generate ultraviolet rays: One is a UV-LED lamp, it cannot meet the requirements on many occasions due to the short device life as a result of heat dissipation and immature technology. Another method is to use Ar\u2013Hg lamp to produce ultraviolet light, but the lighting excited condition requires a high voltage of above 800 V. A common solution is to attach a complex boost circuit with AC 220 V which makes UV technology difficult to apply in areas without electricity. Therefore, a grid-independent UV sources is very promising and urgent for the market, especially in poor areas such as Africa.",

The method of using solar power is often inefficient because of the complex and varied weather. Using wind and water to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy has become a more common and efficient method. However, most of the methods are currently used to directly charge the battery for storing electrical energy. If it is used to generate ultraviolet light, a complex boost circuit should be needed which will lead to a great attenuation of efficiency due to the power consumption of components in the boost circuit.",

In particular, more and more attention has been paid to the high voltage application of TENG, because the natural high voltage characteristics of TENG have shown great advantages in many fields, such as generating microplasma [47,48], field emission of electrons [49], quantitatively generating the input ions in mass spectrometry [50], Electrohydrodynamic Jet Printing [51], electro-assisted cell printing [52] and so on. Therefore, it is an ingenious and effective method to directly generate ultraviolet by TENG utilizing its high voltage characteristics. Previously, Chi Zhang et al. realized that generating ultraviolet radiation by the effect of triboelectric between PTFE and the glass chamber wall. Its mechanism is utilizing Ar discharge to stimulate mercury atom, which could produce the ultraviolet [53]. However, it can only produce in-situ ultraviolet radiation according to its structure and principle, which will greatly limit the application of ultraviolet radiation in space, especially in those areas where the position and angle of light need to be changed. (The systematical comparison of Water sterilization technology by TENG is presented in Supplementary note 1).",

It could guide optimization in the future. In addition, Argon glow discharge performance in Mobile-UV tube directly affects ultraviolet generation, in order to further analyze the characteristic of glow discharge, the electron temperature and density of glow discharge were explored through the comparison of simulation and experiment. Finally, the versatility and practicability of the system were verified by the preliminary application of the Mobile-UV in the fields of bio-sterilization, chemical detection, and UV-curing. We believe that the Moblie-UV system will show tremendous innovations in the generation approaches and application scenarios of ultraviolet radiation, especially for the application of ultraviolet radiation in a large number of areas of no or poor electricity.",

According to this condition, the freestanding rotary (FR) TENG structure is selected to power for the whole system. As the core component of the Mobile-UV system, the UV reactor has been designed and improved for different applications. The concept of the whole Mobile-UV system and its preliminary verification in related fields are shown in Fig. 1\n(a). As a special form of freestanding triboelectric-layer mode, the operating mechanism of FR-TENG shows in Fig. 1 (b), the rotor of FR-TENG is acrylic covered with PVC film. In order to reduce the wear rate of FR-TENG and optimize the contact area between rotor and stator, the PVC film is designed as a floating structure; the stator is covered with nylon film based on copper plating on Printed Circuit Board (PCB). It is noteworthy that the output electrodes of FR-TENG are directly connected with the two electrodes of the UV tube. Compared with the traditional mode of driving the ultraviolet Ar\u2013Hg lamp, the Mobile-UV has a simple structure and can be lighted without additional complex boost circuits. Fig. 1 (c) shows the detailed photograph and luminescence patterned of Mobile-UV tube directly driven by FR-TENG. The Non-luminescence patterned is shown in Supplementary note 2.

            "text": "In order to further analyze the characteristics of Mobile-UV and optimize the emission efficiency of ultraviolet radiation. Firstly, the electric characteristics of FR-TENG are tested in detail. As shown in Fig. 2\n(a) (b). The output performance of open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (ISC) of 12 units FR-TENG at different rotational speeds is tested, From Fig. 2 (c), it can be seen that the Voc is a little different. The 6 units one has the highest output voltage (about 4000 V at 400 RPM) instead of the 4 units one among these three structures. The discrepancy comes from the floating design of the rotator. Due to the toughness of the material, arched edge curling will occur with the increase of the rotator area, which leads to the reduction of the actual effective contact area. Fig. 2 (d) shows the more parts the FR-TENG has, the higher the short-circuit current is, due to the faster transferring of electrons. The highest Isc of FR-TENG with 12 units at 400 RPM is 233 \u03bcA. In addition, it can also be seen that the open-circuit voltage of 4,6,12 units ones are higher than 2000 V, which is far exceeding the discharge condition of the UV tube. As the current plays a more crucial role than the voltage in UV discharge, the 12 units structure with the highest current and a high enough voltage is adopted. The specific structure of FR-TENG is shown in Fig. 2 (e). As shown in Fig. 2 (f), an electrometer (Keithley 6514) for load current is connected in series in the circuit and another electrometer with high-voltage probe (HPV) is connected in parallel to measure the load voltage. The load electric experiment was carried out for a UV tube (with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 50 mm). It can be seen from Fig. 2 (g) that under the drive of 12 units of FR-TENG, the effective value of load current increases with the increase of rotational speed. The maximum value appears at 400 RPM, reaching 110 \u03bcA. On the contrary, the effective value of load voltage decreases obviously with the increase of rotational speed. It is because the generation of UV light is a discharge process which will lead to a sudden drop in voltage. With the increase of rotational speed, the discharge frequency in the UV tube increases, resulting in a significant reduction in the effective value of voltage. The waveforms of the load voltage and load current are shown in Supplementary note 3 in detail. Finally, the influence of load power with rotational speed was studied. Fig. 2 (h) shows that the load power of Mobile-UV will increase with the increase of rotational speed.",

            "text": "Subsequently, the optical characteristic of Mobile-UV was quantitatively studied. Fig. 3\n(a) shows the absolute spectral intensity of the Mobile-UV tube (with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 50 mm) driven by FR-TENG at rotational speed from 100 to 400 RPM. It can be seen that with the increase of rotational speed, the absolute intensity of Mobile-UV increases linearly at 253 nm, reaching a maximum of 250.5 \u03bcW/cm2/nm. UV sterilization band is usually in the range of 240\u2013280 nm, the overwhelming majority of published papers on the effects of UV on bacteria were conducted at one wavelength, 254 nm. Because this wavelength is near the peak of DNA absorption for bacteria [54]. So the ultraviolet light with the main wavelength of 253 nm is exactly what we use for sterilization. Then, the effects on the absolute strength of the UV tube in length and diameter were investigated. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 (b) (c). It can be seen that the absolute light intensity emitted by the UV tube has a significant attenuation with the increasing diameter (from 4 to 6 mm), and the lowest value is 50 \u03bcW/cm2/nm. The absolute intensity of the UV tube is also weaker with increasing length (from 40 to 70 mm), with a minimum of 75 \u03bcW/cm2/nm. It is worth noting that the change in diameter and length of the UV tube does not affect the apparent peak intensity at 253 nm. The fixed TENG structure and speed make the power input to UV tubes of different sizes almost the same. As the diameter and length of the UV tube increase, the volume inside the lamp tube will increase accordingly, which will reduce the light energy per unit volume. The optical fiber probe is concentrated at a point in the middle of the tube when measuring, so the measurement value will decrease as the diameter and length of the UV tube increase. Except for a few 700\u2013900 nm infrared bands generated by Ar discharge, most of the converted light energy is concentrated near the UVC band of 253 nm. It indirectly illustrates the high efficiency of UV light produced by Mobile-UV, which will provide data support for applications of Mobile-UV in the future.",

Among them, PUV is the light power of the ultraviolet tube, PE is the output electric power of the FR-TENG, I0 is the absolute intensity of the ultraviolet light emitted by the UV tube. Because the size of the UV tube is short, I0  is regarded as a constant under the model of assuming the tube as a line source. r , L is the diameter, length of the UV tube, respectively. U,I is the load voltage, current of the UV tube. It is not difficult to see from Fig. 3 (e) that as the speed increases, the efficiency will change significantly.

            "text": "In essence, Ultraviolet is the photon radiation produced by electron transition during plasma discharge. Therefore, the performance of plasma glow discharge will directly affect the intensity of Mobile-UV. In order to further study the properties of plasma glow discharge of Mobile-UV, the method of using COMSOL to simulate the entire discharge process is introduced. As shown in Fig. 4\n(a), the left side of the symmetrical structure is the real photo of the glow discharge time of the device, and the right side is the electron density distribution map at the discharge moment obtained by COMSOL plasma simulation. It shows that the simulation using COMSOL has good agreement and effectiveness. From the distribution map, it can be seen that the electron density is close to 2 \u00d7 1015/m3 at the time of discharge. With the help of the plasma module in COMSOL Multiphysics, the simulation parameters are set according to the actual experimental conditions, and the simulation of the discharge process in a cycle (f = 6 Hz, T = 0.016 s) is realized. The specific setup in the COMSOL model is shown in Supplementary note 4. The result of the simulated current agrees well with the actual measured current, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). In addition, we get the time-domain distribution of the main plasma parameters (Potential of Plasma, Density of Electrons, and Temperature of Electrons, etc.) in the quartz glass tube. The actual voltage of the electrode can be seen that there is a positive and negative alternating situation between 0 and 0.166 s, and a sudden voltage drop occurs at 0.016 s, as shown in Fig. 4 (c). It can be seen from Fig. 4 (d) that a pulse value appears in the number of electrons, which proves that a glow discharge phenomenon occurred at this moment. Fig. 4 (e) shows the change of the electron temperature at the time of discharge. The electron temperature will change with the alternating voltage load on the electrodes whose highest value can reach 15 eV. The Density and Temperature of Electrons along the axis inside of the tube from positive to the negative electrode are shown in Supplementary note 5. The Density of Electrons changes in a full cycle is shown in Supplementary Movie 2.",

            "text": "Mobile-UV can be used in most applications where traditional UV could be used for. For example, bio-sterilization is widely recognized for its stability, safety, low consumption, and high efficiency in water treatment. The application of Mobile-UV in water sterilization has been deeply explored. The whole Mobile-UV sterilization system is shown in Fig. 5\n(a). The system mainly includes three modules: FR-TENG as the power supply module, UV sterilizer as the ultraviolet sterilization module and peristaltic pump as the liquid delivery module 1\u00d7108 CFU/ml E. coli solution flowed through the Mobile-UV sterilization tube at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by a peristaltic pump. At the same time, the output electrodes of FR-TENG are directly connected with the two electrodes of the Mobile-UV without additional complicated circuits. When FR-TENG and peristaltic pump are started simultaneously, the UV sterilizer is in the actual working state. At this time, the water will be treated in the process of passing through the UV sterilizer and flow into the clean sterile liquid container. The specific experimental process is shown in Fig. 5 (b). According to the above analysis of the intensity of the Mobile-UV system, it was known that the system has the highest intensity at the speed of 400 RPM for FR-TENG. So this rotational speed was set as the working speed of the sterilization experiment. Two different structure sterilizers were designed for Bio-sterilization, such as Fig. 5 (c). The left figure is named Pass-flow Sterilizer (PfS) which the U-type UV reactor is covered by the sterilizing liquid and the reaction-liquid layer is parallel to the UV reactor from the luminescence photograph; The right picture is named Spiral Sterilizer (SpS) where a spiral pipeline is included in, and as is shown in the working statement of the SpS, this spiral pipe is covered by the generated ultraviolet rays, and the specific structure of the two UV reactors is presented in Supplementary note 6. The two types of UV sterilizers are characterized in that there is only a thin layer of high-transparent quartz glass between the ultraviolet light and the liquid to be treated, which minimizes the attenuation rate of ultraviolet rays and improves the sterilization effect for Mobile-UV. As shown in Fig. 5 (d), the sterilization rate of the PfS at working speed can reach 80%, and the sterilization rate of the SpS is 30%. The above sterilization rate is the case where the solution is coated plate immediately after sterilization. Considering the influence of the nutrients in the medium on the reactivation of E. coli may lead to a decrease in the sterilization rate, an experiment in which the plated count placed in the PfS solution for 1 h later was designed to eliminate the above-mentioned influencing factors, and the bactericidal rate was 89%.",

Therefore, we applied a layer of UV-curing glue to the surface of a cylindrical block (diameter is 20 mm) which was made of different materials (aluminum, copper, steel, PLA, ABS) and attached it to a transparent acrylic sheet (thickness is 5 mm), and then we irradiated it by this system.

This chemical reaction will affect the absorbance in 352 nm (A352) of the KI\u2212KIO3 solutions. Therefore, the Mobile-UV reactor was placed in a plastic tube containing the KI\u2212KIO3 mixed solution, as shown in Fig. 5 (g). This system irradiated the mixed solution for 10, 20, 30, and 40 min at 400 RPM for FR-TRNG, respectively.

The results from Fig. 5 (h) shown that the deeper the photochemical reaction is, the higher the concentration of I3\u2212 in the solution is with the accumulation of irradiation time, so the color of solutions was deepened correspondingly.

For this system, electric and spectral characteristics were analyzed, respectively. The results showed that as the speed accelerated, the discharge current of the two electrodes increased and the load voltage decreased. It was observed that the efficiency of photoelectric conversion for UV tube would be improved with the increase of rotational speed. Factor experiments about different sizes were conducted to obtain the change rule of light intensity. The simulation under COMSOL was conducted to study the underlying mechanisms of Mobile-UV in the plasma field, the experiment and simulation were in well agreement. Finally, the applications in bio-sterilization, chemical detection, and UV-curing verified the great advantage as Mobile ultraviolet light sources. Taking natural advantage, high voltage, low current and charge, this technology broadens the field of high voltage applications of TENG. We believe that it will promote the application of ultraviolet light in wild sterilization, wound treatment, chemical detection, medical diagnosis, and even 3D light-curing printing. Recently, the highly infectious coronavirus COVID-19 respiratory disease is sweeping the globe, which results in more demand for often disinfection and sterilization of public facilities, such as door handles or faucet handles, etc. The Mobile-UV might be a promising technology for converting the mechanical energy of door opening or water flowing to UV radiation in the condition mentioned above.",
