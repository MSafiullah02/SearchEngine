The large pectoral muscle mass of fowl reduces transmission of cardiac sounds. Auscultation may be improved by placing the stethoscope diaphragm on the dorsal thorax, lateral thorax, or thoracic inlet. Alternatively, an electronically amplified esophageal stethoscope may be used. Pulses may be palpable at the tibiotarsal or deep radial artery.5, 6 A weak or thready pulse can be a sign of shock, whereas an absent pulse can indicate cardiac asystole, peripheral vasoconstriction, hypovolemia, or hypotension.7 The basilic vein or cutaneous ulnar vein can be digitally pressed to examine capillary refill time (CRT). Normally, when the finger is removed from the vein, refilling cannot be witnessed visually. If it can be witnessed visually the bird is considered approximately 5% dehydrated, and if 1 second can be counted, then the bird is about 10% dehydrated or in shock.8 In chickens, the comb should be firm and red. A CRT can be assessed on the comb. It should refill within 2 seconds.8 Mucous membrane color can be assessed by everting the vent or the eyelid.",

Indirect blood pressure measurement techniques used in fowl include Doppler, photoplethysmographic/photoacoustic probes with a sphygmomanometer, and oscillometric monitors.17 Systolic blood pressure determination via ultrasonic Doppler flow detection correlates well with direct blood pressure measurements in ducks (A platyrhynchos).18 Diastolic, and therefore mean, blood pressure cannot be obtained with this method.18 Direct arterial pressure measurement is ideal but not commonly used because of the need for specific technical skill, the invasive nature of the procedure, and the cost of equipment.18 For medium to large birds (>200 g), the deep radial artery is the preferred site for arterial catheter placement, whereas for smaller birds (<200 g) the superficial ulnar artery is preferred. For waterbirds or long-legged birds, the cranial tibial or dorsal metatarsal arteries are acceptable sites for catheterization. Catheterization of the external carotid artery usually requires a cut-down for proper visualization.19 A study performed on anesthetized Galliformes comparing glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure found that Galliformes were able to maintain their glomerular filtration rate when mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranged between 60 and 110 mm Hg. When MAP decreased to less than 50 mm Hg, chickens were unable to sustain glomerular filtration and urine output ceased.19 Unlike chickens that have normal systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures of 99 \u00b1 13, 84 \u00b1 13, and 69 \u00b1 15 mm Hg, respectively, values for normotension are higher in other Galliformes (eg, turkeys).18, 19 If the definition of hypotension in humans (reduction of 30% from the baseline of conscious MAPs) is extrapolated to birds, the level of blood pressure at which birds are considered hypotensive would have a tendency to be higher than that recorded in mammals, with the exception of some Galliformes and Anseriformes species.19 Hypovolemia is treated with intraosseous or intravenous bolus administration of crystalloids (10\u201320 mL/kg) or colloids (5 mL/kg) until systolic pressures are restored.20, 21 Reference blood pressure values have been determined for different species of fowl.6, 19\n",

The apnea and bradycardia that occur when an induction mask is placed over the beak and face are consequences of a stress response caused by stimulation of trigeminal nerve receptors.40, 41, 42 Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for several minutes reduced this response in dabbling but not diving ducks.41 The isoflurane vaporizer is set to 3% to 4% for induction.6 Intubation with a noncuffed endotracheal tube is recommended for anesthetic procedures lasting more than 15 minutes. Waterfowl females may require an endotracheal tube 0.5 to 1 full size larger than males of the same species.6 If intubation is not feasible because of the nature of the procedure to be performed or anatomic structures preventing intubation (eg, presence of crista ventralis), ventilation can be achieved via air sac perfusion.43 Airway patency should be regularly checked during waterfowl anesthesia because the thickening of mucus in the trachea or glottis may completely obstruct the endotracheal tube, leading to death of the patient. Anticholinergic drugs reduce pharyngeal and tracheal secretions but also increase their viscosity, and so are only recommended for treatment of bradycardia.6\n",

In poultry, infection is often systemic, and occasionally fatal. Clinical signs, incubation periods, morbidity, and mortality vary widely depending on the virulence of the strain infecting the flock. Common clinical signs observed with chlamydiosis are sinusitis, rhinitis, diarrhea, and weakness. Postmortem findings in affected birds include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, airsacculitis, pericarditis, and peritonitis.67, 68 In turkeys, the disease pattern differs from other species and tends to present as an explosive outbreak.69 Clinical signs can be aggravated by concurrent infections, such as Salmonella or Pasteurella. Ideally, a combination of serology and PCR identification is used to diagnosis chlamydia. However, after adequate therapy, there is no currently available test to ascertain whether affected birds are no longer carriers; therefore, treatment should be carefully considered, because of its zoonotic risk, especially in collections open to the public.61 Chlortetracycline (1000 ppm; ie, 18.2 g/kg food daily for 45 days) has been recommended in turkeys, although doxycycline (25 mg/kg PO twice a day or 240 ppm in food daily for 45 days; or 50\u2013100 mg/kg IM weekly on 6 occasions) is also used in outbreaks to reduce mortality in turkeys as well as in other species.64, 70\n",

That number represents a quarter of all recorded deaths regarding migratory swans.78 Not only waterfowl are affected by this, because other terrestrial game birds and fowl may ingest lead pellets that they mistake for grit or food; lead pellets may be buried in mud, in areas where fishing or hunting has previously taken place. Animals can experience chronic intoxication when ingesting small numbers of lead pellets intermittently, but can also present acutely and in the form of an outbreak when reduced water levels or other circumstances expose lead that was previously unavailable. In the United Kingdom, the sale and use by fishermen of lead leger weights and split shot weighing less than 28 g has been banned since 1987.79 Since then, the incidence of lead poisoning has reduced significantly.80 However, the environmental contamination will still have an effect for many years.",

Other common findings in chronic cases on radiographs are dilatation and impaction of the proventriculus.79 A blood sample should always be tested for lead levels to achieve a definitive diagnosis (normal, <0.4 ppm; diagnostic, 0.5\u20132.0 ppm; severe, >2.0 ppm). Moderate anemia (20%\u201338% hematocrit) can be observed.82 Delta amino levulinic acid dehydrase activity has been suggested as a more sensitive diagnostic indicator for lead intoxication.83 Early treatment of lead toxicosis should include stopping any further lead absorption; lead particles within the gastrointestinal tract can be removed by lavage under general anesthesia with warm fluid via a gastric tube.82 Some investigators recommend repeating gastric lavage within 24 to 48 hours if lead particles are still present in postlavage radiographs, because fragments of lead can be trapped in crevices in the koilin. Those particles precipitate when muscle activity has restarted.84 Chelation therapy should be started in all affected animals. Sodium calcium edetate (10\u201340 mg/kg intramuscularly every 24 hours for 10 days, with a 5-day break at day 5) is the recommended treatment of lead and zinc toxicosis.

Despite the crop/esophagus, proventriculus, and/or gizzard being full of a solid mass of interwoven fibrous material, the intestines of birds with this condition are frequently empty.56 Poultry have been known to ingest poorly digestible items (eg, grass, newspaper, sawdust shavings/wood chips, and feathers) out of curiosity or as a response to stress, causing crop impaction. Crop impaction is most frequently seen in spring, when chickens ingest long stems of grass that get impacted in the crop. Captive waterfowl, especially geese, suddenly exposed to new environments may ingest nondigestible items like newspaper or plant products, like grasses. Ingestion of grains that have low moisture content with concurrent exposure to water can lead to grain swelling and result in impaction of the esophagus.93 Gizzard impaction can cause high mortality during the first 3 weeks of life in turkey flocks.56 Although rehydration of the impaction, gentle massage or flushing (only for crop or esophageal impactions), and liquid paraffin may help to resolve the impaction in early cases, surgical intervention might be necessary (Fig. 10\n).",

Intussusception and volvulus have been reported in chickens secondary to enteritis or abnormal peristalsis caused by nematode or coccidial infection. Intestinal torsion has also been associated with pedunculated neoplastic stalks. Clinical signs are anorexia and progressive weight loss, which may lead to death within a few days.

This condition can be caused by an underlying disorder or can occur after a stressful event while the egg was forming within the oviduct. In both situations the yolk reaches the coelomic cavity causing a coelomitis. Secondary bacterial colonization can occur. Often this occurs because of pathologic changes in the oviduct, with either infectious or neoplastic causes, or because of oviductal damage in battery hens. A recent study performed in backyard poultry in the United States revealed that the most common condition diagnosed was Marek disease.57 In that study, the most common finding observed in gross postmortem was the presence of tumors affecting internal organs or carcinomatosis, which can affect the ovaries. Equally, non\u2013viral-induced reproductive neoplasia, despite having significantly different findings in the 2 different institutions involved in the study, is also considered common. Salpingitis was one of the most common presentations in 1 of the institutions, with 7.8% of the presented cases.",

Young pullets laying an unusually large egg are most prone to the problem.56 As in other avian species, this condition is often linked to calcium imbalance, caused by a combination of dietary deficiencies, stress, and other husbandry-related problems. Treatment includes fluid therapy, calcium, and oxytocin administration. If initial medical management is unsuccessful, ovocentesis (either directly into the egg shell or via the coelomic wall) should be the next step. The egg should not be manually broken or pulled, because iatrogenic damage to the oviduct may occur. If the shell of the egg is not eliminated within 24 hours, salpingohysterectomy is indicated because the remnants of the shell might adhere to the oviduct, inevitably causing further complications in future oviposition.",
