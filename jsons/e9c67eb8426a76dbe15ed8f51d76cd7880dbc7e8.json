Absence of an antiviral agent and vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has strangled the treating health care providers. The special population that is at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV2 infection are immunocompromised, and HIV infected persons, pregnant woman, and cancer patients (2) . We hereby discuss the challenges being faced by cancer patients, specifically the transplant recipients and their respective donors during COVID-19 pandemic. Transplantation societies are working closely to provide optimal support and recommendations to the transplant specialists to guide them to conduct hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in the safest manner.",

Similarly, ensuring the well-being and mental stability of the transplant staff is equally important. Measures include maintaining an adequate backup pool, relocating susceptible staff to non-clinical tasks, regular psychological checkups, etc. could help the working team from getting overwhelmed and burnout.",

            "text": "et al paper, none of the other studies have mentioned cancer-related aspects in-depth like the type of cancer, stage of cancer, and treatment (chemoradiotherapy, surgery, etc.) received (3). The study by Liang et al (National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease group) was conducted across 575Chinese hospitals involving 1590 COVID-19 cases. It showed that patients with cancer had a concerning is the higher chance of requiring the intensive level of care, mechanical ventilation and potential deaths amongst the cancer patients, as compared to non-cancer patients (39% vs 8%, p= 0.0003) (3).COVID-19 in post-HCT patients. What is the current literature?Transplant recipients constitute a special population of cancer patients, that need morespecialized and tailored attention and care. Unfortunately, we do not have any database as of now regarding such patients during present pandemic or previous outbreaks of coronaviruses (MERS and SARS). A recent report (dated 20 th March 2020) by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) society mentioned about 15 cases of post-transplant COVID-19 confirmed cases in Europe (Spain-5, Italy-3, Sweden-2, Belgium-2, France-2, Greece-1). The median age of patients was 59 years with 12 allogeneic HCT, the remaining 3 had autologous HCT. The majority of patients (10 cases) had symptoms related to the upper respiratory tract. Till the time of the report briefing, one patient already died due to COVID-19 (6). Another report by Huang et al from China discussed the grave prognosis of two post-transplant patients (for acute myeloid leukemia and end-stage renal failure) on immunosuppressants. Both patients went J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f school and university closures to contain community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (10). By implementing measures like judicious use of blood products, cancellations of elective surgeries and public awareness, Pagano et al were able to overcome the scarcity of blood products. This is something very crucial for transplant patients because they need blood and blood components in amounts which are exceedingly higher than in routine patients. One can always ask if SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via blood transfusions? At least, to date, there is no documentation of transfusion-related coronavirus reaction in the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as during the past outbreaks of MERS and SARS.",
