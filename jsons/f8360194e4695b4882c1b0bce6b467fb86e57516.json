Activation of their fusion capacity involves large structural rearrangements of these glycoproteins upon interaction with specific triggers (e.g. low pH, cellular receptors, etc.). These conformational changes result in the exposure of hydrophobic motifs (the so-called fusion peptides or fusion loops), which then interact with one or both of the participating membranes resulting in their destabilization and their merger [1] . Triggering of the conformational change in the absence of a target membrane leads to inactivation of the fusion properties of the fusogenic glycoprotein.",

Although the structure of these glycoproteins is quite different from one class to another, the membrane fusion pathway seems to be very similar for all the enveloped viruses studied so far [3] [4] [5] . It is generally assumed that fusion proceeds via the formation of an initial stalk that is a local lipidic connection between the outer leaflets of the fusing membranes. Radial expansion of the stalk induces the formation of a transient hemifusion diaphragm (i.e. a local bilayer made by the two initial inner leaflets). The next step is the formation of a pore in the fusion diaphragm. The pore's enlargement, which is the most energetically expensive step, leads to complete fusion [6] .",

            "text": "Three different classes of viral fusion proteins have been identified to date based on their common structural elements [2] (Figure 1 ). Class I fusion proteins are characterized by their post-fusion structure, which could be described as a trimer of hairpins [7] . The best-characterized members of this class are the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) [8, 9] and the fusion protein (F) of paramyxoviruses [10, 11] , but this class also includes fusion proteins from retroviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses [7] . Both the pre-fusion and post-fusion structures of class I fusion glycoproteins are trimeric. In most of the cases, the subunits constituting the trimer result from the proteolytic cleavage of a precursor into two fragments. The resulting C-terminal fragment, which is anchored in the viral membrane by a hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domain, bears at or near its amino-terminal end a hydrophobic fusion peptide, buried at a protein-protein interface in the ectodomain of the pre-fusion state. Immediately downstream the fusion peptide, there is a first heptad repeat region (called HRA or HR1). A second one (called HRB or HR2) is located upstream the TM domain. In the post-fusion conformation, the HRA region forms a central trimeric coiled coil against which are packed, in an antiparallel manner, the HRB segments abutting the carboxy-terminal TM domains. Thus, in the post-fusion conformation, the protomer shape is an elongated hairpin-like structure with the fusion peptide and the TM domain located at the same end, as expected at the end of the fusion process. Except for this common central structural motif, the structures of class I fusion glycoproteins are very different from each other. Whether there is a common origin to all these proteins or if they represent convergent solutions to developing a membrane fusion machinery is still an open question.",

These proteins have a common origin and display a molecular architecture completely different from that of class I proteins [16] . They are synthesized and folded as a complex with a second viral envelope protein that acts as a chaperone. Proteolytic cleavage of the chaperone primes the fusion protein to trigger membrane merger at low pH. In their native conformation, they form homodimers (flaviviruses) or heterodimers (alphaviruses) that are organized in an icosahedral assembly. Their ectodomain is made of three domains made mostly of b-sheets (DI: central domain (CD); DII: fusion domain (FD); DIII: lateral, C-terminal domain) and lie flat or nearly flat at the viral surface. The fusion loop, located internally between two b-strands of domain II, is buried at a dimer interface. Considered in a single protomer, the conformational change is much less impressive than that observed for HA or for paramyxovirus F protein, since there is essentially no change in the secondary structure. Ribbon illustrations of representative members of the three classes of viral fusion glycoproteins. Domains for the paramyxovirus (class I) and flavivirus (class II) proteins are colored and named according to [10, 11] and [12] , respectively. Domains for the rhabdovirus (class III) protein are colored and named according to [21] with the exception that the central domain (CD) that was initially ascribed to two domains (DI and DII) is now considered as a single domain and corresponds to the previously described rigid block that remains invariant during the transition [21] . The dash lines represent the segments at the C-termini of the ectodomains that connect them to the TM domain (not represented). Respective pdb codes of each protein are showed in parentheses.",

In particular, domain III, which is connected to the C-terminal part of the molecule, moves by about 35 \u00c5 (and also rotates by 658 for the flavivirus E), moving toward the fusion loop in the postfusion trimer. The movement of domain III redirects the polypeptide chain, so that in the post-fusion trimeric form the TM segment is located near the fusion loop region. Therefore, here again, each protomer constituting the trimer has a hairpin structure.",

The CD also comprises a bsheet rich region connecting to the C-terminal segment of the ectodomain. This segment itself connects to the TM domain in the intact glycoprotein. It is shorter in the VSV G post-fusion ectodomain crystal structure than in the ectodomains of gB [18] and gp64 [20] , where the extra region forms an a helical structure that inserts between the other two protomers within the trimer. The organization of the class III FD is very similar to that of class II fusion proteins, although the class II and class III proteins are not homologous and the FDs' topologies are inconsistent. Detailed points of convergence include an extended b-sheet structure terminating in a threestranded sheet at the tip of which is located the membrane-interacting motif of the ectodomain. In VSV G both of the two loops at the tip of FD are fusion loops. In the pre-fusion structure, in contrast to class I and class II fusion proteins, the fusion loops are not buried at an oligomeric interface but point toward the viral membrane.",

During this low pH-induced structural transition, both relocation of domains and major secondary structure modifications occur. The three domains retain their tertiary structure but undergo large rearrangements in their relative orientation. This is driven by refolding of large hinge regions between domains, the change in the two segments connecting CD to PHD being particularly dramatic and leading to lengthening of the CD central helix. Similarly, the C-terminal segment of the ectodomain both completely relocates and refolds from a series of short b-strands, helices and loops buried in part in the trimeric interface to a single a-helix on the surface of the trimeric core. This conformational change exhibits striking overall similarities to that of class I proteins such as paramyxovirus fusion protein F and influenza HA [22] . As for these proteins, the pre-fusion and post-fusion states of the G protomer are related by flipping both the FD and the Cterminal segment relative to CD. During this change, both the fusion loops and the TM domain move from one end of the molecule to the other. In the trimeric postfusion state, a central core is made by the three CD central helices, in the grooves of which the three Cterminal helices position themselves in an antiparallel manner to form a six-helix bundle. The resulting overall organization of the post-fusion state is reminiscent of that of class I fusion glycoproteins.",

For tick-borne encephalitis virus, it has been suggested that the initial interaction with the target membrane involves the insertion of multiple copies of E monomers and that trimerization requires coupling to domain III folding-back [33] . However, it has been demonstrated that exogenous domain III can function as a dominant-negative inhibitor of alphavirus and flavivirus membrane fusion [34] , which is consistent with the existence of a relatively long-lived core trimer intermediate with which domain III interacts. Since, for Semliki forest virus, DI/II trimers are stable in the absence of DIII, it has been proposed that DI/II trimer formation is relatively rapid, while the folding-back of domain III is a late and relatively slow step in the structural transition pathway [35, 36] .",

Taken together, these data suggested that the conformational change proceeds through monomeric states of G [37 ] (Figure 3 ). Consistent with this view are the large differences between the trimeric interfaces of the pre-fusion and post-fusion structure [21] as well as the fact that the VSV G trimers are unstable after detergent solubilization [38] .",

First, several monomers could simultaneously bind to the target membrane through their fusion loops to account for the cooperativity required at the early stage of the fusion process (i.e. stalk and initial pore formation). Second, for VSV, post-fusion trimers located outside the contact zone between virion and cellular membranes can reorganize into regular arrays, the formation of which has been suggested to induce pore enlargement [39 ] . This latter hypothesis is consistent with the model of Kozlov and Chernomordik [40] , according to which fusion proteins outside the contact zone generate the driving force for pore enlargement by forming a coat around the fusion site. It is also in agreement with experimental data from the same group obtained on influenza, showing that HAs located outside the fusion site are involved in late stages of the fusion reaction [41] .",

(a) In the case of paramyxovirus F glycoprotein, a trimeric pre-hairpin intermediate has been suggested to interact with the target membrane. This intermediate could be trapped by using a peptide derived from HRB (cyan cylinder), which inhibits fusion. It is believed that the interaction between the inhibitor and HRA (dark blue domain) mimics the six-helix bundle observed in the post-fusion state. (b) For class II fusion glycoproteins (here represented by E from Dengue virus), upon lowering the pH, the dimeric prefusion forms dissociates. Monomers interact with the target membrane and have been suggested to form trimeric pre-hairpin intermediates. In these intermediates, DIII have not folded back yet toward DI as in the E post-fusion form. The interaction of exogenous DIII with the trimeric intermediates prevents DIII foldback and blocks fusion. ",

The only crystal structure of an intermediate has been obtained on an HA mutant with a mutation in HA2 FD that stabilizes the HA trimer in a prefusion-like state at and below fusogenic pH [43] . Only very subtle differences could be detected between this structure and HA prefusion structure indicating that, in the crystal, HA was trapped in a very early intermediate conformation.
