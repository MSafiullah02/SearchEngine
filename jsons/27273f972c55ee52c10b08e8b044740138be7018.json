Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country. In this article, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the spread of COVID-19 in India, patient statistics, as well as proposed a mathematical prediction system that has succeeded in predicting the following day's number of cases with 83% accuracy, ever since the first COVID-19 case was declared in India.",

Needless to say, this is a drastic difference from the current state of affairs, as we prepare to enter May 2020 with 35, 403 cases, almost thrice the value predicted for the end of May. A different model [11] predicted that 54 days of total lockdown would yield around 5, 000 cases. On 95 the 40 th day of lockdown, with seven times as many cases, we can see that this model is not offering good predictions either. Yet another mathematical model [12] estimates that with lockdown from 25 th March onwards (as happened), we would have just shy of 10, 000 cases by end-April, which, once again, is one-third the total number of cases right now, and the number of cases by the end of April 100 25, 2020 was about 2.7 times as predicted.",

We further note, that there is a tradeoff in selecting the values of \u03b1 to be too high or too low -a value much further from 1 will spread out the range and thus have a greater chance of being 'correct', but at the same time a huge range prevents a model from being very precise, although accurate. Hence, we have kept the tradeoff 165 balance by predicting a range whose midpoint, on average, deviates only by 61 cases from the actual or true value. This is a mere 3.21% of the maximum daily cases reported in this period, and just 3.39% of the latest day (April 30, 2020)'s reported cases (Figure 2) . Moreover, there has been only one mis-predicted day in the last 30 days (i.e., over the month of April), with the model thus having 170 96.67% accuracy over the last month. We note, most of the prediction errors are around days 30 to 42. The model is self-correcting as it improves its predictions every day, by incorporating the previous day's data into the trendline for the following days. This model can thus be used dynamically not only to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India, but also to check the effect of various government 175 measures in a short span of time after they are implemented.",

In the rest of this article, we propose a model and prediction system that is developed 75 very specifically with India in mind, and currently offers excellent predictions.Background Research. There are multiple models attempting to predict the spread of coronavirus in the world currently. These notably include the UPenn CHIME model [6], a discrete-time SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) modeling of infections/recovery, which as shown in the following paragraph, fails on 80 predicting the spread of COVID-19 in India. Another SIR based model being used widely includes Health Catalyst [7]. Non-SIR models performing statistical/mathematical modeling are also evolving, such as a Gauss error function and Monte Carlo simulation [8] for Italy and other statistical models [9] in the USA -nonetheless, none of them satisfactorily predicting the spread yet, especially 85 when applied to India. Background Research for India. There have been limited research in modeling and predicting the spread of COVID-19 in India so far, owing both to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and limited availability of data.
