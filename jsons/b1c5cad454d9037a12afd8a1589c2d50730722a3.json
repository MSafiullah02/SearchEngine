Genetically engineered viruses can readily synthesize biologically active heterologous proteins, serve to determine relevant targets of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and identify types of immune responses needed for protection against a multitude of different specific diseases. Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing.

Compared to currently marketed vaccines, viral vectors appear still as futuristic option in vaccine development. Yet, many of today's health problems where vaccines are believed to become key medicines are likely not to be solved with existing technologies. Adequate biological and clinical safety, large packaging capacity for recombinant DNA, precise virus-specific control of target gene expression, high-level immunogenicity, lack of persistence or genomic integration in the host, and ease of vector and vaccine production are important features supporting the use of recombinant poxviruses as advanced tools for immunization. While making a multivalent poxvirus vector vaccine has been proposed as a particularly desirable medicinal product [2], recombinant poxviruses are primarily investigated as novel vaccines against major human and animal diseases that still lack effective intervention strategies. A major achievement has been the application of vector viruses providing extraordinary levels of safety with regard to protection of the non-target environment and use in possibly immunocompromised target populations [3, 4] (for review see [5, 6] ). The substantial recent progress in conducting clinical research with candidate vaccines against AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria or tumor diseases may serve as an example. Poxviruses engineered as vector vaccines include viruses from multiple genera with the Orthopoxvirus Vaccinia virus (VACV) [7, 8] and Avipoxviruses [9, 10] being the first and most frequently developed for applications in human and veterinary medicine. Other promising candidate vaccines against animal diseases are derived from Parapox- [11, 12] , Suipox-[13], Capripox- [14] , or Leporipoxviruses [15, 16] .

The virus encodes its own transcription and replication machinery and its DNA is not infectious. The currently most frequently practiced strategy to generate recombinant poxviruses employs homologous DNA recombination in infected cells, a relatively frequent event during poxviral replication (0.1%). Recombination is typically directed by a plasmid-based transfer vector, containing the following features: an expression cassette, including a poxvirus-specific promoter, usually followed by a multiple cloning site to allow the insertion of the foreign gene of choice. In addition, selection or screening procedures are quite useful to ease the clonal isolation of recombinant viruses by plaque purification, which requires the additional insertion of selection marker gene expression cassettes. These heterologous DNA sequences are flanked by poxvirus DNA sequences that direct the recombination to a desired locus in a non-essential region of the poxviral genome (Fig. 1) The standard insertion locus for generating recombinant VACV is the thymidine kinase (TK) locus, which allows the selection of recombinant virus by its TK-negative phenotype due to the insertional inactivation of TK in TK-deficient cells [18] . Recently, an improved dominant negative selection procedure has been developed. A recombinant VACV with an inserted E. coli TK/thymidylate kinase (tk/tmk) fusion gene, which converts 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) into a toxic compound, has been used to construct recombinants. Inactivation of the tk/tmk gene by insertion of the transfer vector conveniently allows selection by AZT without the requirements of using TK-deficient cells [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1343, "end": 1347, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1797, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1096, "end": 1104, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Generation of recombinant poxviruses"}, {"text": "Alternatively, the transfer vector contains an antibiotic selection marker or a reporter gene allowing the screening due to a change in phenotype such as co-expression of the E. coli -galactosidase [22] and -glucuronidase [23] .

Complementation of a defect in virus production is a faster and more convenient method to obtain recombinant viruses. A first growth selection protocol was initiated using the VACV host range gene K1L to rescue mutant VACV replication in rabbit kidney RK-13 cells [25] . Blasco and colleagues [26, 27] introduced selection for plaque formation through co-insertion of the F13L gene. A VACV mutant and an appropriate complementing cell line enabled growth selection based on the essential D4R gene function [28] . Transient introduction of the K1L gene into the genome of severely growth-restricted modified VACV Ankara (MVA) is used for simple and efficient selection of recombinant MVA, because co-expression of K1L can also complement the defective MVA life cycle in RK-13 cells [29] [30] [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 789, "end": 793, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 818, "end": 822, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 823, "end": 826, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1035, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1315, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Generation of recombinant poxviruses"}, {"text": "The large size and the covalently closed hairpin ends of the dsDNA poxvirus genome have been major hurdles for direct in vitro cloning of recombinant viruses. In addition, since poxviral DNA is not infectious, isolated poxvirus genomes require a helper poxvirus supplying essential enzymes that are needed to initiate transcription and replication of the recombinant virus. This helper virus should not recombine with the vector virus and not produce infectious progeny in the cells used for the generation of recombinant virus. Avian poxviruses or leporipoxviruses fulfill this requirement for reactivation of recombinant VACV [32, 33] . In one such approach, a unique restriction site was introduced into the VACV genome and the genome was cloned in two halves in lambda phages. Religation of the two halves together with the recombinant gene between them and direct transfection into helper virus-infected cells allowed the generation of recombinant poxviruses without cloning an intermediate DNA construct in E. coli [32, 34, 35] .

Moreover, the fragile immune system of HIV-infected individuals sets high standards for candidate vaccine safety.

Many results suggest satisfying safety and efficacy of poxvirus vector vaccines with regard to eliciting specific immune responses to selected target antigens in humans. Nevertheless, the complexity involved in inducing protective immunity against infections with immunodeficiency viruses or in eliciting potent immune responses against tumour-associated self-antigens suggests that the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines may still need a booster to achieve protective vaccination against AIDS, malaria or cancer. Hereby, exciting recent results from basic poxvirus research help to reveal an astonishing versatility of poxviral strategies to counteract the innate host immune response and will lead to the generation of optimized vectors and even better poxvirus vaccines [106] [107] [108] .
