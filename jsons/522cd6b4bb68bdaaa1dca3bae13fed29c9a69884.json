Today asthma is regarded as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways instead of solely a reversible airway obstruction. The use of rescue and anti-inflammatory medication has altered the prospects of asthma patients and has improved their quality of life. Thus, most asthma patients can lead a normal life without restrictions. The degree of asthma control achieved by patients is an important predictor of the likelihood of complications of the disease [2\u2022] .",

For adults data on this issue are scarcer, but adults are believed to have as many asthma exacerbations linked with viral infections as children [7, 8] . The spectrum of viruses found consists of rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and an assortment of other viruses. Of these, RSV and influenza affect primarily the lower respiratory tract, whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus replicate in the upper respiratory tract. The mechanism by which these viruses cause asthma exacerbations is not yet known precisely. Postulations vary from direct infection to indirect induction of inflammatory responses [9] .",

In all of these studies, the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination is based on several premises. Often the incidence of influenza is approximated by that of ILI in epidemic seasons. These figures certainly exceed the average incidence of influenza when taking into account the seasons with low or no influenza activity. Other biases may be the target populations and the definition used for influenza [46] . In the elderly cost-effectiveness is globally accepted [47] . In either case, population-wide cost-effectiveness preventive options against influenza for healthy adults 14 to 60 years old do not seem to be easily achieved, and therefore some authors have suggested that the most cost-effective option is not to take any action [48] . For high-risk patients with chronic respiratory conditions, again, in the elderly cost-effectiveness was achieved; however, this was not the case for the 18 to 65 years age category [49, 50] . In children with high-risk conditions the use of influenza vaccination was calculated to be cost-effective.

An oral corticosteroid can be provided and kept on hand by the patient. This permits initiation of more prompt and effective treatment than is likely to occur when a patient must first go to a physician's office or emergency department, because it can be taken as soon as the response to bronchodilator therapy is incomplete [21] . Moreover, patients with asthma should be treated according to national and international standards. Access to and compliance with inhaled corticosteroid treatment is an important predictor of the likelihood of asthma exacerbations occurring, including those that occur during respiratory viral infections [2\u2022].",
