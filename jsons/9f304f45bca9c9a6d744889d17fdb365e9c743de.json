These patients tested positive on RT-PCR of naso-pharyngeal swabs and developed no fever, malaise, or respiratory symptoms throughout the course of their illness. They all fully recovered. In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained. Ocular involvement and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should never be overlooked. In fact, conjunctival mucosae are susceptible to respiratory viruses and remain an important point of entry. For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that emerged in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world causing an ongoing pandemic. As of 8 April 2020, approximately 1.44 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 209 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 83,400 deaths. About 308,000 people have recovered [1, 2] . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronavirus family of viruses, the same family of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses and causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Transmission occurs during close contacts when small droplets reach mucosal surfaces, namely the mouth, nose or eyes. Small droplets are released in the environment every time someone sneezes, coughs, or talks. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Clinical course varies from complete asymptomatic presentation to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [3, 4] .",

Given their travel history, the current epidemiological emergency, and the fact that conjunctivitis has been described as a presenting sign of infection with Coronaviridae family of viruses, it was decided to perform a naso-pharyngeal swab in all these five subjects.

Despite exceptional measures such as nation-wide lockdowns, containing the spread of SARS-CoV-19 has been difficult. It has been questioned whether and to which extent asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of the virus. The percentage of asymptomatic cases is also still debated, but according to a recent Japanese analysis, about 30 % (95 % confidence interval between 7.7 % and 53.8 %) of infected subjects might remain completely asymptomatic [11] . Patient zero of the Italian outbreak is believed to become infected via an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individual [12] .",
