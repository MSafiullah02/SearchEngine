Outbreaks of the disease have become more intense in Africa in terms of frequency, magnitude, duration and impact [1]. As of 18 February 2020, the most current and tenth outbreak of the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had recorded 3432 cases and 2253 deaths making it the second-largest in the history of the disease [2]. The prolonged transmission of this outbreak is associated with challenges similar to those experienced in the West African outbreak (2013\u20132016): widespread community distrust and resistance due to strong traditional beliefs, preferences and lack of community engagement, chronic underdevelopment and weak health systems. These challenges are further complicated by insecurity due to ongoing armed conflict and recurrent attacks on response assets all of which continue to impede timely control of the outbreak [3\u20135].",

The highly effective EVD alert system and preparedness measures instituted in one of the high-risk countries, Uganda ensured that it was able to timely detect and contain two cross border transmissions of the disease which were reported on 11 June and 29 August 2019 [8, 9]. This is similar to experiences from Nigeria in 2014 where an imported case was quickly identified and the resulting outbreak promptly contained [10]. Following the West Africa outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed an EVD preparedness checklist for use by its member states [11]. This checklist is being applied on a large and systematic scale for EVD preparedness for the first time in the four high-risk countries thus the need to review and document the lessons learnt from this experience. This is more pertinent given the complex humanitarian context and weak health system under which some of the countries such as RSS are implementing their EVD preparedness interventions.",

The renewed armed conflict in the country disrupted an already fragile healthcare system culminating in a severe shortage of healthcare workers, a disrupted supply management system for essential medicines and medical supplies, inadequate health financing, weak health governance and oversight system.

Basic use of improved sanitation facilities and improved drinking water sources are estimated at 10 and 50% respectively while routine immunization coverage is 44% and consequently, outbreaks such as cholera and measles have been a major component of the ongoing humanitarian response in RSS [17\u201319].",

Aside from EVD, this machine is also used to test for other viral diseases such as influenza, Yellow fever, Marburg, Rift Valley fever, and other emerging pathogens. This capacity was rapidly adapted to test for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in early 2020. Likewise, the construction of semi-permanent points of entry screening points and installation of thermal scanners at Juba International Airport and Nimule land crossing border point within the EVD preparedness framework is contributing to screening for other diseases such as the newly detected COVID-19 and longer-term strengthening of the National Port Health System. Furthermore, the semi-permanent all-purpose infectious disease management unit which was originally constructed for EVD preparedness has been adapted and is being used for isolation of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.",

The dual risk of an EVD outbreak (imported or emerging internally) alongside other epidemic-prone diseases such as cholera, measles, Yellow fever and COVID-2019 remain a plausible reality for RSS for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the southern part of RSS which has the highest risk of cross border transmission of EVD from the current DRC outbreak has experienced several years of conflict, insecurity, and inadequate access to social services including health as a result of weak health systems and lack of access. These conditions mirror those of the epicentre of the current outbreak in Ituri and North Kivu provinces of the DRC hence the need to draw lessons which would prevent the occurrence of similar challenges should an outbreak occur in RSS.",

Cross border exchange of preparedness and disease outbreak information, coordination and synchronization of preparedness and response interventions is also imperative. Second, strategic investment in intensive community engagement and participation is critical to gain the community trust long before an outbreak to prevent the type of community resistance which has played out in the DRC. As evidenced in the current outbreak in the DRC, the majority of EVD related deaths occur in the community (not in EVD treatment units) which indicates lack of community trust in government-run services in a complex political context. Similar perceptions are likely to exist in some areas in RSS. This further justifies the need for health system strengthening approach and a focus on building local capacity as a long-term preparedness strategy in epidemic-prone humanitarian settings. Additionally, a broader understanding of the historical, political, cultural and social contexts unique to each community is required to inform development and implementation of context-specific EVD preparedness programmes.",

For instance, preparedness interventions such as EVD risk communication and surveillance are required throughout the country during all phases of preparedness and response while interventions such as case management may be limited in geographic scope to specific locations where the risks of EVD importation are highest. The lessons learnt from neighbouring Uganda on their recent response experience to the importation of cases from the DRC to Kasese district conveyed an innovative approach used to overcome the challenge with predicting the location of a subsequent EVD confirmed case along their western border. A low-cost alternative (less than USD 30 000 per unit) similar to the CUBE (Chambre d\u2019Urgence Bios\u00e9curis\u00e9e, also called the Biosecure Emergency Room) which was developed by The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) [25] came in the form of rapidly deployable Ebola Isolation Units comprising of robust structures that could be stored centrally, distributed and assembled within one day.
