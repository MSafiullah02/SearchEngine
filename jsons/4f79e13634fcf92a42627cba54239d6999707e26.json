They engineered each structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone and in combination, into a bovinehuman parainfluenza virus type 3 (BHPIV3) vaccine vector, immunized golden Syrian hamsters, and challenged them with SARS-CoV.

The vaccine was derived from a clinical strain of SARS-CoV, propagated in Vero cells, inactivated with beta propiolactone and subsequently purified. The antigen content of the vaccine was reported in SARS-CoV units (SU), measured in a passive indirect hemagglutination assay rather than by quantitation of protein. The inactivated vaccine was adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide and the control group received saline injections with aluminum hydroxide. The safety of the vaccine had been evaluated in animals, and the dose range and need for adjuvant was determined from preclinical evaluation in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. The study subjects were divided into three groups of 12 (6 males and 6 females) that received 16 SU or 32 SU of vaccine or placebo, given as two doses 28 days apart administered by intramuscular injection. The vaccine ll was well tolerated, with only mild local reactogenicity and transient transaminase elevation in 3 vaccinees and 1 placebo recipient. The immunogenicity endpoint of seroconversion in 85% of the vaccines on day 56 was achieved in both of the vaccine groups; 100% of the 16 SU group, 91.1% of the 32 SU group, and none of the placebo group seroconverted on day 56. The neutralizing antibody titers were reported in units with respect to a reference serum. The frequency of seroconversion and antibody titers improved with the second dose of vaccine; titers peaked 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine and decreased 4 weeks later. Titers achieved in the vaccinees were about half of those observed in convalescent patients. The authors concluded that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic and warranted further evaluation to optimize the dose and schedule and to assess its efficacy (Lin et al., 2007) .",

Early reports suggest that human ACE-2 expressing mice, hamsters (Chan et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) , ferrets (Kim et al., 2020) , and non-human primates (Rockx et al., 2020) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but clinical signs of disease are absent or mild. It is clear that hamsters develop more significant lower respiratory tract involvement with pneumonitis than ferrets (Chan et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) .

The average number of revolutions/h that the hamsters ran on the wheel was recorded. Baseline activity level for hamsters was between 700 and 1,000 revolutions/h and decreased by 10-fold or more, to 61 \u00b1 23 revolutions/h following infection with SARS-CoV, returning to normal at 9 to 10 days postinfection (Roberts et al., 2008) . This activity measure was applied in assessing the efficacy of a live-attenuated SARS vaccine. Serial passage of the virus in animals can lead to a disease model, as we did with SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2007) and others have previously done for influenza and Ebolavirus. Older mice infected with SARS-CoV displayed clinical disease while young adult mice did not (Roberts et al., 2005; Subbarao et al., 2004) . Similar avenues for animal model development are being explored for SARS-CoV-2. In the absence of a disease model, the ability of a candidate vaccine to elicit a neutralizing antibody response against infectious virus associated with restricted replication of challenge virus in the respiratory tract should be demonstrated. Concerns about the safety of coronavirus vaccines were raised with SARS and are now being discussed with SARS-CoV-2. Efforts are underway to design studies in animal models and to develop clinical case definitions to identify vaccine-associated adverse events if they occur.",

First, the neutralizing antibody response in recovered patients should be characterized, including the average titers after asymptomatic, mild, and severe disease as well as titers in different age groups, kinetics, and longevity of neutralizing antibody. The presence of cross-reactive antibodies against human coronaviruses may differ in different age groups. This information will help us place vaccine studies in context and in comparison to the inactivated SARS vaccine from China, which was immunogenic but achieved post-vaccination titers that were half those seen in convalescent patients (Lin et al., 2007) . Second, we can undertake studies in animal models to define a protective neutralizing antibody titer. Human sera from recovered patients with a range of neutralizing antibody titers can be preadministered to a SARS-CoV-2 animal model, followed by challenge infection. The ability of human serum of a specific titer to prevent productive infection in the animal can identify a target titer for vaccines.",

However, technological advances have made rapid vaccine development possible. We have to ask ourselves what new vaccines should aim to achieve-prevent all infection or prevent severe disease and death? In which age group(s)? What effect will vaccines that address these choices have on subsequent epidemics?",
