For this purpose, several authors have recently carried out their researches on COVID-19, which were mostly based on clinical and epidemiological views and included the potential symptoms, the ways of COVID-19 transmission, and epidemic issues (2). Among them, Hellewell et al. proposed a stochastic transmission model that resulted in the case and contact isolations to control the COVID-19 outbreak (3). Moreover, Peeri et al. compared the epidemics of three types of coronaviruses, namely SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. They concluded that there were no frequent outbreaks found from two previous ones, and the challenges for the COVID-19 should be covered by the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), which will be beneficial for control the incidence among people (4). Two systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies were available in the literature. They proposed five useful factors (i.e., clinical, laboratory, imaging features, procalcitonin measurements, outcomes of confirmed cases) in predicting the severity of the COVID-19 disease (5, 6, 7).",
