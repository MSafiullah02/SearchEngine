            "text": "The rumor is unconfirmed information of public opinion, which greatly affects people\u2019s work and life. With the rapid development of Internet information technology, rumor propagation is no longer limited to word of mouth, but relies on the new media of the Internet, such as BBS, SMS, Microblog, QQ, WeChat, Twitter and other social network platforms. For the past few years, a number of emergencies caused by rumors have erupted in China, which have brought huge economic losses to the country and seriously disturbed people\u2019s life order. For example, in 2003, the rumor that banlangen could cure SARS caused residents in many cities around the country to frantically buy up banlangen, which caused a great social panic. In the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan, the rumor that iodized salt could protect against radiation caused the run on salt. These rumors seriously destroyed the social order and caused social panic. With the advent of information dissemination, there are more and more emergencies caused by rumors. Therefore, it is very significant to study and master the law of rumor propagation in the new era, which can help the government department to prevent and control rumors.",

            "text": "Since the form of rumor transmission is similar to disease transmission, based on the disease transmission model, the rumor propagation model is established. In the basic rumor propagation model, the population is divided into three categories: Ignorants (people who do not know the rumors), Spreaders (people who know and spread rumors) and Removers (people who know rumors but do not spread them). Early studies on rumor propagation took the classical Daley\u2013Kendall (DK) model in [1, 2] and Maki\u2013Thomson (MT) model in [3] as examples, which were applicable for the phenomenon of rumor propagation in small-scale social networks with direct contact. In the DK model, the authors assumed that the rumor was spread through the contact of rumor spreaders with other groups in the population. Maki and Thomson [3] modified the DK model and proposed that rumors were spread through two-way contact between the rumormongers and other people in the crowd, thus deriving the MT model.",

            "text": "In large-scale social networks, the probability of rumors spreading among individuals is diverse, and the dynamic behaviors of rumors spreading are also varied. Therefore, the study of rumors spreading mainly explores the laws between them. Zanette [4] was the first one to apply the theory of complex networks to analyze the rumor propagation, and then he studied the MT model with small-world network under dynamic and static conditions in [5], in which he found that the network structure would have a momentous impact on rumor propagation. Moreno [6] studied the rumor propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, respectively, and gave the mean field equation of rumor propagation in homogeneous and scale-free networks. Later, there are an increasing number of scholars [7\u201311] to study the rumor spreading issues in complex networks. Kawach [12] pointed out that the memory mechanism of the stifler would affect the spread of rumors and change the spread rate in the process of spreading. Zhao [13] studied the rumor propagation model with forgetting and memory mechanisms. The rumor propagation models with rational consciousness [14], psychological differences [15, 16], media reports [17], official refutation [18] and other factors were also considered. In addition, since individuals may not respond to rumors in time, [19, 20] studied the rumor propagation models with contact lag between susceptible and infected people. Since various individuals have distinct abilities to spread and absorb information, it is of greater practical significance to study the rumor propagation model [21\u201324] under heterogeneous networks. In [25], a rumor propagation model based on heterogeneous network was proposed, and two control strategies not only show a good resistance to rumor propagation, but also can effectively reduce the cost of suppressing rumor. In [26], based on a scale-free network, the authors considered the network topology with psychological factors and applied such control strategies as unified immune control, modular surface control and optimal immune control to inhibit the spread of rumors.",

At present, some achievements have been made for rumor propagation in a multilingual environment. Using multiple-group epidemic model research techniques, Wang in [27] first proposed a SIR rumor propagation model in a multilingual environment, in which all individuals were divided into different groups according to distinct languages, and a new model with a cross-propagation mechanism was established. Different from Wang\u2019s model, Li [28] established and analyzed the I2S2R rumor propagation model in the complex network and discussed the dynamics through the mean field equation. However, up to now, there is no study on rumor propagation model with heterogeneous networks in a multilingual environment.",

The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) In the multilingual environment, this paper considers the influence of immunologic mechanism on the ignorant and proposes a new I2SR rumor propagation model. (2) By using next-generation matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, the existence and global stability of rumor-free equilibrium and rumor equilibrium are analyzed. (3) In order to effectively suppress the spread of the rumor, a real-time control method on the spreaders is proposed, which can exterminate the rumor in a short time and greatly shorten the time of rumor spread. (4) It is challenging and sometimes impossible to consume limited resources to suppress rumor spreading continuously. Therefore, we propose an event-triggered impulsive control strategy. By applying the corresponding event-triggered impulsive control mechanism to the spreaders, we can effectively save control costs and guarantee the extinction of rumor.",

For the sake of convenience, we control the spreaders in each layer simultaneously. It is found that as long as the control intensity meets some certain conditions, the rumor spreaders will die out eventually. However, when the network is tremendous, it is laborious to implement the centralized event-triggered control strategy. Consequently, in the future work, we will further study the distributed event-triggered control strategy. Maybe the event-triggered condition only depends on the number of propagations in each layer of network.",

The local stability and global stability of the rumor-free equilibrium point and rumor equilibrium point are studied by means of Routh\u2013Hurwitz discriminant method and Lyapunov stability theory. In addition, two kinds of control schemes, the continuous control and event-triggered impulsive control, are proposed to restrain the spreading of the rumor. Some related conditions are obtained to suppress the spreading of the rumor. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is verified by numerical simulations.
