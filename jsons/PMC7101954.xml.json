            "text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one curative treatment for adult patients with high-risk acute leukemia or severe hematopoietic failure syndromes. Overall survival is about 40% (range 25\u201362%) for leukemia patients depending on primary disease, stage, conditioning regimens1, 2 and risk groups (range: 25% (high-risk leukemia) to 62% (good-risk leukemia)),3 and about 90% for hematopoietic failure syndrome patients.4, 5, 6 However, allo-HSCT is associated with major complications, such as severe acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) and infections.7, 8, 9 Differential diagnosis of aGvHD from treatment-related toxicities can be difficult and is mainly made according to clinical symptoms and biopsies. Thus, a method is urgently needed to diagnose early onset of aGvHD and to identify patients at risk of developing severe GvHD in an observer-independent, unbiased fashion. Depending on the type of transplantation, patient age, the immunosuppressive prophylaxis and the underlying disorders, 35\u201385% of transplanted patients develop aGvHD.7, 10, 11 First-line therapy of aGvHD consists of steroids resulting in a response rate of about 70% for patients with aGvHD grade I or II without significant increase of mortality.10 In contrast, patients developing aGvHD grades III or IV have a mortality risk of about 80\u201390% due to aGvHD-specific organ dysfunction or concomitant infections.12 Recently, proteome analysis of body fluids using capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled on-line to mass spectrometry (MS) to define differentially excreted peptides has been shown to be a powerful new diagnostic tool in a variety of diseases and is broadly applicable.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 CE-MS has been applied to identify biomarkers for early detection of aGvHD in patients undergoing allo-HSCT since 2003.18, 19, 20 We employed these biomarkers to generate an aGvHD-specific classifier, aGvHD_MS17, that allowed distinction of patients with severe aGvHD (grades III and IV) from those who never developed aGvHD, patients with low or moderate aGvHD (grades I and II) and patients with chronic GvHD (cGvHD) after allo-HSCT. In the present study, we prospectively evaluated the predictive value of aGvHD_MS17 in 423 patients who were enrolled in one of five participating transplant centers and who were transplanted between 2005 and 2010. Results obtained from aGvHD_MS17 analysis were superior to results for other biomarkers previously described for prediction or diagnosis of aGvHD, such as loss of serum albumin,21 C-reactive protein22 and plasma biomarkers.23 This report represents the largest study using proteomics in patient assessment. Our results demonstrate the predictive value, clinical usefulness and applicability of this novel diagnostic tool in post-HSCT surveillance.",

Of 423 recipients, 242 were male, 80 of those were transplanted from female donors and for 16 no information on donor gender was available. Immunosuppressive antibodies were administered to 308 (72%) patients. For 17 patients, no information regarding antibody treatment was available. Diagnosis of aGvHD was based on clinical criteria24 and on histopathology of biopsies, if available (Table 1b and c). Diagnosis of cGvHD followed criteria established in the cGvHD diagnosis and treatment consensus conferences 2007 and 2009 (ref. 25) and adapted to European needs.26 Incidence and severity of acute GvHD and information on biopsies are summarized in Tables 1b and c. Twenty-five patients died before day +100, six had aGvHD as cause of death. All patients were examined daily during hospitalization and weekly thereafter for the first 130 days post allo-HSCT. Clinical aGvHD was assessed according to the aGvHD score from grade 0 (no sign of GvHD) to IV.24",

Quantitative differences in the excretion of the pattern-forming peptides were observed upon comparison of patients without aGvHD, patients with aGvHD grade I and those with biopsy-proven aGvHD grade II or more sampled at clinical diagnosis of aGvHD (Table 2). The differences in the excretion of the peptides included in the proteomic classification model aGvHD_MS17 were converted to a numerical CF, using an SVM-based clustering software as described.19 Box-and-Whisker plot analysis of CF values in the case and control patient groups of the training set (Supplementary Table S1) demonstrated a significant difference of the aGvHD_MS17 classifier in samples from patients without aGvHD or aGvHD grade I (P<0.0001) when compared with patients with aGvHD grade II or more (Figure 1a). Analyses of 1106 samples collected from our prospective cohort provided further evidence that the proteome classifier aGvHD_MS17 can significantly distinguish patients with no aGvHD from those with aGvHD grade I (P=0.0004), grade II (P<0.0001) or grades III/IV (P<0.0001), respectively (Figure 1b). To evaluate the specificity of aGvHD_MS17, additional control samples including chronic renal failure syndromes and autoimmune diseases were analyzed with the same classifier as patients after allo-HSCT (Figure 1c). Only samples from patients after allo-HSCT with severe aGvHD were positive in aGvHD_MS17 classification. Organ manifestation of aGvHD was analyzed in the prospective set for prediction of organ involvement. aGvHD_MS17 scoring was investigated for skin, intestine or liver manifestation of aGvHD to examine possible organ-specific effects on the classification. Although no significant difference between the different manifestations could be detected (data not shown), indicating absence of organ specificity of aGvHD_MS17, involvement of more than 1 organ, which usually correlated with a higher grade of aGvHD, resulted in higher CF values (Figure 1d), as expected.",

The decreased serum albumin levels observed in our study may have resulted from the administration of immunosuppressive antibodies to 72% of our patients during conditioning (Tables 1a\u2013c). Capillary leakage syndromes are common under this conditioning therapy and may be the underlying cause of serum albumin loss in our patients independent of aGvHD. However, we detected increased urinary excretion of a specific N-terminal fragment of albumin as aGvHD progressed (Table 3). Albumin uptake in T cells was described to be associated with aGvHD development.28 Thus, our results confirm those of Rezvani et al.,21 but suggest changes in serum albumin metabolism/catabolism or possible GvHD-induced vascular damage in the kidney rather than mere intestinal loss of serum albumin as a pathological component of aGvHD.",

These biomarkers, present at the time of diagnosis of manifested aGvHD, were investigated in a multicenter trial to predict treatment response and survival of patients with aGvHD.30 Sampling was done at diagnosis of manifested aGvHD and 14 and 28 days after initiation of treatment, and the pattern could predict response to therapy and survival. However, these markers are not suitable for preemptive diagnosis of aGvHD.30 The special value of our aGvHD-specific classifier (aGvHD_MS17) is its capacity to identify patients before any clinical signs of developing aGvHD, independent of organ manifestation and at least 14 days before clinical manifestation of aGvHD. The aGvHD_MS17 classifier is in very good agreement with the gold standard for aGvHD diagnosis, namely tissue biopsies (Tables 1a\u2013c, Figure 2d). Tissue biopsy cannot be used for routine monitoring requiring repeated sampling, and its predictive value is therefore not easily assessable. Prediction of pending severe aGvHD can currently only be accomplished by the proteomic pattern. No association of specific organ manifestations of aGvHD was detectable. However, the severity of pending aGvHD, as well as manifestation of aGvHD in more than one organ, was both associated with aGvHD_MS17 scoring. In our cohort, patients with severe aGvHD had generally more than one organ involved in aGvHD, as well as a higher score in the aGvHD_MS17 classifier (Figure 1d).",

We observed increased or decreased excretion of the pattern-forming peptides. For example, increased \u03b22-microglobulin excretion may indicate cell death as aGvHD progresses in severity. In addition, we observed increased or decreased excretion of particular collagen fragments, indicating very early changes in collagen metabolism, possibly indicating inflammation and/or early vascular damage that may consequently lead to organ damage. It is well accepted that conditioning, especially with total body irradiation, leads to an inflammatory environment, which causes activation of recipient antigen-presenting cells and donor T cells. CD99, for example, is an activation marker of T cells, and excretion was decreased as aGvHD severity increased. One can speculate that in the activation state (aGvHD) turnover of CD99 may be reduced. Interestingly, the decreased excretion of the fibrinogen fragment points toward unsuccessful repair of the microdamages to the vasculature in patients prone to develop aGvHD III/IV (Table 3).",

Box-and-Whisker plot presentation showing the difference in aGvHD_MS17 classification between patients with aGvHD grade II or more compared with the controls for the training set. The training set consists of 33 samples with aGvHD grade II or more, and 76 samples from control patients. The pattern was transformed into a CF shown on the y axis using MosaCluster, an SVM-based program. MosaCluster constructs a separation hyperplane between the case and control samples of the training set in the n-dimensional aGvHD biomarker space. The result of SVM classification is a dimensionless positive or negative number termed as CF representing the Euclidian distance of a sample data point to the constructed separation hyperplane. The CF with the best sensitivity\u2013specificity ratio in receiver operating characteristic evaluation of SVM values of the training set was defined as the cut-off point, in this case CF \u2a7e0.1, and used subsequently as decision criterion for aGvHD prediction in all prospectively collected samples.
