All consecutive adults (\u2265 18 years old) hospitalized for CAP at the participating centers were enrolled in the study. The following patients were excluded from the analysis: (i) immunosuppressed patients; (ii) patients not tested for bacterial agents of CAP within 24 h of admission; (iii) patients with a diagnosis of hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Bacterial testing within 24 h of admission included the following: blood and respiratory cultures (e.g., sputum, pleural fluid, endotracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage), pneumococcus urinary antigen, Legionella urinary antigen, serology for atypical pathogens, and lung biopsy. The GLIMP coordinating center was located at the University of Texas Health, San Antonio, in San Antonio, TX, USA. The coordinating center received expedited project approval by the institutional review board (number HSC20150184E). The review board waived the need for receipt of informed consent due to the nature of the study. A detailed description of the GLIMP organization and methodology was previously published [4].",

The following bacterial tests were performed in the study population: blood cultures (2110; 82.3%), sputum cultures (1886; 73.6%), other respiratory cultures (552; 21.5%), pneumococcal urinary antigen (894; 34.9%), Legionella urinary antigen (899; 35.1%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae serology (220; 8.6%), Chlamydia pneumoniae serology (202; 7.9%), Legionella pneumophila serology (175; 6.8%), and lung biopsy (7; 0.3%). At least one bacterial pathogen was identified as the causative agent of CAP in 906 (35.3%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most prevalent pathogen, accounting for 211 (8.2%) cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the second and the third most prevalent pathogens, accounting for 105 (4.1%) and 87 (3.4%) cases, respectively. MRSA was responsible for 3.0% of CAP episodes globally, ranging from 1.2% of the cases in Portugal to 4.8% of the cases in USA and Argentina. After the stratification of non-ICU vs. ICU patients, S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae continued to be the most prevalent etiologies (Table 2). A significantly higher proportion of CAP cases was caused by MRSA in the ICU in comparison with those managed in the non-ICU setting (6.9% vs. 2.1%, p value < 0.01). Similarly, P. aeruginosa played a more relevant role in the ICU if compared with cases in the non-ICU setting (6.7% vs. 3.5%; p value < 0.01).",

The EPIC study, which was a prospective, multicenter, population-based, active surveillance study conducted by the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 2010 and 2012, enrolled 2259 adult patients hospitalized with CAP in the USA. The authors found a pathogen in only 37.7% of the cases [17\u201320]. On the contrary, in the Medicare administrative database, a pathogen was identified in 7.6% of the CAP cases [21]. When compared with previous studies, the novelty of the GLIMP approach lies in its point-prevalence design, international nature (222 centers in 54 countries in 6 continents), and the analysis of real-life data. Furthermore, the GLIMP approach differs from the Medicare database for its primary rather than administrative data collection. Several other factors may also account for the different results reported by the GLIMP study and the Medicare database. The review of the Medicare database was published in 2011 but was performed in 2009, 6 years before the GLIMP study was performed: the microbiological progress may partially justify this difference. Second, the Medicare review findings may reflect the implementation of the 2007 ATS/IDSA CAP CPGs, which discouraged any microbiological studies in most cases, and the issue of cost in the USA health care system [22]. Third, GLIMP data were derived from clinical sites, which are mostly tertiary care centers, whereas Medicare data might have included both tertiary and non-tertiary health care centers. Despite the variability of study-related characteristics, the persistently low pathogen detection yield highlights the suboptimal understanding of the dynamics of CAP etiology and the weak evidence supporting recommendations for empirical antimicrobial treatment. Therefore, studies implementing innovative pathogen-discovery approaches are urgently needed [22].",

This shift in microbiology patterns may have important implications in the antibiotic treatment guideline recommendations.

These data strengthen the need for prompt microbiological testing in severe CAP cases, as those managed in the ICU. Furthermore, the not-infrequent occurrence of MRSA and P. aeruginosa CAP in the ICU calls for the selection of empirical antimicrobials based on the evaluation of pathogen-specific risk factors and for careful antimicrobial stewardship approaches in the ICU.

Of note, when applied to the UK CAP patients, BTS CPGs appropriately covered 89.5% of the CAP cases, while ATS/IDSA and ERS CPGs covered more than 93% of the cases. Similarly, the performance of ERS CPGs was inferior to the performance of the 2019 ATS/IDSA CPGs, even when applied to European countries, such as Spain, Italy, UK, Germany, and Croatia. The suboptimal performance of country-specific CPGs in the epidemiological settings where they were meant to be applied suggests the presence of pitfalls in these CPGs. We could speculate that the following factors may have contributed to the low performance of country-specific CPGs: (i) BTS CPGs allow \u03b2-lactam monotherapy and macrolide monotherapy in the non-ICU setting, leaving uncovered atypical agents of CAP and several Gram-negative pathogens, respectively; (ii) anti MRSA and anti P. aeruginosa empirical treatments are not suggested in the ICU by the BTS CPGs; (iii) Croatian CPGs favor \u03b2-lactam monotherapy in the non-ICU setting, leaving uncovered atypical agents of CAP; (iv) differences in the identification of P. aeruginosa risk factors. Similarly, the difference between the 2019 ATS/IDSA and the ERS CPGs may be associated with the more restrictive use of anti MRSA coverage based on the ERS CPGs and with the more selective anti P. aeruginosa treatment indications based on the 2019 ATS/IDSA CPGs. In addition, the ERS recommendations attempt to provide a single set of recommendations for a large number of countries, which differ for geographic distribution, ecology, and health care system (see Electronic Supplementary Materials).",

Similar results were found when anti P. aeruginosa treatment recommendations and P. aeruginosa CAP in ICU were evaluated. The high number of anti MRSA and anti P. aeruginosa empiric therapies recommended by the CPGs should prompt future studies to better define local risk factors for MRSA and P. aeruginosa, as suggested by the 2019 ATS/IDSA CPGs. More stringent recommendations may reduce the use of unnecessary therapies, leading to a decrease in the rate of drug-related adverse events and of antimicrobial resistance.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, this is a secondary analysis of an observational point-prevalence study that cannot yield causal relationships. Second, the external validity of this study is hampered by geographic and temporal constrains. Specifically, data were mainly retrieved from tertiary care centers. Furthermore, the GLIMP study enrolled patients during the period March\u2013June 2015, in order to cover the end of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere and the start of the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere. Studies carried out during different seasons or the whole year may yield different results. Finally, the results of the GLIMP study are indicative of the testing efforts and the etiology of CAP in 2015 and cannot be generalized to any time period before or after the year 2015. Third, complete radiological and anamnestic information were not included in the original GLIMP dataset, hampering our ability to detect conditions at increased risk for anti MRSA coverage (e.g., necrotizing pneumonia and previous influenza).",
