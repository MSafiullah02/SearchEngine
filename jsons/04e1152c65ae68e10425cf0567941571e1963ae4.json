Endemic species occur in most vegetation types in Tasmania, with a particularly interesting group in cool temperate rainforest. Although only about 17y0 of the total endemic flora is involved (dicotyledons and gymnosperms only), they appear to have a diverse origin, as evidenced by the distribution of related species outside Tasmania. There is also some evidence available from the fossil record for the past distribution of the endemic rainforest species and their evolutionary relationships (e.g. Hill, 1983 Hill, , 1984 Hill & Macphail, 1983 , 1985 . The aim of this study is to consider the origins of endemic Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest species through a consideration of their relationships to other species and the known fossil record of southeastern Australia. This contrasts with the approach adopted by Kirkpatrick & Brown (1984) who formulated their hypotheses to explain the presence of endemic plant species in Tasmania from present day spatial patterns. Their hypotheses are evaluated in light of palaeobotanical and palaeoclimatic evidence. Kirkpatrick & Brown (1984) proposed two hypotheses to explain the origin of endemic species in Tasmania:",

Australia drifted northwards during the Tertiary, and so a knowledge of climatic change at this time is important in considering the first hypothesis. For a species to have a high latitude northern limit which is independent of continental movement, as proposed by Kirkpatrick & Brown (1984) , the climate must remain relatively stable with time. However, this was not the case. The Tertiary climate of Australia was influenced by the steady northward drift of Australia through a range of climatic belts, the changing surface temperature of the surrounding seas, the development of the Antarctic ice cap, and the changing continental arrangements (Galloway & Kemp, 1981; Kemp, 198 1 ) . The evidence suggests that during the Tertiary the general trend was from a low temperature gradient from equator to pole in the Early Tertiary to a steep gradient by the Late Tertiary. Therefore, as Australia drifted northward during the Tertiary, southeastern Australia experienced a decline in temperature. The evidence for this is summarized by Kemp (1981) and Galloway & Kemp (1981) . This means that any species in southeastern Australia with high latitude northern limits in the Early Tertiary would have had their range extended to lower latitudes as the climate changed during the Tertiary. This would have occurred more quickly than Australia's northward drift and therefore the species would have extended their distribution, and not become extinct as the dry land on the plate left their range as suggested by Kirkpatrick & Brown (1984) .",

Negative evidence for this hypothesis would require a demonstration that most extant Tasmanian species were present in Tasmania before glaciation began. Positive evidence would require a convincing demonstration that large numbers of ncw species were present immediately following the first glaciation. Neither of these options is practical in Tasmania, where the time of the first glaciation is still under debate. However, there is little evidence of rapid speciation in response to glaciation from other parts of the world. Other forms of evidence can be considered here. Firstly, Tasmania presently has an extremely variable topography and rainfall, and a large number of climatic niches are therefore available for plant species. A similar situation must have occurred for millions of years before the glaciations, since the mountains of Tasmania were formed prior to the 'lertiary (Ollier, 1986) . Rather than rapid speciation as a result of the onset of glaciations, it is likely that thc species growing in cool, dry areas prior to the glaciations expanded their distribution. It is known that there was a diverse microphyllous sub-alpine flora present in Tasmania b y the Early Miocene (Hill & Gibson, 1986) , which is e\\idence of species which could take advantage of cooler conditions at lower altitudes when they became available. Secondly, the evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that evolution in rainforest taxa has been very slow, and i t is probable that most, if not all rainforest species were in place prior to the onset of glaciations and survived in Tasmania during the glaciations. Kirkpatrick & Brown (1984) mentioned both extinction and speciation as important factors effecting endemism during the glacial cycles. However, since there were at least three glaciations of major proportions in Tasmania during the Quaternary (Kiernan, 1983) , but apparently little ice cover on the Australian mainland (Galloway & Kemp, 1981) , i t is unlikely that extinction would have been an important factor in rcstricting species to Tasmania.",

Hartley (1977) noted that the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania and New South Wales contain a number of genera with closely related species (Table 1, group 3) . Specimens and seedlings of these species were collected throughout their range. The areas of 5-10 leaves of herbarium specimens and glasshouse-grown plants were measured photometrically. Specimens housed in the Tasmanian Herbarium (HO) were also included in the analysis. The non-endemic Nothofagus cunninghamii and the Australian mainland species N . moorei were included for comparison, because their fossil history is relatively well documented. The aim was to determine whether the pattern of leaf size reduction in Tasmanian rainforest species is consistent, and whether it is genetically fixed. In conjunction with the fossil history of Nothofagus in southeastern Australia, this adds evidence of the past history of these rainforest species.",

Athrotaxis has also been described from the Cretaceous of Patagonia, but again cuticular preservation is lacking (Townrow, 1965) .

Diselma is one of several genera of the Cupressaceae with a restricted southern hemisphere distribution. Florin (1963) considered these genera to be relicts now occupying restricted areas. Prionotes is a monospecific genus which most authors (e.g. Arroyo, 1975) consider is most closely related to the monospecific Chilean genus Lebetanthus.

The fossil N . gunnii leaves are indistinguishable from the extant species, which suggests that N . gunnii has been extant since at least the Early Tertiary. There is no macrofossil evidence for N. gunnii on mainland Australia. Pollen possibly produced by N . gunnii ( N . fusca type) is present in Tertiary sediments from mainland Australia, but the type was produced by several species, and cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence for the presence of N . gunnii. Playford & Dettmann (1979) considered that the fossil pollen species Phyllocladidites mawsonii was produced by podocarpaceous plants identical with, or very closely related to, Lagarostrobos franklinii. This pollen type is known from the fossil record of southern Australia, New Zealand, southern South America, Antarctica and the Kerguelen Islands from the Early Cretaceous onwards. It was particularly abundant in latest Cretaceous to Eocene forest vegetation of cool to cold temperate latitudes, but appears to have become more restricted in the Miocene (Playford & Dettmann, 1979) . While this is strong evidence for the antiquity of I,. franklinii, the identification of a modern species in the Tertiary or Cretaceous on the basis of pollen morphology alone should be regarded with caution.",

Therefore in this line there was a decrease in leaf size during the Tertiary which may have been caused by declining temperatures and/or changing rainfall patterns millions of years before the onset of glaciations, giving rise to a new species in southeastern Australia. The ancestral type (N. moorei) has survived at lower latitudes. It is notable that extant N . cunningharnii has a larger leaf area in Victoria than Tasmania, although both are much smaller than -1V. moorei (Fig. 1 ) .
