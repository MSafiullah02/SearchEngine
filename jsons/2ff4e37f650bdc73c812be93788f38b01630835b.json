Orthopaedic trauma surgery has changed during the pandemic, by generally treating more patients conservatively. Emergency Orthopaedic surgeries and fracture neck of femur patients still need to be treated operatively for a better outcome. Our paper aims to give an insight into our current practice to minimise aerosol generation during these procedures, thereby reducing the risk of infection to the surgical and anaesthetic team.",

A large number of healthcare workers caring for Covid-19 patients were infected and some have died. The current advice is to take pragmatic decision making, suggests non-operative management of many injuries and reduced face to face follow up. 2 The spread of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly via droplets (aerosol), but also via direct contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites). Any personal prophylaxis needs to consider both these modes. Furthermore, one needs to consider the viral load to which the health worker is exposed which in turn influences the severity of disease, if acquired. 3 In orthopedic surgical procedures, surgical power tools, such as electrocautery, bone saws, reamers and drills, are commonly used that has shown to produce aerosol 4 . It has been postulated that virus transmission can happen through blood aerosol infecting the health care professionals. 5 We describe the current practice that we have adopted to reduce the aerosol production while treating patients surgically.",
