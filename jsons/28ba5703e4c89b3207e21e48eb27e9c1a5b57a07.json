Schools have closed down, and the need of commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector has also seen a great demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products.

The result of which is newer restrictions being made to provide food only to those in greatest need. (97, 98) In response to these concerns, the UK government has made efforts to provide certain populations with food parcels and free meals to collect and take home. These populations include high-risk vulnerable individuals such as the elderly who have no support network, and school children of low-income families.

Production slow-downs and limitations in supply would inadvertently lead to revenue loss. (61) In the UK, AstraZeneca have indicated that COVID-19 is likely to affect its 2020 revenue growth. Conversely, opportunities for companies engaged in vaccine and drug development have simultaneously emerged, with US-based companies including Johnson & Johnson, Vir Biotechnology, Novavax and NanoViricides having announced collaborative plans to develop a viral vaccine. A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational COVID-19 vaccine is currently underway, and will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over and travel industry have perhaps been most hard-hit, with hourly workers facing potential devastating hardships. Marriott International with approximately 174,000 employees is poised to place tens of thousands of workers on furlough. (63) Hilton Worldwide has also notified lenders on 5th March 2020 borrowing a precautionary $1.75 billion under a revolving loan to preserve money and to maintain flexibility \"in light of uncertainty in the global markets\". (64) Hotel industry revenue per available room in the United States fell 11.6% for the week ending 7th March 2020, whilst in China occupancy rates fell 89% by the end of January 2020. Other United States hotel companies are seeking approximately $150 billion in direct aid for employees due to an unprecedented fall in demand, along with an estimated $1.5 billion loss since mid-February. (65) MGM Resorts International have also announced a temporary suspension in operation at its Las Vegas properties, with casino operations closing on 16th March, followed by hotel operations. (66) Since 1st March 2020, hotel occupancy in Germany decreased by over 36%. (67) Italian cities including Rome have been inadvertently affected with a current occupancy rate of 6%, whilst London remains the most stable with an occupancy rate of approximately 47%. (67) Overall, the COVID-19 crises has led to international distortions for the hospitality industry, and significant slumps for the European hotel market. Tourism The tourism sector is currently one of the hardest-hit by the outbreak of COVID-19, with impacts on both travel supply and demand. As a direct consequence of COVID-19, The World Travel and Tourism Council has warned that 50 million jobs in the global travel and tourism sector may be at risk. (68) In Europe, the European Tourism Manifesto alliance, encompassing over 50 European public and private organisations from the travel and tourism sector, have highlighted the need to implement urgent measures. These include temporary state aid for the tourism and travel sector from national governments, fast and easy access to short-and medium-term loans to overcome liquidity shortages, including funds made available by the EU through the Corona Response Investment Initiative, and fiscal relief. (69) The alliance has also called for the launch of the European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme. (70) Internationally, Vietnam received approximately 1.45 million Chinese visitors in the first quarter of 2019, dropping by 644,000 in January of 2020. It is estimated that Vietnam's tourist sector will suffer a $5 billion loss should the COVID-19 pandemic extend into the second quarter of 2020.(71) Moreover, the Philippines is projecting a 0.3-0.7% slowdown in the country's full year GDP. (72) In the United States, restriction of all non-essential travel, US-Canada border closure, (73) and the suspension of visa services (74) may accelerate disruption of the American economy. In the UK, many parks are now closing to further enforce social distancing as they have in Italy. (75) Aviation The travel industry is grappling with an unprecedented wave of cancellations and a significant drop in demand amid strict governmental instructions to implement social distancing and the restriction of unnecessary travel. Globally, border closures are on the rise. In the US, all foreign nationals from China, Iran, certain EU countries are barred from entering. (76) This ban includes anyone who visited these countries within the 14 days prior to their US trip. The UK Foreign Office has also advised UK nationals against all but essential international travel. (77) In Europe, the president of the EU commission has proposed all non-essential travel from outside the EU be suspended for 30 days. Travel suspensions have similarly been implemented across Asia and Africa. (78) In light of these events, Malaysia Airport reported a 30% decline in international passenger traffic for February. (79) More recently, Airlines for America sought a government bailout encompassing $25 billion in grants, $25 billion in loans, and significant tax relief to ensure survival. (80) UK airlines have also called for an immediate \u00a37.5 billion emergency bailout to prevent a widespread shutdown. (81) Ministers in the Netherlands have also reported implementing strategies to ensure the continued operation of Air France-KLM and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, whilst the Italian Government have been said to be close to taking full control of ailing airline Alitalia. 4.5. Real estate and housing sector The real estate industry is facing great uncertainty due to COVID-19. At an individual level social distancing precautions have reduced house views, a key part of the selling process, and both buyers and sellers are having to reconsider their plans. Increasingly, sellers are looking for reassurance regarding the health of potential buyers coming to view properties. (82) Some brokers are offering house tours via Skype and FaceTime to minimise the risk of infection propagation. Brokers around the United States are also asking potential buyers to preregister for viewings in order to gauge their level of interest and likelihood of purchase. (83) Additionally, thousands of workers around the world have been made redundant or have been placed on temporary, unpaid leave of absence. Inevitably this will have a significant impact on individuals' abilities to pay rent, mortgages and various household expenditures. To tackle this, part of the \u00a3350bn lifeline the United Kingdom (UK) government has released will be used to allow mortgage lenders to offer a three-month mortgage holiday to those in financial difficulty. (47) The government has also recommended that buyers and lenders delay negotiations during the lockdown, bringing transactions to a halt. (84) Many are worried that we will face another financial crisis, similar to that of 2008 that will impact confidence in real estate. Banks within the UK have begun to take precautions; high street lenders require up to 40% deposits or equity for a new mortgage to be approved. It is however too early to speculate on the impact of COVID-19; as of yet, the infection has not had a significant impact on the housing market. (86) 4.6. Sports industry COVID-19 is having a significant impact on sporting schedules as some of the world's largest sporting events come to view in 2020. Football's much anticipated Euro 2020 tournament has been postponed for 12 months while play-offs have been postponed till June 2020 at the earliest. (87) The international Olympic committee was committed to staging the Tokyo 2020 Olympics this summer without delay. However, they have now made the decision to postpone the games to 2021, a decision that is supported by athletes ans their respective nations. (87-89) In a similar vein, the Australian Formula one Grand Prix has been postponed with Bahrain and Vietnam opting to cancel their fixture until further notice. (87) These are but a few examples; golf, tennis, athletics, basketball, rugby, cycling, boxing, snooker and ice-skating fixtures have all faced cancellations and delays in an attempt to curb the spread of disease.",
