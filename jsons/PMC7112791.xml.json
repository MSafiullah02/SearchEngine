            "text": "The measurement of seroneutralizing antibodies has been used commonly for many years to assess the level of immunity to rabies (Aubert, 1992, Cliquet et al., 1998) and a virus-neutralizing antibody titer of 0.5 IU/ml in sera is the threshold of seroconversion to rabies vaccination as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Detection and quantitation of antibodies against rabies virus (RABV) are also of prime importance for assessing the efficacy of rabies vaccination campaigns. The rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) (Smith et al., 1973) and the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test (Cliquet et al., 1998) are the only in vitro methods recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for measuring virus neutralizing antibodies. However, such assays require a considerable level of expertise and are generally undertaken only in reference laboratories with suitable biocontainment facilities. In addition, the procedures are time-consuming, and only a limited number of samples can be processed at one time. They are therefore inefficient and expensive for human and animal clinics in developing countries without trained personnel. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: first, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test; and second, to overcome financial and logistical barriers that prevent implementation of a test in the developing countries with the greatest need (Fooks et al., 2009). A more convenient and affordable diagnostic test for antibodies against rabies virus should be developed in countries where rabies is endemic and where resources are limited.",

            "text": "The immunochromatographic assay, also referred to as lateral flow device or simply a strip assay, is a technique in which a cellulose membrane is used as the carrier and a colloidal gold-labeled antigen or antibody is used as the tracer (Zhang et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2009a, Zhang et al., 2009b). Although this method has only been used for qualitative analysis so far, it provides rapid detection of antigens and antibodies, and thus possesses advantages over the conventional immunoassays, such as low cost, inexpensive equipment, simplicity of procedure, rapid operation, and long-term stability over a wide range of environmental conditions. These characteristics render a test ideally suited for on-site testing by untrained personnel (Peng et al., 2007). Immunogold labeling has been applied widely for diagnosis of infection and for antibody detection (Cui et al., 2008, Hedstrom et al., 1998, Mikawa et al., 2009, Oku et al., 2001, Smits et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2010). A rapid immunochromatographic test kit for rabies virus detection was developed and evaluated using clinical samples. The kit provides a simple and rapid method for detection of infection with rabies (Kang et al., 2007, Nishizono et al., 2008). In the present study, a rapid, one-step immunochromatographic test strip capable of detecting specifically rabies virus antibodies in serum was developed.",

MNA cells were infected with CVS-11 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, and incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 4 d. Culture fluid was collected, cells were removed by centrifugation (1500 \u00d7 \ng, 20 min, 4 \u00b0C), and the virus was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 \u00d7 \ng for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and left overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Beta-propiolactone (BPL, Sigma, Inc.) was added to the virus solution to a final BPL dilution of 1:3000. Incubation continued overnight at 4 \u00b0C, followed by 2 h at 37 \u00b0C to permit complete hydrolysis of the remaining BPL. Inactivated virus was then layered over a sucrose gradient and pelleted by ultracentrifugation (61,000 \u00d7 \ng, 90 min, 4 \u00b0C). The pelleted virus was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing EDTA (0.13 M NaCl/0.05 M Tris, pH 7.2/0.001 M EDTA). The glycoprotein was dissociated from the virus by incubation (1 h, 24 \u00b0C) with 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline. The soluble G protein fraction was separated from the residual suspension by sedimentation of the latter into a 25% sucrose cushion (55,000 \u00d7 \ng, 160 min) and was collected by aspiration of the layer just above the cushion. After dialysis against a phosphate buffer (PB, 20 mM pH 7.2), Sephadex G-50 (GE Healthcare, UK) filtration was used to remove excess ampholine. Then the G protein was dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffer (PB, 20 mM pH 7.2) and stored in aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C until used. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce, Inc., Rockford, IL).",

Rabies virus glycoprotein is the only structural protein of the virus that induces the formation of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which confer immunity to animals. The protective activity was shown to be associated only with the G protein and not with the membrane associated protein M and P, although they contain residual traces of G protein (Cox et al., 1977). Competitive ELISA that utilizes a cell line stably expressing the rabies virus G protein as the coating antigen has higher specificity and sensitivity than that of ELISA based on whole rabies virus antigen (Bahloul et al., 2005, Servat and Cliquet, 2006). Also, there is an excellent agreement between the FAVN test and competitive ELISA. In the study presented here, the virus was cultured at 32 \u00b0C for 4 d, and this was sufficient to obtain more G protein than virus grown at 37 \u00b0C. In order to reduce the false-positive results, sucrose gradient centrifugation was used to purify the virus. Subsequently the G protein was dissociated from the purified virus by incubation with Triton X-100, which could have a higher biological and protective activity than that solubilized by deoxycholate or by Nonidet P-40 (Cox et al., 1977). The sensitivity and specificity of ICTS in this study did not produce any difference between serum samples derived from dogs vaccinated with inactivated Pasteur virus (PV) strain, inactivated Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth (ERA) strain, Flury-LEP vaccines and commercial vaccines (Intervet Nobivac) (Table 1), and there was also an excellent correlation with the FAVN test.

However, they have different affinities to immunoglobulin with different isotypes. Also, the binding capacity with immunoglobulin of SPA differs between mammalian species. In this study, SPA was immobilized on the membrane and used as the test line, and it showed high affinity to serum samples from dogs. In addition, the ICTS can also be used to detect serum samples positive for rabies virus derived from humans, cats, rabbits and mice, but the sensitivity varies (data not shown). The ICTS showed higher sensitivity when detecting sera from canine, human and rabbit, and a relatively lower sensitivity for detection of mouse and cat sera. Therefore, the ICTS may also be useful in serosurveillance with these species.",

False-negative results occurred with the ICTS test for samples possessing virus neutralizing antibodies \u22650.5 IU/ml, which implies that the sera did not have an adequate level of neutralizing antibody. The isotype of RABV-specific antibody from those serum samples was detected by ELISA, and it was shown that the isotype of those antibodies was IgM, but not IgG (data not shown). Since SPA has higher binding affinity with IgG than IgM, this may explain why those samples did not produce a positive result when tested by ICTS. Among 390 samples with virus neutralizing antibody titer < 0.5 IU/ml, only 7 samples were positive by ICTS. However, the virus neutralizing antibody titer of those samples ranged from 0.45 to 0.49 IU/ml. Sera derived from subjects which were unvaccinated or had received other vaccines such as CDV, CPV, CAV, CCV, CPIV did not show false-positive results when tested by ICTS. This result indicates that the ICTS is specific for sera against rabies virus.",

            "text": "To date, some ELISAs or competitive ELISAs (c-ELISAs) have been developed to test serum samples and compare the results with the RFFIT or FAVN test (Bahloul et al., 2005, Cliquet et al., 2004, Muhamuda et al., 2007, Servat and Cliquet, 2006, Servat et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2009a, Zhang et al., 2009b). Those methods are simple and rapid for clinical use. However, they are still not suitable for use outside the research laboratory because of the requirement of special equipment such as a microplate reader or incubator. A RAPId Neutralizing Antibody (RAPINA) test has been described for quantitatively measuring neutralizing antibody against rabies virus (Shiota et al., 2009). In this method, serum is incubated with inactivated rabies virus, and then used for a RABV G detection kit based on the principle of immunochromatography as described previously (Nishizono et al., 2008). In comparison with ELISAs, the RAPINA has an advantage of convenience, safety and rapidity. No special equipment, cultured cells, live virus, or trained operators are needed, and the results are easy to read. Sera with virus neutralizing antibody titers \u2265 0.5 IU/ml could neutralize the rabies virus and would not produce a test line; however, sera with titers < 0.5 IU/ml would not inhibit the band formation on the test line when detected by the RABV G detection kit. In the ICTS, 50 \u03bcl serum sample was applied to the test, two red-purple lines on the membrane indicate that the serum sample possesses a virus neutralizing antibody titer \u2265 0.5 IU/ml. If only one line appears at the control location, the serum sample is negative for rabies virus or has a virus neutralizing antibody titer < 0.5 IU/ml. Also, the stronger the test line appears, the more virus specific antibodies are present in the sample. It should be pointed out that one disadvantage of ICTS is that the intensity of the test lines could reach to a plateau when test the serum samples with titers higher than 8.0 IU/ml. This is because the amounts of colloidal gold-RABV G dispensed onto the fiberglass and Staphylococcal protein A immobilized on the membrane are constant, and even though more virus neutralizing antibodies are present in the sample, the colloidal gold-RABV G-RABV antibody complex trapped by the Staphylococcal protein A immobilized at the test line is limited, so the color cannot become stronger. In this case, the serum sample should be diluted further.",
