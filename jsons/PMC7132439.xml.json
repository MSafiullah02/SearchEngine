Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in prevalence and is predominantly associated with skin and soft tissue infections.2, 3 Cutaneous abscesses and cellulites are particularly common.4, 5 CA-MRSA appears to be more virulent than methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA). In a prospective observational study of 812 US Army soldiers, the baseline prevalence of CA-MRSA colonization was 3%. Soft-tissue infections developed in 9 of the colonized individuals (38%). In contrast, 28% were colonized with MSSA, and only 8 of the latter group (3%) developed clinical infections.6\n",

Unfortunately, sensitivity to tetracycline and sulfa are often not reported by the laboratory. Some of the barriers to reporting are regulatory in nature and must be addressed. The newly formed Institute for Quality in Laboratory Medicine, a partnership representing the governmental and professional organizations involved in the establishment of benchmarks for quality in health care, has the potential to help address some of these issues. The American Academy of Dermatology, a member organization of the Institute for Quality in Laboratory Medicine, should act as a vocal advocate for our patients in seeking regulatory relief that would allow the reporting of all antibiotic sensitivities important to patient care.",

Because of this risk, and to prevent school outbreaks of measles, there was a change in recommendations for measles vaccination in the United States in 1989, with a series of two injections currently recommended.

Antifungicidal synergism has been described between the azoles and the calcineurin inhibitors, and animal studies have demonstrated a therapeutic benefit in the setting of fungal infection.57 It is intriguing to imagine the effects of combination induction therapy for psoriasis using both a biological and a calcineurin inhibitor.

Together, the data could provide early warning of the use of a biological weapon or predict the start of an epidemic. The Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) is one such surveillance system that operates in the Washington DC area.63 The ESSENCE system is an early step in what should ultimately be a global network to track unusual and emerging pathogens.",
