There are characteristics shared by all viruses that set them apart from other self-replicating systems. Viruses are obligate molecular parasites that rely on only one type of genomic material (either DNA or RNA) and use a proteinaceous genome package to facilitate dispersal. While viruses are not metabolically active organisms, their phenotypic variation results in differential replication success, thereby ensuring they are subject to the laws of evolution. Virus taxa, like organisms more frequently investigated evolutionarily, clearly change through time and to profound degrees. Unlike the cellular \u201cmacrobiota,\u201d however, our observations of viral transformation are very direct and never from examination of a large-scale past timeline such as the fossil record. If observed proportions of certain character state changes in viruses were applied to megafauna, hypotheses regarding the amount of time required to manufacture these changes would most likely be on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Yet critical changes in such factors as host range (habitat), capsid and envelope proteins (morphology), and life-history characters are common in some viruses within the time of a typical research project.",

In other words, the fundamental nature of selection is not influenced by organism complexity (fitness must always move \u201cuphill\u201d), yet the character of selective pressure is determined by an organism's necessities for survival. It could also be argued that, because of the limited sequence space of viral genomes, the high probability of genetic drift during transmission bottlenecks, extremely large population sizes, and (at least for many RNA viruses) the high mutation and recombination rates, viruses exhibit greater mobility through the space of their selective or adaptive environments than do more complex organisms (Moya, 1997).",

Investigation of the evolutionary ecology of viruses seeks to explain observed patterns of viral diversity by invoking mechanisms that take into account evolutionary response to the environment(s) in which they exist. Such research relies (heavily) on very disparate areas of science. For instance, mere description of such fundamental virus characteristics as appearance, life cycle, and tissue tropism is only possible through the tools of biochemistry and molecular biology. Answers regarding virus population dynamics such as growth and size fluctuation are often provided by epidemiological research. And evolutionary interpretation and prediction are formulated using concepts of theoretical population biology. This area of inquiry is quite young and is destined to expand with increasing sophistication in data collection and in analytical methods and technology, the exponentially growing database of molecular information, and the continual emergence of viruses as pathogens.",

Traditionally, this change is measured as a statistical difference in some population parameter(s) between separate generational cohorts of a given taxonomic group (usually population or species). The direction and extent of this change is determined by a combination of stochastic and environmental factors that are specific for a given time, space, and taxon. Therefore, the offspring of individuals or groups selected for reproduction in one biological circumstance are by no means guaranteed to thrive in the following generation since the selective environment may be slightly or radically different. An admittedly poorly defined and at times controversial evolutionary term, adaptation essentially refers to characters that arise and persist as a result of such selection and thus confer upon their bearers the ability to succeed genetically in a specific environment. Adaptation can also refer to the actual process of acquiring such traits. Many different levels of characters can thus be considered as adaptations: point mutations, coding region products, multigene assemblages, behavioral traits, and even populational characters may all endow their possessors with reproductive advantage and thus evolutionary persistence.",

R\n0 is a conceptually convenient metric, especially when considering the absolute fitness of an organism (for instance, the potential for occupation of a host population by a specific virus) but may be misleading when interpreted as a measure of relative fitness since alone it provides no information about individual reproductive rate compared to the population reproductive rate over the same time-span. The competing virus with the highest R\n0 can have the highest probability of long-term survival, but determining this probability for an individual would require comparison of all relevant R\n0s in a population or group. Therefore, R\n0 for an individual can be greater than 1 (implying \u201creproductive success\u201d), but this provides no information about individual performance with respect to population growth as a whole.

Giske and colleagues (1993) have described a particularly useful relative fitness term (\u03a6) that measures an individual's reproductive output relative to that of its population as the difference between \u03c1 and r. Therefore, \u03a6 is a measure of fitness that is both instantaneous in real time and relative. As such, any positive value of \u03a6 indicates increasing proportional representation of a particular phenotype in a population even when R\n0 < 1 or \u03c1 < 0, provided r is sufficiently small. Relative fitness in this sense is both more accurate since it accounts for variation in generation length and perhaps more applicable since it describes an individual's reproductive performance in light of that for its population as a whole.",

This is demonstrated by the observation that in most viral infections less than 1% of the susceptible host tissue is actually infected (Griffin, 1997). However, the ecological concept of metapopulation dynamics may have some application in this case. This notion assumes that populations are spatially structured so that they are actually aggregates of smaller, local subpopulations, and that migration between these subpopulations is significant enough to influence local dynamics (Hanski and Simberloff, 1997).

This accumulation of both viral particles and non-infectible cells would result in isolated competition and subsequently produce selection for either quick and successful cell invasion or dispersal to more fertile areas. Successful dispersal may give rise to other local subpopulations and result in similar selective pressures.

More recently, Winkler and colleagues (1998) discovered a human polymorphism in the stromal-derived factor (SDF-1) gene that delays the onset of AIDS in patients homozygous for a variant allele. It is thought that the variant upregulates the expression of SDF-1, which is a ligand for the CXCR4 cell receptor. The CD4 molecule and this cell surface protein act together as coreceptors for T-tropic HIV strains that normally arise late in infection. Competitive interference from the increased presence of SDF-1 may actually be protecting susceptible cells from HIV binding and subsequent endocytosis, thereby postponing disease symptoms. Receptor specificity can thus have profound implications for the pathogenicity and evolutionary expansion of viruses into new tissue types and host ranges and will be discussed later.",

Furthermore, it may be additionally advantageous to select among all the possible transport receptors those that can internalize the given virus type most effectively.

A mammalian target immune cell of viral replication for which a great deal of research has been undertaken is the T lymphocyte. Lentiviruses are particularly known to infect T cells in humans (see Table I) as well as in other mammals, but other viruses such as some herpesviruses may also infect these cells. Such infection frequently results in abnormal proliferation of T cells. T-cell growth resulting from HTLV-1 infection, for example, is known to impair immunologic function, but the subsequent effect on viral population growth is unknown. HIV is also known to have profound effects on host immune function, mainly through its replication within CD4+ T cells and monocytes, which is a likely contributor to the high viremia exhibited during the final stages of infection. In this case, the utilization of immune cells may not be as beneficial ecologically as it might appear, and for a very simple reason; that is, while the destruction of CD4+ cells may promote viral replication by decreasing antiviral pressure, it simultaneously diminishes the amount of reproductive substrate available for replication (see above).",

One such strategy is well exemplified by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice. In this system, viruses that infect adult mice are effectively cleared from the host principally by way of an LCMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response (Zinkernagel and Welsh, 1976; Byrne and Oldstone, 1984; Moskophidisy et al., 1987; Ahmed et al., 1988; Matloubian et al., 1994). Mice that are infected in utero or perinatally, however, retain high lifelong titers of infectious LCMV throughout their bodies. This persistence is made possible by the lack of a specific CTL-mediated antiviral response due to clonal deletion of LCMV-specific T cells during mouse ontogeny (Buchmeier et al., 1980; Ahmed et al., 1984; Moskophidis et al., 1987; Pircher et al., 1989; Jamieson et al., 1991).

For instance, many types of herpesviruses (varicella zoster, herpes simplex) lie latent in nonreplicating sensory neurons that are poorly penetrated by the immune system. These viruses may periodically move through axons to epithelial or ophthalmic sites for replication (where they may eventually be suppressed by the immune response) but never actually leave the host permanently. Some viruses will replicate within tissues that experience little or no exposure to antiviral host defenses. Human polyomaviruses BK and JC as well as cytomegalovirus benefit from limited T-cell effectiveness within kidney epithelial tissue by replicating there and thus avoid destruction quite efficiently (Ahmed et al., 1997).",

Once a variant rises in frequency, the probability that it will be recognized by a predator species (or host immune system) increases accordingly, and thus its growth rate will be reduced, usually to the advantage of (immunologically) less conspicuous mutants. It is in this way that the virus evades contact with antiviral components and persists within a host as a heterogeneous population.

Intrahost transport is perhaps most \u201cextreme\u201d in systemic plant viruses since distances can be very large (e.g., as in coniferous trees), and this subject has been investigated (for reviews, see Carrington et al., 1996; Deom et al., 1992; Maule, 1991; Mushegian and Koonin, 1993). Long-distance movement in plant viruses usually takes place in the sieve elements and cells of the phloem. Plant viruses are known to utilize movement proteins (MPs) that facilitate both cell-to-cell and long-distance transport. MPs have been identified in many plant viruses, but the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved unfortunately are largely unknown. MPs are frequently capsid proteins, as has been demonstrated in tobacco mosaic virus (Dawson et al., 1988; Saito et al., 1990), red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus (Xiong et al., 1993; Vaewhongs and Lommel, 1995), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) (Taliansky and Garcia-Arenal, 1995), and tobacco etch potyvirus (Dolja et al., 1994, 1995), among others. Replication proteins such as those involved in genome duplication have also been identified as necessary for long-distance movement in brome mosaic virus (Traynor et al., 1991) and CMV (Gal-On et al., 1994).",

Under such circumstances, natural selection might favor a reproductive strategy in which a resident virus population exists at low, persistent concentrations during most of the year but \u201cturns on\u201d high-level replication in order to be shed during a time of year when transmission probability is consistently (and predictably) highest.

Intrahost selective pressure may be compared with that within a species ecosystem. In an overall sense, resources require optimal, not maximal, consumption. On an individual level, negative interspecific interactions (predation) should be minimized and reproductive rates high. Just as with cellular species, viral traits that may arise or be selected for in one particular environmental scenario (time and place) do not guarantee indefinite evolutionary stability. Selective pressure within a particular host may similarly be contradictory to selective pressure imposed by requirements of interhost long-term survival. For instance, as with cellular species, where ecological continuance will not occur under conditions of resource overexploitation, virus populations will not persist evolutionarily when host resources are consumed beyond the point of sustainability. The effect is a balance between adaptations that allows sufficient harvest of host tissue without jeopardizing prospective abundance of the host as a source of reproductive substrate.",

It is first useful to partition the total host population into the number of individuals who are susceptible to viral infection (X), those who are infected and infectious (Y), and those recovered from infection that are permanently immune to subsequent infection (Z). We can show how these respective subpopulations change using simple differential equations (after Anderson and May, 1991; Garnett and Antia, 1994; Bulmer, 1994) that resemble Eqs.

However, the reality of virus\u2013host biology is that transmission is generally positively and host recovery negatively related to virus density, and as virus density increases so too does pathogenicity/mortality.",

In almost all models of parasite ecology it is assumed that, while transmission coefficients increase as intrahost parasite (virus) density increases, this relationship is rarely linear. However, host mortality (or morbidity) will occur near some threshold virus density, at which point the de facto transmission of intrahost viruses is zero. The effect is a balancing of pathogenic effects and overall transmission that is closely related to conditions in the host population.",

Extensive virus-induced diminishment of the host population resulted in evolutionarily stable emergence of a less virulent myxomavirus strain (see Fig. 4\n). In this instance, myxomavirus strains of high virulence killed their hosts too soon after inoculation and as a result were transmitted to new hosts infrequently since transmission occurs via a mosquito vector that only feeds on live rabbits. Strains of very low virulence also exhibit an interhost fitness disadvantage because they are usually cleared by host antiviral defenses before their populations reached sizes necessary for mounting of effective transmission stages (B in Fig. 1). From this example the influence of host population structure can be seen. That is, levels of virulence are often determined by (and proportional to) the frequency with which interhost transmission opportunities arise, so that low virulence can typically be selected for when host-host contact is infrequent and vice versa (Bull, 1994). Myxomavirus virulence is discussed in more detail below.",

Evidence does exist in support of such a continuum in nematode parasites of fig wasps (Herre, 1993) and mosquito microsporidian parasites (Ewald and Schubert, 1989). But this has never been demonstrated in viruses, despite the existence of numerous viral groups that rely on both modes of transmission (e.g., roseplant, citrus, HIV, HTLV).

Thus, HTLV-1 is an example of a parasite that employs an alternative life history to that of a more opportunistic replicator like MeV. HTLV-1 manages to keep R\n0 > 1 by exhibiting a very low transmission probability while remaining relatively unobtrusive within its host for a very long time. This long period of infectiousness will probably, but not necessarily, result in transmission to a new host(s). There is thus heterogeneity in an HTLV-1 population's overall transmission but not so much that it is lost from a host population, because this variance is counteracted by HTLV-1\u2032s host availability (susceptibility) and its protracted \u201csit and quietly wait\u201d intrahost replication tactics.",

They are found only in endoparasitic wasp species of the families Brachonidae and Ichneumonidae. PDV genomes are integrated throughout the chromosomes of both male and female wasps (Fleming and Krell, 1993) and are only transmitted vertically in Mendelian fashion (Fleming and Krell, 1993; Stoltz, 1990). The viruses replicate exclusively within cells of the female's ovarian calyx during a specific stage in development and are subsequently released into the oviduct (Fleming and Summers, 1986, 1991; Fleming and Krell, 1993; Webb and Summers, 1992). During oviposition within a susceptible larval lepidopteran host, the eggs are coated with viral particles and thus transferred into the host body cavity (Vinson, 1977a; Norton and Vinson, 1977; Vinson and Scott, 1974, 1975). Once inside the lepidopteran, PDV genes are expressed in various tissues (Fleming and Krell, 1993; Blissard et al., 1986a,b, 1989; Strand et al., 1992; Theilman and Summers, 1986, 1988; Harwood and Beckage, 1994; Harwood et al., 1994), but no further viral replication takes place (Stoltz, 1990; Blissard et al., 1989; Strand et al., 1992).",

It has been shown that PDVs alone (or in combination with wasp venom) provide these functions that are actually essential to reproduction of their parasitoid hosts (Asgari et al., 1997; Shelby and Webb, 1997; Vinson, 1977b; Davies et al., 1987; Davies and Vinson, 1988; Vinson and Stoltz, 1986; Edson et al., 1980; Vinson et al., 1979; Guzo and Stoltz, 1985; Kitano, 1982, 1986; Stoltz et al., 1988; Tanaka, 1987; Tanaka and Vinson, 1991). PDV replication within the wasp is highly localized both in space and time and essentially causes no significant adverse organismal effects (Fleming and Summers, 1986; Norton and Vinson, 1983; Theilmann and Summers, 1986).

The co-occurrence of the existent host population structures and environmental conditions may alone be conducive to direct transmission of viruses in general, but the large presence of the mosquito must contribute substantially to its utilization in virus transmission. Not surprisingly, YFV transmission is known to increase with increased fecundity, longevity, and density of Ae. aegypti (Monath, 1989). In fact, indices exist that use mosquito presence and activity to measure risk of yellow fever epidemic (Service, 1974; Bang et al., 1979, 1981; Monath, 1989).",

Also, high mutation rates of many RNA viruses may likewise hasten ascension of adaptive peaks (Eigen and Biebricher, 1988).

Other determinants of natural host range include antiviral capabilities as well as more \u201cinconstant\u201d host characteristics that may influence sustainable transmission such as population size, spatiotemporal population structure, habitat usage, diet, and behavior.",

            "text": "Some virus types appear to rely on more than one nonvector host species for normal maintenance. An excellent and well-investigated example of this is influenza A, which is naturally perpetuated through populations of many wild birds (especially aquatic species), wherein it is rarely pathogenic despite the fact that all the known subtypes are represented (Hinshaw et al., 1980; Alexander, 1986). Strains of influenza A (especially H1N1) have been known to move between swine and humans (Webster et al., 1992; Hinshaw et al., 1978; Schnurrenburger et al., 1970) and are all but conclusively determined as being derived from avian reservoirs (Webster et al., 1992, 1995). Influenza A is also found in many other vertebrate species, including horses and sea mammals, and, based on serological and phylogenetic analysis, it is thought that interspecies transmission is frequent in these cases as well (Gorman et al., 1991; Webster et al., 1992, 1995). Thus, influenza A is capable of existence in more than one species and is quite frequently transmitted between species. This characteristic is thought to be related to the mutability of its genome through reassortment and rapid mutation accumulation (Scholtissek et al., 1977, 1978, 1993; Scholtissek, 1995; Yamnikova et al., 1993; Reinacher et al., 1983; Domingo and Holland, 1994) and thus may not be as common in DNA viruses or viruses with nonsegmented genomes.",

For example, feline panleuk-openia virus (FPV) is incapable of sustained replication outside its normal host range. Canine parvovirus (CPV) is strongly suspected as being derived from FPV since it is genetically very similar and is capable of replication in both canines and felines. CPV did not exist before the late 1970s and spread worldwide in less than two years (Parrish et al., 1988). CPV and FPV differ in only three amino acids of their VP2 capsid proteins: position 93 is asparagine in CPV and lysine in FPV; position 103 is alanine in CPV and valine in FPV; and position 323 is asparagine in CPV and aspartic acid in FPV (Parrish, 1997). Using site-directed mutagenesis, Parrish (1997) was able to demonstrate that CPV viruses that were otherwise normal but contained lysine at position 93 were able to replicate in feline cells but lost their ability to replicate in canine cells. Furthermore, otherwise normal FPV that contained asparagine at positions 93 and 323 were able to replicate in both canine and feline cells. It is highly probable that these latter two mutations represent a key ecological innovation that recently facilitated parvoviral occupation of a new host niche and therefore enabled rapid (and extensive) spread of parvovirus into the world population of canines.",

In addition, during the normal course of HIV infection, different tissue-tropic strains may arise that are distinguishable from their parental viruses not only by the tissue from which they are retrieved but also by their phenotypes and genotypes. For instance, HIV isolates collected from blood are very capable of syncytia formation and are also T-cell tropic. Those collected from bowel tissue are only slightly capable of syncytia formation and only slightly T-cell tropic. However, HIV collected from brain tissue seem incapable of syncytia formation and are not T-cell tropic (Barnett et al., 1991; Cheng-Meyer et al., 1989).

Care must therefore be used when interpreting viral evolutionary change as adaptive, that is, whether a viral group has diversified due to the acquisition of expanded reproductive abilities driven by ecological obstacles or openings presented to it, or merely because of the probabilistic conditions of its existence. It is necessary to authenticate the presence of synapomorphic adaptive characters that provide some specific, selected function to conclusively demonstrate that viral adaptation is the source of a phylogenetic radiation.",

To accomplish this, they used quantitative relative fitness assays to measure fitness changes in VSV populations that initially were competitively equal. When sequentially passaged together, one of the VSV populations was inevitably totally displaced by the other. \u201cWinner\u201d and \u201closer\u201d strains were then mixed with the ancestral wild-type strains to examine absolute fitness changes. In all cases, the derived virus populations were able to outcompete and displace their ancestral populations.

She maintains that BYDV\u2013PAV may be winning an evolutionary battle because of its interactions with aphid vector species that are favoring higher transmission rates. For instance, BYDV\u2013PAV can potentially use more than one aphid species for transmission (Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi), whereas BYDV\u2013MAV only uses S. avenae. In addition, R. padi was found to be a more efficient transmitter of virus than S. avenae (Gray et al., 1991; Power et al., 1991). Morphological alteration of vectors as a result of viral infection may also be enhancing the spread of BYDV\u2013PAV. Aphids are polymorphic species, having both winged and nonwinged adults. Gildow (1980, 1983) has shown that R. padi and S. avenae adults are winged with significantly higher frequency when feeding on BYDV\u2013infected plants. Furthermore, S. avenae adults were found (in separate experiments) to be more frequently winged when feeding on BYDV\u2013PAV-infected plants than when feeding on BYDV\u2013MAV-infected plants (Gildow, 1980). Power et al. (1991) point out that the competitive benefits of such viral-induced changes may include increased vector dispersal, which may therefore provide BYDV\u2013PAV with a transmission advantage over BYDV\u2013MAV.",

However, intertaxonomic competition in the presence of more than one fundamental niche may result in alteration (including expansion or contraction) of the niches used by the individual competing populations.

Such forms of indirect competition may also bring about, and perhaps even drive, viral evolutionary change. The most famous example of this occurrence is likely the exclusionary relationship between cowpox and smallpox infections. In the late eighteenth century, Edward Jenner demonstrated how humans exposed to relatively avirulent cowpox were resistant to infection with its more deadly relative, smallpox virus (Jenner, reprinted in 1959). Immunological effects such as this are usually the result of similarity in antigenic makeup between the viruses, which causes crossreactivity of specific antiviral defense mechanisms against related types.",

Interviral recombination and reassortment generate diversity in infecting viral populations and thus, in addition to mutation, represent mechanisms that produce the phenotypic raw material upon which selection acts. The evolutionary role of genetic exchange differs from mutation, however, in that exchange allows for more rapid and extreme evolutionary modification. In other words, the sequence space of an organism can be thought of as every possible combination of nucleotides in its genome (e.g., 4v possible genome sequences may exist, where \u03bd is the genome length). Most of these potential genome compositions are not biologically viable and are thus never observed in nature. Likewise, other gene combinations may allow viral replication but only under specific circumstances determined by environmental conditions that may or may not exist at a given time. Still other genetic progeny may exhibit very efficient and successful replication (comparatively), therefore possessing high fitness and existing (symbolically) near the top of a fitness or adaptive peak.",

Therefore, once a genome has \u201csummitted\u201d an adaptive peak, any other small motion would constitute a decrease in fitness \u2014 an improbable occurrence save for the effects of random drift. General movement through adaptive landscapes is discussed more thoroughly and eloquently by Wright (1931, 1932, 1982), Kauffman and Levin (1987), and Coyne et al. (1997). The specific adaptive landscape of viruses is also discussed by Chao (1994), Scott et al. (1994), Eigen and Biebricher (1988), and Domingo and Holland (1997). Niche expansion or shift in the form of changes in host range, tissue type preferences, vector usage, pathogenicity, or combinations of these and myriad other biological traits may represent movement of viral populations between fitness peaks or hills throughout their adaptive space.",

Of greatest evolutionary significance is the generation of recombinants that exhibit phenotypes that differ from both (all) individual viral parents. The ensuing changes may yield expansion of replication capabilities, including changes in cell type preference, interspecies host\u2013host transmission, or even changes in vector utilization. Mixed infections in the laboratory between parent viruses whose replication might otherwise be restricted to infection of only one or another cell type will frequently result in production of viral recombinants capable of replication within both cell types. As an example, using mixed infections of lepidopteran cell lines, Kondo and Maeda (1991) developed recombinants between various NPVs that subsequently exhibited expanded host ranges. The outcome was that coinfection of Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV) with Autographa californica NPV (AcMNPV) resulted in recombinants that could replicate in previously nonpermissive cell types. Another example is provided by the efforts of Spector et al. (1990), who found that experimental coinfection of HIV and a murine amphotropic retrovirus resulted in HIV pseudo-types capable of infecting both CD4\u2013 human cells and mouse cells. These retroviral recombinants thus exhibited expansion in potential host range as well as tissue tropism.",

The evolution of these viruses is reviewed and discussed extensively by Weaver et al. (1994, 1997), Strauss (1993), and Scott et al. (1994). Phylogenetic analysis has revealed how recombination in these viruses has resulted in the acquisition and exchange of genes (and traits) between different viral types, which has given rise to many evolutionarily successful taxonomic groups which persist today. Strauss (1993) has shown how western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is actually a recombinant between eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Sindbis virus. The recombination is manifest biologically not only in the pathogenicity of WEEV, which is similar to that of EEEV, but also in the virus's vector specificity (Culex mosquitoes), which differs from that of EEEV (Culiseta mosquitoes).",

Following a drastic reduction in population size, the probability of fixation of deleterious mutations (which occur with much higher frequency than advantageous ones) is enhanced by the improbability of subsequent reversions (Haigh, 1978; Chao, 1991) and a lack of restorative mechanisms (Muller, 1964). This is termed \u201cMuller's ratchet\u201d since mutations in subsequent (colonizing) populations are accumulated in an irreversible fashion similar to the advance of a ratchet (Muller, 1964). The end-result is a decrease in fitness caused by an increasing mutational load, and this has been observed in numerous viral systems in vitro. Significant fitness decreases following plaque-to-plaque transfers (bottlenecks) have been demonstrated for VSV (Duarte et al., 1992, 1993), RNA phage \u03a66 (Chao, 1990; Chao et al., 1992), FMDV (Escarmis et al., 1996), as well as in the DNA-based cellular microorganism, Salmonella typhimurium (Andersson and Hughes, 1996).",

Although largely ignored as an ecological interaction, genetic exchange in viruses is a process that involves extremely close association (coinfection of a single cell) between individual viruses whose phylogenetic relationship may be somewhat arbitrary. This interaction has the potential to influence the evolutionary path of the existing viruses and even the power to create new viral taxa. The degree and direction of the resulting evolutionary change is intimately dependent on the virus types involved, the conditions of the interaction, both host and virus population characteristics, other coevolutionary interactions, as well as many other probabilistic components.",

The primary basis of this shortcoming is the representational scope of scientific data that exists for viral taxa. As is apparent by our recurrent use of specific virus types in illustration (e.g., HIV), there is a clear overrepresentation of information on viruses that (1) infect humans or economically important biota and (2) are pathogenic. The skewed distribution of data type may be an inaccurate representation of the \u201cviral universe\u201d that exists on our planet. Therefore, while the existent virology literature may be immense and thus allow elucidation of amazing phenomena, our knowledge about chemistry, biology, and evolution will certainly be enhanced by investigation of new and unusual viruses. This limitation also precludes the types of large-scale generalizations about virus biology and evolution that can occasionally be made regarding other organisms.",

This selective environment is partitioned into many compartments, each of which has a role in shaping the overall adaptive landscape. In addition, we hopefully have demonstrated the extreme range of virus adaptability that allows these beings to parasitize genomes in essentially any of their possible manifestations and to subsequently exhibit overwhelming diversity. The mechanisms that are employed in diversification (adaptation, genetic exchange, mutation, niche segregation, cospeciation) contribute fundamentally to the broad range of their variation. We have attempted to illustrate this in Figure 9\n, which demonstrates the evolutionary history of imaginary virus taxa in relation to their hosts.",
