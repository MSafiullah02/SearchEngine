            "text": "There are several reasons why transplant-related infectious diseases are important to the critical care community. First, there are increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of the improved survival rates of recipients of all types of solid organ transplants (SOTs). As the longevity of transplant recipients increases, these patients are more prone to develop chronic conditions that frequently require ICU stays. Second, the development of novel and more potent immunosuppressive agents has the potential to increase the frequency and severity of posttransplant infections that subsequently necessitate admission to a critical care unit. Lastly, infections in transplant candidates and recipients are a major cause of morbidity, mortality, increased length of hospital stay, and increased costs.1\n",

These microorganisms can cause blood flow through the pump to become turbulent; this in turn enables the pathogens to adhere to the surface of the device.4 Patient-related risk factors for infection include older age, poor nutritional status, indwelling catheters, prolonged intubation, postoperative bleeding, blood transfusions, multiorgan dysfunction, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, prolonged hospitalization before VAD implantation, and surgical reexploration.4, 6, 7 Mechanical trauma to the driveline exit site is frequently associated with late-onset (>30 days after implantation) infections. Driveline trauma occurs when, for example, the controller or battery pack is dropped or when the driveline is snared on an object. These accidents result in shearing or torsion injuries that can lead to infection.12\n",

CMV can trigger rejection and the inflammatory effects of rejection and rejection therapy can increase CMV viral replication. The allograft is more likely to be affected by a CMV infection than a native organ. Thus, liver transplant recipients with CMV infections are prone to develop vanishing bile duct syndrome, heart transplants recipients are at risk for coronary artery vasculopathy, lung transplant recipients are at risk for bronchiolitis obliterans, and so forth. The most common types of CMV disease are hepatitis, pneumonitis, and gastroenteritis. With regard to CMV serostatus, the risk of developing a posttransplant CMV infection is highest in CMV-seronegative recipients who receive an allograft from a CMV-seropositive donor and lowest in CMV-seronegative recipients who receive an allograft from a CMV-seronegative donor. Recipients who receive potent antirejection therapy such as antithymocyte globulin are also at increased risk for developing a CMV infection. A concurrent critical illness can lead to the reactivation of a latent CMV infection; this is thought to be associated with proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent downregulation of the immune system. Agents used to prevent or treat CMV infection include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, acyclovir, and CMV immune globulin. Foscarnet is often used to treat ganciclovir-resistant organisms. Because CMV can be transmitted through blood transfusions, CMV-seronegative transplant candidates and recipients should receive CMV-negative, leukocyte-poor, or filtered blood products.1, 24\n",

The risk of disseminated candidiasis is highest in neutropenic patients with central venous catheters who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics and who have had prolonged ICU stays.29 Liver transplant recipients are at highest risk for invasive candidiasis, followed, in decreasing order, by pancreas, lung, heart\u2013lung, kidney, and heart transplant recipients.29\n",

In this setting, the patient often develops a systemic infection that subsequently spreads to the CNS. Viral CNS infections may be associated with the reactivation of a latent virus, such as JC virus-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or they may be caused by a new exposure to a pathogen such as West Nile virus. Other pathogens commonly associated with posttransplant encephalitis include the herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, EBV, and CMV.
