These programs were developed out of a need to counter the threat from our enemies and protect military forces and the homeland from biological attack. On the other hand, biosecurity is a more recent development, made up of policies and measures designed to protect the homeland, food supply, and agricultural resources from natural and accidental outbreaks and bioterrorism attacks. Many of the recent initiatives in biodefense and biosecurity came after the fall of the Soviet Union, as officials from NATO countries worried about the potential for Soviet biological weapons falling into the wrong hands. In the United States, the Clinton administration took a fairly proactive stance toward biological threat reduction. The events of September 11, 2001, and the Amerithrax incident further solidified national resolve against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and acts of terrorism.",

Cited as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, the legislation makes it unlawful for \u201canyone to develop, employ, produce or stockpile any biological material that is intended to cause harm, illness, injury or death.\u201d The purpose of the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 is to implement, within the United States, the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). You may recall from chapter Seeds of Destruction that the BWC is an international agreement, ratified by the US Senate in 1974, and signed by more than 100 other nations, including the Soviet Union. The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 was also detailed to protect the United States against the threat of biological terrorism. Nothing in the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 was intended to restrain or restrict peaceful scientific research or development. Chapter 10 of the act, \u201cBiological Weapons,\u201d is made up of four sections:\u2022prohibitions with respect to biological weapons,\u2022seizure, forfeiture, and destruction,\u2022injunctions, and\u2022definitions.\n",

Indeed, what the previous two administrative documents indicate is that the illicit use of biological agents is not only unlawful, it is an act of terrorism and constitutes the use of a WMD. Each of these has ramifications as to how a person or persons may be investigated, charged, tried, prosecuted, and incarcerated. In addition, these terms have implications for government agencies involved in investigative and response functions. Therefore even the most seemingly small act that involves the unlawful use of a biological agent can bring the entire weight of the federal government down on the head of the offending party.Critical ThinkingConsider a young gang member mashing up a small quantity of castor beans to impress his delinquent friends. Armed with a dozen castor beans and a terrorist cookbook, he generates a crude extract of ricin. He places the extract in a vial and tells his friends that he intends to use it against a rival gang. Two days later, he uses the crude extract in an attempt to poison several gang members. Is this an act of terrorism? Is this the use of a WMD? In accordance with local and state laws, what other infractions might he be charged with?\n",

In those two directives, response and recovery were identified as key components of managing the consequences of a WMD attack. Mitigating illness and preventing death are the principal goals of medical countermeasure efforts. Biological agents offer the greatest opportunity for medical mitigation, and this directive accordingly assigns priorities to countermeasure efforts. The directive recognizes that development and acquisition of effective medical countermeasures to mitigate illness, suffering, and death resulting from chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear, and explosive agents is central to consequence management efforts. Although it is not feasible to develop and stockpile medical countermeasures against every possible biological threat, the directive aimed at tackling some of the more important ones. The directive promotes the development of vaccines and drugs to prevent or mitigate adverse health effects caused by exposure to biological agents. This directive also provides for tailoring ongoing research and acquisition efforts to continue to yield new countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents and for incorporating such new discoveries into domestic and international response and recovery planning efforts.",

As discussed later, there is also federal isolation and quarantine authority. The CDC, through its Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, also is empowered to detain, medically examine, or conditionally release persons suspected of carrying certain communicable diseases. This authority derives from Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 264).Isolation: For People Who Are Ill\nIsolation refers to the separation of persons who have a specific infectious illness from those who are healthy and the restriction of their movement to stop the spread of that illness. Isolation allows for the focused delivery of specialized health care to people who are ill, and it protects healthy people from getting sick. People in isolation may be cared for in their homes, in hospitals, or in designated health-care facilities. Isolation is a standard procedure used in hospitals today for patients with tuberculosis and certain other infectious diseases. In most cases, isolation is voluntary; however, many levels of government (federal, state, and local) have basic authority to compel isolation of sick people to protect the public. Isolation is authorized until the person is no longer contagious.\n",

            "text": "To contain the spread of a contagious illness, public health authorities rely on many strategies. Two of these strategies are isolation and quarantine. Both are common practices in public health, and both aim to control exposure to infected or potentially infected persons. Both may be undertaken voluntarily or compelled by public health authorities. The two strategies differ in that isolation applies to persons who are known to have an illness (see Fig. 10.2\n) and quarantine applies to those who have been exposed to an illness but may or may not become ill (see Fig. 10.3\n). As to who can invoke quarantine and isolation, that varies by state. In general, a governor, state public health officer, city or county council, mayor, or local public health office may do so. In most states, a public health emergency declaration is not legally required, but the declaration could be useful if invoking powers for a large population. The bottom line is that one should check with a qualified attorney before powers need to be invoked.\nQuarantine: For People Who Have Been Exposed But Are Not Ill\nQuarantine refers to the separation and restriction of movement of persons who, although not yet ill, have been exposed to an infectious agent and therefore may become infectious. Quarantine of exposed persons is a public health strategy, similar to isolation, that is intended to stop the spread of infectious disease. Quarantine is medically very effective in protecting the public from disease.\n",

Many state health laws do not spell out the procedural requirements for quarantine and isolation, whereas others have fairly detailed provisions.

These protections may require notice and hearing requirements, showing that detention is necessary to protect public health, and a reviewable final decision. If other measures are workable and protect public health, then they may be constitutionally required. A court might find it unreasonable to arrest and forcibly quarantine people if a lesser restraint would be effective. It may also be important for health officials to estimate how important 100% compliance is with a quarantine order to protecting the public health. Alternatively, would a stay-at-home quarantine be effective if 80% of the population comply?Federal Powers: Quarantine of Travel\u201cA person who has a communicable disease in the communicable period\u2022Shall not travel from one state or possession to another\u2026\u2022Without a permit from the health officer of the state, possession, or locality of destination, if such permit is required under the law applicable to the place of destination.\u201d\n\n",
