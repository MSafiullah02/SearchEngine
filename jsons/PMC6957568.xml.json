            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the etiological agent of the eponymous foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Infected cloven-hoofed animals present the typical signs of vesicular lesions in and around the mouth and on the feet. The disease affects domesticated as well as wild animals [1]. Although mortality caused by the disease is low, FMD is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. Transmission can occur through contact between susceptible animals, by contaminated air, feed, and water and by fomites [2, 3]. The disease is still common on the African continent, the Arabian Peninsula as well as in South and Southeast Asia [4]. Drastic control measures such as culling of all animals in an infected herd and trade embargoes result in great economic losses to livestock production and farming communities [5]. Therefore, FMD is one of the most important obstacles to agricultural development and international trade in animals and animal products [6]. Inactivated vaccines have been used to eradicate FMD from Europe, South America, and other regions and are still an important tool for control programs in endemic areas as well as for the emergency response to outbreaks in formerly free areas [7, 8]. Commonly, these FMD vaccines are produced by propagation of FMDV in BHK-21 cells [7]. It is known for many viruses, however, that cultivation outside the natural host, for instance during the course of adaptation to a permanent cell line, can result in alterations to the amino acid sequence of viral proteins [9\u201313]. Especially RNA viruses, such as FMDV, consist of viral populations without a defined genomic sequence but of distributions of related but non-identical genomes (quasispecies). The error-prone genome replication and the missing proof-reading function of the viral polymerase results in high mutation rates, generating a broad variety of genetic and phenotypic variants within the viral population [14]. The adaptation is commonly achieved by repeated passaging in cell culture until the virus grows to high titers [15]. In the case of FMDV, this often leads to an attenuated clinical phenotype in the natural host [13] and can change important physical properties of the viral capsid such as resistance to acids [16\u201318] and temperature [19]. For vaccine production, the acquisition of mutations that confer an extended receptor tropism is a welcome event that facilitates adaptation of the virus to cell culture. FMDV utilizes cell surface molecules called integrins as a receptor in the natural host and as a primary receptor in cell culture [20\u201325]. Integrins are heterodimers that consist of an alpha (\u03b1) and a beta (\u03b2) subunit. In their function as integral membrane proteins, integrins enable cell signaling through conformational changes that facilitate outside-in and inside-out signaling, bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by recognizing RGD motifs and mediate cell adhesion [26\u201328]. Four different integrin heterodimers (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28) can be utilized as cellular receptors by FMDV [21, 22, 24, 29], whereby the virus binds to the cell via the RGD motif and induces internalization [27]. Cell lines commonly used for FMDV propagation present at least one of these integrins to varying extents [30]. Nevertheless, passaging induces the utilization of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPG) as secondary receptors for the virus [13, 31]. In addition, the Jumonji C-domain containing protein 6 (JMJD6) has been proposed as an additional receptor that enables FMDV to infect cells in an integrin- and HS-independent manner [32]. In any case, adaptation of FMDV to cell culture for vaccine production is laborious, time-intensive, and sometimes not possible at all [33].",

Important structural elements such as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) are located within the 5\u2032 UTR. Downstream of the 5\u2032 UTR is one large open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a single polyprotein [39]. The polyprotein is co- and post-translationally cleaved into four structural proteins that form the viral capsid and eleven non-structural proteins (NSP) by viral and possibly cellular proteases [6, 14, 38, 39]. Genome replication and protein processing are mediated by the NSP. Another UTR forms the 3\u2032 end of the genome and comprises a stem-loop structure of approximately 100 nucleotides followed by a poly-A tract [39].",

The most commonly described amino acid exchanges replace a positively charged lysine with a glutamate (the anion of glutamic acid) with a single negative charge, but its replacement with an uncharged asparagine or a positively charged arginine has also been observed [50, 52, 60\u201362]. Amino acid exchanges at position 210 inhibit the cleavage of the VP1-2A product [60\u201362]. They have been reported for FMDV serotype O, serotype A, and SAT 1 and are always linked to the E83K substitution, also in VP1 [50, 52, 60\u201362]. This replacement of a negatively charged glutamate with a positively charged lysine is the only exchange ever observed at residue 83. Residue 83 is situated within the DE loop at the outer surface of the capsid. Unlike exchanges at residue 210, those at position 83 can also occur in combination with exchanges at positions 108, 110, 142, and/or 194 [33, 50, 63]. They seem to provide a selective advantage for virus propagation in BHK cells.",

            "text": "While unique amino acid substitutions have been described for different FMDV serotypes (see Table 2), there are parts of the protein where amino acid variations accumulate. Several amino acid exchanges are described for residues 78\u201380 and 130\u2013131 for serotypes A and O [15, 50, 51, 54, 58, 63, 70, 71] as well as at position 77 for SAT2 [50]. While the residues 78\u201380 follow the BC loop at position 70\u201376, the residues 130\u2013131 are part of the EF loop (position 130\u2013137) [48]. These amino acids are displayed at the external surface of the viral particle [63, 70], constituting important antigenic sites of the virus [48]. The most frequently reported amino acid exchange is the replacement of the negatively charged anion glutamate at position 131 with a positively charged lysine (E131K). An extended receptor tropism has been described for serotype A and O viruses with amino acid exchanges at positions 78\u201380 and 130\u2013131 [70]. Exchanges in this area seem to modulate the RGD-containing GH loop of VP1 by changing its spatial orientation, allowing the virus to either use HS or an unknown receptor for attachment to host cells [54, 58, 63, 70]. Furthermore, changes in this part of VP2 are often described to occur in combination with substitutions in VP1 [58, 63] during passaging in BHK cells [15, 71].",

This region lies within the \u03b1B helix of VP2 (residues 133\u2013138) and is part of the depression that is used for HS binding [48]. Modifications at positions 170 to 175 have also been reported for serotype A and O viruses as well for SAT serotypes. The Q170H/R substitution in SAT1 and SAT2 viruses increases the positive charge around the threefold axis of the particle [50]. The K172N exchange described for a serotype A virus, on the other hand, reduced the positive charge of the region by substitution of a positively charged lysine with an uncharged asparagine [15, 58]. A third exchange, K175R in the GH loop of VP2, described for serotype O retained the positive charge at this position [57]. Variations in VP2 are often accompanied by amino acid exchanges in either VP1 or VP3. An overview of previously reported amino acid exchanges in VP2 is given in Table 2.",

This pore structure is highly hydrophobic due to the largely conserved amino acids phenylalanine, valine, and cysteine at positions 3, 5, and 7 of VP3, respectively [41] (Fig. 9).",

A cluster of substitutions near the N-terminus of VP3 was reported again for type C (N13H, M14L, A25V) and SAT viruses (T43S, Q49E) [50, 53, 59, 66] in connection with an extended receptor tropism after serial passaging of the virus in BHK cells. One of the most variable areas of the protein lies between residues 55 and 88 [42], which are part of the HS binding site of the virion [48]. Several publications describe substitutions toward a positive charge on position 56 for serotype A [51, 52] and O [13, 72, 74], structurally the \u03b2B \u201cknob\u201d of VP3 that forms one of the walls of the HS binding depression [48]. Close to that position, at residue 59, the exchange of negatively charged glutamate with a positively charged lysine has been reported for serotype Asia-1 during the adaptation of the isolate to grow in BHK suspension cells [33]. This residue is located at the loop downstream of the B1 strand, and is a part of the HS binding site on the virus particle [48]. Residues 84\u201388 shape the bottom of the indentation [48] but amino acid exchanges in this region do not always result in the expected acquisition of positively charged residues (H85Q [52], H85R, M86V, M86T [15]).",

Substitutions toward a positive charge at the surface-exposed loops of the \u03b2E\u2013\u03b2F part of the protein (T129K, E135K) seem to be advantageous for SAT serotypes to adapt to cell culture [50]. Other amino acid exchanges within this variable region were described for a serotype A strain adapting to BHK suspension cells (E138G, K139E) [15] and when adapting a SAT virus to adherent BHK cells (D132N) [50]. Another \u201cadaptive hot-spot\u201d lies between positions 173 and 180, where a multitude of substitutions has been reported in the course of cell culture adaptation of virus isolates of various serotypes (A, O, C, and SAT1) [15, 50, 51, 53, 57, 62, 66]. Amino acid exchanges at the C-terminus of the protein are also quite common among Eurasian and SAT serotypes but there are no detailed descriptions of the effect of these mutations [15, 50, 53, 56, 66]. Because the C-terminus is located at the outer surface of the virus particle, exchanges that support adaptation to culture conditions are likely to occur in this area. A summary of previously reported amino acid substitutions in VP3 is shown in Table 3.",

With 85 residues overall, FMDV has the longest VP4 protein among the picornaviruses, but the 3D structure of residues 1\u201315 and 40\u201364 is still unresolved [40, 41]. Unusual for picornaviruses, the amino acid chain of VP4 forms a helix of three turns, with the myristoylated N-terminus close to the fivefold axis and the C-terminus close to the threefold axis of the particle [40, 41] (Fig. 11).",

Virus strains that do not seem to be able to grow in a particular cell line as well as cell lines that appear to be resistant to certain strains are commonly described problems. This is of particular concern for the development of vaccines to newly emerging virus lineages. Long lead times from virus isolate to vaccine can delay the implementation of effective control programs, and high antigen yields in production cells are essential for affordable vaccines. A rational approach to cell culture adaptation that combines prior knowledge of common adaptive mutations and reverse genetics techniques is urgently required. The ability to engineer recombinant viruses with enhanced growth properties in cell culture can be of great benefit to both the producers and users of FMD vaccines.",

While changes in VP1 can occur and presumably be effective in isolation, adaptive mutations in VP2 were usually seen in combination with amino acid exchanges in VP1 or VP3. The reason for this is unclear, but a possible explanation may lie in the spatial arrangement of the proteins. VP1 has the largest number of surface-exposed residues, while VP2 and VP3 have a larger share of residues involved in forming the virus particle itself, and unbalanced amino acid exchanges in these regions might therefore compromise the integrity of the particle. Many residues in VP1, on the other hand, are free to change without restraint and are more likely to have an immediate effect on virus\u2013cell interactions due to their prominence on the surface on the virion. More research into these patterns is required to identify minimum sets of mutations that maximize virus replication in culture while at the same time preserving the antigenic profile and the stability of the viral particles.",
