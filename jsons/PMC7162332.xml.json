            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is increasingly recognised as the major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. This virus is annually responsible for 20 million infections with 3.4 million symptomatic cases and 70,000 deaths mainly occurring in less developed regions of the world (Debing, Moradpour, Neyts, & Gouttenoire, 2016). Although infection by HEV is usually self\u2010resolving, severe forms or chronic infections have been described, mainly in immunocompromised patients. A high rate of mortality has also been reported among pregnant women. In addition, HEV infection has been associated with a broad range of extrahepatic manifestations, including renal injury and a variety of neurological disorders (Kamar, Marion, Abravanel, Izopet, & Dalton, 2016). Four genotypes (gt) are pathogenic in humans. gt1 and gt2 exclusively infect humans, whereas gt3 and gt4 are zoonotic and mainly infect mammals with occasional transmission to humans (Doceul, Bagdassarian, Demange, & Pavio, 2016). In industrialised countries, the most common genotype causing HEV infection is gt3. Importantly, due to the evolution toward chronicity in immunocompromised infected patients, HEV transmission through blood transfusion, resistance of some infected patients to ribavirin and complications in patients with preexisting liver disease, HEV infection is now considered as an emerging problem in industrialised countries (Sayed, Vercouter, Abdelwahab, Vercauteren, & Meuleman, 2015).",

            "text": "HEV has been classified as the sole member of the Orthohepevirus genus within the Hepeviridae family (Smith et al., 2014). It is a quasi\u2010enveloped virus containing a linear, single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA genome that encodes three open reading frames (ORFs), namely, ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 (Tam et al., 1991). ORF1 is the largest gene that encodes a non\u2010structural polyprotein (ORF1 protein) that contains several functional domains essential for viral replication (Koonin et al., 1992). These functional domains include the methyltransferase (Met), papain\u2010like cysteine protease, RNA helicase (Hel), and RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (reviewed in Debing et al., 2016). To date, there is no clear evidence of ORF1 protein processing by protease and antibodies that robustly recognise ORF1 protein are not available. ORF2 encodes the ORF2 viral capsid protein, which is involved in particle assembly, binding to host cells and eliciting neutralising antibodies. Very recently, we demonstrated that during its lifecycle, HEV produces three forms of the ORF2 capsid protein: ORF2i (infectious/intracellular ORF2), ORF2g (glycosylated ORF2), and ORF2c (cleaved ORF2). The ORF2i protein is associated with infectious particles, whereas ORF2g and ORF2c proteins are massively produced glycoproteins that are not associated with infectious particles and are the major antigens present in HEV\u2010infected patient sera (Montpellier et al., 2017). ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional phosphoprotein that is involved in virion morphogenesis and egress (reviewed in Holla, Ahmad, Ahmad, & Jameel, 2013).",

            "text": "Due to difficulties in efficiently propagating HEV in cell culture, numerous pathways and processes of the HEV lifecycle remain to be elucidated. Notably, mechanisms leading to HEV replication are particularly poorly understood. However, it has been shown that the ORF1 protein might be membrane\u2010associated and localised in the endoplasmic reticulum\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), suggesting that HEV replication might occur within the early secretory pathway (Perttil\u00e4, Spuul, & Ahola, 2013). Plus\u2010strand RNA virus replication occurs in close association with host cell membranes. In infected cells, cellular and viral factors cooperatively generate particular structures resembling organelles that are named viral replication factories. This compartmentalisation allows for coordination of the different steps of the replication cycle, highly efficient RNA replication, and protects the viral genome from cell defence mechanisms. It has to be noted that for a number of viruses, the viral budding site is located near the replication factories, indicating a spatial coordination of replication and viral assembly steps. To induce these massive membrane rearrangements, viruses use cellular factors active on membranes and exploit the cellular pathways involved in membrane homeostasis (reviewed in Paul, 2013). In particular, some viruses divert components from the cellular secretory pathway. Indeed, it has been shown in our laboratory that the guanine nucleotide\u2010exchange factor Golgi brefeldin A (BFA) resistance Factor 1 (GBF1) is necessary for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (Farhat et al., 2016; Goueslain et al., 2010). GBF1 has also been identified as a cellular factor essential for the replication of a number of other viruses such as picornaviruses and coronaviruses (Belov, Feng, Nikovics, Jackson, & Ehrenfeld, 2008; Lanke et al., 2009; van der Linden, van der Schaar, Lanke, Neyts, & van Kuppeveld, 2010; Verheije et al., 2008).",

            "text": "To investigate HEV replication mechanisms, we used BFA, a fungal metabolite inhibiting the activation of Arf proteins, small G\u2010proteins regulating the cellular secretory pathway. The inactive, cytoplasmic GDP\u2010bound form of Arf proteins, upon nucleotide exchange to GTP, undergoes conformational changes that allow Arf\u2010GTP proteins to bind membranes. The active GTP\u2010bound form of Arf proteins is essential for the formation of secretory vesicles, actin remodelling and phospholipid metabolism by recruiting to membranes effectors that mediate these processes. BFA blocks Arf activation by inhibiting a subset of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that regulate the conversion of Arf\u2010GDP into Arf\u2010GTP. In human cells, BFA inhibits the function of three of the 15 known Arf GEFs: GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2, by stabilising normally transient complexes formed between the GEF and Arf\u2010GDP. Here, we demonstrate that BFA inhibits HEV replication and identified GBF1 as the BFA\u2010sensitive GEF required for HEV replication.",

            "text": "In order to investigate the role of the cellular membranes during HEV infection, we used BFA that blocks several membrane trafficking pathways and causes major membrane rearrangements in the host cell (Klausner, Donaldson, & Lippincott\u2010Schwartz, 1992). The Gaussia luciferase (Gluc)\u2010encoding subgenomic replicon construct derived from the HEV gt3 Kernow\u2010C1 p6 strain was modified to produce the subgenomic replicon p6SPGLuc. In this replicon, the first 20 amino acids matching with the signal peptide of Gaussia luciferase were deleted to block secretion of the luciferase. In this context, the amount of intracellular GLuc is proportional to viral RNA synthesis and consequently to HEV replication. In addition, this system allows replication to be monitored independently of protein secretion that is blocked by BFA. Huh\u20107.5 cells were electroporated with in vitro\u2010transcribed p6SPGLuc RNA and luciferase activities were measured at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hr post\u2010electroporation (p.e.). For each time point, values are presented as fold increase compared to luciferase activities measured at 6 hr p.e. As shown in Figure 1a, the level of p6SPGLuc steadily increased over time to reach a fold increase of 490 times at 72 hr p.e., indicating that the p6SPGLuc replicon efficiently replicates in Huh\u20107.5 cells and can be used as a tool to study the HEV replication step. HEV\u2010p6SPGLuc\u2010electroporated Huh\u20107.5 cells were then treated for 16 hr with different concentrations of BFA (Figure 1b). In parallel, transfected cells were treated with sofosbuvir, an inhibitor of HCV polymerase, which has been recently described as a HEV replication inhibitor (Dao Thi et al., 2016; Figure 1c). Luciferase activities were measured at 24, 48, and 72 hr p.e. For each BFA concentration, values are presented as a percentage of replication compared to non\u2010treated cells (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]). As expected, treatment of p6SPGLuc\u2010electroporated Huh\u20107.5 cells with sofosbuvir led to a dose\u2010dependent decrease of HEV replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10.6 \u03bcM. Interestingly, treatment of electroporated Huh\u20107.5 cells with BFA also led to a dose\u2010dependent decrease of HEV replication with an IC50 of 0.02 \u03bcg/ml (Figure 1b), indicating that BFA is an inhibitor of gt3 HEV replication. Next, to verify that the decrease of HEV replication was not due to a toxic effect of the BFA treatment, we performed a 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20105\u2010 (3\u2010carboxymethoxyphenyl)\u20102\u2010(4\u2010sulfophenyl)\u20102H\u2013tetrazolium viability assay on Huh7.5 cells treated for 16 hr with BFA. As shown in Figure 1d, although a weak toxicity was observed at 1 \u03bcg/ml, the concentration of 0.1 \u03bcg/ml for which HEV replication was reduced by 1 log had no significant toxic effect, indicating that the inhibitory effect of BFA on HEV replication was not due to cell toxicity. In order to confirm the inhibitory effect of BFA on HEV replication in another cell line, we next analysed BFA activity on HEV replication in PLC3 cells, a PLC\u2010PRF\u20105 derived cell clone that highly replicates HEV genome (Montpellier et al., 2017) (Figure 1a, PLC3/p6SPGLuc). As shown in Figure 1e, BFA efficiently inhibited p6SPGLuc replication in transfected PLC3 cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of BFA on HEV replication is not cell line dependent. We also analysed the antiviral activity of BFA in Huh\u20107.5 cells transfected with the gt1 Sar55 Firefly luciferase (FLuc)\u2010encoding subgenomic replicon (Sar55FLuc) (Figure 1a and 1f). As for gt3, BFA at 0.1 and 1 \u03bcg/ml strongly inhibited gt1 replication, indicating that the BFA inhibitory effect on HEV replication is not genotype dependent. Lastly, we performed experiments with the full\u2010length infectious p6 clone (Shukla et al., 2012). Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with the full\u2010length p6 strain RNA, and then, BFA was added for 16 hr. At 96 hr post\u2010transfection, cells were fixed and analysed by immunofluorescence with an anti\u2010ORF2 capsid protein antibody. As shown in Figure 1g, treatment with BFA at 0.1 and 1 \u03bcg/ml led to significant decrease of ORF2\u2010positive cells, indicating that BFA inhibits the HEV lifecycle.",

Among the 15 members of the Arf GEF family in human cells, only three are inhibited by BFA: BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1 (D'Souza\u2010Schorey & Chavrier, 2006; Gillingham & Munro, 2007). To check which of the three BFA\u2010sensitive GEFs are required for HEV replication, we analysed the effect of their depletion on HEV replication (Figure 2). However, GBF1 silencing was toxic in our experimental conditions due to the slow kinetics of HEV replication, which requires long depletion times. As an alternative, we used Golgicide A (GCA) that specifically inhibits GBF1 with no effect on BIG1 and BIG2 (S\u00e1enz et al., 2009). Huh7.5 cells were transfected with siRNA pools targeting BIG1, BIG2, BIG1 and BIG2 or a non\u2010targeting siRNA pool (Figure 2a). Two days post\u2010transfection, depleted cells were electroporated with the p6SPGLuc replicon, and luciferase activities were measured at 24, 48, and 72 hr p.e., as described previously. As shown in Figure 2b, depletion of BIG1, BIG2 or BIG1 and BIG2 together did not result in any significant decrease of HEV replication levels. In contrast, when p6SPGLuc\u2010electroporated Huh\u20107.5 cells were treated with GCA, which specifically targets GBF1, HEV replication levels were strongly inhibited (Figure 2c) without any significant toxicity (Figure 2d). Altogether, our results suggest that GBF1 is likely the BFA\u2010 and GCA\u2010sensitive factor required for HEV replication.",

The R2 cell line is resistant to 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of BFA and able to support HCV replication in the presence of 100 times more of BFA than the parental Huh\u20107 cell line. This resistance is due to a point mutation (M832L) in the sec7 catalytic domain of GBF1, which is known to impair the binding of BFA (Farhat et al., 2013). In order to confirm that BFA inhibition of HEV replication was only related to the effect of the drug on GBF1, we transfected the p6SPGLuc replicon in R2 and parental Huh\u20107 cells (Figure 3). BFA was added for 16 hr as in the previous experiments. HEV replication was strongly inhibited by BFA in parental Huh\u20107 cells (Figure 3a). In contrast, the replication of p6SPGluc was almost insensitive to BFA in R2 cells regardless of the concentration of BFA (Figure 3b).",

Indeed, it has been shown that GBF1 overexpression or expression of the M832L BFA\u2010resistant GBF1 mutant can rescue HCV replication from BFA inhibition whereas expression of the E794K catalytically inactive GBF1 mutant cannot (Farhat et al., 2016; Goueslain et al., 2010; Jackson & Casanova, 2000; Niu, Pfeifer, Lippincott\u2010Schwartz, & Jackson, 2005). We therefore transfected Huh\u20107.5 cells with plasmids expressing YFP\u2010fused wildtype GBF1 (GBF1wt), M832L BFA\u2010resistant GBF1 mutant (GBF1ML) or E794K inactive GBF1 mutant (GBF1EK). A plasmid expressing only the YFP protein was used as a control (YFP). Two days post\u2010transfection, expression levels of YFP\u2010fused GBF1 proteins and YFP protein were controlled by western blotting (Figure 4a) and fluorescent microscopy (Figure 4b), and transfected with the full\u2010length infectious p6 RNA (Figure 4c). Cells were next treated for 16 hr with 75 ng/ml BFA, a concentration that inhibits approximately 60% of the HEV replication. It has to be noted that BFA treatment had no impact on the subcellular localisation of GBF1 proteins (Figure 4b). Four days p.e., cells were fixed and analysed by immunofluorescence with an anti\u2010ORF2 capsid protein antibody, as described in Figure 1. For each transfection, control DMSO values were set to 100%, and the corresponding percentage was calculated for the BFA treatment condition. As shown in Figure 4c, upon treatment with BFA, the number of ORF2\u2010positive cells was reduced by approximately 50% in cells transfected with YFP and GBF1EK mutant. In contrast, overexpression of GBF1wt led to an increase of 20% in the number of ORF2\u2010positive cells, and the expression of the BFA\u2010resistant mutant M832L restored more than 35% of HEV replication, as compared to DMSO treated cells, indicating a protective effect of functional GBF1 overexpression over BFA\u2010induced inhibition of HEV replication.",

In order to investigate how GBF1 is involved in HEV replication, we next performed time\u2010course experiments in which BFA was added for 16 hr at various time points (0, 24, and 48 hr) after electroporation, and replication levels were measured at 24, 48 and 72 hr p.e.

Due to the lack of tools to probe ORF1 protein in HEV\u2010replicating cells (Lenggenhager et al., 2017), co\u2010localisation studies of GBF1 with the HEV replicase could not be performed. Therefore, non\u2010transfected PLC3 cells and cells transfected with the full\u2010length infectious p6 clone were co\u2010stained with antibodies directed against GBF1 and the ORF2 capsid protein. As expected, in non\u2010transfected PLC3 cells, GBF1 staining was observed in Golgi\u2010like perinuclear structures and in cytoplasmic small dot\u2010like structures (Figure 6, PLC3). Similar intracellular GBF1 distributions were observed in HEV\u2010replicating cells (Figure 6, PLC3/HEV\u2010p6), indicating that the major subcellular localisation of GBF1 is not modified upon HEV replication and therefore is likely not recruited and stably maintained on HEV replication complexes. The same results were obtained in transfected Huh\u20107.5 cells (data not shown). As an alternative approach to determining whether GBF1 is recruited to the replication sites, we analysed the subcellular localisation of GBF1 in cells overexpressing the non\u2010structural ORF1 polyprotein in combination or not with the structural ORF2 and ORF3 proteins (Figure 7). The ORF1 protein was detected with three different antibodies directed against either the Met, Hel, or Pol domain. We observe no difference in the localisation of GBF1 upon expression of the viral proteins. In addition, GBF1 and ORF1 did not co\u2010stain regardless of the antibody used, strengthening our hypothesis that GBF1 is probably not recruited to HEV replication sites.",

GBF1 also participates in Golgi morphogenesis and lipid droplet metabolism (Jackson & Bouvet, 2014). In addition, GBF1 is hijacked by several positive\u2010strand RNA viruses including Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae members for their replication (Belov et al., 2008; Carpp et al., 2014; Goueslain et al., 2010; Lanke et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2014; van der Linden et al., 2010; Verheije et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014). For instance, GBF1 was shown to interact with poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) non\u2010structural protein 3A (Wessels et al., 2006; Wessels et al., 2007). GBF1 overexpression rescues enterovirus replication in cells treated with BFA, whereas its silencing strongly inhibits viral replication (Belov et al., 2008; Lanke et al., 2009). The precise role of GBF1 in enterovirus replication is not clear. It has been proposed that Arf\u2010activating function of GBF1 would be necessary for enterovirus replication to recruit other cellular factors supporting replication such as the phosphatidylinositol kinase PI4KIII (Hsu et al., 2010). However, more recent data suggest that enterovirus replication requires the N\u2010terminal region of the GBF1 protein but not its Arf\u2010GEF activity (Belov, Kovtunovych, Jackson, & Ehrenfeld, 2010; Viktorova, Nchoutmboube, Ford\u2010Siltz, & Belov, 2015). In contrast, GBF1\u2010mediated Arf1 activation is crucial for mouse hepatitis coronavirus RNA replication (Verheije et al., 2008). GBF1 is also a host factor required for HCV replication (Goueslain et al., 2010). In contrast to enteroviruses, no interaction between GBF1 and viral proteins has been reported so far. In addition, it has been shown recently that the role of GBF1 in HCV replication is mediated by its Arf\u2010GEF activity (Farhat et al., 2016). Interestingly, Arf4 and Arf5 were shown to be essential for mediating GBF1 function in HCV replication, yet depletion of these two Arf proteins did not inhibit the secretory pathway, instead affecting lipid metabolism (Farhat et al., 2016). In our study, we demonstrate that GBF1 has essential functions in HEV replication. Further experiments using Arf protein expression knockdown, and mutants of the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1 (Farhat et al., 2016), are now necessary to define the importance of Arf\u2010GEF activity of GBF1 in HEV replication.",

This compartmentalisation allows coordination of the different steps of the replication cycle, resulting in highly efficient RNA replication as well as protection of the viral genome from cell defense mechanisms. These remodelled membranes are characterised by two different types of membrane structures: the invaginated vesicle or spherule type induced for instance by Dengue virus and the double membrane vesicle induced for instance by poliovirus and HCV (reviewed in Paul, 2013). To induce and maintain such membrane rearrangements, viruses usurp cellular factors that are active on membranes. For instance, enteroviruses recruit Arf GEFs to rearrange Golgi and ERGIC membranes (Belov et al., 2006) and ER\u2010resident reticulon proteins (Tang et al., 2007), whereas alphaviruses subvert amphiphysins localised at the plasma membrane for membrane remodelling and viral RNA replication (Neuvonen et al., 2011). As mentioned previously, GBF1 is essential for the replication of enteroviruses, coronaviruses, and flaviviruses, all of which are viruses inducing remodelling of intracellular membranes. In the present study, we demonstrated that GBF1 is a cellular factor required for the activity of HEV replication complexes. Based on the fact that viruses using GBF1 for their replication induce membrane rearrangements, we can therefore speculate that HEV replication might depend on such membrane reshuffling. Further studies using electron microscopy of cells highly replicating the HEV genome are thus required to test this hypothesis.",

However, although the full\u2010length protein or domains of the non\u2010structural ORF1 protein can be detected by antibodies in cells transfected with vector systems (Lenggenhager et al., 2017; Perttil\u00e4 et al., 2013), these antibodies fail to detect ORF1 protein in HEV\u2010replicating cells (data not shown; Lenggenhager et al., 2017). This lack of tools directed against ORF1 prevents us from analysing whether GBF1 is recruited to replication complexes in HEV\u2010replicating cells. As an indirect approach, we first analysed the subcellular distribution of GBF1 in HEV replicating and non\u2010replicating cells and found no evidence of a change in its intracellular localisation. As a second alternative approach, we studied the subcellular distribution of GBF1 in cells overexpressing the ORF1 viral replicase and found that GBF1 intracellular pattern was unaffected by viral protein expression. In addition, we did not find any evidence of GBF1\u2010ORF1 co\u2010localisation. These results suggest that, as for its involvement in HCV replication, GBF1 might have an indirect role in HEV replication by activating effectors involved in HEV replication.
