While individuals may be protected from infection or disease by vaccine-induced immune responses, decreasing the number of susceptible hosts in a population also helps break the chain of transmission that pathogens require to spread and persist in human populations by induction of \u2018herd immunity.\u2019 The benefits of herd immunity depend on achieving sufficiently high immunization rates in a population to impact pathogen transmission dynamics (including the potential for extinction of ongoing interhost transmission). The requisite level of vaccination coverage of a population needed to compromise pathogen spread significantly varies between pathogens, and is influenced both by vaccine efficacy (and its duration) and by the reproductive characteristics and infectiousness of the pathogen.",

In many instances, the disease burden from several vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood has been reduced by over 99% since vaccine introduction (e.g., diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio). The somewhat lower rate of decline of pertussis (the annual morbidity of which has been reduced by a nonetheless impressive 83%) relates to the limited duration of vaccine-induced immunity, which is estimated to wane within 5\u201310 years after childhood vaccination. It is anticipated that recent availability of pertussis booster vaccines for use in adolescents and adults will lead to significant further declines in pertussis morbidity. Even for diseases targeted by vaccines that have been in widespread use for less time (< 10 years), impressive decreases in disease morbidity have been seen (e.g., varicella, hepatitis A, and pneumococcal disease). In a notable recent demonstration of the population benefits of vaccines, introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine resulted in a decrease of 73% in disease morbidity in children under 5 years of age within the first 5 years of its introduction. Interestingly, the rate of meningitis and bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae also fell by 81% in this age group. In a striking related finding illustrating how vaccines can impact pathogen transmission dynamics, rates of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections also declined by 49% in individuals over the age of 65 who had not received the vaccine. Thus, direct protection by vaccination of children who represent a reservoir of infection provided, via herd immunity, significant indirect benefits to those who did not themselves receive the vaccine.",

Evaluation in the USA of the impact of ten vaccines routinely given as part of the childhood immunization schedule (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), polio; measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and varicella) found that more than 14 million cases of disease and more than 33 500 deaths were averted over the lifetime of the immunized birth cohort of children.7 When the cost of the vaccination program was compared to the economic impact of diseases prevented, these vaccines alone are estimated to save nearly $10 billion each year. When including indirect economic benefits (such as the time parents take off from work to care for sick children), the annual savings to society exceed $40 billion. When 30 preventive services were ranked based on clinically preventable disease burden and cost-effectiveness, childhood immunization received the highest score.8\n",

Thus, the number of diseases that can be prevented by vaccines included in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) routine childhood and adolescent immunization schedules grew from seven in 1985 to 16 in 2007 (Table 92.3\nand Fig. 92.1\n). Moreover, in the past several years, new vaccines have been introduced for adolescents and young adults (e.g., pertussis booster (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines), and older adults (e.g., Tdap and zoster vaccines) have shown that the value of vaccines extends across the human lifespan (Figs 92.1 and 92.2\n). New combination vaccines have been developed to increase the simplicity and acceptability of vaccination regimens, as well as to improve overall compliance with the recommended series of vaccines. Such combinations include either those that contain multiple inactivated or recombinant antigens (such as a combination diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib, and hepatitis B vaccine) or multiple live attenuated viruses (such as a combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV)). The development of a combination vaccine is often more complicated than simply combining individual antigens, for when antigens are administered in combination, immunologic interference is sometimes seen. This necessitates titration of antigen combinations (and in the case of combinations of inactivated and/or recombinant antigens, adjuvant selection) to achieve immune responses that are not inferior to each of the antigens administered individually.",

The efficacy of many live attenuated vaccines likely reflects the ability of the attenuated vaccine to replicate within vaccinated hosts, and to expose the immune system to pathogen-derived antigens in a manner that closely resembles the nature, location, and effects of natural infection. Because live attenuated vaccines replicate within immunized individuals, they can induce both cellular (CD4 and CD8) and humoral (B-cell) effector responses and immunologic memory.

As such, an effective but also safe and well-tolerated vaccine needs to strike a specific balance between level of attenuation and level of immunogenicity. In addition, depending on the nature and number of genetic mutations responsible for the attenuated phenotype, a potential risk of reversion to a pathogenic form exists for certain vaccines. For most live attenuated vaccines, this has not been observed to be a problem in clinical practice \u2013 likely because the attenuating mutations are sufficiently numerous or genetically stable. One vaccine where reversion to pathogenic form was seen involved specific components of the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV; the \u2018Sabin vaccine\u2019). In this instance, vaccine reversion to wild-type was shown to lead rarely to cases of paralytic polio (approximately one case per million doses administered).14 Based on these observations and the elimination of endogenous polio transmission in many developed countries, the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV; the \u2018Salk vaccine\u2019) was substituted for OPV. However, in light of a favorable cost\u2013benefit ratio, high degree of efficacy, and ease of administration, OPV continues to be the mainstay of polio vaccination efforts in developing countries.",

In most cases, treatment with chemical agents such as \u03b2-propiolactone and formaldehyde is used to eliminate pathogen infectivity. While this approach has the benefit of presenting most of a pathogen's antigenic repertoire to the immune system of the immunized host, it can only be used in instances where the inactivated pathogen does not possess constituents that would confer significant toxicity. Vaccines based on killed pathogens are believed to exert their protective effects via elicitation of pathogen-neutralizing antibodies and the induction of memory B-cell responses (likely in concert with CD4 T-cell memory). However, because inactivated pathogens cannot accomplish de novo synthesis of pathogen-derived gene products in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they do not typically induce CD8 T-cell responses (Chapter 6). In addition, killed vaccines are generally less immunogenic than live attenuated vaccines. As a result, they are commonly administered with an adjuvant (most often alum: see section on Adjuvants, below) to augment their immunogenicity. A number of viral and bacterial vaccines currently in use are killed/inactivated vaccines, including whole-cell Bordetella pertussis vaccine and the influenza virus, rabies virus, and hepatitis A virus vaccines.",

Although such purified polysaccharides can induce protective levels of antibody responses in adults, they are poorly immunogenic in children under 2 years of age (as a function of the relative immaturity of their immune systems). In addition, T-Independent antibody responses elicited by purified capsular polysaccharides are less durable than those that are produced in the presence of CD4 T-cell help. As a means of both augmenting antibody responses against polysaccharide antigens in young children and facilitating their persistence, the development of conjugate vaccines represented an important advance.18 In this approach, purified polysaccharides are chemically conjugated to a carrier protein (such as diphtheria toxoid or an outer-membrane protein complex (OMPC) derived from N. meningitidis). The carrier protein augments CD4 T-cell helper responses to the polysaccharide antigens, and enables elicitation of durable protective antibody responses even in young children. Polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines have been produced that protect against Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis infections.",

            "text": "As a necessary prelude to clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines in humans, extensive preclinical research and development activities are undertaken to establish that the vaccine candidate has the desired properties. Toward this end, a number of key issues need to be addressed. First, animal studies must show that the vaccine candidate raises the desired type and magnitude of immune response against the infectious agent. Second, the vaccine needs to protect animals against death or disease in an appropriate challenge model, when feasible. Ideally, in the course of these studies, a specific type or level of immune response, referred to as a correlate of immune protection, can be identified. Third, the vaccine should be relatively free of serious discernible toxicities and side effects in animals when administered by the route intended for humans. Fourth, it is necessary to demonstrate that the vaccine can be produced in a consistent manner by a process that is consistent with the current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) process by which the first clinical trial materials will be produced (www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/indcgmp.pdf).\nKey Concepts: Considerations Guiding Vaccine DevelopmentThe development of new vaccines depends on the convergence of public health need, biological plausibility, and practical feasibility. Vaccine development programs are influenced by multiple considerations, including:>>What are the major unmet medical and public health needs today?>>What is known about the natural history and pathogenic mechanisms of the infection of interest?>>Is immunity to a given antigen associated with protection against disease following re-exposure in the context of natural infection?>>If natural immunity capable of preventing re-infection follows an initial infection with the pathogen, can a specific host immune effector mechanism (e.g., antibody, CD8 T-cell) be identified as the likely agent (or \u2018correlate\u2019) of immune protection? If so, can a threshold level of this specific immune correlate needed for protection from re-infection be defined?>>Can the pathogen be grown in culture? If so, does the pathogen cause such a life-threatening disease that an attenuated version of the virus would face an impossible barrier for demonstration of safety?>>Can a specific antigen (or antigens) be identified that represents the target of protective host immune responses?>>If the protective immune response is mediated by antibodies, can the target antigen (be it a protein or polysaccharide) be produced in scalable quantities in a form that mimics its native structure so that it can effectively elicit antibody responses that can block the key functional role(s) of the target molecule in the pathogen lifecycle or otherwise lead to the clearance of an incipient pathogen infection?>>Having chosen an antigen and presentation system, what is the best way to produce it on a large scale? Choices will be limited by the nature of the antigen and delivery system, but definition of an optimal system for producing the vaccine (prokaryotes like Escherichia coli, or diverse eukaryotic hosts including yeast, insect cells, plants, or cultured plant cells, mammalian cells) is a central consideration.>>What is the most effective way to present the antigens of the pathogen of interest to the immune system? Modern molecular biology and biochemistry have provided numerous options for vaccine immunogen presentation, including recombinant proteins (and recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs)), synthetic proteins, protein\u2013polysaccharide conjugates, and gene delivery systems (recombinant viral vectors, or DNA vaccines)>>Is the antigen of interest sufficiently immunogenic on its own, or is augmentation of the desired immune response by conjugation to a specific carrier or addition of an adjuvant necessary to elicit a sufficient and sufficiently durable immune response in individuals in the target population for vaccination?>>What types of potential safety concerns can be anticipated for the vaccine in question?>>What is the attack rate of the infection in the general population? If the infection occurs relatively rarely in an overall population, can a subset of the population be identified that has a higher risk of infection so as to accelerate the achievement of statistically significant protection? Is this subset sufficiently similar to the rest of the population to enable extrapolation of the clinical results to the broader target population as a whole?>>What tests to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity will need to carried out on clinical samples obtained from participants in the clinical trials? Will measurement of antibody titers, T-cell responses, pathogen presence and quantity, pathogen serotype, and any other parameter peculiar to the disease in question represent the primary criteria for vaccine effect? Development and validation of theses tests represent an essential component for the feasibility and success of a vaccine clinical study\n\n",

However, to demonstrate that these alternative rotavirus vaccines were safe, and that an increased risk of intussusception was not inherent to rotavirus vaccines as a class, very large-scale safety studies were required. Toward this end, the safety of each of these vaccines was evaluated in studies involving about 70 000 infants \u2013 just to evaluate whether the rate of intussusception in vaccinees was discernibly increased compared to the normal background rates seen in the placebo recipients.10., 11. Fortunately, both vaccines were found to be well tolerated and no increase in intussusception was observed in vaccine as compared to placebo recipients. In light of the documented efficacy of these vaccines determined in earlier and significantly smaller phase III trials, both have now been licensed in a number of countries. However, even with the large phase III studies conducted for these newer rotavirus vaccines, they will still be studied in large postlicensure active surveillance safety studies and closely monitored in active and passive vaccine safety surveillance systems (see below).",

In some instances, specific vaccines have been associated with increased incidence of a specific adverse experience, such as the association between the first-generation rotavirus vaccine and an increased risk of intussusception following vaccination. However, a number of other safety concerns that have emerged are not supported by scientific evidence. An example of this can be found in the case of concerns about the association of whole-cell pertussis vaccines with permanent brain damage \u2013 concerns that were later shown to be unfounded. Nevertheless, public concerns about the safety of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine resulted in decreased levels of pertussis vaccination coverage that were soon followed by epidemics of whooping cough in the UK and Japan.30 Another example is the allegation that certain vaccines, such as the combination measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, are associated with autism. Highlighting how perceptions of temporal association can give rise to public concerns, MMR vaccines are generally given around 1 year of age, and autism is generally diagnosed in the second year of life. Although the alleged causal association between MMR and autism has been refuted by thorough scientific analyses, reports in the popular media in the UK resulted in a dramatic drop in vaccination rates, followed by an increased rate of new infections.31., 32.\n",

As the most promising biomedical intervention to contain the AIDS pandemic, the development of an HIV vaccine is a top global health priority. Yet, HIV infection represents a vexing challenge to vaccine development.35., 36. HIV infection does not result in clearance of the virus due to a host immune response. Following infection of target cells, the genome of HIV \u2013 a retrovirus \u2013 is transcribed into a DNA copy via the action of reverse transcriptase. The newly formed DNA copy of the HIV genome then integrates into the host cell chromosomes (referred to as a provirus) as a requisite step in the viral lifecycle. Once integrated into the chromosome of an infected cell, the HIV provirus can alternatively be actively transcribed, leading to the synthesis of viral mRNAs and subsequently to production of new virus particles, or it can remain in a transcriptionally silent, functionally latent state in a small percentage of infected cells. As infected cells harboring latent HIV proviruses do not produce HIV protein antigens, they cannot be recognized by host antiviral immune responses and can thereby persist undetected. Upon subsequent activation of latently infected cells at some later time, viral RNA transcription can be coincidently activated leading to production of progeny virions.",

As a result of these influences, genetically diverse populations of HIV variants are established in infected persons that facilitate the outgrowth of genetic variants that can escape from selective pressures \u2013 be they effective host cellular or humoral immune responses, or the inhibitory effects of antiretroviral drugs.37 An extraordinary degree of genetic diversity is also manifest in the HIV variants seen in different individuals and in different geographic regions.

It has been hypothesized that induction of high levels of HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses prior to infection may not prevent infection, but may enable infected individuals to control virus replication better. Should this hypothesis be valid, individuals immunized with such vaccines may exhibit lower levels of ongoing HIV replication, progress to AIDS more slowly, and potentially be less likely to transmit HIV infection to others. Much of this work involves vectored gene delivery systems (such as adenoviral vectors, described below). However, the recently announced results of a phase IIb \u2018test of concept study\u2019 39 failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on either prevention of infection or reduction of viral load among volunteers who received the vaccine despite the induction of appreciable levels of HIV-specific CTL responses by the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine employed. While this study result does not, in and of itself, refute the \u2018CTL hypothesis\u2019, it represents a significant disappointment for the AIDS vaccine research effort, and raises important questions about the ability of vaccine-elicited cell mediated immune responses to favorably alter the outcome of HIV infection.39a There are also efforts under way to utilize the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the HIV Env glycoprotein to guide the derivation of non-native structures that might serve as better immunogens to elicit broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies.

In addition to direct morbidity and mortality, malaria is responsible for debilitating illness with enormous social and economic consequences. Of the four malaria-associated protozoal species, Plasmodium flaciparum and P. vivax represent the two major agents. These parasites have a three-stage lifecycle taking place both within the mosquito, and in the liver and blood of the infected host, and each cycle is largely distinct from the others from an immunological perspective. As a result of the multiple strategies for evasion of host immune response that the parasite has evolved, parasite replication proceeds at high levels despite active host immune responses.42., 43. Either as a result of these specific immune evasion strategies or the inability of the infected human host to mount immune responses that clear the parasite, prior infection does not protect an individual from repeated subsequent infections. Although the severity of disease is often attenuated following repeated infection, the mechanism of disease modulation is incompletely understood, and the limited relative immunity engendered by prior infection is easily lost if an individual leaves a malaria-endemic region. As such, the limited impact and duration of host immune responses to malaria parasites suggest that any successful vaccine strategy will need to do far better than natural immune responses \u2013 a high bar for efforts to develop an effective vaccine.",

Furthermore, the interface of HIV infection and its attendant immune system damage both increases the severity of M. tuberculosis infection and increases the infectiousness of infected individuals. The emergence and dissemination of M. tuberculosis isolates that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs represent a growing public health threat. However, while the need for a vaccine to prevent tuberculosis is clear, a significant number of challenges face vaccine development efforts.48 Most individuals infected with M. tuberculosis can control the acute phase of mycobacterial replication, and mount vigorous innate and adaptive immune responses to the infection. However, the infection is often not cleared by the host's immune response, and the mycobacteria are able to persist and multiply within vacuoles inside macrophages. Long-term latency is established in fibrotic cysts in the lung. The recrudescence and dissemination of M. tuberculosis occur at a later time in a number of infected individuals, likely as a result of waning host immune control. Although the ability of M. tuberculosis to persist despite active innate and adaptive immune responses represents a major challenge to vaccine development, the fact that most individuals can contain (if not clear) M. tuberculosis infection suggests that a vaccine that can alter the course of the natural infection by limiting early dissemination and decreasing the risk of later recrudescence could provide major public health benefits.",

Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (better known as BCG), based on Mycobacterium bovis, was first introduced in 1921.49 Currently, BCG is provided as a component of the routine Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) schedule and is administered to a significant majority of the world's children. Although some protective efficacy (50\u201380%) has been reported against miliary infection and M. tuberculosis meningitis in children, conflicting results have been obtained in different studies regarding the ability of BCG to protect against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. One explanation for the overall limited efficacy of BCG emerges from formal genome sequencing studies that have disclosed significant differences between M. tuberculosis and of the vaccine strain of BCG. The variability in the results of BCG efficacy studies in different populations and geographies may derive from variations in the geographic prevalence of cross-reactive mycobacterial species (that may themselves confer partial protection), or the fact that BCG vaccines used throughout the world do not represent a homogenous preparation \u2013 with the root strain of BCG having been widely distributed and passaged extensively under diverse conditions.",

The determination of the sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome nearly a decade ago helped identify numerous previously unknown gene products, and increased the repertoire of antigens to be evaluated for their ability to induce protective immune responses.52 The pathogen sequence is also being used to elucidate virulence determinants and thereby help guide efforts to attenuate M. tuberculosis rationally.",

A variety of influenza vaccines are licensed for pediatric use, but vaccines to prevent infection with the paromyxoviruses RSV and PIV remain elusive. A significant impediment to vaccine development for RSV and PIV traces back to unanticipated untoward results obtained in clinical studies of inactivated RSV vaccines in the early 1960s.53 These early-generation RSV vaccines \u2013 based on cultured virus that had been inactivated with formalin \u2013 raised a potent antibody response in immunized children. However, on subsequent natural exposure to RSV, vaccine recipients exhibited more frequent and significantly more severe lower respiratory tract RSV infections than did unimmunized children. As a similar phenomenon was also seen with a formalin-inactivated measles vaccine in the same era, a common immunopathologic mechanism may be operative.54 While the mechanism of exacerbation of RSV disease by the early inactivated vaccines is incompletely understood, it has been suggested that chemical inactivation of RSV and measles resulted in modification of a critical neutralizing structure on the surfaces of these viruses, thereby limiting the induction of the most potent neutralizing antibodies and favoring nonneutralizing and potentially immunopathologic antibody responses. (Passive protection against RSV is available for premature infants in the form of monoclonal antibodies that target the RSV F protein (one of the viral envelope glycoproteins); certain anti-RSV antibody responses can clearly mediate protective as opposed to deleterious effects.46) Alternatively, or in addition, it has been proposed that inactivated RSV vaccines may have preferentially induced a Th2-type immune response when a Th1-type response may be needed to effect protection of the lower respiratory tract from RSV infection and damage.",

Like other herpes viruses, HSV infections are not cleared by the immune system and the virus can persist, remaining in a latent state that is functionally inaccessible to immune recognition and clearance. In addition, like other herpes viruses, HSV encodes a number of gene products that promote evasion of host immune responses. Recent attempts to make HSV2 vaccines have used virus glycoproteins produced by recombinant DNA methods. A recent clinical efficacy trial of this vaccine approach showed partial protection of women, but not men, who were seronegative for HSV1.61 The reasons for this curious result are not clear, but efforts to develop this type of vaccine continue. In addition, a number of preclinical studies are exploring the ability of cell-mediated immune responses to HSV antigens induced by recombinant vaccine vectors (e.g., adenoviruses: see Novel vaccine vectors, below) to prevent or ameliorate HSV infections. Genetically engineered attenuated HSV variants have also been studied in experimental animal models.

As a result of these advances, vaccine development is now commonly pursued in a hypothesis-driven manner and is a far less empiric pursuit than in the past. However, at the same time, the infectious diseases for which no effective vaccines currently exist represent more challenging targets than those diseases that have yielded to vaccine development efforts in the past. Furthermore, global changes that influence the emergence and rate of spread of infectious diseases place unprecedented challenges on the productivity and pace of new vaccine development efforts.Current opportunities\n>>Improved understanding of human immunology (including the biology of innate immune system function, antigen presentation, and the generation and maintenance of T- and B-cell memory)>>Improved technologies to measure human cellular and humoral immune responses>>The advent of genomic and proteomic technologies for new antigen discovery>>The wealth of recombinant DNA methodologies that enable the isolation and characterization of protective antigens from diverse pathogens (including those that may not be successfully propagated in culture)>>The development of recombinant and synthetic approaches for the large-scale production of precisely defined vaccine antigens (including the ability to produce immunogens that accurately recapitulate the conformational structure of native antigens, or that, alternatively, alter them so that they serve as more effective immunogens in eliciting desired immune responses)>>The emergence of new mechanism-based vaccine adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens\nCurrent challenges\n>>The need to develop vaccines for infections where natural immunity does not often or ever develop following natural infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, hepatitis C)>>The need to develop vaccines that protect against genetically diverse pathogen variants with a limited number of vaccine immunogens (e.g., HIV, malaria, and influenza)>>The need to develop vaccines for infections where concerns exist about vaccine elicitation of potentially autoimmune (Neisseria meningiditis group B) or immunopathologic (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus) responses by vaccination>>The challenge of responding rapidly and effectively, with powerful new technologies, to newly emerging infections \u2013 including those that haven't been seen in humans before (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs)) or for which novel antigenic variants are anticipated but cannot be predicted (e.g., pandemic influenza)>>Maximizing the value of innovative new approaches while ensuring the safety of new vaccines so derived\n\n",

Following initial infection, CMV persists in infected humans, despite the fact that anti-CMV antibodies are present and that a very sizeable proportion of the overall host CD4 and CD8 immune responses are specific for CMV antigens. Ongoing virus persistence and replication in the face of active host immune responses are likely explained by CMV's sophisticated repertoire of host immune evasion functions (including those that inhibit antigen presentation mechanisms and immune effector responses).

Importantly, early human clinical trials of TLR-predicated adjuvants have supported the promise of this approach to mechanism-based strategies to augment vaccine immunogenicity. An important challenge is to define the most potent and best-tolerated variants, and to define rules by which activation of specific TLR pathways might translate into predictable augmentation of desired types of immune responses. It is hoped that general rules will emerge to suggest which of an increasing number of novel adjuvants in development performs best with which type of vaccine immunogen, and if results obtained with a specific type of immunogen\u2013adjuvant combination can be extrapolated to predict the likelihood of enhanced immunogenicity with other vaccines. Although beyond the reach of available experimental results, the ability to tailor, titrate, and otherwise optimize immune responses to vaccines by manipulation of specific TLR pathways appears a realistic future possibility. However, important challenges remain. In particular, a primary challenge for next-generation adjuvant development is finding a combination that retains immunopotentiating action while minimizing vaccine-associated adverse experiences. Short-term adverse experiences, such as local injection site reactions, represent undesirable side effects that may disqualify candidate adjuvants early in clinical development. However, given that vaccines are administered to healthy people to prevent potential future infectious diseases, the potential for rarer adverse experiences (such as autoimmunity) that may only be manifest with much longer latency from the time of vaccine adjuvant administration will undoubtedly be important considerations for use in prophylactic vaccines.",

Although the DNA vector is most commonly injected intramuscularly, the generation of specific immune responses depends on the uptake of the vector DNA by APCs followed by the expression, processing, and presentation of vector-encoded antigens. As tissue and tissue fluids present a hostile environment for purified DNA, and the process of DNA uptake by APCs appears to be relatively inefficient, much of the dose of injected DNA is degraded before it can be reached by an APC that can initiate the desired immune response.",

Murine studies have shown that administration of antigen-encoding plasmid DNA can elicit appreciable cellular and humoral immune responses that may confer protection against experimental challenge. However, translation of these promising results in animal models to humans has proven frustrating. While DNA vaccines have been generally well tolerated in immunized volunteers, in most human studies of DNA vaccines, administration of even substantial quantities of DNA vaccine vectors has elicited relatively low-level immune responses. It is not yet known whether these disappointing results reflects fundamental differences in the immunogenic behavior of DNA vaccines in humans and mice, or the fact that the DNA doses administered to humans do not match those administered to mice (DNA per weight of the immunized host). Given the substantial size differences between humans and mice, it would likely be impractical (for reasons of both vaccine supply and the actual process of administration of sufficiently high doses of DNA) to administer the relative murine dose to humans.

These viruses do not normally circulate in humans, so immunity to these viruses is quite rare in humans. Alphaviruses have a strategy for overexpressing the proteins that make up the virion by making a separate subgenomic RNA specifically encoding these gene products. Current recombinant alphavirus vaccine vector strategies take advantage of this subgenomic transcript, replacing the viral genes with selected genes for other antigens, but maintaining the signals for translation and protein production. In addition, through use of genetic complementation, it is possible to generate virus particles that only contain this heterologous antigen-encoding expression cassette. Such virus particles can efficiently mediate infection of host cells, but because they lack other alphavirus genes needed for virus replication cannot spread beyond the initial target cell infected.114., 115. Alphavirus vectors rival the adenoviruses in efficiency of protein production in tissue culture and have induced robust antibody and T-cell responses in preclinical studies.116 One current limitation of the alphavirus vector system is the difficulty of scaling the production system; however, this is a technical matter that should be addressable. In addition, ample safety data will be needed before widespread use of alphavirus vaccines achieves endorsement by regulatory authorities for use in healthy populations.",

AAV is transmitted in conjunction with adenovirus infection, and is not known to cause any significant disease. It is poorly immunogenic in the course of natural infections.117 AAV can integrate into the genome of the infected cell, usually in a particular place on chromosome 19, although integration\nKey Concepts: Vaccine Approaches being Explored to Improve on Natural ImmunityFor many important infectious diseases for which no vaccines are currently available, successful derivation of effective vaccines will depend on improving upon natural immunity, especially in those instances where natural immunity does not follow natural infection (such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria) or where safety concerns limit the development of specific protective antigens (Neisseria meningitidis group B). In addition, for other pathogens that typically manifest significant genetic (and antigenic) diversity (such as influenza, HIV, and bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), a need exists to develop novel vaccines that can protect against a wide range of variants with a limited number of vaccine immunogens. Towards these ends, a number of new approaches, enabled by new vaccine technologies, are being pursued, including:>>Targeted alteration of protective antigens to increase their ability to elicit protective immune responses (e.g., efforts to alter the structure of the HIV Env glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 so that they elicit higher-level, more potent, neutralizing antibody responses than their native counterparts)>>The development of synthetic consensus antigens able to elicit broader immune responses than would sequences obtained from individual pathogen isolates (e.g., efforts to develop consensus immunogens able to elicit cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses against genetically diverse HIV-1 variants)>>Techniques for new antigen discovery to identify novel conserved antigens within otherwise genetically diverse pathogens (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) or those for which currently known protective antigens cannot be developed as vaccines (e.g., Neisseria meningitidis group B)>>The use of novel adjuvants or vaccine vectors to enable generation of higher-level and/or more functional immune responses to pathogen antigens by vaccination than are seen following natural infection, and to enable high-level, fully functional memory immune responses to be activated at the time of initial infection (e.g., efforts to elicit high-level HIV-specific or hepatitis C virus-specific CTLs by recombinant viral vectors)>>Use of novel methods to shift relative immunodominance of specific pathogen gene products to increase the immunogenicity of conserved antigens from otherwise diverse pathogen genomes that are typically poorly immunogenic in the course of natural infections (e.g., efforts to augment the antibody response to the influenza A virus M2 protein via the use of potent adjuvants or conjugation to immunogenic carrier proteins)\ndoes not appear to be efficient or site-specific when replication-defective adenoviruses of the type being developed as vaccine vectors are used. The propensity for chromosomal integration and poor immune response to the virus made AAV a good candidate for gene therapy; cells with an integrated viral genome could deliver a gene product for a long time without the immune system killing the infected cell. Recently, efforts have been made to adapt replication-defective AAV as a vaccine vector. Although encouraging results have been reported in preclinical studies, phase I studies in humans have demonstrated disappointing immunogenicity.",

The term \u2018reverse genetics\u2019 refers to the use of recombinant DNA methods to generate infectious viruses possessing genomes derived from cloned cDNAs. Such cDNAs can be modified to study the impact of specific genetic modifications to viral phenotype, providing a new approach for the generation of live attenuated vaccines via either introduction of targeted mutations or, in the case of segmented viruses, the preparation of vaccines via genetic reassortment (see Fig. 92.4). Reverse genetic methods provide promising tools for the study and defined manipulation of both nonsegmented and segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses, respectively). The use of reverse genetic strategies to generate infectious viral progeny from cloned cDNAs is shown above. Influenza virus genomes are comprised of eight single-stranded (negative-sense) RNA segments. Initiation of influenza virus RNA (vRNA) transcription from negative-sense genomic RNAs, and the replication of the virus genome, depends on the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (which includes viral RNA, the nucleoprotein (NP) and three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA)). To generate infectious influenza virus from cDNAs of the vRNA genome segments, cells are cotransfected with all eight segments of vRNA under the control of RNA polymerase promoters. Cellular polymerase I (pol 1) synthesizes vRNAs that are then replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase and NP proteins that comprise the RNP complex. Reverse genetics strategies are expected to facilitate the generation of novel flu vaccines by enabling preparation of well-defined vaccine preparations comprised of donor \u2018backbone\u2019 viral segments (see Fig. 92.4) that harbor specific attenuating mutations with vRNA segments encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins obtained via reverse transcription of vRNA genes from circulating viruses (including those prepared from pandemic strains that may be difficult and/or unsafe to propagate in large manufacturing scale).",

Viruses with segmented genomes provide a new approach for the generation of attenuated vaccines via Mendelian genetic reassortment. If two such segmented viruses with different genetic characteristics are used to infect one cell, the progeny viruses from this mixed infection will carry a range of mixtures of the genes of the two parent viruses. Using either genetic or immunologic screening methods, reassorted viruses carrying the precise gene composition of interest can be selected. This approach has recently been employed to generate live attenuated vaccines against rotavirus and influenza virus. The strategy for generation of the pentavalent bovine\u2013human reassortment rotavirus vaccine is shown above. Rotaviruses have a segmented double-stranded RNA genome comprising 11 independent RNA elements. The outer shell of the virus comprises two proteins VP4 and VP7 that are involved in cell binding and entry and that specify the viral serotype (P type for VP4 and G type for VP7). VP4 and VP7 also represent the targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The pentavalent bovine\u2013human rotavirus vaccine was generated by a \u2018modified Jennerian\u2019 approach in which the bovine rotavirus WC3 (which is attenuated in humans as a result of host range restriction) serves as the gene donor for the backbone on to which gene segments encoding four common human rotavirus G types (G1\u20134) as well as one very common P type (P8) (derived from individual rotavirus isolates) were reassorted via a process of cell co-infection and subsequent selection of the recombinant viruses with the desired composition of bovine and human gene segments. An analogous genetic reassortment approach has also been used to generate live attenuated influenza vaccines. In this instance, three attenuated \u2018cold-adapted\u2019 viral strains (two A types and one type B) are used in co-infections in tissue culture with recent circulating wild-type influenza strains to derive vaccine strains that include the two relevant hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)-encoding gene segments admixed with the six \u2018backbone\u2019 genes from the attenuated master donor virus for use in annual influenza vaccines.",

In addition, recombinant VLPs have been employed to derive safe and effective vaccines for pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), that cannot be grown in culture (and are thus refractory to standard vaccine approaches of attenuation or inactivation). The generation of the VLPs that comprises newly developed HPV vaccines is shown. The HPV L1 proteins (which represent the major capsid protein and target of virus-neutralizing, protective antibodies), derived from HPV types of interest (e.g., types 16, 18, 6, and 11) are produced via recombinant methods. Under appropriate conditions, individual bioengineered L1 proteins first self-assemble into pentamers, and then into VLPs that are comprised of 72 pentamers and that are almost identical, both morphologically and antigenically, to infectious HPV virus particles.

Specific TLRs and their natural activating ligands are shown above. Different TLRs are associated with different adaptor proteins that propagate intracellular signaling along distinct pathways which favor specific immune responses (e.g., Th1, Th2, cross-presentation or CTL priming).
