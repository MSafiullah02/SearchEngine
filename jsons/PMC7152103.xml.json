International regulations were rewritten in 1903 by the Eleventh Sanitary Conference, at which the convention of 184 articles was signed.13 Modern planning, identification, and response to individual pathogenic agents of concern comes out of this historical separation. Additionally with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the twenty-first century, traditional measures were once again utilized because a global public health crisis arose as a result of international travel of people and goods.14\n",

Recognition not only protects each individual and other first responders, but also enables first responders to initiate the system-wide responses necessary to manage these incidents. Most training also emphasizes the adherence to established protocols designed to detect hazardous agents on a minute level by the first arriving units. One aspect of these protocols establishes the criteria for involving the highly advanced capabilities of specialized HazMat and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) teams and state and federal resources, if necessary. Recognition that an incident is beyond the management capability of local resources and involves HazMat or WMD would be an initial reason for an incident commander to reach out through an EOC for state or federal resources. This is particularly true when combined with patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of exposure to HazMat or WMD. State resources that may be called upon include agencies such as CSTs. Federal assistance may be requested by the incident commander in coordination with an EOC at the local and state levels through the proper channels. State and federal authorities throughout a state\u2019s Office of Emergency Management and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) monitor incidents of significance and of larger magnitudes.

Providing a safe shelter for these travel refugees is not only ethical, but also important to help manage the travel quarantine. If screening methods are effective at ruling out exposure or infection, these individuals can be safely moved back to their home regions. It is also important for neighboring areas to establish their own quarantine and screening practices to help evaluate and manage people leaving from a contaminated area. As mentioned previously, traveler quarantine and isolation has been a recurrent theme throughout human history and is an effective means to prevent introduction of pathogens to a new area. Management of private vehicle movements can certainly be a daunting task, but if an infection or environmental exposure is allowed to enter a new geographic region, the ultimate containment process will become exponentially more difficult. As with all forms of quarantine or isolation, clear explanations and equitable treatment of all impacted by the restrictive measures will help to alleviate any growing public distrust.",

Business closures and mandatory sick days can be difficult to enforce, especially in open-market settings with many small business owners operating independently. As evidenced by China\u2019s actions to ban the sale or transport of civet cats during the SARS pandemic, direct interventions on commerce can help to alleviate further exposure spread during a quarantine.33\n",

Initial decontamination and rescue efforts will appropriately focus on humans, but the surrounding livestock exposed to hazardous or contagious materials can also spread disease and radioactive material if their products are not removed from circulation. Guidance from public health officials will be critical in the management of agricultural resources, and importing in sufficient supplies during a quarantine is a critical action for effective societal support. Plants and other crops may exhibit long-term, though silent, contamination and ultimately require destruction. Restricting the movement of livestock in and out of a quarantined area should follow that of humans, with special attention in situations where asymptomatic animals may pass disease to their human counterparts.",

            "text": "\n\u2022\nBalancing civil liberty with quarantine: Any quarantine or isolation will fundamentally restrict certain civil liberties. In the health care setting, specific policies regarding patient isolation are at the discretion of the treating facility, but in the public sphere, isolation measures become ethically challenging. As previously emphasized, the principle of utilizing the least restrictive means possible to accomplish public protection must be at the forefront of any quarantine planning. This strategy will ideally optimize voluntary compliance, which in turn will yield an overall higher protection rate than an overly aggressive quarantine with very poor public compliance. As with any public health crisis, every effort should be made to maintain personal privacy, especially regarding infectious status, whenever possible. Throughout history, quarantines and restriction of societal rights have been utilized in ethical atrocities, and this must be guarded against with well-defined checks and balances to prevent any unintended consequences of a public health effort.\u2022Restricting personal movement and travel capabilities can quickly lead to civil unrest and social stigma. It is important to differentiate and remove any growing blame on infected individuals and redirect focus toward treatment and prevention of further spread. A study of the 2003 SARS outbreak quarantine in Toronto demonstrated that those entering an enforced quarantine were especially concerned with their ability to maintain work wages, obtain groceries, and continue their prior way of life after the quarantine was lifted. All of these concerns are certainly legitimate and are exacerbated by the intentional interruption of daily routine and removal of routine civil rights. Regardless, during times of significant natural disaster, nuclear fallout, or biological terrorism, civil rights may need to be temporarily restricted to help protect the interests of society as a greater whole. The challenge for public officials will be to ensure that this is done in an equitable and reasonable fashion, with allowances and appropriate support for those placed within a quarantine zone, and removal of restricted measures as quickly as the situation permits.\u2022\nObtaining compliance: Whenever rights or activities are restricted by a governing body, a significant amount of civil unrest can result. This can be especially problematic following a major disaster when societal fears and media frenzy have reached maximum levels. Utilizing quarantine as a means of greater public defense and disaster response must always take the forefront of any restrictive efforts with careful attention to ensure that it is not being utilized as a punishment or political tool against a specific population. Clear public communication forums to reinforce that the goal of any isolation or restriction is to prevent the spread of disease and minimize the overall impact of a natural or terrorist-driven exposure.\u2022Unified and consistent statements and stances regarding the best methods for preventing new cases, treating those already exposed, and minimizing civil disruption are critical for the front-line physicians and public health officials. Issues of compensation for lost wages, care for family members, and similar concerns of persons subject to quarantine cannot be ignored. As evidenced by the North American influenza pandemics of 2008 and 2009, education and communication with the public are key components to encourage voluntary cooperation. Public health officials must ensure that restrictive measures are appropriate and proportional for the targeted exposure, implemented uniformly across all socioecomonic statuses, and followed with highly transparent official communications to maintain public engagement.1 Just as careful planning is required to set up an appropriate and effective quarantine, health policy makers must be equally prudent as they deescalate any restrictive measures. Emphasis on resumption of normal routine and the importance of continued monitoring throughout all levels of the health care system can assist in this transition and help to reduce the chances of post-event turmoil.\u2022\nAttention fatigue: Constant vigilance is necessary to maintain quarantine, isolation, and infection control measures following a mass-exposure event. Initial disbelief, even if scientifically justified, can lead to a low index of clinical suspicion. This is especially true in the early phase of a major disaster when the exact details and etiology behind a patient\u2019s symptoms may be unclear. In the modern era of sophisticated biological weapons and the potential for multiple-modality terrorist events, clinicians cannot allow tunnel vision to prevent them from noticing and differentiating pathology. It is also worth noting that even during a mass-exposure disaster, there will still be more typical medical problems requiring emergency intervention. As a result, front-line physicians and other health care providers must maintain attention to clinical details and prevent diagnostic momentum from building based on recent local events. That being said, erring on the side of caution is likely prudent given an unexplained clinical picture with undifferentiated terrorist or natural exposures and with an accepted number of false positives receiving treatment or isolation for precautionary measures.\u2022\nConflicting goals: Physicians and other medical professionals are already accustomed to placing the needs of their patients first. This becomes especially difficult when a specific diagnosis mandates additional isolative measures. After any anxiety-provoking disaster, there will be a significant number of patients seeking reassurance following the development of suspected symptoms. Making decisions that will require treatment can be compounded by additional ethical dilemmas given a patient\u2019s entire socioeconomic sphere, in particular if removing a breadwinner from standard duties. It becomes difficult for the front-line physician to protect an entire population from further exposures while also advocating for their individual patients. Preexisting relationships with patients and community members can also exacerbate a clinician\u2019s ethical dilemma, especially when a particular diagnosis holds isolating repercussions.\u2022This conflict between medical responsibility to individuals and entire populations creates many of the pitfalls surrounding a mass-exposure event. It is especially difficult to maintain professional relationships with patients when trust is questioned following instigation of restrictive measures. Clinicians must communicate clearly and provide effective education to their patients, especially regarding prophylaxis and treatment options. In the initial phase of a mass-exposure event, the front-line provider will be faced with difficult decisions, only further compounded by often conflicted goals of individual and community protection.\u2022\nCommunication: Communication between health care professionals (including first responders) and law enforcement, between the health care professionals and the community, and between governmental authorities and the public require honesty, clarity of message, and frequent updating. Trust, consistency, and credibility are essential. Professional public information officers (PIOs) should manage all communication strategies.\n",
