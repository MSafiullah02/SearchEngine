The nine reference genes under investigation displayed a Ct value range from 16 to 31, which groups them among genes with high RNA transcription (Fig. 1). The average Ct value of each reference gene is given in Table II. The highest expression level with the lowest Ct value of 16 cycles was displayed by PPIA, while the lowest expression level with the highest Ct value of 31 was exhibited by RPII.

Below this threshold it is not necessary to include additional reference genes in relative gene expression calculations. Calculation of pairwise variation V showed that the inclusion of two reference genes is sufficient for data normalization of RV (moi 1 and 10)\u2010infected Vero and RV (moi 2)\u2010infected MCF\u20107 cells as the threshold in each case was below 0.15 (Fig. 2).

Genes with a lower stability value are usually associated with high expression stability. For comparison, corresponding data by geNorm and NormFinder are both included in Figure 3. For RV\u2010infected Vero (moi 1 and 10) cells geNorm and NormFinder give out the same top four reference genes, but differ in their order (Fig. 3A). geNorm has identified HUEL, GAPDH, and HPRT1 as the three most stable reference genes. However, geNorm (HUEL, TBP, \u03b2\u2010actin) and NormFinder (ECHS, HUEL, PPIA) differ on the three most stable reference genes for RV\u2010infected MCF\u20107 cells (moi 2) (Fig. 3B). However, HUEL was either the best or one of the two best ranked genes by geNorm, NormFinder, and \u0394\u0394Ct calculation. Therefore, the expression pattern of the remaining eight reference genes was normalized against HUEL and calculated for mock\u2010infected and RV\u2010infected MCF\u20107 cells for dpi 1 and 3 (expression at dpi 1 for mock\u2010infected cultures was set as 100%). Figure 3C indicates that ECHS as suggested by NormFinder is less well suited for normalization of RV\u2010infected MCF\u20107 cells as TBP, which was suggested by geNorm. TBP shows a lower degree of variation in its expression than ECHS (Fig. 3C). Additionally, geNorm is the most widely used software for identification of suitable normalization factors [Vandesompele et al., 2009 and includes differences in PCR efficiencies in its calculations and selects the two most stable reference genes.

First, GAPDH gave a distinct signal in RT \u2212ve reactions. Although the Ct value of the GAPDH RT \u2212ve was much higher than the Ct value of the positive sample, it was lower than the Ct value of the RT \u2212ve of the remaining reference genes (Table II). This is probably caused by amplification of a retropseudogene due to contaminating genomic DNA. Performing a primer sequence search by BLAT, the BLAST\u2010like alignment tool [Kent, 2002, several retropseudogenes for GAPDH were detectable, one with binding sites for sense and antisense primer possibly yielding a PCR product of 67 bp in length.

Other studies have also shown that ranking differences between geNorm and NormFinder can occur [Skovgaard et al., 2007. However, the least variation of reference gene expression in mock\u2010 and RV\u2010infected cell lines over time of incubation was associated with the first\u2010choice reference genes suggested by geNorm (Fig. 3C). This is supported by calculating the expression values of two representative genes (p53 and SP100) for mock\u2010 and RV\u2010infected MCF\u20107 cells through normalization against HUEL, TBP, and ECHS. The resulting data revealed, that normalization against either HUEL or TBP, or the combination of both resulted in almost identical expression values, while ECHS or ECHS together with HUEL revealed large differences (3\u2010 to 14\u2010fold) in calculated gene expression (data not shown).

The expression of the SP100 gene is inducible by interferon alpha and beta, but also by interferon gamma [Gr\u00f6tzinger et al., 1996. This explains why the induction of SP100 is higher in RV\u2010infected MCF\u20107 and ECV304 than in Vero cells, which lack a type I interferon inducibility [Diaz et al., 1988. We were also able to confirm Northern blot data for the increased transcription level of p21 in RV\u2010infected Vero cells [Mo et al., 2007. However, a discrepancy in the expression level of p53 and RB was detected. Mo et al. have reported a constant transcription level for p53 and RB in RV\u2010infected Vero cells whereas our data reveals a 0.3\u2010fold decrease in p53 and a 1.3\u2010fold increase in the RB mRNA level at 3 dpi. RT\u2010qPCR is more sensitive than Northern blot data and allows for precise quantification. Hence it could be possible that the slight, but significant change in p53 and RB transcription could be missed by Northern blot analysis. The 2.5\u2010fold increase in the p53 mRNA level in RV\u2010infected MCF\u20107 is probably due to induction of a type I interferon response, which has been shown to upregulate p53 transcription [Takaoka et al., 2003.",

We hypothesize in accordance with the data presented by Ilkow et al. that the PABP protein level in Vero cells is increased rather by a post\u2010translational mechanism.
