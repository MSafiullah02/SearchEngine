To study the humoral responses against SARS-CoV, we evaluated nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins-specific antibodies in patients' sera by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Recombinant N and S proteins of SARS-CoV were purified from transformed E. coli. Serum specimens from 40 SARS-CoV-infected patients in the convalescent phase were analyzed by Western blotting using the purified antigens. Serial serum specimens from 12 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS patients were assayed by ELISA using the recombinant N protein as coated antigen. By Western blotting, 97.5% of the SARS patients were positive for N proteinspecific antibodies whereas only 47.5% of the samples were positive for S protein-specific antibodies. Using N protein-based ELISA, 10 out of the 12 patients were positive for N proteinspecific antibodies and 6 of them showed seroconversion at mean of 16 days after onset of fever. Immunoblotting was useful for detecting the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV infection. Antibodies against SARS-CoV N protein appear at the early stage of infection, therefore, N protein-based ELISA could serve as a simple, sensitive, and specific test for diagnosing SARS-CoV infection.",

It is also a major viral antigen stimulating host's immune responses. Previous studies on animal coronaviruses have shown that some antigenic peptides of the N protein can be presented on the surface of infected cells and recognized by T cells [Boots et al., 1991; Wege et al., 1993] . Immunization with DNA vaccine of the N protein of TGEV could elicit both antibody production and T cell response against the N protein in mice [Liu et al., 2001] . It has also been reported that the N protein-specific cellular immune response is essential for protection against FIPV infection [Gerber et al., 1990] .

Cells were either lysed by sonication or microfluidizer depending on the volume of culture. After centrifugation, the lysate was separated into supernatant and pellet fractions. The solubility of recombinant proteins was then determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of these two fractions. To purify the recombinant protein, the lysate was incubated with TNE-equilibrated glutathione resin at 48C for 1 hr. In consequence, the resins were packed and washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 at a flow rate about 1 ml/min. The bound protein was eluted by 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) buffer. The purified recombinant N and S proteins were used for antibody generation and also used as the antigens for Western blotting and ELISA.",

The absorbance at 450 nm of the control sera increased when more coated antigen was used. Therefore, we used 1 mg/ml antigen for coating plates. The mean A 450 of normal control sera in this Nprotein ELISA was quite low (0.06-0.07) at each dilution of sera (n \u00bc 5) (Fig. 4A ). The number of normal control sera has been expanded to 192 and the mean A 450 (AEstandard deviation, SD) at a 1:20 dilution was 0.0456 (AE0.054). The mean AE4 SD (0.262) was set as the cutoff value and the false positive rate of the negative sera was 1.04% when using this cutoff value. ELISA performed on serially diluted positive sera produced typical ELISA curve and had an end point (A 450 below 0.262) between 1:640 and 1:1280 dilutions (Fig. 4A ). However, an obvious variation of titers of N proteinspecific antibodies in different patients' sera was noted as reflected by the huge error bars.

These data were similar to those obtained from SARS-CoV-based ELISA or IFA Peiris et al., 2003a] . Until now, there are still no satisfactory diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), SARS-CoV-based ELISA, and IFA are three commonly used methods for detecting either viral RNA or virus specific antibodies . RT-PCR technique is a relatively sensitive assay comparing with the others and it could detect as low as 10 copies of SARS-CoV viral transcripts per reaction, corresponding to 830 RNA molecules per milliliter of specimen . However, the false positive rate may be higher than the other methods because of the cross-contamination in laboratories. A serological examination will provide another independent evidence of infection. Both SARS-CoVbased ELISA and IFA need the preparation of viruses as a source of antigen, which may reduce their accessibility for the general laboratories without biosafty containment facilities. The N protein-based ELISA can be performed in laboratories without containment facilities, due to the use of a single immunogenic viral protein instead of highly infectious SARS-CoV as coated antigen. In contrast to the IFA, which is not suitable for large-scale surveys, an ELISA based on a recombinant protein as coated antigen is easier to be produced and performed.",

It has been found in pigs upon TGEV infection that in order to achieve a protective immune response equivalent to that induced by full S protein, the intact globular N-terminal half of the protein was essential [Tuboly et al., 1995] . The globular N-terminal part of SARS-CoV S protein was almost not included in the GST-S (511-1255) construct.

The N protein of the MHV could elicit both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cell responses which contributed to the protection against coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis [Stohlman et al., 1992; Wege et al., 1993] . Chickens primed with the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of the IBV showed increased tracheal protection against challenge with live IBV [Boots et al., 1992] . Increased antibody titers against the nucleocapsid protein of human coronavirus could be detected in some paired sera of volunteers experimentally infected with human coronavirus 229E group viruses [Macnaughton et al., 1981] . The evidence implied that large amount of N protein may be produced in infected cells and the antigenicity of the N protein is very strong in vivo. Consistently, we found the N protein could elicit strong immune response (antibody production) at the early stage of SARS infection. Further studies are needed to understand whether the immune response against the N protein is associated with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.",

Since the false positive rate of the Nprotein based ELISA was 1.04% among healthy blood donors, the specificity of this ELISA was about 99%. It has been reported that antibodies against human 229E and OC43-like coronaviruses are widespread in the human population [McIntosh et al., 1970; Bradburne and Somerset, 1972] . According to the observation that there is no serological reactivity against SARS-CoV among healthy blood donors and patients with respiratory or other diseases in Hong Kong [Peiris et al., 2003b] , it suggests that there is no cross reactivity between the antibodies against previously known coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It still needs further studies to elucidate whether the false positive cases were caused by cross-reactivity of the antibodies against pre-existing human coronaviruses and the recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV. We also suggest to use immunoblotting to confirm those false positive samples as in the cases of detecting the anti-HIV or anti-HTLV antibodies.",

Transformed cells were induced by isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and their lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1 represents the cell lysate from noninduced SARS-CoV nucleocapsid/pGEX-1 transformed DH5a cells whereas lane 2 showed that from IPTG-induced cells. Lane 3 is the purified recombinant GST-N protein. Lane 4 shows the cell lysate from noninduced SARS-CoV GST-S (511-1255)/pGEX-1 transformed BL21 cells whereas lane 5 shows that from IPTG-induced cells. Lane 6 is the purified recombinant GST-S (511-1255) protein. The relative protein size is shown in the left side of the panel. The positions of induced products are indicated. B: The complete amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV (TW1) N proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The bold sequences are shown as the trypsin digested region identified under LC/MS/MS analysis. About 54% of the sequence for N protein was covered.",
