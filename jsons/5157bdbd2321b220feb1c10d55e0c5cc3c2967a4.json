When zero cats were set free, 51 people were infected on 40 average. For one set free, 55 were infected. For five free, 62 were infected. For ten 41 free, 76 were infected. This indicates that the fear over domestic cats may be 42 unnecessary, as abandoning domestic cats may cause even more people to be infected 43 overall (Figure S1).44 During the pandemic, it is necessary to surveil the susceptibility of viruses in 45 pets. However, managing pets does not mean abandoning them. Domestic animals 46 have adapted with humans for millennia and become companion animals with symbolic value [4].

Keywords: COVID-19; Coronavirus; Computer; Simulation; Domestic cats; Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been engulfing the world for more than four months [1]. Under the crisis, people have wondered whether the 26 causative pathogen, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, can infect pets [2]. Recently, it was reported that cats are susceptible to airborne infection of the virus [3], causing some to worry that they may have the potential to be the intermediate host. If future research proves that the virus can transmit between humans and cats, this may cause widespread panic and motivate people to abandon their cats for the fear of infection.",
