The challenges of SARS, Ebola, Influenza, Zika, and other diseases are immense. While we may guess which emerging or re-emerging disease may lead to the next possible catastrophe, we cannot know. The contemporary philosopher Yogi Berra is rumored to have said, \"Making predictions is hard, especially about the future\". There are some epidemiological topics that have already received some attention but are not yet fully developed. In the rest of this chapter we highlight some challenges, opportunities, and promising approaches in the study of disease dynamics at the population level.",

Contagion tends to succeed within environments or communities that \"facilitate\" modes of infection among its members. Contagion is an \"understood\" or \"believed\" mode of disease transmission or of \"socially transmitted\" behaviors, popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, a journalist who made use of his general understanding of the concept of \"contagion.\" In his construction of reasonable or plausible explanations for the observed and documented dramatic reductions in car thefts and violent crimes in New York City in the 1990s, [71] Gladwell expanded the use of the concept of contagion and tipping point in his development of a framework that captures-as the result of contagion-the spread of a multitude of social ills or virtues [72] . Specifically, contagion is seen in [71] as a force capable of starting and sustaining growth in criminal activity as long as a \"critical mass\" of individuals capable and willing to commit crimes is available. The growth in criminal activity in New York City is, according to Gladwell, the result of the \"interactions\" between a large enough pool of criminally active (infected) individuals and individuals susceptible to criminal contagion [71] . Gladwell extends the perspective pioneered by Sir Ronald Ross [141] and his \"students\" [90] [91] [92] to the field of social dynamics.",

            "text": "In epidemics, as in the rest of biology, the role of heterogeneity plays a fundamental role and a critical question arises: what is the level of heterogeneity that must be included to address a specific question properly? For example, first-order estimates of the fraction that must be vaccinated to eliminate a communicable disease can be handled with homogeneous mixing models while the elaboration of optimal vaccination strategies in real-life situations often require an age-structured model [28, 81] . The study of nosocomial (in-hospital) infections provides an additional example of the role of heterogeneity in transmission or degree of susceptibility or resistance [38, 39, 106] . The SARS epidemic provided a timely example of the criticality of heterogeneous mixing, in nosocomial transmission [85, 152] . Since there was no treatment available during the SARS epidemic, the main management approach rested on the effectiveness of isolation of diagnosed infectives, quarantine of suspected infectives, and early diagnosis. Quarantine was decided by tracing of contacts made by infectives but in fact few quarantined individuals developed SARS symptoms. The role of early diagnosis and the effectiveness of isolation seemed to have been the key to SARS control with improvements in contact tracing also playing an important role in epidemic control. Another set of questions arises when one considers the immunological history of individuals or populations. There are many instances in which more than one strain of a disease is circulating within a population and the possibility of cross-immunity between strains becomes important [3, 4] . Mathematically, co-strain co-circulation may lead to models that support a disease-free equilibrium (or non-uniform age distribution), equilibria in which only one strain persists, and an equilibrium in which two strains coexist. The role of cross-immunity in destabilizing disease dynamics (periodic solutions) has been studied extensively in the case of influenza models without age structure [57, 123, 124, 151] and also in age-structured models [29, 30] . Coinfections of more than one disease are also possible and their analysis requires more elaborate models. This is a real possibility with HIV and tuberculosis [96, 119, 133, 135, 140, 144, 154] .",

The evolution of resistance is generally associated with impaired transmission fitness compared to the sensitive strains of the infectious pathogen [112] . In the absence of treatment, resistant strains may be competitively disadvantaged compared to the sensitive strains and may go extinct. However, treatment prevents the growth and spread of sensitive strains, and therefore induces a selective pressure that favors the resistant strain to replicate and restores its fitness to a level suitable for successful transmission [2] . This phenomenon has been observed in several infectious diseases, in particular for management of influenza infection using antiviral drugs [138] .",

Through computer simulations, these studies have shown that, when resistance is highly transmissible, there may be situations in which increasing the treatment rate may do more harm than good by causing a larger number of resistant cases than the decrease in cases produced by treatment of sensitive infections. A recent epidemic model [156] has exhibited such behavior and suggested that there may be an optimal treatment rate for minimizing the final size [107, 111, 114] .",

Instead of studying the final size of an epidemic to measure the severity of a disease outbreak, it is more appropriate to consider the degree of prevalence of the disease in the population at endemic equilibrium as a measure of severity. For diseases such as tuberculosis, in which there are additional aspects such as reinfection, there may be additional difficulties caused by the possibility of backward bifurcations. The importance of understanding the dynamics of tuberculosis treatment suggests that this is a topic that should be pursued [60] .",

Cycling alternates both classes of drugs over pre-specified periods of time while mixing distributes both drugs simultaneously at random, that is, roughly half of the physicians would prescribe the first drug class while the other half would prescribe the second class. If the goal is to slow down single class drug resistance then \"mixing\" is the answer [16] while if the goal is to minimize dual resistance (if such a possibility exists) then the best option is cycling [38] . Of course, there are other factors that may accelerate resistance (physicians' compliance) or slow down resistance (quarantine and isolation).

Specifically, the theory of metapopulations, common to the study of the models in this book [104, 155] , was used to establish the role that localized disturbances have had in maintaining biodiversity [103, 127] . Kareiva et al. observe that there is a multitude of frameworks to study the role of disturbance, noting that, \"Models that deal with dispersal and spatially distributed populations are extraordinarily varied, partly because they employ three distinct characterizations of space: as 'islands' (or 'metapopulations'), as 'stepping-stones', or as a continuum\" [88] . We choose to deal with mobility in Chap. 15 and this chapter uses a metapopulation approach [80, 93, 104] , with populations that exist on discrete \"patches\" defined by some characteristic(s) (i.e., location, disease risk, water availability, etc.). As is customary, patches are connected by their ability to transfer relevant information among themselves, which, in the context of disease dynamics, is modeled by the ability of individuals to move between patches. Patches may be constructed (defined) by species (human and mosquito) with movement explicitly modeled via patch-specific residence times and under a framework that sees disease dynamics as the result of location-dependent interactions and location characteristic average risks of infection [17, 18] .",

In the rest of this chapter, we touch on some of the issues calling for the identification of an encompassing theoretical explanatory framework or frameworks. We do this by identifying some of the limitations of existing theory, in the context of particular epidemiological systems. The goal is fostering and re-energizing research that aims at disentangling the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics. In short, epidemic models on social landscapes are better formulated as complex adaptive systems. Now the question becomes, \"How does such a perspective help our understanding of epidemics and our ability to make informed adaptive decisions?\" These are huge complex questions whose answers have engaged a large number of interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary teams of researchers. What may be promising directions? In what follows, we discuss some of the modeling used to address some of the challenges and opportunities that we believe must be considered in the field of theoretical epidemiology.",

Disease risk is a function of the scale and the level of heterogeneity considered. Risk varies by countries and within a country by areas of localized poverty, or as a function of the availability and quality of sanitary/phytosanitary conditions, or as a result of access and the quality of health care, or variability on the levels of individual education, or as a result of engrained cultural practices and norms. Travel and trade, easily bypassing in today's world the natural or cultural boundaries defined by many of factors just outlined, are now seen as engines that drive the spread of pests and pathogens across regional and global scales. Hence, the identification of explanatory frameworks that help to disentangle the role of epidemiological, socioeconomic, and cultural perspectives on disease dynamics becomes evident and necessary in the Global Commons. Further, since the work of Sir Ronald Ross over a century ago [141] , efforts to develop a mathematical framework that allow us to tease out the role of various mechanisms on disease spread while enhancing our understanding of what may be the most effective measures to manage or eliminate a disease, the fields of mathematical and theoretical epidemiology have developed into rich and useful fields of their own. Their role in the development of public health policy and the study of disease evolution within hosts (immunology) and between populations and its relationship to the study of host-pathogen interactions within ecology or community ecology are now integral components of the education and training of theoreticians and practitioners alike [1, 12, 19-23, 26, 41, 53, 54, 59, 74, 76, 82, 102, 122, 157] .",

The \"physics or chemistry traditions\" are used to model disease transmission as the result of the \"collisions\" between individuals (with different energy or activity levels) in different epidemiological states. Further, movement, typically modeled using a metapopulation approach, is seen as the relocation between patches of non-identifiable individuals. The scholarly and extensive review in [83] addresses this perspective within homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing (age-structured) population models (see also [30] ). Weakening the assumption of homogeneous mixing via contacts in epidemiology has been addressed using network-based analyses that identify host contact patterns and clusters [13, 120, 121, 128] (and references therein with [121] offering an extensive review). Focusing on how each individual is connected within the population has been used to address the effects of host behavioral response on disease prevalence (see [67, 68, 110] for a review). Other approaches have included the effects of behavioral changes triggered by \"fear\" and/or awareness of disease [56, 66, 131, 134] . Although this stress-induced behavior may benefit public health efforts in some cases, it can also cause somewhat unpredictable outcomes [75] .",

Therefore, when we ask, what is the average rate of contacts that an individual has while riding a packed subway in Japan or Mexico City, or what is the average rate of contacts that an individual has at a religious event involving hundreds of thousands of people, including pilgrimages, one quickly arrives at the conclusion that different observers are extremely likely to arrive at very distinct understandings and quantifications of the frequency, intensity, and levels of heterogeneity involved. In short, this perspective puts emphasis on the use of a different currency (residence times) because measuring contacts at the places where the risk of infection is the highest, pilgrimages, massive religious ceremonies, \"Woodstock time events\", packed subways, and other forms of mass gathering or transportation have not been done to the satisfaction of most researchers. The risk of acquiring an infectious disease within a flight can be measured at least in principle as a function of the time that each individual of x-type spends flying, the number of passengers, and the likelihood that an infectious individual is on board. For example, measuring the risk of acquiring tuberculosis, an airborne disease that may spread by air circulation in a flight, may be more a function of the duration of the flight and the seating arrangement than the average rate of contacts per passenger within the flight (see [31] and references therein). Furthermore, replication studies that measure risk of infection in a given environment may indeed be possible under a residence time model. In short, the risks of acquiring an infection can be quantified as a function of the time spent (residence time) within each particular environment. The Lagrangian modeling approach builds (epidemiological) models by tracking individuals' patchresidence times and estimating their contacts according to the time spent in each environment [32] . The value of these models increases when we have the ability to assess risk as a patch-specific characteristic. In short, the use of a Lagrangian modeling perspective rather than the use of contacts is tied to the difficulties that must be faced when the goal is to measure the average rate of contacts per type-x individual in the environments that facilitate transmission the most.",

The Lagrangian approach [73, 125, 126] keeps track of the identity of hosts regardless of their geographical/spatial position. The use of Lagrangian modeling in living systems was, to the best of our knowledge, pioneered and popularized by Okubo and Levin [125, 126] in the context of animal aggregation.

Specifically, in [48, 142] , the effects of movement on patch population size at time t are ignored, namely, the population size in each Patch j is fixed at N j . In [139] , it is assumed that human mobility across patches does not produce any \"net\" change on the patch population size. On the other hand, in Model 16.3 the relationship between each patch population and mobility is dynamic and explicitly formulated. Moreover, the limited (vector [17] mobility is ignored) Lagrangian approach used here to model the dynamics of vector-borne diseases captures some unique features because the \"spatial\" structure of mosquitoes is not the same as that of humans. Mosquitoes are stratified into m patches (that may represent, for example, oviposition or breeding sites or forests) with infection taking place still within each Patch j , characterized by its particular risk \u03b2 vh a j for j = 1, . . . , m. Here, \u03b2 vh represents the infectiousness of human to mosquitoes bite with a j denoting the per capita biting rate in Patch j . Hosts, on the other hand, are structured by social groups or age classes (n). This residence habitat division can be particularly useful in the study of the impact of target control strategies.",

The effects of various forms of heterogeneity on the basic reproduction number have been explored in [17] , and we have found, for example, that the irreducibility of the residence-time matrix P is no longer sufficient to ensure a sharp threshold property, although the irreducibility of the host-vector network configuration is necessary for such property [17] .",

Here, we choose time-spatial-dependent risk, that is, we choose to handle social heterogeneity by keeping track of individuals' social or geographical membership. In this context, it is possible to include adaptive responses, for example, via the inclusion of prevalence-dependent dispersal coefficients. In this setting, the underlying hypothesis is that host behavioral responses to disease are automatic: either constant or following a predefined function. The average residence time P incorporates the average behavior of all hosts in each patch. This assumption is rather crude because it implicitly assumes that hosts have accurate information on health status and patch prevalence and respond to risk of infection accordingly. The incorporation of the role that human decisions, as a function of what individuals value and the cost that individuals place on these choices and trade-offs, within systems that account for the overall population disease dynamics has been addressed recently [61, 132] and discussed in economic epidemiology.",

Economic epidemiological modeling (EEM) has a history of addressing the role of individuals' behavior when facing the risk of disease. However, it has often failed to incorporate within host-pathogen feedback mechanisms [34-36, 52, 70, 97, 137] . EEMs that account for host-pathogen feedback mechanisms has propelled the study of the ways that contact decisions impact disease emergence or alter infectious disease-transmission dynamics. Decisions involved may include the determination to engage in trade on particular routes [89, 94, 95, 129] , or to travel to specific places [62, [147] [148] [149] , or to make contact with or to avoid particular types of people [61, 63, 116] . EEMs advance the view that the emergence of novel zoonotic diseases, such as SARS or the Nipah virus, depend on the choices that bring people into contact with other species [50, 51] . EEMs are usually built under the assumption that associated disease risks are among the factors that individuals must consider when making decisions.

It is assumed that individual decision problems are generated by rational-value formulations based on (driven by) personal, real or perceived, cost of disease, and disease avoidance: decisions constrained by underlying population-level disease dynamics.

In short, we have a complex adaptive system where individuals within the model, in this example, impact disease outcomes (through changes in the incidence). Eqs. (16.4) and (16.5) are both optimized from an individual perspective. Within this individual context, EEMs have shown that individual distancing, conditional on health status, plays an important role in the spread of infectious disease. However, it has also been shown that the provision of incentives for infectious individuals to self-quarantine is likely to be welfare-enhancing [43, 44, 61, 115] . Thus, understanding how the individual responds to relative costs of disease and disease prevention is critical to the design of public policy that affects those costs. Indeed, the role of recovered individuals in protecting susceptible individuals has been generally overlooked in public health interventions, and yet it is known that their behavior is, in fact, critical to disease management due to the positive externality the individuals' contacts generate once in an immune, non-disease-transmitting state [63] . The benefits of herd immunity include the positive externality associated with acquired immunity but may, in turn, be nullified by nontargeted social-distancing policies that induce such immune individuals to reduce contacts. By incentivizing the maintenance of contacts by recovered individuals policy may lower the probability of susceptible individuals contacting infected individuals and/or allow susceptible and infected individuals to individually increase contacts without changing the probability of infection.",

            "text": "Theoretical epidemiology aims to disentangle the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics. However, the role of behavior and individual decisions in response to a changing epidemic landscape has not been tackled systematically. In this chapter, we highlight alternative ways for modeling disease transmission that can use contacts as its currency or residence times or both. It seems evident that the use of contacts, in the context of influenza, Ebola, tuberculosis, or other communicable diseases (as opposed to sexually transmitted diseases), while intellectually satisfying, fails to recognized the fact that contacts cannot be measured effectively in settings where the risk of acquiring such infections is the highest. In fact, when contact-based models are fitted to data, it has become clear that contact rates play primarily the role of fitting parameters; in other words, if the goal is connecting models to data that include transmission mechanisms, then the use of contacts has serious shortcomings. Therefore, in order to advance the role of theory, we need models that are informed by data. Hence, the need to invest on efforts that bring forth alternative modes of modeling. While Lagrangian approaches are not a panacea, their use extends the possibilities because they depend on parameters like residence times and average time to infection for a given environment (risk), that is, parameters that can be measured. Frameworks should be explored and compared and their analyses contrasted. We have revisited recent work that equates behavior with cost-benefit decisions, which, in turn, are linked, within our framework, to health status and population-level dynamics, the components of a complex adaptive system. Connecting the Lagrangian movement-modeling approach with EEMs seems promising, albeit computationally and mathematically challenging. However, as discussed in [117] , the perception that the benefits of disease control are limited by the capacity of the weakest link in the chain to respond effectively is not a basic result of EEM models, which actually show that it may not be in within the ability of an individual in a poor community/country to do more risk mitigation. The need for richer communities or nations to find ways to incentivize greater levels of diseaserisk mitigation in poor countries may be the best approach. Simon Levin, in his address as the 2004 recipient of the Heineken award, placed our narrow perspective in a broader powerful context: A great challenge before us is thus to understand the dynamics of social norms, how they arise, how they spread, how they are sustained and how they change. Models of these dynamics have many of the same features as models of epidemic spread, no great surprise, since many aspects of culture have the characteristics of being social diseases. 1998 Heineken award winner Paul Ehrlich and I have been directing our collective energies to this problem, convinced that it is as important to understand the dynamics of the social systems in which we live as it is to understand the ecological systems themselves. Understanding the links between individual behavior and societal consequences, and characterizing the networks of interaction and influence, create the potential to change the reward structures so that the social costs of individual actions are brought down to the level of individual payoffs. It is a daunting task, both because of the amount we still must learn, and because of the ethical dilemmas that are implicit in any form of social engineering. But it is a task from which we cannot shrink, lest we squander the last of our diminishing resources.",

The symmetric residence times (p 12 = p 21 = \u03c3 12 = \u03c3 21 = 0.5) are described by the solid and dashed black curves. The blue curves represent the case where there is no movement between patches, that is, p 12 = p 21 = \u03c3 12 = \u03c3 21 = 0. The red curves represent the high-mobility case for which p 12 = p 21 = \u03c3 12 = \u03c3 21 = 1. If there is no movement between the patches (blue curves), the disease dies out in the low risk Patch 1 in both approaches with R 1 0 = \u03b2 1 d 1 +\u03b3 1 = 0.7636. The vertical axis represents the prevalence of the disease in Patch 1. Figure courtesy of Ref.[18]",

In the high-mobility case p 12 = p 21 = \u03c3 12 = \u03c3 21 = 1 (and then p 11 = p 22 = \u03c3 11 = \u03c3 22 = 0), the disease dies out (solid red curve) for P constant, withR 2 0 = \u03b2 1 \u03b3 2 +d 2 = 0.8571.For the constant residence-time matrix, the system is strangely decoupled because individuals of Patch 1 spend all their time in Patch 2, whereas individuals of Patch 2 spend all their time in Patch 1. Hence, Patch 2 individuals (d 2 and \u03bc 2 ) are subject exclusively to the environmental conditions that define Patch 1 (\u03b2 1 ), and so the basic reproduction of the \"isolated\" Patch 1 isR 2 0 = \u03b2 1 \u03b3 2 +d 2 and the disease dies out becauseR 2 0 = 0.8571. The disease persists if P state-dependent (dashed red curve) as p 12 (I 1 ,",
