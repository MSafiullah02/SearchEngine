The pH dependence of these traits was related with protonation changes of a conserved histidine (H54) located in the helix H3 of all forkhead domains7, due to the inferred role of this residue in protein\u2013DNA binding based on crystallographic9,10 and functional17 data. However, sequence comparison between several Fox members shows the presence of another histidine (H59) only in the M, O and P subfamilies7,17, which could also be relevant for protein function and stability (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of FoxP1 shows that both residues are surrounded by a hydrophobic environment (Fig. 1b), where their interaction ability is limited due to the effective contact radius (~5 \u00c5)18. In this scenario, the current structural and biophysical analysis is not sufficient to determine if the consequences observed in FoxP2 were due to changes in the protonation states of the strictly conserved H54 and/or the H59 that is only evolutionarily conserved in the M/O/P subfamilies.",

Kinetic analysis of domain swapping shows that only H59 is involved in dimer stability, with its deprotonation significantly increasing the association rate to favour the dimer conformation. This pH-dependent behaviour is also observed in equilibrium unfolding studies, where the global stability of the wt protein, and not the H59A mutant, depends on pH. Moreover, fluorescence anisotropy experiments monitoring local changes in helix H3 due to unfolding suggest that its stability is relevant to modulate the dimerization of FoxP1. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the protonation state of H59 affects the persistence of a hydrogen bond between its imidazole ring and the carbonyl group of the backbone of residue N55, as well as having a long-range effect in the contact probability of several native interactions on the folding transition state. Altogether, these findings highlight the relevance of H59 in the stability of helix H3 and the modulation of the dimerization propensity of FoxP proteins, providing insights of how key residue changes during the evolution of the Fox family of transcription factors aid in sculpting their folding landscape.",

We found that only His residues H54 and H59 are effectively titratable in the pH range used herein (data not shown). Thus, to experimentally elucidate the specific role of H59 protonation in the monomer-dimer transition, we generated the H59A mutant to interrupt any possible side chain interaction chemically related with the imidazole ring, and then we performed the same experiment as indicated for the wt protein. In this case, the H59A mutant lost the pH dependence of its monomer-dimer equilibrium, and also the kinetic decay was scarcely affected by pH changes when compared to the wt protein (Fig. 2b and Table 1).",

            "text": "In order to quantify how the protonation state of these residues affects the stability of the domain-swapped dimer, we calculated the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) at each pH. For the wt protein, Kd values were strongly affected by pH, ranging from 31.2 \u00b1 0.3 to 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM when pH is increased from 5.0 to 7.8 (Table 1). The free energy differences between monomer and dimer (\u2206Gd) as a function of pH calculated from Kd evidence a dramatic transition between pH 5.5 and 7.0. These results suggest that changes in the protonation state of His residues occurring in this pH range modulate domain swapping stability by ~2.4 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121, with an increase in Kd occurring at pH values in which His residues are expected to be protonated. In contrast, the H59A mutant shows a steady \u2206Gd of ~7.3 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121 (Table 1), with an increased dimer stability at pH values in which His residues are expected to be protonated (pH < 7) but a decreased stability when the His residue is expected to be deprotonated (pH > 7), when compared to the wt protein. These results suggest that the pH dependence of domain swapping with thermodynamics in the wt protein is due to the equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated forms of H59 instead of H54, concluding that the latter is mostly involved in protein-DNA interactions16 and does not participate, at least directly, in protein-protein interactions.",

Therefore, we fitted the dissociation kinetics of the wt and the H59A mutant proteins to single exponential decays to determine koff, and then kon was derived from the relationship between the equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants as in Eq. 1 (see Methods). Data obtained from these analyses (Table 1) indicates that the main effect of pH is on kon, showing a dramatic increase of ~50-fold when FoxP1 is changed from acidic to basic conditions with respect to the pKa of the imidazole ring.",

First, we observed that the \u2206G\u2021on and \u2206G\u2021off values described herein were significantly lower than those previously reported for other domain swapping models, such as the C\u2013terminal domain of SARS virus protease (Mpro\u2013C)20, despite the similar Kd (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S1). These results highlight the low kinetic barrier for domain swapping in FoxP1. Secondly, \u2206G\u2021on decreased by ~2.5 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121 upon increasing the pH above 6.0.

Taking into advantage the solely presence of H54 in this mutant, we used the Wyman\u2013Tanford relationship (Eq. 2, see Methods), which relates the pH-dependent free energy changes with the pKa of any residue involved in the dimerization process21, to determine the pKa changes of H54 and H59 in the dimerization pathway. Given that no significant changes in \u2206G\u2021on were observed for the H59A mutant upon changing the pH, the behaviour of H54 was explained by a pKa of ~5.3. Using this value as a fixed parameter for the analysis of the \u2206G\u2021on values obtained for the wt protein, we obtained the pKa of the H59 residue. Our values estimate a decrease of the pKa of this residue by approximately 1.8 units upon reaching the transition state for domain swapping (calculated pKa (M) = 7.3; pKa (\u2021) = 5.5; pKa (D) = 5.5).",

These results suggest that H59 is involved in the pH-dependent stabilization of helix H3.",

It is worth noting that, although the H++ server estimates that both H54 and H59 are titratable under the experimentally evaluated pH range herein, we only modified the charge state of H59 due to the negligible impact of H54 in protein folding and stability on FoxP1 (Fig. 3) and its side chain location on the protein surface (Fig. 1) to interact with the DNA16. Interestingly, the major differences observed between both simulations are located within helix H3. The introduction of a protonated histidine introduces a perturbation in the N-terminal region of this secondary structure element due to changes in hydrogen bonds between H59 and N55 from helix H3 (Fig. 5). Quantification of hydrogen bonds using a distance (donor-acceptor distance \u2264 3.0 \u00c5) and angle (\u226420\u00b0) criterion show that the imidazole ring of H59 and the backbone carbonyl group of N55 interact during ~20% of the simulation only in the deprotonated state, whereas distances between the backbone amide carbonyl groups of the same residues did not show relevant differences upon deprotonation (Fig. 5b). This change causes an increase of hydrogen bonding on helix H3 (Fig. 5b). These results suggest that the interaction of the side chain of deprotonated histidine and the carbonyl group of asparagine is key to stabilize the N-terminal region of helix H3.",

Simulations were run at several temperatures above and below TF allowed sampling several (>100) folding-unfolding transitions, thus allowing to integrate the data and calculate the folding landscape of monomeric FoxP1 (Supplementary Fig. S3). From these simulations, we observed a slight increase in TF upon deprotonation of H59. Then, we used folding equilibrium simulations at TF of the protonated FoxP1 to determine which native contacts were responsible for this change in stability and whether these changes occurred in the transition state (TS) or the native state. As shown in Fig. 5c, 7 native interactions showed a significant (>10%) increase in contact probability in the TS upon deprotonation. Moreover, these changes in contact probability were not present in the native state (data not shown). Most of the interactions involved regions near H59 (Supplementary Fig. S4), including four interactions between helix H1 and strand S2 (residue F62), and the native contact between H59 and N55 (Fig. 5c). The latter is in line with the results from explicit-solvent MD simulations for monomeric FoxP1 (Fig. 5b).",

This mutation could then represent an ancestral and specific physicochemical change to locally destabilize the monomer structure due to microenvironment changes, promoting the loosening of local regions and the association via domain\u2013swapping, which in turn allows stabilizing these elements in an intermolecular context.",
