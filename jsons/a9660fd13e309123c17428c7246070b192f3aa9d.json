Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were socially distancing.

No one experienced technical difficulties that prohibited joining the meeting. While the majority of patients elected to show their faces via webcam, those who deferred were still active discussants.Despite the physical distance, members confided in each other with a profound level of social closeness; \"Personally, I don't really talk about it -the only two people in my life that even know I have HS are my wife and my brother\" reported one participant within minutes of joining the discussion. Over the course of the hour-long conference, the participants freely discussed diverse topics -Many were concerned about their susceptibility for COVID-19 with current biologic use, and all agreed upon the silver lining in working from home; it makes coping with the pain and frequent care required of HS more manageable. They discussed robust participation on social media platform groups on Facebook and Instagram, as well as WhatsApp group chats with global membership. Patients with HS have seemingly been ahead of the virtual social movement, as studies demonstrate these patients obtain information about symptoms, home remedies, and prescription treatments online, even prior to a formal diagnosis by a dermatologist (Cole et al. 2019; Hessam et al. 2017). While patients with dermatological conditions certainly subscribe to support groups online, the use of live video support groups in this population is not well defined and may revolutionize how support groups are held in the future. In addition to HS, other groups of patients with documented socially isolating dermatologic diseases include Bechet's syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, facial port wine birthmarks and atopic dermatitis, which may benefit greatly from similar virtual support groups (Ozguler et al. 2019; Ogunsanya et al 2018; Vivar and Kruse 2018). A non-disclosure agreement signed by all participants prior to the meeting can protect confidentiality when groups are not held as part of an IRB-approved study with a formal consent form. In a time of widespread subscription to physical distancing, our patients with morbid dermatological disease may benefit immensely from live video conferencing support groups, and I encourage any dermatologist or trainee to facilitate one.",
