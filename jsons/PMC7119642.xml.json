            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCV) are a group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses represented by two known serogroups, designated OC43 and 229E when they were first isolated (Hamre and Procknow, 1966, McIntosh et al., 1967). These ubiquitous but not well studied viruses have been associated with \u223c30% of common colds in humans (Myint, 1995). Experimentally, both the 229E and OC43 prototype strains can infect human astrocytes and microglia in primary cultures (Bonavia et al., 1997) and their RNA was detected in a significant proportion of human autopsy brain samples (Stewart et al., 1992; Arbour and Talbot, unpublished results), which is consistent with their neurotropic potential. In clinical studies, various reports have associated human coronaviruses with nosocomial respiratory infections in premature newborns, as diagnosed by indirect immunofluorescence (Sizun et al., 1995), and enterocolitis in neonates with evidence of human coronaviruses shown by electron microscopy (Chany et al., 1982). Serodiagnosed human coronaviruses were also associated with exacerbations of asthma (Nicholson et al., 1993), and pericarditis (Riski and Hovi, 1980). Therefore, these viruses might be involved in diseases far more serious than mild upper respiratory tract infections.",

Various methods have been described for the detection of human coronaviruses. Virus isolation in cell culture is difficult, time-consuming and effective with adapted strains in specialised laboratories. Serological methods, mainly based on ELISA, were used for epidemiological studies but do not allow rapid virus identification (Kraaijeveld et al., 1980, McNaughton et al., 1983, Gill et al., 1994). Immunofluorescence with rabbit antisera was developed for the rapid detection of human coronaviruses in nasopharyngeal secretions (McIntosh et al., 1978). However, specificity of this technique was disputed because of cross-reaction between the two human coronaviruses strains, OC43 and 229E (Myint, 1995) and sensitivity was difficult to ascertain since no human coronaviruses antigen was detected in a prospective evaluation of 106 children hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. Detection of nucleic acids by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used in nasal aspirates (Myint et al., 1994). Nested PCR was apparently as sensitive as a combination of viral isolation in cell culture and serology.",

This corresponds to 4.83 and 1.84 log PFU/ml, respectively. On the other hand, RT-PCR was more sensitive for both viruses than IF since it allowed the detection of human coronaviruses in preparations containing as low as 1.75 or 1.5 log TCID50/ml of HCV-229E or HCV-OC43, respectively (Fig. 1\n). This corresponds to 2.3 and 1.34 log PFU/ml, respectively. Importantly, the RT-PCR assay did not detect input virions, since RT-PCR performed on RNA extracted from cells inoculated with virus at 4\u00b0C (where there is no viral penetration into cells) were negative (data not shown). However, it is not possible to evaluate the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay in terms of the amount of viral RNA since its proportion in total cellular RNA is not known.",

This is because the number of infectious virus particles in coronavirus-containing secretions is unknown. Moreover, reference methods such as the culture of clinical samples are difficult to carry out. Finally, possible double viral infections may adversely affect studies of specificity (Valenti et al., 1982, Wilson et al., 1989).",

Indeed, IF allowed the detection of human coronaviruses in cell suspensions with infectious viral titers of 4.25 log TCID50/ml for HCV-229E and 2.0 log TCID50/ml for HCV-OC43. No false positive signals were observed with human influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus and human adenovirus. Importantly, each mAb was human coronaviruses serogroup-specific. Polyclonal antibodies used in a previous study did not show such serogroup specificity since OC43-infected cells yielded a positive signal when the 229E-specific antibody was used (McIntosh et al., 1978). Epidemiological studies have shown that patients infected with the 229E strain of human coronaviruses rarely have circulating antibodies against the OC43 strain (Kapikian et al., 1969). Therefore, it would be interesting to distinguish between HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 during a clinical study and the serogroup-specific tests we describe would be useful for that purpose.",

In the only other published report on the detection of human coronaviruses by RT-PCR, the sensitivity of a nested PCR technique was compared in clinical samples to two techniques, ELISA and cell culture, the latter being only available for HCV-229E (Myint et al., 1994). The PCR technique appeared more sensitive than either cell culture or ELISA, but less than the two associated techniques. Specificity in clinical use was difficult to ascertain because of possible dual infections (human coronaviruses with either rhinovirus or influenza virus). These investigations used the classical single-step RNA extraction of Chomczynski and Sacchi (1989), which requires 3\u20134 h to execute, and they undertook two PCR amplification rounds. It would be difficult to obtain results within 1 day using this protocol. A simple cells lysis with DEPC-treated water and elimination of proteins and cell walls allowed us to perform RT-PCR for several samples very rapidly. The technique we used would be more appropriate for treating a large number of human samples containing few cells. We have already reported the use of the RT-PCR technique with clinical samples (Stewart et al., 1992, Bonavia et al., 1997).",
