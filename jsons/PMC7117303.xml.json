The rotavirus genome is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA and can undergo genetic reassortment during mixed infections, leading to progeny viruses with novel or atypical phenotypes. There were numerous descriptions of rotavirus strains isolated from human and animals that share genetic and antigenic features of viruses from heterologous species (Matthijnssens et al., 2006, Rahman et al., 2005, Santos and Hoshino, 2005). Recently, there were reports of novel rotaviruses that are apparently derived from transmission between human and sheep (Ciarlet et al., 2008, Matthijnssens et al., 2009). The emergence of novel strains derived from interspecies transmission has implications for design and implementation of successful reassortant rotavirus vaccine strategies.",

To date, 23 G and 31 P genotypes have been identified based on the glycosylated VP7 and the protease-sensitive VP4 (Schumann et al., 2009, Ursu et al., 2009). Recently, a novel classification system based on the nucleotide sequences of all rotavirus genome segments has been suggested (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a, Matthijnssens et al., 2008b) enabling a comprehensive characterization of rotavirus strains. Based on nucleotide identity cut-off percentages, different genotypes were defined for each genome segment. The calculated cut-off values for the 11 rotavirus RNA segments VP7, VP4, VP6, VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP5/6 are 80%, 80%, 85%, 83%, 84%, 81%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85% and 91%, respectively. To designate the complete genetic makeup of a virus, the schematic nomenclature was proposed: Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx, representing the genotypes of respectively the VP7\u2013VP4\u2013VP6\u2013VP1\u2013VP2\u2013VP3\u2013NSP1\u2013NSP2\u2013NSP3\u2013NSP4\u2013NSP5/6 encoding gene segments, with x indicating the number of the corresponding genotypes.",

Diarrhea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal dairy and beef calves, and substantial economic loss occurs due to increased morbidity and mortality, treatment costs, and reduced growth rates (House, 1978). For example, livestock and poultry production with $70 billion per year industry in the United States is estimated to suffer a 15\u201320% annual loss in potential productivity from disease and environmental problems (United States Department of Agriculture, 1987), in which, calf loss from diarrhea is an important segment of total loss in cattle industry. It was reported in the late 1970s that enteric pathogens killed up to 25% of calves per year, resulting in more than $250 million in losses (Hunt, 1985). Rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli strain K99, coccidia and Cryptosporidium parvum are the main infectious agents inducing enteric infections in neonatal calves less than 2 months of age. Among the pathogens described above, rotavirus as a major cause of neonatal bovine diarrhea (Bellinzoni et al., 1990, Bendali et al., 1999, de la Fuente et al., 1998, Maes et al., 2003, Reynolds et al., 1986) was found to be responsible for approximately 46% of the scours cases in dairy calves (Snodgrass et al., 1986). In addition to causing economic losses, diarrhea in livestock is important because of the public health implications. Thus, the availability of a safe and effective bovine rotavirus vaccine capable of preventing this enormous economic and public health burden would represent a global goal.",

In addition, availability in the early 1990s of a reliable and relatively easy methodology for rotavirus G and P genotyping accelerated this trend (Das et al., 1994, Fischer and Gentsch, 2004, Gentsch et al., 1992, Gouvea et al., 1990). Such information has indeed influenced the approaches to the development of an effective rotavirus vaccine. For example, additional candidate human rotavirus vaccines have been constructed that would give antigenic coverage not only for G1\u2013G4 but also G5, G6 and G8\u201310 as well as P1A[8], P1B[4] and P2A[6] (Hoshino et al., 2005). However, there was limited research in the field of animal rotavirus vaccine. The bovine rotavirus isolate (the Lincoln strain, G6 genotype) was adapted to serial propagation in cell culture (Fernelius et al., 1972, Mebus et al., 1971), which resulted in an attenuated virus for calves (Mebus et al., 1973). This attenuated strain was incorporated into a vaccine licensed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1973 for oral inoculation of newborn calves or intramuscular inoculation of pregnant cows to provide passive protection to their calves. Apart from this, there was no advent of new bovine rotavirus vaccine in the world.",

Next to the G6 and G10 genotypes, G8 is the third typical bovine rotavirus genotype (Alfieri et al., 2004, Chang et al., 1996, Falcone et al., 1999, Garaicoechea et al., 2006, Monini et al., 2008, Parwani et al., 1993, Reidy et al., 2006, Snodgrass et al., 1990). In China, our epidemiologic surveillance has shown that rotavirus diarrhea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal calves, and that G6 and G10 were also determined to be the most prevalent genotype of the bovine rotaviruses using nested RT-PCR and sequencing (Chang et al., 2008). Since monovalent rotavirus vaccine cannot completely protect against heterologous rotavirus infection (Feng et al., 1994), the multivalent rotavirus vaccine candidates are the most important research goal for the protective immunity of rotaviruses. In addition, the reassortant rotavirus vaccine approaches have been successfully employed to develop various human rotavirus candidate vaccines that include rhesus rotavirus based and bovine rotavirus based multivalent vaccines listed earlier (Hoshino et al., 2002, Hoshino et al., 2003, Hoshino et al., 2005, Midthun et al., 1985, Midthun et al., 1986). In this study, an ovine rotavirus strain LLR-85-based bovine rotavirus reassortant was constructed and combined with its parental virus LLR-85 as bivalent vaccine candidates for providing an attenuation phenotype of an ovine rotavirus in bovines and antigenic coverage of the main bovine rotavirus genotypes for G6 and G10. Our study showed that the bivalent vaccine candidates can induce immune response of IgG and IgA antibodies in the sera of the inoculated colostrum-deprived neonatal calves, and fecal shedding of rotavirus is uncommon following oral inoculation of calves with the rotavirus vaccine candidates.",

The ovine rotavirus strain LLR-85 (G10 P[15]) (Chen et al., 2009, Knipe and Peter, 2007), which was initially derived from a lamb with diarrhea in Qinghai province, China, in 1981 (Zhou et al., 1985), was propagated from monovalent human rotavirus vaccine LLR (Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, China) (Bai et al., 1994). These virus strains were adapted to growth in MA104 cell line, and passaged 10 times on DMEM medium (GIBCO) before a triple plaque purification. Colostrum-deprived newborn calves without antibodies to rotavirus were divided into three groups to orally inoculate candidate vaccines within 24 h after their birth.

            "text": "In view of rotavirus genotypes G6 and G10 predominating in cattle worldwide, and the Jennerian and modified Jennerian approaches being successfully employed to develop various rotavirus candidate vaccines, we constructed G10-based bovine rotavirus reassortant followed by molecular and biological characterization. MA104 cells were co-infected with bovine rotavirus strain NCDV and ovine rotavirus strain LLR-85 at an m.o.i. of one, and the progeny viruses grew without selective pressure for generating resssortant. 450 plaques were picked to screen for LLR-85-based reassortant with single NCDV-VP7 gene substitution. All plaques were routinely picked for initial screening by RNA PAGE analysis, and the indistinguishable RNA segments were further analyzed by sequence analysis for confirmation. As indicated in Fig. 1\n, electrophoretic migration patterns of genomic RNAs of the parental viruses and the desired reassortant showed that the desired reassortant derived VP1, VP2, VP3 and NSP3 gene segments from the LLR-85 strain, and derived VP7 gene segment from the NCDV strain. The remaining gene segments could not be confirmed by RNA PAGE, and were further confirmed by sequence analysis. A comparison of VP4, NSP1, VP6, NSP2, NSP4 and NSP5 gene segments of the desired reassortant with that of the parental viruses was shown in Table 3\n. For the VP4, NSP1, VP6, NSP2, NSP4 and NSP5 genes, nucleotide sequence identities between the reassortant and LLR-85 were 99.8%, 99.9%, 99.7%, 99.9%, 100% and 100%, respectively, whereas nucleotide sequence identities between the reassortant and NCDV were 71.1%, 76.0%, 84.4%, 87.6%, 81.2% and 92.7%, respectively, indicating that the desired reassortant derived VP4, NSP1, VP6, NSP2, NSP4 and NSP5 gene segments from the LLR-85 strain. Thus, the ovine rotavirus LLR-85-based reassortant with a single VP7 gene of bovine rotavirus strain NCDV, named as R191 here, was confirmed by RNA PAGE (Fig. 1) and sequence analysis (Table 3). R191 as well as its parental strains NCDV and LLR-85 were propagated on confluent monolayers of MA104 cells at the equal m.o.i. of 0.1 to determine the growth property of the reassortant. Infection was terminated at postinoculation hours 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72, and the titers of the harvested viruses were determined as plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml by plaque assay technique. The results showed that the titers of the R191 and LLR-85 on peak days of virus growth were very similar (107.4 and 107.2\n PFU/ml, respectively) (Fig. 2\n), indicating that the replication efficiency of the reassortant R191 in MA104 cells was not influenced by substitution of the VP7 gene.",

Two calves in the group 1 were inoculated with the reassortant R191, another two calves in the group 2 were inoculated with the parental rotavirus LLR-85, and seven calves in the group 3 were simultaneously inoculated with the reassortant R191 and the parental rotavirus LLR-85. Blood samples were collected at PIDs 0, 10, 21 and 28 to prepare serum. All sera were diluted hundredfold to detect IgG and IgA antibodies to group A rotavirus by indirect ELISA. The kinetics of rotavirus-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in sera of the calves inoculated with the rotavirus vaccine candidates were depicted in Fig. 3\n. Results showed that seroconversion of IgG and IgA antibodies to the rotavirus occurred at PID 10 in all of the inoculated calves, and increased to the peak at PID 21. Serum samples at PID 21 in all of the calves were serially twofold diluted starting at a dilution of 1:100 followed by detection of the titers of rotavirus-specific IgG and IgA antibodies to group A rotavirus by indirect ELISA. The results showed that the titers of serum IgG antibodies were between 1:800 and 1:6400 and the titers of serum IgA antibodies were between 1:800 and 1:3200 (Table 4\n).",

Results showed that in the three inoculated groups during the first 7 days of oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates, 2 of 77 fecal specimens (2.6%) collected from the 11 inoculated calves contained the inoculated rotavirus. The two rotavirus-positive specimens were collected from the same calf (no. 4) in the group 3 at the first and third day postinoculation. No inoculated rotavirus was detected in other fecal specimens collected from the inoculated calves between 1 and 7 days postinoculation.

This virus was initially referred to as neonatal calf diarrhea virus, Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, reo-like virus, or reovirus-like agent but is now known as bovine rotavirus; the name rotavirus was ultimately chosen because of the wheel-like appearance of the virus on transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Today rotaviral infections are proven to be a common, economically important cause of calf diarrhea throughout the world. Genotypic analyses of a major neutralization protein VP7 of a bovine rotavirus in diarrheal stools collected in different cattle populations throughout the world have shown that the majority of typeable rotavirus isolates belong to G genotypes 6 and 10 (Alfieri et al., 2004, Chang et al., 1996, Falcone et al., 1999, Garaicoechea et al., 2006, Monini et al., 2008, Parwani et al., 1993, Reidy et al., 2006, Snodgrass et al., 1990). Since the first licensed bovine rotavirus vaccine was a monovalent one, monovalent rotavirus vaccine cannot completely protect against heterologous rotavirus infection (Feng et al., 1994). We constructed a reassortant rotavirus strain R191 that contains a single VP7 gene encoding genotype G6 specificity of bovine rotavirus NCDV strain and the remaining 10 genes of ovine rotavirus strain LLR-85. The reassortant R191 and its parental rotavirus strain LLR-85 were used as bivalent vaccine candidates to provide: (i) an attenuation phenotype of an ovine rotavirus in bovines; and (ii) antigenic coverage for G6 and G10 of the main bovine rotavirus genotypes. The attenuated virus strains R191 and LLR-85 were shown experimentally in colostrum-deprived neonatal calves to be able to induce high levels of serum IgG and IgA antibodies to rotavirus, whereas fecal shedding of the rotaviruses was uncommon in the inoculated calves, and therefore are promising bivalent vaccine candidates for prevention of bovine G6 and G10 rotavirus infection.",

            "text": "The mechanisms responsible for immunity to rotavirus infections and illness are not completely understood in animals (Knipe and Peter, 2007). Animal models have been particularly instructive in elucidating the role of antibodies and in dissecting the relative importance of systemic and local immunity. Initially, the observations of some related studies suggested that antibodies in the lumen of the small intestine were the primary determinant of resistance to rotavirus illness, whereas circulating serum antibodies failed to protect (Bridger and Woode, 1975, Offit and Clark, 1985, Snodgrass and Wells, 1976, Woode et al., 1975). But the subsequent study showed that systemic rotavirus antibodies are present in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract of neonatal calves if the level of circulating antibodies is sufficiently high. Such serum-derived mucosal antibodies can provide protection against experimentally induced infection and diarrhea (Besser et al., 1988). The association between the titers of serum anti-rotavirus IgG and IgA antibodies and protection against infection and illness was investigated in 100 children under 18 months of age attending day care centers in the United States for one or two rotavirus seasons (O\u2019Ryan et al., 1994). These studies showed that preexisting serum anti-rotavirus IgA titer of greater than 1:200 or IgG titer of greater than 1:800 was associated with protection against infection. A similar study of Mexican infants also demonstrated that both serum IgA and IgG were protective, but the titers needed to achieve significant protection were higher than those found in the US study (Velazquez et al., 2000). These previous studies about the association between serum anti-rotavirus antibodies and protection against infection and illness suggested that serum antibodies, if present at critical levels, are either protective themselves or are an important and powerful correlate of protection against rotavirus disease, even though other host effectors may play an important role as well. In this study, we want to evaluate the immunogenicity of the rotavirus vaccine candidates, so we used the major structural protein in virus particles of the semipurified BRV as antigen to detect the IgG and IgA antibodies against the group A rotavirus in serum of the inoculated calves. And the results showed that the highest titers of serum IgG and IgA antibodies were obtained at PID 21, the calves in all inoculated groups developed high levels of serum anti-rotavirus IgG antibodies (range 1:800 to 1:6400) and serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies (range 1:800 to 1:3200). These results suggested that the animals inoculated with LLR-85-based vaccine candidates would develop antibodies to the inoculated viruses, and indicated that the attenuated virus strains LLR-85 and R191 were well immunogenic to neonatal calves, and preexisting serum anti-rotavirus IgA titers (range 1:800 to 1:3200) reached to level of protective immunity. However, further evaluation is needed for a protective immune response of the LLR-85-based candidate vaccines in future trials.",

In recent years, rare genotypes of bovine rotavirus (such as G5 and G15.) were also isolated in calves (Ghosh et al., 2008, Park et al., 2006). So with this procedure, additional LLR-85-based reassortant rotavirus vaccine candidates that carry VP7 gene encoding a desired bovine rotavirus G genotype specificity can be generated readily in the future when the need for such G genotype(s) is warranted from epidemiologic studies.",
