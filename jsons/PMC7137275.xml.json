The clinical picture of the disease is diverse and vary from flu-like illness to severe disease with multi-organ failure and death [3]. Clinical management of leptospirosis is always a challenge to the physicians due to the highly variable nature of its presentation. Traditionally, complications of leptospirosis are described in the second (immune) phase of the disease [3]. The most common reported causes of death in leptospirosis included respiratory, cardiac, or renal failure, and septic shock [4]. Rarely, early complications and death were attributed to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction [5].",

The pathogenesis of leptospirosis is still not fully described; however; the innate immune-mediated complications are described. Several molecules of the infectious agents like lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins, outer membrane protein and the glycolipoprotein have been implicated with the disease [3, 9]. It is proposed that the pathogenesis of leptospirosis is driven through the cytokine response [10].",

            "text": "Many viral infections show an abnormal immune response and cytokine production [11]. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is closely linked to the host innate and adaptive immune response. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A) promote clinical manifestations of DHF [12]. Pathogenesis of Ebola virus is influenced by multiple factors out of which excessive inflammatory response is a significant feature [13]. The potential source of inflammatory cytokines during multiple viral hemorrhagic fever infections could vary. Dendritic cells secrete minimal amounts of cytokines since they are targeted by multiple viruses (arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses). However, monocytes and macrophages appear to be playing a dominant role in secreting inflammatory cytokines during these infections [11]. Severe systemic clinical manifestations of gram-positive sepsis are also attributed to the non-specific pathogen-associated molecular pattern effect of peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid which trigger toll-like receptor 2 and induce inflammation. Similarly, lipopolysaccharides has its inflammatory effect through trigger toll-like receptor 4 [14]. The function of the immune system is to eliminate the microbial pathogen by producing pro-inflammatory agents such as cytokines. However, tissue injury could be possible with excessive production of cytokines [15]. We aim to systematically review the previous evidence on cytokine response in leptospirosis at different clinical outcomes.",

In addition, studies also reported IL-1\u03b2 [21, 26], IL-12P70 [21, 26] and TNF-\u03b1 [21, 23, 26, 36], levels as low or undetectable in leptospirosis patients and healthy controls. Higher levels of IL-8 [36], IL-10 [36] and lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 [36] were found to be associated with better prognosis. The first, 5 days of infection showed peak levels of IL-1RA, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1; the second 5 days had peak levels of GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IP-10 and MIP-1\u03b1; VEGF peaked at 11\u201315 days [33]. Tuero et al. 2010 revealed a significantly less peripheral blood mononuclear cell production of IL10 in patients than in controls [25]. Kyriakidis et al. 2011 showed that the day of illness is a determinant of cytokine levels and that the age of the patients correlates with sTNFR1 levels [24]. An involvement of Th17 cells in the immunopathogenesis of leptospirosis was proposed by Bandara et al. 2018 because an increase in IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-23 levels were observed [20]. Latha et al. 2015 demonstrated significant levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in sera which were reactive in Leptospira tarassovi outer membrane protein IgM ELISA [34]. Wang et al. 2012 revealed that the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is induced by hemolysin of Leptospira interogans in human macrophages [22]. Table 1 summarizes mean (SD) of the five most commonly reported cytokines among leptospirosis patients with different outcomes and the controls (Fig. 3).\n",

Liver insufficiency also had elevated levels of IL-23 and TNF-\u03b1 [20] than in mild disease. A study revealed a significantly lower TNF-\u03b1 with pulmonary disease [33] while another study had higher TNF-\u03b1 levels in pulmonary disease [24].

            "text": "The review had data from studies which included leptospirosis patients with varying degree of severity. Although, the review produced valuable data on the possible role of cytokines in leptospirosis disease severity, there were equivocal findings with regards to IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10/TNF- \u03b1 ratio among the selected studies. Failure to measure soluble TNF receptor-1 (sTNFR1) might have led to low levels of TNF-\u03b1 in some studies, as the bound TNF-\u03b1 will not be included in the analysis [37]. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were proposed to be pro-inflammatory cytokines which enhance the inflammatory response in leptospirosis [10]. However, the present review found IL-1\u03b2 to be low among leptospirosis patients, IL-6 to be elevated and TNF-\u03b1 to be equivocal. The above findings could be due to the variation in the time of sample collection in relation to the onset of the symptoms. Nevertheless, results among the complicated leptospirosis showed elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 which shows a higher degree of pro-inflammatory action. In contrast, IL-10 is thought to be the most important anti-inflammatory cytokine which restores the immunological homeostasis in leptospirosis [10]. In addition, IL-4 and IL-13 restrict the inflammatory response [10]. The present review revealed elevated levels of the above-mentioned anti-inflammatory cytokines among leptospirosis patients and patients with complicated disease. The findings suggest that anti-inflammatory response is also expected to increase in complicated leptospirosis. Therefore, a low IL-10 / TNF-\u03b1 is most probable among patients with complicated disease.",

Similar to the present review, IL-6 [38], IL-8 [38], IL-10 [38, 39], IP-10 [38], MCP-1 [38], TNF-\u03b1 [40, 41] and VEGF [39] were found to be elevated in DHF, a condition common to almost all endemic settings for leptospirosis. IL-6, IL-12, IL-1RA, IP-10, and MCP-1 were also found to be elevated in chikungunya [42\u201344]. Hanta virus infection, a disease which can mimic pulmonary leptospirosis, had shown elevation of GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12P40, IL-17 and VEGF [45]. Fatal outcomes from Plasmodium falciparum malaria showed elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 than in survival which was comparable to the results on leptospirosis [46]. Cerebral malaria was found to have high levels of TNF-\u03b1 in fatal outcomes [46]. Moreover, Ebola viral infection showed elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in non-survivors similar to the present review [47, 48]. It is interesting to note that IL-6 was found to be elevated in leptospirosis, DHF, chikungunya, hanta virus, malaria and Ebola infections. However, cytokine response alone cannot be used to differentiate the above conditions.",

The above fact emphasizes the need of cytokine selection in relation to the day of illness, if we are to use the cytokine levels for disease monitoring. The selected studies were heterogeneous, and the methods used for the diagnosis of leptospirosis and measurement of cytokines varied between studies, making it impossible for proper evidence synthesis. Although, the quality assessment revealed few drawbacks such as reporting of sample size and the lack of adjustment for confounders, overall the quality was fair. Nevertheless, the review points out the importance of clinical assessment as the cytokine response in leptospirosis is still poorly understood, and published literature are highly inadequate to produce a clear picture.",
