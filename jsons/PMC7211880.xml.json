These pathways exist at many scales, describing transmission among individuals [1], farms [2] and countries [3]. Trading connections among farms can generate vast networks of animal movements [4], which have been implicated in disease transmission [5,6]. Network epidemiology uses these networks as a framework on which to model the spread of infection [7] and measures describing the centrality of a farm in a trading network and the nature of its contact chains (describing temporal connectedness) can be useful in assessing an individual farm's risk of acquiring infection [8].",

Despite intense study and significant resources invested in control measures, the infection remains endemic in large parts of Great Britain [10]. Among other factors, wildlife reservoirs of infection, most notably in badgers Meles meles, and undetected infections and movements of cattle have been shown to contribute to disease persistence and spread. A dynamic transmission model using British cattle movement and bTB testing data from 1996 to 2011 predicted that the movements of cattle alone accounted for 13% of bTB incidents and played a further role in multifactorial bTB incidents [11]. Modelling by Green et al. [12] suggested that in 2004, 16% of herd infections occurred as a result of cattle movements and that local effects were more important. The effects of cattle movements on patterns of bTB incidence in Great Britain have varied across regions [13,14] and over time as new policies have been implemented [15]. However, in spite of the introduction of pre-movement and, in some limited circumstances, post-movement testing for animals leaving high-incidence areas [15\u201317], studies using data from 2006 to 2013 still suggested that there was an increased risk of bTB incidents for herds that had purchased cattle from high-risk regions of England and Wales [17\u201319].",

            "text": "When compared to other risk factors for bTB incidents, such as location and herd type, cattle movements represent an activity that might be more amenable to management, for example, by the use of risk-based trading, regulation or legislation. While the role of direct cattle movements in the transmission of bTB in Great Britain has been well-documented, the risks associated with indirect movements arising from trade have not yet been quantified or explored in detail. Second-order contacts (i.e. contacts of contacts) in farm networks have been shown to improve the estimates of simulated epidemic size in models of disease in the British cattle herd [20] and, in Italy, influence the roles of individual farms in disease transmission [21]. In order to interrogate the farm trading network beyond first-order, direct contacts, data on the sequential purchases of cattle can be used to construct temporally explicit contact chains among farms. The ingoing contact chain (ICC) represents the source farms that may contribute infection to the root farm, while the outgoing contact chain represents those farms to which the root farm might transmit infection. The magnitude of ingoing contact chains has been associated with the risk of bTB in French cattle [8] and was used to inform risk-based targeting of farms for surveillance of bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in Sweden [22].",

In the present study, we hypothesize that farms with larger numbers of farms in their ICCs are at greater risk of exposure and acquisition of infection. We predict that infection risks might therefore be greater for farms with ICCs that include more risky trading partners, such as those that have experienced a recent bTB incident or that are located in regions with high incidence rates. We also predict that the closer a farm is to the root farm, both in terms of geographical proximity and trading proximity, the more impact it will have on disease risk on the root farm. It has been established that risk factors are likely to vary across different geographical regions [14,23]. Therefore, we performed multiple analyses using subsets of data from specific regions. Overall, our study aimed to assess the importance of new parameters from contact chains based on trading networks, alongside established risk factors, on the risk of bTB incidents on cattle farms in Great Britain.",

Study farms were active premises (i.e. registered cattle holdings with a birth, death or movement) between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014 with full bTB testing and location data, resulting in a final dataset comprising 71 096 cattle farms. Annual herd size was derived from the mean daily number of cattle on the premises. We took the mean of these annual herd sizes across the three years of the study. Herd type was defined using CTS data, first by the predominant breed type (dairy, beef or dual purpose) and then sex of animals on the farm (as outlined in [4]). Farms were allocated to bTB risk areas for England based on the designated risk area of their county parish defined by APHA in 2015 [24] (electronic supplementary material, methods and figure S1). A farm was defined as having had a bTB incident if its officially tuberculosis free (OTF) status was withdrawn (OTF-W) or suspended (OTF-S) on one or more days during the time period in question, i.e. for assessing previous bTB history this period was 2010\u20132014, and for our response variable, it was 2015\u20132016. OTF status is suspended (OTF-S) if at least one animal tests positive (or returns two inconclusive test results) for M. bovis, using either of the statutory live tests: the single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test or the gamma interferon test, and is withdrawn (OTF-W) upon finding post-mortem pathology characteristic of M. bovis or isolation of the bacteria by culture. Both types of incident were included in the analysis in order to maximize the power of tests of the association between infection in the contact chain and subsequent incidents. Two additional analyses were performed with each type of incident as the response variable (OTF-S and OTF-W), but final outcomes did not change substantially and so the simpler, combined analysis is presented here.",

Betweenness centrality was calculated for each root farm in each network, providing a centrality measure of the importance of the farm in connecting together different parts of the network [25]. ICCs are comprised of farms linked by movements of animals onto farms in a chronological sequence, such than at least one animal from a movement could have potentially seeded an infection that could, in principle, be passed on in a subsequent movement of animals from that farm. Any farm that may have contributed to infection on the root farm (via movements) within the study period is included in the chain as a \u2018source farm'. The \u2018level' for each source farm corresponds to the minimum number of movements away from the root farm at which they appear in the ingoing contact chain. To avoid any seasonal effect of starting the chain in a specific month, we calculated 24 ICCs at one month intervals, each spanning 12 months of movements. We then grouped the source farms from each of the 24 ICCs. Where farms appeared more than once in the chain in any one year, we included them at the closest (minimum) level to the root farm and removed other instances. Each chain was curtailed at eight levels away from the root farm due to computational limitations (electronic supplementary material, methods).",

We recorded the mean distance between each root farm and all of their source farms at each level. To incorporate bTB risks from local farms, we calculated the proportion of farms that had experienced a bTB incident between 2010\u20132014, within a radius of 0\u20132 km, 0\u20134 km, 0\u20136 km, 0\u20138 km and 0\u201310 km of the root farm. Location was defined by the (x, y) coordinates associated with a particular holding identity (County Parish Holding number) in the APHA data. There are limitations with this proxy for farm location because, in some cases, the point location of the CPH does not lie within farmland where cattle are mostly located. However, there is no known systematic spatial bias to these locations, sample size is very large and there are no validated alternatives at this scale. Thus, this is the best proxy to use, and it has been used in previous studies [13,18]. We selected baseline variables for a regression model based on previously identified risk factors [19,23] listed in table 1.\n",

Various risk factors could be specified at different lags (e.g. distances or levels of the network). However, the inclusion of multiple variables corresponding to a single-risk factor specified at different lags results in high multicollinearity and thus model instability. Instead, we chose a single representative variable within each set of lagged variables by adding each lagged variable in turn to this baseline model and choosing the one with the lowest value of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [26]. This avoided the inclusion of a large number of highly correlated variables and problems with inference caused by singularity errors in the design matrix, while preventing excessive model selection and therefore reducing bias in the estimated coefficients of the model [27]. As an example, to select the most suitable lag for the risk of bTB from the local area, we ran five multivariable regression models including each distance with the baseline risk factors described above (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). The model with the lowest AIC included the proportion of farms with bTB during 2010\u20132014 within a radius of 8 km from the farm, and so this term was included in the final model. This process was repeated to select representative variables from two sets of contact chain variables; those we expected to be associated with increased or decreased risk of a bTB incident on the root farm (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). The final model included all baseline explanatory variables, the proportion of farms in a radius of 0\u20138 km with a recent bTB incident and the selected representative source farm variables: the number of farms located in the England High-Risk Area at levels 1\u20133, and the number of farms located in the England Low-Risk Area at levels 1\u20138 of the ICC (table 1). To capture potential differences in aetiology between different regions, we grouped our root farms by their region (electronic supplementary material, figure S1) and performed the same multivariable analysis, only removing region as an explanatory variable.",

In terms of network factors, having more farms in the ICC in the England Low-Risk Area decreased the odds of a bTB incident more for root farms in the England Low-Risk Area than for farms in the full Great Britain dataset. In terms of previously established risk factors, the odds of having a repeat bTB incident on root farms in the England Low-Risk Area and in Scotland following an incident in the preceding 5-year period were over fifteen times greater than those for farms which experienced no bTB incident in that period. Similarly, the odds of bTB incidents on farms in the England Low-Risk Area were almost five times greater if they had experienced a previous incident. For root farms in the England High-Risk Area, England Edge Area and in Wales, a repeat incident had more than twice the odds of occurring than a first-time incident. Larger herds had at least thirteen times the odds of experiencing a bTB incident than smaller farms in all regions. Compared to other herd types, dairy farms still had increased odds of experiencing a bTB incident in 2015\u20132016 in the England High-Risk Area and England Edge Area. Local effects were strongest in Wales where the proportion of farms within 8 km with previous bTB incidents was associated with almost eight times higher odds (electronic supplementary material, table S2).

            "text": "Our study covers the period 2010\u20132016, 4 to 10 years after the introduction of comprehensive pre-movement testing, and selective post-movement testing, and indicates that there remains an increased risk of bTB incidents associated with direct and indirect trading with farms in the England High-Risk Area (including trades within the England High-Risk Area). While we found a modest effect (OR = 1.23) of having made a direct purchase from the England High-Risk Area, our results suggest that there is scope for further reductions in the risks of acquiring bTB through trading links. For herds with non-negligible levels of infection, the SICCT test has reasonable sensitivity when considered as a herd-level test [32]; however, when used for pre- and post-movement testing on small batches of cattle (the median number of animals per trade between 2002 and 2015 was 2 with an interquartile range of 1\u20134 [4]), its sensitivity is likely to be much lower [33], resulting in frequent false negatives and the undesirable movement of truly infected animals. Although farms tend to trade directly most often within their regions [34] and pre- and post-movement testing has been shown to deter movements between regions [17], we show that extensive inter-regional connections are quickly formed in the contact chains of many farms. We observed that within a few movements, large areas of Great Britain might be traversed by cattle movements and that farms can be connected to many farms outside of their risk area or geographical region. While relatively few of these connections are likely to transmit infection, those that do may be effective in translocating disease into new areas [35]. The use of more sensitive diagnostics such as the gamma interferon assay [36] in movement-associated testing, both within and out of annually tested areas, might serve to deter purchase of animals from the England High-Risk Area, due to higher costs, and also to reduce transmission between farms, as the risk of moving infected animals would be reduced. Risk-based trading protocols, including those that quantify direct trading risk, have been outlined elsewhere [37], and including an estimate of the risk associated with indirect trading, using the locations and numbers of source farms might lead to better understanding of the totality of risk associated with each purchase. Data used in this study are readily available for authorities to calculate indirect trading chains of each farm, perhaps to a lesser extent than practiced here, in order to reduce computational time (e.g. up to three movements away from the root farm) and could be then made available to farmers, for example, using an existing application such as the online ibTB tool [38]. Clearly, bTB status is only one of many factors taken into consideration when purchasing stock, if indeed it is considered at all [39]. Focussing solely on sourcing animals based on particular diseases might also unintentionally result in an increased risk of others [40]. Therefore, in addition to bTB specific government controls, holistic measures that reduce the risk of all diseases, such as reducing trade connections and quarantine measures are likely to contribute effectively to herd biosecurity.",

However, unlike the French study, the number of source farms was not associated with a large increase in the risk of experiencing a bTB incident, suggesting that trade in cattle might play a different role in predicting bTB incidents in the two countries. Bovine tuberculosis prevalence is much lower in France than in England and Wales and there is a comparatively low force of infection from the local environment. This likely results in overall trading strategies being more important, relative to the specific identity of trading partners in the movement network. Our analysis in Britain showed that in terms of bTB incident risk, the location of source farms was more important than the total number of source farms. We predicted that trading with farms that had a history of bTB incidents would be a more accurate predictor of risk than trading with farms from the England High-Risk Area, as reported by Green et al. [12]. However, we also found that trading with farms in the England High-Risk Area was more informative in predicting a subsequent bTB incident on the root farm. This may suggest that past bTB incidents do not fully describe bTB risk and that undisclosed infections in herds and/or environmental sources of infection, such as wildlife, present a risk that is captured by being in the England High-Risk Area but not detected through routine testing [41].",

We expected that farms closest (i.e. 0\u20132 km) to the root farm would have the greatest effect on this risk as this would encompass potential contacts of cattle on shared boundaries and the risks from infected local wildlife [42]. However, the variable which best explained this risk was the proportion of farms with a bTB incident within a radius of 8 km. This could potentially be related to the additional effects of unrecorded local cattle movements [12], the spreading of infected slurry [23] and movement of cattle among fragmented land parcels [42]. That this proxy measure still has a large effect size after accounting for other major factors suggests that some or all of these factors may be important drivers of local risk.",

As the environmental force of re-infection in non-endemic areas is likely to be low, this suggests that a small number of herds in Scotland and the England Low-Risk Area may have had OTF status restored without having fully eliminated infection [41], or alternatively, that there is a repeated external source of infection not accounted for in our study. For example, we have not included cattle imports from outside Great Britain and may therefore have underestimated the risk of bTB on farms that import animals from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland [19], where bTB infection is also endemic in cattle.",

Nevertheless, the major risk factors identified in this and previous studies tend to reflect fixed characteristics of farms (location, past disease history) and those that are difficult, costly or slow to change (herd type). By contrast, elements of trading behaviour, and particular purchasing decisions, might be more amenable to modification, through regulation and incentivization with support from industry and policy-makers. Although certain trading behaviours are clearly related to business type (e.g. dairy, fattening, etc.) [4], careful consideration of existing trading behaviours and potential purchases could result in more robust and safer acquisition and sales of livestock. The present study reinforces the importance of direct trading links but highlights the additional risks associated with indirect trading links, revealed by a more thorough examination of the movement network, as necessary factors to consider in strategies to reduce bTB transmission in Great Britain. In the specific context of bTB and trading, raising awareness of trading risks might prompt farmers to seek more information about their potential trading partners and encourage industry and government to facilitate sharing of this kind of data. Given the computational complexities of interrogating such a dense movement network in real time, the next challenge will be in determining how best these sources of risk might be integrated into current management policies and evaluating how farmers might respond to them.",
