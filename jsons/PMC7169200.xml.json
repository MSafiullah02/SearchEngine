During autophagy processing, the level of membrane\u2010associated 16 kDa LC3\u2010II increases, while the level of soluble 18 kDa LC3\u2010I decreases. Thus, the relative amount of LC3\u2010II is linked to the dynamic turnover of LC3\u2010II via the lysosomal activity.33, 34 In this process, LC3\u2010I is covalently conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through LC3 lipid coupling mechanism, resulting in LC3\u2010II.

            "text": "Autophagy is an integral part of immune response to viral infections and plays a key role both in innate and adaptive immunity responses. Autophagy is essential for delivering cytoplasmic viral RNA to the endosomal pathway through unique ability to deliver cytosolic pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns into the closeness of endosomal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and MHC loading compartments. For example, influenza viruses are sensed in the lysosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) through TLR7 after endocytosis of virions.54 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 can escape immune system through a new mechanism in DCs. HIV\u20101 was revealed to block macroautophagy initiation via inducing the mTOR pathway. This suppression resulted in a deficiency of TLR4 and TLR8 activation through viral replication intermediates and of antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. Macroautophagy was presented to be essential for MHC class II antigen processing of a HIV gag\u2010derived CD4+ T cell epitope. HIV gag\u2010specific CD4+ T cell clone significantly decreased TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion upon induction with macroautophagy\u2010deficient DCs, pulsed with inactivated HIV virus. While CD8+ T cell activation was not compromised when macroautophagy was suppressed. This study indicated that efficient HIV antigen processing for MHC class II presentation needs macroautophagy.55, 56 HCV abuses autophagy to inhibit IFN signaling. It also temporally regulates the autophagic flux to sequester and deplete TRAF6 to promote viral RNA replication and control of host innate immune responses.57 It is interesting to note that a paradigm has been appeared in which Th1 cytokines induce autophagy, while, Th2 cytokines suppress autophagy activation.58, 59 In HIV infection, inhibition of autophagy in bystander macrophage/monocytic was dependent on IL\u201010 and Src\u2010Akt and STAT3 triggered by HIV\u20101 Tat.60 Autophagy has been involved in both the delivery of cytosolic antigens to the major histocompatibility complex classes I and II. The HIV envelope proteins are recognized to subvert MHC class II presentation via enhancing mTOR signaling.61 Importantly, immunity\u2010associated GTPase family M(IRGM) IRGM\u2010interacting viral proteins, such as HCV\u2010NS3 and HIV\u20101\u2010Nef, induce autophagy in an IRGM\u2010dependent pathway in order to improve viral infectivity.62 The result of recent study suggests that efficient cross\u2010presentation of viral antigens needed macroautophagy in antigen donor cells. To assess cross\u2010presentation via macroautophagy wild\u2010type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Bax/Bak\u2212/\u2212 MEFs cells were applied. While wild\u2010type MEFs can complete caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis, Bax/Bak\u2212/\u2212 MEFs cannot undergo this type of cell death but can upregulate macroautophagy under the treatment conditions. Both cells were infected with influenza A virus, then treated with pro\u2010apoptotic compounds and subsequently transferred in vivo to prime experiment. Mice immunized with Bax/Bak\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressed a significantly higher CD8+ T cell response specific to both immunodominant of influenza haemagglutinin and neucleoprotein.63 Last but not least, autophagy hijacked by nonstructural protein 4 viroporin\u2010activated calcium/calmodulin\u2010dependent kinase kinase\u2010\u03b2 signaling is indispensable for rotavirus replication.64\n",

The accumulation of mis\u2010folded or unfolded protein in the ER causes ER stress which in turn results in the activation of 3 distinct pathways: the inositol\u2010requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and double\u2010stranded (ds) RNA\u2010activated protein kinase, including ER kinase (PERK). These proteins trigger downstream signaling pathways to cope with mis\u2010folded proteins.73 This process, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), alleviates ER stress by reducing protein synthesis, upregulating ER chaperone protein expression to facilitate protein folding, and augmenting protein degradation via autophagy and the ER\u2010associated degradation pathway. If the UPR fails to alleviate ER stress, it will induce apoptosis.73, 74 In addition, ER stress releases calcium from the ER resulting in an increase of mitochondrial metabolic activity. This activity leads to an overproduction of ROS, which leads to mitochondrial oxidative. Damaged mitochondria are then selectively targeted for degradation by mitophagy via activation of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin\u2010related protein\u20101; this process is reported to occur during HCV infection.75 HCV upregulates expression levels of serine/threonine kinase PTEN\u2010induced putative kinase 1 and Parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), both of which then translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane. The new Parkin on the mitochondrial surface recruits its substrate to induce mitophagy.76 HCV\u2010activated mitophagy could decrease HCV\u2010induced apoptosis in order to promote viral persistence.77 The HCV core protein has been revealed to stimulate both the ATF6 and PERK pathways that, in turn, enhance the expression of the ATG12 and LC3 genes.78 Induction of autophagy and mitophagy is essential to sustain the survival of infected cells and establish a chronic HCV infection.77\n",

Previously, it was hypothesized that M2 protein causes this accumulation by preventing autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, and that the proton channel activity of M2 is involved in this blocking activity. In fact, Gannage et al showed that M2 proton channel activity is not involved in blocking autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. They verified this result by using amantadine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of M2 ion channel activity, which was unable to prevent autophagosome accumulation in IAV\u2010infected cells. Finally, they showed that the N\u2010terminal domain of M2 blocks autolysosome formation and acts independently of its proton channel function.160, 185, 186\n",

It has been shown that membrane\u2010associated papain\u2010like protease PLP2 (PLP2\u2010TM) of SARS\u2010CoV is an autophagy\u2010inducing protein. PLP2\u2010TM induces the accumulation of autophagosomes and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Furthermore, PLP2\u2010TM interacts with the key autophagy regulators, LC3 and Beclin 1, and promotes Beclin 1 interaction with STING, the key regulator for antiviral IFN signaling.188 Coronavirus NSP6 proteins limit autophagosome expansion to remove host proteins that would inhibit replication. This may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation.189 As evidenced by the large quantity of information gathered here, the relationship between viruses and autophagy is complex,190 and fundamental mechanisms of autophagy involvement in viral infection are still in being elucidated.",

After HCV decapsidation, the virus genome is transferred to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates replication in the ER\u2010derived membranous web as the HCV replication platform. HCV\u2010induced ER stress disrupts ER function and results in accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Cells adapt to ER stress by triggering an unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore ER homeostasis. The UPR signaling pathway includes 3 central elements, PKR\u2010like ER kinase (PERK), ATF6, and IRE1. The UPR could stimulate an autophagy response. Under these conditions, calcium released from the ER stimulates impaired mitochondrial activity connect to excessive production of ROS. Dysfunctional mitochondria are engulfed for degradation via mitophagy. In addition, HCV promoted dynamin\u2010related protein 1\u2010mediated mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Drp1) leads to mitophagy. HCV replication takes place in close proximity to lipid droplets (LDs), the neutral lipid storage organelles, and this closeness enables the downstream viral morphogenetic events. A selective autophagy for lipids (lipophagy) protects cells from an excessive lipid accumulation elicited by HCV. Upon HCV infection, the host stimulates the antiviral interferon\u2010mediated frontline. HCV employs autophagy to escape host innate immune surveillance by inhibiting IFN\u03b1 production. Furthermore, HCV replication reduced ribavirin uptake, due to reduced expression of the nucleoside transporters ENT1 and CNT1",
