Events such as the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza, Rift valley fever, foot and mouth disease and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in Europe and, recently, Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa are just a few examples [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . There are multiple causes of these epidemics, including factors such as increased population mobility, trade globalization and climate change potentially affecting the geographical distribution of viral vectors [7, 8] . The potential for bioterrorism through the deliberate release of an infectious agent in an area not previously affected has been raised and adds a further dimension to the emergence of infectious disease and its control. Zoonotic diseases caused by microorganisms whose principal reservoirs are wild and domestic animals are a leading cause of death and disease. In the past 60 years, more than 50% of emerging infectious diseases in humans have originated from zoonoses [9] . The zoonotic infection arena contains several billion humans, a growing number of domestic animals and many wild animals and vectors, which contribute to a large number of interactions between different players and zoonotic infections. Complex interactions between epidemiological, ecological and social processes will promote the emergence and transmission of zoonotic diseases. The latest outbreak of EVD highlights the complexity of the interface between the elements mentioned above for zoonotic diseases. In this review, several crucial questions raised during the current outbreak will be discussed, such as: why EVD outbreaks occur in West Africa, far away from the endemic area; why this outbreak has occurred now; and which factors have contributed to the current widespread transmission of EVD, in contrast to all previous known outbreaks. In addition, the most promising candidate treatments will be summarized.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 425, "end": 428, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 433, "end": 436, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 437, "end": 440, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 441, "end": 444, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 658, "end": 661, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 662, "end": 664, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1141, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The Filoviridae family belongs to the order Mononegavirales, but its members are significantly separated from other Mononegavirales on the basis of physiochemical, morphological, biological features and genomic structure [10] . Members of the Filoviridae are nonsegmented, RNA viruses with negative polarity [10] . These viruses are filamentous (as indicated by their name, derived from the Latin filum meaning 'thread'). They form a thread-like shape, with a uniform diameter of about 80 nm [11] and a typical length of about 1200 nm [12, 13] . [14] [15] [16] . Of interest, this is in contrast to the known diversity for EBOV species, with a nucleotide difference between sequences of only 2.7%, 5.2% and 4.5% for EBOV, Sudan Ebola virus and Reston Ebola virus, respectively [16, 17] . Classification of the Filoviridae family will most probably continue to develop as further information becomes available through genome sequencing. Phylogenetic studies have been applied to estimate the age of filoviruses. The estimates of common ancestor age range from thousands to millions of years [18, 19] , which indicates that these studies should be repeated using novel techniques and increased sample size to obtain more consistent estimates of the age of filoviruses. Recent studies of almost 100 whole-genome sequences using Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses indicate nucleotide substitutions/ site/year for different viruses ranging from 0. 46 [20] : nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein (GP), RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the structural proteins virus protein (VP)24, VP30, VP35 and VP40. In addition, EBOV is able to express a truncated soluble GP through RNA editing and small soluble GP, which are secreted from the host cell [20, 21] . The surfaces of the viral membranes are spiked with GP trimers. These trimers are formed from GP1 and GP2 (product of cleavage of precursor GP). The GP trimers mediate receptor binding and are the target for neutralizing antibodies. GP spikes, which embed on the virion surface, mediate virus entry [22, 23] . GP1 contains an excessively O-linked glycosylated mucin-like domain and a heavily N-linked glycosylated glycan cap domain, and these exterior domains are responsible for binding to a variety of host cell surface factors, as well as covering the receptorbinding domain under them [24] . NP and VP30 are required for RNA encapsidation [25, 26] . However, it has also been suggested that VP30 may act as a viral transcription activator [27, 28] . VP35 links NPs with the viral RdRP to construct the viral RNA synthesis complex for transcription and genome replication [29] . The VP35 protein is also known to interfere with interferon induction in both Marburg virus and EBOV [30, 31] . The matrix proteins VP40 and VP24 play essential roles in later steps of the replication cycle, such as assembly and budding [32] [33] [34] . VP 24 may also act as an interferon antagonist [35, 36] . It has been demonstrated that different forms of Ebola GPs can be released from infected cells and that these secreted GPs may activate noninfected dendritic cells and macrophages, causing massive release of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines and thereby affecting vascular permeability [37] . These GPs thus contribute to high virus pathogenicity. As mentioned above, EBOV is also able to express a truncated soluble GP, which contributes to a mechanism of host immune system evasion through absorption of antibodies and interference with antibodymediated clearance [21, [38] [39] [40] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 225, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 546, "end": 550, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 551, "end": 555, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 777, "end": 781, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 782, "end": 785, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1094, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1098, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1457, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1749, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1753, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2063, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2349, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2403, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2404, "end": 2407, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2499, "end": 2503, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2507, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2635, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2739, "end": 2743, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2744, "end": 2747, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2875, "end": 2879, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2880, "end": 2884, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2885, "end": 2889, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2939, "end": 2943, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2944, "end": 2947, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3237, "end": 3241, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3517, "end": 3521, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3526, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3527, "end": 3531, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3532, "end": 3536, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Filoviridae"}, {"text": "Ebola virus disease was first described in 1976 in Zaire [now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)].

In August 2014, the largest, most sustained and most widespread EVD outbreak in history became apparent and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO was notified of the outbreak in March 2014 [45] , after a febrile illness cluster with high case fatality rate in the area of Gueckedou, Guinea.

His case became the starting point source for person-to-person spread of EVD into the population in several West African countries. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been most affected, and these countries continue to report new cases.

However, the exact number of cases is difficult to determine, and the magnitude of the outbreak is believed to have been significantly under estimated. One case in Senegal was a traveller from Guinea, and a small number of cases in Nigeria and Mali originated from Liberia and Guinea, respectively.

More recent experiments have shown that inhalation of less than 10 infectious particles of EBOV is sufficient to cause lethal disease in NHPs [59] . However, it is important to note that these studies do not address the question of whether EBOV is aerosolized naturally. Direct contact with body fluids from patients with EVD is the most likely way of transmitting EBOV. The evidence from previous and current outbreaks, epidemiological data and animal experiments all clearly demonstrate that contact with EBOV-infected fluids can lead to infection. Despite strong evidence to suggest that contact with body fluids is the route of EBOV transmission, it remains unclear when (i.e. how long postdisease onset) and which (e.g. sweat and tears) fluids contain infectious virus. In previous studies, EBOV has been isolated from blood, Very recent data from a 36-year-old male patient (treated in Hamburg, Germany) demonstrated high levels of viral RNA in plasma until 2 weeks after disease onset; RNA was also been detected in sweat until 40 days postdisease onset, whilst the level of viral RNA decreased below the detection level in urine at 31 days postonset [61] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 282, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 427, "end": 431, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1447, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical symptoms, transmission and infection control measures"}, {"text": "As described above, EBOV is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person and by contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment; therefore, patients with suspected or confirmed EVD should be isolated either in a isolation/specific room or a restricted area.

It has been suggested that EBOV could have been circulating in West Africa for about a decade [49] , which raises the question of why there is an EVD outbreak in West Africa now. Another pressing issue concerns the factors that contributed to the current widespread transmission of EVD, in contrast to all previous known outbreaks which were limited in scope. The huge EVD epidemic in West Africa presents unique challenges because of spread into crowded urban environments and occurrence in remote communities. One year after the first case of EVD in Guinea, it can be concluded that health teams at urban, county and district levels, particularly in rural counties with remote regions, need adequate training in: (i) case reporting, investigation and management, (ii) contact tracing, (iii) safe burial, and (iv) safe sample collection, processing and transport for diagnostic testing. Control of the epidemic is much more challenging in rural counties, as there are few roads, most of which are in poor condition, an overall lack of vehicles, no internet connectivity and limited telephone network coverage. Therefore, the development of novel communication and transportation network strategies for these remote communities is critical for management of EVD in such areas.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 388, "end": 392, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Factors contributing to the magnitude of the current EVD outbreak"}, {"text": "In general, the following three elements can be cited as crucial factors contributing to the current substantial and widespread outbreak in West Africa (Fig. 3) : (i) delays in outbreak detection, (ii) lack of public health infrastructure, and (iii) sociocultural factors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 160, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Factors contributing to the magnitude of the current EVD outbreak"}, {"text": "The suspected index case in the current outbreak, the 2-year-old boy in Guinea, contracted the disease and died at the end of 2013 [46] .

A number of factors impede the early identification of EVD outbreaks in Africa in general and in West Africa in particular. First, only a very few EVD outbreaks have occurred in Africa (East and Central Africa) since the first outbreak was identified in 1976, so awareness of the disease tends to be low. In addition, some areas at risk of EVD have not yet experienced an outbreak, which has strongly limited community-level knowledge of the disease [63] . Secondly, the early symptoms of EVD are nonspecific [64] , which increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis. Thirdly, there is a lack of diagnostic testing in low-income countries.

The associated potential for transmission to neighbouring and distant areas via exposed funeral attendants can facilitate the development of major epidemics [66] . Moreover, the lack of prior experience and knowledge of the disease can lead communities to deny its existence and to associate illness with witchcraft or an alleged government conspiracy to gain control of the population or attract resources from the international community [67] . For instance, during the ongoing epidemic in West Africa, a group of individuals looted equipment and potentially contaminated materials from an isolation facility in a quarantined neighbourhood. Finally, the stigma carried by EVD survivors and the family members of EVD victims could exacerbate disease spread. In particular, uninformed families tend to hide relatives and friends infected with EVD, to avoid being shunned by their own communities, which enhances transmission rates.
