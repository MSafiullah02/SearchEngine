Furthermore, animal model data in diabetic mice indicate that ACE-2 activity may be increased in the pancreas [9] . Thus, it is not surprising that ACE-2 overexpression is further explored as a risk factor for COVID-19 [10] . This potentially places patients with diabetes at additional risk of worsening hyperglycemia in case of a SARS-CoV2 infection, and further supports the clinical evidence that T2DM constitutes a crucial risk factor for rapid deterioration and worse prognosis of COVID-19 [11] .",

In this paper, Rogers et al. propose a Pandemic Diabetic Foot Triage System, in-home visits, higher acuity office visits, and telemedicine/remote patient monitoring in order for podiatrists to effectively manage patients with diabetic foot disease during the COVID-19 outbreak and reduce the relevant burden on healthcare services by keeping these high risk patients functional, safe and, where possible, at home [15] . Overall, despite this disrupting pandemic, the appropriate use of both oral and injectable antidiabetic medications to control hyperglycemia should not be overlooked, since this has been and should remain at the heart of preventing and reducing risks related to diabetes, including diabetic foot disease [14] [15] [16] . This is also highlighted in another paper published in the Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications by Cushscieri & Greech which outlines how hyperglycemia may have a likely negative impact in the context of COVID-19, including suppression of the antiviral response, pulmonary structure changes and historic evidence of increased viral infection in hyperglycemia [17] . Therefore, the proper use of diabetes medications is also essential in managing the risk of COVID-19 to patients with diabetes. Interestingly, the most commonly prescribed medication in diabetes care, i.e. metformin, was in fact initially used as a drug for patients with influenza and malaria [18] , and has been postulated to have the potential to not only prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the ACE-2 pathway, but also prevent detrimental sequelae by causing activation of ACE-2 through AMPK-signaling [19] .",

Indeed, metformin itself can contribute to lactic acidosis as a consequence of severe dehydration in COVID-19 patients, so such patients should stop metformin and follow sick day rules [12, 13] . Similarly, there is a risk of both dehydration and diabetic ketoacidosis with the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which should be stopped in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes [12, 13] . On the other hand, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors appear to be generally well-tolerated and can be continued, whilst insulin treatment should not be discontinued [12, 13] . Finally, it is noteworthy that other medications which are also commonly prescribed in patients with diabetes are currently under the spotlight regarding their potential impact on COVID-19 and its complications.
