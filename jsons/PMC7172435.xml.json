            "text": "Spontaneous cell fusion among animal cells occurs during certain stages of the developmental program, like in the case of the generation of muscle fibers by myoblast fusion. Otherwise, cells in tissues do not fuse in spite of close contacts between them. There are two main reasons for the absence of cell fusion in tissues. First, the external matrix of the cells constitutes a physical obstacle to the fusion. Second, the structure of the lipid bilayers, with external hydrophilic layers at both sides of the internal hydrophobic core, prevents the spontaneous fusion of intact lipid bilayers. However, fusion between the plasma membrane and the membrane of cell internal vesicles, as well as fusion between membranes of different internal vesicles, or fission (e.g., at Golgi tubular networks), constantly occur in the living eucaryotic cells. Indeed, fusion and fission sustain membrane traffic, endocytosis and exocytosis, as well as intracellular transport in general. The mechanisms underlying the \u2018internal\u2019 fusions and fissions are still under analysis: vesicle fusion occurs mainly on the basis of SNAREs proteins interactions [1], but other proteins, like the SM proteins or the Rab proteins might also be involved (reviewed in [2]). These proteins can also directly contribute to membrane fusion [1], like the spike protein of murine coronaviruses [3] or other viral proteins [2]. In spite of rapid accumulation of new results, the membrane fusion mechanisms are not yet fully described. Recently the role of the lipids has been pointed out because membrane fission of Golgi tubular networks has been shown to depend also on the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid by specific proteins [4]. However, the mechanisms underlying the fusion of intact plasma membranes of two different cells, like in the case of the myoblast, are still unknown at the molecular level.",

This last approach, termed electrofusion, is based on cell electropermeabilization [7] (also termed electroporation), which is caused by the increase in transmembrane potential imposed by the application to the cells of external electric fields [8]. Reversible cell electropermeabilization corresponds to the transient and reversible modification of the plasma membrane structure [9]. In vitro, this modification has several biological consequences as well as some biotechnological and biomedical applications [10], [11]: (i) increase of membrane permeability to non-permeant or low-permeant molecules, (ii) electroinsertion into the membrane of proteins possessing transmembrane domains, or (iii) electrofusion of cells.",

On the contrary, in electrically treated tumors, 70 h after the delivery of permeabilizing EP, completely different patterns could be detected (Fig. 1C\u2013H). The nuclei were reassembled in a common cytoplasm forming polynuclear giant cells. These giant cells contained several nuclei in close contact (a maximum of 64 nuclei was counted in one case, see Fig. 1H), organized in two different categories: (i) patterns with a large cytoplasm and a peripheral ring of multiple nuclei; (ii) patterns with multiple nuclei arranged randomly in the center. At 70 h after EP delivery (1350 V/cm), 4.8% of the nuclei (observed randomly as described in Section 2) were included in giant cells containing more than one nucleus. This was in clear contrast with the situation observed in the control tumors removed from the mice either at the time of the treatment of the treated tumors or 70 h later. Indeed in each of these control situations, out of the 1700 cells counted, no cell was found to contain more than one nucleus.

The LPB tumors were exposed to the same EP (same voltage to distance ratio, number of pulses, duration of each pulse and frequency of repetition, as well as identical electrode geometry) as those delivered to the B16 tumors. It was shown that these EP really permeabilized the LPB tumor cells, using bleomycin at a high dose as described above (Fig. 7B). Nevertheless, the electropermeabilizing EP did not result in the appearance of any of the particular figures observed in the B16 tumor slices. Indeed, panels C and D in Fig. 7 show that there were no morphological changes under the same conditions that lead to extensive electrofusion in B16 tumors. In order to be sure that the absence of cell electrofusion was not the result of a limited cell permeabilization (see above), higher voltages (2000 V/cm) were also delivered to the LPB fibrosarcomas. Even under these drastic permeabilization conditions, no electrofusion event was detected (Fig. 7E,F).",

In parallel, fusion was detected in almost all the sections (16 out of 18 sections examined at 15 h after EP delivery). Previous experiments have also shown that the B16 tumors were only weakly affected by bleomycin when pulses of an amplitude of 500 V/cm were used. Thus we were expecting that only few cells were permeabilized at this low amplitude, instead of a large majority of the cells at 1350 V/cm. We confirmed this situation using the permeabilization test based on the effects of high doses of bleomycin on the electropermeabilized cells. In agreement with the non-homogeneity of the electric field distribution when plate electrodes are applied over a more or less spherical tumor (the highest amplitude of local electric amplitudes being found the closest to the electrodes, model not shown), permeabilization was observed only in restricted areas. In parallel, at 500 V/cm, patterns revealing cell electrofusion in B16 tumors (Fig. 6) were not detected on the whole of the tumors sections, but only in defined regions that could correspond to the parts of the tumors which were permeabilized. Thus, in combination with the facts that (i) the number of nuclei per giant cell at 15 h using pulses of 500 V/cm was just one fourth of the number of nuclei detected using pulses of 1350 V/cm, and that (ii) syncytial areas were not detected at 500 V/cm, it can be concluded that, as expected from the theory and the in vitro results, extent of in vivo electrofusion seems to be closely related to the extent of cell electropermeabilization.",

At that time, no change in nuclei distribution in the overall B16 tissue was detectable. Later on, nuclei distribution in the tissue changed, separation between the cells became clear, and it was possible to detect typical giant cells similar to those obtained after cell fusion in vitro [37]. The nuclei were either all located in one group in the center of the cell, or located at the cell periphery, forming a circular pearl chain around the center of the cell. In both cases, the stain of the cytoplasm was more homogeneous and intense. The first signs of nuclei redistribution were observed at 3 h after EP delivery. Ten hours after EP, the morphological changes were completed. These morphological changes thus occurred very slowly with respect to the initial membrane perturbation, like in vitro, where it was shown that the completion of the process requires several hours and corresponds to large rearrangements of the cytoskeleton [21].",

Metastatic potential is related to proteases secretion in the environment, that facilitates the escaping of the tumor cells from the original nodule, their migration and their spreading, and that allows tumor cells invasion of new tissues through the dissociation of normal tissue structure. It is important to note that, contrary to B16 tumors, the LPB tumors do not generate metastases (unpublished data).\u2022On the other hand, cell treatment by trypsin (5 or 10 min at 37\u00b0C and 1 mg/ml) or pronase (5 min at 21\u00b0C or 10 min at 37\u00b0C and 20 \u03bcg/ml) resulted in a net increase of fusion yields in plated CHO cells in vitro [41]. Dispase, pronase and trypsin also facilitated the fusion of cells in suspension [42]. More recently, it has also been reported that addition of pepsin, pronase E or lysozyme leads to an increase in yields of electropermeabilization and electrofusion in U937 cells in vitro [43].

The absence of extracellular matrix as a factor allowing for in vitro cell\u2013cell electrofusion was already pointed out previously in experiments in vitro [45].",

B16 cells in control tumors not exposed to the electric pulses constitute a tissue rapidly renewing the cells that presents a level of mitoses of 4%, as well as a level of spontaneous cell death by apoptosis of 3% (H. Mekid et al., unpublished data). Fusion of cells in vivo does not seem to interfere with the entry of giant cells into mitosis. However, as one could expect, these multinucleated cells present aberrant mitotic patterns (Fig. 5). The (pseudo)normal mitotic patterns observed in the small multinucleated cells can explain the persistence of multinucleated cells even at 100 h after EP delivery, while the decrease in the percentage of both the number of giant cells and the number of nuclei per giant cell after the peaks observed at 15 h could result from the cell death in the large multinucleated cells illustrated by Fig. 5.",

Particular microenvironmental conditions, like the existence of reduced extracellular matrices because of the presence of high levels of proteases in the interstitial medium, could be responsible for electrofusion in these tissues. Therefore, in the rapidly developing biomedical applications of in vivo electropermeabilization, some attention must be paid to the potential occurrence of cell electrofusion in the target tissue.",

On the other hand, the possible link between ability to metastasize and electrofusogeneity could have interesting implications in cancer treatment. Indeed, electric pulses are already used in electrochemotherapy to efficiently introduce hydrophilic cytotoxic drugs (such as bleomycin or cisplatinum) into the tumor cells. If the cells with the highest metastatic potential in the tumor cell population are fused inside the tumor, then their spreading could be reduced. Obviously, these giant cells should be subject to cell death because their electropermeabilization, which generated their fusion, should also permit cytotoxic drug uptake. However, in the case of a non-homogeneous distribution of the cytotoxic drug, or of an insufficient local supply, cell death could also occur in the cells not loaded with the drug, because, as shown here, mitoses in giant cells are altered and the death of cells in syncytial areas is triggered even in absence of cytotoxic drugs. Thus, cell electrofusion could be an important advantage of the in vivo delivery of EP to metastasizing tumors.",
