As of March 31, the New York State Department of Health mandated that health care personnel with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection quarantines themselves for 7 days after illness onset and remains fever-free for at least 72 hours before returning to work.24 Asymptomatic but tested positive health care personnel must also quarantine for at least 7 days from the date of the test. After returning to work, these personnel were expected to wear a facemask for at least 14 days after symptoms onset. Given these instructions to limit COVID-19 transmission, the loss of 1 or 2 resident physicians to home quarantine could have been considered a hardship for any hospital department. Missing over 10 resident physicians would have been a disaster. Indeed, by March 24, 17 (24%) of the 72 resident physicians in the Internal Medicine department at JHMC were on home quarantine from COVID-19. Because of this personnel shortage, hospital leadership began soliciting other departments for assistance with caring for the surge in patients infected with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The JHMC Orthopedic Surgery department was in a unique position to alleviate the physician shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because elective cases had been postponed to limit patient exposure to COVID-19 and a lower volume of patients with traumatic musculoskeletal injuries were presenting to the hospital, likely secondary to the Governor's recommendations for people to remain home, the Orthopedic Surgery department had the resources and flexibility to be repurposed into other roles at JHMC. One option was that an Orthopedic Surgery attending could staff musculoskeletal issues presenting to the emergency department to free up emergency department physicians to care for other patients. However, in most cases, these patients were already being evaluated by a physician assistant and either being redirected to clinic at a later date for nonurgent complaints or the orthopedic surgery resident on call was being consulted for assistance with any fractures or urgent complaints. A second option was that the Orthopedic Surgery department could begin conducting in-person or telehealth visits for patients with chronic medical conditions and assist with symptom evaluation or medication refills. This plan would allow the internal medicine and family medicine physicians to transition to solely inpatient care for COVID-19 patients. However, further discussions revealed that the orthopedic surgery physicians would not have the available staff to relieve all the clinics, and it would not be efficient to filter out the patients with more straight-forward issues. Finally, the department could assume the responsibility of inpatient evaluation, treatment, and disposition of COVID-19 patients. These patients could be easily incorporated into morning rounds with the orthopedic surgery team, and because each patient had a similar chief complaint, their care could follow algorithm-based medicine. Furthermore, any emergency with a COVID-19 patient could be addressed by an orthopedic surgery team member as both the COVID-19 patients and musculoskeletal injury patients were located in the same hospital building. The Orthopedic Surgery department adopted care for 15 inpatients (with an expected maximum of 20 patients) undergoing treatment for infection with COVID-19 on April 4.",

The orthopedic surgery team was kept intact to allow for an efficient workflow in caring for both orthopedic surgery patients and internal medicine patients. Furthermore, keeping the team together built camaraderie and limited disturbances to the familiar culture that would have occurred if unfamiliar team members had been introduced or if orthopedic surgery residents had been removed to other services. Maintaining the orthopedic surgery team structure allowed for continuation of a well-understood hierarchical chain of command that maximized efficiency and safety. The team has been able to maintain safety and prevent infection of members of the team through a team-based approach of monitoring the donning and doffing of personal protect equipment (PPE) as well as the appropriate use of the PPE (disposable gown and gloves, N95 mask, and face shield). Cross-contamination between the multiple hospitals within the NYU Langone Health\u2013affiliated network was limited by keeping the orthopedic surgery team members solely at JHMC and recommending against contact with resident physicians at other hospitals. Residents continued their orthopedic educational experience through residency-wide educational conferences held over video conferences with the team calling-in from the JHMC orthopedic surgery workroom.",

Most patients who were assigned to the Ortho-COVID-19 management team were patients in the mild to moderate severity class.

While continuously evolving, the general progression for increasing oxygen requirements was from nasal cannula to venturi mask, to nonrebreather mask, to high-flow nasal cannula, to BiPAP and finally intubation. Patient oxygen saturations were consistently monitored and if a patient had an oxygen saturation less than 92% on the maximum level of the given oxygen supplementation device, then he or she was escalated to the next level of oxygen supplementation. With the understanding that little is known about optimal antibiotic and antiviral therapy for treating COVID-19, the hospital-wide policy was to start patients on hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or doxycycline and daily EKGs. Any concerns of QTc prolongation resulted in patients being switched to darunavir\u2013cobicistat combination pills and PEG interferon. Any pharmacologic escalation was made with input from infectious disease consults. The infectious disease consults were managed by the same team that routinely cares for orthopedic patients with infectious processes.",

A family medicine or internal medicine attending was at the top of the hierarchy and acted as the point of contact if the orthopedic surgery team encountered complex medical questions (Fig. 1). Each rounding team functioned with an orthopedic surgery attending at its head to split the floor of up to 20 patients. The goals of the rounding teams were to evaluate patients for any acute issues, identify patients with worsening clinical status to escalate oxygen requirement, and wean oxygen supplementation in stable patients to move these individuals closer to discharge from the hospital. Because oxygen adjustments often required several minutes of monitoring with a pulse oximeter to ensure that the algorithm policies were being met, members of the rounding team were assigned specific roles to expedite morning rounds in what we have termed the \u201cAgriculture Model\u201d:Sower: a junior resident who would work several rooms ahead of the \u201creaper team\u201d with a portable pulse oximeter and record the current oxygen supplementation level and oxygen saturation on the patient's board. They would then begin the oxygen requirement challenge by turning down the patient's oxygen flow rate, ensure that no rapid decompensation would occur, mark the new oxygen flow rate on the patient's white board, then move on to the next patient's room (Figs. 2 and 3A, D).Reaper team: a chief resident along with a junior resident who would follow the \u201csower\u201d by a few minutes to recheck the new oxygen saturation and titrate the oxygen requirement up as needed. Upon confirming that a patient's oxygen levels had stabilized, these team members would report to the \u201cfarm\u201d (Figs. 3B, D).Farm: a junior resident (Farmer) with a portable electronic medical record workstation [computer-on-wheels (COW)] that remained outside of patients' rooms. This resident would record new oxygen requirements for patients, make any notable updates, and write the progress note (Figs. 3C, D).",

After rounding as a team in the morning, the COVID-19 patients were discussed with the family medicine or internal medicine attending to identify patients requiring close monitoring. Similarly, any patients with progressively complex medications were re-evaluated by the head medical attending in the morning with escalation of care as necessary. As an example, one of our COVID-19 patients suffered deterioration of his mental status over several days with a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels and increasing supplemental oxygenation requirements (Hospital day 5, hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL, oxygen saturation 84% on max flow using nonrebreather mask). Frequent and direct conversations about this patient were held with the family medicine attending and the family medicine attending facilitated his transfer to an intensive care unit. This constant line of communication ensured appropriate care for the COVID-19 patients covered by orthopedic surgery.",

Each morning, the overnight consult resident would collect a set of fresh PPE for the entire team from the JHMC storeroom. Team members were provided with an extrasurgical mask, gowns, protective eye equipment, head protection, and gloves in the call room before rounds would start. PPE was donned in the call room together as a team. As N95 masks were in short supply, each team member received new N95 masks at the beginning of each week, which they would keep in a brown paper bag when not being actively used. The attending and chief residents confirmed that each member of the team had proper PPE in place before leaving the room to round. Between each patient contact, members of the team would double glove and replace the outer glove before coming in contact with the next patient. Hand sanitizer was applied to the inner glove before application of the second layer glove. Doffing of PPE would occur after medicine rounds concluded and would be performed at the exit of the COVID isolation unit. Gowns, outer surgical masks, face shields, gloves, and head gear were discarded before returning to the workroom.",

A high level of group cohesion allows the unit the best chance of survival and improves performance. Changes in organizational structure and disturbing social relationships decreases team cohesion and can lead to lapses in safety and efficiency.26 Keeping the orthopedic surgery team as a single unit for both orthopedic and COVID-19 care allowed the team practice, these techniques maintain resilience despite working in a new environment.",

Although the internal medicine teams required assistance with managing the COVID-19 patients, the Orthopedic Surgery department was still expected to manage patients arriving to the hospital with emergent musculoskeletal injuries. We believe that developing our workflow around efficient and safe patient care allowed us achieve this goal. Through the aforementioned daily rounding plans, we were able to reach the operating rooms by 8:30 am and complete at least 2 emergent orthopedic cases per day. On many days, not completing more than 2 cases was due primarily to the limited number of patients presenting to the hospital with musculoskeletal injuries rather than personnel or time constraints.
