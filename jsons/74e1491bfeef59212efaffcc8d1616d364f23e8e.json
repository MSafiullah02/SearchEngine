Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, viruses (rhinoviruses, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus), Gramnegative pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and, in recent years, atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae) have all been reported in investigations of AECB. [3] The three bacterial pathogens, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, were estimated to account for 70% of all episodes of AECB in one report. [4] Other Gram-negative pathogens are recovered less commonly from bronchial secretions of patients with mild to moderate lung dysfunction and AECB; however, these organisms indicate particularly severe impairment of lung function, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) values \u226435% of predicted. [5, 6] Viral causes of AECB have been estimated to cause up to 30% of exacerbations. [7] The common pathway for viral pathogenesis is to disrupt respiratory mucal defenses, allowing bacteria to attach to damaged epithelial cells in patients with AECB. [8] Chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been shown to occur in patients with COPD. In one report where C. pneumoniae was determined by two of three methods (namely serum antibodies to C. pneumoniae, sputum immunoglobulin A antibodies to C. pneumoniae and polymerase chain reaction of sputum for C. pneumoniae DNA), the incidence was 71% in severe COPD and 46% in mild to moderate COPD. [9] Finally, other atypical bacteria can precipitate up to 10% of bronchial exacerbations. [10] ",

            "text": "Current questions regarding the use of antibacterials for the treatment of AECB are whether all AECB are pathophysiologically similar to each other, and whether antibacterials used to treat AECB can prevent hospitalization and its associated morbidity and mortality? Furthermore, in patients that require hospitalization for their AECB treatment, is this because of patient-specific variables or an antibacterial-resistant pathogen? A vicious cycle of infection, inflammation and injury promoting further infection has been proposed, but the contribution of repeated episodes of infection to the progressive loss of lung function remains controversial. [11, 12] The use of antibacterials in the treatment of AECB has been under considerable debate since the early 1970s. Some placebocontrolled antibacterial trials for this condition have shown no positive results for antibacterials and some have shown moderate results in favor of antibacterials. [13] Certainly, economic variables enter into the decision-making process when selecting an antibacterial for AECB. As discussed by other investigators, the use of older agents -which have low per-dose costs -may in turn increase the total costs of treating this condition because of more office visits, noncompliance, treatment failure and adverse events. [14, 15] In 1987, a landmark study was reported by Anthonisen et al. [16] In this study, patients with a diagnosis of AECB and COPD were randomized to antibacterial therapy or placebo for the treatment of their chronic bronchitis exacerbation. Upon subsequent exacerbations, patients enrolled in this study were crossed over to the other arm of the study. The antibacterials used in this trial included cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), amoxicillin (amoxycillin) or doxycycline in standard doses. Patients were stratified in the study by severity of exacerbation based on clinical criteria. The results demonstrated that the success rate in antibacterial-treated exacerbations was 1.24 times higher than in the placebo-treated arm. Of importance from an outcome standpoint, 34% of placebo-treated patients experienced deterioration of their condition compared with 18% in the antibacterial-treated arm. Additionally, differences in the success rate between the antibacterial arm and the placebo arm were greatest in patients with the most severe disease (type I or II) and deterioration was more than twice as much with placebo compared with antibacterials. The authors present their interpretation of the study results and a comparison with previously published AECB antibacterial trial results. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In 1995, Saint et al. [13] published the results of a meta-analysis of nine randomized, placebo-controlled antibacterial trials that demonstrated a small statistically significant benefit with the use of antibacterials in the treatment of AECB. Currently, there are numerous antibacterials that are approved for the treatment of AECB.",

            "text": "Subsequent to the Destache et al. study, [24] Grossman [26] published a review of the treatment of AECB. In the article, he presented evidence that treatment success or failure may be based on specific patient variables. Patient-specific variables that have been identified include cardiopulmonary disease and the number of exacerbations/year. The cardiopulmonary diseases of importance include right-or left-sided heart failure. It appears from other studies, that patients with four or more exacerbations/year may be at risk of antibacterial failure and may require a third-line antibacterial, namely azithromycin, amoxicillin clavulanic acid or ciprofloxacin. [27, 28] Additionally, there are identified risk factors that place a patient at increased risk of hospitalization during an acute exacerbation, e.g. age \u226565 years. Finally, significantly compromised lung function and severe nonpulmonary dysfunction places a patient at increased risk for hospitalization. [5, 6] In his article, Grossman [26] offered a proposed classification of patients and suggested treatment options for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. However, it is important to realize that none of the patient-specific factors have been prospectively determined to present an increased risk of antibacterial failure or prevent hospitalization. Indeed patients with the most severe exacerbations (type I from Anthonison et al. [16] ) were more likely to experience a benefit from antibacterials compared with patients with less severe exacerbations. [29] Additionally, no study to date has documented whether the risk of hospitalization is related to the prevalence of a resistant pathogen. This needs to be determined, as it will have a major impact on the prescription of more costly antibacterials for patients that have severe lung dysfunction and are \u226565 years.",

[30] presented an abstract comparing gemifloxacin, a new investigational quinolone, with clarithromycin. This study was a double-blind, randomized trial in patients with AECB who were followed for 26 weeks after enrollment. Patients who received gemifloxacin for AECB treatment had significantly fewer relapses compared with patients who received clarithromycin (71% success compared with 59%, p < 0.02). Additionally, 5 of 214 gemifloxacin recipients compared with 14 of 224 clarithromycin recipients required hospitalization (p = 0.059). Differences between the treatment groups may have been related to the isolation of Haemophilus influenzae; more study is necessary to confirm these results. Niederman et al. [31] presented an abstract comparing the antibacterial treatment intervals in patients with AECB receiving antimicrobial therapy. Patients were divided into those that received \u03b2-lactams (n = 185), macrolides (n = 180) and quinolones (n = 131). When the prescribing physician documented that the antimicrobial was used to treat a relapse, there was a significant difference in treatment intervals between patients who received quinolones compared with the other groups (27.5, 17.5 and 18 days for quinolones, macrolides and \u03b2-lactams, respectively, p = 0.03).",

More research needs to be gathered on whether newer antimicrobials prevent treatment failure and hospitalization to a greater extent than older antimicrobials. Finally, if newer antimicrobials do have a positive effect on outcomes, is this because of better coverage of the resistant organisms that may be causing the exacerbation? Investigating whether resistant organisms cause AECB as frequently as sensitive organisms, and determining whether resistance is a factor in the outcome of AECB would be of interest to all who treat these patients.
