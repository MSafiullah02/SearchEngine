Clinical outcome parameters were length of PICU stay, prevalence and duration of mechanical ventilator support, rate of tracheostomy, and 30 day mortality. In patients who received a tracheostomy, we assumed that the date of discontinuation of ventilator support was the date of transfer to a general ward. High risk for severe RSV infection was defined based on previous studies or guidelines as the presence of one of the following risk factors:8, 18 prematurity (gestational age <35 weeks), CLD, HS\u2010CHD, CAA, NMD, Down syndrome, or profound immunocompromisation.

These six PICU admissions were not due to RSV infection itself but were due to severe or progressing status of underlying disease. Two patients with encephalitis were admitted to PICU with decreased mental status, not for respiratory tract infection itself. Three patients with congenital heart disease were admitted to PICU for planned open heart surgery, and RSV infection was found on routine active surveillance or evaluation.

Infants with NMD/CAA are not eligible for PZ prophylaxis in South Korea, and no studies have reported PZ prophylaxis rates for children with HS\u2010CHD. A recent study of 466 infants with HS\u2010CHD in South Korea reported that 39% did not receive PZ prophylaxis on time.25 In addition, the present study period includes the 2008\u20132009 RSV season, during which HS\u2010CHD patients were not eligible for PZ prophylaxis. As a result, PZ prophylaxis for many children with HS\u2010CHD might have been delayed. Furthermore, as shown in the present study, even according to restrictive 2013 K\u2010NHIS guidelines, 24 patients (38.7%) were already eligible for PZ prophylaxis and should have received it. Only six patients (6.5%), however, had received PZ at least once before PICU admission due to RSV infection. Therefore, it is also important to promote adherence to PZ prophylaxis for high\u2010risk children among physicians in daily clinical practice.",

The eligibility for PZ prophylaxis for the present patients ranged from 39% to 48% based on guidelines from South Korea, EU, and the USA. The main differences were inclusion or exclusion of children with NMD/CAA and differences in the age restrictions used to define prematurity and HS\u2010CHD.12, 13 The age restrictions used to identify high\u2010risk children are based on many studies on prophylactic effects and cost\u2013benefit analyses.11, 13, 14 In contrast, children with NMD/CAA or profound immunocompromisation might not be included in the current guidelines due to insufficient data on the effectiveness of PZ prophylaxis. Therefore, large\u2010scale investigations to prove the effectiveness of PZ prophylaxis for these high\u2010risk groups are needed. In addition, although there is no doubt that Down syndrome is a risk factor for severe RSV infection, it remains controversial as to whether PZ prophylaxis is efficacious, including the cost\u2013benefit aspects.26, 27, 28 Therefore, further studies are needed.",

Children with NMD/CAA were also more likely to receive tracheostomy than children in the no\u2010risk group, with borderline significance (40%, 2/5 vs 0%, 0/45; P = 0.053). Defects in respiratory defense mechanisms such as impaired ability to clear secretions and/or insufficient coughing due to weakness of the respiratory muscles are barriers to weaning children off mechanical ventilation. Although there were insufficient patients with NMD/CAA to show a cost difference, prolonged ventilator support means longer PICU care, which requires additional medical resources, thereby generating a larger socioeconomic burden (Table 5).",

We wanted to express the clinical outcomes of PICU admissions due to severe RSV infection including high mortality rate of 5%, as well as the economic burden of PICU admission due to RSV. We also assessed the eligibility for PZ prophylaxis based on different guidelines. Finally, we observed that children with NMD/CAA represent a significant portion of PICU admissions in South Korea, where these children are not eligible for PZ prophylaxis. Moreover, children with NMD/CAA appear to require a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation than those with no risk. Therefore, it is worth noting that the children with NMD/CAA might have comprised a larger portion of the RSV\u2010related PICU admissions, if the PZ prophylaxis had been appropriately given to children with already well\u2010known high risks according to the K\u2010NHIS guidelines.",
