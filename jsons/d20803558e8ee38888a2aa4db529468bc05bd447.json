This study explored how 1 such event, the 2009/2010 influenza (H1N1) pandemic, impacted health care utilization and associated costs in the Military Health System. Methods: Data from the Military Data Repository were used to examine diagnoses, claims data, and dates of services with respect to military or civilian care during 2004-2009/2010 influenza seasons. Comparison analysis was conducted through two-tailed t-tests and regression models. Results: There was a significant increase in inpatient and outpatient health care utilization during the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic year, most markedly for emergency department visits. The 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic cost the Department of Defense $100 million compared to influenza-related health care costs incurred in previous influenza seasons. Highest health care utilization costs were found in children less than age 5. The greatest cost burden was attributed to immunizations for active duty personnel delivered at military facilities. Conclusion: Annual trend analysis of costs and health care utilization would be helpful to plan and resource emerging influenza pandemics and to identify subgroups at greatest risk for contracting influenza.",

Over the last decade, there have been several instances where outbreaks of infectious disease, as public health emergencies, have repeatedly challenged military policies for preparedness. In addition to localized outbreaks, international pandemics have become a focal concern because of their impact on available resources in both civilian and military health care systems. Since the 1918 influenza, the United States has helped mitigate the spread of disease during pandemics, but recent global epidemics have shifted the focus to strengthened preparedness for such public health emergencies. 1 The growing number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, like the severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus in 2003 and the Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 pandemic in 2009, have highlighted the rapid progression of localized epidemics into global pandemics. 2 Available treatment options with novel pathogens are typically limited during such global public health emergencies, thus necessitating greater reliance on emergency outpatient or inpatient supportive care. From a health systems management perspective, the large influx of patients being treated for either an unknown virulent etiology or supportive therapy can easily overburden health care facilities.",

The Military Health System (MHS), which maintains health care services for U.S. armed services personnel and their families, has extensive experience with influenza disease epidemics, such as the 1976 outbreak of H1N1 that was detected after the death of an Army recruit in Fort Dix, New Jersey. 3 This outbreak resulted in a mass vaccination program across the United States and initiated a collaborative approach between CHAMPUS (now TRICARE, the system of health care plans for the U.S. Armed Forces and beneficiaries), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local/ regional health departments. Twenty years after the Fort Dix incident, an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) on a Navy ship led to the discovery of an antigenically distinct H3N2 5 Other types of communicable diseases have similarly challenged military preparedness policies such as outbreaks of pertussis, 6 occupational exposures to blood-borne pathogens or enteroviruses, 7 and food-borne infectious diarrhea. 8 Federal experiences identifying and controlling new strains of influenza are critical for military preparedness and the health care of DoD beneficiaries. 9 As part of national pandemic preparedness, DoD policy now authorizes individual military base commanders to plan and coordinate response activities with local public health officials based on local declaration of public health emergencies. 10 DoD also contributes to national pandemic control by assisting in diagnostic testing of laboratory samples and reporting of influenza prevalence data through the DoD Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics, published online at the Force Health Protection Pandemic Influenza Watch Board. 10, 11 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the World Health Organization reported 477,593 laboratory positive cases and 17,919 fatal cases from 214 countries. 12 In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory confirmed 2,117 fatal cases and 41,821 reported hospitalizations. 13 Although laboratory-confirmed cases provide real-time case counts during a public health emergency, estimates are likely to be greater because of underreporting.",

The MDR captured immunizations rendered to patients in a military health care setting only. Influenza immunization rendered in civilian settings were not tracked as non-AD beneficiaries may obtain immunization through multiple sources that may not be entered as MDR claims data (e.g., employment, free public health programs). Our analytical dataset consisted of outpatient encounters, inpatient stays, and medication records rendered through MTFs and civilian care, October 2004 through April 2010. We included encounter records if they had specific and nonspecific codes associated with ILI, influenza immunization, and associated treatments. Individuals with multiple influenza-related encounters were only counted once per season. Each record contained the month/year of the service encounter, the patient pseudoidentifier, sex, age, beneficiary category, branch of service, state of residence, and type of TRICARE enrollment plan (MTF Prime, Managed Care Support Contractor Prime, and non-Prime). The final dataset was aggregated to person-level records to enable characterization of the 2009 H1N1 influenza patient. Age was grouped by 0-4, 5-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-64, and 65 years or older. Beneficiary categories were AD, family members of AD, military retirees and family members of retirees age 65, and military retirees and family members age 65 or older.",

The models controlled for the number of beneficiaries, age mix, beneficiary category, seasonality, and the underlying time trend. The time trend was modeled based on an explicit, independent variable that increased by one unit per month from October 2004 (month 1) through January 2010 (month 64).

Relative to the preceding influenza season, utilization of 2009-2010 health care services for ILI increased at both military and civilian-contracted facilities, with the largest increases observed for emergency department visits (854.5% in military and 524.3% in civilian facilities). ILI office visits increased 532.1% and 324.6% at military and civilian facilities, respectively, whereas inpatient dispositions increased 513.0% and 284.2% at military and civilian facilities, respectively. In both Tables II and III show the HI1N1 cost impact by age group and type/source of care, respectively. For the estimated $84 million H1N1 impact that could be allocated to the patient level (Table II) , 61% of the cost increase was attributable to care rendered to beneficiaries aged 0 to 24 years, whereas 72% of the cost increase was due to care rendered to AD service members and their family members. Table III indicates where the total of $156.7M was spent on ILI from July 2009 to January 2010. This total was approximately $100M more than projected for these months during a normal influenza season. Table III includes $15.9M for DoD-purchased H1N1 vaccine that could not be allocated in the patient-level cost data. Treatment costs accounted for 58% of the $100M overall cost impact, whereas immunization-related costs, including the DoD purchase of vaccine, accounted for 42%. The regression models showed that there was a high cost burden for civilian inpatient hospitalization and civilian outpatient services across the period of analysis. The highest health care utilization costs were found for children ages 5 to 17. The overall greatest cost burden, however, was incurred for immunizations delivered at MTFs. The estimated costs from the regression models and the actual costs for each influenza season by month between October 2004 and January 2010 are presented in Figure 1 . ",

The DoD experience with the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic is remarkably similar to experiences found in the nation as a whole, at least among populations with access to health care. Our findings closely mirror those based on U.S. civilian populations, i.e., heavy reliance on emergency departments 15 and high rates of ILI among beneficiaries less than age 18. 16 The increased rates of health care utilization and costs observed in the DoD pediatric population is particularly concerning, given a new report that concludes that the nation's capacity to care for pediatric populations during the 2009/2010 influenza season was marginally adequate; had the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic been more virulent, tertiary pediatric facilities would have been overwhelmed. 17 Further, in contrast to our findings, the U.S. civilian population saw a heavier burden of ILI among young adults. 18 Most young adults included in our DoD population were AD personnel, who, unlike their civilian counterparts, were required to be vaccinated for H1N1.",

One strategy, based on estimated models when immunization resources are scarce and the influenza incidence is declining, is to consider immunizing school-age children as well as high-risk adults. 20 Although DoD has clear requirements for vaccinating AD personnel, there are no such directives for vaccinating family members. Another strategy is to consider closing elementary schools on DoD installations, the length of closure dependent on pandemic severity as modeled elsewhere using civilian schools. 21 In addition, to assist fiscal and resource planning, we recommend time trends that compare rates and costs to previous influenza seasons be conducted annually for each MTF. Finally, we recommend that future study be directed to evaluating effective models of triaging individuals who present with ILI symptoms, particularly for those presenting in emergency departments.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Our inclusion of nonspecific vaccine administration codes in the MDR may have captured vaccines unrelated to influenza. Only vaccines administered in the health care setting are captured in the MDR, but some immunizations are administered to service members in the field; thus, total vaccine-related costs for DoD are underestimated in our study. Cost allocation data, particularly for care rendered in the military hospitals, were not specific to immunization clinics or different types of immunizations. Immunizations or treatment for ILI may have occurred as part of a broader health care visit, and ILI costs may not have been identified. Moreover, our cost estimation methodology may not have generated an accurate estimate for all events because we only had cost data through January 2010. To some extent, comparison with prior influenza seasons mitigates the impact of this limitation, assuming that health care practices persisted across the 2004-2009 influenza seasons. Yet another limitation, out of concern for patient privacy, is that we did not conduct analysis at the MTF level. Therefore, we neither examined the prevalence of H1N1 cases, health care utilization, or costs by individual MTFs nor consider MTF facility size, the number of available beds, and size of outpatient clinics in relation to the number of cases received at a particular facility. Finally, while the cost of care provided in civilian settings is directly calculated from government payments/costs at a claim level, military care costs are reported in aggregate (by clinic) and then fitted and allocated to the detail \"visit\" level; hence, military care costs are inexact comparisons to civilian costs.",

In particular, review and evaluation of strategies that address our capacity to care for the DoD pediatric population during an influenza pandemic is warranted, as is the need to manage increased demand on emergency departments during such events.",
