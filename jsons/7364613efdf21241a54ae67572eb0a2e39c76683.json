Narrower confidence intervals, indicating high quantification precision were obtained in 100 and 1000-fold serial dilution and RT-dPCR results were equivalent between different assays in the same dilution. High accuracy of this test allowed conclusions regarding the ability of this technique to evaluate precisely the amount of genomic copies present in a sample.

In 2003, an outbreak of a severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) caused by CoV 1 changed the point of view of mankind about this virus (Holmes, 2003) . In January of 2020, a new CoV (SARS-CoV2) emerges in Hubei province, China, causing severe respiratory disease, affecting over 80 thousand people in that region. Currently, the disease is known as COVID-19 (CoV disease 2019), the infection causes variable degree of severity, usually severe, seldom fatal in individuals with other diseases and the elderly, with case-fatality rate between 8% and 15% in this age in China. High transmissibility is the main difference between SARS-CoV2 and other CoV genotypes affecting humans (Wu & McGoogan, 2020 , Velavan & Meyer, 2020 . The high rate of transmissibility has impaired the local control of SARS-CoV2 in China, allowing it to spread to Europe and Americas. In Italy and Spain, it has been especially severe, reaching higher case-fatality and causing a collapse of official health services (Lazzerini & Putoto, 2020) . SARS-CoV2 infections are now in acceleration phase in the Americas, with over 200.000 cases in the US, and over 1 million cases around the world.",

These samples presented a low precision value. Precision value is calculated based on the confidence interval estimated for the sample. Target titration through digital PCR relies on Poison distribution using chips with microscopic partitions where individual PCR reaction occurs with a probe based assay, allowing a quantification based on negative to positive rates among these partitions. Chips used in this experiment have 20.000 partitions, in general, 20% of negative partitions results in good precision values. Precision of RT-dPCR quantification indicates how reliable is the result achieved in a reaction, it is directly related to confidence interval, with a narrower confidence interval resulting in desirable precision values and consistent target quantification results. Precision is dependent on target concentration, and ideal precision can be achieved by serial dilutions. Ideal concentrations are those with lower precision values and narrower confidence intervals (Majumdar, et al., 2015) .",

It is possible to observe very close quantification and precision results for the three probes at the same concentration. Distribution of reactions in the chips were also very similar, as shown in Figure 1 . These results indicate that these primer-probe assays are suitable for SARS-CoV2 quantification through RT-dPCR. All three assays target the same gene, but in different locations and the similarity of the results in two different concentrations and 3 different probes reinforce the reliability of this technique in titration of genomic copies without need of excessive direct viral manipulation and time consuming techniques. The limit of detection reported for these assays was of 6,25 copies/\u00b5L (FDA). Control samples in diluted in 1:10\u207b 5 presented an estimated value of approximately 3 copies per \u00b5L, however here cDNA was diluted in water, moreover, these samples were above the cutoff value established for interpretation of reliable quantification assays. Results obtained by this method can be applied in RT-qPCR reactions, using the same dilution that presented better precision values and narrower confidence interval in the quantitative curve of the RT-qPCR, and additional 10-fold dilutions above and below these values. This method is an alternative to classical method of viral titration used in RT-qPCR curves, it is faster and safer than classical methods, it can be applied in BSL2 laboratories and only cDNA is needed, therefore controls that are shared between multiple laboratories can be quantified in a single laboratory. All these situations are very common during this pandemic crisis, hence, this technique might be helpful nowadays.",
