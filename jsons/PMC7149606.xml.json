Often, the limiting step in starting an antiviral discovery project is making the commercial case that the return on investment will be sufficient to justify the work. This issue is particularly the case for acute viral infections. The history of such projects is often that they fail to get off the ground because the commercial case is based on attempting to treat the \u201cotherwise healthy\u201d population. This approach is often superficially attractive simply because the numbers of such patients are so large.

In addition, metabolically labile groups, for example, ester and oximes, are common (CA603 (7), pirodavir (2), and BTA188 (4); Fig. 2). Pleconaril was the first molecule in which these issues were addressed (through the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl-substituted oxadiazole system) and demonstrated satisfactory oral pharmacokinetics.6 The latest inhibitor BTA798 (5) (vapendavir)7 utilizes a benzisoxazole replacement for the labile functionality. This isostere appears to provide an orally bioavailable compound, although the bioavailability of 94% in rats is reported at a rather large dose of 50 mg kg\u2212 1 and retains the potential for the saturation of any metabolic processes that may occur at lower doses closer to the therapeutic range.",

The 3C protease is essential for replication and is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein into the active enzymes and structural components. Viral encoded proteases have been extensively explored as targets for chronic viral infections. These efforts inspired pioneering work on the equivalent rhinovirus enzyme by the Agouron group (later acquired by Pfizer). This team used a structure-based approach to optimize 3C protease inhibitors, culminating in ruprintivir (8) (formerly AG-7088), a potent agent active against all the rhinovirus isolates tested and some other picornaviruses.15 The compound is a peptidomimetic whose design is based upon the picornaviral cleavage-site recognition characteristics. In these proteases, most cleavages occur between glutamine and glycine residues. In addition, the rhinovirus 3C protease catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and glutamic acid with a geometry similar to those observed in trypsin-like serine proteases suggested the incorporation of a covalent modifier warhead, specifically the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester present in AG-7088. Incorporation of a cyclic butyramide at P1 provided the optimal structure shown in Fig. 3\n. A detailed description of the optimization of the structural elements P2, P3, and P4 has been published.16\n",

The discovery and progress toward clinical evaluation of presatovir (GS-5806) have been described recently.49 A moderately active screening hit (20, Fig. 7\n) with a poor oral pharmacokinetic profile was transformed in an efficient manner into the clinical compound. Of note is the role of the pendant amine in presatovir, perhaps incorporated to target potential salt-bridge binding interactions as described earlier. A further recent disclosure50 draws a comparison between the improved lung distribution properties of presatovir and its alcohol analog (21, Fig. 7). This advantage of the basic amine-containing compound is rationalized as product of the interaction at lung epithelial cells with phospholipids, phosphatidyl choline, or fatty acids in the pulmonary surfactant.",

The 1\u2032-cyano group (29, Fig. 11\n) provided potency and selectivity for viral polymerases, while the C-linked pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]-triazin-4-amine base fragment (28, Fig. 10) is stable to deglycosylation. A program to identify a suitable prodrug of GS-441524 provided GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate, which has potent in vitro activity against multiple filoviruses, with EC50 values in the 0.1\u20130.2 \u03bcM range (Ref. 67; http://www.usamriid.army.mil, Oct. 9, 2015). In a rhesus monkey model of Ebola infection, the compound was effective in a therapeutic mode.68 GS-5734 has activity against not only filoviruses but also arenaviruses and coronaviruses. The compound\u2019s clinical potential mandated its use in a Scottish nurse who had contracted the Ebola infection while working with patients in Sierra Leone. She was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London and discharged Jan. 2015 but was readmitted to the same hospital in Oct. 2015, when her Ebola virus infection relapsed in the form of acute meningitis.",

The fatality rate is high\u201474% in horses and 60% in humans, infected by contact with diseased horses. More than 50 outbreaks of Hendra have occurred since the virus emerged. A vaccine is available for horses, but there are little data on efficacy. Nipah virus emerged in 1998 on pig farms in Malaysia with 257 human infections and 105 deaths. The virus may have the ability for transfer between humans as it causes respiratory infections. Again, the virus\u2019s natural host is thought to be a fruit bat. Fruit bats excrete the virus in urine, which probably contaminates pig feed. Since 1998, eight further outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh and the neighboring areas of India.",

In hepatitis C, we have seen effective cures for patients, reducing treatment times from a year to a few weeks. This success can now be applied to acute viral infections. Using four examples of respiratory tract infection, we have sought to illustrate the different challenges that need to be overcome to bring a new medicine to patients.
