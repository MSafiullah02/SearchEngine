            "text": "The silver (svr) gene was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster by Bridges in the early 1920s and it maps near the distal end of chromosome X.1, 2, 3, 4 Adult fruit flies with mutations in this gene display cuticles that are pale and silvery in color due to reduced melanization, a finding that gave rise to the name of the gene. Silver includes nine exons (1A, 1B, and 2\u20138), which code for eight different mRNA splicing variants. These result in two short protein variants of 433 (protein svr-PE alias \u201c1A short\u201d) and 435 [svr-PF alias \u201c1B short\u201d and DmCPD1Bs (D\n. melanogaster carboxypeptidase D variant 1B short)] residues and in six long forms spanning between 1259 and 1439 residues (svr-PB, svr-PC, svr-PD, svr-PG, svr-PH, and svr-PI; see UniProt sequence database entry P42787 and Fig. 1a).3, 4, 5, 6 The long variants possess the overall modular structure and sequence features of carboxypeptidase D (CPD), a glycosylated 180-kDa enzyme studied since the middle 1990s in fruit fly, mouse, rat, duck, bovine, chicken, and humans.7, 8, 9 CPD was localized to the trans-Golgi network, the secretory and reuptake pathways, and transiently on the cell surface.10 It was hypothesized to remove basic C-terminal residues from proteins and peptides supporting the endoproteolytic action of furin-like serine proprotein convertases of the subtilisin/kexin type. Thus, CPD would contribute to processing of hormones (e.g., adipokinetic hormone and bradykinin), growth factors, neurotransmitters, and other bioactive peptides (e.g., dynorphin B-14) that follow the secretory and endocytic pathways.10, 11, 12, 13 Moreover, it has been suggested that arginine released by CPD from peptide substrates may stimulate the production of nitric oxide, an important regulator of cellular processes such as neurotransmission, vasodilatation, and tumor progression and survival.14, 15\n",

This also happens in Drosophila variants encoded by exon 1B (see Refs. 5 and 6 and Fig. 1a). When isolated, the two funnelin repeats show different pH optima and specificity. The N-terminal repeat is more active at neutral pH and prefers arginine over lysine at the C-terminus of peptide substrates. In contrast, the second repeat prefers slightly acidic environments (pH 5\u20136) and excises lysines slightly more efficiently than arginines.6 Variants encompassing both repeats have broader pH optimum and substrate specificity than single-repeat variants. This is consistent with the conditions found throughout the secretory pathway, in which pH ranges from 5 to 7.5, 6 The third funnelin domain of CPD is catalytically incompetent as it lacks critical residues, but it may maintain the overall \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase scaffold.10 In the duck, it was reported to be recognized by the pre-S region of the large envelope protein of hepatitis B virus during infection.23, 24 This is reminiscent of ACE2, a CP belonging to another structural group, the cowrins,25 which is the receptor for human SARS coronavirus.26 In contrast to the long, three-repeat variants, the two Drosophila short forms have only the first repeat, and they are secreted and soluble (Fig. 1a and b). Among them, only DmCPD1Bs is catalytically active.5, 6 Although both short forms are present in the Golgi and may participate in physiological processes, the lack of membrane anchors makes them transient. Moreover, the endocytic vesicles contain only the long forms.5 In addition, while the membrane anchors can regulate the long forms through localization/compartmentalization, the soluble DmCPD1Bs may be regulated in a different way along the secretory pathway.",

However, although we assayed several purification strategies, the presence of several bands in SDS-PAGE could not be avoided. N-terminal sequencing of these bands revealed that they were cleavage products of the target protein occurring after Leu189 that co-purified with the intact enzyme. Subsequent assays with different broad-spectrum inhibitors against the major classes of endopeptidases revealed that addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) during protein expression significantly limited degradation, giving rise to mainly two major bands (Fig. 1c, left lane). In contrast, inhibitors of metallo-, cysteine, and aspartyl proteinases had no appreciable effect. As a control, intact protein obtained in the presence of PMSF and purified was assayed for susceptibility to proteolysis by commercial trypsin and subtilisin. These experiments revealed similar degradation patterns to those observed during production in the absence of PMSF. In the case of subtilisin, cleavage occurred after Leu189, and for trypsin, cleavage occurred after Arg190 (Fig. 1c, right lane). According to the provisional genome sequence\u2021\n(see Ref. 28), P. pastoris apparently encodes four soluble serine endopeptidases: a putative Kex2 subtilisin-like proprotein convertase, a sequence relative of the mammalian Omi/HtrA2 family of trypsin-like serine proteases, and two putative orthologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae YscB alias cerevisin (UniProt P09232). The latter enzyme belongs to the subtilisin/kexin family of serine peptidases and preferentially cleaves after arginine, tyrosine, or leucine according to MEROPS database.29 Therefore, either of the cerevisin orthologs in P. pastoris may be responsible for the cleavage after Leu189 observed during recombinant overexpression of DmCPD1Bs.",

Treatment with endoglycosidase F and N-terminal sequencing revealed that they were glycosylation variants of the intact target protein. There are two potential glycosylation sites in the enzyme at Asn133 and Asn269. We tried to reduce heterogeneity by constructing two mutants, N133Q and N269Q. However, the expression yield of both single mutants was dramatically lower than that of the wild type. In addition, both mutants still displayed heterogeneous glycosylation. The double mutant N133Q/N269Q could not be expressed. These results underpinned the relevance of sugars for this protein, in good agreement with the importance of protein glycosylation in the secretory pathway.30\n",

This is consistent with previous reports on DmCPD1Bs produced in baculovirus, which was also active.5, 6 Reported values for human CPN evince slightly lower activity for this substrate due to its preference for C-terminal lysine residues (Table 1). We further produced and purified human CPB to provide a standard for an A/B-type funnelin for comparison and it had about 10-fold higher efficiency. This is in accordance with previous studies, which showed that \u201cdigestive\u201d funnelins are more efficient CPs than \u201cregulatory\u201d forms against small substrates.9, 34 Moreover, intact DmCPD1Bs previously incubated with commercial subtilisin or trypsin (see above) had an \u223c 70% decrease of activity.

The catalytic domain (CD) has a compact globular shape, which resembles the volume obtained when a cone is extracted from a sphere (Figs. 2a and b). There is a funnel-like opening to the left, within which the active-site cleft lies, at the base of the opening. The cleft is rather shallow, which is compatible with the capacity of funnelins to cleave a large variety of substrates, as only few contacts between the enzyme and the C-terminal stretch of a substrate are required to fix the latter to the active site.

The catalytic site is located at the C-terminal end of these strands, as observed in other funnelins.16 These four strands are flanked by two parallel strands at the top (\u03b26\u2013\u03b27) and a \u03b2-ribbon (\u03b21\u2013\u03b22) at the bottom (Fig. 2a and b). The sheet curvature leads to a concave front side, which shelters helices \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b18, and \u03b19, as well as the active-site cleft. At the back of the molecule, the convex side of the sheet accommodates the surface N- and C-termini of the molecule, as well as helices \u03b11\u2013\u03b14, \u03b17, \u03b18, and the C-terminal helix \u03b110 of the CD, which runs left to right across the molecule along the convex face of the \u03b2-sheet and is bent by \u223c 40\u00b0. The funnel-like access to the active site is shaped by irregular segments of disparate length: the loop connecting strand \u03b23 with helix \u03b12 (L\u03b23\u03b12), L\u03b25\u03b26, L\u03b26\u03b17, L\u03b17\u03b27, and, in particular, the 55-residue segment connecting strand \u03b24 with helix \u03b16 (segment \u03b24\u03b16 hereafter). This element contributes to the lower front of the molecule, shapes the funnel rim, and includes two short helices, \u03b14 and \u03b15. Between five and nine residues are missing in each of the four molecules present in the asymmetric unit within the surface-located L\u03b15\u03b16 (hereafter referred to as \u201cregulatory loop\u201d) within segment \u03b24\u03b16. Two disulfide bonds also contribute to the funnel rim by cross-linking loop L\u03b14\u03b15 with L\u03b28\u03b110 (Cys156-Cys309) and L\u03b17\u03b27 with L\u03b28\u03b110 (Cys268-Cys308). In addition, a conspicuous disulfide bond between neighboring residues is found within L\u03b26\u03b17 (Cys236-Cys237; see Fig. 2a and b).",

These residues are provided by L\u03b23\u03b12 and by the end of strand \u03b25. The protein was co-crystallized in the presence of the small-molecule inhibitor GEMSA (Fig. 2c), which mimics a product complex after substrate cleavage in which the C-terminal residue is still trapped in the S1\u2032 pocket. The carboxymethylene group of the inhibitor binds the catalytic zinc ion asymmetrically through two carboxylate oxygens, thus giving rise to an overall 6-fold metal coordination. The other carboxylate group of GEMSA is anchored to Arg165 N\u03b72, Asn174 N\u03b42, and, bidentately, to Arg175 N\u03b71 and N\u03b72. The guanidinoethylmercapto group, which imitates an arginine side chain, occupies the S1\u2032 pocket and is surrounded by Ser224, Gly279, Trp282, Tyr283, Leu285, Gln290, and Thr303. The characteristic specificity for basic residues of N/E-type funnelins is provided in DmCPD1Bs by the side chain of Asp228, which binds one of the terminal guanidine nitrogen atoms of GEMSA. The role of the general acid/base, essential for catalysis in funnelins and other metal-dependent peptidases,16, 39 is fulfilled here by Glu305.

These strands are arranged as two subsequent Greek-key-like elements related by a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the sandwich surface.21, 40, 41 This domain has topological similarity with transthyretin, a conserved plasma protein that tends to aggregate, thus giving rise to several forms of amyloidosis.42 However, transthyretin contains an eighth C-terminal \u03b2-strand that is absent in funnelins.21 The TLD is laterally attached to the CD and interacts with L\u03b22\u03b23, L\u03b16\u03b25, L\u03b19\u03b28, and L\u03b26\u03b17 of the latter through hydrophobic residues.

Size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the protein is monomeric throughout the concentration range assayed (0.5 to 18 mg/mL, as injected into the FPLC system). In the crystals, which resulted from highly concentrated protein solution (18 mg/mL), two pairs of dimers were found in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2d and e). Inspection of the dimeric interface in the structure reveals that it measures \u223c 950 \u00c52, which is larger than the range described for experimentally validated \u201cweak\u201d transient homodimeric proteins (740 \u00b1 140 \u00c52; Ref. 43). Such proteins form both monomers and dimers at physiological concentration. In DmCPD1Bs, the dimer is symmetric, so that the same structural segments of each protomer are involved in complex formation: helix \u03b16, strands \u03b21 and \u03b22, and loops L\u03b15\u03b16 and L\u03b22\u03b23 of each CD and loops L\u03b211\u03b212 and L\u03b29\u03b210 of each TLD. Two symmetric bidentate salt bridges (Asp353-Arg85) and a total of nine hydrogen bonds are observed at the interface. In addition, the two active-site clefts are located on opposite surfaces of the dimer; that is, there would be no steric hindrance for substrate binding (Fig. 2d). However, there is no concluding evidence that the enzyme is a functional dimer in vivo since the protein seems to be monomeric in solution and the dimer could be an artifact of the crystallization process. Moreover, we do not know whether the formation of a dimer could have functional implications. To date, no higher oligomerization states than a monomer have been reported for funnelins. Only CPN is believed to function in vivo as a tetramer comprising two N/E-type funnelin subunits linked to two non-catalytic regulatory domains,44 but it is not known how these subunits are arranged within the heterotetramer.",

Most changes are conservative or are compensated for by differences in size of the side chains in neighboring positions. However, there is a slight trend towards smaller side chains at positions contributing to the central hydrophobic core of the funnelin domain, which might lower thermal stability: Leu78Ala, Tyr96Leu, Ile97Val, Ile80Ala, Met100Ile, Leu111Val, Leu119Ala, Leu128Val, Met143Cys, and Ser151Ala. In addition, the presence of a histidine replacing an asparagine at position 121 would entail a minor rearrangement of the N-terminal stretch up to Phe34. In turn, the conservation of the N-glycoslyation site motif around Asn133 (Asn-Leu-Thr in exon 1A instead of Asn-Ser-Thr in exon 1B) suggests that the asparagine is also attached to a sugar moiety. However, the presence of a glutamine instead of a glycine at position 129 may entail a rotation of the sugar moiety around the linking bond, N\u03b42\u2013C1, which would provide space for the glutamine side chain. In addition, only a four-residue insertion is found within L\u03b22\u03b23, which should not disturb the interaction of the CD with the TLD (see above) due to the maintenance of leucine residues at positions 89 and 90.",

Although glutamine is a rare zinc ligand in proteins,45, 46 in the case of funnelins, it may lead to metal-containing but catalytically impaired or even inert zinc sites, as reported for zinc-ligand mutants of human glyoxalase I.47 A glutamine at the position equivalent to residue 101 in DmCPD1Bs is also found in a series of (putative) proteins from related Drosophila species, namely, D. ananassae (UniProt B3N0D7), D. willistoni (B4NPC2), D. mojavensis (B4L2T3), D. sechellia (B4IEW7), D. grimshawi (B4JX73), D. erecta (B3NWB3), and D. virilis (B4M2C3). These entries span between 1302 and 1495 residues and could represent three-repeat orthologs of the silver gene product, also encoded by an exon that gives rise to a non-functional funnelin domain. In addition to fruit fly species, a glutamine was found in a potential three-repeat ortholog of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (A7S4K6). In all these cases, it remains to be ascertained whether the glutamine-containing funnelin-like domains are functional, in particular taking into account that a recent report has shown that the third CPD domain greatly contributes to survival of transgenic fruit flies.13\n",

This rim is responsible for interaction with large protein substrates in funnelins.16 In addition, significant differences are found in two loops of the TLD: L\u03b29\u03b210 and, in particular, L\u03b214\u03b215, which is on the back surface of the molecule. This region might be important for function in N/E-type funnelin TLDs (see above) and structural differences might lead to disparate binding partners in duck CPD domain II and DmCPD1Bs. Overall, the most noteworthy difference is found in the regulatory loop, which is partially undefined in DmCPD1Bs (see above).

This would explain why the regulatory loop is a hot spot for cleavage by host proteases during recombinant heterologous overexpression (see above). The equivalent regions of all other N/E-type metallocarboxypeptidases thus far structurally analyzed, that is, duck CPD domain II, human CPN, and human CPM, are well ordered and rigid, and they significantly deviate from the conformation found in DmCPD1Bs, thus pointing to potential differences in the function of this loop (Fig. 3c).

Hence, the presence of eight splicing variants of CPD, which give rise to both single-repeat soluble and two- and three-repeat membrane-anchored forms, may be conceived as a strategy to compensate for this shortage.5 This is reminiscent of the finding that only two matrix metalloproteinase paralogs are found in the fruit fly, while 23 have been described in humans.52 Of the five active N/E-type funnelins in mammals, CPN is secreted into plasma and forms a dimer of heterodimers. CPM is membrane-anchored and functions extracellularly. CPZ is partially targeted to the extracellular matrix and has a frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain that may make it a Wnt-binding protein.22 DmCPD1Bs could have a homologous function to CPE, which is likewise a single-repeat funnelin and is found in secretory vesicles.22 The fruit fly enzyme is active and cleaves synthetic substrates with similar efficiency to human CPE, although the former has a different pH optimum.6 DmCPD1Bs could function as a CPE-like enzyme in mildly acidic regions of the secretory pathway such as the trans-Golgi network. However, further studies are required to validate this hypothesis. Finally, the structure of DmCPD1Bs conforms to the overall fold of N/E-type funnelins, as may be the case for CPE, but evinces two unique features that may correlate with its regulation: (i) two contiguous surface-located cysteines that may become palmitoylated, thus targeting the enzyme to membranes, and (ii) a surface hot spot for proteolytic inactivation. In this way, DmCPD1Bs could participate in Drosophila development through proteolytic processing of substrates previously targeted by furin-like proprotein convertases and would itself be inactivated at later stages by limited proteolysis.",

Fricker (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) and was used as template to generate a PCR-construct encoding DmCPD1Bs without the signal peptide, that is, encompassing amino acids Tyr26 to Phe435 (UniProt P42787, isoform 7). This construct was cloned into the pPICZ\u03b1A vector with a C-terminal His6-tag, and transformed into P. pastoris strain KM71H following the manufacturer's instructions (EasySelect Pichia Expression Kit, Invitrogen). Selected transformant colonies were used to inoculate 1-L shake-flask cultures, which were grown at 28 \u00b0C for 36 h in buffered glycerol-complex medium until OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) reached 20\u201330. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000g, gently resuspended in 100 mL fresh BMMY medium (buffered glycerol-complex medium supplemented with 1% of methanol instead of 1% of glycerol), and cultured at 28 \u00b0C for another 24 h for protein expression. PMSF (0.3 mM) was added to the culture every 3\u20134 h to prevent cleavage of the recombinant protein. For protein purification, the culture supernatant was equilibrated with 30% ammonium sulfate, bound to a hydrophobic chromatography column (butyl-Toyopearl 650 M, Tosoh Bioscience) connected to an \u00c4KTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate. The eluted sample was subsequently dialyzed against 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, and purified by anion-exchange chromatography (TSK-DEAE 5PW, Tosoh Bioscience) by using a linear gradient of 0.4 M ammonium acetate (0 to 30%). DmCPD1Bs was then loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl and 250 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the purest samples containing the active enzyme were pooled. The protein was buffer-exchanged to 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated by using an Amicon Centricon centrifugal device (10-kDa cutoff, Millipore). The typical final yield was \u223c 0.3 mg of protein per liter of growth medium. Western blot using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare) showed that this protein lacked the C-terminal His6-tag, possibly due to autolysis during production/purification, as described for other funnelins.53, 54 Point mutants N133Q, N269Q, and N133Q/N269Q were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis by using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and produced and purified in the same way as the wild-type protein. Human pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B was overexpressed and purified as described for DmCPD1Bs but without addition of PMSF. The enzyme was activated by controlled trypsin digestion as previously described.55\n",
