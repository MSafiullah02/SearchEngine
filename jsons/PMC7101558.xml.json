The co-authors of a research paper could reveal the exchange of knowledge among researchers in their effort to bring out a published paper.

For example, a collaboration could take place (i.e. through research advise) even if the two researchers do not finally end up penning the research paper together. Then there are some issues of honorary and ghost authorships (Wislar et al. Wislar et al. 2011). While these concerns are serious, using bibliometric records is still the most concrete piece of evidence to establish a collaboration. Given the fact that co-authorship associations could also help us in understanding the association at institutional, organizational, and international levels, their significance cannot be overlooked.",

Better communications facilities, faster commuting, and industrialization brought in significant changes in the way research was conducted. Now there are researchers in large teams working on research projects and naturally these lead to published papers having significantly larger numbers of co-authors. Price (1963) calls these large lab-based research projects, \u2018big science\u2019. However, big science research projects aren\u2019t generally in the social domain, that is, researchers do not have much choice to decide on their co-authors. Like the sciences, research conducted in the social sciences has also seen significant increase in the number of co-authors (Moody 2004). It remains imperative to note that collaboration is sharing of knowledge and may not always suggest improved quality of work. For example, in the humanities there are still a significant proportion of papers that are solo-written.",

            "text": "Research Collaborations could also be seen from the perspective of networks (Kumar and Jan 2014). In a network, two entities form a connection if there is some kind of association between them (Newman 2001). Using bibliometric data, these associations could be constructed to understand knowledge flows at multiple levels. Co-authorship in published papers is considered a reliable proxy to gauge research collaborations (Sonnenwald 2008; Melin and Persson 1996; Katz and Martin 1997). Social Network Analysis, an established research method to analyse social networks, is a set of mathematical algorithms that quantitatively analyse these relationships between nodes (Wasserman and Faust 1994). In a co-authorship network, for example, it could be applied to identify various patterns\u2014i.e. the best connected nodes or key actors (Taba et al. 2015) or the communities that the researchers form through their associations. Specifically, these analyses reveal the pattern of network at both global and local levels. At the global level, the network pattern is seen from a whole network perspective, revealing, for example, the density, transitivity, scale-free pattern, small-world pattern, or the communities or clusters that the nodes form. At the local level, things are seen from the node perspective. Centrality is an important concept when looking from the perspective of a node and its context in the entire network. Centrality determines the relative importance (through centrality measures such as betweenness, closeness, and PageRank) and connectedness (through \u2018degree\u2019 metric) of nodes. Hence, those with higher centrality scores are those who are the most prominent players in the network. Another interesting aspect of social networks is that of the ties that the node is directly connected to. The strength of connection (depicted by a thicker line on a network graph) demonstrates a more frequent and stronger relationship than those that have an association of just a single or very few times. The idea of strength of relationship (Coleman 1988) is challenged by the notion of structural holes (Burt 1997). Structural holes theory postulates that the absence of ties in an ego network (network of ego\u2014central node- and alters or immediate connections and those immediate connections connecting to one another) brings in more opportunities to the ego (the central node) as the ego then acts a bridge for the flow of resources between the \u2018alters\u2019. Yet another idea of ties is postulated by the concept of \u2018weak ties\u2019. The theory argues that in contrast to strong ties, which bring in trust, weak ties bring in new knowledge in the network. Growth and preferential attachment are the prime features of self-organising networks (Barabasi and Bonabeau 2003). Preferential attachment (Kumar and Jan 2015) is defined by the preference of nodes (due to affinity or similarity) to attach to another node. In the context of co-authorship network, it may be due to the fact that one author connects to another author because he or she is a well-known researcher or has the same nationality as others. Preferential attachment causes some nodes to have much higher number of connections than most other nodes in the network. These hubs are kind of \u2018power houses\u2019 that tie together the network. This is the very reason why a self-organising network are small worlds (has a short path between any two random nodes) (Watts and Strogatz 1998). A targeted attack or absence due to some other reason could break the network down into pieces, which could severely affect the flow of resources in the network. Nonetheless, these self-organising networks are quite tolerant to random attacks (Albert et al. 2000).",

Their study concluded that the new strain of virus causes HPS. A high fatality rate (76 %) was also reported. One of the earliest studies on disease caused Hantavirus (Nephropathia Epidemia or NE) and highly cited paper is that of Brummerkorvenkontio et al. (1980).

Clustering coefficient or transitivity is a measure of prediction that if nodes B and C have common partner A, it is a likelihood that B would eventually connect with C. We surmise that this is due to the fact that a node or ego with many alters, will likely have alters that have less connections among them. This is true in many occasions as the ego with large connections would have these connections from several diverse set of nodes.",

Our correlation test (see Table 3) confirms that indeed in hantavirus datasets there is a significant correlation (p < 0.01) between centrality measures (or how well the author is connected with others in the community) and research performance.\n",

In our opinion, these bonded communities are the core or \u201ccentral brain\u201d of the network where central activity takes place. We also theorize that strength of relationship is an equally important criterion (apart from centrality measures) for sustainable research performance. PageRank stands out in its correlation with the research performance which further substantiate the idea that it is not only the number of other authors an author is connected to but the quality of these authors (how well those co-authors are connected) that ensures research visibility.",
