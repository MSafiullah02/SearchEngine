            "text": "Hepatitis E virus, a member of the genus Hepevirus under the family Hepeviridae, has caused several outbreaks in developing countries and has prevalence in developed countries. HEV is transmitted predominantly by a fecal-oral route (Aggarwal and Krawczynshi, 2000, Hsieh et al., 1999); its prevalence is mainly waterborne. HEV is transmitted across species in humans, pigs, deer and rodents, and can cause experimental infection in chickens, cats and nonhuman primates (Arankalle et al., 2001, Feagins et al., 2008, Gardner and Luciw, 2008, Okamoto et al., 2004, Tei et al., 2003, Vitral et al., 2005). Evidence has proven that HEV is a zoonotic virus, with pigs as the main reservoirs of HEV in nature. Meng et al. (2002) showed that veterinarians working with swine were at increased risk of HEV infection and HEV has been found in commercially available pig livers (Feagins et al., 2007, Bouwknegt et al., 2007). Travelers in endemic countries, including India, Nepal, China, Africa and Mexico are at high risk of infection with hepatitis E virus (Abreu, 2007). Therefore, it is urgent to develop an effective strategy for prevention of HEV infection.",

            "text": "Given that all four HEV genotypes (1\u20134) correspond to one serotype; vaccines may be helpful to control for HEV infections (Tsarev et al., 1993, He et al., 1993, Gardner and Luciw, 2008). Purified polypeptide vaccine has completed a phase 3 trials (Abreu, 2007, Mushahwar, 2008). The safety and efficacy of this recombinant vaccine were tested after three vaccine doses (at months 0, 1, and 6) in subjects in the Nepalese Army (Shrestha et al., 2007). However, questions were subsequently raised, the exclusively male subjects and inconsistent data in humans and in rhesus monkeys (Krawczynski, 2007, Tacke and Trautwein, 2007). Even if all of these questions are resolved, vaccinations (three times) will take 6 months, but susceptive animals (pigs or rodents) can transmit the disease as early as the first week post-infection and can continue to do so for at least several weeks (Halbur et al., 2001, Shrestha et al., 2007). Moreover, immune escapes can also occur as new virulent HEV variants evolve, as the case with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) evolved from human coronavirus (Lin et al., 2007, Saif, 2004). In this respect, the mutational events in cell cultures that have been reported during the primary propagation and consecutive passages (p5, p10, and p13) reported in 2008 (Lorenzo et al., 2008, Tanaka et al., 2008) are particularly worrisome.",

RNAi is a phenomenon in which small double-stranded RNA molecules induce sequence-specific degradation of homologous single-stranded RNA (Hannon, 2002). RNAi is a powerful tool to investigate gene function through specific suppression of a particular mRNA, and has been employed in therapeutic studies of human diseases, including cancer, neurogenerative diseases and viral infectious diseases. Similar strategies were capable to reduce significantly SARS-CoV replication (Akerstrom et al., 2007) and hepatitis C virus mRNA accumulation (Liu et al., 2006), which suggests that RNAi may be one of the most useful antiviral therapy strategies currently being investigated. As the field of RNAi has expanded, much research has been reported for many genes of interest, including oncogenes and viral genes, indicating their successful silencing in both cells and animal models (Akerstrom et al., 2007, Kirchhoff, 2008, Kleinman et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2006). There have also been a number of clinical trials using RNAi strategies, including one on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Kleinman et al., 2008), and more applications are expected.",

This was used as template for a reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction PCR (RT-nPCR) to amplify the HEV ORF2 gene. The ORF2 gene encodes the major structural or capsid protein of HEV (Riddell et al., 2000). The external forward primer and reverse primer were 5\u2032-CGATTTTGCGCTTGAGCTTGA-3\u2032 (P1) and 5\u2032-TGGAGACCGAGCGCACGGCAC-3\u2032 (P2), respectively. The internal forward primer and reverse primer were 5\u2032-CTCGGCGGGCTCCCGACAG-3\u2032 (P3) and 5\u2032-AGGTGCGAGGACACCAACGGCAG-3\u2032 (P4), respectively. RT-nPCR analysis was conducted using an AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL kit for RT-PCR (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's directions. The RT-PCR protocol performed included a reverse transcription phase at 42 \u00b0C for 30 min and 85 \u00b0C for 15 s. Two microliters of the cDNA synthesized were then amplified by nested PCR at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 42 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and repeated for 29 cycles. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on agarose gel containing 0.5 \u03bcg/mL ethidium bromide. The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into the multicloning site of a eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, a gift from Dr. Wei Liu) which contains the reporter gene of enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP), using standard cloning procedures with the restriction sites of EcoRI and BamHI. The EGFP gene was located downstream of the target genes. The recombinant plasmid was named pEGFP-ORF2.",

A549 cells were trypsinized and transferred to 500 \u03bcL antibiotic-free growth medium in 24-well plates at 0.5\u20132.0 \u00d7 105/well. Cells were cultured 24 h before transfection. One microgram of pEGFP-ORF2 recombinant plasmid was diluted in 50 \u03bcL of serum-free DMEM medium, and mixed gently with 0.5 \u03bcL each of the five 20 nM siRNAs and 1.5 \u03bcL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions in 50 \u03bcL of serum-free DMEM medium for 20 min, and then co-transfected to the cells. Meanwhile, each siRNAs were either co-transfected with pEGFP vector or transfected alone into A549 cells to test the interferon response. The optimal combination of four parameters for each cell line, including the highest transfection efficiency, the lowest non-specific effects, the conditions for the most efficient delivery of siRNA, and the concentration of Lipofectamine 2000, was first determined in preliminary experimentation. Four to six hours post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced with fresh complete medium and the cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h for mRNA detection, and 72 h for protein detection. To determine transfection efficiency, the EGFP fluorescence intensity of transfected cells was monitored with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE2000, Tokyo, Japan) before Real-Time qPCR analysis. The efficiency of suppression of the HEV ORF2 gene by various HEV specific siRNAs was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, Real-Time qPCR and Western blot. Specificity of the inhibition was confirmed by co-transfection of the pEGFP-ORF2 recombined plasmid with scrambled siRNA.",

However, as also shown in this study, different siRNA sequences have different interference efficacies, which depending on the characteristics of the target RNA, including local RNA folding and the accessibility of the siRNA-binding site on the target RNA (Kurreck, 2006, Shao et al., 2007). The highest potential efficiency of interference is considered a high knockdown that avoids the degradation of untargeted genes (off-target effects) with the fewer siRNAs (Ladunga, 2006).",
