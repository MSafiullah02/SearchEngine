Due to a number of challenges, including the unpredictable availability of testing materials, testing for the acute infection was sporadic in the early days of the epidemic in the United States. As a result, testing in emergency departments (ED) has been limited and only began to increase following the WHO declaration. We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our two institutional EDs.",

During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients with the following known criteria as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines: patients presenting with symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection (fever AND cough or shortness of breath); travel within 14 days to countries with high rates of infection (at that time China, Iran, Italy, Japan, and South Korea); or risk factors for infection complications (including age or co-morbid conditions); or the patient was a healthcare worker who could potentially expose others at risk. Test ordering was at the discretion of the attending emergency physician based on these criteria.",
