As such, it is possible that in late February many cases from Northern Italy (and possibly from other European areas) were exported all over Europe.

In most scenarios, highly effective case identification and isolation of contacts could control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. However, importantly, the probability of control decreases with delays in the identification of cases and contacts, increased time from onset of symptoms to isolation, fewer cases identified, and increased transmission before symptoms. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker [14] describes variation in government responses and explores whether rising stringency of response affects the rate of infection. They calculate a stringency-risk ratio but warn that recorded cases partly depend on how much testing is done, which is likely to co-vary with the stringency of the government's response. Regular updated results will be available for anyone.",

However, the study predicts that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed and suggests that intermittent social distancing -triggered by trends in disease surveillance -may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily [15] . This strategy needs robust surveillance systems that allow for acceptable sensitivity to timely decide on interventions. We believe these triggers must consider evidence and debate around surveillance system sensitivity and under-ascertainment. As suggested by another Imperial College Report [16] , this would be relevant to produce early evidence when exiting the CO-VID-19 social distancing policy after achieving containment.",

Undetected introduction of imported cases and many mild undetected cases making up those transmission chains may warrant early measures. By looking at the death epidemic curves (likely less sensitive to variations in surveillance system sensitivity) of different countries we see differences that can be related to earlier detection and implementation of measures (Fig. 4) . Notably, South Korea has managed to keep new deaths by COVID-19 low despite being in a relatively advanced stage of the epidemic and is one of the countries with a higher testing rate [8] . An early study [17] estimated the transmission potential of COVID-19 in the country and suggested early sustained disease transmission in the region which contributed to the rapid early implementation of social distancing measures to contain the outbreak [14] . Considering uncertainty and under-ascertainment is critical for decision when 500 cases could possibly mean 5,000. Delay from exposure and infection to reporting must also be considered.",
