Medical educators must rapidly adapt to continue teaching students. The greatest challenge is students have increasingly limited access to patients, the key component of a clinical education. We propose a possible interim solution, in the form of a \u201cdigital clinical placement.\u201d",

The students review a patient\u2019s history, their physical examination findings, investigation results, and management plan on an online platform. The material is subsequently discussed at a webinar with the speciality clinician, during which students can ask and answer questions using an interactive cloud-based tool. This real-time digital interaction simulates bedside teaching and can be supplemented with patient video cases if available.",

Patient video cases are already successfully used in pediatrics, general practice, and geriatrics.2,3 They can increase student exposure to a wider variety of patients and provide opportunities to practice clinical reasoning skills.3 Their use as the sole source of patient contact is untried, though, so it will be vital to evaluate and share any findings.",
