            "text": "Extant Primates are currently split into Strepsirrhini (Lemuriformes) and Haplorhini (Anthropoidea and Tarsius), with Strepsirrhini being the earliest distinct branch of the extant primates (Kay et al., 1997a, Kay et al., 1997b, Bloch et al., 1997, Ni et al., 2013). Genomic data suggest that the estimated time of the most recent common ancestor of Strepsirrhinin and Haplorhini ranged between 58.9 and 68.6 million years (Jameson et al., 2011). Strepsirrhines and, among the haplorhines, the Tarsiidae whose unique extant representative are the tarsiers, appear to have retained several plesiomorphic features of stem primates (Matsui et al., 2009, Rosa et al., 1996). This includes the Dermoptera (colugos or flying lemurs), which have recently been identified as a primate sister taxon that diverged very early at \u223c86 million years ago (e.g. Arnason et al., 2002). For this reason the organization of the various neural systems within the strepsirrhine brain is of interest in understanding the phylogenetic trajectory of primates as a group. To date, no comprehensive mapping of the nuclei of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic or orexinergic systems has been undertaken for any strepsirrhine primate, but data for anthropoid primates such as the pygmy marmoset and the common marmosets, the squirrel monkey, the macaque monkey, the baboon and the human are available (summarized in Maseko et al., 2007, Dell et al., 2010). In this sense, there is a gap in our knowledge of the evolution of the nuclear organization of these systems between primates and other mammals.",

This hypothesis proposes that megachiropterans and microchiropterans are two evolutionarily distinct mammalian groups not related to each other in the same monophyletic order. Instead, the megachiropterans are proposed to have evolved from the dermopteran lineage of gliders (also known as the colugos or \u201cflying lemurs\u201d), which are the acknowledged sister group to primates (Pettigrew, 1986, Pettigrew et al., 1989, Meredith et al., 2011). The \u201cFlying Primate\u201d hypothesis is contentious because of DNA sequence data that appears to refute it, but which may reflect convergent DNA evolution under the selection pressure of high temperature associated with powered flight (Pettigrew and Kirsch, 1995, Pettigrew and Kirsch, 1998, Kirsh and Pettigrew, 1998, Hutcheon et al., 1998, Jabbari and Bernadri, 2004). Nevertheless, there is substantial data coming from brain studies that supports this hypothesis (Pettigrew, 1986, Pettigrew et al., 1989, Pettigrew et al., 2008, Manger et al., 2001, Maseko and Manger, 2007, Maseko et al., 2007, Kruger et al., 2010a, Kruger et al., 2010b, Dell et al., 2010, Dell et al., 2013).",

All progeny of the newly established order will then likely retain the same complement of distinct subdivisions of the various systems irrespective of the subsequently evolution of brain size, phenotype or life history parameters (Manger, 2005). While there are some cases that do not adhere directly to this hypothesis, for example the organization of the locus coeruleus in murid rodents is different from all other rodent groups (Kruger et al., 2012), this framework for understanding changes in mammalian brain evolution at the systems level has been supported by a number of studies (see summaries in Dell et al., 2010, Calvey et al., 2013). Given this background, the current study aimed to analyse the nuclear organization of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems in three previously unstudied strepsirrhine primate species. This was done for two reasons: (1) to determine whether the strepsirrhine and haplorhine primates share an identical complement of nuclei for these systems, providing a primate specific nuclear complement of these systems (Manger, 2005); and (2) to determine whether this potentially primate specific complement of nuclei shares enough similarities with the nuclear complement of the same systems found in megachiropterans (Maseko et al., 2007, Dell et al., 2010) to provide a further test of the \u201cFlying Primate\u201d hypothesis using neuroanatomical data.",

Permits were obtained from the relevant wildlife authority in the Democratic Republic of Congo for G. demidoff and P. potto, as well as from the Copenhagen Zoo for L. catta. All animals were handled according to the guidelines of the University of the Witwatersrand Animal Ethics Committee. Each animal was weighed, anaesthetized and subsequently euthanized with appropriate doses of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg sodium pentobarbital/kg). Upon cessation of respiration the animals were perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), approximately 1 l/kg of each solution, both solutions having a temperature of approximately 4 \u00b0C. The brains were then carefully removed from the skulls and post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB at 4 \u00b0C. Each brain was then frozen in crushed dry ice and sectioned into 50 \u03bcm thick serial coronal sections on a freezing microtome. A one in six series of sections, cut at 50 \u03bcm thickness in the coronal plane, was made for Nissl substance, myelin, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT) and orexin-A (hypocretin/OxA) staining. Sections used for the Nissl series were mounted on 0.5% gelatine-coated glass slides, cleared in a solution of 1:1 chloroform and absolute alcohol, then stained in 1% cresyl violet to reveal cell bodies. Myelin sections were first stored in 5% formalin for two weeks at 4 \u00b0C then mounted on 1.5% gelatine-coated slides and subsequently stained with silver solution to reveal myelin sheaths (Gallyas, 1979).",

Sections were then preincubated for 2 h, at room temperature, in blocking buffer (containing 3% normal goat serum for the TH, 5-HT and OxA sections or 3% normal rabbit serum for the ChAT sections, plus 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton-X in 0.1 M PB). This was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB. The sections were then placed in the primary antibody solution that contained the appropriate diluted primary antibody in blocking buffer for 48 h at 4 \u00b0C under gentle agitation. Anti-choline acetyltransferase (AB144P, Millipore, raised in goat) at a dilution of 1:3000 was used to reveal cholinergic neurons. Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (AB151, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:7500 revealed the catecholaminergic neurons. Serotonergic neurons were revealed using anti-serotonin (AB938, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:7500. Orexinergic neurons were revealed using anti-Orexin A (AB3704, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:3000. This incubation was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB and the sections were then incubated in a secondary antibody solution (1:1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, BA-1000, Vector Labs, for TH, 5-HT and OxA sections, or a 1:1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-goat IgG, BA-5000, Vector Labs, for ChAT sections, in a blocking buffer containing 3% NGS/NRS and 2% BSA in 0.1 M PB) for 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB, after which sections were incubated for 1 h in avidin-biotin solution (at a dilution of 1:125, Vector Labs), followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB. Sections were then placed in a solution of 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 0.1 M PB for 5 min, followed by the addition of 3 \u03bcl of 3% hydrogen peroxide to each 1 ml of solution in which each section was immersed. Chromatic precipitation was visually monitored and verified under a low power stereomicroscope. Staining was continued until such time as the background stain was at a level that would assist architectural reconstruction without obscuring the immunopositive neurons. Development was arrested by placing sections in 0.1 M PB, followed by two more rinses in this solution. Sections were then mounted on 0.5% gelatine coated glass slides, dried overnight, dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols, cleared in xylene and coverslipped with Depex. To test for non-specific staining, the primary antibody or the secondary antibody was omitted in selected section, which resulted in no staining of the tissue.",

The serotonergic neurons forming the B9 nucleus appeared to be a lateral extension of the most ventral portion of CLi (Fig. 5A). The predominantly bipolar 5HT+ B9 neurons were found in a moderate to high density and extended as an arc of neurons into the ventrolateral portion of the midbrain tegmentum with cell density increasing caudally. The median raphe nucleus (MnR) was characterized by two distinct, densely packed 5HT+ neuronal columns on either side of the midline in a para-raphe position, extending from the level of the oculomotor nucleus to the anterior portion of the pons. The dendrites of mostly bipolar MnR neurons were oriented in a dorsoventral plane. In the ring-tailed lemur, the columns of the MnR expanded laterally along the ventral border of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a feature not observed in the other two species.",

These six nuclei were found, for the most part, within the periaqueductal and periventricular grey matter from the level of the oculomotor nucleus to the trigeminal motor nucleus and contained bipolar and multipolar neurons. Two pararaphe columns of 5HT+ neurons located between the bilaterally paired medial longitudinal fasciculi represent the DRif nucleus in all three species. The DRv was found immediately dorsal to the DRif, within the periaqueductal grey matter, and was represented by a high density of 5HT+ neurons. Immediately dorsal to DRv, between it and the ventral border of the cerebral aqueduct, a high-density cluster of bipolar 5HT+ neurons was designated as the DRd nucleus. A moderate density of larger, multipolar 5HT+ neurons representing the DRp, was located in the ventrolateral portion of the periaqueductal grey matter. A small number of DRp neurons was found in the adjacent midbrain tegmentum, outside the periaqueductal grey matter, and these were the only neurons of the dorsal raphe complex found external to the central grey matter. The larger, multipolar 5HT+ neurons of the DRl were located dorsolateral to the DRd forming clear aggregations along the edges of the cerebral aqueduct with a low to moderate density. Caudal to DRl, where the cerebral aqueduct opened into the fourth ventricle and the DRd, DRv and DRif disappeared, the neurons of the DRl formed an arc of 5HT+ neurons across the midline of the dorsal portion of the periventricular grey matter, and this represents the DRc nucleus. The neurons of the DRc evinced a similar morphology to those of the DRl and DRp (Fig. 5C).",

The RMg was observed to be two columns of loosely aggregated moderate to large 5HT+ neurons, with dendrites oriented dorsoventrally, on either side of the midline from the level of the trigeminal motor nucleus to the nucleus ambiguus. Appearing at the same level as RMg within the left and right ventrolateral medullary tegmentum, a distinct anteroposterior column of 5HT+ neurons was found, the rostral and caudal ventrolateral serotonergic columns. The RVL began as a ventrolateral continuation of 5HT+ neurons from the lower portion of the RMg extending over the pyramidal tracts and lateral to the inferior olivary complex. The inferior olivary complex topologically distinguishes left and right RVL, and at the approximate level of nucleus ambiguus the RVL becomes the CVL. The CVL continues in the caudal ventrolateral medullary tegmentum until the spinomedullary junction is reached. The neurons of the RVL and CVL exhibited a similar morphology to those of the RMg. The 5HT+ neurons forming the RPa nucleus were found in the ventral midline of the medulla associated with the pyramidal tracts. These bipolar neurons were for the most part located between the two pyramidal tracts in a tightly packed bundle. Two loosely arranged bilateral columns of large, multipolar 5HT+ neurons located on each side of the midline from the level of the nucleus ambiguus to the spinomedullary junction were classified as the ROb.",

The main cluster (Mc) was identified as a large group of moderately densely packed OxA+ neurons located lateral to the third ventricle in the perifornical region of the hypothalamus, with a moderate number of neuronal cell bodies extending medially from this area into the dorsomedial hypothalamus. From the main cluster a group of OxA+ neurons extended laterally into the dorsolateral hypothalamus, with some cells found just outside of the hypothalamus in the region of the zona incerta. This zona incerta cluster (Zic) had a moderate density of OxA+ neurons with dendrites oriented in the mediolateral plane. The third cluster, the optic tract cluster (Otc), extended ventrolaterally from the main cluster to the ventrolateral region of the hypothalamus adjacent to the optic tract. The Otc contained a low to moderate density of OxA+ neurons that showed no specific dendritic orientation.",

While there can be significant variation in the complement of cholinergic nuclei in the mammalian brain, it can be said that the complement of cholinergic nuclei in strepsirrhine primates likely reflects that of a generalized Eutherian mammal. In the strepsirrhine primates no cholinergic interneurons were observed in the cerebral cortex, as observed in Murid rodents and the hottentot golden mole (e.g. Bhagwandin et al., 2006, Calvey et al., 2013), or in other regions of the brain such as the olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus, superior and inferior colliculi, or cochlear nuclei as seen in some Afrotherians (Pieters et al., 2010, Calvey et al., 2013). As with most other mammals, the parabigeminal nucleus was present in all three strepsirrhines, but as mentioned, this nucleus was not found in four species of microchiropterans (Maseko and Manger, 2007, Kruger et al., 2010a). In addition, the strepsirrhine primates did not exhibit parvocellular cholinergic neurons surrounding the pontine cholinergic nuclei (LDT and PPT) as observed in the rock hyrax (Gravett et al., 2009). Thus, the variance in the complement of cholinergic nuclei does, to an extent, distinguish the primates from several other mammalian lineages, but does not specifically align them with the megachiropterans; however, it does not argue against such an alignment, and the complement of cholinergic nuclei does serve to distinguish the megachiropterans from the microchiropterans.",

            "text": "For the most part, the complement of nuclei identified as belonging to the catecholaminergic system in the strepsirrhines studied was similar to that observed in most eutherian mammals (Dell et al., 2010, Calvey et al., 2013); however, one feature of the catecholaminergic system, the presence of the locus coeruleus compact division (A6c) specifically aligns the primates with the megachiropterans to the exclusion of all other mammals, including the microchiropterans (Maseko and Manger, 2007, Kruger et al., 2010a). Thus, in primates and megachiropterans, the locus coeruleus has a distinct core (which we term A6c) region of densely packed tyrosine hyodroxylase immunoreactive neurons, surrounded by a shell of less densely packed neurons (which we term A6d). In most other mammals, the core region (A6c) is absent, and the neurons of the locus coeruleus are less densely packed (e.g. Dell et al., 2010, Calvey et al., 2013). The one group of possible exceptions to this distinguishing and aligning feature of primates and megachiropterans are the murid rodents. In murid rodents, the A6 region is seen as a very densely packed core of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons (Dahlstr\u00f6m and Fuxe, 1964, Kruger et al., 2012); however, in all other rodents previously studied, including bathyergid mole rats, the greater cane rat, the African porcupine and the Highveld gerbil (Da Silva et al., 2006, Moon et al., 2007, Dwarika et al., 2008, Bhagwandin et al., 2008, Limacher et al., 2008), the A6 region presents as a more loosely packed cluster of tyrosine immunoreactive neurons and has been classified as the diffuse portion of the locus coeruleus complex (A6d). It is therefore likely that the compact appearance of the locus coeruleus in murid rodents is not a feature shared with primates and megachiropterans (and therefore lost in all other rodent species) and is an apomorphy specific to the murid rodents (Kruger et al., 2012). The cholinergic cortical neurons are a second murid rodent specific feature of the systems investigated (Bhagwandin et al., 2006, Kruger et al., 2012). In this sense, the compact locus coeruleus and the cortical cholinergic interneurons are likely to have evolved specifically within the murid rodent lineage, and do not affect the concluded alignment of the megachiropterans with the primates to the exclusion of all other mammals. The appearance of the compact portion of the locus coeruleus is a specific character creating the exclusive megachiropteran\u2013primate phylogenetic link, although it might be argued that this character could have evolved in parallel in both lineages. Studies of other Euarchontoglires, such as hares and rabbits, tree shrews and the colugos (or flying lemurs) will determine whether this feature evolved independently in the megachiropteran and primate lineages, or whether it was inherited from a common megachiropteran\u2013primate ancestor. The locus coeruleus is the main site for noradrenalin production in the brain and is involved in alterness/arousal as well as in the optimization of task performance and consolidation of long-term memories (Smeets and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2000, Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005). To our knowledge, there are no specific behavioural or neural processing differences in the megachiropterans and primates compared to other mammals that would explain the presence of this exceptional arrangement of the locus coeruleus, but future studies may reveal differences related to this neural specialization. In addition to the presence of the A6c in the megachiropterans and primates, the absence of the A4 nucleus, the incipient nature of the A9v and the absence of the A15d nucleus in microchiropterans (Maseko and Manger, 2007, Kruger et al., 2010a), serve to distinguish the microchiropterans from both the megachiropterans and primates, and aligns them with the Soricidae. Thus, the variance in the nuclear complement of the catecholaminergic system strongly supports the hypothesis of chiropteran diphyly, and moreover, supports both the megachiropteran\u2013primate and the microchiropteran-Soricidae phylogenetic relationships.",

Variances in the nuclear complement of the serotonergic system have been observed in monotremes and marsupials, with the presence of hypothalamic serotonergic neurons, the lack of the caudal division of the dorsal raphe nuclear complex in the monotremes (Manger et al., 2002c), and the absence of the caudal ventrolateral serotonergic group in marsupials (Patzke et al., 2014). Although the three strepsirrhines possessed all serotonergic nuclei common to primates, and indeed all Eutherian mammals studied to date (Dell et al., 2010; Maseko et al., 2013; Calvey et al., 2013), the presence of a relatively large and clearly expressed lateral division of the dorsal raphe, a feature common to previously studied haplorhines as well as megachiropterans (Dell et al., 2010) may have some functional effect on the inhibition of REM sleep (Monti, 2011). Thus, the qualitative enlargement of a single nucleus of the serotonergic system appears to align the megachiropterans with the primates. This is a tenuous link that needs to be investigated in more detail, perhaps using quantitative stereological and allometric approaches.",

The one main exception of relevance to the problem of chiropteran phylogeny is the absence of the optic tract cluster of orexinergic neurons in the microchiropterans (Kruger et al., 2010b). This feature distinguishes the microchiropterans from all other mammals, including megachiropterans (Dell et al., 2013) and supports the hypothesis of chiropteran diphyly.

            "text": "The present study clearly demonstrates that the organization, number and complement of nuclei belonging to the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems in strepsirrhine primates is identical to that observed in the haplorhines, including humans. Thus, as proposed previously (Manger, 2005), there is a distinct primate order organization of the nuclei belonging these systems. While for the most part these nuclei are commonly found across many mammals (Dell et al., 2010, Calvey et al., 2013), the only species that share with primates the same full complement of nuclei are the megachiropterans. Of the 73 neural characters identified in strepsirrhine and haplorhine primates and in megachiropterans, only one specific feature links these species to the exclusion of all other mammals (although 5 characters distinguish the microchiropterans from the megachiropterans, see Table 1). When this neural characteristic (the presence of a compact portion of the locus coeruleus complex, A6c) is added to the extensive suite of neural features listed by Pettigrew et al. (1989) that links the megachiropterans to primates to the exclusion of the microchiropterans, as well as to the non-neural features supporting the megachiropteran\u2013primate phylogenetic link, the data in favour of chiropteran diphyly and the relationship between megachiropterans and primates becomes well supported. There is also a sense in which the present data linking megachiropterans to primates are complementary, rather than mere additions. Martin (1986) dismissed this phylogenetic link by proposing convergent evolution of the midbrain visual trait, with independent evolution of this trait in both primates and megachiropterans under selection for visually directed behaviour in the \u201cfine branch niche\u201d. Whatever one thinks about the possibility of a megachiropteran manipulating such a niche, the present findings of completely non-visual features that link megachiropterans to primates refutes Martin's proposal of convergent evolution and broadens the conceptual basis of the \u201cflying primate\u201d hypothesis. While clearly more work is required to substantiate this proposed phylogenetic assignation, when considering the data that have been generated so far, the megachiropteran\u2013primate link appears to be more parsimonious than chiropteran monophyly.",

            "text": "The extensive similarities of the neuromodulatory systems of megachiropterans and primates may be of importance for the translation of studies of animal models to the study of human mental function and dysfunction and human health in general. As a specific example, the locus coeruleus complex is of interest. Murid rodents, the most commonly used mammalian animal model (Manger et al., 2008), have what is likely to be an independently evolved structure of the locus coeruleus, while that of the megachiropterans and primates is more likely to be the result of a shared ancestry. The locus coeruleus complex is involved in many important neural functions, and the possibility that the compact and diffuse divisions of this complex are features specific and unique to the megachiropterans and primates, to the exclusion of rodents and all other mammals, cannot be ignored. The locus coeruleus optimizes task performance by incorporating cortical mechanisms involved in the evaluation of costs and benefits associated with task performance (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005). It also plays a very important role in mediating the sleep/wake cycle and may in fact be a primary factor that differentiates REM sleep from wakefulness (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005). This has important implications for human mental health, considering the well-known link between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders. For example, 80\u201390% of people suffering from depression have impaired sleep quality with insomnia increasing the risk for depression, anxiety and substance abuse (Smith and Aston-Jones, 2008). The severity of sleep disturbances correlates with the severity of the psychiatric disorder (Smith and Aston-Jones, 2008). In depression and mania, there is a total increase in the percentage of REM sleep as a function of total sleep time, and it is suggested that REM sleep is disinhibited in depression, narcolepsy and schizophrenia (Smith and Aston-Jones, 2008). The locus coeruleus complex plays a major role in mediating sleep cycles (Siegel, 2004). It is therefore likely that a megachiropteran would provide a more realistic animal model for the translation of relevant psychiatric testing to human when compared to the popular rat model. In addition, there is quite a gap between the visual organization of the primate brain and that of all other mammals, except megachiropterans. Understanding that phylogenetic gap, which includes complex thalamic lamination and new cortical areas, as well as the hemi-decussated retinotectal pathway, requires a closer intermediate than a rodent, tree shrew or carnivore, a role that could be fulfilled by a megachiropteran sister to primates. In addition, both megachiropteran and microchiropteran bats can carry, with apparent impunity, a large number of viruses that are lethal to humans, such as Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both kinds of chiropterans appear to have independently evolved more elaborate and more complex immune systems to deal with the increased cellular damage brought about by the load of reactive oxygen species that accompanies powered flight (Zhang et al., 2013). A consequence of the increased immunity may be impunity to many viruses. These observations are relevant to the conclusion that the two kinds of bats have separate, independent lineages, as the cellular and molecular mechanisms that provide the increased power and scope of their immune systems are also different in the way that they produce this outcome in the two kinds of bats (Zhang et al., 2013). Understanding how the chiropteran immune systems enable them to evade these viruses therefore involves an understanding of how the different megachiropteran and microchiropteran immune systems have each evolved to produce an independent but more powerful outcome in each case. While at this stage, the applicability of the megachiropterans as improved animal models of specific human mental functions and dysfunctions and general human health over murid rodents is still speculative, the data being generated in this and other comparative neurological studies, indicate that the megachiropterans might be a fruitful animal model to be employed in future studies of human mental dysfunction, general health and primate brain evolution. For these, and many other reasons, understanding chiropteran phylogeny is of more than just scientific interest.",
