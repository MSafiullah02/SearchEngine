The emergence of the new or newly recognized pathogens, such as the viruses causing novel viral hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, and highly pathogenic modified strains of influenza virus, has altered the entire insight of public health. There is also increasing awareness of the potential for novel or established infections of animals to cross the species barrier and affect man, such as the avian flu and swine flu. Many old infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, have become renascent due to relaxation of control measures as a result of satisfaction, increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents, and social factors that include increased travel, social displacement and poverty [2] . Some long established infections have expanded to previously unaffected regions, for example, West Nile virus in North America. The threat of bioterrorism has raised the spectra of new outbreaks of highly infectious and deadly diseases, such as smallpox, anthrax, prion diseases such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and plague. There is now some evidence that global climate change might be contributing to the spread of infectious disease [3] . Unless controlled effectively, emerging infectious diseases will take a heavy toll of human life regardless of age, gender, lifestyle, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status.",

Vaccines work by presenting an antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response that improves the body resistance to the effects of an infectious pathogen or a disease process [4] . Receiving a vaccination (antigen) activates the immune system's \"memory\" allowing the body to react quickly by releasing antibodies to future exposures and thereby destroying the pathogen before it can cause illness ( Fig. 16.1) . Antibodies, which are also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are gamma globulin proteins found in blood and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize bacteria and viruses.",

            "text": "Most of the vaccines used today involve killed or attenuated microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) or chemically detoxified toxins (toxoids) from bacteria. However, despite the efficacy of killed and attenuated vaccines, there is concern over their safety. Killed bacterial or viral vaccines often have residual toxicity following inactivation and might contain toxic components, such as lipopolysaccharide [5] . To overcome this problem, although often less immunogenic, subunit vaccines composed of purified antigenic components of the microorganism have been developed. Extensive research has been carried out to also identify the antigens expressed on microorganisms that evoke a protective immune response. Recombinant vaccines have been developed, in which genes for desired antigens are inserted into a vector, usually a virus, which has a very low virulence. The vector expressing the antigen may be used as the vaccine, or the antigen may be purified and injected as a subunit vaccine [6] . Among the subunit recombinant vaccines currently available on the market are the Hepatitis DNA vaccines based on the injection of plasmid DNA encoding the protective antigenic protein have also been investigated [7] [8] [9] . The USDA (US Department of Agriculture) recently granted full licensure for a therapeutic DNA vaccine to help extend survival time of dogs with oral melanoma. The first and only USDA approved vaccine, Oncept\u2122, developed by Merial in partnership with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Animal Medical Center of New York, uses a DNA plasmid containing a gene for the human version of tyrosinase, a protein present on melanoma cancer cells in humans and dogs [10] . For the subunit and DNA vaccines to reach their full potential, it is important to get them to the right place, at the right time, in the right condition [11] . Therefore, delivery systems for vaccines need to be advanced and innovative as well. A successful vaccine formulation must be effective; in other words, it should be capable of inducing appropriate immune response; it should be safe to administer and should be stable, reproducible, and easily affordable.",

Thiomersal (also known as thimerosal; mercurothiolate and sodium 2ethylmercuriothio-benzoate), which is approximately 50% mercury by weight, is one of the most commonly used preservatives in vaccine formulations. It has also been used during vaccine production both to inactivate certain organisms and toxins and to maintain a sterile production line. Recently, there have been some concerns about the safety of this compound due to its mercury content. Such safety concerns have led to initiatives in some countries to eliminate, reduce, or replace thiomersal in vaccines, both in single dose and multidose presentations. However, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety [30] continues to recommend the use of vaccines containing thiomersal for global immunization programmes because the benefits of using such products far outweigh any theoretical risk of toxicity.",

This approach is very important since all vaccines lose potency over time if exposed to heat and/or when frozen [31] .

However, over the past few years, the use of the intradermal administration as an alternative delivery route for several other vaccines including hepatitis B (HBV), measles, and influenza has attracted attention due to the possible advantages it offers compared to the intramuscular and subcutaneous routes.

All of these concerns lead to the search for alternate, noninvasive means of vaccine delivery that do not require a needle and syringe.

Also there is still an inconsistency in the literature about the differential uptake of nanoparticles by antigen presenting cells (APCs), which changes according to the particle and antigen properties as well as the application route.

Plants are used as recombinant biofactories to express a number of vaccines [72] . Plant derived vaccine antigens have been found to be safe and induce a sufficiently high immune response in humans. Hence transgenic plants, including edible plant parts, have been suggested as excellent alternatives for the production of vaccines and economic scaleup through cultivation [73] . Such edible encapsulation protects the antigen through the mucosal and gut systems to allow its uptake. Furthermore, oral plant based vaccines are reported to be stable during storage at ambient temperatures, thereby eliminating the need for a cold chain. In addition, they do not require syringes, needles, or trained personnel for administration [74] . These features also favor use of these vaccines for large scale immunization programmes, particularly in developing countries where resources to provide a cold chain and the equipment and personnel needed for injections are limited. Initially the transgenic fruit or vegetable expressing an antigen from a virus or bacteria as the edible vaccine was intended to be eaten raw without any processing to evoke the protective immune response against a particular disease. However, recently the approach to \"edible vaccines\" has been replaced by \"plant-derived vaccine antigens.\" This approach results in the antigen in a pure form and at standardized concentrations [73] . In general plants with high food value are being chosen as expression systems such as apple, banana, tomato, and guava (fruits), peanut, corn, soybean, and chickpea (seeds), cabbage, lettuce, potato, and spinach (vegetables) [73] . Recently, a rice based mucosal vaccine expressing CT-B (MucoRice CT-B) has been reported as a new possible form of oral cholera vaccine [75] . Transgenic rice has been shown to be stable in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract, also eliminating the need for syringe/needle administration as well as the cold chain storage process, and providing physicochemical stability. However, it has been pointed out that a highly sophisticated and a closed soil-less farming facility with artificial sunlight would be required for technical advancement of the rice based transgenic vaccine system.",
