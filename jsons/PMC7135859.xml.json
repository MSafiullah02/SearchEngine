The availability of this level of genetic information has spawned the terms functional genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and even metabonomics. These fields of study describe the large-scale applications of global gene expression profiling, protein analysis, and metabolite analysis. In each case, powerful bioinformatics tools with links to the comprehensive databases are essential to drive the process. This review focuses on the role that gene expression profiling has begun to play in clinical microbiology and discusses potentials for pathogen identification, pathogen discovery, and novel therapeutics discovery. The availability of complete microbial genomes continues to grow rapidly. Some of the more than 200 different complete pathogen genomes and the dates they became available are listed in Table 1. Links to these and other complete microbial genomes, partial sequences, and ongoing pathogen-related genomic projects are available on the web site for The Institute for Genomic Research at http://www.tigr.org.",

Total RNA is extracted from the control and experimental conditions of interest. Arbitrary primer pairs are used in an RT-PCR-based reaction for each condition, generating a differential display of signal intensities seen side by side. Signals of interest, such as an amplicon band that appears induced or upregulated, are cut from the gel, eluted, and re-amplified. To confirm differential expression, the amplicon is labeled and used as a probe on a Northern blot. Once confirmed, the amplicon is sequenced. While this sounds very inefficient given today's technology, it does offer the unique potential for novel gene discovery. In fact, in 2001, Van den Hoogen et al. (7) identified the first human metapneumovirus genetic sequences using this technology. They studied RNA extracts from cells that appeared to exhibit respiratory syncytial virus-like cytopathic effects but that could not be confirmed to contain any previously known human virus. Human metapneumovirus is now a well-recognized cause of acute respiratory tract infections.\n",

Macroarrays are membranes imprinted with hundreds of cDNA probes, usually consisting of a thematic element, such as genes associated with inflammation. The technique used is familiar, and the number of genes evaluated is targeted, but somewhat limited. Analysis and interpretation of macroarray results is accomplished using standard protocols. This technique offers no potential for novel gene discovery because the probes included on the membrane are of known sequences. The concept of depositing multiple DNA spots representing different genes onto a membrane surface is not new, especially in microbiology. More than 10 years ago, Chuang et al.

The array is washed, stained, and scanned into a database. The scanned images are compared to replicates of data generated from other samples or to samples derived from different experimental conditions of interest. Following rigorous validation, statistical algorithms are applied to determine which genes are expressed. Normalization of expression data per gene and/or per chip allows relative gene expression intensities to be compared across the different experimental conditions.

The need for genome-wide approaches to gene expression experiments becomes apparent when one considers that the genome sequence of E. coli has been in hand for more than 6 years, but the microbe still contains over 1,000 genes of unknown function. The role of such genes will not be discovered without application of functional genomic technologies combined with creative experiments. Functional genomics allows researchers to make new and unexpected links between the functions of unrelated and hitherto uncharacterized genes and to put forth hypotheses that can be subsequently tested by more traditional methods.",

Their array was used as a framework for the genomic analysis of BCG strains by hybridizing with labeled genomic DNA. The study documented 16 regions that were deleted in BCG strains compared to M. tuberculosis strains, ranging from ~1,900 bases to almost 13,000 bases. Of particular interest were nine regions that represented 61 open reading frames that were present in M. tuberculosis, but consistently absent from M. bovis strains, including BCG.

The known mechanism of action of isoniazid is a selective interruption of mycolic acid synthesis. This study served as a model experiment for looking at inhibitors of an essential metabolic pathway by expression profiling. Several genes encoding mycolic acid biosynthetic enzymes were upregulated following isoniazid challenge, both upstream and downstream of the known site of action of the drug. It has been suggested that accumulation of upstream metabolites and depletion of downstream metabolites serve as signals for induction of gene expression. In addition, several genes not known to be involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis were induced, potentially identifying linked pathways that previously had not been appreciated to be interrelated.",

The host responds through a series of events, including secretion of mediators, cell-to-cell interactions, and a cascade of inflammatory events in the infected cells. The recruited inflammatory cells also undergo changes in gene expression signatures, again characteristic for an offending pathogen.

One of the receptor-ligand pairs that we found to be highly upregulated was macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) and its primary receptor, chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1). Using this information, we went on to study the impact of interrupting this pathway on pneumovirus-associated inflammation, demonstrating the absolute requirement for MIP-1\u03b1 signaling in pneumovirus-associated inflammation (14, 15). Clinical studies in infants infected with the human pneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, have confirmed a direct correlation between bronchoalveolar lavage concentrations of MIP-1\u03b1 and clinical disease severity in humans (16, 17).
