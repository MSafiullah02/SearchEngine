            "text": "Experimental evidence shows that both IMPase and IPPase, which are members of a group of at least four magnesium-dependent phosphomonoesterases, are significantly inhibited at therapeutic serum concentrations of lithium (0.6\u20131.2 mM/l) (Quiroz et al. 2004). Inositol is the essential substrate for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), from which PI(4,5) biphosphate (P2) is produced (Yu and Greenberg 2016). With the receptor-mediated activation of the phospholipase C (PLC), PI(4,5)P2 is cleaved to form inositol-1,4,5-triphosphates (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) (Streb et al. 1983). The IP3 can be either recycled to myo-inositol by a series of dephosphorylations catalysed by IPPase and IMPase or, alternatively, can be phosphorylated sequentially to form IP4, IP5, IP6, IP7 and IP8 by a series of kinases, including the inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK) (Balla 2013; Wei et al. 2018; Yu and Greenberg 2016). The depletion of myoinositol determined by the lithium-induced inhibition of IMPase and IPPase, could in turn provoke the dampening of PI signalling with decreased downstream levels of inositol phosphates. Although experimental data suggest that long-term, rather than short-term, lithium exposure can dampen PI signalling (Wei et al. 2018), this molecular effect if of great interest in terms of potential antiviral effects. Indeed, IP6 appears to be a key factor in substantially increasing the viral stability of HIV, an RNA virus, facilitating the accumulation of newly synthesized DNA inside the capsid (Mallery et al. 2018). It is conceivable that decreased levels of IP6 would decrease the ability of HIV of replicating effectively.",

The beneficial effect of lithium on autophagy has been demonstrated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington\u2019s disease (Sarkar et al. 2005) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Fornai et al. 2008) and it appears to be mediated through its modulatory effects on GSK-3\u03b2 and IMPase (Motoi et al. 2014). As several DNA and RNA viruses are able to inhibit the autophagy pathway to increase their survival (Mehrbod et al. 2019), this molecular effect of lithium may decrease the chance of the viruses\u2019 survival.",

In fact, the inhibition of GSK-3\u00df during the later stages of infection with Dengue virus-2 (DENV-2), an RNA virus, resulted in a reduction of viral titres in hepatocarcinoma cell (Huh-7) and Vero cell lines (Cuartas-L\u00f3pez and Gallego-G\u00f3mez 2020).

In the long term, however, the use of lithium has been significantly associated with a normalization of cytokine levels, balancing the disruptions observed in BD patients (Van Den Ameele et al. 2016). Therefore, lithium exerts a combined action that involves multiple pathways. This discloses different potential applications of lithium which remain largely unexplored (Chiu et al. 2013).",

The only therapeutic strategies currently available are those applied in intensive care units, i.e. using anti-inflammatory agents and anticoagulants to prevent the respiratory insufficiency and the vasculitis. Some antiviral agents, namely the recently FDA-approved remdesivir, help the viral elimination although conclusive evidence on its efficacy is still lacking (Grein et al. 2020; Ledford 2020). In addition, almost all countries have suggested or disposed lockdown measures able to tackle down the spread of the infection such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation (Baden and Rubin 2020), all presenting major challenges and limitations (Niud and Xu 2020). The development of a vaccine represents the ideal therapeutic approach to the CoViD-19 pandemic, but despite some progress it can be still lengthy. At the moment, symptomatic approaches to the infection and its complications, combined with re-purposing of therapeutic options already available for other conditions, are two main areas of action against this viral pandemic (Lu 2020).",

In addition, lithium was first shown to inhibit the replication of type 1 and type 2 HSV at concentrations of 5 mM/l and of the pseudorabies and vaccinia viruses (Skinner et al. 1980). This effect extended also to pseudorabies and vaccinia virus (Skinner et al. 1980). Further support was provided for the in vitro antiviral activity of lithium on HSV in Vero cells and rabbit (Trousdale et al. 1984). However, the same authors were unable to detect a reduction in the reactivation of latent infection in rabbits (Trousdale et al. 1984).",

The maximum effect was obtained by a 1-h treatment with 10 mM/l lithium chloride, preceding viral infection by 19\u201324 h (Cernescu et al. 1988). Further, they showed that intermittent treatment with 10 mM lithium chloride of cultures persistently infected with measles or HSV obtained from human myeloid K-562 cell line showed a reduction in the extracellular virus yield (Cernescu et al. 1988). Of interest, lithium not only reduced vital replication, but also restored the synthesis of almost all host-cell proteins, including fibronectin, type IV collagen, thrombospondin (TSP) and proteoglycans, which is typically suppressed by HSV (Ziaie and Kefalides 1989). Again, lithium was more effective at the higher concentration (30 mM/l) and when the compound was added to the culture at the time of infection rather than after adsorption of HSV (Ziaie and Kefalides 1989).",

Indeed, lithium chloride at 30 mM suppressed the synthesis of viral polypeptides, whereas the synthesis of host proteins was maintained. In particular, the mRNAs for viral proteins, including the DNA polymerase, were nearly undetectable when lithium was added with the virus to the endothelial cell cultures infected with HSV-1 (Ziaie et al. 1994).",

(2007) tested the effect of lithium chloride on the replication of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in cell culture using two model cell types: Vero cells, an African Green monkey kidney-derived epithelial cell line, and DF-1 cells, an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (Harrison et al. 2007). When treated with a range of lithium chloride concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25 or 50 mM/l), IBV RNA and protein levels, as well as viral progeny production were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types, with data indicating that the inhibition was determined by a cellular, by inhibiting RNA synthesis, rather than a virucidal effect (Harrison et al. 2007), an effect also confirmed in a subsequent study by Li et al. (2009) (Li et al. 2009). Furthermore, in Vero cells, lithium chloride showed effectiveness in suppressing infection of the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus by inhibiting of the virus entry, replication and apoptosis (Li et al. 2018). In type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus lithium chloride reduced RNA production and protein transduction (Cui et al. 2015). Furthermore, lithium chloride at concentrations of 10\u201360 mM significantly inhibited viral replication of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in porcine kidney cells (LLC-PK1) compared to mock-treated cells (Zhai et al. 2019). The antiviral effects of lithium chloride occurred at the early stage of PDCoV replication, and was associated to the inhibition of the PDCoV-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells (Zhai et al. 2019). Finally, lithium chloride showed in vitro ability to limit both early and late stages of infection and to inhibit apoptosis in another porcine coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis (Ren et al. 2011).",

A retrospective study followed (Amsterdam et al. 1990), including a total of 263 patients. Of them, 177 subjects received lithium carbonate prophylaxis, while a comparison group of 59 subjects received antidepressant monotherapy for a major affective disorder. Overall, 90 out of 236 subjects reported the presence of recurrent labial herpes infections, 63/177 (36%) on lithium and 27/59 (46%) on antidepressants with not statistically significant difference in the rates. However, the mean pre-treatment recurrence rate for labial herpes infections (1.6 \u00b1 2.6/year) significantly decreased during treatment (0.8 + 1.8/year, p < 0.001). In contrast, the same recurrence rates showed no significant changes in antidepressant-treated patients (Amsterdam et al. 1990). Of note, the reduction of HSV recurrences was higher in patients with lithium concentrations \u2265 0.65 mmol/l than in those with lower concentration (respectively, 70% vs. 54%) and with erythrocyte lithium levels \u2265 0.35 mmol/l than patients with lower concentrations (respectively, 81% vs. 49%) (Rybakowski and Amsterdam 1991). Afterwards, the Polish arm (28 patients) of the previous study was followed-up in an uncontrolled prospective report to further study the prophylactic effect of lithium carbonate against HSV recurrences (Rybakowski et al. 1996). The observed reduction of HSV recurrences did not correlate with lithium concentrations in serum or erythrocytes.",

The aim of the proof-of-concept study was to study the effect of lithium on HIV-1 expression and reservoir size in the CD4\u00fe T cells of virologically suppressed patients. Mean time from HIV-1 diagnosis was 10.7 \u00b1 6.5 years, and the mean time of sustained virological suppression was 5.3 \u00b1 3.4 years. Patients started with an initial lithium carbonate dose of 400 mg/day and lithium blood levels of 0.4\u20130.8 mmol/l. At week 2, cell-associated HIV-1 RNA transcripts decreased in 5 of 6 patients. At week 4, the reduction in viral transcription levels was of 40%. Of note, viral transcription later increased so that at week 12 of treatment all patients recovered their initial transcription pattern. Viremia decreased from 67% at baseline to 44% immediately after beginning lithium, possibly by activation of the \u00df-catenin signalling, but rose to 87% at week 12. These data reflected the patterns of expression of HIV-1 in circulating CD4\u00fe T cells. The proportion of circulating CD4\u00fe T cells harbouring proviral DNA was also measured. At baseline, HIV-1 copies were 1173 per million CD4\u00fe T cells (interquartile range: 388\u20132343) and at week 4, they dropped to 582 copies (373\u20131606), a significant reduction in the size of the proviral reservoir in CD4\u00fe T cells (19% median decrease, p = 0.03), later lost at week 12 (Puertas et al. 2014).",

It is possible that the insufficient proper clinical evidence of the antiviral effects of lithium is a reflection of its status as a drug without strong marketing support. Indeed, after two seminal randomized clinical trials (Amsterdam et al. 1991, 1996), there have been no further investigation of this important property of lithium, although supported by some preclinical evidence summarized in this review.

Whilst the development of a CoViD-19 vaccine is the desired advancement for the control of the pandemic, the growing prevalence of symptomatic CoViD-19 patients calls for a broadening of possible therapeutic options. The development of treatments for CoViD-19 is feasible either by testing known or unknown existing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments (Baden and Rubin 2020), like the recently FDA-approved remdesivir (Grein et al. 2020). Although, the most reasonable step hast to be the development of new, specific compounds, would require a considerable amount of time for the entire drug-development pipeline. Alternatively, repurposing of some drugs marketed with other clinical indications than antiviral, but showing efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 could be a viable option. Lithium may have a relevant role in this scenario.",

In addition, further support, although indirect, for the role of lithium appears to come from advanced analysis combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target SARS-CoV-2, and particularly its main protease Mpro, which is an essential component for viral replication (Jin et al. 2020). Indeed, this study showed that ebselen, a lithium mimetic agent (Singh et al. 2013), determined an enzymatic inhibition of the protease Mpro activity, a finding further substantiated the in vitro observation of a strong antiviral effect at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM in CoViD-19 virus infected Vero cells (Jin et al. 2020). This appears relevant given that ebselen shares a distinct molecular mechanism with lithium, namely the inhibition of IMPase (with consequent dampening of PI signalling) which induces lithium-like effects on mouse behaviour, reversed by inositol (Pisanu et al. 2016; Singh et al. 2013).",

Among them, regulatory requirements which underwent an attempt to harmonize between national and federal medication agencies dating as back as 2007 (Mariz et al. 2016). Furthermore, the need for medical plausibility as well as for a solid scientific rationale, both at pre-clinical and clinical level, needs to combine with complex safety/surveillance monitoring, which may benefit from large, structured and integrated nationwide data sources (Crisafulli et al. 2019). Lithium\u2019s safety and tolerability profile is a major concern in clinical practice, and its narrow therapeutic window needs accurate monitoring to optimize its effectiveness as well as increase treatment adherence (Nolen et al. 2019). Experimental data show that viral inhibition starts to occur at very high concentrations of lithium, typically close to the toxicity threshold reported in human pharmacokinetic studies (1.0\u20131.2 mM/l). However, it should be noted that, although the in vitro antiviral effects are more prominent at higher concentrations of lithium, some level of activity is detectable even at lower doses. In addition, it is conceivable that, as previously reported for saliva, specific anatomic compartment can have higher concentrations of lithium than those detectable in serum. Thus, as demonstrated for labial HSV, the normal therapeutic levels could be sufficient to obtain some degree of antiviral efficacy. Furthermore, specific dosage regimens, such as that including the evening loading of lithium, might be more effective in this regard and should be considered in eventual clinical studies.",

In fact, despite lithium treatment for CoViD-19 in the general population seems unlikely, when tailoring a treatment plan for CoViD-19in patients affected by BD, the awareness of lithium\u2019s antiviral effect could optimize the inevitable polypharmacy. Patients affected by BD present increased rated of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, overweight/obesity, hypertension and smoking status compared to the general population (Vancampfort et al. 2015; Vancampfort et al. 2013). Such comorbidities associate with a worse CoViD-19 outcome, both directly with increased in-hospital deaths due complications (Mehra et al. 2020) and indirectly due to worst outcomes when subjected to mechanical ventilation (Mart\u00ednez-Al\u00e9s et al. 2020).",
