The cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its first derivative were employed for this task. The simulations showed that it is almost impossible to predict based on the initial CV-19 cases (1st 2nd or 3rd weeks) how the pandemic will evolve. However, the results presented here revealed that this approach can be used as an alternative for the exponential growth model, traditionally employed as a prediction model, and serve as a valuable tool for investigating how protective measures are changing the evolution of the pandemic.",

Even though, based on a reasonable mathematical model some scenarios can be drawn and serve as a warning on how the severity of one specific situation can evolve (Biswas and Sen, 2020) . It is well known and observed that as time passes, the number of CV-19 cases experiences a rapid rising followed by stabilization after some time. It presents what is called a step-like function behavior. Frequently, the exponential model of growth is chosen for fitting and forecasting future cases (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Nevertheless, even a good prediction model will start to deviate from the actual data in just a few weeks and, therefore, without any adjustment become useless for this task. The idea of this study is to provide a more realistic growth model of confirmed CV-19 cases to give anyone conditions to promptly evaluate how restrictive mobility actions (as, for instance, social isolation) are changing the virus growing rates.",
