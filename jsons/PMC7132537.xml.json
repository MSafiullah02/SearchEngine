            "text": "Infectious diseases raise a number of difficult ethical issues (for an overview see Francis et al.\n1). For example, tuberculosis (TB) is a major global cause of illness and death. The World Health Organization estimates 1.6 million deaths attributable to TB in 2007, yet major challenges remain with respect to defining \u2018individual obligations to avoid infecting others, coercive social distancing measures, third-party notification, health workers\u2019 duty to treat contagious patients, and international justice.\u20192\nBox 1\nlists some infection control scenarios with ethical considerations.Box 1Some infection control scenarios with ethical considerations\nA.\nAcinetobacter baumannii is isolated from six of the 20 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) over a one-month period. Molecular studies show that this is an indistinguishable strain from one that has caused outbreaks in the ICUs in neighbouring hospitals. Control of the outbreak has required closure of those units for up to two weeks and those closures have taken place in the context of a regional shortage of ICU beds. The lead ICU physician asks if the ICU should be closed to control the outbreak.B.Repeated hand-washing compliance audits for a period of 12 months have shown compliance of 50\u201360% in the care of the elderly wards in a large district general hospital with persistent meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile problems. The chief executive officer asks for information to be collected on the names of staff who fail to comply, so that he can discipline those staff failing to comply at the next audit. How will you respond to this request?C.The eye surgeons in a teaching hospital had noticed an increase in postcataract surgery infection. This had led to closure of the eye theatre for major remedial work to be carried out on a faulty air-handling unit. When the theatre is to be reopened the eye theatre sister asks if the patients who will be operated on should be told of the previous problems, particularly as there is no certainty that the deficiencies in the air-handling plant were sufficient to explain the high infection rate. Do the patients have a right to know?D.The strategic health authority offers your National Health Service trust \u00a3100 000 to \u2018improve infection control\u2019. The head of infection control wants to prioritise rapid methods for the detection of MRSA because of ongoing public concerns with MRSA infection. There are several competing priorities, which include higher than expected death rates from fungal infection in the bone marrow transplant unit, increasing numbers of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infection in the renal unit, and concerns about the adequacy of facilities available for isolation of patients with diarrhoea. How should priorities be decided?E.An elderly man is admitted to an isolation ward following a hernia repair and the development of a postoperative wound infection from which MRSA has been isolated. During his stay in the isolation ward he develops norovirus infection, then C. difficile diarrhoea, and after a protracted stay he dies. The death certificate gives C. difficile as a contributory cause of death. His family ask for justification of the decision to place him in a ward with patients with infectious diarrhoea. How will you respond?\n",

Freedom of movement, privacy, companionship and many other goods are valued by patients, staff and visitors. Frequently, methods for the control of the spread of infection involve constraints on individual freedoms, for example through restricting contact with others (isolation), restricting access to education (children in the USA cannot attend school without vaccinations), and restrictions on travel [as happened during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak]. The Public Health (Scotland) Act 2008 gives statutory powers forcing quarantine in their own home on individuals with some types of serious infection and expanded requirements for compulsory notification.4 Both of these powers potentially bring the principles of respect for the individual (autonomy and privacy) into conflict with the greater good (preventing the spread of infection).

Many consider hospital infection control to be a natural extension of control strategies applied in the wider community for the control of spread of infectious diseases.

The HPA has taken a substantial role in overseeing the surveillance and strategic direction of infection control in National Health Service (NHS) trusts. The HPA website describes its function as \u2018to protect the community (or any part of the community) against infectious diseases and other dangers to health.\u2019 The HPA acknowledges that \u2018decision makers must balance individual freedom against the common good, fear for personal safety against the duty to treat the sick, and short term economic losses against the wider implications of the potential spread of serious diseases\u2019, but it says little about the principles to be used in balancing these requirements. More detailed guidelines have been produced by the US Public Health Leadership Society, by other recent reports, and by a number of books, some of which have proposed a change in the definition and emphasis of public health.9, 10, 11, 12\n",

Some are already at the margins of a minimum capability to function and these individuals are particularly vulnerable to falling below a minimum threshold following HCAI. Some individuals (such as infants undergoing intensive care) in early stages of growth and development may never achieve a full range of capacities to function, and HCAI adds significantly to this burden of reduced capabilities. Low virulence agents of infections may become endemic, and outcomes for patients are more likely to be compromised for those who are infected.

Munthe developed a model for the goals of public health within a European Public Health Network (EuroPHEN) project which was funded by the European Commission.14 Munthe suggested that \u2018The most basic problem \u2026 seems to be the tension between the population perspective of public health and the individualistic perspective of traditional medical ethical notions of autonomy.\u2019 He proposed a population approach to autonomy, and an integrated multidimensional model of public health goals including consideration of autonomy (with respect to health opportunity choices), and equality (of health states and distribution of health opportunities). He proposed an integration of these goals with the traditional goal of public health \u2013 which is the promotion of population health \u2013 into the integrated goal of \u2018the promotion of equal (and real) opportunities of everyone to be more healthy.\u2019 In discussing how this model might work in guiding decision-making in practice, he argues that the relative importance of the traditional goal increases when population health is poorer. As population health rises, further gains in population health could be traded for gains in autonomy and equality. It is difficult to see how this approach could be applied in a hospital context. Levels of health (of hospital patients) are low (otherwise they would not be hospital patients), the capacity for autonomous decision-making may be impaired (because patients are ill), and the consequences of actions taken to control (hospital) population health may have impact not just on autonomy but also on the health of individuals \u2013 for example, on those placed in isolation.",

The application of this principle as a single principle to decision-making in public health is fraught with difficulties and is also potentially self-contradictory.17 Instead the Nuffield Council draw on European Commission advice that decisions based on this principle require integration of at least five dimensions which include risk assessment (including acknowledgements of areas of uncertainty), attention to fairness and consistency, costs and benefits of different course of action, transparency, and proportionality (actions taken should be in proportion to the risk).18 The Nuffield Council refer to this as a precautionary approach. This type of approach (particularly risk assessment, proportionality) will be familiar to many working in hospital infection control even though perhaps not formally defined in this way.",
