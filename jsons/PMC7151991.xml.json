Multiple passages (two to three passes) may be required. A limiting factor is the available cell lines in which the viruses are isolated. Some viruses require specific cell lines as evidenced by bovine coronaviruses.6., 15. BRSV isolation by cell culture is difficult, with reduced success associated with freezing and shipment. Ideally the viruses should cause a visible cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture somewhat unique for the viral family. Yet common viruses such as most BVDVs (>90%) are noncytopathic (NCP), yielding no visible cytopathologic changes in cell culture. The agent preliminarily identified in cell culture requires confirmation by neutralization with monospecific antiserum/monoclonal antibody or primary binding assays with antiserums/monoclonal antibody such as immunoperoxidase, immunohistochemistry (IHC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), fluorescent antibody assays, or immunoelectromicroscopy.",

An acute sample should be collected as early as possible in the course of infection/disease, and the convalescent sample 3 to 4 weeks later. It is appropriate to sample multiple animals from the same group, ideally with samples from both apparently healthy and diseased animals. A rise in antibody titer to the specific virus indicates exposure to that agent. A fourfold rise in antibody titer indicates an active infection when the microtiter virus neutralization (VNT) is used. The VNT in cell culture is routinely used for BHV-1, PI-3V, BRSV, and BVDV antibody testing. Recently some laboratories have incorporated ELISA tests for antibodies. The serologic testing for viral infections is both labor and time consuming. Plus time must evolve to get the acute and convalescent samples. Thus serology is retrospective at best and must be well planned to provide useful information. Often both diagnosticians and clinicians are frustrated when only one sample is available for the disease episode.",

The disease occurs usually after recent additions to a herd, and the virus is transmitted to susceptible cattle.1 The BHV-1 disease usually occurs after the calves have lost their maternal immunity. The disease is most common in cattle over 6 months of age.1 The BHV-1 also survives in cattle recovering from primary infections with latency as a hallmark of the BHV-1 ecology.1., 19. The latent virus may be found in trigeminal and sacral ganglia with recrudescence later by stress or administration of corticosteroids.1., 19. After recrudescence/reactivation, the virus may be detected in nasal secretions with potential spread to contacts. Interestingly there may be an effective primary immune response acquired after natural infection or vaccination to control reexcretion (shedding).19 A secondary immune response boosted by reactivation may also inhibit reexcretion.19 Animals with high antibody BHV-1 titers (neutralizing) before reactivation did not reexcrete virus after reactivation treatment.22 Cattle receiving MLV BHV-1 vaccines may also have latent infections with the vaccinal strains.1., 19. The host immunity to BHV-1 has been extensively studied with both T cells (cell-mediated immunity [CMI]) and B cells (humoral/antibodies) important in recovery and prevention on reexposure.1., 19.\n",

Although a BHV-1 viremia is not easily detected in circulating leukocyte/monocytes, BHV-1 can infect the fetus in susceptible cows/heifers. The BHV-1 likely does not cause a viremia detected by viral isolation of blood leukocytes, but the virus may be detected by PCR in blood leukocytes.19 Abortions can occur up to 100 days after initial infection.1., 7. The fetus is susceptible at any gestational age, yet most abortions occur after the fifth month of pregnancy. Abortions are usually observed at 4 to 8 months' gestation.19 Susceptible females given most parenteral MLV vaccines containing BHV-1 may abort. Clinicians and owners must be aware of label indications because not all MLV BHV-1 vaccines are safe for pregnant female use. Aborted fetuses are usually dead when aborted with blood-tinged pleural and peritoneal fluids. The placental membranes may have to be removed manually. Diagnosis of BHV-1 is difficult in autolyzed fetal material, but when fresh placenta and fetal tissues are available to both histopathology and viral identification, diagnostic attempts can be rewarding. Intranuclear inclusions and focal areas of necrosis in the liver and adrenals are seen in BHV-1 abortions. The virus may be isolated from the placenta, fetal liver, and adrenals. Recently the use of contemporary BHV-1 reagents such as monoclonal antibody and IHC has enhanced BHV-1 abortion diagnosis. Serology using acute serum at time of abortion and a convalescent sample 3 to 4 weeks later in the aborting cow is unrewarding because the initial infection of the dam may have occurred as much as 100 days earlier, and thus she may already have seroconverted. Testing for BHV-1 antibodies in aborted fetuses is not useful because the fetus dies rapidly after infection, precluding immune stimulation with any detectable antibodies.",

Another benefit is their potential to immunize calves that are already seropositive because of maternal (humoral) antibodies passively transferred through the colostrum.39 Animals vaccinated with the MLV intranasal vaccines may transiently shed virus in the nasal secretions and therefore might infect susceptible contact animals.40\n",

An adjuvant is added to the inactivated strain to help stimulate an immune response. Inactivated BHV-1 vaccines require two doses (14-28 days apart) when used for the initial vaccination of susceptible cattle. Historically it has been thought that inactivated vaccines against viruses did not induce as long a duration of immunity as the MLV vaccines, nor did they confer protection against mucosal infections. Controlled studies are required to determine the duration of immunity induced by inactivated BHV-1 vaccines and MLV vaccines, both for respiratory disease and fetal infections. Disadvantages of inactivated vaccines are that the onset of protection may not be as rapid as with MLV parenteral or MLV intranasal vaccines and two doses are required.

Abortions have been reported subsequent to vaccination with MLV parenteral vaccines.35 The MLV vaccine virus may also result in corpus luteum infection or disease. Experimental studies have indicated a reduced conception rate in susceptible cattle that received an MLV parenteral vaccine 3 to 4 days before or 14 days after breeding.43., 44. Clinical observations indicate that susceptible recipients used in embryo transfer (ET) may have delayed estrous after MLV parenteral (BHV-1 and BVDV) vaccine use and synchronization. It has been reported that pregnant cattle raised in contact with calves recently vaccinated with MLV parenteral vaccines had a greater incidence of BHV-1 abortion than those that did not have contact with vaccinates.45 Consequently, the labels of MLV parenteral vaccines have usually stated that the vaccine should not be used in calves nursing pregnant cows. Recent studies, however, have shown that calves given an MLV parenteral vaccine did not shed virus in their nasal secretions nor did contact animals become infected with the vaccine virus.46., 47., 48. Multiple companies have received label claims for MLV vaccines containing BHV-1 and BVDV for pregnant cows provided the cows had received the same line of vaccines with the MLV BHV-1 and BVDV within 12 months and/or before breeding. Likewise, these vaccines could be used in nursing calves if cows previously vaccinated with that line of vaccines according to the label. Veterinarians and producers should follow explicitly the label precautions for the respective vaccine. Another concern is that the MLV vaccine virus may recrudesce, with resulting shedding of virus in cattle either stressed or receiving corticosteroids.49 Realistically, concern about transmission of BHV-1 to animals in contact with those receiving MLV parenteral vaccines would be negligible if the contact animals were properly immunized and immune to BHV-1.",

Also, the challenge may be for only one form of disease, usually the respiratory type. Such challenges may detect only protection against a severe form of the respiratory disease. BHV-1 manifests itself in other forms such as abortions, neonatal disease, genital disease (male and female), and conjunctivitis. Yet little or no data are available about the efficacy of vaccines against these other forms of disease. For example, in one case the genital form of BHV-1 disease (infectious pustular vulvovaginitis) occurred in heifers that had received an MLV parenteral vaccine 5 months earlier.52 Given the lack of duration of immunity studies for all BHV-1 vaccines individually and the cost of vaccines, breeding animals are usually vaccinated at least annually. In some feedyard situations the animals may be revaccinated during the feeding period. It is industry practice that feedlot cattle receive a monovalent BHV-1 MLV parenteral vaccine at reimplant time at approximately 100 days after arrival.

These include subunit vaccines with a portion of the virus, deletion mutants with specific viral genomic fragments deleted, live vectored strains, DNA vaccines using plasmids, and plant-based vaccines. Deletion mutant BHV-1 vaccines as marker vaccines with selected glycoprotein genes deleted along with diagnostic tests for the deleted genes permit identification of vaccinates under control programs.53 Recently needle-free delivery of vaccines has been developed and implemented.53 By high-pressure gas delivery, vaccines may penetrate the skin and be administered intradermally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly.53 Such delivery is designed to minimize damage resulting from intramuscular injections. Two studies compared needle-free intramuscular injection of multivalent MLV vaccine containing BHV-1 with conventional subcutaneous injection via syringe in dairy calves and feedlot cattle.

This paramyxovirus is readily propagated in cell cultures with cytopathology, and it also causes hemagglutination with RBC. Virus neutralization tests and hemagglutination inhibition tests are used for serology.",

Also, BCV immunofluorescence is available to detect BCV antigen. Selected diagnostic laboratories and research units have used PCR to detect BCV in diagnostic samples. Use of electron microscopy could detect BCV in respiratory samples similar to the use of EM for fecal samples. Selected research laboratories have used ELISA tests for BCV antibodies, and in some selected studies they found seroconversions when paired samples were available. Clinicians should consult with their respective diagnostic laboratory for their testing for BCV.",

MD is the result of a PI calf (by definition infected with NCP strain) developing disease (MD) after infection with a CP strain (closely related to the NCP strain). Infection with a CP strain may occur via exposure to CP strains circulating in cattle, but it most likely occurs when the NCP PI strain mutates to form the related CP strain.70 The disease is characterized by severe digestive tract disease with ulcers and erosions throughout the tract, skin lesions, and hoof lesions (interdigital). The disease is uniformly fatal. Concern was that MLV BVDV vaccination may have contributed to MD. However, with such a low PI rate (<1% of cattle entering the feedlot) and almost all cattle at the feedlot receiving the MLV BVDV vaccines, there is an extremely low incidence of MD to support that connection to BVDV vaccine. Also, one study demonstrated that vaccination of PI calves with different MLV vaccines did not induce MD.108\n",

In addition to BVDV, other viral agents could be isolated as well from the nasal swabs. Selected organ tissues collected at necropsy can be used as inoculum for viral isolation. Most BVDV are NCP: thus agent identification in positive cell culture cases is confirmed for BVDV antigen by fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA, or immunoperoxidase staining.

One must consider, however, the potential for maternal antibodies to inhibit the active immune response following vaccination. With the half-life of approximately 23 days, the date the calf responds to vaccination will depend on the quality and quantity of antibodies absorbed.

Vaccinations at pregnancy check for BHV-1 and BVDV have little or no benefit for the fetus, and in some cases, if the dam is susceptible, the fetus may become infected. Ideally vaccination should occur before breeding to maximize protection against fetal infection. USDA-licensed vaccines, both MLV and killed, are used before breeding.27 For the MLV, it is generally recommended that the vaccines be given 30 to 60 days before breeding or exposure to bulls in natural breeding operations. Certain MLV virus vaccines can be used safely in pregnant cows and are labeled as such.27 Generally, these vaccines require vaccination prebreeding and/or within a time frame such as the preceding 12 months. Caution must be given to each vaccine label's inserts for those requirements. The same requirements apply to the vaccination of nursing calves. Some MLV vaccines are approved for nursing calves, but label restrictions should be followed, especially as they relate to the vaccination status of the dam.",

Other cattle operations may wait until weaning for the first dose and give the second dose 3 to 4 weeks later. Industry practices in beef are moving toward MLV vaccines, although some veterinarians and producers elect to use KV vaccines. One approach is to use KV for the first dose followed by MLV.156\n",

The PI animal is the central figure as the principal reservoir exposing susceptible cattle. BVDV disease and its impact on cattle are evident in many management situations, from breeding herd to the stocker and feedlot operations. The emphasis should be to recognize that the BVDV PI begins with infection in the breeding herd. Controlling BVDV fetal infections will reduce and, ideally, eliminate the PI animal. The detection and removal of the PI animal is the goal of BVDV control along with biosecurity and effective vaccination. With the diagnostic tests available to detect PI cattle, BVDV impact on cattle production can be greatly diminished with the removal of these individuals.",
