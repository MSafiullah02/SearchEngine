Thus he was not suspected to be a COVID-19 patient. Eleven days after hospitalization, he accepted the pituitary adenoma resection and had a fever of 38\u2103 after the surgery. Postoperative fever was considered to the cause of the patient's fever. However, five days after the fever onset, the patient had a chest CT scan with typical signs of viral pneumonia. Meanwile, another patient who lived in the same ward had fever, too. Further, several days later, the two patients were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab and transferred to isolation wards. However, during their stay in the department of neurosurgery, especially before the day of the first patient's chest CT scan, HCWs did not have enough personal protective equipment. Sometimes, they weared nursing mask but not the surgical mask, when they contact these two patient, as we did not know that was a COVID-19 patient at None of these 14 infected HCWs were admitted to ICU or dead. One explanation might be that all these HCWs with COVID-19 pneumonia were young people and mild cases. Another explanation might be that our infected HCWs did not had significant underlying chronic diseases. In the largest case series to date of COVID-19 in mainland China(72314 cases, updated February 11, 2020) , no deaths were reported in mild and severe cases. 11 But in critical cases, the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 49.0%. 11 CFR was increased in those with underlying deseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseas, hypertension and cancer. 11 We noticed that IL-6 was significantly elevated in 86% of the infected HCWs and complement C3 was decreased in 57% of them. It indicated that a dysregulated and excessive host inflammatory response may exist in COVID-19 pneumonia. 15 As a multieffective cytokine with anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects, IL-6 plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome of COVID-19 patients. 15 Blocking the signal transduction pathway of IL-6 maybe a promising method for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. 16 A latest small single-centre study has revealed the effectiveness of Tocilizumab (IL-6R blocker) in treating COVID-19 patients. 16 However, multicenter randomized controlled trial is still needed to document the effectiveness of Tocilizumab in COVID-19.",
