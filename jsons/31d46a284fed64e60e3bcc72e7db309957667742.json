Variants of GCN are used in multiple state-of-the-art approaches and therefore it is important to understand the specifics and limitations of GCN-based models. Despite serious efforts, we were not able to fully reproduce the results from the original paper and after a thorough audit of the code provided by authors, we concluded, that their implementation is different from the architecture described in the paper. In addition, several tricks are required to make the model work and some of them are not very intuitive.We provide an extensive ablation study to quantify the effects these tricks and changes of architecture have on final performance. Furthermore, we examine current evaluation approaches and systematize available benchmark datasets.We believe that people interested in KG matching might profit from our work, as well as novices entering the field.

Another issue is that in many domains knowledge bases are spread across various data sources [14] and it is crucial to be able to combine information from different sources. In this work, we focus on knowledge bases in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which are particularly suited for information retrieval [17] . Joining information from different KGs is non-trivial, as there is no unified schema or vocabulary. The goal of the entity alignment task is to overcome this problem by learning a matching between entities in different KGs. In the typical setting some of the alignments are known in advance (seed alignments) and the task is therefore supervised. More formally, we are given graphs G L = (V L , E L ) and G R = (V R , E R ) with a seed alignment A = (l i , r i ) i \u2286 V L \u00d7 V R . It is commonly assumed that an entity v \u2208 V L can match at most one entity v \u2208 V R . Thus the goal is to infer alignments for the remaining nodes only.",

            "text": "In this section, we review previous work on entity alignment for Knowledge Graphs and revisit the current evaluation process. We believe that this is useful for practitioners, since we discover some pitfalls, especially when implementing evaluation scores and selecting datasets for comparison. An overview of methods, datasets and metrics is provided in Table 1 . Methods. While the problem of entity alignments in Knowledge Graphs has been tackled historically by researching vocabularies which are as broad as possible, and establish them as a standard, recent approaches take a more data-driven view. Early methods use classical knowledge graph link prediction models such as TransE [2] to embed the entities of the individual knowledge graphs using an intra-KG link prediction loss, and differ in what they do with the aligned entities. For instance, MTransE [5] learns a linear transformation between the embedding spaces of the individual graphs using an L 2 -loss. BootEA [19] adopts a bootstrapping approach and iteratively labels the most likely alignments to utilize them for further training. In addition to the alignment loss, embeddings of aligned entities are swapped regularly to calibrate embedding spaces against each other. SEA [15] learns a mapping between embedding spaces in both directions and additionally adds a cycle-consistency loss. Thereby, the distance between the original embedding of an entity, and the result of translating this embedding to the opposite space and back again, is penalized. IPTransE [26] embeds both KGs into the same embedding space and uses a margin-based loss to enforce the embeddings of aligned entities to become similar. RSN [8] generates sequences using different types of random walks which can move between graphs when visiting aligned entities. The generated sequences are feed to an adapted recurrent model. JAPE [18] , KDCoE [4] , MultiKE [25] and AttrE [20] utilize attributes available for some entities and additional information like the names of entities and relationships. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based models [3, 6, 22, 24, 27] 1 have in common that they use GCN to create node representations by aggregating node representations together with representations of their neighbors. Most of GCN approaches do not distinguish between different relations and either consider all neighbors equally [6, 22, 24] or use attention [3] to weight the representations of the neighbors for the aggregation.",

The smaller subsets were created by selecting a portion of entities (around 20K of 100K) which are popular, i.e. appear in many triples as head or tail. The number of aligned entities stays the same (15K). As [18] only reports the dataset statistics of the larger dataset, and does not mention the reduction of the dataset, subsequent papers also report the statistics of the larger dataset, although experiments use the smaller variant [3, 18, 19, 22, 26] . As the metrics rely on absolute ranks, the numbers are better than on the full dataset (cf. Table 3 ).",
