            "text": "A case of canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV-2c) infection in a 3-month-old feral kitten with a cerebral abscess and neurological disease is reported. The cat displayed ataxia and convulsions together with signs of gastroenteritis and profound alteration of the total and differential white blood cell counts. A parvovirus strain was detected by a TaqMan assay in the blood and faeces of the affected kitten, which was characterised as CPV by means of molecular assays but did not react with any of the CPV type-specific probes. By sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the VP2-protein gene, the CPV-2c strain displayed a non-coding mutation in the probe-binding region. Although the role of CPV-2c in this particular case is unclear, it is possible that it predisposed the kitten to the clinical signs seen. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor future spreading of this CPV-2c mutant, and any associated clinical signs, in the dog and cat population. F eline panleukopenia (FPL) is a contagious disease of cats which is traditionally caused by feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), a member of the genus Parvovirus closely related to canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) and other parvoviruses of carnivores. 1, 2 Carnivore parvoviruses are small, nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses that are very prone to genetic evolution. However, while FPLV since its first identification in 1920 has not undergone significant changes in the antigenic and biological properties, 3 CPV-2 has progressively evolved under partly positive selection, giving rise to antigenic variants that replaced the original type and possess different biological and antigenic properties. 4e6 Three antigenic variants of CPV-2 are currently known, namely CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, that have completely replaced the original type 2, still used in most commercial vaccines. 7, 8 In comparison to the original type 2, the antigenic variants are more aggressive and have re-gained the ability to replicate in vivo in the feline host. 9,10 FPL outbreaks caused by CPV-2a and CPV-2b have been described worldwide. 11, 12 In contrast, cases of CPV-2c infection in cats have been reported only in Italy 12,13 and there is a single report of overt disease associated to this antigenic variant. 12 FPL is usually characterised by profound leukopenia involving both lymphocytes and polymorphocytes and acute gastroenteritis with fever (40e41.5 C), abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. In-utero and immediate post-mortem infections may lead to the development of neurological disease as a consequence of virus colonisation of Purkinje cells of cerebellum, with newborn kittens displaying signs referable to cerebellar damage such as ataxia, circling and muscular weakness. 1 In this paper, a CPV-2c infection is reported in a kitten with intracranial abscess and convulsions.",

The day after the cat was again submitted to clinical examination due to the onset of neurological signs that consisted of ataxia and difficulty in standing and walking. Neurological examination revealed depressed postural reactions in all limbs, whereas oculo-vestibular responses, spinal reflexes, pain sensation and urinary and faecal continence were normal. Fever (40.0 C) and anorexia were also observed. New antibiotics were administered (enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg q 24 h, clindamycin 25 mg/kg q 12 h) in association with carprofen (2 mg/kg at q 48 h). Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-blood, serum and faecal samples were collected during the clinical examination for haematology, serum electrophoresis and immunochromatographic testing for detection of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Snap Feline Combo Plus; Idexx Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA) and CPV/FPLV (Snap; Canine Parvovirus Antigen Test, Idexx Laboratories) antigens.",

Serum electrophoresis did not reveal any important modification of the serum proteins and FIV/FeLV testing was negative, whereas the Snap Canine Parvovirus Antigen Test gave a positive result. In the subsequent days, the cat underwent a progressive clinical improvement, regaining appetite and a normal rectal temperature and losing the neurological signs. On June 23, EDTA-blood, serum, nasal and faecal samples were collected and sent to our laboratory for further investigations. Five days later the kitten was presented again at the veterinary clinic with loss of appetite and diarrhoea and an antibiotic therapy was started with sulfamethopyrazine (30 mg/kg q 24 h). On July 2, the appearance of convulsions was observed with more than 10 episodes per day. By post-contrast computed tomography (CT), carried out using a Philips MX8000 MultiSlice CT scanner, a focal area of markedly enhanced signal intensity compatible with an intracranial abscess was evident in the left parietal region in close proximity to the subcutaneous abscess. An adjacent area of decreased signal intensity of possible oedematous origin was observed together with reduction of the third ventricle and deviation of the falx cerebri. In contrast, there were no cerebellar abnormalities, and no signs of recent, or old, fractures of the cranial bones. Abscess and cerebrospinal fluid samples for cytology, bacteriology and/or virology were not collected at the clinical examination nor during CT. Administration of phenobarbital (2.5 mg/kg q 12 h) resulted in the rapid recovery of the kitten and loss of the neurological signs. The abscesses underwent progressive adsorption leading to complete recovery.",

CPV-2 molecular characterisation was achieved by means of a panel of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using MGB probes able to identify the antigenic variants 2a, 2b and 2c 16 and to discriminate between CPV vaccine and field strains. 17, 18 Faecal RNA extracts were screened by either realtime or conventional reverse transcriptase PCR assays specific for carnivore coronaviruses 19 and caliciviruses. 20 The blood extracts were also used to detect the proviral DNA of FIV 21 and FeLV 22 and the DNA of feline haemoplasmas. 23 Feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus were searched for in the nasal swab extract. 24 ",

The CPV-2c strain 300/10 of feline origin displayed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) to Italian type 2c strains displaying the same non-coding mutation at codon 425. 6 By phylogeny obtained using the neighbor-joining method, strain 300/10 was found to fall in the same cluster as Italian type 2c CPVs (Fig 1) , which was separate from that including a previous CPV-2c strain isolated from a cat with FPL. 12 The maximum parsimony method confirmed the topology of the neighbor-joining tree.",

Apart from the occurrence of marked lymphopenia, the haematological findings were not typical of FPL as total WBC and neutrophil counts were increased as a consequence of the concurrent abscess, whereas FPL is usually characterised by a dramatic reduction of all leukocyte subsets. Clinically, the occurrence of diarrhoea was compatible with the parvoviral infection, whereas fever could be attributed to either FPL or suppurative process. The prevalent sign in the cat was the appearance of neurological disease which was characterised by ataxia and subsequently by convulsions. FPL may cause neurological disorders only in newborn kittens due to the virus replication in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum subsequent to perinatal infection. Thus, the major finding is represented by ataxia due to cerebellar hypoplasia. 1 In the present case, ataxia was observed only in the early stage of the disease and was subsequently followed by severe seizures. In addition, the CT scanning showed focal lesions compatible with a parietal abscess without any involvement of the cerebellum, so that the neurological signs could be mainly attributed to the suppuration rather than to a viral infection. However, the recovery of the cat together with the lack of analyses on the cerebrospinal fluid prevented a definitive diagnosis for the neurological disorders. Although the clinical history and vaccination status of the cat were unknown, based on the low CPV-2c titres detected in the faeces and blood, it could be speculated that the cat was recovering from the infection when the neurological disease appeared. In this perspective, a preceding CPV-2c infection may have determined a general immunosuppression which could have been responsible for the parietal-brain colonisation by pyogenes.",
