In particular, regarding the airborne\nspread of infection, the treatment of indoor microbial-contaminants such as virus,\nbacteria, mould fungi and allergens is one of the most important topics [2, 3]. Conventional\nmethods for deactivation of microbial-contaminants involve heat (steam), chemical\nagents (active gases such as chlorine and ozone or solutions) and irradiation (UV).\nMost of these methods can cause adverse effects on the human body. When these\nconventional deactivation methods were used in a real environment, during the\ndeactivation procedure persons could not stay in it and had to be out of that\nenvironment. On the other hand, as a new sterilization method, non-thermal plasma\ntreatment technology is reported [4\u20138].\nA room-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma plume can be used without causing any\nheating or painful sensation for biomedical application. However, the plasma\ntreatment method has the sterilization effect only in the localized plasma region.\nThus, the plasma treatment is not appropriate for deactivation of airborne indoor\nmicrobial-contaminants. Recently deactivation technology that releases\nplasma-generated positive and negative ions was reported [9].\nBacteriostatic and fungi static effects of these ions were confirmed. In this\ntechnology, however, H+(H2O)m was used as a\npositive ion. It is of concern that releasing a large amount of H+\nmay cause toxic effects on the human body as an acid aerosol [10]. As a result\nthe amount of released ions was limited and the performance of this technology was\nalso limited. A real time deactivation method against the airborne indoor\nmicrobial-contaminants applicable for a real environment in which persons can remain\nhas been in great demand.",

Although the direct reaction between the\nindoor OH radical and the human cell and its toxicity were not yet clear, it was\nreported that the OH radical initiates a complex series of reactions that generate\nintermediates and ultimately produce species that can adversely affect human health\nin indoor environments. Some of the products of OH-initiated reactions are\nirritating at very low concentrations and some of the products are strong oxidants\nand/or very acidic compounds that will contribute to oxidative and corrosive\nprocesses [11].\nIn this paper, we report the development of a novel atmospheric pressure plasma\ndevice that releases atomic hydrogen, H, into the air. In this device,\nH+ generated by plasma is converted to atomic hydrogen that can\nneutralize the OH radical. The developed novel device is effective not only for\ndeactivation of airborne indoor microbial-contaminants but also for neutralization\nof the OH radical in the air by using released atomic hydrogen.

In the spectroscopic experiments,\nthe developed device was installed in a chamber where He gas (including water\nvapour) of 1 atm was filled. Figure 2 shows the experimental set-up for spectroscopic\ninvestigation. During the experiments, the temperature in the chamber was\n25 \u00b0C. The water vapour was fed with He gas by heating water in a tank\nset in a He gas inlet system. The concentration of water in the chamber almost\ncorresponded to the saturated vapour pressure of water at 25 \u00b0C. Optical\nemission from the plasma produced at the needle electrode was measured by a\nspectrometer with an image intensified CCD camera. Spatial distributions of emission\nintensities were measured in the area of \u22121 \u2a7d y\n\u2a7d +1 mm and \u22120.25 \u2a7d z \u2a7d\n+0.20 mm. An emission line of atomic hydrogen\nH I (656.3 nm) was clearly observed along with\nHe lines in the He/water vapour plasmas [15]. Figure 3 shows the spatial\ndistribution (3D plots) of the optical emission intensity of atomic hydrogen\nH I (656.3 nm) observed around the needle\nelectrode, where the origin is the point of the electrode corresponding to the peak\nposition of the intensity. The distribution shows remarkable asymmetry around the\nz-axis. The tail of the right wing stretches towards the\nceramic plate positioned 36 mm away from the needle electrode in the direction\nof the y-axis. This result indicates that the positive ions,\nH+, from the ceramic plate recombine with electrons emitted from\nthe needle electrode. The mechanism of the optical emissions in the device was\ndiscussed in our previous paper [15]. \n\n",

            "text": "The mechanism for deactivation of microbial-contaminants\nby plasma is an essential issue that is being discussed by many researchers. In our\ndevice, as stable neutral species, O3, nitrogen oxides (N2O5, N2O, NO,\nNO2, HNO2 and HNO3), and H2O2 can be\nproduced from the needle-shaped electrode. However, the concentrations of O3 and nitrogen oxides were measured to be less than\n0.01 ppm and 0.001 ppm, respectively as described in section 2. Since these concentrations\nwere very low, O3 and nitrogen oxides can be excluded from\nthe agents responsible for the observed deactivation of microbial-contaminants. In\naddition, the device reduced the cell death induced by H2O2 and\n\nproduced enzymatically in the culture medium as described in section\n4.2. This result\nsuggests that the device does not produce a significant amount of H2O2. The negatively charged species produced from\nthe needle electrode can be\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand\n\n. In the previous study [16], however, the deactivation of airborne\nbacteria was not observed when the efficacy test was conducted using only negatively\ncharged ions. Therefore, these negatively charged species are not responsible for\nthe deactivation of microbial-contaminants. According to Laroussi [6], active\nradicals and anions such as O, OH and\n\nplay the most important role in the destruction of micro-organisms in\natmospheric pressure plasma. Goree et al [8] investigated\nthe transport mechanism of bactericidal agents in the plasma needle. In their study,\nthe optical emissions of O and OH were observed from the glow of the plasma needle.\nThey reported that the bactericidal agent has a lifetime <0.5 ms. A spot\nfor killing bacteria by the plasma needle was 5 mm in diameter [8]. For OH, the\nlifetime in pure air at room temperature can be very short [20]. Depending on\nthe OH concentration, the recombination reaction of OH radicals can happen as fast\nas 50 \u00b5s at room temperature [20]. Thus, O and OH are not the agents\nresponsible for the observed deactivation of microbial-contaminants, because in our\nexperiments the deactivation was observed in the real-sized test chambers.",

For\nH+(H2O)m produced from the device, the\nlifetime is approximately 3\u20135 s in air [9]. In addition,\nthe superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of reduced water due to atomic hydrogen\nwas reported to be stable at 4 \u00b0C for over a month [21]. From these\nresults, atomic hydrogen surrounded by water molecules, H(H2O)m, is possibly long-lived. As a possible explanation of the observed\ndeactivation of airborne microbial-contaminants, we consider the following. In our\ndevice, H(H2O)m released from the device reacts with O2 and\n\nin air or at the surface of airborne microbial-contaminants. As a\nresult, active species, HO2 or\n\n, are generated. These active species break the cell membranes of\nbacteria and mould fungi or modify the protein located at the surface of the virus\nand allergens. In the previous paper [9], the haemagglutination reaction (HA) test\nwas conducted. In this case a haemagglutination reaction was not found in red blood\ncorpuscles (RBC) inoculated with influenza viruses that were exposed to positive and\nnegative ions. This result indicates that the spike-like haemagglutinin protein of\ninfluenza virus was modified by the exposure to these ions. In our device, although\nthe detailed mechanism is not yet clear, the surface protein of the virus would be\nmodified since similar reactions at the surface of virus can be expected. In the\ncase of allergens, HO2 or\n\ncould modify the surface protein and protect against\nantigen\u2013antibody reactions. As a result, the developed device has deactivation\ncharacteristics against airborne virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens. The\ndeactivation function of the device can be explained phenomenally as described\nabove, but the investigation of the mechanism on a molecular scale is needed and is\ncurrently underway.",

On the\nother hand, the OH-LIF intensity obtained in the atmospheric air plasma is\nextremely weak compared with the low-pressure one as shown in figure 9(b).\nThe LIF signal at 309 nm was stronger than that at 314 nm. The LIF\nsignal was not observed at 282 nm except for the Rayleigh scattering\nlight. In this excitation scheme the excited state rapidly relaxes into the\nlowest vibrational state due to frequent collision at atmospheric pressure.

The agent should be\nlong-lived, since the reduction in the OH-LIF signal was observed at a distance\nof 19 cm from the device. From these results, we consider that the atomic\nhydrogen surrounded by water molecules, H(H2O)m,\ngenerated by the reaction of H+(H2O)m and\nelectrons is responsible for the reduction of the OH radicals in the air. The\nrecombination of H(H2O)m and OH can reduce the\nconcentration of OH radicals in the air. The direct recombination of atomic\nhydrogen H and OH leads to O and H2. In our device,\nhowever, atomic hydrogen is surrounded by water molecules.
