Guidelines and executive orders issued by the White House, federal, and state governments recommend that elective surgical procedures including gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies be postponed. On March 15, 2010 guidelines were jointly published by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for GI Endoscopy.1",

Elective procedures that may be delayed and urgent/emergent procedures that may not be delayed are listed in the New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Guidelines for Endoscopy Units during the COVID-19 pandemic.2 The reasons for postponing elective surgery are mainly to conserve medical resources including health care providers, hospital capacities, essential personal protective equipment (PPE), and ventilators to reduce the risk of bringing the novel coronavirus into medical facilities and obviously to suppress further spreading of this virus. Although the foregoing reasons are sufficient to recommend the postponing of elective procedures, there are additional factors that need to be considered.",

Regurgitation and vomiting resulting in pulmonary aspiration under deep propofol sedation can occur, especially during a difficult colonoscopy, and silent regurgitation with pulmonary aspiration during EGD is not uncommon. When pulmonary aspiration occurs, the symptoms and signs of pneumonitis or pneumonia are very similar to COVID-19, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest X-ray (CXR)findings of areas of consolidation with ground-glass opacities. This will induce unnecessary confusion not only for the patient but also for the care givers and provoke anxiety and emotional burden. Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 include fever (77%\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11%\u201352%), and shortness of breath (3%\u201331%).3",

More serious and rapid progression of the illness is concerning in these elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Other consideration should be the similarity of symptoms between COVID-19 and aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.",
