The theme of the latest Gregynog research conference\u2014the evolution of catalysis\u2014may seem strange, too, in the eyes of the synthetic and mechanistic chemists who normally flock every spring to the idyllic conference centre of Prifysgol Cymru, the University of Wales, in the Montgomeryshire countryside. However, the theme of the conference, Directed Evolution\u2014that is, iterative cycles of selection from (or screening of) libraries of diverse molecules\u2014has come of age, and its potential is recognised beyond the circle of pioneers of the area. Two such pioneers, Andreas Pl\u00fcckthun (Z\u00fcrich University) and Don Hilvert (ETH Z\u00fcrich), masterminded the conference and set out the challenge of research in directed evolution at the beginning of the meeting\u2014to ultimately emulate enzyme function.",

Too long to wait! So these exceedingly slow processes were studied at elevated temperatures, to allow extrapolation back to room temperature. The comparison with enzymes shows awe\u2010inspiring rate accelerations of over 1020. Next to efficiency, precision of biological machines is a fundamental challenge. Bob Stroud (UC San Francisco) described how, in a combination of site\u2010directed mutagenesis, kinetics and crystallography, not only static active site interactions can be mapped out, but complex conformational changes can be tracked down for thymidylate synthase, a methyl transfer catalyst.2, 3 Nenad Ban (ETH Z\u00fcrich) described the ribosome structure:4\u20137 a protein of this complexity is definitely no realistic target for directed evolution. Nonetheless we had a taste of a successful designed alteration of protein structure. Kevan Shokat (UC San Francisco) has demonstrated how tyrosine kinases with an engineered binding pocket in a conserved region of the ATP\u2010binding site can be specifically inhibited in vivo, with synthetically prepared inhibitors found by screening. It greatly facilitated the study of the cell biology of these enzymes, which play a vital role in signal transduction and is being applied to to a growing list of key signal transduction kinases (e.g., src kinases).8\u201312\n",

It is definitely impossible to scan the entirety of sequence space\u2014even a fairly small enzyme with about 50 amino acids would, if completely randomised, create a library of more molecules that there are in the whole universe. A good rationale could enable more targeted sampling of sequence space. Dagmar Ringe (Brandeis) introduced enzyme superfamilies based on active site chemistry as evolutionary neighbours\u2014possible shortcuts for directed evolution.13 For example, eukaryotic muconate lactonising enzyme has the same signature motif and chemical functionality as its bacterial analogue (and superfamily member), but a very different fold (\u03b2 propeller instead of TIM barrel). Thus chemistry rather than structure becomes the guide for exploring new activities and understanding an enzyme's \u201ccatalytic phylogeny\u201d, an idea that differs from previous concepts of evolution by maintaining and re\u2010evolving a given fold such as the TIM barrel.",

Frances Arnold (Caltech) has developed an approach that would generate libraries that are relatively small, yet high in quality, thus increasing the chance of a hit. By using synthetic shuffling, fragments are chosen for being quasiautonomous, that is, amino acid stretches that share maximal contact, though do not (optimally) contact any other residue. These fragments are calculated from available structural data by the SCHEMA shareware.14\n",

Every documented protein was grouped into a family of related sequences, postulating in essence their evolutionary history and reconstructing their ancestral common sequence.30 In addition, this strategy can be useful for tracing the origins and function of new sequences with great speed, for example, of the SARS virus, thus identifying its primary source and suggest possible therapeutic strategies.",

The crucial technological requirement in all library approaches is how one's selected molecule can be decoded: selection screens for phenotype, but the genotype holds the key, and has to be linked phenotype. This is more straightforward in selections for nucleic acids as genotype and phenotype are identical. Ron Breaker (Yale) showcased a variety of allosteric ribozymes that were evolved and used as molecular switches, governed by light, by the presence of metal ions or small organic molecules. Strikingly, such \u201criboswitches\u201d (Figure 1) were identified as part of natural mRNAs, regulating their translation by recognising their cognate metabolite. Rather than the scientist mimicking nature, a novel discovery by directed evolution has shed light on a natural regulation mechanism.15\u201317\n",

From a library of randomly mutagenised class II aldolases they selected (by colony screening of cell lysates in 96\u2010well format) enzymes that catalyse C\u2014C bond formation in an aldol reaction, a key step in many natural\u2010product syntheses. After rounds of DNA shuffling, the resulting enzyme reversed the stereochemistry of tagatose 100\u2010fold, now accepting the unnatural substrate preferentially.18 Presenting another approach to the synthesis and cleavage of C\u2014C bonds, Veronique Gouverneur (Oxford) has explored the substrate versatility of catalytic aldolase antibodies for a variety of substrates.19\n",

Indeed, N or C terminus protein fusions of the evolved hAGT were shown to be specifically labelled in vivo; this enables the localisation of specific proteins to be studied.24\n",
