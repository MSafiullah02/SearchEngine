Bronchial responsiveness at this age is associated with clinical allergies, namely negatively with baseline lung function and positively with atopic sensitization. According to a nationwide database for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions, the number of children requiring intensive care admission for severe acute asthma (SAA) has increased between 2003 and 2013. SAA has the potential to progress to respiratory failure and can be fatal. SAA requiring admission at the PICU represents a major cost burden. Additionally, PICU admission itself is associated with greater psychological morbidity in children and their parents, when compared with admissions in general pediatric wards. Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify factors explaining the increase in PICU admissions in The Netherlands. Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study across all tertiary care PICUs in the Netherlands in which we retrospectively analyzed the number and characteristics of children hospitalized for SAA in the PICU during an 11-year period in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were all children aged 2-18 years, hospitalized for SAA in PICUs in The Netherlands between 2003 and 2013. Children younger than 2 years were not included because of the uncertainty of the diagnosis. The SAA diagnosis had to be confirmed before PICU discharge. All admissions and re-admissions were included in the study. Data included demography, SAA treatment at the referring hospital and PICU, and mortality. Results: In the 11-year study period, 590 children were admitted to a PICU, with a total of 660 admissions. During PICU admission, 83% of patients in our study received intravenous (IV) salbutamol. Dutch asthma guidelines require PICU admission in case IV salbutamol is given. Of these patients, 33% received a salbutamol infusion rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/min or less, and 58% received a higher infusion rate of 1.0 mcg/kg/min. Forty-two Per cent of all admitted children were 2-4 years old. Forty-four children were admitted for SAA in 2003, and this number remained relatively stable until 2010. Since 2010, the annual number of patients admitted to the PICU gradually increased to 138 in 2013. The age distribution and severity of SAA, based on the first blood gas and length of stay at the PICU, remained unchanged. The number of children with asthma did not triple since 2010. Over the years, the proportion of steroid-na\u00efve patients admitted to the PICU increased gradually, although fewer children necessitated invasive ventilation. High-flow nasal cannulas ('Optiflow\") were introduced in 2010, and their use increased significantly in the following years. Seven patients (1%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Inhospital mortality was n = 4 (0.6%). Conclusions: During the last decade, we observed a threefold increase in children with SAA admitted to PICUs in the Netherlands, while the age distribution and severity of illness remained similar. In our new 2006 national guidelines, PICU admission is mandatory with the use of IV salbutamol. We speculate that the observations are explained by implementation of the national SAA guideline, and by increasing undertreatment with inhaled steroids. Reflections and concrete proposals for action: Priority should be given to adequate diagnosis and treatment of children with asthma to prevent PICU admissions, as they carry a high cost, and are associated with the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder. Prospective studies into the risk factors for children with SAA which require salbutamol IV are needed. The safety of salbutamol IV should be further studied, and the need for PICU admission reconsidered. Asthma is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract in children. Quality of life of children suffering from asthma is a subjective experience of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their own lives. The main aims of our study were to verify the connections between symptoms of asthma lung functions and quality of life; influence of comorbidity and asthma on quality of life; to identify and quantify psychosocial areas that children perceive as handicapped due to illness and to verify the degree of similarity in the perception of quality of life between parents and children with asthma. Also, the aim of the study was to translate, adopt and validate on Serbian language Juniper questionnaires, namely (PAQLQ) Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with standardized operations, a variant with the examiner and questionnaire regarding the quality of life of caregivers of children with asthma \u2212 (PACQLQ) Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life Questionnaire. Using questionnaires, we wanted to verify the quality of life of the children with asthma and their parents. Results were analyzed in accordance with the severity and length of the disease, as well as with other parameters (degree of disease according to GINA, spirometry, comorbidity, etc.). The study included 100 children from 6-16 years old with intermittent and persistent mild and moderate asthma. During the study, patients were also classified according to Asthma control score. Diagnosis of asthma was established using well known guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. After registration, a detailed medical history was taken and physical examination was performed for all patients, as well as pulmonary function measurements. Upon arrival and during control examinations (week 1, 5 and 9), asthma control scores were obtained and interviews with children with asthma and their parents were organized. The PAQLQ includes 23 questions divided into three areas: limitation of activities (n-5), symptoms (n-10) and emotional functioning (n-8). The PACQLQ contains 13 questions divided into two main areas: restrictions in the performance of activities-A (5) and emotional function-E. For each question in both questionnaires, there were 7 possible answers, with grade 7 meaning ABSTRACT | S95 without any symptoms and complaints and grade 1 meaning prominent symptoms. There was a significant correlation between stage of asthma, symptoms, lung function and quality of life of children involved in the study. The clinical picture significantly affected the quality of life of children such that children with poorer control of the disease had a poorer quality of life. Also, improving disease control and asthma control score led to improved quality of life particularly in the areas of symptoms (F = 16,312, a p < 0,001) and emotional functions (F = 41.934, a p < 0.001). Comorbidity of asthma and other allergic diseases were very much present. Children with isolated asthma had a better quality of life then children with asthma and allergic rhinitis (5.76 vs. 6.24, p < 0.05). Parents and children had the same perception of the disease (coefficient correlation, r = 0.387 p < 0.001; r = 0.232 p = 0.031; r = 0.567 p < 0.001) while only parents assessed personal quality of life significantly worse than their children (t = 9.783 p < 0.001; t = 8.265 p < 0.001; t = 7.371 p < 0.001). Children involved in the study had the most complaints in the area of symptoms. Cough and limiting of physical activities were the elements most often cited. Emotional disturbances were less pronounced and sense of rejection did not significantly perturb patients involved in our study. Questionnaires for assessing the quality of life in children with asthma, translated into Serbian, showed good discriminative capability, a high reliability and specificity, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.78 and, as such, may be recommended to assess the quality of life in routine medical practice and clinical trials. As with all instruments currently available for use in children, further research is encouraged to verify the validity and usefulness of used questionnaires as a comprehensive health outcome measure in children. Results obtained in this study will promote the introduction of tools for measuring quality of life as an important parameter in estimating the stage of the disease and acceptance of asthma symptoms by patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Background: Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity, with episodes of disease worsening and exacerbation leading to hospitalization and impacting quality of life.

ABSTRACT Conclusion: This analysis suggests treatment with tiotropium reduces AEs related to asthma exacerbations and symptoms in pediatric patients, with a particular effect in reducing spring and autumn seasonal peaks. As long-term asthma exacerbation trials in pediatric patients remain ethically challenging, this analysis highlights an alternative endpoint to investigate such efficacy in children. These data also highlight the importance of trial timing to account for seasonal exacerbation peaks when a 12-month study length is not practical. Background: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, and guideline therapy often only results in partial symptom control. Despite this high unmet need for new treatments, relatively few new therapies have been approved for this age group within the last decade. Here we review endpoints that are currently used in clinical trials in pediatric patients with asthma, including lessons from the tiotropium in asthma clinical program, with the aim of encouraging and facilitating future clinical trials in pediatric patients with asthma. Methods: Recent literature in the field of pediatric clinical trials for asthma was reviewed.

The most common form of pediatric TB is pulmonary disease; however, other extrapulmonary forms of TB such as miliary, lymphatic, meningitis and others are also common, particularly in children. According to WHO, Costa Rica is considered a low TB incidence country (9.5 cases per 100 000). Nevertheless, this disease should be considered to be a public health threat in any country. In Costa Results: A total of 54 cases of diagnosed extrapulmonary disease were identified, of which 20 (37%) were miliary TB, followed by 14 (25.9%) cases with meningeal tuberculosis, 13 (24.1%) with tuberculous lymphadenitis, 3 (5.6%) pleural TB, 2 (3.7%) osteoarticular TB, and gastrointestinal and skin involvement in equal proportions in 1 (1.9%) patient.

We aimed to investigate the adverse events (AEs) related to asthma exacerbations and asthma symptoms that were reported across several pediatric trials investigating the safety and efficacy of tiotropium. Of particular interest was the identification of any seasonality pattern in the reporting of these AEs, whilst also ascertaining whether tiotropium efficacy was consistent throughout the year.Methods: We pooled data from 5 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials investigating the safety and efficacy of tiotropium in pediatric asthma: NinoTinA-asthma \u00ae , a 12-week, Phase II/III trial in patients aged 1-5 years with persistent asthmatic symptoms (NCT01634113); CanoTinA-asthma \u00ae , a 48week, Phase III trial in patients aged 6-11 years with moderate symptomatic asthma (NCT01634139); VivaTinA-asthma \u00ae , a 12week, Phase III trial in patients aged 6-11 years with severe symptomatic asthma (NCT01634152); RubaTinA-asthma \u00ae , a 48week, Phase III trial in patients aged 12-17 years with moderate symptomatic asthma (NCT01257230); and PensieTinA-asthma \u00ae , a 12-week, Phase III trial in patients aged 12-17 years with severe symptomatic asthma (NCT01277523). In all trials, patients received once daily tiotropium (5 \u03bcg or 2.5 \u03bcg) or placebo, delivered via the Respimat \u00ae inhaler as 2 puffs, in addition to inhaled corticosteroids with or without additional controllers. AEs related to asthma exacerbations or symptoms were defined using a composite endpoint according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 18.1 preferred term group 'asthma exacerbations and asthma-related symptoms'. The number of asthma exacerbations reported as AEs were plotted by month, with data from the Southern hemisphere shifted by 6 months to align the seasons (Northern hemisphere: June = month 6; Southern hemisphere: December = month 6). Results: Overall, 1,691 patients aged 1-17 years were included in the pooled analyses. The rate of patients reporting AEs related to asthma exacerbations and symptoms, number of patients with an event per 100 patient-years, was significantly reduced with tiotropium 5 \u03bcg (177 patients with event per 100 patient-years) compared with placebo (217 patients with event per 100 patient-years, rate ratio [RR] 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 0.93]). A similar, but non-significant, trend was associated with the tiotropium 2.5 \u03bcg dose (195 patients with event per 100 patient-years) compared with placebo (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.72, 1.05]).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Number of reported AEs related to asthma exacerbations and symptoms over 12 months Background: Recurrent asthma symptoms and exacerbations cause substantial morbidity in pediatric patients with asthma, therefore, a primary treatment goal is to prevent these from occurring. The definition of exacerbations commonly used in clinical trials is worsening of asthma symptoms or reduction in lung function for a defined period, with severe events requiring systemic steroid treatment and/or hospitalization. However, this definition may be too strict for pediatric trials, where sample size and trial duration are limited by ethical considerations. Adverse events (AEs) related to asthma exacerbations and worsening symptoms are also recorded among safety assessments as standard in clinical trials, and this may be an alternative endpoint for clinicians to consider in assessing efficacy in terms of exacerbations in pediatric patients. Herein, we compare the reporting of asthma exacerbations as an efficacy endpoint using the standard definition, with reporting of AEs related to exacerbations and symptoms in Phase III trials of tiotropium add-on in children and adolescents. Methods: This was an exploratory analysis of 5 Phase III trials comprising patients aged 12-17 years (RubaTinA-/PensieTinA-asthma\u00ae; moderate and severe asthma, respectively), aged 6-11 years (CanoTinA-/VivaTinA-asthma\u00ae; moderate and severe asthma, respectively) and 1-5 years (NinoTinA-asthma\u00ae; persistent asthmatic symptoms).

Exhaled nitric oxide is an important non-invasive marker for bronchial inflammation in children with asthma. The aim of the study: To investigate exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) values among 126 patients with asthma exacerbation and to follow them over a 3-month period. To evaluate certain clinical, laboratory and functional parameters and their correlation with FeNO. Methods: FeNO was measured by a single-breath on-line measurement. Laboratory tests included: leukocyte count, ESR, CRP. Total IgE levels were analyzed by ELISA. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed in all patients. Blood and sputum (nasal) eosinophils were counted. Serology tests for respiratory viruses were performed by ELISA. Results: FeNO was significantly higher in the asthmatic group compared with the control groups. There was a positive linear correlation between age and FeNO values. Male gender was dominant (62.9%). Positive family history was observed in over half of the asthmatic patients (58.9%). Upper respiratory airways were involved in 46.24% with allergic rhino sinusitis. A number of asthmatics had a long duration of bronchial asthma (more than 5 years): 50.79%. Mean total IgE values were increased in the group of asthmatics (252.69IU/ml).

No Effect of Variant Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Genotypes on the Frequency of Parental-Reported Wheezing and Breathlessness during the First Three Years of Life in the ALSPAC Birth Cohort. Alasevi\u010dius T., Valiulis A. Clinic of Children's Diseases, Vilnius University \u2212 Vilnius, Lithuania Background: Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Aside from the most important function as an inhibitor of proteinases, AAT is also implicated in the modulation of immune reactions and inflammation. Early-onset preschool wheezing has been suggested as being the first manifestation of COPD. Also, pilot data suggest that variant AAT genotypes may predispose children to more severe episodes of wheezing in early childhood. If this is the case, these children may be identified early in life by their wheezing characteristics and intervention measures might be applied to prevent the development of AATrelated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Materials and methods: We chose to analyze the data from the ALSPAC cohort. AAT genotypes were determined from imputed genome data on the most common variant SNPs rs17580 (PiS) and rs28929474 (PiZ). Data on wheezing characteristics were obtained via questionnaire at several time points during the first 3 years of life.

To date, the possible uses in children have only been explored through a limited number of individual case reports, one prospective multicenter study (1) and one retrospective analysis (2). Methodology: We report on a three-year-old boy with mitochondriopathy and suspected tuberculosis due to contact with a tuberculosis patient and prolonged cough. Further diagnosis revealed a positive tuberculin skin test, a right lobe atelectasis and a bilateral hilum prominence. Gastric aspirates remained without germ detection. Despite triple therapy with INH, RMP and PZA, an increasing stenosis of the left main bronchus developed after 2 months. Bronchoscopically, lymph node penetration was the cause of the stenosis. Endosonographically (EBUS PENTAX), it was possible to visualize pathological lymph nodes via EBUS and EUS mediastinally on the left (position 2L, 7 and 9) and to perform a transesophageal EUS-B-FNA from position 7 and 9. Results: Bronchoalveolar lavage showed acid-fast bacilli. The PCR for M. tuberculosis complex was positive.

Aside from a high mortality rate, pneumonia also causes a significant number of hospitalizations. We conducted this study to present the outcomes of children hospitalized with pneumonia in West Nusa Tenggara Province General Hospital. Methods: A respirology registry of children aged 2 months to 15 years of age admitted with pneumonia from January 2015 to December 2016 was retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, physical examination, laboratory and radiology findings, and outcomes were carried out in all children admitted with pneumonia. Results: Out of the 392 children admitted with pneumonia, 187 (47.7%) were admitted in 2015 and 205 (52.3%) in 2016. The majority were male \u2212 224 (57.1%), aged between 2 and 12 months \u2212 259 (66.1%), and had Fe deficiency anemia \u2212 215 (54.8%) as co-morbidities. Nine of 392 (2.3%) had very severe pneumonia, while 383/392 (97.7%) were admitted with severe pneumonia. About 208/392 (53.1%) were hospitalized for more than 5 days, with an average length of hospital stay of 7.4 days (2015) and 6.8 days (2016). Overall, the mortality rate was 24/392 (6.1%), with 8/187 (4.3%) in 2015 and 16/205 (7.8%) in 2016, respectively. Eighteen of 24 (75%) were aged between 2 and 12 months, of whom 6/24 (25%) were admitted with very severe pneumonia, and 18/24 (75%) with severe pneumonia with two or more co-morbidities. Conclusions: Although the mortality rate of children hospitalized with pneumonia in our hospital had increased from 2015 through 2016, the average length of stay in hospital nevertheless declined. These findings highlight the need for further prospective studies to identify the risk factors of prolonged hospital stay and mortality as poor outcomes in children hospitalized with pneumonia.

Morbidity is high and the evaluation of childhood pneumonia interventions should include potential impact on long term respiratory sequelae, which are more likely in children requiring hospital admission. Identification of the agent is also important since different viruses have different rates of complications, with adenovirus pneumonia being associated with the highest risk of sequelae. The most commonly isolated viruses in childhood pneumonia requiring hospitalization are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza and coronavirus. This study intends to evaluate the follow-up of children with viral pneumonias that required hospitalization in a tertiary pediatric hospital as well as long term respiratory complications, particularly postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans for its usual severity and major impact in children and families. and whose diagnosis at the time of discharge was viral pneumonia. Children with previously known comorbidities were excluded. The diagnosis of viral infection was established clinically and by imaging features suggestive of viral infection (bilateral interstitial infiltrates and alveolar infiltrates).

Mesquita AP. 1 , David S. 1 , Franco D. 1 , Molinaro A. 1 , Pinha J. 2 , Ramos J. 2 , Montesanto S. 2 , Rocha B. 3 , Santos PF. , Jesus Municipal Hospital \u2212 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Introduction: Tuberculosis still remains a serious public health problem worldwide, especially in third world countries, and it is estimated that 1/3 of the world's population has already been infected by Koch's bacillus. Polyserositis tuberculosa, an uncommon condition, is a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that can occur at any age. Young children and HIV-positive adults are particularly susceptible. About 25% to 30% of children with tuberculosis manifest an extrapulmonary form. After penetrating the body via the respiratory tract, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can spread and settle in any organ, either during the first infection, when specific immunity is not yet developed, or thereafter, at any time, if there is an ability of the host to maintain the bacillus in its implantation sites. The definitive diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is very difficult: it can be presumptive, as long as other conditions are excluded. The treatment consists in the RIPE regimen (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) and can be started only with the presumptive diagnosis, assisting the completion of definitive diagnosis. The objective of this work is to report the case of a teenager with tuberculosis polyserositis. Case report: J.V.M.M., 15-year-old teenager, male, black, from Rio de Janeiro-Brazil, admitted to the Jesus Municipal Hospital, RJ, on December 2017 for ascite symptoms investigation. His mother reported that he had been affected with fever, nausea and vomiting for 10 days. He sought immediate medical attention and was released after intramuscular benzathine penicillin injection. Without improvement, he sought new care the following day, being given the diagnosis of urinary infection. A dose of ceftriaxone was administered and he was sent home with a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin prescription. With no response to medication, on the fourth day of treatment with ciprofloxacin, he started having ascites. On the seventh day of treatment, the ascites were already large and the previous symptoms, such as fever and night sweats, persisted. He sought emergency care, being hospitalized and referred to this unit for investigation. Physical examination on admission: Thin, eupneic (FR = 16irpm), good perfusion, acyanotic, hypocortical (+/\u2212 4), massive ascites, abdominal circumference measuring 88 cm, remainder of the exam without other abnormalities. Ciprofloxacin maintained. Complementary examinations demonstrated: non-specific blood count, HSV = 105 mm, TGO = 36U/l, TGP = 26U/l, DHL = 636 U/l, FA = 114U/l, albumin = 2.8g/dl, negative rapid test for dengue, negative tuberculin test and negative serologies for hepatitis and HIV. Image exams: chest X-ray with small calcified lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Abdominal USG only proved the voluminous ascites. Chest CT was performed after 10 days of hospitalization, which demonstrated extensive pleural effusion in the left hemithorax. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated compacted cardiomyopathy, and patient started on captopril. Diagnostic puncture of the ascites fluid was performed, which showed an increase in cells with mononuclear predominance and adenosina deaminase (ADA) = 113U/l, justifying the empirical treatment with RIPE: rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Clinical improvement was observed quickly and the patient no longer had a fever and with 5 days of treatment, presented a drastic reduction in ascites, going from 88 cm of abdominal circumference to 77 cm. Conclusion: In the case described, it is important to draw attention to the differential diagnosis of ascites. In the present case, the family history of tuberculosis was negative, however, due to the high prevalence of the disease in Brazil, tuberculosis was investigated. The inflammatory tuberculosis effusion can also occur in any of the serous cavities: pleural, pericardial or peritoneal. Clinical presentation of polyserositis is the sum of symptoms from the involvement of each serous.

In low-middle income countries (LMICs), pneumonia is the biggest killer of young children globally, accounting for nearly one in five deaths among children aged less than 5 years. Nonetheless, pneumonia represents an important burden of morbidity in the developed world, in particular severe pneumonia, although mortality is low. Clinical and epidemiological information is crucial to characterize patients with severe pneumonia, given that they are at the highest risk of death. The WHO (2014) has reported that in low resource settings, risk factors for severe pneumonia in children include malnutrition, lack of breastfeeding, indoor air pollution (caused by cooking and heating with biomass fuel), living in crowded homes and parental smoking. On the other hand,>6 months breastfeeding and routine vaccination against common childhood illnesses has been identified as a major role in decreasing mortality rates. A better understanding of the risk factors associated with child pneumonia and severe pneumonia is of utmost importance, since primary prevention strategies are likely to achieve major reductions in pneumonia-associated morbidity and mortality in children.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF18": {"text": "severe pneumonia.

There was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and clindamycin was initiated, without evident clinical improvement. A CT-guided biopsy of the lesion was conducted. Mycobacterial, aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the pulmonary tissue and blood cultures were all negative. The histopathology analysis of the biopsy excluded malignancy and PCR of the biopsy revealed nocardiosis. All other PCR studies were negative. Autoimmune disease and immunodeficiency were excluded by normal findings, including negative serum examination and PCR detection for HIV. Brain CT, echocardiogram and cervical Doppler ultrasound were normal. The treatment was changed to IV imipenem and oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMX) for two weeks. The total therapy period was 3 months with TMP/SMX. There was full clinical recovery of the patient. Follow-up appointments were scheduled. Discussion: We present a case of pulmonary nocardiosis in an immunocompetent adolescent. The clinical presentation of pulmonary nocardiosis is non-specific and chest radiograph normally reveals lesions in the superior lobe that are often attributed to other causes, which delays the correct diagnosis. The difficult isolation of the bacterial agent and its slow growth in culture makes it a challenging diagnosis. In this case, the lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy justified an invasive procedure (pulmonary biopsy) to obtain S120 | new samples for in vitro culture and PCR. A positive PCR result for Nocardia sp. led to the final diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis. The culture was negative. To improve the culture rate identification of Nocardia, it is necessary to notify the laboratory regarding the clinical suspicion. This allows the establishment of an adequate incubation time and avoiding the use of decontamination solutions that are toxic for Nocardia sp. There are few documented cases of pulmonary nocardiosis affecting adult immunocompetent patients and usually associated with pulmonary chronic disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulmonary nocardiosis in a previously healthy pediatric patient. This clinical case highlights key points that should be considered by the pediatric pneumologist in a similar context: 1) consider unusual agents that cause pulmonary abscess, even in the absence of known risk factors; 2) recognize the importance of using PCR, especially if antibiotic treatment has been previously initiated; 3) promote a close partnership between the attending clinician and microbiologist to efficiently explore the samples obtained from the patient.

These complications can occur at any period of time after the procedure and three possible mechanisms have been postulated: intrathoracic trauma during shunt placement, dislocation of the peritoneal catheter into the chest and fluid shift from the peritoneal cavity to the pleural cavity [2]. Case report: Herein we report the case of a 2-year-old Caucasian female patient with Pfeiffer syndrome and VP-derived hydrocephalus who was admitted at our Respiratory Unit for irritability, tachypnea with need of mechanical ventilation and increased baseline oxygen requirement and vomiting. She was afebrile and cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Normal lung sounds and good ventilation were noted bilaterally; no dullness to percussion was reported. The remainder of the physical examination was negative. Results of venous blood gas and routine blood tests were normal. Thorax X-ray showed a complete opacification of the right hemithorax with mild associated compressive atelectasis. A large right-sided pleural effusion was detected on thorax CT scan and an abdomen CT scan revealed the dislocation of the distal tip of the VP shunt (Figure 1). A thoracentesis was performed and the analysis of pleural fluid confirmed the CSF leakage. Because of right recurrent effusion, the distal end of VP shunt was positioned back into the abdomen and a ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt was established in order to prevent a recurrent pleural effusion. Discussion: pleural effusion due to VP shunt insertion is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that should be suspected in any patient with VP shunt and respiratory failure. Overall, 21 studies have been published in the pediatric age. The timing of occurrence of this chest complication is variable and dislocation of the distal tip of the VP shunt is not prevalent.

Aim: We aimed to evaluate the etiology, diagnostic methods, treatments and outcomes of patients with atelectasis in childhood. Methods: Data of children with atelectasis in a tertiary pediatric pulmonology center between 2007 and 2015 were evaluated.Results: In this period, 194 patients were diagnosed with atelectasis and mean age was 5.8 \u00b1 4.0 years. The most common complaint was coughing. Ninety-five patients had pneumonia and 23 patients had acute asthma exacerbation during diagnosis. The underlying diseases were asthma, primary ciliary dyskinesia, neuromuscular disease such as hypotonia or myopathy, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, tracheal/bronchomalacia, cystic fibrosis, and other rare causes. Diagnosis was made via bilateral chest X-ray in 76% of the patients and computed tomography in 23%. The most common atelectasis was observed in right middle lobe. If present, the underlying condition was treated, all patients were treated by chest physiotherapy and mucolytic treatment and 10% of the patients had bronchoscopy while 7% had dornase alpha treatment in addition to these treatments. Twenty-two patients had recurrent atelectasis, and in 37 patients atelectasis did not resolve.Conclusion: It is important for clinicians to keep in mind that atelectasis may have different radiological findings. Recognizing radiological findings is important both for treatment and unnecessary further studies involving high-dose radiation. Patients with impaired mucociliary function may have recurrent or non-recovering atelectasis. D36 \u2212 Tracheomalacia in Children \u2212 Long-term Retrospective Clinical Follow-up. Kusak B., Cichocka-Jarosz E., Jedynak-Wasowicz U., Lis G. Department of Pediatrics, Chair of Pediatrics Jagiellonian University Medical College \u2212 Krakow, Poland Introduction: Tracheomalacia (TM) is a fairly common airways disorder, identified in 1 to 2100 \u2212 2500 children. Moreover, TM diagnosing has been increasing in the last decade with the improvement of imagining capabilities (fiberobronchoscopy, radiology procedures) and with the growing awareness of this disorder among clinicians. TM can be established as primary or secondary (e.g. secondary to trachea compression by great arteries). Regardless of pathophysiology, are commonly seen in children with other respiratory disorders. It is believed that TM is a mild disease with a tendency to resolve spontaneously in the first two years of life. However, recent studies indicate that some TM symptoms (cough during exertion, prolonged cough after respiratory tract infection, exertional dyspnea) could be observed even in older children. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features of children with TM in the long-term follow-up period. Methods: Children with TM were identified in the dataset of fiberobronchoscopic examinations performed between 2005 and 2015 at the University Children's Hospital in Krakow. Children with tracheostomy, immune deficiency disorders, cystic fibrosis were excluded from the analysis. Parents of children older than 6 years were surveyed by an authorial questionnaire. They were asked about presence, type and severity of respiratory symptoms in their children in two-time points: in the first year after TM diagnosis and in the last year preceding the survey. They were requested to evaluate their children's respiratory problems in relation to their general judgment and concern to health conditions. Construction of questions was various (yes/no questions, multiple choice questions, open questions, questions with graphical scale). Out of 55 identified children with TM, 24 (44%) constituted the study group, 13 of whom were boys (54%). In these children, TM was diagnosed at the median age of 1.4 years [interquartile range (IQR): 0.5-6.9], the survey was conducted at the median age of 8 years [IQR: 6.9-8.9], thus the median follow-up period was 6.2 years [IQR: 3.3 \u2212 6.8]. There was primary TM in 21 children and secondary TM \u2212 in 3 (2 children with vascular rings, 1 child after surgery of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula). In 9 (36%) children, accompanying laryngo-and/or bronchomalacia was identified (laryngomalacia in 2, bronchomalacia in 6, both in 1). It should be noted that the group of children for whom parents did not return the questionnaire (n = 31) was not significantly different from the study group in terms of: gender (16 (52%) boys, p = 0.85), the median age at the time of TM diagnosis (0.8 years [IQR: 0.1-4.8], p = 0.08), the ratio of primary to secondary TM (primary TM was in 26 children, secondary TM in 5 and between them: 3 children with vascular rings, 2 children after surgery of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, p = 0.7) and coexistence of laryngo-or bronchomalacia (laryngomalacia in 6, bronchomalacia in 11, p = 0.2). Results: Parents reported a high frequency of respiratory tract infections in the first year after TM diagnosis in 17 (71%) children and in 13 (54%) in the last year preceding the survey. In comparison to the first year after TM diagnosis, respiratory tract infections in the last year parents of 15 (63%) children in the first year after TM diagnosis and still reported in 12 (50%) in the last year preceding the survey (p = 0.38). Moreover, exertional dyspnea (exercise intolerance) was observed by parents in 10 (42%) children and post-exercise cough in 9 (38%). On the other hand, 7 (29%) children could manage strenuous physical activity without any disturbing respiratory symptoms. In 22 (92%) children, parents described cough during respiratory infection as barking or unusual in sound. However, in 13 (54%), they reported the same characteristics of cough in periods outside of infections.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF29": {"text": "We need further investigations in children with TM history in the area of pulmonary function testing, including considering exercise challenge testing.

The delay in diagnosis is associated with increased incidence of complications with significant morbidity and mortality in the affected children. We present a 3-year-old girl with chronic symptoms of daily spasmatic cough preceded by protracted pneumonia. The girl was non-atopic and had normal neurological development with negative family history. The parents reported that the child consumed whole nuts but emphatically declined any choking episode. The symptoms started a year ago prior to the admission in our department with roentgenological and clinical signs of infiltrative pneumonia in the right lower lobe. The CT-scan confirmed the clinical diagnosis without any suspicions for complications or foreign body aspiration. The aggressive and longlasting antibiotic treatment led to temporary improvement followed by a two-month asymptomatic period. In the last nine months, the child had daily morning paroxysm of dry cough with expectoration of a low amount viscous mucoid sputum which was difficult to clear. The child was treated with antihistamines, LTRA, nasal corticosteroids, antibiotics without any improvement. Adenectomy was performed. In our Clinic, the child presented with clinical and roentgenological signs of right lower lobe pneumonia with suspected bronchiectasis and moderate elevated inflammatory markers. The sputum culture showed H. parainfluenzae, the Mantoux test and sweat test were negative, immune deficiency was excluded. The HRCT with contrast cough was provided. The child is still being followed. Tracheobronchial foreign-body aspiration in children is still considered as one of the most important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for physicians. In cases without any history of choking incident, the early diagnosis is a state of art. The consumption of whole nuts in toddlers is one of the leading causes of foreign body aspirations in our geographical region and is often a missing clue pointing to the correct diagnosis. The delay in foreign body extraction could lead to non-reversible lung damage with chronic purulent inflammation.

Department of Pediatric Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital \u2212 Singapore, Singapore Background: Communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformations (CBPFM) are congenital anomalies characterized by a patent communication between a portion of the lung and the esophagus or stomach. The spectrum ranges from esophageal atresia with a communication between distal esophagus and the sequestrated lung (Type I), immature lung with a mass that is formed from the distal esophagus (Type II), a connection between the sequestered lung lobe and the esophagus or stomach (Type III), and a communication between the esophagus and the bronchial system (Type IV). CBPFM are rare and the majority of cases present with symptoms in infancy. We report a case of CBPFM with an unusual presentation of a pulmonary cavitary lesion in late childhood.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF31": {"text": "He was treated empirically for cavitary pneumonia with a course of antibiotics. The follow-up chest X-ray showed persistence of the cavitary lesion. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax revealed the lesion to be an area of consolidation with dilated air spaces. Of note, the medial end of the branching airways in the cavitary pneumonia did not show a connection with the trachea or right bronchus, but was instead directed towards the esophagus. The esophagus also showed a tubular out-pouching at its right lateral aspect, suspicious of a bronchopulmonary malformation with a communication to the esophagus. A water-soluble contrast swallow was performed, demonstrating the contrast opacifying a cranially angulated tubular branching structure arising from the right anterior aspect of the esophagus, consistent with a Type III CBPFM. The child underwent resection of the CBPFM. Pre-operative flexible bronchoscopy showed absence of the right upper lobe bronchus. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated an acutely angulated fistula on the right side of the mid esophagus. Purulent fluid was noted on entry into the esophagus. Open thoracotomy confirmed a Type III CBPFM with esophageal communication. The CBPFM was resected with no complications. Histology confirmed findings of CBPFM with presence of pneumonia, micro-abscess formation and bronchiectasis, and no signs of malignancy. The child recovered well after the surgery, with resolution of the chronic cough. Discussion: A wide spectrum of diseases ranging from infections, malignancies, chronic systemic diseases and congenital malformations such as CBPFM may cause cavitary lesions in the lung. This case highlights the pitfall of relying on \"classical\" chest X-ray finding and history in making the correct diagnosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis and malignancies would be the top differentials given the history of prolonged cough, hemoptysis and cavitary lesion on chest X-ray, but the cause turned out to be a rare condition.Careful and unbiased history taking is important. A retrospective review of the case notes showed that the initial complaint was hematemesis at the Emergency Department triage. Retrospective clarification with the parents revealed that the prolonged cough was temporally related to feeding. These history findings would fit better with CBPFM.While the chest X-ray suggested a cavitary lesion, the CT thorax revealed that it was severe bronchiectasis of the the right upper lobe bronchus that led to the identification of the possible communication with the esophagus.

Khalsi F., Hadj Hassine S., Belhadj I., Ben Romdhane M., Tinsa F., Brini I., Hamouda S., Boussetta K. Pediatric Department B, Children Hospital of Tunis \u2212 Tunis, Tunisia Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is a mycobacterial infectious disease that has a wide range of manifestations. Anemia is a commonly seen manifestation in patients with TB, however hemolytic anemia is a rare cause of tuberculosis-associated anemia. We report 4 cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in association with childhood disseminated tuberculosis. Methods: Retrospective study including 4 cases of disseminated tuberculosis associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Results: A total of 4 cases of disseminated tuberculosis (DT) associated AIHA were hospitalized in our department during the year 2017. They were respectively aged 10, 8, 12 years, and 6 months. Two children had a history of DT (one child), and of lymph node TB (one child) one year before hospitalization. The initial presentation included fever, asthenia and pallor in all cases. The different localizations of TB were: pulmonary (3 patients), pericardial (3 patients), abdominal (3 patients), lymph nodes (4 patients) and meningitis (2 patients). The initial laboratory tests showed hemoglobin levels between 6.6 and 8 g/dl, with direct Coombs test positive for IgG in all cases indicating warm AIHA. All children were transfused at least once, and two patients needed recurrent transfusions. AIHA responded well to specific antibiotic treatment for two patients, and corticosteroid therapy was not necessary. For the two patients who had tubercular meningitis, they were started on anti-TB along with corticosteroids simultaneously, and AIHA responded well to this course of treatment. Direct Coombs test turned negative in all patients. Conclusion: The association of AIHA with tuberculosis is extremely rare.

In this present study, we aimed to determine the types of congenital lung diseases (CLD) and each anomaly is discussed in terms of underlying etiology, clinical presentation, and imaging characterization with emphasis on the most up-to-date research and treatment in the pediatric patient group attended in our hospital. The obstetric and other patient groups were evaluated for CLD existence by various imaging techniques between 2003 \u2212 2017. Patients with any type of CLD were evaluated retrospectively. In this 14-year time period, 23 patients were diagnosed with CLD. Seven patients were diagnosed with ultrasonography only, 2 patients with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in the prenatal period. Ten patients were diagnosed with computed tomography in the postnatal period. The early diagnosis and treatment of CLD is of most importance given its fatal progression in the prenatal and postnatal period. Ten of the patients were operated, 3 were operated during the neonatal period, 4 during infancy, and 3 between 1 and 13 years of age. None of the patients developed any complications. Postoperative followup duration ranged between 1 month and 5 years of age. Only 5 patients had accompanying diseases, which were VSD, hemivertebra, pectus excavatus, PFO, IgA deficiency and milk allergy. These anomalies can be detected with increasing frequency by pre-natal sonography, but may also present for the first time with symptoms in childhood or later life. We believe intrauterine diagnosis and follow-up are important in these patients.

We sought to review our experience in infants and children with anatomically complete vascular rings, and compare clinical presentation and outcomes with those with double aortic arch (DAA) and right aortic arch with left ligamentum (RAA). Patients and methods: Children with severe chronic respiratory and gastroesophageal symptoms and the above two aortic arch anomalies, detected by flexible bronchoscopy and chest CT scan, were evaluated. Age at symptom onset, at diagnosis and at surgery and symptoms frequency at diagnosis and after surgical correction were evaluated and compared in the two patient groups. Results: Out of 35 children, 18 had a double aortic arc and 17 had a right aortic arch, 8 with right aortic and associated Kommerell diverticulum. In the whole population, the median age at symptom onset, at diagnosis and at surgery was 3.0 (3.0-36.0), 10.0 (1.0-72.0), and 36.0 (7.5-84.0) months old, respectively. Time intervals between age at symptom onset and diagnosis, age at symptom onset and surgery, and diagnosis and surgery were significantly lower in the DAA group than in the RAA group (p < 0.005, each comparison). In the whole population, the most prevalent manifestations at diagnosis were chronic cough (74%), dyspnea (37%), LRT infections (37%) and dysphagia/regurgitation (34%). Only the prevalence of dysphagia/ regurgitation was different in the two groups, being higher in the DAA than in the RAA group (p < 0.05). Because of the severity of symptoms and the lack of response to medical treatment, all patients underwent surgical repair: a) resection of the lesser of the 2 aortic arches in DAA, and b) vascular ring release in RAA, with resection of the Kommerell diverticulum, when present, followed by transposition of the left subclavian artery to the left carotid artery. In addition, anterior aortopexy was performed in 4 patients. No major improvement in respiratory symptoms, as well as in patients with residual airway malacia, were reported in both groups. Conclusion: In children with DAA and RAA, surgical treatment can be accomplished with low morbidity and essentially no mortality and good clinical outcomes.

Endobronchial presentation is infrequent. Histologically, it is composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasmocytes and myofibroblasts. The treatment of choice remains conservative surgery and one should always seek to obtain free margins due to the possibility of local recurrence. The objective of this work is to report a case of inflammatory pseudotumor as a cause of persistent pulmonary images in children. Case report: P.O.A, 9 years old, schoolboy, male, from RJ, Brazil, hospitalized at the Municipal Jesus Hospital, RJ, for investigation of persistent pulmonary imaging in HTE and recurrent pneumonia. The mother reported 10 days of fever and cough, with a treatment of amoxicillin given on an outpatient basis, with no improvement. The condition evolved with abdominal pain and vomiting. No weight loss or decline in general state of health was noted. He reported two previous hospitalizations for pneumonia, the first of which was 6 months ago, with left pleural effusion. Four months later, he presented a new pneumonia episode in the same location. All required immunizations had been given. There was a family history of tuberculosis (mother and maternal grandfather). He lives with his mother and grandfather in a home with good hygiene and sanitation. Physical examination: eutrophic, eupneic (FR = 24irpm), good perfusion, acyanotic, hypocortical (+/\u2212 4). Bronchial Murmur reduced in the left hemithorax, without adventitious noises. The remainder of the examination went without notable issues. Amoxicillin with clavulanate and symptomatic treatment was initiated. Complementary examinations demonstrated: anemia (ht = 28.8% and hb = 9.9g/dl), leukocytosis with left shunt 22000 (with 15 sticks and 65 segmented), HSV = 28 mm, PCR = 122 mg/l, normal biochemistry and two negative tuberculin tests. Image exams: chest X-ray with hypotransparency in 2/3 lower HTE and left posterior opacity. Negative results for sputum smear microscopy were recorded.

Infants affected tend to present with dyspnea, tachypnea, persistent cough, failure to thrive and hypoxemia. It is a poorly understood disease. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare low-grade skin malignancy with high probability of recurrence. Its origin is not well established. It presents as a firm lesion, on which nodes may arise. The disease prevails between the second and fifth decades of life, but there are reports of presentation in childhood and at birth. DFSP has surgical treatment. Objective: To report a simultaneous occurrence of two rare diseases: NEHI and DFSP. Case Report: Male patient, 5 years old, with hospitalization at 7 months of age with history of respiratory distress since birth, sporadic dry cough, failure to thrive and need for nocturnal supplemental oxygen for a short period. During evaluation in Pediatric Pulmonology at 8 months of age, physical examination revealed a weight lower than 3rd percentile of the standard growth chart, absence of toxemia, increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest and pectus carinatum, tachydyspnea at rest, with normal oxygen saturation in room air, and bibasilar crackles. Chest radiography showed lung hyperinflation.

Being in the second cohort was associated with lower proportions of NE for all ages combined, with an odds-ratio (OR) of 0.44.This is the first study to identify secular changes in early pulmonary inflammation during the first years of life in CF. This finding suggests that enhanced focus and surveillance of early lung disease over the past decade manifests as improvements in early disease outcomes. Alternatively, these trends may be arising due to improvements in treatment following diagnosis occurring generally and unrelated to increased surveillance. The finding of reduced inflammation has the potential to be associated with longer-term improvements and even enhanced survival. We report that thedevelopment of early CT-identified bronchiectasis has not yet shown a significant downward trend and it is therefore necessary to further evaluate the potential for reducing inflammation early in life and the subsequent development of bronchiectasis later in life.

Shaltoni D. 1 , Narayan O. 2 1 Medical Student, RCSI-MUB \u2212 Dublin, Ireland; 2 Respiratory Medicine, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital \u2212 Manchester, United Kingdom Purpose of the study: Identifying a pattern between the first isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) from oropharyngeal swabs and the preceding viral infection in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Children in the first five years of life acquire several episodes of viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections and can end up presenting to hospital for supportive treatment. Methods: This was a retrospective study at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, a tertiary center for cystic fibrosis. Children with CF up to the age of 5 years were included in the study. Data was collected using an electronic database from January 2012 until December 2016. A diagnosis of a first PA isolation was confirmed with cough / oropharyngeal swabs. A diagnosis of a viral infection was confirmed with viral PCR on the nasopharyngeal aspirate. Results: 56 children were included in the study, out of which 24 acquired an initial PA infection in the first 5 years of life. 8 out of these 24 children had a preceding viral infection in the last 8 months. 1 child had a preceding viral infection in the last 2 years. This might be due to undiagnosed viral infections that occurred closer to the initial PA infection date. The length of time from the last viral infection to the first acquisition of PA infection varied from a few days to a few months. No temporal relationship was established between both variables. Common viral isolates were Rhino virus and RSV. Conclusions: 9/24 is a significant number (p < 0.05) of preceding positive viral infections before first PA isolations. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find a causal correlation between viral infections and the initial acquisition of PA in the early years of CF patients. The earlier the acquisition of PA infection, the more severe the CF-associated lung disease and the worse the prognosis. Small numbers in this study made it difficult to identify a particular viral infection leading to increased likelihood of PA acquisition.Discussion: Antibody titers against certain PA antigens can diagnose PA pulmonary infections 6-12 months before the organism is isolated from oropharyngeal cultures. Therefore, performing such titers after every viral infection, may better demonstrate a correlation between viral infections and the initial PA acquisition. In addition, it might provide information on the type of virus that is most likely paving the way for PA colonization and lung damage before respiratory symptoms appear. There might be a role of vaccines against some of these viruses in children with cystic fibrosis.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF42": {"text": ", Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences \u2212 Poznan, Poland; 2 Pediatric Radiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences \u2212 Poznan, Poland) Galectin 9 belongs to the family of glycoproteins interacting with glycoconjugates present at the cell surface that regulate proliferation and apoptosis.

We analyzed 31 CF patients and 20 healthy controls aged 6-18 years. Patients were assessed twice: during pulmonary exacerbation (PE) and during stable period.

If clinical and radiographic indices are considered, it can be defined as slow resolution of radiographic infiltrates or clinical symptoms despite adequate antibiotic therapy. There are several components to successful resolution, including clinical improvement, radiographic resolution, and microbiological eradication. Improvement in vital parameters usually occurs in 2-3 days, and most patients note subjective improvement within 3-5 days of treatment. Radiographic resolution of pneumonia is estimated at 3-4 weeks and microbiological eradication is very variable and dependent on the infectious agent. If resolution of pneumonia is not appropriate, additional evaluation should be done. Considering the fact that non-resolving pneumonia is not a common condition, comorbid diseases and other host factors that can be associated with slower resolution of infiltrates should be investigated.Case report: A 3.5-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital for diagnostic evaluation of recurrent pneumonias and bronchitis. Until the age of 3, he was already treated for 4 radiologically and clinically confirmed pneumonias, 3 of which were treated inpatient. By the time he was admitted for planned additional diagnostics, he had already had an adenoidectomy because of previously found adenoid hypertrophy.Allergy tests were conducted as well as 24-hour pH-metry of the esophagus with impedance and cardiological evaluation, which were all normal. Chest X-ray repeatedly showed bilateral infiltrations.Flexible bronchoscopy showed diffusely edematous bronchial mucosa with abundant turbid secretion, without any anatomical abnormalities or foreign bodies. Immunoelectrophoresis showed decreased levels of IgG (4.6 g/L) and IgM (0.3 g/L) with normal levels of IgA (0.7 g/L). Consequently, further immunological evaluation was performed. Lymphocyte flow cytometry immunophenotyping showed a decreased absolute number of CD4 + CD8-(T helper cells), therapy was started. Since then, the boy has been receiving his therapy in monthly intervals and no new pneumonias were verified. Conclusion: We present CVID in a boy who was initially diagnosed with non-resolving pneumonia. In children with non-resolving pneumonia, detailed immunological evaluation should be performed.

Pediatric Pulmonology, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical School \u2212 Konya, Turkey We report on an association of immunodeficiency and juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis (JLP) in a pediatric-aged patient. A fiveyear-old female patient was referred from another center with suspicion of brochiectasis. Her tomography was reported as fibrotic changes due to necrotic pneumonia. She had an atypical facial appearance, bilateral rales and rhonchi on her physical examination. It was learned that she had recurrent upper respiratory airway infections frequently. Because of the medical history of recurrent lung infections, immunological investigations and flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia were performed, showing vocal cords and upper 1/3 trachea were normal. Papillovesicular lesions were extending from the trachea towards the right main bronchus. Part of the lesions was bundle. Swab sample and lavage were tested for HPV-6 and HPV-11. In immunological tests, there was a decrease in the number of CD 16 (+) and CD 56 (+) T lymphocytes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (CD16/56: 2), as well as in immunoglobulins, particularly IgG3 (11 mg/dl). Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was initiated and she has been investigated for immunodeficiency and genetics. Juvenile Laryngeal Papillomatosis may present with cough, stridor, hoarseness or dysphagia, as well as pneumonia. Laryngeal papillomatosis is the most common benign laryngeal tumor in children. It is generally diagnosed before five years of age. It is thought to be caused by acquisition of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vertically during labor of an infected mother. Genetic variability related to the immune system may represent one of the most effective factors in the development of caused HPV. Due to localization and detection of immunodeficiency, we found this of interest. In children with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), both acid refluxes (AR) and weakly acidic refluxes (WAR) can induce respiratory symptoms (RS). Methods: In order to characterize the airway inflammation in children with more prevalent WAR or AR (defined according to a ROC curve analysis), we performed a 3-year retrospective review of the medical records of patients who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy for difficult-to-treat chronic/recurrent respiratory symptoms and who had a positive multiple intraluminal esophageal impedance (pH/MII) monitoring. Results: In the 13 WAR and 11 AR children, the number of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was similar [). A neutrophilic alveolitis and an elevated lipid-ladenmacrophage (LLM) index were detected in both groups: no differences were found in neutrophils and lymphocyte percentages or in LLM index between WAR and AR children. In contrast, higher BAL epithelial cell proportions were seen in WAR [10.4 (4.85-23.45)], as compared to AR [2.5 (1.25-7.25)] children (P = 0.0045), suggesting greater airway damage in the former.

These substances are ubiquitous in connective tissues, hence the manifestations are broad and challenging, with no treatment. A chest X-ray film was obtained showing pneumonia. He was admitted to the pediatric pulmonology department. Physical examination revealed a short neck, growth delay and an abnormal facies. The three-dimensional reconstruction derived from the chest CT scans was performed, showing laryngotracheal stenosis. An electronic bronchofibroscopy was suggested for comprehensive evaluation of upper and lower airways and safe airway management. However, his parents rejected. Simultaneously, considering the risk of anesthesia, surgery was also rejected. Telephone follow-up was conducted every month. His parents noted that he had been in his usual state of health except for intermittent cough with difficult recovery. Discussion: MPS, mainly MPS type I, II, and VI, are complicated by severe obstruction of the upper airways, tracheobronchial malacia, and/or stenosis of the lower airways resulting from the abnormal degradation of glycosaminoglycans which can result in severe, potentially fatal, difficulties during anesthetic procedures. Significant, multi-factorial airway compromise may occur already in early childhood. Airway obstructions may be localized in any of the physiological airways, from the nose to the peripheral bronchia. Insufficient understanding or insufficient emphasis will result in serious consequences, especially in grass-roots hospitals. Safe airway management necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and combined surgeries. 3D CT and bronchoscopy provide quantitative and morphological evaluation of airway stenosis, which is favorable to airway management in MPS children.

Forced vital capacity (FVC) is an effective marker of respiratory failure evolution. FVC peaks between ages 9 and 16 and then decreases by 5-10% per year until ventilatory support is required for survival. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective treatment for respiratory failure. End-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a frequent finding in DMD patients, but they are rarely candidates for cardiac transplantation, thus left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) can be used as a bridge-to-transplantation or as a destination therapy. The aim of our study was to analyze the diurnal and nocturnal respiratory assessment, survival, death rate and causes of death in DMD patients with LVAD. Methods: FVC, polysomnography (PSG), nocturnal pulsoximetry, mean transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO2) pre-and post-LVAD, survival and causes of death were recorded.

Causes of death were respectively brain hemorrhage during anticoagulant treatment, septic shock from lung infection and iatrogenic tracheal rupture in another hospital. Three patients are alive at 2 \u00b1 0.3 years after surgery. Conclusion: LVAD does not affect the natural decline of respiratory function in DMD patients, whom require NIV to treat the ventilatory failure and to ensure their survival.

She was treated with antibiotics (cefuroxim) with a rapid clinical improvement, but with a persistent atelectasis of the RML, despite physiotherapy. A few weeks later, fever relapsed, demonstrating again pneumonia in the RML. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing mucus plugging in the RML, which was subsequently removed. No anatomical abnormalities were seen. Intrapulmonary percussion ventilation physiotherapy was started.

A 3D-reconstruction of the CTimages could precisely demonstrate the aspect of Congenital rib malformations are a rare cause of compression atelectasis and subsequent chronic inflammation of the lung. This case emphasizes the importance of also considering extrapulmonary anatomical anomalies in cases of relapsing lung problems in the same lobe. H113 \u2212 Why Children with Pectus Excavatum Experience Exercise Intolerance? Cardiopulmonary Function at Rest and on Exercise in Children with Pectus Excavatum. Institute, Schneider Children's Medical Center \u2212 Petach Tikva, Israel; 2 Department of Surgery, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel \u2212 Israel Introduction: Patients with pectus excavatum (PE) frequently experience shortness of breath and aerobic capacity limitation. However, it is unclear whether there is an objective limitation of the cardiorespiratory system. In the 1990's, a minimally invasive procedure for PE repair (Nuss procedure) was introduced. The aims of the study were to assess whether there are cardiorespiratory limitations in these children at rest or during exercise. Methods: A retrospective study. Demographic parameters, clinical symptoms and PE severity of all children assessed for PE at the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel were extracted and evaluated. Baseline pulmonary functions including volumes (total lung capacity-TLC, forced vital capacity-FVC and residual volume-RV, tidal volume \u2212TV), flows (forced expiratory volume in one second-FEV1), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were performed in all children.Results: 140 children (111 boys, mean age 14.3 \u00b1 3.6y) with PE were assessed in 2004-2015. Lung volumes at rest and flows were found to be normal with no difference between patients with chest pain or exercise intolerance and asymptomatic patients. However, severe PE was associated with lower lung volumes and lower tidal volume at rest.Dead space volume (VD) at rest was found to be higher in the moderate-severe group (VD/VT-42 + 7% vs. 37 + 4%; p = 0.004).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF50": {"text": "Children with PE have normal pulmonary functions at rest.

Medicine, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca \u2212 Salamanca, Spain; 2 Respiratory Sleep Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children \u2212 London, United Kingdom Background: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders affecting neuromuscular transmission, characterized by fatigable weakness that varies in severity, including respiratory failure. The presence and severity of sleepdisordered breathing (SDB) is poorly documented in this population. Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation and the role of cardiorespiratory polygraphy (CRP), including capnography, in determining the presence of SDB and need for respiratory intervention, including ventilatory support. Methods: Review of medical records and CRPs performed (Embla S4500; Software REMlogic ver 2) in all children with CMS referred to the Sleep Unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) 2003-2017. Results: We identified 23 cases (15 girls) of CMS referred by neurologists to exclude SDB and/or hypoventilation. 4/23 children were established on ventilatory support before the referral and the CRP was performed on it. The median age at the first CRP was 8.3 years (range 0.3-16.8 years). The CRP was abnormal in 9/23 cases (39%). It showed six cases of SDB (five of them with hypoventilation) with three of these showing symptoms of obstructive SDB at the time of referral. The other three cases had hypoventilation without obstruction (all of whom were on Bi-Level pressure ventilation at the time on the study). We started positive pressure ventilatory support in 4 cases and optimized it in 4 patients (all of whom already established on ventilation).Conclusions:The CRP with capnography has been useful in our study in order to determine the most appropriate time to commence long term ventilation or to optimize ventilation settings in patients already established on ventilatory support.Background: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death. Children exposed to second (SHSe) and third hand smoke(THSe) are at risk for smoke-related morbidity and have limited options for avoiding exposure. Tobacco smoke exposure increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, lower respiratory tract infections, middle ear disease, severe asthma, and slowed lung growth. 1,2 Every possible effort should be made to decrease the burden of tobaccorelated diseases.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)3  , the AmericanCollege of Chest Physicians (ACCP)4  , and many international organizations have published guidelines to assist physicians in tobacco prevention, control, and treatment.

Salise R., Tuazon A. Pediatrics, University of the Philippines, Philippines General Hospital \u2212 Manila, Philippines Introduction: A. Rationale \u2212 Healthcare costs have increased through the years. Nosocomial infections increase morbidity, mortality, and cost and length of stay far beyond what is expected based on the underlying disease state. Hospital-acquired infections generate substantial economic burdens not just for the patient but for the hospital resources as well. It is important that we find other ways to prevent nosocomial infection from occurring in the first place. B. Objective \u2212 The main objective of this study is to determine if supplementation with arginine will have an effect on nosocomial infection rate versus placebo in critically ill pediatric patients. C. Significance of the Study \u2212 The efficacy of arginine supplementation to prevent nosocomial infection among critically ill children has not been well established. Various studies have yielded contradictory conclusions and are mostly among adults. Methodology: A. Study design \u2212 Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. B. Study setting \u2212 This research was conducted in the UP Philippine General Hospital Pediatric Emergency Room, Pediatric wards and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. C. Study participants \u2212 Eligible patients aged 1-17 years old who are critically ill and necessitate ICU admission were enrolled in the study with the following inclusion criteria: critically ill patients who necessitate ICU admission who will be admitted for at least 3 days, able to tolerate oral feeding, no malabsorption diseases, have no immunodeficiency, have no congestive heart failure, are well nourished or are not severely malnourished, have no severe burns, have no nosocomial infection during 1st day of admission from other institution and are not allergic to arginine.E. Statistical Analysis \u2212 Sample size was calculated using the Epi Info software Version 7 based on the assumption that the use of arginine will result in a 20% reduction in the occurrence of nosocomial infection. It was estimated using a nosocomial infection rate of 44% and a confidence interval of 90% with 80% power, we needed 22 children per group to show a 20% difference. To allow for study withdrawal, a total of 50 patients were recruited, 25 patients per arm. Data were analyzed using Epi Info Version 7 software.

It is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In recent years, epidemiological characteristics of M. pneumoniae infection have changed; in the last a few years macrolide-resistance M. pneumoniae strains have also become common. Further epidemiological studies are needed to find answers to this phenomenon.Methods(1) Study population: patients seen at fever clinic for on-site investigation of M. pneumoniae respiratory tract infections.(2) The clinical data of the subjects were obtained by questionnaire, medical history collection, physical examination and assistant examination.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF57": {"text": "Pharyngeal swab acquisition and DNA detection: after acquisition of pharyngeal throat swabs from subjects, we detected M. pneumoniae-DNA by real-time PCR method. For some objects, we conducted long-time monitoring for M. pneumoniae-DNA in pharyngeal swabs to observe the carrying duration of M. pneumoniae after infection and to observe its relationship with the progression of the disease. (4) Culture and isolation of M. pneumoniae strains: throat swab was inoculated to M. pneumoniae solid medium, and the isolation, liquid culture and PCR validation were carried out. (5) Drug resistance analysis and mutation detection of M. pneumoniae strains: isolated strains were detected and analyzed for macrolideresistance, and the mutation points were confirmed. (6) Molecular typing of M. pneumoniae strains: all isolates were detected by MLVA molecular genotyping. Parts of strains were also detected by P1 gene typing. The two types of molecular genotyping methods were compared. We also explored the significance of MLVA typing in molecular characters in M. pneumoniae infection.ResultsA total of 1025 patients were enrolled. Among these, 163 were M. pneumoniae-DNA positive, with a positive rate of 15.09%. We found that M. pneumoniae infection tended to occur in children over the age of 5 years, summer and autumn were epidemic seasons, and pneumonia was the most common form of M. pneumoniae infection.Multiple regression analysis found that M. pneumonia. M. pneumoniae carrying time varied according to different parts of M. pneumoniae infection: pneumonia was the longest, bronchitis the second, and URI the shortest. A total of 94 M. pneumoniae strains were isolated from M. pneumoniae-DNA positive patients, with an isolation rate of 57.7%. MLVA typing distinguished the strains into 8 types. Except for 2 strains, all the other 92 strains (97.9%) were macrolide-resistant strains. The 2 macrolide-sensitive strains had a special MLVA type.Conclusion M. pneumoniae infection tended to occur in children over the age of 5 years, summer and autumn were epidemic seasons, and pneumonia was the most common form of M. pneumoniae infection. Thus, M. pneumoniae is an important pathogen of CAP. Age, severity of disease and multiple siblings were risk factors of M. pneumoniae infection. Macrolide-resistant strains were predominant at present. MLVA genotyping may be a molecular epidemiological method of predicting macrolide-resistant strains of M. pneumoniae infection.[Key words] Mycoplasma pneumoniae; surveillance; PCR real-time; outbreak; MLVA; genotyping I98 \u2212 Problematic Asthma: Risk Factors for the Persistence of Symptoms and Assessment of Features Distinguishing Difficult-to-Treat from Severe Asthma Negro V. Respiratory Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS \u2212 Rome, Italy Introduction: Problematic Asthma (PA) is characterized by an apparent resistance to therapy with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other controllers. Although PA represents a small percentage of cases of asthma, the severity of its clinical manifestations affects the quality of life and has an economic impact on health care costs. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of asthma and excluding rare cases of steroidresistant asthma, difficult-to-treat asthma (DA) must be distinguished from severe asthma (SA). DA is the term that characterizes asthmatic patients with a poor control of symptoms depending on different factors: poor compliance, environmental triggers, presence of comorbidity.SA is instead present when adequate control of asthma cannot be achieved by high-dose ICS and additional controllers (long-acting inhaled beta 2 agonists, montelukast and/or theophylline) or by oral corticosteroid treatment or is lost when the treatment is reduced.The 2014 ATS / ERS Guidelines on SA underline the importance of discriminating the two entities for which the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are different. During the first clinical evaluation, it is therefore important to identify severity markers that can suggest the diagnostic procedure to be undertaken.Methods:We compared a group of patients with PA (n = 51) that were referred to our Broncopneumology clinic between The aim of the study was to analyze the presence of risk factors determining the persistence of respiratory symptoms and identify anamnestic and instrumental data that allow an early identification of DA and SA, in order to optimize the therapy and direct more in-depth investigations only to those who warrant it.Results: The PA group showed a significantly higher number of hospital admissions (p = 0.03), the presence of smoking parents (p = 0.03) and a compliance index in performing therapy statistically lower (p = 0.001). The analysis of a subgroup of patients suffering from SA (n = 14) compared with the DA group (n = 37), showed that in the first group there was a higher frequency of hospital admissions (p = 0.04), the presence of food allergies from the first months of life (p = 0.0001) and a reduction in respiratory function, expressed by reduced values of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), at the limit of statistical significance (p = 0.06). Conclusions: The identification of environmental, instrumental and anamnestic risk factors can reduce the number of more in-depth investigations that should be addressed to those cases that are warranted. By facilitating an early distinction between patients with DA and SA, therapy will be optimized, reducing the severity and recurrence of respiratory symptoms and consequently the need for additional medical care.

Soto Lavin S. 1 , Niklitschek Soto S. 2 , Pizarro J. 3 , Meza F. 4 , Silva N. 4 1 Pediatric Pulmonology unit, Hospital Regional \u2212 Concepcion, Chile; 2 Statistics, Universidad de Concepcion \u2212 Concepcion, Chile; 3 Medicine Faculty, UdeC \u2212 Concepcion, Chile; 4 Pediatric Dept, UdeC \u2212 Concepcion, Chile Introduction: Asthma is a chronic respiratory manifestation including symptoms, genetic aspects, different response to treatment guidelines and is underdiagnosed in childhood. It produces missing days at school and a very expensive cost when it is undercontrolled. The prevalence is 15 to 18% and 4% will have severe asthma with a high risk of requiring emergency management and hospitalization. Method: Included were all children between 5 and 15 years old, hospitalized in the Pediatric Service at Hospital Regional Concepcion in Chile (HCRC) because of asthmatic crisis from October 2013 to July 2016. There were 129 children in this situation and their files were reviewed. Statistical analysis was made with clustering data mining. Results: The median value for age was 6 years old (5-15), with no differences regarding gender, cough 1 to 10 days (mean 2 days), fever 1 day or less (>38\u00b0C) (mean 1 day), 98% respiratory distress, initial O2 saturation 79 to 97% with digital equipment (mean 91%), white cell count from 7300 to 21790 (mean 13015), neutrophils from 46 to 96% (mean 88%), C-Reactive Protein (PCR) from 0.2 to 64 (normal < 10) (mean 11.35), days in pediatric service at hospital from 1 to 14 days (mean 3 days),oxygen requirement < 1 to 12 days (mean 2 days). The analysis separated all of these patients into 4 subgroups. Their characteristics wereat hospital, without any abnormality at chest X-ray, mean of neutrophils 20%, mean of eosinophils 1440 (Q1 = 930, Q3 = 2560). Subgroup IV: they came mainly from one area Chiguayante, age did not vary, most were under medical supervision with their family doctor, cough 4.5 days (Q1 = 3, Q3 = 6), without fever, without respiratory distress, oxygen saturation 92% (Q1 = 90, Q3 = 95), virus (\u2212), mycoplasma (\u2212), mean for neutrophils 52.5% (Q1 = 26.75, Q3 = 67.75), PCR 17.25 (Q1 = 7.3, Q3 = 32.33), oxygen supply 2 days (Q1 = 2, Q3 = 3), 4 days at hospital, azithromicin 40%, clarithromycin 30%, chest X-ray without pneumonia only inflammation signs, eosinophils 685 (Q1 = 495, Q3\u00d1 = 1400). Conclusion: Pediatric patients with severe asthma in crisis, hospitalized in Hospital de Concepcion from 2013 to 2016, of Pediatric Pulmonology, China Medical University Children's Hospital \u2212 Taichung, Taiwan; 2 Sleep Medicine Center, Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan \u2212 Taichung, Taiwan Background: Sleep problems in children are relatively fewer than in adults, but cannot be overlooked. Polysomnography (PSG) is an important method to diagnose sleep problems in adults, diagnoses in 101 female patients were as follows: 45 obstructive (44.6 %), 31 snoring (30.7%), 17 limb movement sleep disorder (16.8%), 13 other sleep-related breathing disorder (12.9%), 11 insomnias (5.3%), 7 central (3.3%), 7 parasomnias (3.3%), 4 hypersomnias (1.9%), 2 sleep seizure (0.9%) and 2 sleep terrors (0.9%). Management of 270 patients (40 patients did not return to OPD for follow-up) was as follows: surgery with adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy in 19 patents (7.0%), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in 2 patients (0.7%), and medical treatment or observation in 249 patients (92.2%). Conclusion: The majority cause in children with sleep problems was obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) (49.6%), while only 12.3% of pediatric OSAS underwent surgery in our study, which is underestimated since some children with OSAS underwent surgery without performing PSG. PSG may help detect significant sleep-related problems and application of PSG results is useful for therapeutic decisions in children; we suggest that children with sleep problems should accept a PSG study.

Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Stollery Children's Hospital \u2212 Edmonton, Canada A 10y old female with a history of complex congenital heart disease and Fontan physiology, presented to our institution with severe respiratory distress. She was diagnosed with plastic bronchitis and was treated with manual casts removal by rigid bronchoscopy. Due to her unstable condition, she was subsequently treated with high pressure ventilation, nitric oxide and inotropes. To facilitate potential cast resolution, she was also treated with tracheal installation of TPA as well as Alteplase and budesonide inhalations; however, her condition did not improve. A wide variety of imaging including chest X-ray, echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization failed to identify the etiology of her presentation. and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Many cases are still labeled as idiopathic {Rubin BK}. A new recent diagnostic technique, DCMRL-Dynamic Contrast Magnetic Resonance Lymphangiography, has identified abnormal anatomic lymphatic variants as the cause for cast formation in many previous idiopathic cases {Dori Y}. This diagnostic technique improved our understanding of PB and enabled a new optimal therapeutic approach. The reasons why this new procedure has become our first-choice imaging technique are summarized in table 1. Our patient's DCMRL showed markedly abnormal intrathoracic lymphatics. The thoracic duct (TD) was dilated and tortuous, coursing towards the innominate vein on the left. In addition, there was abnormal perfusion affecting mostly the right lung with largely sparing of the left lung. There was also an additional left-sided accessory thoracic duct supplying retrograde flow to the lungs. Last, there was flow into a large left-sided supraclavicular and axillary network. Following the diagnostic procedure, selective embolization of the lymphatic collaterals from distal TD and selective embolization of the left sided duct were performed.

Masarweh K., Gur M., Toukan Y., Hakim F., Bar-Yoseph R., Nir V., Bentur L. Pediatric Pulmonary Institute and CF Center, Ruth Rappaport Children's Hospital, Rambam Health Care Campus \u2212 Haifa, Israel Background: Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is a global measurement of ventilation inhomogeneity, and it was recently suggested as an outcome measure for clinical trials in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). However, the test requires expensive equipment and expertise. Six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple non-invasive and inexpensive tool to predict outcome in pulmonary hypertension. Recently it has been used in CF to evaluate candidates for lung transplantation and to predict exacerbations. Both LCI and 6MWT were found as useful markers in Bronchiolits Obliterans (BO). In BO, 6MWT was found to have an important prognostic value and demonstrated a significant correlation with clinical scores and pulmonary function tests. There are no studies in CF and post-infectious BO evaluating the correlation between the 6MWT results, LCI and Quality of Life (QOL). Such correlation may enable easy and non-expensive tests when resources are limited. Objective: To evaluate the correlations between 6MWT, LCI, and quality of life in patients with BO and CF patients. Methods: This is a prospective study including patients with BO and CF. Patients performed 6MWT, LCI test, spirometry, whole body plethysmography, MVV (minute ventilatory ventilation), and Quality of Life questionnaire \u2212 SF-36.The primary outcome parameters were defined as 6MWT in both groups.

Mileva S., Petrova G., Yankova M., Isaev V., Kabakchieva R. Pediatric Department, Alexandrovska Hospital, Medical University \u2212 Sofia, Bulgaria Background: Bronchiolitis is a diagnosis that is based on clinical criteria. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Material and Methods: This was an observational study of 43 infants, 1 to 23 mo of age (average age 8.34), hospitalized in the \"Alexandrovska\" pediatric clinic with bronchiolitis for the period December 2016-March 2017. Ultrasound scans were performed in all patients in the first 24 hours of admission (linear transducer 5.3-11 MHz, with portable ultrasound) and chest X-ray in 35 children. Tests for respiratory viruses (PCR method) were undertaken in 32 patients. Results: Lung ultrasound findings did not depend on the etiological agent, p = 0.5. Children without chest X-ray changes had normal ultrasound findings in 85% (11/13) of cases. In all patients with severe bronchiolitis, on oxygen treatment (8/8), ultrasonographic changes were recorded, p = 0.001. There was a correlation between the length of hospital stay and degree of ultrasound changes (p = 0.02). Lung ultrasound enabled the identification of infants with underlying radiological changes with a specificity of 84.6% (95% C: 54.5-98.%) and sensitivity of 80% (95% Cl: 59.3-93, 1%), a positive predictive value of 90.9% (95% Cl: 72.2-97.1%) and a negative predictive value of 68.7 (95% Cl: 49.2-83.3%). Conclusions: Thoracic ultrasonography is a reliable tool and alternative to chest X-ray for infants with bronchiolitis, with some advantages: no risk of irradiation and the possibility of dynamic follow-up. Keywords: lung ultrasound, bronchiolitis, infants. Dai ZK., Chen IC., Liu IC., Hsu JH. Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital \u2212 Kaohsiung, Taiwan Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive pulmonary vascular disorder characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arteriolar remodeling. Wnt signaling controls cellular functions during embryonic development and the injury of acquired tissues. \u03b2-catenin is a central mediator of the Wnt signaling pathway and controls the transcription of genes during both normal and malignant development. Recently, a gene expression analysis of pulmonary arterial resistance vessels revealed differentially regulated canonical and noncanonical WNT genes in PAH. Aim: In this study, we attempted to investigate the altered expression of Wnt and Wnt-related proteins of lungs of rats with PH secondary to left ventricular dysfunction by aortic banding, so-called group II PH. Materials and methods: Utilizing the PH rat model created by ascending aortic banding for 42 days (6 weeks), we studied altered expressions of \u03b2-catenin, mRNA and protein expression of canonical Wnt ligands (Wnt3a, Wnt 7a) and non-canonical Wnt ligands (Wnt5a and Wnt11) in lungs of 6 week-aorta-banded rats compared to shamoperated rats. In addition, the immunohistological staining of \u03b2-catenin of lungs was also performed in both groups Results: In lungs of aorta-banded rats, there were significantly increased protein expressions of Wnt5a, Wnt11 and Wnt5a, and significantly decreased protein expression of \u03b2-catenin. In contrast, there were increased mRNA expressions of Wnt 2, FZD5 and Ltb, and decreased mRNA expressions of Wnt3a, Wnt7a, Wif, sFRP1, sFRP2. Very interestingly, there was decreased \u03b2-catenin staining of endothelium in lungs of aorta-banded rats. Discussion: In group II PH secondary to left ventricular dysfunction, the development of PH is closely related to the non-canonical Wnt pathway prominently, rather than the canonical Wnt pathway. The results are compatible with the up-regulated Rho expression of lungs of aorta-banded rats in our previous study. J114 \u2212 Is It Possible to Predict Airway Basement Membrane Thickness by Non-invasive Parameters? patients with chronic bronchitis (CB group) including those with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and other forms of chronic bronchitis (e.g. related to primary immunodeficiency), who underwent clinically indicated flexible bronchoscopy. Additionally 20 controls (Co group) \u2212 that is, patients with bronchoscopy for acute non-inflammatory conditions (foreign body aspiration, stridor) and no chronic respiratory pathology \u2212 were enrolled. The age of our patients ranged from 1 to 18 years (median 8.6 years). At first, all patients underwent lung function testing using nitrogen multiple breath washout test (N2-MBW) and tidal breath analysis. All relevant international recommendations were adhered to. Patients older than 4 years performed the testing in full consciousness and with active cooperation. In younger children, lung function testing was performed during tidal breathing under intravenous anesthesia (propofol) immediately before the bronchoscopy. Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial forceps biopsy was performed in the same session after addition of inhaled anesthesia (sevoflurane). The samples were processed for light microscopy and stained by hematoxylin-eosin. BM width was measured by one investigator (VK) using computer image analysis software (NIS Elements). The two study groups were compared using the Welch t test. The relationship between non-invasive parameters (anthropometrical and functional) and BM width was analyzed in the whole study group (CB + Co group). At first, Spearmen's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship of each single non-invasive parameter with BM width. Next, more advanced approaches (principal component analysis, least angle regression method) enabling analysis of multiple predictors simultaneously were employed to evaluate the possibility of making BM width predictions using more non-invasive parameters at the same time. There were no differences in age and z-scores relative to weight, height or BMI of patients enrolled in the CB and Co groups. Complete lung function and morphological data were available in 43 patients (64.2%). Patients in the CB group had significantly greater BM width (\u0394 BM width = 1.13 \u00b5m, P < 0.001) and worse lung function compared to controls. When analyzed separately, none of the anthropometrical parameters alone (weight, height, BMI and their z-scores) correlated significantly with BM width. When more anthropometrical parameters were taken into account simultaneously, a small but significant part of BM width variability (R2 = 0.111, p = 0.036) could be explained. Only a few lung function parameters individually were significantly correlated with BM width: LCI2.5-r = 0.42, p = 0.008; Scond \u2212 r = 0.51, p < 0.001 and tPTEF/tE \u2212 r = \u22120.39, p = 0.013.

This finding is in contrast with several previous studies. Hilliard et al (Thorax, 2007) found significant relationship between lung function (measured by spirometry) and inflammation occurring in airway lumen (assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). On the other hand, changes occurring in airway wall (BM width) were not reflected by spirometry. Contrarily to this, we proved a significant relationship between ventilation inhomogeneity (as assessed by N2-MBW) and BM width. This discrepancy may be partly explained by the higher sensitivity of N2-MBW to the early stages of chronic respiratory diseases. Similarly, previous works addressing anthropometrical parameters as determinants of BM width did not reveal any relationship. Our approach, however, studied additional anthropometrical parameters as BM width determinants simultaneously, and indeed we were able to explain a small but significant part of BM width variability in this way. We hypothesize that this relationship is too complex to be described by just one determinant. Consequently, we combined both anthropometrical and functional parameters in one predictive model which further increased the predictive power of this model for BM width variability \u2212 reaching 62.1%. In our opinion, such predictive power is sufficiently high to be considered clinically relevant. However there still remains significant variability to be explained by other parameters (e.g. diagnosis itself). This finding requires further research before it can be implemented into routine care of patients with chronic bronchitis.

J132 \u2212 Utility of Flexible Bronchoscopy in Children with Cancer. Naseeb A. 1 , Toorani M. 1 , Chong KN. 2 , Narayan O. 3 1 Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland \u2212 Medical University of Bahrain \u2212 Manchester, United Kingdom; 2 Medicine, University of Malaya \u2212 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; 3 Respiratory Paediatrics, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital \u2212 Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: Flexible bronchoscopy is widely recognized as an important diagnostic and therapeutic procedure utilized by pulmonologists worldwide, allowing the physician to perform a wide range of interventions including obtaining samples from a broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). The flexible bronchoscopy is relatively safe but procedural complications reported in the literature include the standard risks of anesthesia, oxygen desaturations, airway bleeding and cough. (1) The role of bronchoscopy and BAL in pediatric oncology is not well established in the literature. We looked at 5-year data at a large tertiary center in the United Kingdom. Methods: We retrospectively looked at all flexible bronchoscopies conducted on cancer patients with persistent fever at a pediatric tertiary care facility over a five-year period. We looked at the results of the BAL and determined if there were modifications in clinical management attributable to the bronchoscopy.Results: A total of 21 patients were identified with 26 corresponding flexible bronchoscopies with BAL. Diagnosis of these children were as follows: 7 with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), 7 with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), 1 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 1 T-Cell Lymphoblastic Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, 1 B-Cell Lymphoblastic (Burkitt's like) Lymphoma, 1 Ewing's Sarcoma, 1 Neuroblastoma, 1 Pontine Brainstem Tumor, and 1 Ewing's Sarcoma. Seven of these patients had a stem cell transplantation. which were repeat bronchoscopies. All patients who had their treatment modified were either diagnosed with ALL or AML. Two of these patients had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. The organisms identified on BAL were as follows: Pneumocystis jirovecii in 2 cases, Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 1 case, Adenovirus in 1 case, Influenza A in 1 case. A negative BAL ruled out fungal infection in 1 patient enabling a high dose systemic steroid therapy. Conclusion: Our single-center study shows that bronchoscopies in oncologic pediatric patients are useful and yield a change in the clinical management in a significant portion of a population (23%). Children with common cancers such as ALL and AML end up receiving more interventional procedures for persistent fever. There was no clear association with treatment modification and bone marrow or stem cell transplant patients, as only 2 of the 7 bone marrow or stem cell transplants had their treatment modified (28.5%). Further multi-center research with a larger sample size is warranted to fully evaluate the role of bronchoscopies in future management. directionality in all children with a cough during more than 4 weeks. But patients with cough due to allergic diseases of the respiratory tract (Gr2, 6) were characterized by significant deformation of the arterial part of the capillaries and an increase in the length of the perivascular areas (L) compared with children with infectious genesis of cough (Gr1,3,4,5), in whom changes were often observed in the parameters of the venous part of the capillaries (p < 0.05). This may indicate \u0430 persistence of the chronic allergic inflammation in patients with AR (Gr2) and BA (Gr6). A more pronounced increase of L was observed in children with BA under 7 years old compared with patients older than 7 years (P < 0.05). Gr2 and Gr6 were characterized by the prevalence of parasympathicus activity (at HRV analysis): increase in RMSSD, pNN50% and SDNN compared with Gr1,3,4,5, C (\u0440 < 0,05). A more pronounced imbalance of autonomic regulation was found in patients with BA (Gr6): increase in VLF and reduction in HF, LF compared with Gr2 (\u0440 < 0.05). HRV parameters of Gr1,3,4,5 had a similar orientation as the predominance tone of the sympathicus (SNS): reduction in RMSSD, pNN50%, HF and increase in VLF \u0438 LF compared with Gr2,6, C (p < 0.05). The Gr5 was characterized by more pronounced activity of the SNS (P < 0,05). This may indicate a high degree of tension in the adaptive mechanisms of the VNS in children with PIC (Gr5). Patients with acute wheezing (Gr4) and BA (Gr6) showed a higher level of the coefficient of acoustic component of the work of breathing in the high frequency zone (5.0-12.6 kHz) (\u03d53), compared with Gr1,2,3,5,C (P < 0.05). Test with standard dose of salbutamol was positive in both Gr, although a more pronounced decrease in \u03d53 (26-72%) was typical for BA (Gr6) (P < 0,01). Based on the data obtained, the clinical and functional parameters of the microcirculation and VNS for differential diagnosis of the allergic and infectious genesis of coughs during more than 4 weeks in patients with PNDS were determined: a rise in body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C; increased cough during exercise; a level of total IgE in blood serum; L and the coefficient of tortuosity of the arterial part of the capillaries; SDNN. As additional criteria for diagnosing BA in children with a cough during more than 4 weeks, the following clinical and functional parameters are proposed: degree of the allergenic condition of the patient; L; the unevenness of the caliber of capillaries; HF; LF; \u03d53. Conclusion: These results showed that the functional parameters of the microcirculation, VNS and respiratory system can be used as additional criteria for the differential diagnosis of the allergic or infectious genesis of prolonged and chronic cough in children. It can be important in relation to early diagnostics of BA in children. : A new technology, Pulse CO-Oximetry, provides a continuous and noninvasive estimate of both hemoglobin concentration and SpO2 from a sensor placed on the extremity. In other words, it may be possible to measure pulmonary and hemodynamic condition without collection of blood at the same time in a noninvasive method as usual. Neonates often undergo a significant decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) due to immaturity of hematopoietic function and frequently undergo blood tests, when medical intervention is required. Because neonates and infants below 3 kg have relatively small circulating blood volume, it is easy for them to develop an iatrogenic anemia resulting from the collection of blood. Therefore noninvasive methods of detecting blood Hb levels may help reduce iatrogenic anemia and pain caused by taking blood. Currently available noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb) devices are aimed at children above 3 kg. However their feasibility for neonates or infants below 3 kg is not known. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether use of SpHb devices appears feasible for neonates or infants below 3 kg. Methods: Subjects: Newborn infants who were scheduled to have a blood test including Hb measurement by blood sampling in NICU of St. Luke's International Hospital. Equipment: A prototype SpHb device and a finger sensor, which have the routine function for SpO2 monitoring, (Masimo Radical-7 ver. 1.1.4.8, sensor 25L rev. K) were used. A sensor was attached to a lower extremity in the same manner as a pulse oximeter sensor with appropriate light shielding. Measurement: SpHb measurement with recording was started about 30 minutes prior to scheduled usual blood sampling (not heel cut). After observing at least 10 minutes of infant stabilization and confirming the stability of SpHb values (\u00b1 1g/dL) for over 5 minutes, venous blood sampling (about 1 ml depending on other concomitant blood tests)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF62": {"text": "The incidence of total peri-operative complications was not different between the two groups (RR 1.09 [CI: 0.42-2.8]; p = 0.8; I2 = 44%; Figure 1); post-operative length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the VATS group (SDM \u22120.6 [CI: \u22121.1--.0.05]; p = 0.03; I2 = 53%; Figure 2); need for re-intervention was significantly lower in the VATS group (RR 0.6 [CI: 0.4-0.9]; p = 0.04; I2 = 22%; . Egger's regression test did not identify significant biases between studies [p>0.3 for all outcomes]. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that VATS and CDF for empyema have similar incidence of peri-operative complications. However, VATS is associated with shorter post-operative hospital stay and a reduced need for re-interventions. In centers with minimally invasive surgery expertise, VATS should be considered the treatment of choice in the surgical management of empyema. K80 \u2212 The Use of Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation with Builtof Pediatrics, Yodogawa Chiristian Hospital \u2212 Osaka City, Japan; 2 Department of Pediatrics, Okada Kodomo No Mori Clinic \u2212 Kasukabe City, Japan Of the children who are brought to the emergency department, respiratory issues are often the cause. As Ueda et al. reported, Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation (BCV) is comfortable, fits easily and the expression of the effect is early. Therefore, we use BCV first to patients with respiratory distress as much as possible. Recently, in patients with respiratory distress, we utilized BCV using the built-in battery, in order to continue medical treatment without interruption during transportation of the sick children from the emergency department", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF63": {"text": ", the treatment conducted by loading the battery with the BCV does not require gas piping, such as oxygen or air. In other words, this treatment is available under the situation in which there is difficulty in gas supply at the time of a disaster. In our country, we experienced certain large-scale disasters and all utilities including electricity and gas supply were thus cut off. BCV can be run only on the battery power supply and can also work under the situation without gas piping, and it is considered to be an effective means even as an acute respiratory management method at the time of disaster.We can use BCV with built-in battery as not only an early intervention in the emergency department, but also as an effective means during transportation and disasters.K84 \u2212 Use of Inhaled Antibiotics (IAb) in Non-CF Chronic Lower Respiratory Infections. Introduction: Based on the experience in CF, there is a growing interest in the use of IAb in non-CF lower respiratory tract infections. Studies have been performed mostly in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, COPD, mycobacterial disease and other infections; applying Ab formulations for inhalation as well as \"off-label\" use of injectable Ab for inhalation. Also, the use of IAb for eradicating organisms such as P. aeruginosa in non-CF bronchiectasis is under investigation. Aim: To investigate tolerance and efficacy of IAb treated non-CF infants and children. Method: Retrospective review of data of all IAb treatment courses in young non-CF subjects in our pediatric department. Results: Eight non-CF subjects (2 boys), age 0-15 years (median 71 months), with chronic colonization of pseudomonas or other resistant species were included. Underlying medical condition: extreme prematurity (GA 24-25 weeks) with O2 dependent BPD (3, including 2 with pulmonary hypertension, 1 with a tracheocanula and 2 on CPAP or BiPap), Down syndrome with GA 34 weeks, severe pulmonary hypertension, O2 dependency and tracheocanula (1), congenital esophageal atresia with tracheal fistula and recurrent aspiration pneumonias with bronchiectasis (1), polymalformative syndrome with mental retardation and intractable respiratory infection (2 adolescents), bronchiectasis after PCP pneumonia in T-cell lymphoma (1 adolescent). Reasons for starting IAb were: absence of response to repetitive IV antibiotic courses, practical issues with IV access, increased ventilatory conditions, recurrent acute exacerbations. Seventy-five percent of treatments were started in hospital; 2 adolescents started IAb in outpatient consultation. Age at start of IAb varied from 4 months to 15 years of age; duration of treatment was from 14 days to several months. IAb utilized were colomycin, amikacin, gentamycin, ceftazidim, in mono or bitherapy, based on sensitivity testing. Doses and preparation were extrapolated from CF guidelines, including use of salbutamol before IAb to avoid bronchial hyperreactivity. Inhalation was well tolerated and safe. Eradication was successful and resulted in clinical improvement, decreased ventilator conditions and less acute exacerbation during a 4 to several months follow-up. Conclusion: Data on the use of IAb in prematures and young children are scarce. These pilot data show that treatment with IAb in selected non-CF subjects with severe respiratory condition is safe and effective. It is feasible in non-hospitalized children and avoids the need for parenteral administration. IAb in non-CF is currently not formally indicated and more scientific evidence from ongoing clinical trials is awaited. K142 \u2212 Open Lung Biopsy for Chronic Pulmonary Disease in Children.

Abdelaziz F. 1 , Khelifi-Touhami T. an 8-year-old girl with a history of recurrent bacterial pneumonia in the right lower lobe since the age of 6 years. Radiological investigations, in particular CT angiography, showed the presence of large cysts and pulmonary condensation located in the apical segment of the lower lobe without signs of pulmonary sequestration. Bronchoscopy did not find any foreign body, granuloma or hydatid cyst membrane retention, the hydatid serologies were negative. The immunological profile did not show any primary or acquired immune deficiency, exploration by pulmonary scintigraphy showed a hypoperfusion of the right lower lobe, pulmonary function testing was normal, no associated cardiac or renal malformation.Regarding all these elements, the diagnosis of CCAM was retained and the child was operated, she underwent a lower right lobectomy with good postoperative evolution. Pathology confirmed CCAM type 1 with large cysts according to the Stoker classification.Case 2: a 26-month-old girl with a history of recurrent chest infections in the right lower lobe since the age of 18 months with respiratory distress that required more than five hospitalizations. The CT scan confirmed the presence of cystic lesions of the right lower lobe and two small cystic lesions of the apical segment of the left lower lobe, with no systemic vessel which eliminated a sequestration. Bronchoscopy was normal as well as hydatid cyst serology, no associated renal or cardiac malformations. The diagnosis of CCAM being retained, the patient was referred to the surgeon for right inferior lobectomy; during surgery it was decided to limit the ablation to the right ventral and paracardial segments, the immediate surgical evolution was good and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of CCAM type 1. Four months later, the child presented a chest infection in the right inflamed lobe, the CT confirmed the presence of cystic lesions of the inferior lobe; however, the left lesions disappeared. A second surgery was performed and an inferior lobectomy was carried out with a good follow-up. Conclusion: None of our two patients was diagnosed at the antenatal period despite ultrasound monitoring during pregnancy. We noticed an important delay in the diagnosis despite clinical and radiological evidence, selective surgery in the second patient failed. Any recurrent chest infections must evoke a CCAM, surgery in this situation is the rule and the only possible treatment.

CT scan showed the cystic lesion contained a few thin internal septations with thoracotomy through the fifth intercostal space. Amultiloculated giant cystic lesion was found occupying the entire hemithorax and compressed all right lower lobes which was the solid round mass. During the mechanical ventilation, this lobe got insufflated recovering its functions normally. The anatomy of the affected lobe appeared normal. The removal of the cystic mass was performed simultaneously with the posterior apical segment of the lower lobe where the lesion was fixed. Grossly, the diameter of the cystic mass was 8.0 cm. Histopathologically, the cystic epithelial layer was composed predominantly of flattened cells and at the subepithelial layer, there were foci of spindle cells with an atypical appearance.

Conclusion: Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) and type 1 Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) are indistinguishable by clinical and radiological presentation. Therefore, children with asymptomatic cystic lesion should be assessed thoroughly and the lesion resected early to avoid later complications such as its malignization.

It is a rare pathology in children, with the median age at diagnosis being 50-60 years. Lung location represents 15% of cases and gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement is the predominant primary location for MALT lymphoma. Unlike the case of GI, MALT lymphoma of the lung has no established association with microbial infections. We present a case of a 16-yearold girl who underwent orthotopic cardiac transplant in infancy and presented with signs and symptoms concerning for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Following recurrent pneumothoraces, she underwent lung biopsy that revealed MALT lymphoma and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Case Report: 16-year-old female with history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post orthotopic cardiac transplant at 1 year of age. Patient had a relatively uncomplicated course until age 15, when persistent cough and declining spirometry triggered a computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen that revealed diffuse lymphadenopathy concerning for PTLD. Laparoscopic mesenteric lymph node biopsy resulted positive for EBV and infectious mononucleosis-like lesion and was followed by mediastinal lymph node biopsy due to uncertainty regarding PTLD, and resulted inconclusive as well. Cough, weight loss and significant decrease in pulmonary function test eventually culminated by recurrent left-sided pneumothoraces, leading to lung biopsy that established MALT lymphoma of the lung as well as infection with EBV. Discussion: Primary lung lymphoma is a rare disorder and represents only 0.3% of all primary pulmonary malignancies. MALT lymphoma is the most frequent subset of primary pulmonary lymphomas. It may present with pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, chest pain, or constitutional symptoms. Our patient developed cough, transplants, often associated with EBV. MALT lymphoma has not been classified as an entity within the spectrum of PTLD, and is infrequently associated to EBV. This report raises the question of such link in this patient with pulmonary MALT lymphoma after orthotopic cardiac transplant and in association to EBV. N129 \u2212 Study on Bacterial Contamination of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in a Pediatric Hospital in Hamadan, West of Iran. Yousefimashouf MR. Medical Microbiology, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences Faculty of Medicine \u2212 Hamadan, Iran Background and aim: Bacterial contamination in hospitals is one of the major problems in hospitals that cause serious damage to humans and society. One of the major causes of the increase in bacterial contamination is misuse of disinfectants and an increase in antibiotics resistance in hospitals. The aims of this study were the evaluation of bacterial contamination of intensive care units (NICU) and determination of antibiotics resistance patterns in isolated bacteria in a Fatemihe hospital, west of Iran. Material and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which 100 samples were randomly collected from environments and apparatus of neonatal intensive care units including washing sink, ward floors, patient beds, phototherapy, oxygen mask, incubator, infant scale, suction and staff fingers. The samples were inoculated into EMB and Blood agar by sterile wet swabs and transferred to the medical laboratory for identification. Strains were tested for antibiogram by NCCLS protocol. The antibiotics disks consisted of: ampicillin, imipenem, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime, erythromycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, cephalexine, cefepime and ciprofloxacin.

Clinically, patients may have productive cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion, sometimes with hemoptysis. Some patients, who have little or no associated sequelae are not diagnosed until they are adults. In the appropriate clinical setting, radiography and CT usually are sufficient to diagnose the condition. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy scans may contribute to diagnosis by showing the displayed characteristic pattern of a matched ventilation and perfusion defect. We have recently observed in patients with complicated pneumonia, by Doppler echocardiography of the pulmonary main arteries, that pulmonary artery blood supply is markedly decreased in the affected lung. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy was compared with Doppler echocardiography of the pulmonary main arteries in a 2-year-old patient recently diagnosed with this syndrome. Case Report: A 2-year-old boy underwent chest radiography in the context of acute bronchitis. Complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe (LLL) and lingula with bronchiectasis, and hyperinflation of the left upper lobe (LUL) with ipsilateral deviation of the mediastinum were observed. He was a healthy child with wheezing episodes triggered by upper respiratory tract infections. There was no history of cough, expectoration, choking, pneumonia or other significant bacterial infections. He was a well-nourished boy without respiratory distress. Lung auscultation showed hypoventilation and crackles in the left hemithorax. No changes in chest X-rays were observed after an oral course of amoxycillin-clavulanate. A pulmonary CT scan showed atelectasis of the entire LLL with bronchiectasis and hypoattenuation of the rest of the lung segments due to air trapping, thickening of the bronchial tree, bronchiectasis in LUL and retention of secretions. In addition, a decreased size of the left pulmonary artery and decreased vasculature of the left lung were observed. The child underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy, discarding the presence of a foreign body, intrabronchial lesion or abnormalities of segmentation. A sample of respiratory secretions was collected, with growing of Haemophilus influenzae. Other studies (tuberculin test, sweat test and immune system evaluation) rendered normal results. Doppler echocardiography showed a clear flow asymmetry between the main pulmonary arteries with a markedly decreased blood flow in the left pulmonary artery. The ratio between the right and the left pulmonary artery flow was estimated at 6.9/1. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy showed a matched severe deterioration of ventilation and perfusion of the left lung (perfusion ratio between right and left lungs 9/1). A diagnosis of SJS was established, and recommendations were made to receive respiratory physiotherapy, anti-flu and pneumococcal vaccination, and early antibiotherapy in case of respiratory exacerbations. Discussion: SJS is considered to be a relatively uncommon and complex disease characterized by unilateral hyperlucency of a such as pneumothorax, emphysema, endobronchial obstruction, hypoplastic lung, pulmonary embolism or agenesis of the pectoralis major muscle. Pulmonary CT is the test of choice for diagnosis, showing destruction of the affected lung parenchyma, with or without bronchiectasis, in addition to an ipsilateral pulmonary artery with diminished caliber. Ventilationperfusion scintigraphy scans may contribute to diagnosis. In our patient, a non-invasive and accessible test such as Doppler echocardiography revealed a decrease in pulmonary artery flow on the affected side, which correlated with the degree of pulmonary hypoperfusion observed in the ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. This finding suggests that Doppler echocardiography of the main pulmonary arteries could be a simple method to verify the degree of pulmonary hypoperfusion in SJS and other unilateral or asymmetric pulmonary disorders.

International guidelines recommend screening for OSA in all children with DS. The prevalence of respiratory conditions in Irish children with DS is unknown. The prevalence of Down Syndrome as estimated by Down Syndrome Ireland is 1 in 546 live births. This is significantly greater compared to the worldwide incidence as reported by the World Health Organization of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 1,100 live births worldwide Methods: A respiratory health questionnaire was distributed to all parents with children with DS in Ireland registered with Down Syndrome Ireland (DSI). Results: Three hundred and ninety three (393) surveys were returned. 27% of parents surveyed reported a diagnosis of OSA in their child. The diagnosis rate was very low compared with the high rate of report of OSA symptoms. Over 50% reported snoring, apneas and restlessness at night. In children who have not received a diagnosis of OSA, the median number of symptoms reported was 4 with older children having a higher burden of symptoms. High frequency of symptoms known to impact negatively on quality of life included daytime somnolence (47.0%) and new enuresis (20.0%)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF70": {"text": "This is the largest survey of its kind conducted internationally with parents of children with Down Syndrome reporting significant respiratory morbidity.

Objectives of management of patients with asthma include decreasing exposure to environmental triggers and decreasing the use of anti-inflammatory controller medications. The knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of parents of asthmatic children have a big influence on the quality of life of asthmatic children as these determine the care that they give. Objectives: This study investigated the asthma KAP of parents with asthmatic children who consulted at the outpatient department of a tertiary hospital. It determined if there was a difference in the asthma KAP of parents of children with controlled versus uncontrolled asthma and if there was a correlation between the asthma KAP of parents of asthmatic children and the number of emergency room (ER) consults and hospital admissions for asthma in the immediate past year.Results: A total of 66 subjects participated in the study. Partly and uncontrolled asthma was observed in 21.2% of the subjects' children. There was no difference in the asthma KAP of parents of children with controlled versus uncontrolled asthma. Among the subjects with children with frequent ER consults and hospital admissions, their asthma KAP scores were higher than those with no ER consults and hospital admissions, although these variables were not statistically significant.Conclusion: Parents of asthmatic children in a tertiary hospital had a good level of KAP on bronchial asthma comparable to those in other countries. The asthma KAP of parents with children whose asthma was controlled did not differ from those whose children had uncontrolled asthma. Frequent ER consults and hospital admissions may provide parents with opportunities to achieve higher asthma KAP scores.Chong-Silva DC., Pilato E., Filla T., Ros\u00e1rio NA Pediatric Department, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 \u2212 Curitiba, Brazil Introduction: Asthma is a chronic, frequent disease with high morbidity in childhood.

We report a late diagnosed congenital Case Presentation: A five-month-old girl infant was admitted to Hasan Sadikin General Hospital with respiratory distress, abdominal distention, hepatosplenomegaly, and poor feeding with failure of weight gain. She was referred by a private hospital in Bandung with disseminated TB and no improvement after 4 months of standard TB treatment. Her mother had died 1.5 months postpartum because of meningitis TB and low CD4 count, but negative HIV status. Tuberculosis and HIV screening of all family member results were negative.The baby was normal until she exhibited fever and abdominal distention at 1 month after birth. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and hospitalized for 13 days without any improvement, leading her father to bring her to other hospital. In this hospital, she was diagnosed with pulmonary TB, and treated with antituberculosis drug. Furthermore, she was hospitalized several times because of pneumonia, recurrent pleural effusion, and also miliary TB with Antituberculosis Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity (ADIH). She also had low CD4 but negative HIV status, anemia, thrombocytopenia,hypoalbuminemia, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. MRI and chestabdominal CT scanning showed bilateral pulmonary TB, pleural effusion, multiple lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with multiple nodules with central necrotic areas, adrenal TB, and spondylitis TB. The Xpert MTB/RIF results in both induced sputum and feces specimen were Mycobacterium tuberculosis detected with Rifampicin resistance, although the AFB smear result was negative. In day 4 after admission, respiratory distress worsened accompanied with decreased hemoglobin level and sepsis, thus blood culture-based antibiotic and PRC transfusion were given. Sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL) found by audiometry screening resulted in capreomycin being chosen as injection drug combined with levofloxacin, ethionamide, cycloserine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for the MDR TB regimen. After 30 days of MDR TB treatment, respiratory distress decreased, hepatomegaly was smaller, and bodyweight increased. She was finally discharged after being hospitalized for 2 months, and the MDR regimen was continued. Conclusion: TB screening in pregnancy and infants born from mothers with suspected TB is very important. MDR TB should be suspected in an infant with unresponsive pneumonia and standard TB treatment who are born from a mother deceased due TB. Late diagnosis, disseminated TB and MDR resulted in poor prognosis in this congenital TB case.

They were treated according to the airway clearance technique, which was prescribed by the treating physician. One group of children received hypertonic saline nebulizations followed by inhaled bronchodilators prior to chest physiotherapy and the other group received only inhaled bronchodilators prior to chest physiotherapy. The technique used to deliver bronchodilators was a metered dose inhaler with spacer device in both groups. Use of a home nebulizer was taught to parents in order to deliver the saline. An adequate training on chest physiotherapy was given to the parents in two sessions by a physiotherapist. A physiotherapy session of 20-30 min was recommended and 2 sessions were performed each day. The number of exacerbations during the 2month period was documented and spirometric assessment was done at the completion of the two months of therapy.Data were processed with Microsoft Excel; independent t test andMann-Whitney U test were used to examine the statistical significance. Statistical significance was established as p value less than 0.05.Descriptive statistics are presented as mean \u00b1 SD)Results: A total of 27 children were evaluated in the study. Fifteen children received hypertonic saline nebulizations prior to the use of bronchodilator and chest physiotherapy while 12 were given bronchodilators and chest physiotherapy only. The demographic and baseline measurements were comparable between the two groups.The most common etiology was suggested to be post infective bronchiectasis in 18 children. The mean improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was significantly higher (p = 0.002) in the hypertonic saline nebulized group (11.3 \u00b1 2.7) than in the non saline group \u2212(3.5 \u00b1 8.9). The hypertonic saline group showed a statistically significantly higher mean improvement in predicted FVC in saline group than in the conventional group, however FEV1/FVC ratio was comparable. The number of exacerbations was significantly lower in the saline nebulized group 0.3(0.51) compared to the non saline group Conclusion: Hypertonic saline nebulization prior to use of bronchodilators and chest physiotherapy is an effective strategy to improve quality of the airway clearance technique. Hypertonic saline nebulization improves dynamic lung volume including FEV1 and FVC. A significant improvement in PEFR and MEF75-25 is seen with the use of hypertonic saline premedication of chest physiotherapy. Hypertonic saline nebulization also reduces the rate of exacerbation.Recommendation: A randomized control trial with larger numbers is needed to test the effectiveness of use of hypertonic saline nebulization before chest physiotherapy Key Words: Non-CF Bronchiectasis, Hypertonic Saline, FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio, PEFR, MEF 25-75) M82 \u2212 The Molecular Epidemiological Characteristics of Subtype A Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Eastern China from 2009 to 2014. Dong L., Li HY., Dong YW., Dai LH., Fan JM., Chen XF. of Pediatric Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University \u2212 Wenzhou, China Objective: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subtypes and genotypes in Eastern China from 2009 to 2014, and to explore the genetic variability of the attachment (G) protein gene among subtype A RSV strains. Method: Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) from children under 5 years of age who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in three tertiary hospitals during 5 consecutive seasons from July, 2009 to June, 2014 were collected. RSV antigen was determined using direct immunofluorescence. 200 samples with RSV antigen positive were randomly selected from each epidemic season. RNA was extracted and identified as subtype A or B by using RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and randomly selected subtype A strains of the nearly full-length attachment (G) protein were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Result A total of 25,449 specimens were collected from patients during 5 consecutive epidemic periods, and 6416 (25.21%) were positive for RSV. Among 1000 randomly selected samples, 462 (46.2%) and 538(53.8%) samples were identified as RSV subtype A and B, respectively. Subgroup A types were predominant during two epidemic seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012). 52 strains of complete sequences of G genes were obtained, including four group A genotypes NA1, NA4, GA2 and ON1. NA1 genotype was the most (39/52,75%) common one, and was the predominant form in the first four popular seasons, followed by ON1 genotype (10/52,19%), which were first verified in December 2011, and totally 9 strains in 2013/ 2014. ON1 genotype was the only genotype of subtype A during the season of 2013/2014. There were some different variations in the second hypervariable region at the carboxyl-terminal of the G gene.The rates of homology between prototype strain A2 and the 52 strains of subtype A RSV were 80.7% to 89.3% at the nucleotide level and 74.4% to 82.6% at the amino acid level. On comparison of strains among the sequenced subtype A RSV, the rates of homology were 81.5% to 100% at the nucleotide level and 80.2% to 100% at the amino acid level. G protein variants included substitution, insertion and repeat, and the N-glycosylation sites mutation was obvious. There were several variations in the 24amino acid sequence that inserted into the ON1 genotype.Conclusions: NA1 is the predominant genotypes of subtype A RSV during 4 consecutive epidemic seasons from 2009 to 2013 in Eastern China. The variation in the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of G protein is obvious. There were various transmission chains of RSV caused by different genotypes during the 5 consecutive seasons. M93 \u2212 Rupture of a Massive Pulmonary Hydatid Cyst in an 8-Year-old Girl. A Case Report Babaei H. 1 , Kavandi S. 2 , Pediatrics Ward, Mousavi Teaching Hospital, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences \u2212 Zanjan, Iran; 2 Faculty of Humanity, University of Zanjan \u2212 Zanjan, Iran Morbidity by Hydatid cyst in children is not uncommon in some portions of world still. Our country (as has been reported in Lancet 2003; 362: 1295-1304, Echinococcosis) is located in a hyper endemic area. In alveolar hydatidosis, if surgical removal is unsuccessful, the mortality rate after 10 years is more than 90%. presentation: An 8-year-old girl referred to our hospital with productive cough and intermittent decrease of consciousness level on September 17 2017. Mild tachypnea was the only positive finding on first physical examination. A chest X-ray was ordered that showed surprisingly, right side massive pleural effusion and concurrent pneumothorax which shifted the mediastina to the opposite side. A consultation with the surgery department was performed for the patient, and additional clinical imaging showed bronchiectasis in upper lobe of the right lung. Water Lily-specific signs in thoracic-abdominal CT made our preliminary initial diagnosis as Echinococcus of the lung.After ultimately starting Albendazole 15 mg/kg treatment, surgery was performed in an equipped hospital. After right posterolateral thoracotomy, lung empyema from a ruptured hydatid cyst, pleural adhesion and inter-thoracic fibrin was reported and finally wide decortication was performed. The patient was discharged after 6 days post-operation hospitalization with good condition and administration of Albendazole continued and parents advised for referral to pediatrics infectious disease clinic for serial observations. She had good performance in school and was well on November 10 as of our last recall date. Rupture may occur during therapy or percutaneous aspiration and trauma can lead to severe complications, such as massive hemoptysis and tension pneumothorax, lung abscess and asphyxia. 8%) were placed on HFNC. The average age was 60 days (11-180 days). A history of prematurity was found in 22.5% of cases, hypotrophy in 10% of cases, neonatal mechanical ventilation in 10% of cases and congenital heart disease in 3% of cases. Viral contagion was found in 70% of cases. In all cases, HFNC was used in the first 72 hours of hospitalization, and in the first 24 hours in 38% of cases. The average duration of HFNC was 2.62 days (1-17 days). The mean total hospital stay was 6.3 days in the HFNC group versus 9.8 days in the other group, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.028). A transfer to the intensive care unit was indicated in 13/35 of the cases (37%) in the group using HFNC versus 19/45 cases (42.2%) in the second group.Conclusion: HFNC appears to be really effective in severe bronchiolitis, with a decrease in the use of invasive ventilation, especially in children under 3 months of age. HFNC is available in a general pediatric ward and is easy to use, improving the prognosis of patients and reducing pressure on the pediatric intensive care unit.M125 \u2212 Vitamin D Supplementation and Tuberculin Skin Test Conversion among Healthy Under-Five Children with Tuberculosis Contact.

Vitamin D is known to affect innate and adaptive immunity, inhibit bacterial invasion, therefore will protect from developing TB infection indicated by TST conversion. Objective: To evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation among healthy under-five children with tuberculosis contact to develop TST conversion. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in 66 under-five children who had tuberculosis contact, but whose tuberculin skin tests (TST) were negative (healthy). We administered a high single dose of vitamin D3 supplementation twice, at an interval of 6 weeks. After 12 weeks, we performed a 2nd TST, with positive TST (diameter>10 mm) indicating TST conversion. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee from Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Andalas. Results: There were no difference in TST conversion between intervention (12.9%) and placebo groups (11.4%) with a p value = 0.855. Baseline characteristics showed mean levels of vitamin D <30 ng / ml, vitamin D supplementation significantly increased vitamin D level in the intervention groups (24.32 \u00b1 7.50 vs. Conclusion: There were no differences in TST conversion between intervention and placebo groups after vitamin D supplementation twice over 12 weeks among under-five healthy children with TB contacts, although increased vitamin D serum levels. M158 \u2212 Study of Bacterial Agents of Pneumoniae in Children and Detection of Antibiogram Patterns in Hamadan, West of Iran. Medical Microbiology, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences Faculty of Medicine \u2212 Hamadan, Iran Background and aims: Bacterial pneumoniae is still one of the most dangerous infectious diseases and causes serious complications and mortalities in children. The aim of the present study was to identify the most common bacterial agents causing pneumoniae in children less than 12 years old and detection of their resistance to current antibiotics in Hamadan. Methods: Overall, 542 children suspected of pneumoniae were investigated for results of pleural fluid cultures and antibiogram patterns. Frequency of age, sex and seasons of patients were also studied from 1999 to 2003. The data were gathered through a questionnaire and analyzed using Epi6 system. The species were identified by biochemical and serological methods. Antibiogram tests were also performed using the Kirby-Bauer method. Results: Out of 542 children suspected of pneumoniae, 72 cases (13.2%) had positive bacterial culture of which 54.4% were gramnegative and 43.6% were also gram-positive bacteria. The most common species were: Staphylococcus aureus 18.6%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 16.9%, Klebsiella ozaenae 12.3%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 11.8%, Haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, Bacteroides species 7.8%, Streptococcus \u00df-haemolyticus 6.1%, E. coli 4.9%, Neisseria meningitidis 4.5%, Acinetobacter species 3.2% and other gram-negative bacteria 23.3%. The most positive cultures were observed in children 1-4 year age group (31.3%), male (52.4%) and during winter (41.8%). The results of antibiograms showed that the most effective antibiotics were cefixime, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, ciprofloxacin for both gram positive-and gram-negative bacteria, but they showed high resistance to tetracycline, amoxicillin and ampicillin. Conclusions: The present study showed that some gram-positive bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are predominant causes of bacterial pneumoniae in children less than 12 years old in these regions. Most species showed high resistance to routine antibiotics such as tetracycline, amoxicillin and ampicillin. M166 \u2212 The Correspondence of Client Statistics Referred to our Clinic with the Rate of Airborne Particle Pollution. city is located in the country of Iran, in the Middle East continent (or region). DMS latitude longitude coordinates for Zanj\u0101n are: 36\u00b040'24.96\"N, 48\u00b028'43.32\"E. Zanjan (48\u00b028' longitude and 36\u00b04 0' latitude) (Figure 1). In recent few years, our country's climate was threatened by four main Dust Particle Focuses through our Western neighbors of which the most significant (23 cases of forty airborne particle flows in last years) was the North-West of Iraq and the East of Syria Countries. As our recorded documents in environmental organization shows, these known hotspots have been activated around March to September annually in past years and we had school closures and work shut downs for a few days in 2017. As we know, airborne particles not only can play an important role in dysfunction of the pulmonary system but can also trigger an attack in known cases of asthmatic children. In the present study, we will try to show the relationship between the number of patients referred to the Zanjan solitary pediatrics asthma and allergy clinic and the rate of airborne particles that was recorded by the Department of Environment in Zanjan branch. Airborne particles are divided into two classifications: coarse, or those particles larger than 2.5 microns in diameter, and fine, those particles 2.5 microns or less in diameter. Air monitoring in Zanjan is conducted by a local environmental organization which provides air pollution data regarding ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) as has been recommended in Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 6 monitoring stations in the city center and around the area, mainly in urban areas. We have collected only the data of the city center station. Client statistics in our clinic correspond to the rate of airborne particle pollution that is recorded in the city center station. The negative effects of air pollutants on pulmonary function place children at a greater risk of air pollutant-induced exacerbation of asthma for the duration of their lives. All studies reviewed indicate that outdoor air pollution affects the appearance and exacerbation of asthma in children. (J Asthma. 2011 Jun; 48(5):470-81. doi: 10.3109/02770903.2011.570407. Epub 2011 Apr 13. Outdoor air pollution and asthma in children. Tzivian L.). According to \"AQI\", when air pollution is even in moderate range, children with asthma should limit their time outdoors; especially from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Most of all, do not exercise outdoors. In such conditions, we recommend that, because of its morbidity, despite schools being open, students with a history of asthma should be exempted from school. \"AQI\" in Zanjan City Center Station Day/Month: M179 \u2212 Performance of Interferon Gamma Release Assay and Tuberculin Skin Test for TB Diagnosis in HIV Infected Children. Kaswandani N., Nurul D. , University of Indonesia \u2212 Jakarta, Indonesia Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is an important opportunistic infection in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in high burden TB countries. Diagnosis of TB in immunocompromised children is difficult, such that the tuberculin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay [IGRA, QuantiFERON \u00ae -TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT)] are expected to be accurate for diagnosis of TB infection in HIV infected children. Reports on QFT-GIT accuracy in children with HIV infection still vary. Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of QFT-GIT and TST to diagnose TB in HIV infected children. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 48 HIV infected children with suspected TB aged 1 month to 15 years old. Data which included history taking, physical examination, thorax radiology, TST, QFT-GIT, and bacteriological examination (Xpert MTB/RIF and MGIT culture) were collected. Result: The prevalence of TB in HIV-infected children is 20.9% (confirmed TB 4.2% and clinical TB 18.7%). The clinical symptoms of HIV-infected children with TB are: chronic cough (90%), body weight decrement (80%), reduction of activity (80%), lymph node enlargement (60%), and prolonged fever (50%). The sensitivity of QFT-GIT towards clinical TB in HIV-infected children is 38% (CI 95%: 12-77%), specificity 100% (CI 95%: 98-100), PPV 100% (CI 95%: 98-100), and NPV 88% (CI 95%: 76-94). The sensitivity of tuberculin test towards clinical TB is 29% (CI 95%: 8-64%), specificity 97% (CI 95%: 87-100), PPV 67% (CI 95%: 21-94), and NPV 88% (CI 95%: 76-95%).The sensitivity of QFT-GIT towards bacteriological examination is 50% (CI 95%: 9-91%), specificity 96% (CI 95%: 85-99%), PPV 33% (CI 95%: 6-79%), and NPV 98% (CI 95%: 88-100%). Accuration towards bacteriological examination and tuberculin test could not be evaluated.Conclusion: Both QFT and TST showed high specificity but low sensitivity to diagnose TB. The accuracy of QFT-GIT to detect TB in HIV infected children is slightly superior than TST. Therefore, these two methods could be a choice depending on its availability and patient comfort.M182 \u2212 Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis in Children: Etiology, Clinical Profile and Outcome in a Resource-Poor Setting \u2212 A Single Unit Experience. W.D.A Anuradha K. 1 , K.G Gunathilaka P. 1 , P Wickramasinghe V. 2 Pediatrics, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children \u2212 Colombo, Sri Lanka; 2 Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo \u2212 Colombo, Sri Lanka Introduction: Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is commoner than CF bronchiectasis in both developing and developed countries with a significant contribution to chronic respiratory morbidity. However, only very limited scientific data are available on its clinical profile and management. Bronchiectasis in children without CF is said to be the end result of repeated episodes of insults to the respiratory system due to several etiologies leading to permanent bronchial tree injury and dilatation. The clinical case definition of bronchiectasis is imprecise and its severity and extent is highly variable, ranging from minimum respiratory morbidity to death. Symptoms are nonspecific and chest radiographs are relatively insensitive in the diagnosis. Therefore, high degree of suspicion is needed when evaluating children with recurrent respiratory tract infections or signs suggestive of chronic respiratory insufficiency. Children who are suspected to have bronchiectasis should undergo a high-resolution computer tomographic (HRCT) scan without delay to confirm the diagnosis, to define the distribution and severity of airway involvement. Lung function tests in older children provide a measure of functional impairment and small-airway involvement. Management approach of non-CF bronchiectasis follows a similar approach to the management of CF bronchiectasis as there are no specific guidelines. Reviewing the children with non-CF bronchiectasis was done with the aim of contributing to fill the gaps in the understanding of their clinical profile and outcome. Objective: To describe the clinical profile, etiology, specific management and outcome in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis attending a tertiary care hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Methods: Twenty-seven children with an HRCT scan-based diagnosis of bronchiectasis, presenting to the Professorial Pediatric Unit, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo during the period of September 2016 to December 2017, were selected for the review. Absence of typical clinical features and having two negative sweat tests performed at a minimum of 6 months apart were taken to exclude cystic fibrosis. A detailed chart review of children diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis was done. Results: The majority of the patients with non-CF bronchiectasis were females 18 (66%) and the mean age of the study sample was 7.4 years (SD =3.24). The mean age at the diagnosis of bronchiectasis was 5.2 years (SD = 2.50) and the indication to perform an HRCT in the majority (19 children) was the combination of recurrent respiratory tract infections with persistent crepitations on examination. Mean duration of symptoms /medical concerns prior to the diagnosis/HRCT was 3.8 years (SD = 1.54). Bilateral involvement was seen in 9 (33%) patients. Only 6 (22%) patients were referred to the center by a pediatrician or a general practitioner with the suspicion of bronchiectasis and the rest (21) were diagnosed when admitted with an exacerbation, with the background of recurrent respiratory tract infections. Twelve (44%) children showed a weight for height or a BMI centile for age less than \u22122SD. Mean number of episodes of exacerbations per year was 6. Spirometry was done in 22 patients at the analysis of the clinical profile. Best FEV1/FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second/Forced Vital Capacity) ratio was >80% in 16 (72%) and <80 % only in 6 (28%). FVC was not reduced with a predicted value >80% in the majority (12 patients, 44%). FVC was < 60-80% in 7 patients and < 60 % in 3 patients who were on home oxygen therapy. Predicted FEV1 was more than 80% in 14 (63 %) and less than 80% in 8 children. Analysis of etiology revealed one patient each with common variable immune deficiency (14 years), with a past history of tuberculosis (15 years), intralobar sequestration (13 years) and late diagnosis of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (3 years). The commonest etiology was post infectious where 14 (51%) had one or more episodes of severe pneumonia needing respiratory support during infancy with other common etiologies being excluded. Nine Primary Cilliary Dyskinesia (PCD) were not available but there were no patients with a typical clinical profile of PCD. Satisfactory postural drainage was followed by 15 (55%) and the rest had deficiencies in the technique. Pneumococcal vaccination was given for 24 patients (85%) outside of the Expanded Program of Immunization. Only 20 (74%) patients had complied with regular follow-up. Three patients had undergone lobectomy. Out of the sample, 3 children are on home oxygen therapy and were dependent on parents for activities of daily living. Conclusion: The commonest cause of non-CF bronchiectasis in the above group is post infection. There is a significant delay in the diagnosis despite children being symptomatic. A high degree of suspicion is needed for the early diagnosis especially in children with a history of severe respiratory infections in early childhood. There is a need to create awareness about the importance of early diagnosis of bronchiectasis and the importance of correct postural drainage techniques and follow-up as it would lead to less complications and better prognosis.14. MISCELLANEOUS N13 \u2212 Pleuropulmonary Blastoma in Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation: Challenging Diagnosis of an Asymptomatic Child Stachewski Verrone K. 1 , Souza Nascimento J. 2 , Pereira de Oliveira Junior E. 3Introduction: Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is an abnormality of lung development and cannot be distinguished radiologically or clinically from rare primary tumors such as Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB). We report a rare case of CPAM and PPB overlap in a 2-year-old absolutely asymptomatic girl with a huge cystic lesion.Case Presentation: A 2-year-old girl was referred to our hospital for a giant cystic pulmonary lesion with a large and solid mass. This lesion had undergone a huge increase in 18 months since it was first discovered by a pediatrician during a random chest X-ray performed because of a flu. The initial clinical examination revealed a very good condition. The pulmonary auscultation was absolutely normal despite the dramatic appearance of the radiological findings. There were no reported anomalies on the antenatal ultrasound or neonatal complications. Good birth weight (w: 3000g; h: 49 cm) and development. She", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF18": {"text": "Discussion: Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM), formerly known as Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM) consists in multicystic masses of segmental lung tissue with abnormal bronchial proliferation. It accounts for approximately 95% of all congenital cystic lung diseases and 10% of pediatric lung cancers have a history of CPAM. There are five subtypes classified mainly according to cystic size: Type I: large cysts, Type II: cysts less than 2 cm in diameter.Type III: microcysts that involve an entire lobe, Type IV: unlined cysts that typically affect a single lobe that it is indistinguishable from Type I on imaging and Type 0: very rare and lethal postnatally.PPB is a very rare intrathoracic malignant neoplasm that originates during lung development and can arise from the lung, pleura or both. ItABSTRACT was described by Manivel et al. in 1988 and was later subdivided into three types on the basis of the morphological pattern: Type I: multilocular cysts containing primitive small mesenchymal cells within the cyst wall, Type II: cystic and solid components (mixed) and Type III: exclusively solid tumors, in order of increasing and malignancy. Priest et al. in 1996 reported that type I is most observed in patients in the first years of life compared to type II and III that are found in older patients \u2212 between 3 and 4 years of age. Type 1 is different from the rest because of its subtle malignant changes and good prognosis. The clinical presentation may be asymptomatic or have secondary symptoms due to the expansion or infection of the cyst, infection sometimes being recurrent. The most frequent findings on chest X-ray are: cystic lesions, hyperinflation, mediastinal shift and pneumothorax. Usually there is no adjacent rib erosion or calcification. CT scan remains the most sensitive technique including the largest cyst size, the nature of the cyst (septated or containing solid components) and the presence of a systemic vascular supply. The incidence of PPB among apparently benign lesions is 4%. Several studies have suggested that these two entities can be indistinguishable.The precise relationship between CPAM and malignancy, especially Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) remains unknown. Some studies indicate that the PPB etiology may originate from previously existing CPAM in the lung \u2212 about 31% \u2212 but nothing has been proven to date. There are cases that correlate these two pathologies, because they present very similar histological types. Generally the diagnosis is", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF19": {"text": ": A total of 307 questionnaires out of 721 given out were completed (response rate 42.6%). 115 children (37.5%) felt sleepy during the day for at least 2 days per week, with 52 children (17%) falling asleep while watching television at least 2 days per week. 177 children (57.7%) slept less than the recommended 9 hours on a school day. On a non-school day, 58 children (18.9%) got less than 9 hours sleep. 106 children (34.6%) of children did not have a regular bedtime routine at least 5 nights a week. The most popular activity in the hour before bedtime was watching television; 229 children (74.6%) regularly engaged in watching television at night. 143 children (46.6%) used smartphones for games in the hour before bedtime. 52 children (6.9%) used computers to watch videos during the hour before bedtime. Despite this, 273 of 307 parents surveyed (88.9%) felt that their child did not have a sleep problem. Amongst parents, the most popular activity in the hour before bedtime was watching television (218 parents, 71.0%). 159 parents (51.8%) use smartphones for social media in the hour before bedtime.Conclusion: Daytime sleepiness was present in a third of children. Most children surveyed were not getting the recommended duration of sleep. Some lacked regular bedtime routine and most used televisions and smartphones before bedtime (which is known to negatively affect sleep quality). However, most parents did not think their child had a sleep problem. Parental role-modeling is challenging due to parents' own suboptimal sleep habits including a high rate of digital device use amongst themselves. Parental education is needed to ensure their children get the right quality and quantity of sleep.
