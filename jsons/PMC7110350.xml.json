            "text": "The causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis, expresses three major extracellular toxin protein components, encoded on its large pXO1 plasmid (Okinaka et al., 1999). Protective antigen (PA) combines with either lethal factor (LF) or edema factor (EF) to form a functional binary toxin (reviewed in Abrami et al., 2005). PA binds to one of two cellular receptors, TEM8 (Bradley et al., 2001; Liu and Leppla, 2003) or CMG2 (Scobie et al., 2003). Upon receptor binding, the 83 kDa PA (PA83) is cleaved at a specific sequence by furin or a furin-like protease, releasing a 20 kDa N-terminal fragment (PA20) while leaving a 63 kDa C-terminal fragment (PA63) bound to the receptor (Singh et al., 1989; Molloy et al., 1992). An LF binding site on PA63 is simultaneously exposed via this cleavage event (Novak et al., 1992). Spontaneous heptamerization of the PA:receptor complex occurs (Milne et al., 1994), allowing competitive, high-affinity binding by EF or LF (Cunningham et al., 2002; Mogridge et al., 2002), followed by internalization of the toxin:receptor complex via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Abrami et al., 2003). Acidification of the endosome produces structural rearrangements in the PA prepore heptamer, leading to pore formation and membrane insertion (Lacy et al., 2004; Santelli et al., 2004), and subsequent release of LF and/or EF into the cytosol (reviewed in Abrami et al., 2005).",

Several recent model studies demonstrate that a strong humoral response to PA contributes to a protective immune response to anthrax (Miller et al., 1998; Pitt et al., 2001; Reuveny et al., 2001; Little et al., 2004), and several regions that serve as targets for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been identified (Little et al., 1996; Brossier et al., 2004). The mature 735-amino-acid PA protein (GenBank accession number AAT98414) contains four distinct functional domains (Petosa et al., 1997). Domain 1 (residues 1\u2013258) functions in oligomerization of PA and binding to LF and EF (Chauhan & Bhatnagar, 2002; Cunningham et al., 2002; Lacy et al., 2004), and contains the sequence 164RKKR167, which serves as the furin cleavage site (Singh et al., 1989; Molloy et al., 1992). Domain 2 (residues 259\u2013487) functions in pore formation, heptamerization, membrane insertion, and translocation of EF and LF (Singh et al., 1994; Benson et al., 1998; Miller et al., 1999). Domain 3 (residues 488\u2013595) functions in oligomerization (Mogridge et al., 2001), while domain 4 (residues 596\u2013735) functions in binding the cellular receptor (Singh et al., 1991; Varughese et al., 1999; Santelli et al., 2004).",

Other mAbs target epitopes in regions spanning the interfaces between domains 1 and 2 and domains 3 and 4, and prevent LF from interacting with PA at the cell surface (Little et al., 1996), or target epitopes in domain 2, preventing cleavage of PA83 to PA63 (Brossier et al., 2004).

Subcutaneous boosters of 5 \u00b5g of rPA in PBS mixed with an equal portion of Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (Difco) were given on days 30, 48 and 63. The mice were given a final intraperitoneal boost of 3 \u00b5g of rPA in PBS and sacrificed 3 days later. The rPA-specific humoral immune response was monitored via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using sera collected from the mice during the inoculation protocol, as described in Berry (2004), except the 96-well ELISA plates (MaxiSorp\u2122, Nalge-NUNC, Rochester, NY) were coated with either rPA or, as a negative control, bovine serum albumin (BSA), both at 100 ng per well. Once sufficient anti-rPA titers were detected (OD405nm in ELISA at least three-fold above background), the mice were sacrificed, and hybridoma production and growth proceeded as described (Berry et al., 2004). mAb harvesting, concentration and isotyping were performed as described previously (Berry et al., 2004). Hybridoma supernatants were screened via the same ELISA to identify clones expressing high titers (OD405 in ELISA equal to or greater than that observed in the mouse immune serum) of rPA-specific mAbs. Mouse immune and preimmune sera (diluted 1 : 2000 with 0.2% BSA in PBS) served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The mAbs were purified using HiTrap\u2122 Protein G HP columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), the buffer was exchanged with PBS and the mAb concentrations were determined with a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL).",

Briefly, the mouse macrophage adherent cell line J774A.1 was seeded at 105 cells per mL into the wells of a 96-well culture plate (96 Well Clear Flat Bottom Polystyrene TC-Treated Microplate, Corning, NY), and grown overnight in BD Cell\u2122 mAb Medium, Quantum Yield (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) supplemented with 10% standard fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1%l-glutamine, and 1 \u00d7 antibiotic\u2013antimycotic solution (Wisent, St Bruno, QC, Canada) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After overnight incubation the culture supernatant was removed from each well in the 96-well culture plate. In a separate 96-well ELISA plate, 100 \u00b5L aliquots of hybridoma supernatants (undiluted) or mAbs (diluted 1 : 10 to 1 : 100 000 in PBS) were added to appropriate wells. Into each test well containing diluted mAbs, 100 \u00b5L of a mixture of 2.0 \u00b5g mL\u22121 rPA and 1.0 \u00b5g mL\u22121 rLF (produced as described in Kassam et al., 2005), diluted in PBS, was added. Cell control wells contained PBS only, and did not receive any toxin or mAb, and toxin control wells contained toxin but no mAbs. This ELISA plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Aliquots (100 \u00b5L) of each dilution of each mAb containing toxin (or appropriate toxin or cell control) was then transferred from the ELISA plate into the wells of the 96-well culture plate containing the adherent J774A.1 cells.

The cells were incubated for a further 2\u20132.5 h at 37\u00b0C to allow for color development, and the plate scanned in an ELISA plate reader at 490 nm. In a second assay, appropriately diluted rPA was added to the J774A.1 cells in the absence of any mAb, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The mAbs were separately combined with rLF and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then applied to the cells to which the PA was already added. All component concentrations, dilutions, incubations and other relevant conditions in this second assay format were as outlined above. The lowest mAb dilution that resulted in an OD490 nm reading equal to 90% or greater of the no-toxin control was used to determine the neutralizing titer. All neutralization assays were performed at least in triplicate.",

After assaying all of the clones via an initial in vitro LeTx neutralization assay, three hybridoma clones, F20G75, F20G76 and F20G77, were chosen for further study. Sequencing of the expressed VH and VL region cDNAs indicates that these were distinct hybridomas formed by the immortalization of B cells with uniquely rearranged V genes (C. R. Corbett et al., unpublished data). To determine the nature of the rPA epitopes recognized by the anti-rPA mAbs, Western immunoblots were performed in duplicate; a representative immunoblot is shown in Fig. 1. All of the mAbs recognized an approximately 83 kDa protein that corresponds to mature rPA, and showed no cross-reactivity with either rLF or BSA. Binding to denatured protein suggests that these mAbs recognize a linear epitope (Cohen et al., 1986). The endpoint ELISA titer of the neutralizing mAbs specific for rPA (coated at 100 ng per well) was defined by the lowest mAb dilution resulting in a fivefold higher OD reading than the background reading obtained against BSA (Table 1). Specificity was good, with no significant reaction to rLF or BSA. Measurement of the affinity of the mAbs for rPA was performed via surface plasmon resonance analysis. As shown in Table 1, the KD for each mAb binding to rPA was in the nanomolar range.

            "text": "To identify the rPA epitopes recognized by the mAbs, overlapping pin-peptides covering the entire sequence of PA were employed for epitope mapping. Each mAb reacted strongly to the same set of three overlapping 15-mers (Fig. 2), extending from S301 to S325. The core motif common to all three 15-mer peptides is 311ASFFD315. In the crystal structure of mature PA alone (Petosa et al., 1997), and in complex with receptor CMG2 (Santelli et al., 2004), the region of the 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop extending from H304 to S319, encompassing most of the above noted epitopes of the F20G75/76/77 mAbs, remains unresolved owing to its flexibility. Within the PA63 heptamer, this region undergoes structural rearrangements in the acidified endosome, leading to the production of a predicted extended \u03b2-barrel that spans the endosomal membrane (Petosa et al., 1997; Benson et al., 1998; Nassi et al., 2002; Santelli et al., 2004). Indeed, specific residues in the region extending from V303 to D315 (Qa'dan et al., 2005), including F313 and F314 (Singh et al., 1994; Benson et al., 1998), are involved in LF translocation, supporting the model that the 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop is involved in \u03b2-barrel formation. The 313FFD315 site in PA domain 2 is sensitive to chymotrypsin cleavage (Novak et al., 1992; Singh et al., 1994), suggesting that a portion of the flexible 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop containing these residues is solvent-exposed in the PA monomer (Singh et al., 1994). rPA was subjected to digestion by trypsin and chymotrypsin, and mAb binding to the proteolytic fragments was assayed using Western immunoblot. Trypsin cleaves PA at the 164RKKR167 sequence in domain 1, resulting in 63- and 20 kDa fragments (Novak et al., 1992), while chymotrypsin cleavage at the 313FFD315 sequence in domain 2 results in 47- and 37 kDa fragments (Singh et al., 1994). As shown in Fig. 3, trypsin cleavage had no effect on mAb recognition of the 63 kDa fragment of rPA, while chymotrypsin cleavage completely abrogated mAb binding, confirming that the epitope of all three mAbs extends across the 313FFD315 sequence in domain 2. This observation, coupled with the fact that three mAbs were developed that recognize the flexible 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop, lends support to the prediction that this region is exposed on the surface of PA.",

These peptides were assessed in the same manner as described for the epitope mapping employing overlapping peptides covering the whole PA sequence. As shown in Fig. 4, alteration of residues extending from A311 to D315 reduced mAb binding significantly, with F313A, F314A and D315A having the most apparent effect. The presence of two bulky, hydrophobic Phe residues in the middle of this epitope probably creates a specific peptide conformation that is critical for mAb recognition (Alvord et al., 1986; Warren et al., 1995). Interestingly, changing H310 to Ala increased apparent mAb binding efficiency by approximately twofold. The H310 residue in the epitope may constrain folding of the peptide via interaction with F314 or F315 (Yoshida et al., 2000), and, as opposed to the case of the F314A and F315A replacements, the H310A replacement might result in an alternate structural peptide conformation that leads to more efficient mAb binding.",

            "text": "\nIn vitro neutralization assays were employed to assay quantitatively the ability of the mAbs to neutralize LeTx. The neutralizing titers were determined by the lowest mAb concentration that resulted in an OD reading of at least 90\u2013100% of that of the cell control samples (containing no toxin). Two formats of the same assay were employed. In the first, mAbs were coincubated with rPA and rLF prior to addition of the LeTx to the cells, whereas in the second, rPA was allowed to bind to the J774A.1 cells prior to addition of mAbs and rLF. Using the first assay format, the mAbs all neutralized LeTx, exhibiting neutralizing titers of 12.5 ng mL\u22121 (F20G75), 11.8 ng mL\u22121 (F20G76) and 16.0 ng mL\u22121 (F20G77). Another mAb, raised against a nonanthrax protein antigen, served as a negative control, and exhibited no neutralization activity. Interestingly, neutralization did not appear to be dose-responsive (Laffly et al., 2005; Brossier et al., 2004). Rather, neutralization appeared to be an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 event, with the ability of each mAb to neutralize LeTx remaining high at concentrations of 12\u201316 ng mL\u22121, until a dramatic decrease occurred once the mAbs were diluted to a concentration approaching 5\u20137 ng mL\u22121. This might be due to a strictly defined \u2018threshold\u2019 concentration of mAb molecules required to bind the specific epitope in rPA and inhibit LeTx activity. Once this minimal threshold level of mAb molecules is present in the local environment where PA, LF and the toxin receptor are present, LeTx activity is completely abrogated, and the presence of more mAbs in the environment causes no increase in neutralization. Alternatively, the high affinity of the neutralizing mAbs for PA might affect the dose responsiveness of the observed in vitro LeTx neutralization. As noted previously, an affinity-enhanced PA-specific neutralizing mAb (KD for PA binding of 0.33 nM) exhibited a much steeper LeTx neutralization dose\u2013response curve compared with the parental mAb (KD for PA binding of 3.5\u20133.7 nM) from which it was derived (Mohamed et al., 2005). Similarly, a high-affinity (picomolar range) PA-specific neutralizing mAb lacking an Fc region exhibited a steep LeTx neutralization dose\u2013response curve, although a different cell line was employed in that study (Mabry et al., 2005). Nevertheless, these reports do suggest that higher affinity anti-PA mAbs (or scAbs) can result in characteristically steep LeTx in vitro neutralization dose responsiveness. Using the second assay format, in which rPA was allowed to incubate with the J774A.1 macrophage cells prior to the addition of mAbs and rLF, some neutralization of LeTx was evident. However, mAb concentrations approaching 1\u201310 \u00b5g mL\u22121 were required for significant levels of neutralization to occur, and in some cases the OD readings in the presence of the mAbs in this second assay format only approached, but did not exceed, a level of 90% compared with the no-toxin controls. This observation indicates that neutralization was considerably more effective when the mAbs were able to bind to rPA prior to addition of the LeTx to the cells, and suggests that these mAbs cannot efficiently bind directly to rPA on the cell surface. Thus, it is probable that the mAbs do not act by blocking LF binding to surface-bound PA. In support of this observation, the H304-S319 \u2018insertion loop\u2019, which contains the epitope recognized by mAbs F20G75/76/77, is essentially buried between neighboring monomers in the heptameric prepore (Lacy et al., 2004), which would probably restrict mAb access to the epitope.",

In one scenario, binding of the mAbs to the predicted surface-exposed epitope within the 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop of PA might result in regional conformational changes in PA that would prevent efficient receptor binding. An examination of the cocrystal structure of PA with CMG2 reveals that key interactions are made between the \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 loop of domain 2 and CMG2 (Santelli et al., 2004), and because the 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop is in close proximity to the \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 loop, binding of mAbs to the 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop might disrupt PA : receptor binding. Alternatively, binding of the mAbs to this region might create steric hindrance that either directly blocks access of PA to its receptor, or, more likely, prevents heptamerization after receptor binding. In this latter scenario, one can reason that mAb binding to the above noted epitope within the 2\u03b22\u20132\u03b23 loop region of PA could prevent the interaction of this domain with its nearest neighbor in the heptamer by creating a physical barrier to intersubunit binding. Regardless of which specific mechanism results in LeTx neutralization, it is clear from the data presented herein that these mAbs most likely neutralize LeTx at a step prior to the interaction of PA with its receptor and subsequent heptamer formation on the cell surface.",

Synthetic peptides on a solid support matrix were synthesized such that every residue extending from N306 to V320 was altered in turn to Ala (or Gly in the case where an Ala was already present in the epitope) and their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) F20G75, F20G76 and F20G77 were assessed using ELISA. The background OD405 value was determined from reactivity of the mAbs with unrelated peptide sequences present on the same pin-peptide block. The OD reading for mAb binding to the \u2018wild-type\u2019 peptide (no changes to any amino acid within the epitope) was considered the baseline maximum binding level, to which the OD readings for mAbs binding to the altered peptides were compared as an indication of binding efficiency [% maximum OD=(OD of altered peptide/OD of unaltered peptide) \u00d7 100]. The assay was performed twice for each mAb, and the average value of two experiments is shown.",
