One has generally evolved in viruses with large genomes with the potential to encode many proteins, including those required for viral DNA replication. A typical example of this strategy is found in the herpesviruses to block cell cycle progression, preventing entry into S -phase (1). The other strategy to impinge on cell cycle control is more typical of DNA viruses with small genomes. Here, virus-encoded proteins, which are not homologs of any known cellular protein, interfere directly with the normal function of cell cycle regulatory components to subvert their activity. Typical examples are the viral oncoproteins that sequester the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein as a first step in inducing S -phase entry by activating the expression of E2F-regulated genes; for example, adenoviruses (2). Disruption of the cell cycle to favor virus replication is not confined to DNA viruses. Retroviruses also disrupt the cell cycle.",

(5) demonstrated that extracellular added Vpr induced G2-phase arrest, and the authors suggested that free Vpr in the serum of HIV-infected patients may preprogram cells in order to facilitate replication of HIV in infected individuals. Consistent with the perturbation of the cell cycle observed in tissue culture-infected cells, lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals show high levels of cyclin B and also nucleolar proteins (whose expression is linked to the cell cycle) (6).",

For the negative-strand RNA viruses, there are several examples of cell cycle control. For instance, measles virus infection results in a G0 block (7), and the paramyxovirus simian virus V protein prolongs the cell cycle by delaying cells in G1 and G2 (8). In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) delays cell growth by inhibiting cytokinesis and also allows cells to accumulate in S/G2 (9,10). Several examples of different picornaviruses interacting with the cell cycle have been described. More recently Feuer et al. (11) have shown that cells arrested in G1 or G1/S produced higher levels of infectious coxsackievirus and viral polyproteins compared with cells in the G0 phase, or cells blocked at the G2/M boundary. Feuer et al. (11) suggested that persistence of coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) in vivo might be dependent on infection of G0 cells, which do not support replication. If such cells were to reenter the cell cycle, then the virus may reactivate and trigger chronic viral or immune-mediated pathology in the host. Such findings suggest that locally",

In the former case, swirl the flask and return to the incubator for 3-5 min until most cells have detached.Check that cells are detached using phase contrast microscopy. If cells remain attached to the plasticware, either bang the flask again or increase the trypsin/EDTA incubation period.Once most of the cells are detached, add a volume of culture media at incubator temperature and pipet up and down so that a single-cell suspension is generated. This suspension can now be placed into Falcon tubes for further steps.To wash the cell suspension, spin samples using a swingout rotor at 220g relative centrifugal force (RCF; e.g., rotor A-4-62 Eppendorf, 220g RCF, 1046 rpm), remove supernatant so that a cell pellet remains, and add a volume of 4\u00b0C PBS. Carry out this process a further two times before resuspending cells in HEPES (see\nSubheading 2.3., item 4 and see\nNote 13).Transfer the cell suspension to a precooled tissue homogenizer and homogenize 10 times using a tight-fitting pestle (0.0010-0.0030-inch clearance), while keeping the homogenizer on ice. The number of strokes needed depends on the cell type used, so it is necessary to examine the homogenized cells with a phase contrast microscope after every 10 strokes. Stop when>90% of the cells have burst, leaving intact nuclei.To obtain a pellet containing enriched nuclei, centrifuge the homogenized cells again at 220g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C.Resuspend the pellet with a volume S1 solution by pipeting up and down. In another tube containing a volume of S2, layer onto the top the resuspended pellet; ensure that the two layers remain cleanly separated.Centrifuge this cushion at 1430g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain a purer nuclear pellet. Following this spin, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in a volume of S2 solution by pipeting up and down.Appropriate sonication on ice is a crucial stage in the preparation of nucleoli (see\nNote 14).To prepare a nucleolar concentrated pellet, layer the sonicated material over a volume of S3 solution and centrifuge at 3000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C.Further purification of nucleoli can be carried out by re-suspending the pellet with S2 solution, and centrifuging at 1430g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting pellet contains highly purified nucleoli, which can be examined by microscopy and, if required, stored at 80\u00b0C.\n",

It is good practice to run two sets of strips per sample, one to be stained following the IEF phase, and the other to be used for the 2D and subsequent analysis.Using a suitable tray, place sufficient sample volume into each well so that each IPG strip is in contact with the solution through its entire length. Lay the IPG strip gel side down into the sample buffer. Ensure that all samples are evenly in contact with the strip since it will not be absorbed through the plastic backing. It is recommended that for strips of 11 cm, 185 (\u03bc,L of sample be used per strip (approx 250 (\u03bc,g per strip). When preparing samples, do not place the vials on ice, as the urea will crystallize out of the solution.Leave these strips for 1 hr, then overlay each of the strips with 2-3 mL of mineral oil to prevent evaporation during the strip rehydration process.For rehydration cover the tray with a lid and leave the tray sitting on a level bench overnight (11-16 h) to rehydrate the IPG strips thoroughly with the nucleolar sample; rehydration is crucial to successful 2D.\n",

At the end of the 10-min incubation, discard the used equilibration buffer I in its entirety by carefully decanting the liquid from the tray. To each strip then add 4 mL of equilibration buffer II, and place on an orbital shaker for a further 10 min.During this incubation either prepare SDS-PAGE gels and ensure that the stacking gel is of sufficient size to take the IPG strip, or obtain a suitable number of precast polyacrylamide gels for your samples (see\nSubheading 2.4.).Once the combs have been removed from the gels, rinse each well briefly with nanopure water using a water bottle. Working quickly, prepare sufficient 1X Tris-HCl/glycine/SDS running buffer to run the number of gels you have decided upon.Once the strips have finished incubating and the gels are prepared, melt sufficient overlay agarose in a microwave to cover the IPG strips once they are inserted into the wells.\n",

A phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation is suitable for this.To avoid RNase contamination, at all stages it is highly advantageous to use either nuclease-free or diethyl pyrocarbonae (DEPC)-treated water to make up all solutions. All work areas and equipment should be cleaned with an RNase inhibitor (such as Ambion RNaseZap), and gloves should be worn at all times. It is also advisable to use preracked RNase-free tips and prepacked RNase-free tubes. When conducting RNA work, ensure that all liquid dispensers (i.e., Gilson pipets or equivalents) are wiped with 75% ethanol, and wear suitable gloves. Be sure not to touch any part of exposed skin (i.e., your face) with the gloves; this is a bad habit that many laboratory workers have. Many people secrete DNase and RNases.It is advisable to use as thin a gel as possible; the thinner the gel, the faster and more efficient the transfer of RNA to membrane.Running agarose gels for Northern blot analysis at high voltages can result in gel warping owing to heat. It is advisable to run the gel overnight at low voltages to minimize temperatures, and it is advantageous to use a buffer recirculation pump.Touch the nylon membrane as little as possible to prevent nuclease contamination.Once they are crosslinked, membranes can be stored at -20\u00b0C for several months.Unlike isotopic 32P-labeled probes, placing the film cassette containing the membrane exposed to film at -80\u00b0C will not increase the signal of weak RNA-labeled species.Every 15 min, gently agitate the plates to ensure that the Vero cells are fully overlaid with innoculum to prevent cell desiccation.Ensure that the agarose is fully equilibrated to 42\u00b0C before addition to the media. Addition of agarose solution at temperatures higher than 42\u00b0C can damage the cells.Virus titer can vary depending on the cell type used.It is good practice to ensure that cells have not lysed but have become swollen in the buffer conditions by examining with an inverted microscope. Extra care should be taken when working with mammalian cells, as these are particularly prone to lysis at 37\u00b0C in hypotonic conditions; therefore preparation on ice is imperative.With most cell preparations, sonication of the nuclear suspension for six 10-s bursts (with 10-s intervals between each burst) has proved sufficient in our hands. In our laboratory we use a Misonix XL 2020 sonicator fitted with a microtip probe set at a power setting of 5. The optimal sonication conditions do, however, depend on the cell types used; oversonication leads to destruction of nucleoli, whereas undersonication leaves the sub cellular component intact. For best results, examine the suspension by microscopy after each round of sonication; there should be virtually no intact cells, and the nucleoli should be seen as dense, refractive bodies.\n",
