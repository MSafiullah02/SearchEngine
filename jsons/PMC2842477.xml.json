The biologic effects of IFNs are determined primarily by a set of transcriptionally activated IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). A repertoire of antiviral factors and pathways, such as dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR also known as EIF2\u03b1K2), the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) \u2212 ribonuclease L (RNaseL) pathway, Mx protein GTPases, adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1 (ADAR1), the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway, 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease ISG20, and others, play an important role in the outcome of viral infection [7], [8], [9], [10]. The direct importance of these antiviral effectors in humans is supported by earlier genetic studies showing that polymorphisms in the MxA, OAS1, OASL, and PKR genes correlate with response to IFN therapy and/or susceptibility to hepatitic C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-coV) [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",

SNPs within the 12 candidate genes, 10 kb upstream and downstream for each gene, were selected based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) tagSNP selection algorithm [22] from the Hapmap phase II (http://www.hapmap.org), Seattle SNPs (http://pga.mbt.washington.edu/), and NIEHS SNPs (http://egp.gs.washington.edu/). We applied the ldSelect program [22] on each gene for each genotype source for the Caucasian samples in those public sources, to bin SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) \u22650.05, a pairwise LD threshold of r\n2 \u2265 0.90, and successful Illumina predictive genotyping scores. We then used the SNPPicker program to postprocess and refine the selection of computed tagSNPs to accommodate a set of platform-dependent design constraints. In addition, a list of putative functional \u201cobligate\u201d SNPs (coding: nonsynonymous, synonymous, 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 untranslated regions) with a MAF \u22650.05 was provided to SNPPicker to choose in preference to other tagSNPs or add to the final list. A total of 114 SNPs were selected on the basis of this approach. The nomenclature used for the description of the variants follows that described by den Dunnen and Antonarakis [23].",

Simple linear regression was used for rubella antibody levels, which had only one measured value per individual. Repeated measure approaches were implemented for the cytokine secretion variables, simultaneously modeling all six observed measurements (three unstimulated values and three virus-stimulated values). The primary test of significance assessed the degree to which the SNP was associated with stimulation-induced differences in the response, and was obtained from the covariate reflecting the genotype-by-stimulation status interaction. We accounted for within-subject correlations without imposing any constraints on the nature of the correlations. Primary tests of association assumed an ordinal SNP effect, based on the number of copies of the minor allele.",

This information was used to define haplotype design variables that reflected the number of each of the haplotypes that were expected to be carried by each subject. Analyses were performed on these haplotype design variables using the simple least squares regression approach for antibody levels and the repeated measures approach for the cytokine secretion described earlier. Because of the imprecision involved in estimating the effects of low-frequency haplotypes, we considered only those occurring with an estimated frequency of greater than 1%. Because of phase ambiguity, haplotype-specific medians and inter-quartile ranges could not be calculated. Thus, descriptive summaries were represented using the t-statistics corresponding to the haplotype main effect term for antibody levels or the haplotype-by-stimulation status interaction term for all immune measures.",

We found 10 significant associations (p \u2264 0.05) in coding or regulatory SNPs, all belonging to genes of the OAS system and seven belonging to OAS1 (although the SNPs were clustered in two LD blocks, Fig. 1).

Increased representation of the minor allele for all of these SNPs was associated with an allele dose-dependent increase of IL-2 secretion (Table 3).

Our data provide evidence for 23 OAS SNP associations with different measures of rubella-virus specific immune response. As demonstrated in the published data [27], [28] and evidenced from our data (Fig. 1), SNPs at the OAS1 region cluster into two LD blocks and at least six SNPs (including rs10774671) cluster in a LD block with functional importance. Among these are rs3741981 in exon 3, rs10774671 in intron 5 (at the splice-accepter site), rs1051042 in exon 6, and rs2660 in the 3\u2032 UTR. SNPs rs10774671, rs1051042, and rs2660 are in virtually complete LD and form two haplotypes affecting differential splicing and highly associated with the OAS1 enzyme activity [27], [28]. The functional SNP is believed to be rs10774671, for which the more common A allele is predicted to ablate the specific splice site resulting in isoforms with lower enzyme activity, whereas the G allele is predicted to allow splicing resulting in the production of the p46 isoform with higher enzyme activity. Heterozygotes were reported to have intermediate OAS activity [27]. Notably, recent work with West Nile virus provides compelling functional evidence that rs10774671 is a risk factor for WNV infection in humans and that early WNV replication in human lymphoid tissue may be regulated by the OAS1 SNP genotype [28].",

This same polymorphisms is suggested to be functional in a genetic study of type 1 diabetes [32]. In this respect, it is worth noting that the only viral infection proven to cause type 1 diabetes in humans is congenital rubella. In our study, the OAS1 Ser/Gly candidate functional polymorphism cross-regulated rubella virus-specific Th1/IL-2 and IL-10 secretion levels. IL-2 is a multifunctional Th1 cytokine with a wide spectrum of effects on the immune system, including immune activation [33]. IL-10, a key immunoregulatory cytokine during infection, is produced by different cell types, mainly antigen-presenting cells and T cells, and plays a critical role in immune regulation inhibiting the activity of Th1 cells, NK cells, and macrophages [34], [35]. It is biologically plausible to suggest that one or more linked causal polymorphisms in the OAS gene cluster can finely tune the cytokine balance and thereby influence the adaptive immune response to a live viral vaccine. Finally, potentially interesting findings in our study include polymorphisms in the promoter and regulatory regions of OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 (some in LD), associated with virus-specific IL-2, IL-10, and IL-6 secretion and antibody levels. Because complex trait associations are more likely dependent on several/multiple genetic variants, it is reasonable to suggest that the observed effects in our study may be a result of several functional genetic variants. Accordingly, the global tests and individual haplotypic analyses revealed significant correlations between OAS1 haplotypes and rubella virus-specific cytokine secretion. The most common major allele haplotype GGGCACAGG (which identifies the major allele A of the splicing variant SNP rs10774671), was associated with lower rubella virus-specific IL-2 secretion and higher IL-10 levels, whereas the minor allele haplotype AAAAGGGAA (which identifies the G allele of SNP rs10774671), was significantly associated with higher IL-2 secretion. Thus, haplotype analyses provide additional evidence that OAS gene polymorphisms might be involved in the mechanisms underlying immune response heterogeneity to rubella vaccine.",

Additional analyses of phenotype/genotype SNP associations in Caucasians only revealed similar results as those presented for the whole study cohort. Another benefit is that the LD tagSNP selection approach we used [22] selects a maximally informative set of SNPs for analyses using LD, which allowed us to infer genotypes/haplotypes and associations for SNPs of interest (like splicing variant rs10774671, recently implicated in antiviral response [28]) with a high degree of confidence. The precise quantitative immune profiling of the study subjects allowed us to look for allele dose\u2013related variations as well as cross-regulation patterns for the genetic variants, which increased our confidence in the observed associations. However, we are aware of some limitations to the present study. The results cannot be extrapolated to other ethnic groups given that these primarily concern Caucasians. The issues of multiple testing and possible false-positive associations are also of concern in any study like this. Assuming independent tests of association, we would expect 39 associations to be statistically significant by chance alone (at the p = 0.05 level), while we observed 48 associations (including intronic), which is suggestive that at least some of the effects are real. We choose the less stringent cutoff value of 0.05 because our study is the first to examine the effect of antiviral gene polymorphisms on vaccine-induced immunity and we believe that the risk of false negatives outweighs that of false positives. As with any statistical association, the study needs to be replicated in an independent cohort to validate the findings, which we are planning. Another legitimate concern is that some of the observed differences in immune measures associated with different SNP alleles appear moderate and it is difficult to assign biologic or clinical importance to them. Although the effect of a single functional polymorphism (that either alters gene expression or protein structure) on immunity as a complex trait outcome is more likely to be small, there remains doubt over functionality of certain genetic variants. At this point in our understanding of the cytokine network as a highly regulated system, there is still far too much complexity in the interplay between cytokines and other components of immunity, to be able to define or predict the effect of even moderate variations on cell-mediated immunity or humoral immunity. Validation studies with increasing sample size or meta-analyses in concert with functional studies are key to resoling questions regarding SNP functionality [37].",
