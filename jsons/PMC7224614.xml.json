It is an inherently idiosyncratic interaction during which the experience, clinical judgment, and biases of the surgeon are distilled into a focused conversation between caregiver and patient, with the goal of reaching agreement and, ultimately, permission to proceed with a recommended intervention. Ideally, the surgeon weaves data and evidence (\u201cfacts and figures\u201d) extracted from textbooks, published scientific literature, and other sources into a narrative tailored to fit the needs of the patient including the perceived appetite of that patient for information.2 An open-ended opportunity to ask questions and to express fears and concerns is essential, and surgeons should balance expressions of reassurance and empathy with appropriate expectation-setting around the more likely outcomes including the possibility of significant complications. The informed consent discussion is particularly challenging for riskier procedures with less certain outcomes. The advantages of a patient-oriented, shared decision-making model have been articulated by Schwarze et al, who propose using best-case, worst-case scenarios as an anchoring framework.3",

Although there have been anecdotal reports of adverse outcomes in asymptomatic patients, we caution against extrapolation of these early reports as definitive evidence of increased risk.7 We believe patients should know this is an area of ongoing uncertainty and investigation.",

Moreover, treatment of postoperative complications may be impacted by limitations in diagnostic or interventional services including imaging, interventional radiology, or endoscopy due to COVID-19 disruptions in services. A patient who requires emergency room evaluation or readmission due to complications that develop after hospital discharge may be impacted by bed availability or other shortages of future resources later in the course of the pandemic.",

We frame the increased importance of documentation in the context not only of concerns over increased perioperative risk but also the impact of visitor restrictions that may limit the ability of surrogate medical decision-makers to interact with caregivers at the bedside. Given the uncertain perioperative risks and anecdotal reports of unexpectedly sudden (though, we hope, rare) decompensation and cardiorespiratory arrest in postoperative patients subsequently found to carry previously unsuspected COVID-19 disease, we believe that prior documentation of patient preferences is particularly important during this pandemic to allow care teams to make critical, time-sensitive medical decisions that respect the wishes and dignity of the patient.",
