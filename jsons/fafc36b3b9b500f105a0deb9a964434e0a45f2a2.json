The exit strategy 450 is aimed at a tradeoff between limited spreading and maximizing relaxation of social 451 distancing. Two exit strategies have been considered: a progressive relaxation (blue arrows), 452 and alternatively the adaptive COVID-19 cruise control (ACCC-green arrows). In the 453 progressive scenario, an emergency brake is activated if ICU needs grow beyond the ICU 454 emergency threshold level (E), or if the daily ICU growth rate exceeds a threshold level (e).455 The ACCC incorporates a biweekly adjustment of social distancing measures to flatten toward 456 a targeted nominal ICU capacity. Relaxed social distancing steps are taken at evaluation toll 457 gates (1) and (2). The relaxing measures need to be adjusted in time to constraining measures 458 to avoid unsolicited growth above nominal ICU capacity. To this end, restrictive measures are 459 taken at toll gate (3). For the ACCC, the dashed and solid arrows denote the default and 460 adjusted ICU trends due to the measures at the tollgates.",
