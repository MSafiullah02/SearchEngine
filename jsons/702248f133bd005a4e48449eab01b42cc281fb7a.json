Initial analysis of reports indicated a possible 2085 severe group A streptococcal infections in 2003 across England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands. 3 Fifty-five per cent of the cases were male. Analysis of information available through questionnaires and routine sources indicate that 90 per cent of cases presented with bacteraemia, with or without a primary focus of infection. Among cases for which a specific diagnosis was available 10 per cent presented with septic arthritis, 9 per cent with pneumonia, 6 per cent with toxic shock-like syndrome, 5 per cent with necrotizing fasciitis, 3 per cent with puerperal sepsis, and just over 1 per cent with meningitis. One in five of the cases were reported as having died within seven days of initial diagnosis, broadly in line with the previous enhanced surveillance period (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) where the overall mortality rate was 27 per cent. 4 The enhanced surveillance of invasive group A streptococcal infections currently underway in the United Kingdom is a major component of the European Commission, Fifth Framework Programme (QLK2.CT-2002-01398) on 'Severe Streptococcus pyogenes disease in Europe' (Strep-EURO). 5 The main aims are to determine and compare the overall disease burden, type distributions and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates and clinical manifestations of severe group A streptococcal disease across 11 European countries. The UK enhanced surveillance is a joint collaboration between the HPA Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory and the Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance Department and commenced on 1 January 2003 for a period of 2 years. 6",

Overall trends in Salmonella in humans continue to be downward, despite there was a sharp rise in non-phage type 4 Salmonella enteritidis in England and Wales, although this was not seen in Scotland and Northern Ireland. At least some of this increase in 2002 was due to multiple outbreaks associated with raw shells eggs used in commercial food preparation.
