            "text": "Because of the discrepancy between the published murine ACE2 mRNA transcript sizes (2.7 and 3.2 kb, BC026801 and NM_027286, respectively) and the larger transcript suggested by our Northern blot (\u223c3.4 kb), we hypothesized that there may be additional undescribed 5\u2032 sequence of ACE2, particularly in light of the recent identification of a 5\u2032 exon 1a in human ACE2 (AB193259) [Itoyama et al., 2005]. By RT\u2010PCR using a forward primer in the 5\u2032 region of homology to human exon 1a and a reverse primer in the 5\u2032 end of exon 1, we amplified a 219 bp product in adult mouse lung (Fig. 1B). Using genomic DNA as a template with the same primers produced a \u223c1,200 bp product (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the intron between the putative exon 1a and exon 1 is approximately 1\u20131.5 kb. With 5\u2032\u2010RACE (Fig. 1C) we confirmed the presence of a 188\u2010bp exon 1a of murine ACE2 that shares 74% nucleotide identity with human ACE2 (sequence and homology to human ACE2 exon 1a shown in Fig. 1D). By sequence analysis this exon is located on chromosome X from position 159,483,486 to 159,483,673 and does not appear to be a coding sequence. The various ACE2 transcripts we have identified both with and without exon 1a are shown in a schematic (Fig. 2A) and confirmed by RT\u2010PCR in adult lung (Fig. 2B). Because of the RT\u2010PCR primers used (illustrated in Fig. 2A), transcripts 1 and 3 may not be full\u2010length transcripts but rather incomplete fragments of the longer transcripts 2 and 4, respectively, lacking the 3\u2032 untranslated region (Fig. 2A,B). However, the presence of the polyA tail in the 3\u2032 end of the 2.7 kb transcript 3 (BC026801) does suggest a complete mRNA transcript. Nonetheless, only transcripts 2 and 4 (Fig. 2A,B) have been submitted as novel mRNAs of ACE2 to the NIH GenBank for registration. By reprobing our initial Northern blot with a probe specific for exon 1a, we confirmed that exon 1a is present in both the 2.8 and 3.4 kb transcripts identified in the mouse lung and kidney (data not shown). By RT\u2010PCR the 3.4 kb transcript containing exon 1a (transcript 2 from Fig. 2A) is present in all tissues tested including adult kidney, heart (in low levels), testis, and lung, embryonic day (E) 18.5 lung, and the Clara cell line mtCC (Fig. 2C).",

            "text": "Western blot analysis confirms the presence of ACE2 protein in adult mouse lung, kidney, heart, and testis, as well as in all cell lines tested (Fig. 3A). The published literature describes five different molecular weights for human ACE2, based on glycosylation and cleavage [Lambert et al., 2005]. In the mouse lung, 125 kDa [Imai et al., 2005] and 75 kDa [Gembardt et al., 2005] species of ACE2 have been reported, and an 89 kDa [Ye et al., 2004; Wysocki et al., 2006] form of ACE2 has been reported in the mouse kidney. By Western blot analyses using an antibody to the membrane\u2010bound C\u2010terminus of ACE2 (Fig. 3A) or an antibody against the N\u2010terminal ectodomain of ACE2 (Fig. 3B), we have identified all of the previously described protein species of ACE2. The major protein species in the lung appears to be 75\u201380 kDa, although the 120 kDa form is also present at lower levels. In contrast, the major species in other tissues tested is the 105\u2013120 kDa isoform, although the kidney also expresses the 80 kDa form. The mtCC Clara cell line appears to express three protein species, 80, 85, and 120 kDa. The other pulmonary and proximal tubule cell lines appear to contain primarily the 80 kDa (MLE\u201015, BUMPT\u20107) or 85 kDa (E10, MFLM\u20104) forms of ACE2. Western analysis with either antibody reveals a strongly immunoreactive species at 180 kDa (Fig. 3A,B). In order to provide evidence that the immunoreactivity of these bands is specific for ACE2, we used a third antibody against an internal ACE2 peptide for which the antigenic peptide is available (Fig. 3C\u2013E). Preincubation of the antibody with an excess of peptide blocked binding to the 75\u201380 kDa protein species observed in the E10 cells, adult lung, and adult kidney, as well as to the 180 kDa species in the E10 cell line. This lends considerable support to the interpretation that all of the observed bands represent ACE2.",

Specifically, by our methods ACE2 protein is present in Clara cells but not detectable in ciliated bronchiolar epithelium (Fig. 5A\u2013D), present in smooth muscle cells and endothelium of some but not all medium to large arterioles and venules but not detectable in alveolar capillaries (Fig. 5B,C,E,I), and present in type II alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 5F\u2013H) but not detectable in type I cells. Antibody staining shows that ACE2 protein is preferentially localized in the apical plasma membrane of Clara cells (Fig. 5C,D) but is more diffusely distributed with an intracellular pattern in type II cells (Fig. 5F\u2013H). This raises the possibility that the two cells may express different transcripts or different protein isoforms. Alveolar macrophages stain positive for ACE2 in some sections, as has been reported previously [Imai et al., 2005; Ren et al., 2006], but our competitive inhibition studies with ACE2 control peptide reveal this staining to be non\u2010specific (data not shown). On E18.5 ACE2 is present in the non\u2010ciliated bronchiolar epithelium but was not detected in the distal lung or vasculature (Fig. 5J\u2013K) by our methods. Given that there has been definitive localization of ACE2 in the kidney and heart reported previously [Donoghue et al., 2000; Lely et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2004; Gembardt et al., 2005; Warner et al., 2005; Wysocki et al., 2006], we also localized ACE2 in the adult mouse kidney (Fig. 5L\u2013P) and heart (Fig. 5Q) as a validation of our immunohistochemical methods and antibodies. ACE2 localization in the mouse kidney is similar to that previously reported for the human [Lely et al., 2004; Warner et al., 2005] and mouse [Ye et al., 2004; Gembardt et al., 2005] with specific staining in the proximal tubular epithelium brush border (Fig. 5N\u2013O) and in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of small to medium vessels (Fig. 5P). There was no staining in the renal medulla and very weak staining in glomeruli (Fig. 5L\u2013M). In the mouse heart the myocardial capillaries show strong staining for ACE2 (Fig. 5Q), as has been previously reported in the human [Donoghue et al., 2000].",

We also demonstrate that there are multiple protein isoforms of ACE2, and that the major isoform in the lung differs from those in the other tissues we analyzed. We show through immunostaining that ACE2 in the lung is primarily epithelial, as opposed to endothelial in other tissues, and is specifically localized to Clara cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells. The finding of high levels of both ACE2 mRNA and protein in the Clara cell line mtCC supports our conclusion that Clara cells are a key source of ACE2 in the intact mouse lung. While message levels of ACE2 were low by QRT\u2010PCR in the other cell lines studied, including the types I and II cell lines, the pulmonary endothelial cell line, and the proximal tubule cell line, Western blot analyses demonstrate the presence of ACE2 protein in these cell lines. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 is developmentally regulated in the embryonic mouse lung with an expression pattern that matches those of other Clara cell and peripheral lung epithelial genes with a large increase in message levels between E17.5 and E18.5.",

            "text": "Although the finding of two distinct transcripts on Northern blot of mouse lung and kidney has been previously reported [Komatsu et al., 2002], the prior study describes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.8 kb, while we have identified transcripts of 2.8 and 3.4 kb based on markers. The size discrepancy between the larger of these transcripts and the published ACE2 mRNAs in the GenBank (AB053182, 1,993 bp; AB053181, 2,760 bp; 2,739 bp, BC026801; and 3,268 bp, NM_027286) led us to seek additional 5\u2032 sequence here identified as exon 1a of murine ACE2. We initially speculated that the 3.4 kb transcript containing exon 1a might code for the previously undescribed 180 kDa protein isoform that we identified in lung, kidney, and E10 cells using multiple different antibodies to ACE2. However, sequence analysis shows exon 1a to be non\u2010coding, and its 188 bp sequence is likely too short to explain the larger molecular weight if it were translated. The largest molecular weight reported for ACE2 based on the amino acid sequence when fully glycosylated is 125 kDa [Imai et al., 2005]. The 180 kDa protein species is similar in molecular weight to ACE, which has a molecular weight in the mouse of 170 kDa [Ye et al., 2004; Wysocki et al., 2006], raising the possibility that ACE2 antibodies might not discriminate between these two proteins. However, we do not believe that this is the case because the manufacturer indicates that the Abcam anti\u2010ACE2 we used does not cross\u2010react with ACE. Furthermore we performed peptide inhibition studies using a different antibody (Santa Cruz) that show the 180 kDa isoform to be specific for ACE2. We do not yet know what accounts for this larger molecular weight. One possibility is that the ACE2 protein is tightly bound to another protein(s) from which it is not dissociated in the Western conditions we used, a possibility supported by previous information on ACE2 [Lin et al., 2004]. Lin et al. 2004 have shown that human ACE2 from failing myocardium co\u2010precipitates with integrin \u03b21 and that this complex migrates at a molecular weight of 130 kDa, suggesting that one of the lower molecular weight ACE2 isoforms is part of the complex. Further studies of murine lung ACE2 will be required to resolve this issue. The other ACE2 isoforms we found in mouse lung (75\u201380, 85, 105, 120 kDa) are likely due to glycosylation and cleavage events, as has been previously described for human ACE2 [Lambert et al., 2005].",

We found low mRNA levels in the E10, MLE\u201015, MFLM\u20104, and BUMPT\u20107 cell lines and higher levels in the mtCC cell line. When ACE2 proteins in these cells were examined, we observed an apparent discrepancy: mRNA levels were very low but proteins were easily detected. This relationship has been observed previously for murine ACE2 by Gembardt et al. 2005, who found low levels of ACE2 mRNA in the mouse heart by RNase protection assay but very strong protein expression in this organ by Western blot. This suggests that the ACE2 message may be very stable but not abundant in some murine cell types, with low levels of mRNA being translated into moderate amounts of protein. Alternatively, the ACE2 protein may be relatively resistant to degradation and thereby accumulate in higher amounts than the lower message level would ordinarily predict.",

One possible explanation is that the smaller isoform represents the epithelial variant of ACE2 that predominates in the lung, while the 120 kDa form represents the endothelial variant of ACE2 that predominates in most other tissues. This would be consistent with the finding that the lung, which has endothelial ACE2 expression in some but not all vessels, also contains lesser amounts of the 120 kDa isoform, while the kidney, which expresses ACE2 in the proximal tubule epithelium and in the endothelium of the blood vessels, contains both the 120 kDa and the 80 kDa isoforms. The mtCC Clara cell line expresses three protein isoforms of ACE2, which does not necessarily fit with this model. Insight into possible differential expression of mRNA and protein isoforms in epithelial and endothelial cells will require a number of approaches including in situ hybridization and analysis of primary cells isolated from the lung.",

ACE2 has been identified as a target gene of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (HNF1\u03b2) [Senkel et al., 2005]. This transcription factor is exclusively expressed in epithelial cells [Coffinier et al., 1999]. In the lung Coffinier et al. 1999 have shown HNF1\u03b2 to localize by immunostaining most strongly to the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium with weaker staining in the alveolar epithelium in both E16 and adult mouse lung. In situ hybridization of lungs of mice infected with SARS coronavirus, which binds to ACE2, show viral RNA in the distal bronchiolar epithelium [Glass et al., 2004]. Moreover, the few immunohistochemical [Gembardt et al., 2005] and in situ hybridization [Imai et al., 2005] studies of the mouse lung suggest that ACE2 is present in alveolar [Gembardt et al., 2005] and airway [Imai et al., 2005] epithelium, although the specific cell types expressing ACE2 are not clear based on these studies. With the methods we used ACE2 protein is detected in an apical distribution in Clara cells but not ciliated cells of the bronchiolar epithelium, in type II but not type I alveolar epithelial cells, and in the endothelium and smooth muscle of some but not all small to medium blood vessels in the adult mouse lung. In the fetal lung ACE2 mRNA expression peaks at E18.5 and ACE2 is detectable in the distal, non\u2010ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells. This developmental increase in ACE2 expression correlates well with the known time course of fetal Clara cell differentiation, as determined by marked increase in CC10 expression, which occurs between E15.5 and E18.5 [Keijzer et al., 2001].",

The ACE2 knock\u2010out mouse has not been reported to have any lung pathology in either fetuses or adults, although the detailed reports on the phenotype of the unstressed ACE2 knock\u2010out mouse focused specifically on the heart [Crackower et al., 2002] and kidney [Oudit et al., 2006]. This suggests that there may be redundant proteins with overlapping functions to ACE2 in normal lung biology. Although ACE2 is known to cleave substrates other than angiotensin II [Vickers et al., 2002], its function in degrading angiotensin II is presumed to be the most significant [Vickers et al., 2002] and is the best studied. In this role ACE2 acts as a counterbalance to ACE in the regulation of the renin\u2010angiotensin system. The presence of ACE2 in the pulmonary epithelium is likely to relate to this role as a critical component of the renin\u2010angiotensin system.",

The relevance of these observations to normal lung biology is unclear because many of these studies have used angiotensin II concentrations that far exceed those found in the normal mouse lung [Wei et al., 2002]. While apoptotic cells have been demonstrated by TUNEL staining in the healthy rat lung during post\u2010natal development [Schittny et al., 1998], the overall importance of apoptosis in the normal lung remains uncertain. By contrast, strong evidence supports the role of apoptosis in the injured lung, in which the hyperplastic type II cells commonly observed during alveolar epithelial repair are removed by programmed cell death [Bardales et al., 1996]. Whether angiotensin II is a critical mediator of apoptosis in these settings is not known, but studies have shown that autocrine generation of angiotensin II is required for both Fas\u2010induced [Wang et al., 1999a] and TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced apoptosis [Wang et al., 2000] in primary cultures of type II cells. Using the ACE2 knock\u2010out mouse as a model, Imai et al. 2005 and Kuba et al. 2005 have clearly demonstrated that ACE2 is able to protect against acute lung injury by catalyzing angiotensin II. This lends support to the possibility that angiotensin II is an important mediator of alveolar epithelial cell injury and death, and that by regulating angiotensin II levels, ACE2 itself plays a critical role in the injured lung. Further studies need to be done to elucidate more definitively the normal function of ACE2 in the mouse lung, and in the pulmonary epithelium in particular.",
