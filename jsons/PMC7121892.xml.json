The last 90 years have seen two World Wars, massive air and missile attacks by the military on civilians distant from battle areas, many terrorist attacks, and widespread ethnic strife. Genocide killed one million persons in Rwanda; millions have become refugees and tens of thousands have died in Darfur in the Sudan in Africa.

As the human race has increasingly been able to cope with such basic needs as food and shelter, some of the very coping mechanisms involved (such as the double edged consequences of agricultural pesticides), have generated new risks for human societies (Beck, 1999; Perrow, 1999). For example, in 2004, toxic chemicals were successfully used to eradicate massive locust infestations affecting ten Western and Northern African countries. Those very chemicals had other widespread negative effects on humans, animals and crops (IRIN, 2004). Implicit in this line of thinking is the argument that double-edged consequences from new innovations (such as the use of chemicals, nuclear power and genetic engineering) will continue to appear (Tenner, 1996).",

However, there is clear evidence that in Egypt in the 20th Century BC, the 12th Dynasty Pharaoh, Amenemher II completed southwest of Cairo what was probably history\u2019s first substantial river control project (an irrigation canal and dam with sluice gates). Other documentary evidence indicates that dams for flood control purposes were built as far back as 1260 B C in Greece (Schnitter, 1994, p. 1, 8\u20139). Such mitigatory efforts indicate both the belief that there was a long-term natural risk as well as one that could be coped with by physically altering structural dimensions.",

For example, earthquake resistant building techniques were developed in ancient Rome, although \u201cthey had been forgotten by the middle ages\u201d (Massard-Guilbaud et al., 2002, p. 31). The threats from floods and fires spurred mitigation efforts in Greece. Starting in the 15th Century, developing urban areas devised many safeguards against fires, varying from regulations regarding inflammable items to storage of water for firefighting purposes. In many towns in medieval Poland, dams, dikes and piles along riverbanks were built (Sowina, 2002). Of course, actions taken were not always successful. But, if nothing else, these examples show that organized mitigation efforts have been undertaken for a long time in human history.",

One has been the routinization of responses by emergency oriented groups so as to prevent emergencies from escalating into disasters or crises. For example, in ancient Rome, the first groups informally set up to fight fires were composed of untrained slaves. But when a fire in 6 A.D. burned almost a quarter of Rome, a Corps of Vigiles was created that had full-time personnel and specialized equipment. In more recent times, there are good examples of this routinization in the planning of public utilities that have standardized operating procedures to deal with everyday emergencies so as to prevent them from materializing into disasters. In the conflict area, there are various UN and other international organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union (EU), that also try to head off the development of crises. In short, societies have continually evolved groups and procedures to try to prevent old and new risks and threats from escalating into disasters and crises.",

Societies for about a century have been creating specific organizations to deal first with new risks for civilians created by changes in warfare, and then improving on these new groups as they have been extended to peacetime situations. Rooted in civil defense groups created for air raid situations, there has since been the evolvement of civilian emergency management agencies (Blanchard, 2004). Accompanying this has been the start of the professionalization of disaster planners and crisis managers. There has been a notable shift from the involvement of amateurs to educated professionals.",

The same analysis notes that large cities such as Baghdad, Moscow, Aleppo, Mexico City, Budapest, Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki all suffered massive physical destruction and lost huge numbers of their populations due to disasters and wartime attacks. All were rebuilt and rebounded. At the start of the 19th Century, \u201csuch resilience became a nearly universal fact\u201d about urban settlements around the world (Vale & Campanella, 2004, p. 1).

There is far from full agreement that all disasters and crises can be categorized together as being relatively homogeneous phenomena (Quarantelli, 1998; Perry & Quarantelli, 2005). This is despite the fact that there have been a number of attempts to distinguish between, among and within different kinds of disasters and crises. However, no one overall view has won anywhere near general acceptance among self-designated disaster and crisis researchers. To illustrate we will briefly note some of the major formulations advanced.",

The basic assumption was that the inherent nature of the agent involved made a difference.

Most researchers have since dropped the distinction as hazards have come to be seen as less important than the social setting in which they appear. In recent major volumes on what is a disaster (Quarantelli, 1998; Perry & Quarantelli, 2005), the distinction was not even mentioned by most of the two dozen scholars who addressed the basic question.",

The assumption here is that different community level social phenomena are involved, depending on the referent. Thus, some scholars distinguish between consensus and conflict types of crises (Stallings, 1988 tries to reconcile the two perspectives). In some research circles, almost all natural and most technological disasters are viewed as consensus types of crises (Quarantelli, 1998). These are contrasted with crises involving conflict such as are exemplified by riots, terrorist attacks, and ethnic cleansings and intergroup clashes. In the latter type, at least one major party is either trying to make it worse or to extend the duration of the crisis. In natural and technological disasters, no one deliberately wants to make the situation worse or create more damage or fatalities.",

Boin, McConnell, & \u2018t Hart, 2008). In some crises, the overall intent of major social actors is to deliberately attempt to generate conflict.

For example, looting behavior is distinctively different in the two types. In the typical disaster in Western societies, almost always looting is rare, covert and socially condemned, done by individuals, and involves targets of opportunity. In contrast, in many conflict crises looting is very common, overt and socially supported, undertaken by established groups of relatives or friends, and involves deliberately targeted locations (Quarantelli & Dynes, 1969). Likewise, there are major differences in hospital activities in the two kinds of crises, with more variation in conflict situations. There are differences also in the extent to which both organizational and community-level changes occur as a result of consensus and conflict crises, with more changes resulting from conflict occasions (Quarantelli, 1993). Finally, it has been suggested that the mass media system operates differently in terrorism situations and in natural and technological disasters (Project for Excellence in Journalism, 1999, 2001).3\n",

From there it moved through Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. It spread quickly around the world because international plane flights were shorter than its incubation period. At least 774 infected persons died. It hit Canada with outbreaks in Vancouver in the West and Toronto far away in the East. In time, 44 persons died of the several hundred that got ill, and thousands of others were quarantined. The city\u2019s healthcare system virtually closed down except for the most urgent of cases with countless procedures being delayed or cancelled. The result was that there was widespread anxiety in the area resulting in the closing of schools, the cancellation of many meetings and, because visitors and tourists stayed away, a considerable negative effect on the economy (Commission Report, 2004, p. 28). The Commission Report notes a lack of coordination among the multitude of private and public sector organizations involved, a lack of consistent information on what was really happening, and jurisdictional squabbling on who should be doing what. Although SARS vanished worldwide after June 2003, to this day it is still not clear why it became so virulent in the initial outbreak and why it has disappeared (Yardley, 2005).",

There are two major possibilities with respect to impact (McGuire, 2000; Wisner, 2004). A landing in the ocean would trigger a tsunami-like impact in coastal areas. Just the thinking of the possibility of how, when and where ahead of time coastal population evacuations might have to be undertaken, is a daunting thought. Statistically less likely is a landing in a heavily populated area. But a terrestrial impact anywhere on land would generate very high quantities of dust in the atmosphere, which will affect food production as well as creating economic disruption. This would be akin to the Tambora volcanic eruption in 1813, which led to very cold summers and crop failures (Post, 1977). The planning and management problems for handling something like this would be enormous.",

The possible good outcomes and products from such activity are tremendous (Morton, 2005) and are spreading around the world (Pollack, 2005). But the double-edged possibilities mentioned earlier are also present. There is dispute over genetically modified crops, with many European countries resisting and preventing their use and spread in their countries. While no major disaster or crisis from this biotechnology has yet occurred, there have been many accidents and incidents that suggest that this will be only a matter of time. For example, in 2000, StarLink corn, approved only for animal feed is found in the food supply, such as taco shells and other groceries. The same year farmers in Europe learned that that they had unknowingly been growing modified canola using mixed seed from Canada. In 2001, modified corn was found in Mexico even though it was illegal to plant in that country. That same year, experimental corn that had been engineered to produce a pharmaceutical that was found in soybeans in the state of Nebraska. In several places, organic farmers found that it was impossible for them to keep their fields uncontaminated (for further details about all these incidents and other examples, see Pollack, 2004). Noticeable is the leaping of boundaries and uncertainty about the route of spreading. It does not take much imagination to see that a modified gene intended for restricted use, could escape and create a contamination that could wreak ecological and other havoc.",

We should be able to do a better job than we have so far in making projections about the future. But perhaps that is asking more of disaster and crisis researchers than is reasonable. After all, social scientists with expertise in certain areas, to take recent examples, failed completely to predict or forecast the non-violent demise of the Soviet Union, the peaceful transition in South Africa, or the development of a market economy in communist China (cf.

Instead, those focused on the social in the broad sense of the term should be studying social phenomena. Our view is that what should be looked at more is not the possible agent that might be involved, but the social setting of the happening. This becomes obvious when researchers have to look at such happenings as the 2004 Southeast Asia tsunami or locust infestations in Africa. Both of these occasions impacted a variety of social systems as well as involving social actors from outside those systems. This led in the tsunami disaster to sharp cultural clashes regarding on how to handle the dead between Western European organizations who came into look mostly for bodies of their tourist citizens, and local groups who had different beliefs and values with respect to dead bodies (Scanlon, personal communication with first author).",

There is a tendency, at least in the US after 9/11, to think that all future crises and disasters will be new forms of terrorism. One can see this in the creation of the US Department of Homeland Security, which repeated errors in approach and thinking that over 50 years of research have shown to be incorrect (e.g., an imposition of a command and control model, assuming that citizens will react inappropriately to warnings, seeing organizational improvisation as bad managing, see Dynes, 2003).

It is hard to believe that countries that currently have no functioning national government, such as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo or marginally operatives ones such as Afghanistan, will have the same reaction to disasters and crises as societies with fully functional national governments.

This is consistent with those disaster researchers and scholars (e.g., Oliver-Smith, 1994) who have argued that studies in these areas have badly neglected the historical context of such happenings.

Extreme heat waves and massive blizzards are hardly new weather phenomena (Burt, 2004). There have recently been two heat waves, however, that have new elements in them. In 2003, a long lasting and very intensive heat wave battered France. Nearly 15,000 persons died (and perhaps 22,000\u201335,000 in all of Europe). Particularly noticeable was that the victims were primarily socially isolated older persons. Another characteristic was that officials were very slow in accepting the fact that there was a problem and so there was very little initial response (Lagadec, 2004). There was a similar earlier happening 1995 in Chicago not much noticed until reported in a study seven years later (see Klinenberg, 2002). It exhibited the same features, that is, older isolated victims, bureaucratic indifference, and mass media uncertainty.",

This created a cascade of power failures that resulted in blackouts in cities from New York to Toronto and eventually left around 50 million persons without power, which, in turn, disrupted everyday community and social routines (Ballman, 2003). It took months of investigation to establish the exact path of failure propagation through a huge, complex network. Telecommunication and electrical infrastructures entwined in complex interconnected and network systems spread over a large geographic area with multiple end users. Therefore, localized disruptions can cascade into large-scale failures (for more details, see Townsend & Moss, 2005).",

This was accompanied by the widespread cancellations of religious and sport events. There was across the board disruption of air, road and train services. All of this resulted in major economic losses in the millions of dollars. There were scattered interruptions of critical life systems. The governor issued a state of emergency declaration and the state as well as local emergency management offices fully mobilized. To be sure, what happened did not fully rival what surfaced in the Canadian blizzard discussed earlier.

Viewed this way, the newer kinds of communities can be seen as very important in planning for and managing disasters and crises that cut across national boundaries.

Future work should focus more on the generating conditions. A general model would involve the following ideas. The first is to look at social systems (societal, community and/or organizational ones), and to analyze how they have become more complex and tightly coupled. The last statement would be treated as a working hypothesis. If that turns out to be true, it could then be hypothesized that systems can break down in more ways than ever before. A secondary research thrust would be to see if systems also have developed ways to deal with or cope with threatening breakdowns.

In short, what has to be looked for are genotypic characteristics not phenotypic ones (Perry, 2004). If whales, human beings, and bats can all be usefully categorized as mammals for scientific research purposes, maybe students of disasters should also pay less attention to phenotypic features. If so, should other disruptive phenomena like AIDS also be approached as disasters?
