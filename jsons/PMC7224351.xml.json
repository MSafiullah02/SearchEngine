            "text": "The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2) (OMIM: 300335), also known as ACEH, is attached to the cell membrane of the outer layer tissues of the heart, arteries, lungs, kidney and intestines. It is located on Xp22.2 and encoded an 805-amino-acid-long protein and belongs to the family of angiotensin-converting enzyme of dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidases [1, 2]. ACE2 contains a 17-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide and a 22-amino acid C-terminal membrane anchor. It also has a conserved motif at the zinc metalloprotease consensus sequence (HEXXH) and a conserved glutamine residue at Glu-402 that served as a third zinc ligand [1]. ACE2 is also has homologous to the human ACE, which plays a role in cleaving angiotensin I into angiotensin 1\u20139, and vasoconstrictor angiotensin II peptide into the vasodilator angiotensin 1\u20137 [3, 4]. ACE2 correspondingly acts as the entry point into cells for several coronaviruses. By cleaving angiotensin II and increasing vasodilator angiotensin 1\u20137, it may act as an important regulator of heart function [1, 5] and plays a protective role in acute lung injury. The expression of ACE2 in organ- and cell-specific implies its regulatory role of cardiovasculature, kidneys and fertility. Potential anti-tumor effects of ACE2 and future therapeutic perspectives for cancers in ACE2 have been reported [6, 7]. Unfortunately, ACE2 has a high affinity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Importantly, ACE2 is a key host cell receptor for the spike (peplomer) glycoprotein of the coronavirus HCoV-NL63, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [8], and the very recently reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [9\u201311]. Diseases associated with the ACE2 gene include SARS, COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Hartnup disorder [10, 12, 13]. This might provide a clue that suppressing the expression levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight the viral infection.",

            "text": "Since its first report in December 2019 [14], the COVID-19 is rapidly spreading worldwide and the number of cases is rising with increasing pace across all countries [15, 16]. Due to its invasive spread, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on Mar. 11, 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) [17]. The onset of COVID-19 causes progressive respiratory failure and even death due to alveolar damage in lungs, because the virus enters host cells through the enzyme ACE2, which is expressed extremely highly in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs. As of the 20th of March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of identified cases is about 4.1% overall, ranging from 0.2 to 15% depending on age and other preliminary health issues. The binding affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 is nearly 10- to 20-fold higher than that between ACE2 and SARS-CoV [18, 19]. Hence, in ACE2-expressing cells and tissues, ACE2 gene is the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays a critical role in the viral entry into the cells during infection, and it also has potential anti-tumor roles in cancer. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of the ACE2 gene for COVID-19 in different normal tissues and cancer tissues as a prognostic marker in renal and liver cancer.",

This finding is consistent to Harmer et al. reports, showing its highest expression is in the testis, renal tissues and cardiovascular tissues, and all portions of the gastrointestinal tract [29]. IHC analysis using ACE2 antibody in normal testis tissues showed that ACE2 is presented high staining in cells of seminiferous ducts and leydig. High level of ACE2 expression in the testis, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might not only attack the lung, but also other organs namely the testis, and may affect sexual development for younger boys and cause infertility in adult males if they had been infected by the SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, the results showed high expression of Ace2 transcript in the lungs of the mouse but low in humans. However, Itoyama et al. [2] identified an alternative 5-prime untranslated exon and found expression of the alternative 5-prime exon in various major organs including in the lungs, demonstrating that different Ace2 transcripts existed. However, this does not discount the possibility that the ACE2 expression in the lungs of humans may truly be lower. With this regard, we looked at the expression levels by western blotting in human normal tissues, and we found that the ACE expression in the lungs is truly very low, comparing to the testis tissues (link here: https://www.abcam.com/ace2-antibody-ab15348.html). Taken together, even though lung cells may be the main target cells of SARS-CoV-2, other organs may also be vulnerable [30], particularly in the testis which may lead to male infertility if he had COVID-19.",

Since ACE2 might play potential anti-tumor effects of and future therapy for cancer [6, 7], we analyzed ACE2 expression and its clinical significance associated with survival rates of cancer patients. In cancer tissues, renal cancer and a few cases of colorectal and liver cancer exhibited moderate to strong membranous immunoreactivity to ACE2; the remaining cancer tissues were all generally negative. RNA-sequencing indicated that mRNA levels of ACE2 were enhanced in renal and liver cancer. Further survival analyses showed that high expression of ACE2 is correlated with longer survival in renal and liver cancer, indicating that ACE2 is a prognostic marker in both renal cancer and liver cancer.",

Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection may most likely affect male infertility. On the other hand, high expression of ACE2 is correlated with long survival in renal and liver cancer, indicating that ACE2 is a prognostic marker in both renal cancer and liver cancer. The binding affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 is nearly 10- to 20-fold higher than that between ACE2 and SARS-CoV [18, 19]. Hence, ACE2-expressing cells and tissues can potentially act as targets of the novel coronavirus. With all this combined, ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and has potential anti-tumor role in cancer and may pose conflicting medical benefits and concerns. Altogether, this study may not only provide potential clues for further clinical management of COVID-19 pathogenesis and possible male fertility, but it might also indicate the clinical significances of the ACE2 gene in mortality rates of certain cancers.",
