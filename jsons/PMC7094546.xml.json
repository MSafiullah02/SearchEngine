            "text": "Evaluation of serum components is one of the least invasive approaches to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. There is considerable potential to exploit this approach even further than at present. Indeed, the impact of a number of serum proteins in disease diagnosis and prognosis is not fully known, limited in large part by the availability of rapid, quantitative assays. A case in point is the serum glycoprotein leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG). LRG was first purified from human serum in 1977 (Haupt and Baudner, 1977) and its amino acid sequence was determined 8 years later (Takahashi et al., 1985). The glycoprotein has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa and contains 23% carbohydrate by weight (Haupt and Baudner, 1977). It is comprised of repetitive sequences with a leucine-rich motif and leucine residues make up 17% of the amino acid composition (Takahashi et al., 1985). Based on mRNA analysis, LRG is predicted to be expressed by liver cells (NCBI GDS 182, GDS 423, and GDS 2068) and by neutrophils (O'Donnell et al., 2002) and is up-regulated in a mouse model of inflammation (Norkina et al., 2004). The function of LRG is not known, although it has been shown to bind cytochrome c (Cyt c; Cummings et al., 2006) and has been hypothesized to play a role in cell survival (Thompson et al., 2007).",

Employing this assay we examined serum levels of LRG in patients with a variety of disorders including inflammatory arthritis, neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), toxic shock syndrome (TSS) resulting from infection with Staphylococcal aureus bacteria, and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). C-reactive protein (CRP), a prominent acute-phase protein, was also quantified and compared to LRG to determine if the two biomarkers are redundant or provide different clinical information.",

For adsorption on DEAE-Sephacel (40 ml; Sigma-Aldrich Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO) the supernate from 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation of serum was dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Stepwise two-fold increases in sodium chloride concentration beginning at 40 mM resulted in the elution of human LRG at 160 mM sodium chloride. The eluate containing LRG was adsorbed to 1 ml horse Cyt c-Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS, 3 \u00d7 10 ml), and eluted stepwise with 4 ml 0.05 M acetic acid followed by 0.5 M acetic acid. The 0.05 M acetic acid eluate which contained approximately 80% of the LRG was lyophilized, dissolved in 200 \u03bcl 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, dialyzed against 1 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, and passed through 200 \u03bcl of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) to remove any acidic proteins that may have bound to the Cyt c-Affi-Gel 10 column due to electrostatic interactions (Haupt and Baudner, 1977). Protein purity was assessed by Gel Code Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels (4 to 20% acrylamide gradient; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The concentration of LRG was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient (1 mM) of 32.8 as calculated from the amino acid composition (Gill and von Hippel, 1989).",

The protein was dissolved at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM in PBS, pH 7.4 and 50 \u03bcl were adsorbed for 1.5 h to 96 well MaxiSorp plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, N.Y.). The plates were washed twice in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, then dilutions of purified human LRG as standards or human sera diluted 500-fold or greater were added to the wells for 1.5 h After two washes, mouse anti-human LRG mAb (1 \u03bcg/ml in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100), was added to each well and incubated for 1.5 h The plates were washed twice and incubated with 50 \u03bcl of a 1/2000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Chem. Co.). After 1.5 h, the plates were washed three times and citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 containing substrate (hydrogen peroxide) and color indicator (o-phenylenediamine) was added to each well to 100 \u03bcl. The reaction was allowed to continue for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 50 \u03bcl 4 N sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 492 nm was determined employing a Titertek Multiskan plate reader (Flow Laboratories, McClean, VA.). Serum samples were assayed in triplicate. LRG concentrations were determined from averaged absorbance readings and a standard curve plotted as a sigmoid dose response equivalent to the 4 parameter logistic equation employing the Prism 4.03 program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was also analyzed employing the Prism 4.03 program.",

Nevertheless, to assess whether Cyt c or some other component in serum might bind LRG and interfere with its quantification in the ELISA, serum (diluted to 10% in PBS) was passed through a 1 ml column of Sepharose beads to which the LRG-specific mAb was covalently bound and adsorbed proteins were eluted in 0.5 M acetic acid, then electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE. The complex of purified LRG and Cyt c, formed in vitro using purified LRG and Cyt c in a molar ratio of 4:1, was effectively adsorbed by the mAb-coupled beads (Fig. 2\nA). In this experiment the molar ratio of Cyt c to LRG in the bound complex was calculated to be 0.7 based on the extinction coefficients of the two proteins at 410 nm and 280 nm. When the concentration of Cyt c relative to LRG in the incubation solution was increased to 20 fold, the molar ratio of the two components in the complex approached 1.0 (results not shown).",

In another experiment, in which bands from a gel similar to that in 2B and 2C were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a Cyt c-specific mAb using a sensitive chemiluminescent reaction for detection, we also did not observe Cyt c adsorbed from the sera of either control subjects or TSS patients, although purified Cyt c was detected (Fig. 2D, lane 3).

Based on the yield of LRG during its purification from pooled human serum, the concentration of LRG was previously estimated to be 21 \u03bcg/ml (Takahashi et al., 1985). The lower amount quantified in the earlier study is likely due to loss of protein during the purification process. The slight variation in the average LRG level within the same pool of control subjects among the experiments in the present study may be due to differences in the preparations of LRG employed as standards in each of the experiments.",

As shown in Fig. 5\n, two TSS patients with the highest levels of serum LRG had low to moderate levels of CRP. Note that the median level of CRP in healthy individuals is 1.5 mg/ml (Ridker, 2003). Two TSS patients with extremely high CRP levels had only slightly elevated levels of LRG and two other TSS patients with extremely high LRG levels had normal levels of CRP.

Employing an LRG-specific mAb to immunoprecipitate LRG along with bound Cyt c, we could not detect Cyt c associated with LRG in human sera using a Western blot sensitive to picogram quantities (Fig. 2). In a competitive ELISA, soluble Cyt c-mediated inhibition of LRG capture only began to be observed at a concentration 5-fold higher than the upper limit of Cyt c estimated to be present in normal serum. However, complete inhibition was observed at 150-fold higher concentration indicating that caution in interpreting the results of the ELISA described herein will be required in patients with high serum Cyt c levels. Because LRG has been shown to inhibit Cyt c detection in at least one sandwich ELISA format (Cummings et al., 2006), both LRG and Cyt c levels should be measured for optimal clinical assessment of these two biomarkers.",

Our previous finding that LRG binds Cyt c (Cummings et al., 2006) and that LRG competes with Apaf-1 for binding Cyt c (Thompson et al., 2007) suggest that LRG may be an anti-apoptotic factor allowing survival of cells in response to stress signals. In support of this hypothesis, the LRG gene is up-regulated in lung and muscle cells within 24 to 48 h following exposure to poisons (NCBI GDS 234, GDS 1244) and then it is downregulated by 72 h LRG and Apaf-1 mRNAs are also inversely expressed in many tissues in the mouse including the liver, suggesting opposing functions (NCBI GDS 2068). In regard to cancer, LRG mRNA expression was found to be elevated in 5 of 10 ovarian cancer cell lines examined, consistent with an increase in serum LRG in at least half of ovarian cancer patients (NCBI GDS 1523). It remains to be determined whether LRG in sera of cancer patients is produced by the cancer cells or some other tissues, such as the liver or neutrophils. In their study of pancreatic cancer, Kakisaka et al. reported that cultured pancreatic cancer cells did not secrete LRG. LRG was also not observed in cells infected with the coronavirus causing SARS (Jiang et al., 2005). The elevated LRG in serum could result from the body's defense against cancer or could be a reaction of the liver to serum factors increased in response to cancer.",
