Huge number of studies tried to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417 and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution from a single mutant to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies. Our results also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely a lab engineered virus.",

Then, the optimized structure is inputted to MCCE (Multi Conformer Continuum Electrostatic) software 16 to sample the protonation states of the amino acids using Monte Carlo. The electrostatic interactions between the different amino acids' conformers are calculated by solving Possion Boltzmann equation using DELPHI. 17 The generated conformers' occupancies based on Boltzmann distributions are used to calculate the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the amino acids in the SARS-CoV and the ACE2. However, to study the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2, we constructed the following mutants (V404K, R426N, Y442L, L443F, F460Y, L472F, N479Q, D480S, Y484Q, T487N) based on the cryoEM structure PDB ID 6M17. 7 The mutations were performed by replacing the sidechains in the native structures with the proper sidechains of the mutants using MCCE. Several confirmations of the sidechains were created to void van der Waals clashes. The sidechain conformers with the highest Boltzmann occupancies were then MD optimized. The MCCE was then used to calculate the binding energies based on the optimized structures.",

            "text": "The optimized structure of SARS-CoV shows salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-R426 and ACE2-E329, which dominates the electrostatic interactions with the ACE2. This salt-bridge is replaced by another salt-bridge formed between CoV-2-K404 and ACE2-D30 in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2) . However, the CoV2-K404/ACE2-D30 salt-bridge has more favorable electrostatic. attractions by 1.4 Kcal/mol ( Table 1 ). The total electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 are stronger by 3 Kcal/mol than SARS-CoV (Table S1 ). The contribution from the mutants themselves to the electrostatic binding energies is very small (Table S1 ). Furthermore, these mutants induce structural changes that increase the favorable van der Waals interactions in SARS-CoV-2. The maximum van der Waals attractions of -1.6 Kcal/mol are observed between CoV-Y457 and ACE2-T27 for SARS-CoV, while for SARS-CoV-2 the maximum attraction is -2.1 Kcal/mol observed between CoV2-D491 and CoV2-K353 ( Table 1 ). The total van der Waal's contribution to the binding energy in case of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than SARS-CoV by ~ 4Kcal/mol. In total, the electrostatic and van derWaalsattraction between the SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 is stronger by ~7 Kcal/mol than the SAR-CoV. Several studies proposed that increased virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the increased binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. 3,6,7 Yan et al., proposed that mutation 404 \u2192 417 may result in higher binding affinity due to the salt bridge between K417 and D30, while the 426 \u2192 439 mutation weaken the interaction with E329. However, our simulations show that the 404 \u2192 417 mutation increases the binding affinities by favorable electrostatic energies more than the energy loss induced by 426 \u2192 439 mutation. Additionally, mutation 472 \u2192 486 was proposed to weaken van der Waals contact with Met 82 of ACE2. On the contrary, the relaxed structure shows a van derWaalsattraction of -1.32 Kcal/mol. 7 The structural changes induced by these mutations likely confer stability to CoV-2 as it binds to ACE2. This agrees with the study of Ortega et al., 8 where they found that two main residues (479 and 487) have been associated with human ACE2 recognition. They further found a higher number of residues in the CoV-2 capping loops and attributed the more favorable binding affinity of -15.7 Kcal/mol as opposed to -14.1 Kcal/mol for CoV. 8 Based on our calculations, there is no significant contribution from a single mutant to the binding energies between the SARS and the ACE2. However, these mutations induce sophisticated structural changes that enhance the electrostatic and van der Waals binding energies (Table S1) . These results might also support the idea that it is unlikely that the SARS-CoV-2 is lab engineered but rather a result of a biological evolution. 18 ASSOCIATED CONTENT Supporting Information.
