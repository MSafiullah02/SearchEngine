            "text": "Manipulating the cell cycle machinery in order to sustain their own replication is a common mechanism employed by different viruses (Emmett et al., 2005). Among the three check points of cell cycle at G1/S, G2/M and the metaphase/anaphase boundary, G1/S is the time window where cell decides for growth or quiescence depending on environmental conditions (Bartek and Lukas, 2001). During the hours preceding the G1 phase, Retinoblastoma (Rb) remains in hypo phosphorylated form, which can bind and inhibit a group of transcription factors (like E2F) responsible for transcribing genes required for replication as well as cell cycle progression (Giacinti and Giordano, 2006). When cell gets stimuli essential for the G1 to S phase transition, Rb becomes hyperphosphorylated and loses ability to bind and inhibit E2F, which then translocates to nucleus and induces expression of genes like thymidine kinase, thymidine synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase, cyclins and CDKs required for G1 to S phase transition (Harbor and Dean, 2000, Fan and Bertino, 1997). Ca+2/CaM-stimulated proteins, including the family of multifunctional Ca+2/CaM-stimulated protein kinases (CaMK), have been identified as one of the important mediators among several stimuli that induce cell cycle progression (Kahl and Means, 2003). CaMKI induces Rb phosphorylation and cyclin D1 upregulation and CDK 4 activation for overall G1 to S phase transition (Skelding et al., 2011).",

DNA viruses are extensively studied for cell cycle manipulation as primary site of their replication is in the nucleus. To support viral replication small DNA viruses lacking their own polymerase, such as simian virus 40 (DeCaprio et al., 1988, Fanning and Knippers, 1992), human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990) and adenovirus (Eckner et al., 1994, Howe et al., 1990) promote cell cycle progression to S phase. To avoid competition with host for replication machinery large DNA viruses (herpes viruses) arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase (Flemington, 2001). Retroviruses such as HIV type 1 arrests cell cycle in G2/M phase by employing Vpr protein for proper viral gene expression (Goh et al., 1998, He et al., 1995). Single stranded RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is cytoplasm were also been found to affect host cell cycle either inducing G2/M phase arrest (infectious bronchitis virus) (Dove et al., 2006) or G0/G1 arrest (murine corona virus, Influenza virus) (Chen and Makino, 2004, He et al., 2010), however whether self-limiting double stranded RNA viruses like RV manipulates cell cycle remains largely unknown.",

As shown in\nFig. 1A significant accumulation (20\u201332%) of infected cells in S phase was observed during early time point of infection (2\u20136 hpi), compared to mock infected cells (10\u201311%) in a strain independent manner. Whereas at 8 hpi number of cells in S phase was not significantly higher (14\u201316%) in case of all the three strains, compared to uninfected controls (10\u201311%) and at later time points (10\u201312 hpi) no of cells started to increase in sub G0 phase compared to uninfected control (Fig. 1A). To confirm the direct effect of RV on host cell cycle machinery, MA104 cells were synchronized in G1 phase by serum starvation and were infected with SA11 at 3 moi or kept mock infected followed by cell cycle analysis using flowcytometry. Cell cycle analysis revealed an increased accumulation of cells (20\u201330%) in S phase in SA11 infected cells compared to mock infected cells (9\u201310%) (Fig. 1B). To know whether this cell cycle modulation is viral replication dependent or not, SA11 was inactivated with UV irradiation (Li et al., 2009) and MA104 cells were infected with UV inactivated virus or live virus. Cells were collected at indicated time points and subjected to flowcytometry analysis. It was found that viral replication is necessary for cell cycle manipulation as no significant accumulation of infected cells in S phase was observed in UV inactivated virus infected cells whereas active live virus induced S phase accumulation (Fig. 1A). Thus overall results suggest RV manipulates cell cycle machinery to drive cells from G1 to S phase.",

To know the phosphorylation status of Rb during RV infection, MA104 cells were infected with the RV SA11 strain (at a moi of 3) and incubated for 0\u20138 hpi. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with phospho Rb specific antibody. Compared to mock infected cells RV infection induced Rb hyper phosphorylation during early infection (2\u20136 hpi) but from 8 hpi onwards the Rb phosphorylation was reduced (\nFig. 2A lower panel). Furthermore, to monitor the downstream effect of Rb phosphorylation, nuclear fractions of same set of experiments was immunoblotted with E2F specific antibody to analyze level of activated E2F. Results revealed increased translocation of E2F into nucleus during early infection (2\u20136 hpi), which is concurrent with Rb hyper phosphorylation (Fig. 2A upper panel) confirming the G1 to S phase stimulation during the early hours of RV infection. In addition to nuclear translocation, expression of E2F gene was also induced during RV infection as assessed by immunoblotting and real time PCR (Fig. 2B). Functionality of increased nuclear translocation of E2F was further validated by assessing expression of different E2F regulated genes such as thymidine kinase, thymidine synthase and dihydrofolate reductase in SA11 infected MA104 cells by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, all three E2F regulated genes were significantly upregulated during 2\u20134 hpi consistent with nuclear translocation of E2F.",

Compared to mock infected cells expression of both transcript and protein levels of Cyclin D1, cyclin D3 and CDK4, CDK6 was induced in SA11 infected cells during 2\u20136 hpi followed by decrease at 8 hpi. Cyclin E1 and CDK2 transcripts were induced as early as 2 hpi but significant increase in protein level were observed at 4\u20136 hpi (\nFig. 3A and B). As expression of both CDK and Cyclin increased during infection, kinase activity of CDK4, CDK6 and CDK2 was evaluated by immunoprecipitating cyclin-CDK complexes from SA11 (3 moi) infected and mock infected cells. The kinase activity of cyclin-CDK complex was measured by incubating (30 min at 37 \u00b0C) them with specific substrates such as Rb for CDK4, CDK6 and Histone H1 for CDK2 in vitro in specific kinase buffer followed by immunoblotting with pRb and pHistone H1 specific antibody. Increases in activity were observed for CDK4, CDK6 during early infection (2\u20136 hpi) whereas CDK2 was transiently activated only at 4\u20136 hpi (Fig. 3C). Activation of CDKs depends on the level of CDK inhibitors. To assess whether RV modulates expression of CDK inhibitors to regulate cell cycle, whole cell lysates or total RNA of MA104 cells infected with either SA11 (3 moi) or mock infected were subjected to either immunoblotting or real time PCR with p15, p21, p27 specific antibodies or primers, respectively. Results revealed that representative CDK inhibitors of both INK4 and CIP/KIP family were significantly down regulated during early SA11 infection (2\u20136 hpi) (Fig. 3D and E).",

            "text": "CAMKI is a CaM activated kinase which regulates G1 to S phase progression of cell (Skelding et al., 2011). In a previous study from our group, CaM level was found to be modulated during RV infection (Weinberg, 1995). To know the activation level of CaMKI during RV infection, MA104 cells were infected with the RV SA11 strain (at a moi of 3) and incubated for 0\u20138 hpi. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with phospho CaMKI and CaM specific antibody. Results indicated increased phosphorylation (activation) of CaMKI along with upregulation of CaM expression during initial time points of infection (2\u20136 h), followed by decrease at 8 hpi (\nFig. 4A). To delineate relation between CaMKI activation and cell cycle progression, MA104 cells were either infected with RV SA11 strain at 3 moi or kept mock infected in presence or absence of either calcium chelator BAPTA-AM which chelates Ca+2 ions (Chattopadhyay et al., 2013) and inhibits CaM activation or CaM inhibitor W7 which bind selectively to CaM and inhibit its downstream functions (Dhillon et al., 2003), for indicated time points followed by cell cycle analysis using flowcytometry (treatments were done post viral absorption). Quantitive analysis revealed that both BAPTA-AM and W7 inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase as found in only SA11 infected MA104 cells (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of CAMKI activation by using BAPTA-AM and W7 was proved by immunoblotting the cell extracts of SA11 infected or mock infected MA104 cells treated with BAPTA-AM and W7 with phospho CaMKI specific antibody (Fig. 4C). To define the mechanism behind Ca+2/CaM activated CaMKI mediated cell cycle manipulation, we assessed the levels of Rb phosphorylation and E2F translocation to nucleus during SA11 infection in presence or absence of BAPTA-AM or W7 treatment. Both BAPTA-AM and W7 significantly minimized Rb phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of E2F compared to only virus infected cells (\nFig. 5A). To know the effect of Ca+2 chelation and CaM inhibition during SA11 infection on cyclins, CDKs and CKIs associated with G1 to S phase transition, MA104 cells were either infected with SA11 or kept mock infected in presence or absence of either BAPTA-AM or W7 followed by immunoblotting with CDK2, CDK6, cyclin E1, cyclin D1, p27 and p21 specific antibodies. No significant change in expression level of cyclins and CDKs was observed in SA11 infected cells in presence of W7 or BAPTA-AM compared to mock infected control (Fig. 5B) confirming Ca+2/CaM dependent CaMKI mediated upregulation of cyclin and CDK expression (Fig. 3A) during RV infection. But in case of CKIs, following RV infection, expression of p21 and p27 was downregulated both in presence (Fig. 5B) or absence (Fig. 3D) of BAPTA-AM and W7 suggesting that CKI regulation is Ca+2/CaM independent.",

Result revealed in G0/G1 synchronized cells, viral gene expression was significantly low compared to unsynchronized cells but it was significantly higher in S phase synchronized cells (Fig. 6A and B). Furthermore, viral titers were measured by plaque assay in unsynchronized MA104 cells or cells synchronized at G0/G1 phase or at S phase following infection with SA11 strains at 1 moi. Compared to cells synchronized at G0/G1 phase significantly higher viral titers were observed in cells synchronized at S phase or unsynchronized cells (Fig. 6C). This is consistent with NSP3 expression pattern suggesting increased rotaviral replication during S phase.",

In our current study we found RV also influences cell cycle status of infected cells by propelling them from G1 to S phase in a strain independent manner (Fig. 1A). Replication of RV is important for cell cycle manipulation as UV inactivated viruses could not drive G1 to S phase transition (Fig. 1A) as well as level and activity manipulation of cell cycle machinery proteins (data not shown).",

D type cyclins (Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3) preferably binds and activates CDK4 and CDK6 to hyper phosphorylate Rb and free the E2F protein to induce the expression of cyclin E1 and CDK2 which after forming the holoenzyme retains the hyper phosphorylated state of the Rb molecule (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009). Concurrent to Rb phosphorylation pattern, all the CDKs involved in G1 to S phase transition were activated during early hours of infection (Fig. 3C). Formation of active cyclin-CDK complex depends on expression level of Cyclins and CDKs (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009), manipulation of which might be one of the mechanisms employed by viruses to activate CDK complex. As speculated up-regulation of all the cyclins and CDKs was observed at both transcript or protein levels during early infections (Fig. 3A and B). Other than the expression level of cyclins and CDKs which is essential for formation of the holo enzyme, CKIs play an important regulatory role to control CDK activation. There are two families of CKIs, CIP/KIP and INK4 family. The CIP/KIP family of proteins includes p21, p27 and p57, which are specific inhibitors of kinase activity of all type of CDKs; by contrast compounds of the INK4 family (p15, p16, p18, p19) prevent the association as well as function of only CDK4, CDK6 and D type cyclins (Besson et al., 2008). During RV infection, in addition to up-regulation of cyclins and CDKs, members of CKIs were significantly down-regulated at both transcript and protein levels, which may have additive effect on CDK activation (Fig. 3D and E). The level of change in transcript and protein levels of cyclins, CDKs or CKIs did not correlate exactly at all time points (Fig. 3A, B, D, and E) which could be due to inhibition of translation of cellular proteins by different mechanisms (like inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport) (Rubio et al., 2013, Padilla-Noriega et al., 2002).",

Blockage in S to M phase transition is employed by different viruses (Luo et al., 2013b, Luo et al., 2013a) to recruit cellular replication factors for viral replication. In case of rotavirus this could be due to stabilization of microtubules (Eichwald et al., 2012). In RV infection after accumulation of cells in S phase till 6 hpi, no of cells in G0/G1 phase started to increase (6 hpi and onwards) keeping consistency with the level of cyclins, CDKs, which started to decrease and CKIs, which were upregulated during 8 hpi.

            "text": "Modulation of Ca+2 signals at various stages of the cell cycle and its role in cell cycle progression has been reported (Berridge et al., 2000) and Ca+2 concentrations was found to be increased during RV infection (Brunet et al., 2000). Versatile and complex Ca+2 signaling activates different Ca+2 binding proteins which then further modulate distinct cellular responses (Machaca, 2010). CaM is one of the important downstream effectors of Ca+2 which gets activated after binding Ca+2 (Chin and Means, 2000) and its expression levels have been linked to cell cycle progression both experimentally and physiologically (Choi and Husain, 2006). CaM expression is significantly increased during the G1\u2013S transition (Chafouleas et al., 1982, Chafouleas et al., 1984). Increased expression of CaM during early hours (2\u20136 hpi) of RV infection has been observed in differential proteomics study by our group (Weinberg, 1995). CaM has been shown to activate several family of proteins namely serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, adenyl cyclises, ion channels, phosphodiesterases, myosin light chain kinases and protein phosphatises (Chin and Means, 2000) of which Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases have been shown to modulate cell cycle (Skelding et al., 2011). CaMKI has been shown to induce G1 to S phase transition (Skelding et al., 2011), concurrently activation of CaMKI (phospho CaMKI) was also observed during early RV infection (2\u20136 hpi) which correlated with increased CaM expression and accumulation of cells in S phase (Fig. 4A). Significance of Ca+2/CaM signaling in modulation of cell cycle during RV infection was confirmed when Ca+2 chelator (BAPTA-AM) and CaM inhibitor (W7) inhibited G1 to S phase transition (Fig. 4B). Rb phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of E2F was also inhibited in presence of BAPTA-AM or W7 (Fig. 5A). Similar to Rb phosphorylation, expression levels of cyclins, CDKs were not modulated in presence of BAPTA-AM or W7 during RV infection (Fig. 5B), however the CKIs namely p21 and p27 were down regulated both in presence (Fig. 5B) or absence (Fig. 3D) of BAPTA-AM or W7. Down regulation of P21 and p27 is probably regulated by p53 which has been shown to be downregulated during early hours of RV infection (Bhowmick et al., 2013). Overall results suggest role of Ca+2/CaM signaling in RV induced G1 to S phase transition. Ca+2/CaM signaling is also important for RV replication as in presence of BAPTA-AM or W7 reduced viral titers were observed (Chattopadhyay et al., 2013, P\u00e9rez et al., 1998).",

AZT inhibits DNA replication by inhibiting thymidine kinase and preventing deoxythymidine triphosphate formation as a result it synchronizes cells at S phase (Chandrasekaran et al., 1995) whereas terfenadine prevents Rb phosphorylation and induce the level of CKIs to prevent cell cycle progression and synchronizes cells at G0/G1 phase (Liu et al., 2003). In RV infected S phase synchronized cells, increased viral gene expression and viral titers were observed whereas cells blocked in G0/G1 phase had reduced viral gene expression and titers compared to unsynchronized cells infected with SA11 confirming that RV induces G1 to S phase transition for enhanced viral replication.",

The results suggests a novel mechanism i.e. Ca+2/CaM activation, employed by RVes to drive cells to accumulate in S phase by manipulating expression and activity of cell cycle regulatory proteins involved in G1 to S transition similar to hepatitis B virus (Yang and Cho, 2013, Benn and Schneider, 1995). Increase of cells in S phase during initial stages of infection was found to be beneficial for viral life cycle, which may be due to either stabilization of MT network during S phase which is helpful for viroplasm translocation (Eichwald et al., 2012) or increase in host replication proteins such as topo-isomerase during S phase which may assist in rotaviral replication as reported in case of ebola virus infection (Takahashi et al., 2013). It is also possible that S phase accumulation provides an anti-apoptotic environment for proper completion of viral replication cycle.",
