Four additional Pestivirus species have been proposed but remain officially unrecognized: (i) Pestivirus of giraffe, associated with an outbreak of mucosal-like disease in giraffes in the Nanyuki District of Kenya; (ii) Pronghorn virus, isolated from a blind pronghorn antelope in the United State; (iii) Bungowannah virus, detected in pigs following an outbreak of stillbirths and neonatal death in Australia, and (iv) a group of viruses variously referred to as HoBi-like, BVDV-3, or atypical pestiviruses (Bauermann et al., 2013).",

HoBi-like viruses contaminating FBS of southern American origin were later detected worldwide. All these viruses were proposed to belong to a new pestivirus species tentatively termed BVDV-3. However, there is no agreement among pestivirologists about this proposal, considering the genetic and antigenic distance of the new viruses from other BVD viruses (Bauermann et al., 2013). Unlike BVDVs, HoBi-like viruses do not appear to be endemic in all continents. In South America, the virus has been associated with reproductive disorders in Brazilian cattle herds, and death of water buffalos as well (Cortez et al., 2006). The first European Hobi-like virus, strain Italy-1/10-1, was isolated from calves with severe respiratory disease in southern Italy (Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2012c). Additional Hobi-like viruses were associated to abortion in multiparous cows of the same herd (Decaro et al., 2012a) and to respiratory disease in cattle of a neighboring Italian region (Decaro et al., 2013b). In addition, natural infection of cattle with HoBi-like virus resulted in the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves (Decaro et al., 2013a). More recently, outbreaks of mucosal disease (MD) have been observed in that country (Decaro et al., 2014) and in Brazil (Weber et al., 2014). Evidence of HoBi-like virus in Asia has been also reported. Although no clinical sign was noted, seroconversion to HoBi-like viruses was observed in dairy herds in Thailand and one virus positive calf serum was identified (Kampa et al., 2010). In Bangladesh, HoBi-like viral sequences were detected in samples from animals displaying diarrhea, respiratory distress and/or fever (Haider et al., 2014). Divergent strains were identified more recently in India (Mishra et al., 2014).",

Viral RNA was extracted from nasal and rectal swabs using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy), whereas RNA extraction from the WBC pellets was obtained using the QIAamp\u00ae RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A.). HoBi-like RNA copy numbers were calculated on the basis of the standard curves generated by 10-fold dilutions of a synthetic RNA obtained by in-vitro transcription of a plasmid containing the 5\u2032 UTR of the isolated strain. Reverse transcription was carried out using GeneAmp\u00ae RNA PCR (Applied Biosystems, Applera Italia, Monza, Italy), following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The quantitative assay targeting the 5\u2032 UTR was conducted in a 50 \u03bcl-reaction mixture containing 25 \u03bcl of IQ\u2122 Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl), 600 nM of primers T134-F (5\u2032-GACTAGTGGTGGCAGTGAGC-3\u2032) and T220-R (5\u2032-GAGGCATTCCTTGATGCGTC-3\u2032), 200 nM of probe T155r-P (6FAM\u2013 5\u2032-ACTCGGGGCTTCGGTGATCCAGGG-3\u2032-BHQ1) and 20 \u03bcl of c-DNA. The thermal profile consisted of activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0 C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0 C for 15 s and annealing-extension at 60\u00b0 C for 1 min. To confirm the successful infection of the experimental animals and rule out concurrent infections with other pestiviruses, a nested PCR (nPCR) assay recently developed for detection and characterization of pestiviruses was employed (Decaro et al., 2012e). This assay is able to type correctly all pestiviruses infecting cattle by using virus-specific nPCR primers, whereas BDV and CSFV are detected only by the first-round amplification but do not react with nPCR oligonucleotides. RT-PCR (first-round amplification) was carried out using SuperScript\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and the following thermal protocol: reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, inactivation of Superscript II RT at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, 68 \u00b0C for 1 min, with a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and visualization under UV light after bromide ethidium staining. Nested PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold (Applera Italia, Monza, Italy) The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl containing PCR buffer 1X (KCl 50 mM, Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8,3), MgCl2 2 mM, 200 \u03bcM of each deoxynucleotide (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), 1 \u03bcmol l\u22121of the RT-PCR reverse primer and of each internal species-specific primer, 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold and 5 \u03bcl of a 1:100 dilution in distilled water of the primary PCR product. The thermal conditions consisted of activation of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase at 94 \u00b0C for 10 min and 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 30 s and polymerization at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min.

In the present study, ewes at different ages of pregnancy were infected with an isolate of the novel pestivirus species in order to assess whether the sheep is a suitable model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines against HoBi-like viruses. The two gestational periods were selected in order to maximize the effects of pestivirus infection on the ovine pregnancy; in the case of BDV infection, these effects have been reported to be more evident before the development of immunocompetence, which is usually reached before 60 days of pregnancy (Nettleton et al., 1998). All but one infected ewes underwent reproductive failures that included abortion (n\n = 3), stillbirth (n\n = 4) or generation of PI lambs (n\n = 4). Similar results were obtained from cows experimentally infected with HoBi-like pestivirus at about 70 days of gestation. Of the seven inoculated pregnant cows, one aborted at 8 month of gestation, whereas the other six animals gave birth to PI calves (Bauermann et al., 2014).",

When fetuses infected at this stage of pregnancy survive, they become tolerant of the virus and are born with a persistent viremia in the absence of any immune response. PI calves and lambs are the main source of virus shedding in the environment, thus contributing to perpetuate pestiviral infections in the herds/flocks.

A striking finding in our study was the birth of a PI lamb that displayed low viral titers in all body fluids and in the blood, having at the same time HoBi-like pestivirus antibodies. It has already reported that PI calves may develop an immune response against the homologous virus that results from changes in BVDV quasispecies sequences that arise as the PI animals mature. Few amino acid changes in the E2 protein, the major antigenic determinant of pestiviruses, were able to induce VN antibodies in PI animals (Collins et al., 1999, Collen et al., 2000). Although no sequence analysis was conducted in the present study, a similar mechanism could also explain the presence of VN antibodies in a PI lamb, considering that the animal was tested before colostrum assumption and remained highly seropositive at an age when the maternal immunity should have declined. According to this scenario, mounting of the immune response may have led to control the viral replication, thus accounting for the less extent and duration of viremia and virus shedding with respect to the other PI animals.",

Even considering the small number of animals that were tested, these findings may have diagnostic implications if transferred to the bovine species. In fact, in abortion storms induced by HoBi-like pestivirus, the expulsion of the fetus may occur several weeks after infection of the cows, leading to progressive degradation of viral RNA. Thus, the exact knowledge of the tissues harboring the highest amounts of virus may prevent misdiagnosing this infection.

To date, VN is the gold standard for detection of cattle that are positive for HoBi-like pestivirus antibodies, but the test is cumbersome and labor-intensive.
