Analyzing a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease severity, we show that overlapping peptide pools (OPP) of all three proteins can activate SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells with a stronger response of CD4 + compared to CD8 + T-cells. Although interindividual variations for the three proteins were observed, M-protein induced the highest frequencies of CD4 + T-cells, suggesting its relevance as diagnostic and vaccination target. Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest frequencies of cytokine-producing bi-and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. To this end, activation of effector T-cells with differentiated memory phenotype found in our study could cause hyper-reactive response in critical cases leading to immunopathogenesis.",

The T cell response against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus, which causes the ongoing pandemic, is presumably initiated by respiratory professional antigen presenting cells (APC) that can engulf viral antigens as shown for the 2002/03 SARS-CoV 2 . The activated T cells can migrate to the site of infection, where they facilitate viral clearance, but can also contribute to immune pathogenesis. There is mounting evidence that the latter is the major reason for critical COVID-19 disease manifestations 3, 4 .",

Due to its surfaceexposure and crucial role for infecting the host cell, the S-protein is an attractive therapeutic target, for instance for antibodies that block the S/ACE2 interaction. In fact, it was shown that patients recovered from COVID-19 developed virus neutralizing anti-S immunoglobulin (Ig) titers 7 . Given the requirement for T cell help in generation of high affinity IgG antibodies, this finding indicates that S-protein reactive T cell immunity was formed in those patients 8,9 . Accordingly, very recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 S-protein reactive T cell responses in patients suffering from moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 4, 10 .

Addressing this point, we analyzed the IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-4 cytokines as well as the effector molecule GrzB expression in parallel to differentiation stage phenotyping. Of interest, not only the quantity but also the functionality of T-cell immunity was superior in patients with critical COVID-19 severity. Polyfunctional T cells showed higher frequencies in critical COVID-19 patients compared to moderate and severe cases (Fig. 3e ,f,n,o). Antigen-reactive IFN\u03b3-, IL2-, and TNF\u03b1-producing CD4 + T cells constituted over 50% of trifunctional CD4 + T cells, while cytotoxic GrzB-producing IFN\u03b3-and TNF\u03b1-expressing CD4 + T cells constituted 25% of trifunctional CD4 + T cells (Fig. S3b) . The cytokine and effector molecule expression of bifunctional CD4 + T cells was also dominated by IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL2, and to a lesser extend GrzB ( Fig. S3c ).

As described above, SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells in our study were predominantly of TH1 phenotype.

Importantly, the presence of S-, N-, and M-reactive T-cells with an advanced differentiation phenotype early after diagnosis in our study indicates pre-existing cellular immunity as demonstrated in a recent study 10 . only one sample per patients using the last visit sample for an optimized timing match, we did not detect relevant differences to the analysis of all available samples (Fig. S4) . We also did not find any significant differences in the time after PCR-testing or after hospital admission between the groups. Nevertheless, it needs to be considered that the time point of infection in our cohort is, as in most similar studies, not known. The higher reactivity of T cells of critically ill patients might therefore mirror a longer course of response against the infection.",

In this context, our finding on advanced differentiation stage of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells found at early time points raises the question about the beneficial effect of pre-existing immunity for the course of infection. One could speculate that even though it appears to be generally protective, preexisting SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells with effector phenotype, which are cross-reactive with common cold corona viruses 10 , in severe infection can lead to hyperactive response and immunopathogenesis.",

Within the 54 responding samples, M-protein OPP induced a detectable CD4 + T cell response in the highest number of samples (M=45, N=39, S=44), whereas for the 44 responding samples within CD8 + subsets, the S protein OPP was dominant (M=30, S=36, N=30)(Fig. 1b-c). A similar observation was made for the middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS)-virus, where a higher S-protein induced CD8 + T cell and higher M-protein induced CD4 + T cells response were described15 .

To our best knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating immunogenicity of M-and N-proteins. The reactivity demonstrates individual pattern, indicating that all three proteins should be considered in cellular monitoring to avoid underestimation. Moreover, our findings suggest new potential targets of humoral immunity. Considering the role of CD4 + T helper cells for antibody generation and the higher CD4 + T-cell response against M-protein, our results highlight the M-protein as an additional target for antibody monitoring and vaccine development. Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated higher frequencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells reactive to S-, M, and N-OPP. Although the direct antiviral capacity has to be proven in future studies, the polyfunctionality of the cells might confirm their antiviral potential. To this end, the presence of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 coproducing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells indicating an effector/memory phenotype and long-term protection was also shown for the 2002/03 SARS-CoV 22,23 .

Patient gender was compared with Fisher's exact test. Differences in T cells responses of all patient samples together were analyzed with Friedman test and Dunn's multiple comparison test. As sphericity was not assumed, Geisser-Greenhouse correction was applied. Correlation between the T cell responses towards the different peptides was analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Differences in T cell responses of patient samples grouped according to COVID-19 severity were analyzed by repeated-measurement two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test. Bivariate regression analysis was performed to exclude potential bias in the analysis due to the unbalanced gender distribution of the groups. Thus, for factors significantly associated with illness severity, regression analysis was performed with gender and COVID-19 severity as independent variables, without interactions. P values below 0.05 were considered significant; only significant P values are reported. supported by grants of Mercator Foundation, the BMBF e:KID (01ZX1612A), and BMBF NoChro (FKZ 13GW0338B).",
