This \"advent of biotechnology\" took place only one decade after the discovery of the genetic code, which describes the connection between genes and the formation of proteins. The production of proteins by genetic engineering involves the incorporation of a foreign (often human) gene into an organism'so rac ell'so wn genome.T he geneticallym odifiedl ivings ystem can then express so-called'recombinant' proteins -itbecomes aliving\"protein expression system\". Well-established expression systems for pharmaceutical proteins include fermenter-grown genetically modified Escherichia coli, baker's yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or Chinesehamster ovary( CHO) cell cultures. Proteins arelinearc hainso famino acids. Informationa bout the sequence of each protein is encoded by the DNA of a gene. Expression of a protein commences when a gene is copied (transcribed) from a point termed the promoter, producing a messenger molecule or RNA. RNA is then processed to remove the non-coding regions or introns, and transported to the protein synthesis machinery. Here it is read (translated) and determines the aminoacids addedtoanew proteinmolecule.",

            "text": "Different cells require different proteins and therefore express different genes. The expression of a particular gene is controlled by the interaction of factors within the cell and DNA sequences associated with the gene. These regulatory elements include the promoter and others termed enhancers (see figure 2.1). The basics of protein synthesis are highly conserved between living organisms, and this has allowed the successful transfer and expression of genes between widely different species. However many proteins require additional steps, termed post-translational modification, before they are fully functional. The types of post translational modification vary considerably between species and between cell types. The addition of sugar side chains to amino acids, called glycosylation, provides an example. The addition of complex chains of sugar molecules linked to asparagine residues in the protein chain (N-linked glycosylation) is important for the correct folding and stability of many mammalian proteins. Most bacteria are unable to glycosylate asparagine and this is a primary reason for choosing eukaryotic expression systems, including transgenic animals and mammalian cell cultures. However, the range of possible post-translational protein modifications required for protein function is very large and includes: propeptide cleavage, multichain assembly, disulphide bonding, phosphorylation, hydroxylation, amidation, methylation, hydroxylation, \u03b3-carboxylation, acylation and lipid attachment. The repertoire of modification enzymes varies considerably between mammalian and plant tissue types. Ideally, the processing capability of the producing cells should match the requirements of the desired protein, or be readily modifiable to carry out the appropriate processing.",

            "text": "In the past decade, plant-based expression systems have emerged as a possible alternative for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins. The major reason for the development of transgenic plants for the production of biopharmaceuticals was the expectation that costs of large-scale production would be comparatively low. This has turned out to be true for proteins that can be produced at high yields. For example, recombinant avidin was produced in maize at 20 % of total soluble seed protein 3 . Then the yield of one bushel of maize was equivalent to the total yield from one tonne of chicken eggs -the natural source of avidin. This case demonstrates the potential for cost reduction. Another important reason for the development of alternative platforms for the production of biopharmaceuticals was the hope of producing biopharmaceuticals that, so far, had to be isolated from biological material since they were too complex to be produced by recombinant microorganisms or cell culture. In addition, the risk of transmission of human pathogens via the product is minimized since plants are, in contrast to for example donated blood, not a source of human pathogens. The first pharmaceutically relevant protein made in plants was human growth hormone, expressed in transgenic tobacco in 1986 4 . In this study the hormone was expressed as a fusion with the Agrobacterium nopaline synthase enzyme. Since then, many other human proteins have been produced in an increasingly diverse range of crops. In 2006 Dow AgroSciences received the world's first regulatory approval for a plant-made vaccine for animals by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 5 . It is a vaccine against Newcastle disease, which infects poultry. The vaccine is produced in genetically engineered cells from non-nicotine-producing tobacco plants and has to be administered by injection. Currently the commercialization of the chicken vaccine is not planned, since the market is already crowded. Instead, the company sought USDA approval to prime the regulatory process for other animal drugs produced in the same way 6 . Table 2 .1 provides examples of biopharmaceuticals produced in transgenic plants.",

Thef irst step in thec onstructiono fat ransgene plantf or thep roduction of biopharmaceuticals is the identification of the gene that codes for the desired protein, and subsequently the sequencing and isolation of that gene. The advances of genomics (the study of an organism's entire genome) and proteomics (the large-scale study of proteins, their structures and functions) have accelerated these steps greatly and in addition have lead to the development of new pharmaceutical applications. Once the sequence of the gene (or genes) coding forthe proteinisathandanappropriate expressionconstruct has to be developed. The expression construct needs to serve different tasks. One main aim of plant pharming is the production of recombinant proteins at high yields. To achieve this, expression construct design seeks to optimize all stages of gene expression, from transcription to protein stability. Expression constructs are chimeric structures, in which the transgene is flanked by various regulatory elements known to be active in plants. Only by the addition of these regulatory elements is the recombinant gene recognized by the molecular machinery of the host plant and subsequently synthesized. For high expression levels, the two most important elements are 2.2 Plants as a production platform for recombinant biopharmaceuticals Figure 2 .2: An outline of the overall process of plant pharming the promoter (a sequence needed to \"switch\" the expression of a gene on) and the polyadenylation sites which are often derived from the 19S and 35S transcripts of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 8 .

It has, for example, been shown in comparative experiments with recombinant antibodies that the secretory pathway is a more suitable environment for folding and assembly than the cytosol 10 . Proteins are targeted to the secretory pathway through the inclusion of an N-terminal signal peptide in the expression construct. In the absence of targeting information, proteins in the endomembrane system are secreted into the apoplast. The apoplast is the extracellular space, which is a large and continuous network of cavities under the cell wall. Proteins secreted from the cell often remain trapped here. However, yields are generally higher compared with secretion 11 .",

Several strategies have been adopted in an attempt to minimize variation in transgene expression, including the use of viral silencing suppressors 12 . Currently the minimization of positioning effects remains an active field of research.

In the wild,t ransfer of a portion of the bacterial DNA (called T-DNA, for \"transfer DNA\") causes rapid plant cell division leading to the formation of a tumour. Scientists have taken advantage of this naturally occurring transfer mechanism, and designed DNA vectors from the tumour-inducing plasmid DNA (ti-plasmid) found in the bacteria that is capable of carrying desired genes 15 Bardor et al. 2003 . 16 Pujol et al. 2007 . 17 www.cobento.dk (July 2008 . 18 Giddings et al. 2000. 19 Mason et al. 1992. 20 Schlappi and Hohn 1992. 21 Klein et al. 1992. into the plant. The engineered or constructed genes are inserted into the Agrobacterium vectors and enter the plant by the bacteria's own internal transfer mechanisms. For Agrobacterium to transfer part of its DNA into plants, living, wounded plant tissue is usually inoculated with the bacterium.A fter culturingt he bacteria with thep lant tissues, antibioticsa re supplied, eliminating the bacterium from the plant tissue. Particle bombardment, also referred to as the biolistic system, is a physical method for DNA delivery (illustrated in table 2.3). For this method, DNA is coated onto small (<1 \u00b5m), for example gold particles, which are accelerated towards the target plant tissues. The tissue could for example be a plant callus or leave discs. A plant cell callus consists of somaticu ndifferentiated cells from an adult plant that has the ability to differentiate. The bombardment devices use a sudden release of compressed helium gas to accelerate the DNA-coated particles. After the particles pass through the plant cell wall, they enter the cytoplasm and preferably the nucleus, where the DNA comes off the particles and integrates into the genome. Depending on the host species, several physical and biological parameters have to be adapted to achieve transformation. Physical parameters include the nature, chemical, and physical properties of the particles; the nature, preparation, 2.2 Plants as a production platform for recombinant biopharmaceuticals \ue042 \ue042 and binding of DNA onto the particles; and the characteristics of the target tissue. Biological factors include choice and nature of explants, pre-and post-bombardment culture conditions, and interactions between the introduced DNA and cytoplasmic or nuclear components. After the bombardment transformed cells have to be screened. Based on the number of bombarded explants, the overall transformation frequency can be for example as high as 15 percent with germline transformation frequencies approximating 0.25 percent 23 . The screening and testing for successful integration and expression of new DNA is performed by molecular techniques, such as a using tandem selectable gene markers or molecular analysis methods such as northern blots. Selected single cells from the callus or leave disc can be treated with a series of plant hormones, such as auxins and gibberellins, which are capable to induce the re-differentiation into entire plants. This capability of total re-generation is called totipotency. The new plant that originated from a successfully shot cell may have new genetic (heritable) traits. Their ability to segregate in a Mendelian fashion in the next generations is tested in the next step. Then the families that express the transgene in the desired manner are screened.",

Some selected monocotyledons (i.e. grasses) can also be transformed by Agrobacterium, but in most monocotyledons particle bombardment is the preferred method. This is the case for cereals, such as rice, wheat, and maize, but also for soybean and other legumes 26 .Particle bombardment is also necessary, if the target tissues are plastids, as the Agrobacterium T-DNA complex is targeted to the nucleus and therefore unsuitable for gene transfer to chloroplasts.",

In the case of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, this is because inefficient processing of the T-DNA border sequences often results in cotransfer of flanking sequences 27 . In the case of particle bombardment, superfluous DNA transfer occurs because whole plasmids are generally used to coat microprojectiles 28 . Superfluous DNA transfer is a safety as well as a regulatory issue, when the result- 23 Sanford et al. 1987; Sanford 1988. 24 Dicotyledons, or \"dicots\" are a flowering plants whose seed contains two embryonic leaves or cotyledons.

Recently, several strategies to avoid the cotransfer of flanking sequences have been developed. One example is the incorporation of the barnase gene in the construct of Agrobacterium mediated transformation 29 . This gene ensures that all plant cells that contain sequences linked to the T-DNA are killed, as barnase gene expression is lethal. The barnase gene is derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and codes for a ribonuclease. In cases where flanking regions have undeliberatly incorporated into the genome of the plant, the barnase ribonuclease is synthesized. After activation the ribonuclease destroys the vital RNA molecules of the plant cell and is therefore lethal. By the addition of the barnase gene 29 Beals and Goldberg 1997; Kuvshinov et al. 2004. 2.2 Plants as a production platform for recombinant biopharmaceuticals Table 2 .3: Particle bombardment mediated transformation of plants Gene Gun: When the fire switch on the outside of the chamber, helium is released at high pressure.

Attached to the front of that disk are particles 1 micron in diameter coated with DNA molecules. This disk travels another centimeter at the speed of a gun projectile, roughly 400 meter per second, and hits a screen which detains the disk but liberates the DNA coated particles toward the target cells.",

However often in cell cultures many of these steps can be circumvented by an ingenious molecular strategy:Proteinsproduced in plant cells can remain within the cell or are secreted into the apoplast via the secretory pathway. Foreign proteins are generally not directed for secretion but can be added with a small piece of signal sequence that initiates their secretion. In plant cell cultures an excretion of the recombinant protein to the culture medium can be achieved by this strategy 47 . The biopharmaceutical can than be harvested directly from the culture medium and purification to remove the host cell proteins and nucleic acids is not required. Thus protein purification from whole plant biomass is potentially much more difficult and expensive than protein recovery from culture medium and protein secretion is considered an advantage in plant cell culture systems. However not all biopharmaceuticals are suitable for protein excretion since i.e. their stability after secretion in the culture medium can not always be ensured. Also the size of the protein might be crucial: Secre-27 tion of recombinant proteins into the medium requires that they pass pores in the cell wall of the plant cell. The pores in plant cell walls are thought to allow passage of proteins of maximum size around 20 kDa. However a small number of wider pores may serve as channels for relatively slow secretion of larger molecules. Also protein composition and structure may affect the extracellular availability of recombinant protein: in many expression systems it has been described that despite an appropriate signal sequence an considerable amount of foreign protein remain within the plant cell or remain associated with the plant cell wall 48 . Depending on the recombinant protein plant cell cultures and hairy root cultures can also differ in their ability to secrete the recombinant protein, which could mean that the one or the other system is the preferable choice.",

Techniques for avian transgenesis are less well-developed.

Two years later, Jaenisch reported that mouse embryos could be infected with a retrovirus which stably integrated the proviral DNA into their genome. These animals incorporated the retroviral DNA into their somatic tissues and germ line and passed it on to their progeny in Mendelian fashion. Since then, transgenic animals have proved to be valuable research tools and are gradually finding practical applications, for example as models of human disease, in xenotransplantation and animal pharming. The term 'transgenic' is now generally used not only to describe animals bearing additional exogenous DNA, such as an expression construct, but also those carrying other forms of engineered genetic change, such as gene replacement, deletion, inactivation or alteration.

However, it is at present limited to transgene addition and allows no control over where the transgene integrates into the genome. Definitive analysis of the integrated transgene must be carried out in resultant animals, which in livestock is costly and restricts the number of independent integrations that can feasibly be generated and investigated. The various methods of cell-mediated transgenesis each have in common the feature that genetic manipulation and analysis of the transgenic genotype is carried out in cells in the laboratory, rather than in animals \"on the farm\". These cells are then used to transfer the modified genotype to whole animals. While cell-mediated transgenesis is more labour intensive than direct transgenesis, in vitro genetic manipulation of cells followed by detailed genome analysis offers significant advantages. Firstly, it reduces the total number of animals required to generate a useful transgenic. Secondly, it increases dramatically the number of independent transgene integration events that can be screened and investigated. Thirdly, it facilitates the engineering of precisely controlled genetic alterations (gene targeting) by allowing selection and isolation of rare integration events resulting from homologous recombination (see section 2.3.2.4).",

However, this is frequently impractical in livestock because gestation times are longer and maintenance costs far higher. There has therefore been a strong incentive to reduce the number of animals gestating non-transgenic foetuses. One approach has been to screen embryos for the presence of a transgene before transfer. This can be achieved by extracting a portion of the embryo, often a single blastomere, and detecting the transgene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. This procedure is however labour-intensive, can reduce embryo viability, and the presence of non-integrated DNA may result in false positives. Alternatively, a gene encoding a non-toxic fluorescent protein can be either co-injected, or incorporated into the transgene construct to identify intact living transgenic embryos. However, expression of a non-integrated reporter construct may again produce a false positive signal, and the presence of additional DNA may be undesirable.",

Each viral particle is approximately 100nm in diameter and consists of a protein \"capsid\" containing a genome of two single-stranded 8-11kb RNA molecules, surrounded by a lipid envelope through which glycoprotein spikes protrude. Retroviruses infect their hosts by binding the spike proteins to specific receptors on the cell surface. The virus enters the cell, converts the RNA genome into DNA and this integrates randomly into a host chromosome as a provirus. The transcriptional apparatus of the host cell is subverted to produce RNA from the provirus. Viral RNA transcripts include smaller species that encode viral protein components, and fulllength genomic RNAs that are packaged into virus particles and bud off from the cell surface.",

However, in 1996 scientists at the Salk Institute, San Diego, developed vectors based on lentiviruses. Lentiviruses are a subclass of retroviruses that include the sheep maedi-visna virus, equine infectious anaemia virus and the bovine, feline, simian and human immunodeficiency viruses. These offer two significant advantages over oncoretroviruses. Firstly, they are not subject to epigenetic inactivation in transgenic animals. This is probably because, unlike oncoretroviruses, lentiviruses are usually transmitted horizontally between individuals rather than vertically through the germ line. Host animals have, therefore, not adapted mechanisms to silence their expression. Secondly, unlike oncoretroviruses they do not require breakdown of the nuclear envelope to gain access to the host genome. Lentiviral integration can therefore occur at all stages from the unfertilized oocyte onwards, in both replicating and non-replicating cells. Lentiviruses have been used successfully in a number of mammalian species: mice, rat, pig and cattle. For further background see a review by Pfeifer 59 .",

Gene targeting in mice has been used to inactivate individual endogenous genes by insertion or deletion, replace whole genes, precisely place transgenes in the host genome, introduce subtle gene modifications and to delete megabase-size DNA fragments rendering large regions hemizygous. There are many variations and refinements of the technique, and these continue to produce a wealth of information about many aspects of mammalian biology, see review 69 . 69 Capecchi 2005. There are now several possible methods of generating mice from ES cells. The most common exploits the ability of an early embryo to incorporate exogenous ES cells. A small number of ES cells may be aggregated with a pre-morula stage embryo by co-culture in a microwell, or microinjected into the cavity of a blastocyst. Embryos containing ES cells are then transferred to the reproductive tract of recipients to complete development. Animals produced in this way are chimeric, composed of a patchwork of ES and host-derived cells. In mice, chimerism can be readily visualized by marking the ES cells and host embryos with different coat colour genotypes. Chimeras are bred to derive offspring from ES-derived germ cells.

Enucleation of zygotes has also been used but with less success. The donor nucleus is then introduced into the cytoplast by microinjection or electrofusion. Reconstructed embryos are activated to simulate fertilization, then cultured if possible to identify viable embryos and transferred to the oviduct of foster mothers to complete gestation, see figure 2.10. 75 Campbell et al. 2005; Wells 2005; Vajta and Gjerris 2006. 2.3 Animals as a production platform for recombinant biopharmaceuticals In 1986, the first viable mammal was produced by nuclear transfer, a sheep produced by fusion of a blastomere of an eight-cell embryo into an enucleated egg 76 .

If a nucleus is transferred into oocyte cytoplasm with high MPF, the nuclear envelope breaks down and chromatin undergoes chromosome condensation, followed by nuclear reformation and DNA replication. A nucleus from a cell in G1 phase of the cell cycle will undergo normal DNA replication and can support normal development. However, a donor nucleus in S, or G2 phase undergoes aberrant re-replication of DNA, causing aneuploidy or chromosomal damage and consequent failure of development. Nuclear transfer efficiency into unfertilized oocytes can therefore be improved by synchronising donor nuclei in G1. In contrast, if a nucleus is transferred to a fertilized oocyte in which MPF levels have declined, nuclear envelope breakdown does not occur and the cell cycle of an incoming nucleus in either G1, S, or G2 phase will be completed normally. MPF can also be induced to decline by experimentally activating the oocyte by exposure to ionomycin, ethanol, strontium, or by an electrical pulse and these methods have been used to produce live offspring by transfer of S or G2 nuclei.",

Subsequently Brinster and others showed that SSCs could be transferred across species. Rat SSCs could be transplanted into mouse testes and produce sperm and vice versa; hamster SSCs also produce sperm in mouse testes. More distantly related species, such as rabbit, pig, baboon, and human, also populate mouse testes, but do not complete spermatogenesis. It is possible that this barrier could be overcome by co-transplantation of sertoli cells, or testis tissue. Transfer of germ cells between livestock species is now being developed.

Many mammalian proteins require N-linked glycosylation for correct folding and stability; most bacteria are unable to do this. Plants can carry out N-linked glycosylation, but the sugars added are frequently very different to those present on mammalian proteins. Notably, plants do not add a group of sugars termed sialic acids, which frequently terminate oligosaccharide chains on glycoproteins. Glycosylation patterns also vary between mammalian species, tissue types and even between metabolic states of the same tissue. Importantly, humans differ from the majority of other mammals in the type of sialic acids present. The two principle forms are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).

As most recombinant proteins are present in the whey fraction, the first steps are removal of fat and suspended caseins by procedures that may include: centrifugation, acid or PEG precipitation or chymosin treatment and/or microfiltration. This would then be followed by a series of chromatography steps to isolate the recombinant protein away from the whey, remaining milk proteins and other contaminants. Final clean-up steps might include ultrafiltration and possibly heat treatment to prepare a pharmaceutical-grade therapeutic product. Current experience indicates a final yield of purified product of between 40-60% of the amount in milk, depending on the nature of the protein and the required purification procedure. The greatest loss tends to be during casein removal. This may be reduced by treatment with chelating agents that deform casein micelles and release associated recombinant protein.",

As described above, regular monitoring by veterinarians is required.

Concerns regarding transmission of prion diseases (BSE, scrapie) also mean that land used as animal pasture should not have had contact with other farm animals for several years. For this reason, some companies have chosen to raise animals in countries free of prion diseases, for example New Zealand. Alternatively, animals such as pigs and rabbits can be raised indoors in specific pathogen free facilities to minimize the risk of infectious diseases.

Biopharmaceuticals of all types have sometimes encountered problems meeting this strict definition, and it is considerably more difficult than for chemically produced products. It is conceivable that this will be revised in the future. With regard to purity, acceptable low levels can be set for such contaminants as pathogens, host proteins, DNA and reagents used in the purification process. However, it is more difficult to set acceptable standards for \"identity\" because very minor differences in protein glycosylation, folding and other post-translational modifications can alter bioactivity, efficacy and immunogenicity, possibly resulting in allergic or other adverse reactions in the patient.",
