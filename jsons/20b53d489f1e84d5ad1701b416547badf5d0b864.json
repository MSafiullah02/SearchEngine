Serology analysis with neutralising antibodies from the 1000 people could allow for the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections to be estimated with good accuracy. This rate could be extrapolated to the city's entire population and thus inform more precisely whether the provi sional attack rate during this period was a few cases per thousand or perhaps affected 1-2% of the population, 20%, or more. Serosurveys should be seen as polls before elections; they can be repeated several times, 3 week after week, to monitor the epidemic precisely.",
