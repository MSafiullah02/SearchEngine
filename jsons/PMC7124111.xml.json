First, the size of the \u00adfilter\u2019s pores causes the organisms to be retained on a relatively large filter surface. Second, the provision of nonlinear irregular pores determines the course of airflow and causes an increase in inertial force that traps the microorganisms within the mesh. The pore size can allow interception of organisms larger than 1 \u03bcm and thanks to the nonlinear arrangement of the pores increases their ability to filter microorganisms larger than 0.5 \u03bcm. This principle has the limitation that the mesh of tiny pores has high resistance to airflow.The electrostatic filter is produced by the fibers of the internal components of the filter being subjected to an electric field. Bacteria and viruses also have a surface electric charge, either positive or negative, and remain trapped in the dipole electric fields of the filter screen.The bactericidal filter is made by impregnating the filter material with bactericidal agents. Their action allows the growth of bacteria within the filter. For this purpose, antiseptic substances such as chlorhexidine acetate have been used. They are not recommended because they can dissolve in the condensate circuit and reach the tracheobronchial tract.\n",

Pulmonary air trapping can have different implications: (a) hemodynamic deterioration, (b) risk of pneumothorax and (c) impaired gas exchange. Pulmonary air trapping leads to increased intrathoracic pressure, which causes the venous return, and therefore can decrease cardiac output and blood pressure. One of the mechanisms of the production of pneumothorax is increased intrathoracic pressure, and this increase appears with air trapping. Moreover, this can also cause air trapping impaired gas exchange because of changes in ventilation/perfusion of the lung, and therefore lead to the development of hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. This effect could appear when the filter is interposed between the \u201cY\u201d part and the endotracheal tube or is located in the expiratory limb (immediately before the expiratory valve of the respirator).Respiratory filters produce an increase in inspiratory flow resistance, which may have implications for the patient and the respirator. This increase in inspiratory flow resistance increases the work of breathing of the patient to initiate inspiration and may hinder weaning from mechanical ventilation. Besides, this increase in inspiratory flow resistance also increases the work of breathing for inspiration, and positive pressure can damage the mechanism of the respirator. This effect can appear when the filter is interposed between the \u201cY\u201d part and the endotracheal tube or is located in the inspiratory limb (immediately after the ventilator inspiratory valve).The bacterial filters generate an increase in dead space because the air space does not participate in gas exchange and can lead to hypoventilation and the development of hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. This effect can appear when the filter is interposed between the \u201cY\u201d part and the endotracheal tube.\n",

This decrease in exogenous respiratory infection processes could be due to the fact that microbial filters in respiratory circuits could reduce the risk of exogenous microorganisms reaching the patient antegradely from the inspiratory valve of the respirator or retrogradely from the exhalation valve of the respirator.",

In 1981, Feeley et al. [12] studied 293 anesthetized patients, a group with a filter circuit in the inspiratory limb and one without filters, and no differences in the cumulative incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia between the two groups (2.2% vs. 2.5%) was found. In one study carried out by our team, 230 critically ill patients were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with and without respiratory filters. We did not find significant differences between patients with and without respiratory filters in the percentage of patients who developed VAP (24.56% vs. 21.55%), in the incidence of VAP per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation (17.41 vs. 16.26 without BF) or in the incidence of exogenous VAP per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation (2.40 vs. 1.74) [13].",
