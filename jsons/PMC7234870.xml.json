            "text": "Recently, journalist Amanda Marcotte (2020) shared a disturbing story: \u2018a train engineer named Eduardo Moreno, apparently with great deliberation, derailed the freight train he was manning in Southern California, nearly killing occupants of three nearby cars. His target? The USNS Mercy, a Navy medical ship that\u2019s been assisting nearby hospitals with COVID-19 patients.\u2019 The rationale given by the train engineer is enough to cause even the most reserved introvert to spit fire. Marcotte elaborates: \u2018Apparently, Moreno believes in a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus crisis is a hoax being deployed to cover for a shadowy takeover of the government.\u2019 Will Sommer (2020) reported on an Illinois woman inspired by pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory videos who traveled to New York City armed with more than a dozen knives and who intended to kill former Vice President Joe Biden. She tried to get near to the US Navy Hospital Ship Comfort, the hospital ship that was sent to New York City to help with the coronavirus pandemic, but mistook the Comfort for the USS Intrepid, a \u2018retired\u2019 aircraft carrier. Like many QAnon believers, she had become obsessed with the Comfort, convinced that it\u2019s being used to rescue \u2018mole children\u2019 from the clutches of liberal elites who enjoy sodomizing and then cannibalizing young children. Some of these same conspiracy theorists believe that children are being held hostage in secret tunnels beneath city streets by liberal democrats to be used in rituals designed to conjure Satan. A vigilant Trump was apparently onto them in a thrice and is preparing to bring the evil doers to justice.",

But there is another type of insanity, the one that attempts to separate the rich and the poor and then pretends that such a separation does not exist. Trump and the conspiracy theorists belong in this camp, too. The whistle-a-happy-tune-happy-talk-keep talkin\u2019-happy-talk cover up that paints the gross economic inequalities that mark disaster capitalism to be as normal as a spring day with chirping birds has been rent asunder by the coronavirus. Amidst the ideological debris being flung about\u2014from both the right and the left\u2014in the daily online philippics against the deep state, what is not being engaged nearly enough, i.e., what needs a wider and more critical expansion of understanding, is the effect that the coronavirus is having on the powerless and the poor throughout the capitalist world. Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research warns:Madness engulfs the planet. Hundreds of millions of people are in lockdown in their homes, millions of people who work in essential jobs \u2013 or who cannot afford to stay home without state assistance \u2013 continue to go to work, thousands of people lie in intensive-care beds taken care of by tens of thousands of medical professionals and caregivers who face shortages of equipment and time. Narrow sections of the human population \u2013 the billionaires \u2013 believe that they can isolate themselves in their enclaves, but the virus knows no borders. (Tricontinental 2020)",

But it will not be life as usual. It will be life in an updated, refurbished postdigital panopticon (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018; Peters 2020). During the pandemic, Devega (2020) predicts that \u2018many people will embrace being monitored and tracked.

From the time that the coronavirus crisis first appeared on the shores of God\u2019s favorite piece of real estate, it became clear that it is comorbid with Christian nationalism; or to put it another way, Christian nationalism seems to be a co-occurring condition relative to pandemics that reach the shores of America the Beautiful (McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020a). Some religious scholars, in fact, are in agreement that there is a two-way relationship between religion and nationalism, a mutual reification and buttressing. As Grzymala-Busse (2019) explains:[i]n this relationship, religiosity defines the nation\u2014and nationalism reinforces religiosity, leading to unusually high rates of national identification with a given religion and high rates of religiosity itself. This mutual reinforcement characterizes countries where religious participation and religious nationalism are both high, such as the Philippines, Poland, Ireland until the late 1990s, or the United States.

But it is increasingly clear that Trump has identified himself with charismatic, Pentecostal, and evangelical Christianity, largely for political reasons\u2014their practitioners perceive him as a divine instrument of God and are prevalent in key states important for Trump\u2019s reelection chances. I am largely against religious states in principle, and have said so when speaking in Israel, or Pakistan, or the West Bank (Palestine). I have always supported freedom of religion within a secular state apparatus open to a wide range of religious faiths. And I have always defended \u2018the separation of church and state\u2019 (Thomas Jefferson\u2019s phrase) in articulating my understanding of the intent and function of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which reads: \u2018Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\u2019 (see McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020b). Ignoring the Constitution, those who have helped to manufacture the virus of Christian nationalism boast no need of critical sobriety and less need for metropolitan intellectuals with their incessant insistence on finding new ways to clamp down on what they see as the necessary separation of church and state. Christian nationalism is a sickness that poisons every ethico-political reservoir of hope and possibility with a fatal hubris. For decades, the messages of prosperity preachers have hollowed into my mind, sometimes in the form of a revolving worm announced by a roll of thundering apocalyptic prose and on other occasions like a flaming corpse decamped from the grave of undiscovered history. And in my most paranoid moments, they take the shape of unclean spirits shooting like roman candles from some pungent, weed-strewn sepulcher right out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.",

Belonging, or affiliation, is a much weaker connection: it may simply consist of self-identification or a nominal belonging to a given religion.Grzymala-Busse (2019) elaborates that \u2018where nationalism seeks political recognition and sovereignty for the nation, religious nationalism does so for a nation first and foremost defined by religion.\u2019 She also points out correctly that \u2018referents of religion are the sacred and the transcendental: nations are fundamentally mundane and political.\u2019 And I fully agree with the observation that \u2018[w]hether religion and nation replace, reconcile with, or reinforce each other, they are conceptually and empirically distinct.\u2019",

And once Trump was elected, reshuffled the government, and began to communicate through Twitter, the tribal conditions were set in place. Twitter for Trump is equivalent to the microphone at the lectionary of a church. From here he can dictate the catechism for the day\u2019s events. The compatibility and mutual buttressing between the secular state and the evangelical community redound to the Trump administration, solidifying his Christian base while accentuating the chasm between the illegitimate state and the \u2018true\u2019 religious calling of the country to bring freedom to all nations of the world, whether this includes imposing sanctions or bombing those countries back to the Stone Age. The Hebraic idea of people enjoying a special covenant with God has had an impact on Northern Irish, Afrikaner, and Israeli nationalism\u2014and also on US nationalism (Grzymala-Busse 2019). The narratives of nations as divinely \u2018chosen people\u2019 have merged religious and national identities in these countries, and I would say that Trump\u2019s moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem certainly has secured the gratitude of many Israelis and Christians who believe that this action brings the world one step closer to Armageddon and the coming of the Messiah\u2014for Christians this would mean that Jesus would establish the Kingdom of God on earth and \u2018true\u2019 Christians who had repented their sins would receive heaven as their reward.

The cult\u2019s warped calculus is basically this: Trump will only be re-elected with a prospering economy, but if COVID-19 decimates the economy, Trump could lose. So we have to save the economy, literally at any cost, even if it means we have to sacrifice older Americans (who typically vote Republican). (Cesca 2020)Trump\u2019s evangelical base seems to be adhering to their master\u2019s logic. And besides, Kathaleen Wall, a member of the Texas State Republican Executive Committee and a candidate for Texas\u2019 22nd Congressional District, is euphoric that the coronavirus has a silver lining: it\u2019s going to save more people than it kills this week\u2014because abortion clinics in the state of Texas have been closed (Chapman 2020a). I am certain most of Trump\u2019s salvation corps would agree.

He then made this claim at least three more times a few days later.\u2018Now, the virus that we\u2019re talking about having to do \u2015 you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat \u2015 as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We\u2019re in great shape though. We have 12 cases \u2015 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.\u2019 [Feb. 10]\u2018Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\u2019 [Feb. 10]\u2018I really believe they are going to have it under control fairly soon. You know in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. And that\u2019s a beautiful date to look forward to.\u2019 [Feb. 10]\u2018We think and we hope, based on all signs that the problem goes away in April.\u2019 [Feb. 13]\u2018There\u2019s a theory that, in April, when it gets warm \u2015 historically, that has been able to kill the virus. So we don\u2019t know yet; we\u2019re not sure yet.\u2019 [Feb. 14]\u2018I think it\u2019s going to work out fine. I think when we get into April, in the warmer weather, that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus.\u2019 [Feb. 14]On Feb. 10, there were 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. Now there are nearly 200,000. And on Tuesday, the death toll in the U.S. surpassed 3,000, making the virus more deadly than the 9/11 terrorist attacks that reshaped much of American life. Who knows how many people will have died as the result of the coronavirus by the time this article sees print? (Terkel 2020)",

In other words, needs are contextually specific; they are contingent upon the situation at hand (i.e., mode of production, geopolitics, existential challenges). So that contingency and necessity have to be understood dialectically, not as \u2018either/or\u2019 but as \u2018both/and.\u2019 All things are relative to the necessity that produces them. Yet evangelical preachers declaim messianically that humankind is universally born of the spirit and propagate the falsehood that contingent phenomena such as the coronavirus are in reality divine plagues cast upon humankind for the sin of homosexuality, abortion, fornication, political correctness, and multiculturalism. In this way, for evangelicals, faith in the transcendent supernatural power of Jesus must supersede science. Humans are perceived as powerless if they decline to pray to the God of Prosperity. Here science is glibly supplanted by a metaphysical abstraction. But prayer should not be done in the spirit of helplessness.

This is not prophecy television gobbledygook speech. I remain committed to an historical materialist analysis of capitalism and still, at the same time, consider it possible that prayer may have some effects that cannot be explained by traditional paradigms of science (see McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020b). But during a pandemic, prayer should not be a substitute for medical research. And prayer circles cannot replace medical treatment. And religious bullshit cannot take the place of rational adjudication and dialectical reasoning.",

I\u2019m sure they will encourage you to pull up a chair. Attend a Sunday service by Dr. William J. Barber, II, co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. You can still accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior without at the same time blaming the filthy commies from waging a war against Christianity through their advocacy of multiculturalism, feminism, LGBTQ rights, bilingual education, and democratic socialism. Well, the list goes on. Liberation theology advocates a preferential option for the poor and its exponents and practitioners have stood beside peasant resistance movements in Latin America, even as US trained and sponsored death squads of the Salvadorean military and police forces assassinated many of their leaders, including six Jesuits, their housekeeper, and her daughter in 1979 in their residence on the campus of the Jesuit Central American University (UCA) in San Salvador, El Salvador. The death squads also participated in the assassination of Archbishop \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero, the \u2018voice of those without voice,\u2019 who was gunned down saying mass at Hospital de la Divina Providencia, a Catholic hospital specializing in oncology and care for the terminally ill. Liberation theology has learned from the writings of Karl Marx without abandoning the teachings of Jesus, teachings which condemn differentiating wealth\u2014the egregious reality that some people are rich at the expense of others who are poor. You can learn, too. Check your local library. Better still, visit some base communities in America Latina.",
