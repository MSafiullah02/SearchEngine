Within this broad category, death can be directly attributed to an injury received during the activity in which case the manner of death is best certified as an \"accident\" provided that the trauma was received in accordance with the rules of the sport. In the case of death due to trauma inflicted flagrantly outside of the rules of the sport or if the lethal injury was intentionally inflicted, a manner certification of \"homicide\" may be more appropriate. In many cases, sudden death may be the result of physical stress superimposed upon a natural disease process or pathologic condition, often involving the heart. In this setting, the manner of death should be certified \"natural,\" analogous to myocardial infarction occurring in an older person engaged in physical exertion (Froede 2003) .",

While the manifestation of repeated concussions usually appears in middle age or later, it is probable that the damage begins when the brain is first jarred with resultant alteration in mental status that is characteristic of a concussion. What is certain is that concussions must be treated as a serious medical condition, and vigilance is necessary to ensure the safety of participants who are in a post-concussive state. The clinical entity known as the \"second impact syndrome\" (SIS) can cause morbidity and mortality following head injury (Bey and Ostick 2009) . SIS is comprised of two events: (1) a concussive head injury and (2) a second head injury within several weeks followed by cerebral edema, herniation, and death. Although the incidence is arguable and is yet to be firmly established, it is thought to be a rare outcome of head injury (Bey and Ostick 2009) . In any event, any athlete who manifests concussive symptoms following a head injury (e.g., fatigue, confusion, headache, nausea, vomiting) should be closely observed and not be permitted to return to play for 7-14 days (Bey and Ostick 2009) (Table 26 .1).",

Cerebral contusions may also occur at the fracture site. These types of injuries are surgical emergencies.

In contradistinction to the cerebral contusions and/or fractures directly subjacent to the site of impact of a moving object with a stationary head, deceleration injuries may be associated with contrecoup cerebral contusions. These lesions are located opposite to the site of impact of a moving head with a stationary surface. Common locations for contrecoup cerebral contusions are the inferior aspects of the frontal lobes and the anterior temporal lobes. Contrecoup contusions may or may not be accompanied by basilar skull fractures. Rapid deceleration of the cranial contents can also result in diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the white matter and intracranial hemorrhage. Subdural hematomas (SDH) secondary to venous bleeding following rapid deceleration of the head can result in a potentially lethal increase in intracranial pressure that must be aggressively managed.",

In the absence of a witnessed seizure, other causes of death must be excluded prior to attributing death to epilepsy. Further, intracranial trauma must be excluded as a cause of the seizure. Some epileptics will die suddenly and unexpectedly in the absence of a seizure (sudden unexpected death in an epileptic person or SUDEP), but this does not typically occur while the victim is engaged in sports. The autopsy may or, more commonly, may not identify the anatomic correlate of the seizure focus in the brain.",

Young people more often have type I diabetes and may be insulin dependent. As teens have a tendency toward denial and risk-taking behavior, they may not be fully compliant with their treatment regimens and therefore be prone to significant blood glucose fluxes. The gross findings at autopsy will be minimal in these cases. Microscopically, the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas may be infiltrated by lymphocytes (\"insulitis\"), or they may be diminished in number. Urine screens for glucose and ketones may be useful, but postmortem blood analysis is unreliable. The best sample for diagnosing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis postmortem is vitreous humor. The presence of ketones and significantly elevated glucose (> 500 mg/dL) in the vitreous humor is diagnostic of this condition (Chansky et al. 2009 ). Vitreous glucose levels drop significantly after death, however, so a lower ocular glucose level does not exclude hyperglycemia. Further, hypoglycemia cannot be diagnosed postmortem due to the aforementioned postmortem change. In the evaluation of a nontraumatic death occurring during sports, analysis of vitreous glucose, ketones, and electrolyte levels is recommended in all cases.",
