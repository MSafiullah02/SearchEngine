Although this is a new strain, related coronaviruses can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and MERS.1\n",

No language restrictions were applied. The search terms are described in the supplementary file. Three of the authors (LM, IH, and NW), working in pairs, independently screened records, abstracts, and full text articles. Two authors extracted data (LM and NW). When consensus was lacking, a third reviewer was consulted (SK). The reference lists of selected retrieved papers were screened to identify additional studies that met inclusion criteria. To locate the most recent papers on covid-19, we also searched medRxiv, an online archive and distribution server, for complete but unpublished manuscripts (preprints) in the medical and health sciences.",

This is the highest possible rating for a non-randomised study.10 Results for the two continuous outcomes showed high heterogeneity, which is why we have emphasised the dichotomous results where the I2 score was low. Finally, we were only able to test for publication bias in the two outcomes that had 10 or more studies.",
