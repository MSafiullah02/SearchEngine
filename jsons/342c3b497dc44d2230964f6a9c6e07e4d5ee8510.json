Although the majority of COVID-19 patients experience only mild or 31 moderate symptoms, a subset will progress to severe disease with pneumonia and acute 32 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation 2 . Emerging results 33 indicate a dysregulated immune response characterized by runaway inflammation, 34 including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as the major driver of pathology in severe 35 COVID-19 3,4 . With no treatments currently approved for COVID-19, therapeutics to 36 prevent or treat the excessive inflammation in severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 37 infection are urgently needed. Here, in 10 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients we 38 report profound elevation of plasma IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), decreased CD8+ T cell 39 levels, and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Following compassionate care treatment with 40 the CCR5 blocking antibody leronlimab, we observed complete CCR5 receptor 41 occupancy on macrophage and T cells, rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the 42 CD4/CD8 ratio, and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Consistent 43 with reduction of plasma IL-6, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed declines in 44 transcriptomic myeloid cell clusters expressing IL-6 and interferon-related genes. These 45 results demonstrate a novel approach to resolving unchecked inflammation, restoring 46 immunologic deficiencies, and reducing SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load via disruption of 47 the CCL5-CCR5 axis, and support randomized clinical trials to assess clinical efficacy of 48 leronlimab-mediated inhibition of CCR5 for COVID-19. 49 50",
