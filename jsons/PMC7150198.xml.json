Of course, biological warfare does encompass such activity, but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane. Ever since life evolved on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago, organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other. Any organism that makes use of toxins\u2014from bacteria to snakes\u2014is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms.",

While humanity finds antibiotics incredibly useful in our battle against infectious disease, bacteria did not create them for our benefit. Instead, they make antibiotics to kill off other bacteria that are competing for the same habitat or resources. Similarly, bacteria synthesize toxic proteins known as bacteriocins to kill their relatives because closely related strains of bacteria are likelier to compete with each other. For example, many strains of Escherichia coli deploy a wide variety of bacteriocins (referred to as colicins) intended to kill other strains of E. coli. The genes for colicins are normally carried on plasmids, and many of these plasmids are commonly used in molecular biology and genetic engineering (see Chapter 3). Yersinia pestis, the plague bacterium, also makes bacteriocins (called pesticins in this case) designed to kill competing strains of its own species (Fig. 22.1\n).",

Bacteria deploy bacteriocins against their fellow\u2014often closely related\u2014bacteria with the deliberate intention of killing them. In contrast, proteins produced by bacteria that act against higher organisms are referred to as toxins. Perhaps counterintuitively, pathogenic bacteria do not usually \u201cintend\u201d to kill the organisms they infect. Rather, they want to manipulate them long enough to survive and reproduce. The longer the host stays alive, the longer it provides a home for the infecting bacteria. Just like antibiotics, some bacterial toxins are useful to humans. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces an insect-killing toxin that is harmless to vertebrates, and this \u201cBt toxin\u201d has been used extensively in genetically modified crops.

Siderophores are excreted, bind iron, and are then taken back into bacteria by specialized transport systems. Absence of high-potency siderophores largely abolishes virulence in both plague and tuberculosis. Because mammals do not make siderophores, their unique biosynthetic pathways provide an attractive target for development of novel antibiotics. Yersiniabactin, the siderophore of several pathogenic Yersinia species, is capped by a salicyl group (Fig. 22.4\n).",

It would be far cheaper to genetically engineer nonpathogenic strains of E. coli to express the mannose derivatives on their cell surfaces. Pathogenic bacteria would then bind to these decoys instead of to mammalian cells.

Because several properly functioning binding subunits are required to deliver the active subunit, one approach to antitoxin therapy relies on utilizing dominant-negative mutations in the binding subunit of the toxin. The mechanism involves the binding of a defective protein subunit to functional subunits resulting in a complex that is inactive overall. (The term dominant-negative refers to mutations in which an abnormal gene product sabotages the activity of the wild-type gene product. Consequently, most dominant-negative mutations affect proteins with multiple subunits.) Dominant-negative mutations have been deliberately isolated in the B protein (called the \u201cprotective antigen\u201d) of anthrax toxin. Mixing mutant subunits with wild-type ones resulted in the assembly of inactive heptamers that bind the A subunits (called \u201clethal factor\u201d and \u201cedema factor\u201d) of anthrax toxin. As a result, the toxic A subunits cannot be transported into target cells (Fig. 22.8\n).

It is highly infectious and generally regarded as an incapacitating agent.\u25a0\nBurkholderia pseudomallei.\nMelioidosis is related to glanders (Burkholderia mallei), a disease of horses. Melioidosis is a rare disease of rodents from the Far East that is spread by rat fleas. Melioidosis is more virulent than glanders and, untreated, is fatal some 95% of the time in humans.\nIn many ways, anthrax is one of the best biological weapons. It is lethal, highly infectious, and easy to produce, and it has long-lasting spores. Plague is also lethal, and its pneumonic form can spread from person to person.

Ebola and Marburg viruses make up a family of negative single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses, known as the Filoviruses, which form long, thin filaments (Fig. 22.20\n). Patients vomit and ooze blood from various orifices, including their eyes and ears. Ebola outbreaks in Sudan and Zaire have had 80% to 90% fatality, but closely related strains exist that are not as virulent. For example, in 1989, an Ebola outbreak occurred among long-tailed macaques in a research facility in Reston, Virginia. However, this strain was not lethal to humans. Transmission generally requires substantial exposure to infected body fluids, so filoviruses are difficult to acquire by casual exposure. In practice, this makes them a relatively poor choice for use as a biological warfare agent.\u25a0\nFlavivirus. Dengue fever and yellow fever are both caused by members of the Flavivirus family. Yellow fever is frequently lethal, whereas dengue is rarely fatal, but it is very painful and incapacitates its victims for several days. However, both are spread by insect bites, which would make their use as biological weapons difficult.\u25a0\nArenavirus. An Arenavirus that appeared in the Lassa River region of Nigeria in the late 1960s causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever, which symptomatically resembles an Ebola infection. This segmented ssRNA virus has extremely high mortality and is typically spread by rodents.\nSmallpox is the most likely virus to be used as a biological warfare agent. It is highly infectious, and the death rate may reach 30% to 40%. Other viruses with higher mortality rates may be prohibitively difficult to distribute.\n",

Alternatively, seeds could be infected, especially since many of them are imported to the United States and may be more easily accessed for contamination.

Any virus containing a poison sequence, a base sequence that is not stably maintained on bacterial plasmids, could perhaps be cloned as separate fragments. Such a strategy works for yellow fever virus, but a complete, functional cDNA requires ligation of the fragments in vitro.",
