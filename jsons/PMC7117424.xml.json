            "text": "The tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, including regulating the innate immune response against viruses (Heikel et al., 2016). Immediately after a viral infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), thereby allowing cells to distinguish self from non-self and activate an immune response (Sparrer and Gack, 2015). For RNA viruses, the main cytoplasmic PRR is retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene I (RIG-I), which can directly recognize and bind viral 5\u2032-PPP RNA and short double-stranded RNA (Chan and Gack, 2016). After recognition, the N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I are modified by ubiquitin which is mediated by TRIM25. Such modification is essential for activating a signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in the transcriptional activation of type I and III interferons (IFNs), mediating viral clearance, and inhibiting viral replication and spread (Gack et al., 2009; Martin-Vicente et al., 2017). Various viruses are inhibited by TRIM25, e.g., Coxsackie B virus and poliovirus (Schoggins et al., 2014).",

ORF1a and ORF1b encode two large nonstructural polyproteins, ppla and pplb, which are processed into at least 14 nonstructural proteins (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Ziebuhr et al., 2000). ORF2a\u2013ORF7 encode structural proteins, including four membrane-associated glycoproteins (GP2a, GP3, GP4, and GP5), three unglycosylated membrane proteins (E, ORF5a, and M), and a nucleocapsid protein (N) (Dea et al., 2000; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Among these, nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp11, and N, have been identified and characterized as IFN antagonists (Lunney et al., 2016). Further, the N protein is the most abundant protein during infection, accounting for approximately 40% of virion proteins (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). It plays essential roles in the virus life cycle, including encapsidation of viral RNA (Spilman et al., 2009). Currently, it is only known that N protein suppresses IFN-\u03b2 induction by antagonizing IRF3 activation (Sagong and Lee, 2011). However, other mechanisms through which N protein inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production are not clear. The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) inhibits type I IFN production by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination (Hu et al., 2017). Whereas PRRSV and SARS both belong to the Nidovirales order, whether PRRSV N protein inhibits the host innate immune response by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination is not clear.",

When RIG-I-HA and TRIM25-Myc were co-transfected with N-Flag, the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I was markedly diminished. Meanwhile, when TRIM25-Myc and RIG-I-HA were co-transfected without N-Flag, the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I was not affected (Fig. 4C).

Previously, many host factors that result in cellular resistance to PRRSV via different mechanisms were identified (Li et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018, 2017). For example, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase protects against PRRSV infection by converting cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol, which can be used as a natural antiviral agent to combat PRRSV infection (Song et al., 2017). Further, galectin-3 inhibits replication PRRSV by interacting with viral Nsp12 in vitro (Li et al., 2018). In the current study, using Marc-145 cells, we demonstrated that the overexpression of TRIM25 restricts the replication of PRRSV, whereas knocking down this protein promotes the replication of PRRSV (Fig. 1). Therefore, TRIM25 acts as a novel host factor that inhibits the replication of PRRSV.",

            "text": "TRIM25 can activate the host innate immune system and simultaneously induce a series of antiviral responses by promoting the ubiquitination of RIG-I and activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. However, in the course of natural infection, PRRSV can complete the replication cycle and efficiently spread. Hence, PRRSV has evolved several general strategies to evade the innate immune response. It has been reported that some viral proteins interact with TRIM25 and inhibit RIG-I activation. For example, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus interacts with the CC domain of TRIM25 preventing its dimerization and the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I CARDs, thereby suppressing RIG-I signal transduction (Gack et al., 2009). Further, TRIM25 interacts with the N protein of SARS-CoV, thereby inhibiting the activation of RIG-I (Hu et al., 2017). In the current study, we found that the N protein of PRRSV inhibits the ubiquitination of RIG-I by competitively interfering with the interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25. This might be the mechanism through which PRRSV inhibits the antiviral effect of TRIM25. Furthermore, TRIM25 levels decreased when the cells were infected with PRRSV. In addition, when plasmids expressing TRIM25 and the N protein of PRRSV were co-transfected into cells, the expression of TRIM25 was significantly suppressed. Based on this, it would be difficult for TRIM25 to exert an anti-viral effect upon PRRSV infection. This might represent another mechanism through which PRRSV antagonizes the antiviral response of TRIM25. Besides, the N protein of PEDV, another coronavirus, is also able to antagonize IFN-\u03b2 production(Ding et al., 2014). Since PRRSV, SARS, and PEDV all belong to Nidovirales, we speculate that the respective N proteins may exert a similar effect of inhibiting TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I. However, the effect of PEDV N protein on the inhibition of RIG-I ubiquitination requires further research.",
