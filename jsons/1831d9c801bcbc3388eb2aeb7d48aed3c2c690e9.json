The recent interest in this subspeciality is reflected by an increasing number of practicing foot and ankle specialists, focused, national and international conferences, workshops, courses, regional networks and publications related to the foot and ankle conditions. To showcase the importance of foot and ankle disorders, we have included several high-quality reviews and original research articles, annotations, along with some very interesting case reports and technical tips. The variety of publications, in this special issue, range from fractures (4, 5) , arthritis (6), diabetic foot problems (7, 8 ) , tendon transfer for the foot drop (9), hallux valgus, club foot and Morton's neuroma. There are also articles on ultrasoundguided regional anaesthesia in foot and ankle surgery and on postoperative rehabilitation (10, 11).",
