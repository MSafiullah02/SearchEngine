A novel coronavirus named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of SARS [2]. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV consists of 422 amino acids and shares 20\u201330% homology with N proteins of other coronaviruses [3]. The N protein is the major antigen recognized by convalescent antisera and can be used as a diagnostic marker for the detection of SARS [4]. The N protein is reported to be phosphorylated [5] and the phosphorylation plays a role in the immunoreactivity and specificity of SARS-CoV N protein [6].",

B23 protein can bind nucleic acids [18] and physically interact with maturing preribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles [19]. This protein also functions as a shuttle protein in protein nuclear import [20], [21]. It is reported that B23 protein forms a specific complex with several viral proteins such as Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus [22], Rev protein [23], and Tat protein [24] of human immunodeficiency virus and Hepatitis delta virus antigens [25]. B23 protein is also identified as one of the substrates of CDK2/cyclin E and plays a critical role in centrosome duplication during cell cycle progression, which is regulated by the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199 [26], [27]. Furthermore, B23 protein possesses molecular chaperoning activities, including preventing protein aggregation, protecting enzymes during thermal denaturation, and facilitating renaturation of chemically denatured proteins [28].",

Therefore, we studied the interaction of these two proteins and the functional effect of this interaction. We discovered that B23 interacted with SARS-CoV N protein in vitro and in vivo. Somewhat surprisingly, we mapped the B23-binding domain within the N protein to a SR-rich domain (aa 175\u2013210) rather than any putative NLS motif. B23 usually plays a role in nuclear import of the viral proteins to which it binds [24], [25]. However, according to our previous study [10], the deletion mutant N4 (175\u2013422), which could interact with B23 protein, was shown to localize in cytoplasm and the deletion mutant N1 (1\u2013225), which also could interact with B23 protein, localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Moreover, overexpression of B23 protein in HeLa cells did not change the cytoplasmic localization of N protein of SARS-CoV (data not shown).

            "text": "B23 protein is also identified as one of the substrates of CDK2/cyclin E and plays a role in centrosome duplication during cell cycle progression. B23 associates specifically with unduplicated centrosomes and this association is controlled by CDK2\u2013cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation. B23 loses its affinity to centrosomes in its phosphorylated form. Dissociation of the centrosomal B23 is essential for the centrosome to initiate duplication [26]. The Thr199 amino acid in B23 is the phosphorylation site essential in this regulation of centrosome duplication [27]. In our previous research, we have shown that the N protein of SARS-CoV can arrest cell cycle progression [10], which is in accordance with the result of Surjit et al. [11]. Here we demonstrated that N protein inhibited the phosphorylation of B23 at Thr199 in HeLa cells and in in vitro phosphorylation assay (Fig. 4). Therefore, we hypothesize that when N protein interacts with B23, N protein may competitively inhibit the interaction of B23 and CDK2 kinase or the phosphorylation site of B23 may be masked by the bound N protein, resulting in lack of phosphorylation of B23 protein. This can lead to cell cycle arresting since the centrosome can not initiate duplication. In this model, the N protein of SARS-CoV manipulates the host cell cycle machinery by acting as a competitive inhibitor to B23 phosphorylation through its interaction with B23 protein.",
