            "text": "Many formal methods research communities lack a shared set of benchmarks. As a result, many research articles in the past have evaluated new techniques on specifications that are specifically tailored to the problem or not publicly available. While this is great for proving the concept in question, it does not offer any insights on how it performs on real-world examples. Additionally, with machine learning techniques gaining more popularity, a larger set of public specifications is required. In this paper, we present our public set of B machines and urge contribution. As we think this to be an issue in other communities in scope of the ABZ as well, we are also interested in specifications expressed in other formalisms, for example Alloy, TLA + or Z.",

Other use cases, such as data validation [7] work by executing a model along one particular, linear path, while others, like constraint solving problems, sometimes work on machines without variables, consisting of a single state. Most recently, machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to model checking or synthesis as well, and require a large number of specifications, e.g., in order to extract and re-combine predicates [6] . Even with access to numerous machines, it is time-consuming and cumbersome to identify machines to use for benchmarking, especially since only a small amount of data can be presented in a typical research article. Without any doubt, other research groups have their individual set of B machines they use for testing and evaluation. Thus, we propose that individual sets of benchmarks from different parts of the community are combined into a global, shared repository. With this paper, we start this endeavour, and create an index of our specifications as described in Sect. While we are most involved in the B and Event-B community, we think that similar issues are present in other communities which make up the ABZ conference. Thus, we explicitly want to invite everyone to contribute specifications written in other formalisms as well. The repository is located at: https://github.com/hhu-stups/specifications",

They also allow extension of the information, e.g., for further tools such as Atelier-B [4] or handling of entirely different file formats, e.g., Rodin [1] archives. In order to select suitable set of specifications, one can simply apply a filter predicate testing the formalism or dialect of it. Furthermore, optinal fields enable links between different machines (e.g., due to refinement or different parameter instantiation) and to external information, such as references to articles describing the model, descriptions of the models as well as the author(s) and their contact information. Finally, certain metrics do not make sense for specific use cases of a formalism, or cannot be applied to other formalisms at all.

The expression starting in l. 9 returns a list of all file names of specifications written in the B formalism that are known to have a state space of at least 100 000 states. At the time of writing, there are 45 such machines. This example shows that finding specifications based on certain criteria is fairly easy and necessary for verification tool maintainers.
