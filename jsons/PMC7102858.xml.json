            "text": "Glycosylation produces an abundant, diverse, and highly regulated repertoire of cellular glycans that are frequently attached to proteins and lipids. Viral surface proteins (VSPs) are no exception, often hijacking host cell\u2019s molecular machinery in order to obtain O-linked, N-linked, or C-linked glycans [1]. Although the cell cannot distinguish between host and viral proteins, one difference that is observed is an increase in glycosylation compared to host glycoproteins. The high levels of glycosylation observed in the envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Ebola virus (EBOV), and Lassa virus (LASV), as well as others serve as a protective shield from the host\u2019s immune system [2, 3, 4,5\u2022,6\u2022]. Some specific glycans are important for protein structural stability and the loss or gain of glycans can influence protein function. For example, the loss of either the N2 glycan or N4 glycan from hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope 2 results in total loss of HCV infectivity [7]. In contrast, hemagglutinin (HA), a major surface protein on the influenza (Flu) virus, can lose activity when glycans are positioned close to the HA cleavage site, preventing protease access and virus entry [8,9]. During viral evolution, glycosylation sites are often added and deleted. With this diversity of modification, the complexity of viral glycoproteins that exists in an individual host or host population is increased [10]. Alteration of glycosylation site(s) can have dramatic impacts on virus survival and transmissibility [11,12]. The location of these highly mutable regions is often in the globular head of viral fusion proteins with each virus having a varying number of glycosylation sites (Figure 1\n).",

The initial glycan is processed first in the ER by trimming three Glc sugars resulting in a high-mannose N-glycan. As the protein passes through the Golgi apparatus, differentially expressed glycosidases and glycosyltransferases further trim, elongate, and branch the glycan moiety resulting in hybrid or complex-type N-glycans [21,22]. Most VSPs contain N-glycosylation with HIV-1, coronavirus (CoV), and EBOV surface proteins containing more than 20 N-glycosylation sites [5\u2022,23\u2022,24\u2022\u2022] and Flu and LASV containing fewer than 11 N-glycosylation sites [25\u2022,26,27].",

Analysis of protein glycosylation by MS is typically achieved using two main approaches: glycans are released from the peptide backbone either enzymatically or chemically, or the glycoprotein can be subjected to protease digestion, producing a mixture of peptides and glycopeptides. These glycans/glycopeptides are then chromatographically separated before ionization into the mass spectrometer where MS and tandem MS data are obtained (Figure 2\n, for review of MS approaches to glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses, see Ruhaak et al. [38\u2022\u2022]).",

Complete release of glycans by PNGase F results in the deamidation of the asparagine to aspartic acid which is confirmed by tandem MS to identify the site of glycosylation, such as for the SARS spike protein [63]. Alternatively, to mitigate error caused by spontaneous deamidation, an endoglycosidase (Endo) is used to identify the site of glycosylation by consolidating the glycan heterogeneity into one oligosaccharide through a partial glycan cleavage [64]. Each Endo has specificity for a different type of N-glycan, but all cleave between the two GlcNAc residues in the diactylchiobiose core of the oligosaccharide leaving a single GlcNAc or a disaccharide of FucGlcNAc linked to the asparagine [65, 66, 67]. These glycopeptides are identified by tandem MS using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation, which preferentially cleaves along the peptide backbone (N\u2014C\u03b1 bond) leaving the sugar moiety intact [68] (Figure 3c). These methods are especially important for VSPs that have a high number of potential NGS such as HIV-1 Env, Flu HA, and LASV GP among others.",

Go et al. produced a heatmap generated from the clustering analysis of the glycosylation site occupancy analysis of 40 NGS observed among early and late HIV-1 Env immunogens [70]. The ratio of the intensities of peptides with aspartic acid (occupied sites) to peptides with asparagine residues (unoccupied sites) was calculated to estimate site occupancy. When this was done for flu HA (HAA/Hong Kong/1/1968) >90% occupancy of 9 of the 11 sites was reported [25\u2022]. A similar method was utilized in the analysis of ninety-four HIV-1 Env variants and reported that 83% of possible sequons were present with 92% of those sequons exhibiting full or partial occupancy [62\u2022]. For VSPs such as HIV-1 Env and Flu HA with many sites of N-glycosylation, the possibility of unoccupied NGS exists and their presence or absence could alter key interactions that influence protein function.",

While the methodology utilized is the same, how the data are presented (i.e. table, pie charts, bar graphs) and the amount of information reported (type of glycan, glycan branches or all oligosaccharides observed) has varied (Figure 4\n). The high degree of reproducibility between technical and biological replicates along with reports demonstrating glycopeptide ionization is driven by the peptide (not the glycan) has resulted in quantitative profiles becoming a standard mode of reporting single-site heterogeneity [78, 79, 80].

This is because the glycoproteins are produced in a manner that limits their glycosylation. A study of the CoV spike glycoprotein combined EM data and MS data and confirmed 26 of 27 potential NGS that were subsequently mapped onto the structure or resulting schematic. From this analysis, glycans masking the receptor binding loops of conserved regions were observed [5\u2022]. Similar studies have been done for HIV-1 Env, LASV GP, and EBOV GPs which all show glycan structures masking conserved receptor binding regions [3,6\u2022,49\u2022\u2022,93].",

However, when these results vary based off viral strain or the glycosylation site is not in an obvious inhibitory location on the structure, it can be difficult to understand the mechanism by which the glycan alters the VSP function. MS glycan profiling data, such as site-occupancy and site-specific heterogeneity profiles provide a means to better understand why specific glycosylation sites are important [62\u2022]. The N301 glycan on HIV-1 Env, for example, has been shown to be essential for PGT128 neutralization in some viral variants, but not all [100]. When this information is coupled with the known shift in site-specific N-glycan heterogeneity, based off presence or absence of neighboring glycans [24\u2022\u2022], researchers can begin to better understand the mechanism by which certain glycan mutations (but not others) help the virus to evade the immune system.",

The efforts of multiple groups have led to a set of essential MS analyses that provide specific details about VSP glycosylation, such as released glycan profiles, glycan site localization, site-occupancy, and site-specific glycan heterogeneity profiles. When the glycoprofiling data are used in conjunction with molecular and structural experiments, virologist can begin to establish how specific glycans and glycan types may affect virulence through modulating virus receptor binding, masking antigenic sites, or by stimulating the host immune response. Understanding how this heterogenous post-translational modification can fine-tune VSP function will provide unique insights into virus biology, which can only be addressed by considering the VSPs and the attached glycan as one complete biomolecule.",
