            "text": "The recent pandemic of a novel Coronavirus has brought the need for more aggressive blood conservation strategies to the forefront of many hospital disaster management policies. In particularly short supply are platelets. Platelet transfusions are one of the higher risk, high cost, and low availability blood components to transfuse. This is due to the fact that they are stored at room temperature in plasma creating the perfect medium for bacteria. This type of storage preserves structure and function but necessitates short outdates, wastage, additional testing, and is expensive. Despite all of the additional precautions , the reported rate of transfusion transmitted infections remains > 3 times higher in platelets compared to red cell products; and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is almost 4 times higher in female vs. male donated products. [1] [2] To address the infectious risk, pathogen-inactivation technologies are now widely used in many countries, but this also increases the cost in addition to decreasing the number of available doses due to platelet loss during processing. 3 It is because of these patient risks and inventory challenges that many transfusion services have strict evidence based criteria for transfusion that are frequently audited.",

Upon further investigation, we observed a trend of bioindustry cellular therapy trials establishing arbitrary non-evidence based guidelines for transfusion. Of 86 clinical trial records for cellular therapies covering 19 protocols, 67% of released platelets did not meet hospital transfusion guidelines established by an interdisciplinary team of experts compared to only 18% out of guideline release in patients who were not on a cellular therapy protocol. Platelet transfusion thresholds for the clinical trials ranged from 20,000-150,000/\u00b5L (median 50,000) with no literature cited to justify these increased thresholds.",
