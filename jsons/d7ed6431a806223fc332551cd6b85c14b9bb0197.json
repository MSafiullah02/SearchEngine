It has devastating complications arising from either a sudden loss of blood supply to the brain (ischemic stroke) or rupturing of blood vessels in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) (Deb, Sharma, & Hassan, 2010) . Stroke leads to the induction of inflammatory cascade via migration of activated microglia to the ischemic core, worsening its outcomes (Perera et al., 2006) . The narrow therapeutic window and insufficiency to recover or protect the dying neurons are certain limitations of current treatment strategies for stroke, so there is an urgent need for an alternative approach (Fann et al., 2013; Kaur et al., 2018) . The limitation to improve the aggravated inflammatory condition by currently used thrombolytic agents necessitates newer treatment options for stroke (Carroll, 2009 ). Interferon-\u03b2 is known to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties and can be explored for improving conditions after stroke (Dhib-Jalbut & Marks, 2010) . IFN-\u03b2 plays a role as an anti-inflammatory agent through several immune cascades. IFN-\u03b2 significantly helps in obviating neuro-inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system and improves the pathogenesis of many neurological conditions. A report suggested its role in decreasing neuronal cell death and increasing functional recovery attenuating inflammation after stroke onset (Kuo et al., 2016) .",

IFNs generally act against extracellular biomolecules via the stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and amplify the antigen presentation to specific T cells. They act by both paracrine and autocrine modes for the regulation of acquired and innate immunity via stimulation of intercellular and intracellular networks providing resistance to certain viral infections and maintenance of normal cell survival and tumor cell death (Le, Genin, Baines, & Hiscott, 2000) .",

Type I IFNs include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), delta (\u03b4), epsilon (\u0190), kappa (\u03ba), and omega (\u03c9). Type-II IFNs include gamma (\u03b3) and type-III, also known as IFN-lambda (\u03bb) , have interferon-like activities (Kopitar-Jerala, 2017; Wack, Terczy\u0144ska-Dyla, & Hartmann, 2015) . Type-I IFNs \u03b1 and \u03b2 act by binding to interferon alpha-receptors (IFNARs). The IFNAR is a heterodimeric transmembrane receptor consisting of two subunits that is, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (Sheppard et al., 2003) . The binding of IFNs \u03b1 and \u03b2 with the IFNAR leads to the activation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases. Janus kinase 1 and tyrosine kinase 2 in turn phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2). Activation of STAT 1 and 2 is followed by dimerization and translocation into the nucleus and, by combining with IFN-regulatory factor 9, forms a trimolecular complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). This ISGF3 further binds to DNA sequences, which are known as IFN-stimulated response elements, and directly activates the transcription of ISGs. The signal decays within a period of hours and the STATs are exported back to the cytoplasm for the next signaling process (Figure 1) ",

Immune cells migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) causes breakdown of the BBB due to the release of numerous cytotoxic agents like cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to demyelination and axonal injury which are common outcomes of neurodegeneration (Kuo et al., 2016) . Although the damage caused to neurons is not reparable, immunomodulatory therapies have been reported to decrease inflammation (Markowitz, 2007) . IFN-\u03b2, a polypeptide produced by fibroblasts, attaches to its specific receptor and initiates a complex transcriptional reaction producing a pharmacological response at the site of injury. Markowitz reported that IFN-\u03b2 helps in suppressing antigen presentation, decreasing T cell proliferation, and altering cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase expression (Kieseier, 2011; Markowitz, 2007) .",

The onset of ischemia is mainly linked with the extravasation of plasma-derived protein, bioactive phospholipids, BBB disruption, and prompt resident MG activation and infiltration into the ischemic site. These multifarious events lead to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like chemokines (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1b, and endogenous NO release at the injury site, culminating in neuronal death (Denes, Thornton, Rothwell, & Allan, 2010; Weinstein et al., 2010) . During ischemic injury, chemokine induction enhances the peripheral immune cell recruitment to the ischemic brain. Chemokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), CCL2, and CCL3 are essential in the recruitment of monocytes/macrophage, while Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3 (CXCL3) is essential for neutrophil recruitment (Kuo et al., 2016) .

Scientists have reported the significant effect of IFN-\u03b2 on the production of MMP-9 and chemokines in MG, a major producer of inflammatory cytokines implicated F I G U R E 2 Mechanism of action of IFN-\u03b2. (a) After ischemic injury, immune cells like mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils from the circulation release the inflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory cytokines include IL-6, IL-4, IL-1B, IL-23p9, and TNF-\u03b1. At ischemic injury site, there is over-expression of these inflammatory cytokines. These overexpressed inflammatory cytokines lead to CNS inflammation. Increased CNS inflammation results in infarct formation in the brain. IFN-\u03b2 helps in suppressing overexpressed inflammatory cytokines and ultimately helps in reducing the brain infarct in ischemic brain. (b) After an ischemic injury on the ipsilateral side of the hemisphere, there are increased expressions of IBA1 (specifically expressed in microglial cells (MGs), helps in MG regulation) in the cortex. Increased IBA1 results in the transformation of resting MGs to reactive MGs. Reactive MGs influence release of inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL-6, IL-4, IL-1B, IL-23p9, and TNF-\u03b1 leads to cytotoxicity which in turn results in infarct formation in the brain at the injury site. IFN-\u03b2 inhibits upregulated IBA1 expression in the cortex of ipsilateral side and reduces the MG activation in the ischemic brain [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] as a mediator of neuroinflammation (Kuo et al., 2016) . It was found that in the ischemic brain, there is a dramatic increase in the expression of CCL3, CXCL3, and MMP-9 in the ipsilateral part but not in the contralateral part of the brain. IFN-\u03b2 treatment helps in reducing the Cerebral ischemic injury followed by reperfusion is mainly responsible for infiltration of peripheral immune cells consisting of T cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages, resulting in secondary brain injury eventually responsible for increasing the degree of brain infarction (Benakis et al., 2015; Wang, Tang, & Yenari, 2007) . Scientists have also reported that throughout the course of ischemic injury, there is a significant rise in various cell counts including CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils and CD45hiCD11b+ monocytes/ macrophages in the ipsilateral part of the ischemic brain. In addition, they found that IFN-\u03b2 treatment significantly helps in lowering the levels of these cells (Kuo et al., 2016) (Figure 3 ).",

There is arise in the numbers of CD4+T cells and \u03b3\u03b4T cells in the ischemic brain and this leads to F I G U R E 3 Mechanism of action of IFN-\u03b2. (a) Ischemic injury followed by reperfusion. Within hours of ischemia, upregulation of adhesion molecules expression (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin,) on the brain endothelial surface. These upregulated adhesion molecules increase the influx of inflammatory cells (e.g., monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells) to the ischemic brain, causing Infarct formation. IFN-\u03b2 reduces the upregulated adhesion molecule expression (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) and helps in reducing the infarct formation by decreasing inflammatory cell influx into the brain. (b) After ischemic injury, resting microglial cells are activated and increase the release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 1B (IL-1B), IL-8 which facilitate inflammatory cellinfiltration (monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells) at the injury site in the brain. Increased infiltration of inflammatory cells compromises the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and leads to secondary brain injury, responsible for increased infarct area in the brain. IFN-\u03b2 impairs the ischemia-induced chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3 (CXCL3), and MMP-9 expressions and helps to reduce brain infarct. (c) Ischemic injury is followed with reperfusion. Reperfusion increases the peripheral immune cell infiltration (CD45hiCD11b+, CD11b+Ly6G+, CD4+, \u03b3\u03b4 T Cells) at brain injury and leads to BBB compromise; it leads to BBB disruption and secondary brain injury, results in infarct formation in the brain. IFN-\u03b2 lowers the number of infiltrating cells that is, CD45hiCD11b+, CD11b+Ly6G+, CD4+, \u03b3\u03b4 T Cells in ipsilateral side of the brain and shows a protective role in ischemic stroke by decreasing BBB disruption [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] the BBB breakdown and increased infarct size associated with induction of MMP3 and MMP9. IFN-\u03b2 treatment reduces both CD4+T cell and \u03b3\u03b4T cell numbers and decreases the infarct size. IFN-\u03b2 treatment suppresses the infiltration of various peripheral immune cells like neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes, and CD4+T cells and \u03b3\u03b4T cells, providing a protective role in ischemic stroke (Kuo et al., 2016) (Figure 3 ).",

IFN-\u03b2 may play protective and multiphasic roles after ischemic stroke. This review focused on the neuroprotective role of IFN-\u03b2 in ischemic stroke. As there is a growing body of evidence indicating that inflammatory mediators are predominantly deleterious in the primary phase after ischemic stroke, IFN-\u03b2 may be a promising treatment option against ischemic stroke and may be salutary for future adjuvant therapy. With these preclinical findings, IFN-\u03b2 has entered the clinical level as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. However, some more substantial findings are required to be carried out in the future for better understanding of ischemic stroke in relation with CNS inflammation, cytotoxicity, BBB dysfunction, and the therapeutic potential of IFN-\u03b2 in ischemic stroke.

B cells secrete inflammatory mediators that are responsible for stimulating plasma cells to produce immunoglobulins (IGs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)(Dalakas, 2008). B cell activating factor (BAFF), belonging to the TNF family, is upregulated in the blood(Krumbholz et al., 2008) and is crucial for maintaining B cells level at the inflammation site and can aggravate local inflammation by facilitating B cell survival(Krumbholz et al., 2005). IFN-\u03b2 modulates B-cell function which can alter antigen presentation. Expression of MHC II on B cells is reduced post-therapy with the help of IFN-\u03b2 through a decrease in CD80 expression that inhibits antigen presentation to CD8+T cells(Gen\u00e7, Dona, & Reder, 1997;Jiang et al., 1995). IFN-\u03b2 treatment results in the upregulation of CD86 expressing B cells and contributes to the reduction of type 1 T helper (Th1) cell secretion of inflammatory cytokines(Huang, Ito, Dangond, & Dhib-Jalbut, 2013).Levels of BAFF are also upregulated in blood leukocytes and serum with IFN-\u03b2 therapy, showing elevated B cell function(Krumbholz et al., 2008). With the correct combination of stimuli, it can lead to increased B cell secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-8 and IL-10, suggesting that IFN-\u03b2 can increase CD4 and CD8 regulatory T cells along with regulatory B cells(Meinl, Krumbholz, & Hohlfeld, 2006).",

            "text": "Ischemic strokeCNS inflammation induced due to ischemic conditions plays an essential role in stroke pathophysiology and exacerbates infarct formation at the injury site(Amantea et al., 2015;Benakis, Garcia-Bonilla, Iadecola, & Anrather, 2015;Kawabori & Yenari, 2015). IFN-\u03b2 markedly reduces infarct size by inhibition of the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-23p19, IL-1b, and TNF-\u03b1; all of these cytokines are found to be increased in the ipsilateral part of the ischemic brain(Kuo et al., 2016) (Figure 2). Endogenous IFN-\u03b2 signaling limits local inflammation, regulates peripheral immune cells, and, thereby, may contribute positively to stroke outcome(In\u00e1cio et al., 2015).Rapidly activated MGs in response to ischemic injury are a major factor for the production of inflammatory mediators and increased phagocytosis. Activated MGs trigger innate immune responses followed by increased production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), leading to BBB damage. These inflammatory mediators cause various cytotoxic effects due to the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines at the ischemic site(Benakis et al., 2015;Xia, Han, Huang, & Ying, 2010). Recent findings report that during cerebral ischemia, activated MGs exhibit a high level of ionized calcium-bind-ing adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) expression, confirmed by confocal images showing round and amoeboid shaped morphology with very short processes and bigger soma in the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere (Kuo et al., 2016). IFN-\u03b2 treatment helps in the suppression of lBA1 expression by reducing MG activation at the site of injury, there by showing ramified morphology with longitudinally branched and smaller soma. Kuo et al. found that IFN-\u03b2's inhibitory effect on activation of MG is due to a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 23p19 (IL-23p19), IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 at the site of infarct (Kuo et al., 2016) (Figure 2).A study carried out by Cruz et al. reported that IFN-\u03b2 requires IFN regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) to limit ischemic stroke injury. Mice lacking IRF2BP2-deficient microglia/macrophages lost the anti-inflammatory property of IFN-\u03b2, which failed to protect them from ischemic injuries(Cruz et al., 2017). Recent work has identified that TLRs and type 1 IFN signaling mediate neuroprotection in both ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning (IPC)(McDonough et al., 2017). It has been reported that in a mouse model of ischemic injury type 1, IFN signaling is essential for IPC-directed neuroprotection in white matter(Hamner et al., 2015) and gray matter(Stevens et al., 2011). McDonough et al. proposed that during ischemia/reperfusion injury MGs lead to the activation of endogenous neuroprotection pathways which are dependent on the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) response(McDonough & Weinstein, 2016).Wang et al. (2017) reported that by promoting expression of TIR-domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF) with the compound Dexmedetomidine improved stroke recovery, supporting the beneficial effect of interferon-beta in ischemic stroke(Wang et al., 2017).Experimental preconditioning models are robust and primarily focus on neuroprotective actions(Gesuete et al., 2012). Gesuete et al., uncovered the protective preconditioning effect of polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly-ICLC) against cerebral ischemic injury. They found that treatment with poly-ICLC in in vitro and in vivo ischemia models induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression and type I IFN signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells, which attenuated BBB dysfunction and was required for neuroprotection against ischemic injury(Gesuete et al., 2012).",

Further treatment with IFN-\u03b2 helps in reducing upregulated ICAM-1 and E-selectin in the ipsilateral hemispheres of animals induced with ischemic stroke. Also, there is an increase in VCAM-1 expression in ischemic stroke, but IFN-\u03b2 treatment has not shown any effect on its expression(Kuo et al., 2016). They also studied IFN-\u03b2 effect on endothelial cell lines bEnd.3. Activation of bEnd.3 cell lines with TNF-\u03b1 upregulates ICAM-1 and E-selectin at both levels that is, at the genetic level and protein level. They found that IFN-\u03b2 treatment helps to obviate TNF-\u03b1-induced P-selectin, ICAM-1, and E-selectin upregulation but failed inattenuating VCAM-1 expression which is induced due to TNF-\u03b1 on the surface of the cell(Kuo et al., 2016;Su\u00e1rez, Wang, Manes, & Pober, 2010) (Figure 3). However, the beneficial effect of IFN-\u03b2 to counteract ischemic stroke injury remains controversial. It was reported by Maier et al. that IFN-\u03b2 failed to protect ischemic injury in a model of transient focal stroke(Maier, Yu, Nishi, Lathrop, & Chan, 2006).",
