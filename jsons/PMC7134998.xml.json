Although several plans are available online [9], [10], each institution should customize their plan to meet their unique needs and challenges. A good plan would be one that the users understand, are comfortable with, and can use to gain access to the information they need rapidly. The plan should be a living document of work in progress, with mechanisms for regular and periodic internal reviews to ensure that it stays current. It is vital to ensure continued availability and accessibility of the plan to all who may need to use it; this may require simultaneous availability of the plan in different forms, including print, electronic media, intranet, and Internet, in the event that one form were to become unavailable during times of crisis.",

A multidisciplinary team should be organized to validate the functionality of the plan and should include key individuals from the emergency department, infection control, disaster management, and physical plant/engineering. This team should use the \u201ctracer methodology\u201d [11] to do a walk-around of the process of registration, triage, emergency department assessment, and admission to the hospital, exercising different scenarios of initial presentation. This process should be more than simply touring the facility; it should include taking the time to understand the physical layouts, patient flow, and security systems. It should be ensured that the waiting areas have proper signage directing patients to use appropriate cough etiquette and have the physical capability to separate patients with respiratory symptoms.",

As part of a tiered planning approach with escalating action thresholds, this alert should be executable at a level below the facility's disaster alert code to facilitate its rapid implementation, without expending significant resources toward handling the multiple false alarms that possibly may be generated by its lower threshold. The biothreat containment alert should prompt initiation of a separate triage location to avoid contamination of other parts of the emergency department and, similar to a cardiac arrest code, should lead to designated personnel reporting to an assigned location and a \u201cdisaster cart\u201d with additional backup medical equipment and supplies being delivered to the \u201chot zone.\u201d A departmental checklist of necessary immediate actions to be taken should be an integral part of this alert.

The idea is to assess individual components of the preparedness plan during different shifts and to prioritize testing of the weakest link. Drills should not be intended as a test in the strictest sense, but rather as an opportunity to identify weakness; build teamwork; improve coordination; and enhance acquired skills, knowledge, and competencies. After completion of the drill, the institution should ensure a proper debriefing session facilitated by trained observers [18], to maximize the learning opportunity, provide for constructive critique, and discuss changes that need to be implemented as a result of the exercise.",

This assumption would imply staff working longer hours and extra shifts and needing arrangements for overnight stay in the hospital. Medical equipment and other hospital supplies, including personal protective gear and pharmaceutical caches, would need to be stocked adequately to cater to the increased demand during this period.

The hospital should partner with the local media in the planning phase so that they can serve the vital role of disseminating key messages to the public and help portray a realistic image to the national media. This platform would enable communication to the public in a consistent and timely way and go a long way in preparing for the \u201cfear factor\u201d and prevent the system from getting overwhelmed by the \u201cworried well.\u201d",

So the question remains, can the medical community practically plan for everything? Although it is true that \u201cforecasting is always difficult, particularly when it's the future we are dealing with,\u201d if one has a good plan for dealing with the probable, one might stand a better chance of responding adequately to the improbable. In this context, Eisenhower's dictum could be interpreted to mean that in planning for a bioterrorist threat, original plans would need to be changed to address the dynamics caused by uncertainty, but proper planning with periodic testing would go a long way in minimizing the chaos associated with this change. If after all this preparation the outlook still looks dismal, some consolation can be derived from the quote of a German officer, \u201cthe reason the American army does so well in war is because war is chaos and the American army practices chaos on a daily basis.\u201d",
