            "text": "Herpesviruses (HV) which are subdivided into three subfamilies (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) possess large double-stranded DNA genomes encoding approximately 100\u2013200 genes. HV genomes remain latent in their natural host and can initiate a productive infection from latently infected cells resulting in virus shedding and transmission of virus progeny to a new host [1], [2]. During the long history of coevolution and cospeciation with their hosts, HV adopted multiple mechanisms to deal with immune functions that permit establishing a life-long infection with efficient replication and transmission, even in the presence of repeatedly boostered antiviral immune responses [3], [4]. Typically, the herpesviral evasion strategy prominently targets those immune responses that attack and contain the virus with the highest efficiency, i.e. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, interferons and Abs. On the other hand, fine-tuning of the host defence strategies to avoid irreversible harm has led to activation of cellular and humoral immunity that tightly control herpesviral infections in a hierarchical but also redundant manner [5]. To date, eight human herpesviruses, most of which are widespread in the population, are known (listed in Table 1\n). In the majority of cases, the viruses cause relatively mild or even asymptomatic infections in the immmunocompetent host. However, when the intricate balance between viral immune escape and the host's immunity is lost, uncontrolled virus replication leads to severe disease manifestation as is frequently observed in immunocompromised patients or congenitally infected babies [6].",

            "text": "The complement system and antiviral Abs form a first line of antiviral defence operating before a virion is able to attach to its cellular receptor mediating entry into the host cell to initiate the replicative cycle [7]. The complement system includes proteolytic enzymes, inflammatory proteins, cell surface receptors and proteins that cause cell death through osmotic lysis after insertion into biological membranes. Therefore, a primary requirement is that the complement cascade becomes initiated only in response to infection and cannot be initiated in a random fashion. The complement factors opsonise and lyse Ab-coated viral particles (virolysis) and infected cells (cytolysis) [8], [9]. A broad range of host cells expresses several complement-inhibiting proteins which protect tissues from complement-mediated lysis by the inhibition and dissociation of C3 convertases that are central for the amplification of the complement system [10]. Notably, the cell surface expression of CD46 and CD55, two of the complement control proteins (CCP), is strongly enhanced on the plasma membrane of HCMV-infected cells. The upregulated CD55 expression increases the capacity to regulate C3 deposition and thus protects CMV-infected cells from complement-mediated lysis [11]. The selective incorporation of CCPs, i.e. CD55, CD59 and CD46, into virions and the discovery of virus-encoded regulators of complement activation (RCA) underscore the important antiviral role of the complement system [12], [13].",

First, the risk of virus transmission and the extent of neonatal disease is much lower if the mother has recurrent as compared to primary genital infection [48]. Second, in mouse models of HSV-2 infection, various vaccination protocols generated Abs responses which mediated partial vaginal immunity [49], [50]. Recent efforts for vaccine generation employed glycoprotein-D (gD) subunit formulations since gD is a target for neutralising Abs due to the fact that gD directly interacts with HSV receptors on the cell surface to trigger virus entry. Two phase 3 studies of the GlaxoSmithKline HSV-2 gD-subunit vaccine demonstrated a 74% efficacy in preventing occurrence of genital herpes disease in women seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, while the vaccine was completely ineffective in decreasing HSV-2 infection in men or women seropositive for HSV-1 [51]. Similarly, the CHIRON gB2/gD2 vaccine using similar protein components, but administered with a different adjuvant, was ineffective in preventing HSV-2 infection [52].",

In immunocompetent children varicella is usually a benign, self-limited disease and no general treatment is required. In contrast, non-immune patients belonging to high-risk groups like immunocompromised individuals with exposure to VZV and newborns whose mothers undergo varicella at delivery must receive VZV immunoglobulins (VZIG). In these situations, varicella can take a life-threatening course of infection [53]. While VZIG is clearly efficient in post-exposure prophylaxis, it is not beneficial for therapy of already established VZV infection [54]. Herpes zoster occurs in the presence of VZV-specific Abs. Accordingly, VZIG has no preventive or therapeutic effect on herpes zoster, underlining the resilience of HVs to IgG.",

Further Ig receptors exert essential functions in distributing Abs, like the polymeric Ig receptor which transports IgA and IgM across epithelia [59] or the neonatal FcR (FcRn) which delivers maternal IgG to the foetus across the placenta [59]. Recently, a new family consisting of several members of B-cell-expressed FcR homologs has been discovered [60], the precise function of which remains to be elucidated. All classes of cellular FcRs belong to the immunoglobulin supergene family (IgSF) of cell surface molecules. IgSF domains are characterised by a conserved structural motif termed the immunoglobulin fold (reviewed in Ref. [61]) that consists of two layers of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets, connected by variable loops. The Ig domain is an autonomous folding unit with manifold occurrence in various kinds of proteins.",

Fc\u03b3RI (CD64) is a transmembrane protein with three extracellular Ig domains of the C2 class of Ig domains (see Fig. 1\n), which binds to human IgG-Fc with high affinity. The third, juxtamembrane domain is responsible for the high affinity binding while the first two domains alone can mediate only weak binding to IgG [63].

They possess two extracellular Ig domains with exhibit closest similarity to the membrane distal domains of Fc\u03b3RI. The Fc\u03b3RII isoforms A and B are transmembrane proteins differing in their cytoplasmic portion, while Fc\u03b3RIII can be expressed as a transmembrane or GPI-linked form (Fig. 1)\n[64]. The cellular Fc\u03b3Rs use distinct intracytoplasmic motifs for signal transduction into the cell. Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB contain an \u201cimmunoreceptor-tyrosine-based activation motif\u201d (ITAM) or \u201cimmunoreceptor-tyrosine-based inhibitory motif\u201d (ITIM), respectively, in their cytoplasmic tail. Both motifs are phosphorylated upon receptor engagement but with opposed outcome: While the ITAMs preferentially recruit src-family tyrosine kinases and induce cellular activation, ITIM phosphorylation serves to terminate signaling, mostly via the SH2-domain-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP). Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIII do not contain intrinsic signaling properties but share the common FcR \u03b3 chain. Alternatively, Fc\u03b3RIII can utilise the closely related \u03b6 chain of the T-cell-receptor complex. The FcR \u03b3 and the \u03b6 chain each contain an ITAM motif to induce activatory signaling events like the Fc\u03b3RIIA cytoplasmic moiety [62]. The cross-linking of Fc\u03b3RI-bound IgG by multivalent antigens, or the binding of preformed immune complexes with Fc\u03b3RII or Fc\u03b3RIII, results in clustering of the Fc\u03b3R and triggering of a variety of effector mechanisms, such as ADCC, phagocytosis, the release of cytokines, enhanced antigen presentation, and the regulation of Ig production by B cells [62].

Mice devoid of the common FcR \u03b3 chain display pleiotropic defects of immune effector cells including impaired macrophage phagocytosis and NK-cell-mediated ADCC as well as defective mast cell-dependent allergic responses [71]. The similar phenotype of Fc\u03b3RIII-deficient mice illustrates the intimate functional cooperation with the \u03b3 chain [72]. The critical regulatory (inhibitory) effect of Fc\u03b3RIIB on various immune cells is reflected by the hyperreactivity of the immune system in Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient animals. Due to the lack of control of B cell proliferation, Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice develop various forms of autoimmune diseases, either spontaneously or after experimental induction [73], [74]. Mast cells from Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient animals are hypersensitive to IgG-induced degranulation which culminates in enhanced passive cutaneous analphylaxis reactions [74].",

The responsible membrane proteins have subsequently been identified as a complex formed by the glycoproteins gE and gI (Fig. 1)\n[89], which are encoded by the HSV genes US (unique short) 7/US8 and are dispensable for HSV infection and replication in vitro. Homologous molecules to gE and gI are found in HSV-2 [84], VZV [90], PRV [91] and MDV [87]. gE and gI are exposed on the surface of infected cells and represent also the most abundant structural glycoproteins within the virus envelope. Alignment of a limited portion of the extracellular chain of gE reveals a low sequence similarity with the second domain of cFc\u03b3Rs [92]. While gE alone binds only aggregated IgG with low affinity, complex formation with gI induces a high affinity receptor which is able to fix monomeric IgG. The HSV-1 gE:gI complex is a heterodimer composed of one molecule each and binds IgG with 1:1 stoichiometry. The affinity for IgG4 is highest with K\nD=40 nM [93]. The gE:gI complex binds IgG between the second and third Ig domain, at the C\u03b32\u2013C\u03b33 interface, which is similar to the Fc-binding site of rheumatoid factors and protein A from Staphylococcus aureus. The importance of H435 of IgG1 for the interaction correlates with the failure to bind many IgG3 subclass allotypes, where the corresponding residue is an arginine [93].",

According to this model, an IgG molecule recognising an epitope on the surface of a virus-infected cell or a virion via its clonotypic antigen binding Fab domain is simultaneously sequestered by the gE:gI complex via its Fc part. Thus, the IgG Fc domain is prevented from recruiting effector mechanisms, i.e. the complement component C1q or Fc\u03b3R-expressing cytotoxic effector cells. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, the competition of binding sites between gE:gI and protein A on the Fc\u2013C\u03b32\u2013C\u03b33 interface was exploited to demonstrate the masking of the Fc part of IgG through the viral Fc\u03b3R when bound to HSV-infected cells via its antigen-binding sites [97]. Second, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies have demonstrated that the IgG molecule structure is indeed equipped with sufficient intrinsic flexibility allowing the simultaneous interaction of the Fab and Fc domains with separate ligands displayed on the same cell or virion surface [98].",

The extracellular region includes three potential N-glycosylation sites and is predicted to form one IgSF-like domain [83]. This prediction is based on homology with the second domain of the cFc\u03b3RIII/RII, which forms the essential IgG binding moiety of cFc\u03b3Rs [103]. Important determinants of the three cFc\u03b3RIII binding regions for Fc fragment are conserved in the gp34 sequence. Interestingly, secondary structure calculations predict \u03b1-helical interruptions of the \u03b2-sheet structure of the IgSF domain, a feature which resembles the FcRn, where \u03b1-helices also make important contributions to the binding interface with hIgG [104]. The cytoplasmic tail of gp34 contains a conserved dileucine motif (DXXXLL) which could indicate a role in intracellular targeting of IgG\u2013gp34 complexes to the endocytic route [105]. Thus, similar to VZV gE:gI, HCMV gp34 might remove bound IgG from the plasma membrane of infected cells to prevent ADCL and ADCC. In contrast to the HSV gE:gI Fc\u03b3R, HCMV-infected cells were shown to bind to all 4 subclasses of human IgG [106] with graduated affinity (IgG1\u2265IgG4>IgG2>IgG3 [107]). However, the experimental setting used could not dissolve the separate Ig binding properties of gp34 and gp68.

This fact is also evident from plaque reduction assays with HCMV-immune human sera performed in the presence of an excess of Fc fragments or \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m) as a control protein. While the addition of Fc but not \u03b22m improves the neutralising efficiency of HCMV-IgG in a dose-dependent manner, the activity of Measles virus (MV)-specific IgG is completely independent of Fc when neutralising MV virions which do not possess vFc\u03b3Rs (Reinhard, H. and Hengel H., unpublished observations). This finding may have obvious implications for the in-vivo neutralisation of HCMV: In body fluids like blood, the high amount of non-immune IgG might exert a similar effect like the Fc fragment in the neutralisation assay discussed above, i.e. enhance HCMV virion neutralisation. In contrast, at sites where IgG concentrations are significantly lower than in serum, i.e. on mucosal surfaces and body fluids like saliva, breast milk and genital fluids the HCMV vFc\u03b3Rs should promote virus shedding and horizontal transmission. In such an environment vFc\u03b3Rs are critically required to confer resistance of HCMV particles against neutralising IgG.",

In this context, it is interesting that HCMV infection is able to confer HIV-susceptibility to otherwise nonpermissive fibroblasts [109]. This could be explained by Ab-coated HIV particles attaching via the vFc\u03b3Rs to the surface of HCMV-infected cells. By this mechanism HIV virions might be endocytosed and establish HIV infection.

The predicted 569-aa type I transmembrane glycoprotein has a calculated mass of 65 kDa and is synthesised during the early and late phase of MCMV replication. The MCMV Fc\u03b3R is highly glycosylated reaching a MW of 105 kDa, which is reduced to a single band of 68 kDa by deglycosylation. The m138 protein can be precipitated with mouse IgG-Fc fragment coupled to protein A indicating non-overlapping binding sites as it is the case for the HCMV Fc\u03b3Rs. Alignment of the m138 sequence with mouse cFc\u03b3Rs displays a more significant degree of homology and predicts a composition of three Fc\u03b3R-related IgSF-like domains. (Fig. 1, A.

Preliminary data show that both RCMV-encoded m138 homologs constitute functional vFc\u03b3Rs (A. Bigl, M. Budt, S. Voigt, A. Zimmermann, unpublished observation). The MCMV model provides an unique opportunity to assess the biological role of an vFc\u03b3R for viral pathogenesis and immune control in vivo. To this end the replication of a MCMV m138 gene deletion mutant, \u0394m138, was analysed in mice and revealed a dramatically attenuated phenotype in vivo. Surprisingly, in \u03bcmt\u2212/\u2212 mice lacking the Ig \u03bc chain, defective in B cell development and devoid of Abs, the \u0394m138 virus was not rescued from attenuation. From this finding it was concluded that the major biological function of the MCMV Fc\u03b3R must not be related to IgG binding but includes a more prominent IgG-unrelated function as it is known for HSV gE:gI [113]. However, the replacement of the m138 gene sequence by inserting the LacZ gene of Escherichia coli might have affected genes neighbouring m138, which possess common transcription units with m138\n[82] and have been implicated in macrophage tropism and efficient MCMV replication in vivo [114]. Furthermore, the viral replication was investigated during primary MCMV infection, where Abs do not contribute to virus immune control [31]. Therefore, the available data do not preclude an Ab-dependent role for the MCMV Fc\u03b3R at later phases of infection when Abs effectively limit virus dissemination and transmission [5], [31]. Studies introducing more subtle changes in the m138 gene without affecting adjacent genes are required to elucidate putative IgG-dependent functions of the MCMV Fc\u03b3R.",

Due to the limitations of conventional antiviral drug therapy, the design of potent virus-specific Abs as a therapeutical tool is demanding. Published data support the notion that IgG has an important but certainly not exclusive immunological role against herpesviral infections, and is a potential tool of immunoprophylaxis [19], [116]. As outlined above, viral Fc\u03b3Rs are prime suspects for the remarkable ability of HVs to counteract IgG effector functions. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that antiviral Abs could reach a more potent antiviral efficiency when resisting Fc\u03b3R-mediated attenuation. According to this concept, an ideal IgG-Fc domain would not be bound by a vFc\u03b3R, while still retaining normal affinity to the ligands that recruit protective components of the immune system. As an example, human IgG3 Abs could represent promising candidates for an effective anti-HSV agent since this IgG subclass is a potent activator of the complement cascade [117], but is not blocked by HSV gE:gI [93]. Based on the discrimination of the HSV gE:gI Fc\u03b3R between hIgG1 allotypes [118], even minimal mutations introduced into recombinant Abs could be sufficient to avoid vFc\u03b3R binding, while retaining the functional properties of the molecule with respect to cFc\u03b3Rs and complement.",

Next, as a proof of principle, MCMV-specific monoclonal Abs with a therapeutic potential [116] are available which will allow to assess the therapeutic benefit of a mutated vFc\u03b3R-resistant IgG-Fc module in a variety of infection conditions in vivo. Based on this knowledge, designed IgGs could lead to a new generation of immunopharmacological tools effective against the large burden of human herpesviral diseases.",

(A) Antiviral IgG binds to its cognate viral antigen on the surface of an infected cell or a virus particle via its Fab part. Upon binding, the Fc region recruits the C1q,r,s complex which activates the complement system via the classical pathway, resulting in antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis (ADCL). (B) Alternatively, attachment of bound virus-specific IgG to cFc\u03b3R+-cytotoxic effector cells, e.g. NK cells, mediates cFc\u03b3R cross-linking and triggering of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). (C) Antibody-bipolar bridging: viral Fc\u03b3Rs sequester the Fc part of bound antiviral IgG. This engagement blocks the recruitment of complement proteins or cFc\u03b3Rs and thus mediates protection of the virus particle or infected cell from destruction.",
