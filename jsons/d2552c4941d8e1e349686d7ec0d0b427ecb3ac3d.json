            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus , has resulted in signifi cant economic losses in the European, Asian, and North American swine industries in previous years. PEDV infection causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration, and high morbidity and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. In this chapter, materials and methods for performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the detection of PEDV antigens in frozen or formalin-fi xed, paraffi n-embedded (FFPE) tissues are provided. In IHC of frozen tissues where viral antigens are well preserved, the use of specifi c antibodies labeled with fl uorescence dyes provides excellent advantages and convenience, resulting in high sensitivity and specifi city of IHC and reduction of operation time. In IHC of FFPE tissues where tissue or cell morphology is well preserved, the use of specifi c antibodies labeled with enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, also gives rise to signifi cant advantages in defi ning the correlation of viral antigens with histopathologic lesions. PEDV antigens in frozen tissues are visualized as green staining in the cytoplasm of infected cells by fl uorescent dyes conjugated with antibodies when activated by exciting light of a specifi c wavelength under a fl uorescence microscope. In FFPE tissues, PEDV antigens are visualized as red staining in the cytoplasm of infected cells by the deposition of the substrate chromogen, Fast Red.",

Because of similar clinical and pathogenic features between PEDV and another Alphacoronavirus , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), or a Deltacoronavirus , porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), differential laboratory tests are required for their diagnosis [ 3 -5 ] . Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is useful for the rapid differential diagnosis; however, detection of viral antigens in tissues is essential for confi rming each viral infection .",

            "text": "Viral antigens in frozen, fi xed cells, or tissues can be detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (or immunohistochemical staining) using specifi c antibodies labeled with fl uorescent dyes, such as Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 and fl uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), or enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase (AP) and peroxidase. Immunofl uorescence (IF) staining is the fi rst immunohistochemical staining method but is still widely used in veterinary and medical diagnosis . With fundamentality of antigen -antibody and antibody-antibody binding reactions, antigens are visualized by fl uorescent dyes conjugated with antibodies when activated by an exciting light of a specifi c wavelength (499-519 nm for Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 and 494-521 nm for FITC), under a fl uorescence microscope. Due to the high sensitivity, specifi city, and convenience in using Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 in frozen tissues, this chapter details an IF staining method for the rapid and precise detection of PEDV antigens in PEDV-infected, frozen tissues, contributing to verifi cation of the tissue sites of PEDV replication in infected pigs. A combination of PEDV-specifi c anti-sera as antigen detection antibody and secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 is applied in the IF staining method. However, because of suboptimal conditions of tissue or cell morphology in frozen tissues, this staining method limits investigation of the correlation of PEDV antigens with histopathologic lesions.",

The use of hyperimmune anti-sera or polyclonal antibodies against PEDV in IHC staining is likely able to detect geographically different strains of PEDV and differentiate them from TGEV in tissues [ 8 , 9 ] , but with a potential disadvantage of inducing background or false signals. To improve the sensitivity and specifi city of IHC for the detection of PEDV antigens in tissues, the use of monoclonal antibodies to structural proteins of PEDV, such as spike (S) or membrane (M) protein, has been preferred [ 10 , 11 ] . Prior to their application on the tissues, potential cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to TGEV and PDCoV can be tested by more sensitive assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation, compared to IHC.",
