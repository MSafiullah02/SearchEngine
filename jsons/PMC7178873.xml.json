Throughout this chapter, references are made to the Circular of Information (COI), a joint publication of the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), the American Red Cross, America\u2019s Blood Centers, and the Armed Services Blood Program, which is also recognized by the FDA as an extension of the blood label. This important document is a useful guide to the clinician and is available online [2]. The most recent National Blood Collection Utilization and Survey (NBCUS) reports that 13,775,000 million allogeneic units of whole blood and red cells (RBCs) were transfused in 2011, which is 8.2 % fewer units than in 2008 [3]. Over 20 million blood components were transfused in 2011 (there is a lag time between the receipt and publication of such data in this and similar reports). Blood centers collected 93.4 % of all components and the remaining amount was collected by hospitals [3]. The USA continues to transfuse red cells at a greater rate than many other countries, with 44 transfusions per 1000 population; this however, is a >10 % decrease from 48.8 transfusions per 1000 population in 2008 [3].",

Moreover, allogeneic blood donation is a voluntary, unremunerated process. All donations are tested for blood type, specific antibodies and infectious diseases; platelets are also tested for bacterial contamination before they are released [3]. Units with positive or reactive results are destroyed, with appropriate deferral of the donor, per FDA. About 9 million people in the USA donate blood per year, although it is estimated that a much larger percentage could qualify for donation [3, 5].",

Autologous blood donations are usually whole blood, though specific components may be drawn using automated collection devices. Allogeneic whole blood collections are separated into individual components soon after collection by centrifugation and manufactured into red blood cells (RBCs), plasma, or platelets destined to become pooled platelet products. Apheresis blood collection uses automated technology that allows for the targeted collection of red cells, single-donor platelets, plasma, and leukocytes (usually stem cells or granulocytes). Products may be collected singly or in multiples depending on donor qualification, the device, and FDA regulations. Plasma may be further manufactured into factor derivatives, albumin, and other medical products. Frozen plasma can be further manufactured into cryoprecipitate and cryoprecipitate-poor plasma. Blood products are a limited commodity with variable shelf-lives and the balance between supply and demand is dynamic, requiring cooperation between donors, blood centers and hospitals. Licensed blood products may be shipped across the USA to other areas in need.",

The A and the B allele each encodes for a glycosyltransferase which adds a sugar to the H antigen (FUT 1 gene, chromosome 19 q13.3) [10]. The H antigen resides on an oligosaccharide chain which extends beyond the RBC surface. Adding a specific sugar results in the formation of an A or B antigen [10]. Type O blood results from the homozygous inheritance of a nonfunctional allele (amorph) most commonly caused by a frameshift mutation, resulting in no glycosyltransferase being produced, and leaving the H antigen on the red cell unaltered [10]. The phenotypes of the ABO blood group system are based on expression of the A, B, and H antigens. A and B alleles are codominant. The O phenotype is recessive. In other words, if the genotype is AO the phenotype is A, and if the genotype is AB the phenotype is AB.",

She claimed that she had the Bombay phenotype, however, the staff did not deem the information to be important and the blood bank was not notified. After several unsuccessful attempts to crossmatch blood for the patient, the sample was referred to the immunohematology reference laboratory (RL) for identification. After extensive workup the Bombay phenotype was identified, and these findings were confirmed with the patient. Fortunately she did not require transfusion, as the only compatible blood for a person with the Bombay phenotype is from a donor with this precise phenotype. The point is that if a patient communicates that they have a rare blood type, the blood bank should be informed, in order to investigate it, and to allow adequate time to locate compatible blood. Such patients may participate in autologous donation and their red cells may be frozen for future use. Patients with unusual blood needs may wear an emergency alert bracelet stating their condition or may verbally relay the information to the clinical staff.",

ABO antibodies are primarily of the IgM type, which fix complement well, and are capable of causing acute, intravascular hemolysis. ABO antibodies of the IgG subtype may cause a delayed, extravascular hemolysis. IgG subtypes may also cross the placenta from the maternal circulation to cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) [12]. Antibodies from some blood group systems are more potent than those in other blood group systems in their ability to cause hemolysis [12]. Only one fatality resulting from ABO-mismatched RBCs was reported to FDA in 2013, accounting for 3 % of the total fatalities reported in that year [13]. Undoubtedly, many more ABO-mismatching events transpire without resulting in fatality. In 2011, a total of 42 such events were reported to the NBCUS, which amounted to 1 occurrence per 495,207 transfusions in the USA [3]. It is worth noting that not all hospitals participate in a program of voluntary transfusion reaction reporting, however fatalities due to transfusion must be reported to FDA [3].",

D antigen expression varies among ethnic groups (Table 19.1). With respect to transfusion, the D antigen is second in importance to the ABO blood group system. For routine transfusion every effort is made to match the ABO/Rh of the unit to the patient; for example, a patient with B-negative blood should ideally receive blood from a donor who is B-negative (type B, Rh-negative), but O-negative blood would be compatible. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are naturally occurring and are present depending on blood type (Table 19.1). Non-ABO red cell antibodies are sometimes found in patient serum and are called \u201cunexpected\u201d alloantibodies. About 5 % of patients have unexpected alloantibodies. These antibodies have formed following exposure (usually from transfusion or pregnancy but possibly from other blood exposure) to red cells possessing antigens foreign to the recipient. Determination of RBC phenotype may be performed by serology and molecular testing and may help to predict what antibodies a sensitized person could make. Antibodies differ in their clinical significance, or in their ability to cause hemolysis and/or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) .

Pediatric patients should be transfused according to weight, usually at a dose of 10\u201315 mL/kg [21]. One milliliter (mL) of RBCs contains 1.08 mg (mg) of iron [22]. Thus if 200 mL RBCs are donated, approximately 200 mg of iron is lost by the donor and that same amount is ultimately transfused into the recipient [22]. Hemoglobin levels are not an accurate predictor of iron stores and this is currently an area of great interest regarding US blood donors [22]. The 2012 REDS-II donor iron status evaluation (RISE) study results reported absent iron stores (ferritin < 12 ng/mL) in as many as 27 % of frequent female donors and 16 % of frequent male donors [22]. Conversely, the issue of iron overload may exist in blood recipients. Clinically significant iron accumulation may be seen following the transfusion of 50 or more RBC units and possibly sooner in pediatric patients [23]. The total amount of iron transfused may be calculated using the following equation, where Kin is the total amount of iron infused:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Kin}=\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{C}\\ \\mathrm{transfused}\\ \\mathrm{in}\\ \\mathrm{mL}\\times \\\\ {} 1.08 \\mathrm{mg}\\ \\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{e}/\\mathrm{mL} \\left[24\\right]\\end{array} $$\n\\end{document}Kin=RBCtransfusedinmL\u00d71.08mgFe/mL[24]Iron is stored in the body as soluble ferritin or as insoluble hemosiderin [23, 24]. Frequently transfused patients have increased morbidity associated with tissue iron deposits in the heart, endocrine organs, and liver [23, 24]. Patients with hemoglobinopathies, hematological malignancies, inherited or acquired anemias, and myelodysplasias are most vulnerable. Depending on the clinical situation, chelation therapy and red cell exchange or erythrocytapheresis, rather than simple transfusion, may benefit some patients [23, 24].",

            "text": "The equivalency of LR to CMV-negative products continues to be debated. Some physicians consider LR blood to be adequate and essentially equivalent to LR blood that is from CMV-seronegative donors. The rationale is that CMV resides within white cells, and with the efficiency of modern LR filters, any risk of CMV would be exceptionally low [29\u201331]. For CMV-seronegative patients, especially those who are peri- or post-transplant, or low birthweight infants, many clinicians request CMV-negative products and accept LR-only products if CMV-negative and LR products are unavailable [29\u201331]. In addition, CMV-seronegative donors who test \u201cnegative for CMV\u201d on their most recent donation carry a small but real risk of transmitting CMV to a recipient, if the donor happens to be newly infected and is in the window period (the time between infection and the time at which the infection can be detected by testing) [29\u201331]. The test performed on donor blood detects anti-CMV antibodies [29\u201331]. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) testing for CMV DNA is available but is not used for donor testing [29\u201331]. Frequent donors (such as platelet donors) have a theoretically higher risk of transmitting CMV since they are able donate several times during the 6\u20138 week window period, whereas a single red cell donor can only donate a single unit in the same period of time [29\u201331]. Indications for CMV-negative blood include the following populations: CMV-seronegative patients who are immunocompromised, fetuses, pregnant females, very-low and low-birthweight infants, transplant recipients of either hematopoietic stem cells or solid organs, and any severely immunocompromised patients including those with HIV.",

TA-GVHD is most-commonly caused by the infusion of competent donor T-lymphocytes into an immunocompromised recipient, though there have been cases involving immunocompetent recipients [37]. LR is inadequate in comparison to irradiation for preventing TA-GVHD, since even with the most recent LR filters residual leukocytes remain and there is no known minimal threshold of T-cells needed to trigger the reaction [38]. TA-GVHD is similar to post-transplant GVHD, affecting HLA-antigen-dense tissues such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract and liver [38]. There are, however, two findings seen with TA-GVHD: bone marrow aplasia and an earlier onset, usually between day 2 and day 50 following transfusion, which distinguishes it from post-transplant GVHD [38].",

Hyperkalemia has been reported in pediatric patients when large volumes are given or blood is quickly infused, however washing irradiated red cells prior to infusion can remove the supernatant potassium if the clinician is concerned [34, 35, 40].

Critically ill patients (ICU) have up to an 8 % incidence of TRALI; and has been reported in up to 15 % in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and 30 % in patients with end-stage liver disease [53, 54]. The vast majority of patients with TRALI recover within 96 h, with aggressive, supportive treatment [52, 55]. Recent data from Medicare billing files have concluded that TRALI is much more prevalent than expected in the elderly, which makes sense because the incidence of ALI increases with age [56\u201358]. With respect to TRALI in pediatric patients, a recent large review performed by the Canadian Blood Services showed that the incidence of reported TRALI was not much different in children (5.58 per 100,000 transfusions) compared to adults (3.75 per 100,000 transfusions) [59].",

During fiscal years 2009\u20132013, 38 % of all transfusion-related deaths reported to FDA were confirmed to be TRALI-related [13]. In fiscal year 2013, FDA reported that 37 % of all transfusion-related deaths were attributable to TRALI. Regarding the 14 TRALI-related deaths in 2013, 51 donors were implicated [13]. Gender data were available for 49 of the donors; 22 were male and 27 were female [13]. Thirty-eight of the donors were tested for the presence of HLA and HNA antibodies and ten of the 14 implicated donors reportedly had antibodies against cognate antigens in the recipient [13]. The majority of the deaths were among patients who received RBC transfusions alone or in patients who received multiple blood products [13].",

The diagnosis of TRALI begins with the recognition of acute lung injury (ALI) in the patient, defined by the American-European Consensus Conference as SpO2 < 90 % or PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg on room air or other demonstration of hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary edema seen as lung infiltrates by frontal chest radiograph [63]. A combined definition of TRALI, as defined by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Working Group and the Canadian Consensus Conference is an acute, non-cardiogenic lung injury occurring within 6 h of beginning a transfusion (though symptoms are often seen in the first 1\u20132 h) with respiratory symptoms of tachypnea, dyspnea, pulmonary edema which may be mild to severe and sometimes seen as acomplete \u201cwhite-out\u201d on frontal chest X-ray [64]. Frothy secretions are sometimes seen coming from the patient\u2019s mouth or endotracheal tube. If measured, the pulmonary artery wedge pressure should be less than 18 mmHg and there must not be any new, abnormal cardiac function [64]. Per this definition, TRALI may also be diagnosed in a patient with worsening preexisting pulmonary insufficiency (unique to the NHLBI definition), such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis [64]. A diagnosis of possible TRALI may apply to patients with preexisting clinical risk factors for ALI, such as recent surgery, burn injury, coagulopathy, chronic alcoholism, sepsis, and carcinoma [64]. There may be hypotension (hypertension followed by hypotension may be seen), fever, chills, non-productive cough, and transient decreases in white cell counts, especially neutrophils [64\u201366].",

However, the antibody, the cognate antigen on the leukocyte surface, and source of complement (plasma) had to be present in order for ALI to occur and if any of the components was omitted, lung damage was obviated [70]. This model has been refined using rats and demonstrated that a minimum number of antigen sites needed to be present on the neutrophils such that antibody binding must reach a threshold before ALI would occur [71]. This work was also relevant in showing that priming with fMLF (N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine,a component of bacterial cell walls) allowed anti-HNA antibodies to directly activate neutrophils in the absence of complement [71].",

            "text": "In vivo TRALI models have demonstrated that a specific monoclonal antibody could cause ALI at a concentration seemingly similar to relatively well patients who come in for a transfusion and develop TRALI [72]. However, in an animal model, when the mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment no TRALI was demonstrated indicating a likely two-event model [72, 73]. Such an in vivo two-event pathogenesis was confirmed in a rat model which also demonstrated that lipids and other biologic response modifiers (BRM) could cause TRALI in older, stored RBCs irrespective of leukoreduction [74]. Both antibodies to MHC class I ligands and the lipids from stored RBCs were capable of priming quiescent neutrophils (PMNs), activating primed PMNs (defined as superoxide anion production and release of granule constituents), and inducing ALI [74]. Specifically, rats that were infused with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, or LPS) alone did not develop ALI, however those rats who received LPS and then received a lipid extraction from 42-day-old RBCs did develop ALI [74]. Importantly extractions from fresh (day 1) RBCs or plasma did not result in ALI [74]. In addition, antibodies to common MHC class I or even class II antibodies caused ALI as the second event in this animal model of TRALI, indicating that TRALI, whether caused by antibodies to specific leukocyte antigens or due to BRMs that directly prime PMNs, appears to be the results of two distinct events [74]. The first event is the clinical condition of the patient, which predisposes him to TRALI and the second event is the infusion of the specific antibody or BRM into the patient which activates the sequestered PMNs inducing damage to the vascular endothelium, resulting in capillary leak and ALI [52, 74].",

            "text": "Antibodies implicated in TRALI include those against class I or II HLA and antibodies against HNA [52, 55, 75]. Antibodies to HLA class II antigens have a two-event pathophysiology that differs due to their recognition of these surface antigens on antigen - presenting cells and the in vivo modeling supports the threshold or two-event model [76]. Antibodies to HNA loci, especially HNA-3a, also are postulated to cause TRALI by a two-event pathogenesis as well as inducing TRALI by activating the pulmonary endothelium alone through the CTL-2 receptor [77, 78]. Such direct activation may occur without PMNs and could cause TRALI in neutropenic patients [77]. Other BRMs include soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) which has been shown to prime PMNs and are linked with clinical TRALI [79]. Whether due to antibodies or other BRMs, the majority of TRALI cases are the results of PMN activation inducing pulmonary endothelial damage [52]. Histologically, TRALI is indistinguishable from etiologies of diffuse alveolar damage, which include acute interstitial pneumonia, early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and others [80, 81]. The two pathways by which TRALI may occur are not mutually exclusive and many patients have cognate antigens to transfused antibodies, yet do not develop TRALI, lending credence to a \u201cthreshold\u201d or two- event model [52, 73, 75, 82].",

During the 1990s the UK National Blood Service created a voluntary hemovigilance program, launching the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) and were the first to collect plasma from male donors, after noting that TRALI or probable TRALI was seen almost seven times more frequently with plasma transfusion and about eight times more frequently with platelet infusion, (in comparison to TRALI occurrence in red cells) when these products were collected from female donors [83]. Their efforts were rewarded following the adoption of this collection strategy for platelets and plasma, and reports of TRALI from plasma transfusion fell from 15.5 cases per million units transfused (1999\u20132004) to 3 per million (2005\u20132006) for plasma and from 14 cases per million to just under six cases per million for platelet products [83]. Densmore and colleagues also showed that HLA antibody formation increased with pregnancy, with about 8 % of never-pregnant females showing sensitization, increasing to 15 % of women after one pregnancy, and to about 26 % after three pregnancies [84]. Never-transfused men and never-pregnant women have a 1.7 % prevalence of HLA antibodies [85]. The American Red Cross (ARC) examined their own hemovigilance data and subsequently adopted a similar strategy of collecting plasma from predominantly male donors (95 %) and saw a significant (80 %) decrease in TRALI cases related to plasma infusion [86]. This similar and dramatic decrease in TRALI when female donors were avoided was also shown by Toy and colleagues, who designed a prospective study involving two major academic centers [87].",

Octaplas may be used interchangeably for frozen plasma including in plasma exchange for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) but has its limitations, and besides being more expensive than frozen or thawed plasma products, it may not be used in patients with IgA deficiency or severe deficiency of Protein S.",

Pulmonary wedge pressure is an invasive measurement to determine the back pressure from the heart, or filling (\u201cwedge\u201d) pressure of the left atrium, by a catheter in the pulmonary artery, and unless the patient already has a Swan-Ganz catheter in place it is not likely to be performed. BNP is a 32 amino acid polypeptide secreted in response to stretched cardiac ventricles, to counteract the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system. Baseline BNP is not likely to be measured unless the patient is already being monitored for heart failure and may not be useful unless the differences are marked. In general, two of the most helpful distinguishing features are that TACO responds quickly to diuresis, whereas this approach should be avoided in TRALI unless the patient is also fluid overloaded, and, though fever may or may not be seen with TRALI, it is never a feature of TACO. It may be helpful to sit the patient upright; oxygen should be given as needed. It is possible that TRALI and TACO may occur together .\n",
