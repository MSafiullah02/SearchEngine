In the case of technical/anatomic mishaps, the best way to prevent infection is to correct the anatomic abnormality under coverage of appropriate antimicrobial therapy as antimicrobial treatment alone will not eliminate the risk of developing recurrent infections related to the uncorrected problem. As a consequence, the transplant recipient remains at high risk of subsequent infections with an increased risk of developing antimicrobial resistance until successful correction of the underlying abnormality.1, 2\nBox 1Epidemiologic exposures of importance for the organ transplant recipient\nA.In the community1.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n2.Geographically restricted systemic mycosesBlastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis\n3.\nStrongyloides stercoralis\n4.Respiratory virusesInfluenzaParainfluenzaRespiratory syncytial virusAdenoviruses\n5.Infections acquired by the ingestion of contaminated food/water\nSalmonella species\nCampylobacter jejuni\n\nListeria monocytogenes\n\nGiardia lamblia\n\n6.Environmental fungi (Aspergillus species and others)7.Vector-borne (eg, West Nile virus)\nB.In the hospital1.From the contaminated air\nAspergillus species\nPseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli\n2.From contaminated potable water\nLegionella pneumophila\nOther Legionella species\n3.Unwashed hands of medical personnel\nCandida species (including azole resistant)Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\nVancomycin-resistant enterococciHighly resistant gram-negative bacilli\n\nC.Global travel (selected examples only)1.Gastrointestinal bacterial and viral pathogens\nSalmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio\n\nEscherichia coli (multiple types)Viral gastroenteritis (eg, on cruise ships)\n2.Parasitic infectionsMalariaStrongyloidiasis and other intestinal parasitic diseasesLeishmaniasis\n3.Respiratory infectionsSARS coronavirus\n4.Viral hepatitisHepatitis A, E or hepatitis B for long-term travel or residence\n\n\nBox 2Factors contributing to the net state of immunosuppression in the organ transplant recipient\n1.Dose, duration, and temporal sequence of immunosuppressive therapy2.Neutropenia, lymphocytopenia3.Metabolic abnormalitiesProtein-calorie malnutritionUremiaHyperglycemia\n4.Infection with immunomodulating virusesCytomegalovirusEpstein-Barr virusHuman herpes virus 6Hepatitis B virusHepatitis C virusHuman immunodeficiency virus\n\n",

Although some clinical syndromes, such as pneumonia, can occur at any time point after transplant, the causes may be very different at different time points. Fig. 1\ndelineates the timetable for the onset of infections after organ transplantation in the absence of effective preventative strategies. When preventative antimicrobial therapy fails to completely protect the patient, a common clinical effect is to extend the time period in which the infectious complication will likely appear. For example, in the case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, in the absence of prophylaxis CMV-induced clinical disease is most common 1 to 3 months after transplantation. When prophylaxis is used, but fails, it is common for the disease to occur 4 to 8 months after transplantation (depending on the nature and duration of the prophylaxis and the immunosuppressive regimen).2, 3\n",

The first of these is attributable to a group of viral pathogens that are associated with latent and/or chronic infections. Examples include CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), and the hepatitis viruses (B and C); all of which may cause disease through acquisition of primary infection (typically from the donor) or secondary infection within the recipient under the pressure of immune suppression (secondary infection includes reactivation of latent pathogens and reinfection with a new strain). The second set of pathogens observed in this time period cause so-called opportunistic infections and include organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Pneumocystis jiroveci. Development of infection with these opportunistic pathogens is attributable to the combination of sustained immunosuppression, which is often combined with the immunomodulating effects of viral infection creating a net state of immunosuppression great enough that these opportunistic infections can occur without an especially intensive environmental exposure.",

Accordingly, details regarding infectious complications occurring in this time period may be biased to include more significant infections resulting in hospitalization. Despite this limitation, experience supports dividing individuals with infections during this last time period into 2 main categories: (1) most patients with a good result from transplantation (maintenance immunosuppression, good allograft function) are at greatest risk from typical community-acquired infections (such as influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus); (2) a smaller group of patients with poorer outcomes from transplantation (excessive acute and chronic immunosuppression, poor allograft function, and, often, chronic viral infection). These patients remain at high risk for recurrent infections related to uncorrected mechanical problems as well as opportunistic infections attributable to organisms like Pneumocystis jiroveci, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Nocardia asteroides.",

Bacteremia, which can be partly explained by disruption of the mucosal barrier associated with harvest injury or rejection, is commonly seen.7, 8 Infection of the lower respiratory tract (including pneumonia and lung abscess) is the most common site of infection reported in most, but not all, series of pediatric heart transplant recipients.9, 10, 11, 12 Mediastinitis is another important infection after thoracic transplantation, particularly if re-exploration of the chest is required. Pathogens associated with mediastinitis include S aureus and gram-negative enteric bacilli. Children undergoing lung transplantation because of cystic fibrosis experience a high rate of infectious complications as they often have preexisting colonization with resistant organisms, including Pseudomonas species, Burkholderia species and other bacterial pathogens.13, 14, 15, 16 Given the importance and difficulty in treating these often resistant organisms, transplant centers usually recommend a thorough microbiologic evaluation of heart-lung or lung transplant candidates before transplantation.",

For all of these patients, invasive aspergillosis and other mycoses occur uncommonly. The consequences of invasive aspergillosis and other noncandidal mycoses associated with invasive infections are frequently devastating. Lung transplant recipients are unique in that they experience proportionately more infections with Aspergillus species compared with other organ recipients. These infections are often seen in children undergoing transplantation as treatment of cystic fibrosis and reflect infection with Aspergillus that was present in the recipient before transplantation.

The interpretation of serologic results is further confused by the potential presence of passive antibody from blood products provided during or after the transplant procedure. In addition, the altered immune responses after transplantation might impair the patient's ability to mount predictable humoral responses. Viral culture of blood for CMV has limited clinical usefulness for diagnosis of disease caused by poor sensitivity. There is no role for CMV urine culture in the diagnosis of disease caused by poor specificity.26 A positive culture from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may not correlate with disease.27, 28 The presence of a positive measurement of CMV load in the peripheral blood (measured by either nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT) or pp65 antigenemia assay) in a patient with a compatible CMV clinical syndrome is strongly suggestive of CMV disease. However, the CMV load may be positive before the onset or in the absence of clinical disease and may be seen in the presence of disease from other causes. Further, the CMV load in the peripheral blood may be negative in some patients with tissue invasive disease, especially CMV involving the gastrointestinal tract. Given the variable usefulness of these tests, histopathologic examination of involved organs is essential to confirm the presence of CMV when the diagnosis of invasive CMV disease is being considered.",

Currently, when antiviral agents are used to treat EBV, the agent of choice is ganciclovir, as in vitro it is 10 times more active against EBV compared with acyclovir. The controversy on the use of these agents for EBV/PTLD arises because although these agents can suppress EBV lytic infection, they seem to be of limited value in treatment nonlytic EBV proliferation, which is believed to be the dominant component of EBV-related PTLD. Increasing evidence (albeit anecdotal) supports the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal rituximab in the treatment of EBV disease and PTLD. However, the optimal timing and treatment strategy for this agent remain to be defined.

However, this conclusion is primarily based on a retrospective review of historical experience and the agent is not approved for this indication by the US Food and Drug Administration or similar agencies.

A guideline on vaccinations for the transplant candidate/patient has recently been published.73 In some situations, accelerated vaccination schedules may be used for selected vaccines. Given differences in childhood vaccination schedules in different jurisdictions, clinicians should acquaint themselves with the appropriate schedules and the circumstances under which accelerated schedules could be used. When using vaccines after transplantation, one needs to be concerned about safety as well as efficacy. In general, all live virus vaccines should be avoided in the transplant recipient. The oral polio, yellow fever, and oral typhoid vaccines are live and are contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients. The live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine is also contraindicated. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines are somewhat contraindicated and their use should be limited to outbreak scenarios. The varicella vaccine is also somewhat contraindicated and is not approved for use in transplant patents. Although limited published data support the potential use of this vaccine in transplant recipients,72 most experts continue to advise against this practice. In the cases of the nonlive vaccines, the major concern is not safety, but efficacy. Thus, in general, it is advisable to give nonlive vaccines at times when the level of immunosuppression would allow for immunogenicity. Table 3\nsummarizes the vaccines that are indicated and contraindicated in transplant recipients. Given the relative burden and importance of invasive pneumococcal disease in pediatric transplant recipients, the importance of pneumococcal vaccination should not be underestimated.17, 63, 69\n",

            "text": "The organ donor is a frequent source of exposure to pathogens in the organ transplant recipient. Accordingly, screening of the donor organ is a crucial aspect of the preventive strategies aimed at minimizing adverse outcomes from infections in the posttransplant period. Despite a long-standing recognition of the importance of donor-derived infections, increased concern about this problem has emerged because of recent donor-related transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This case, as well as concerns about the lack of sensitivity of serologic testing and the relatively long time period until seroconversion against HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), have led to interest in the use of NAT-based testing for the pathogens HIV, HCV, and HBV. Although arguments exist for and against the use of NAT testing, a final international consensus addressing if and when to use these tests is only beginning to emerge.74 Decisions relating to the use of such tests must consider not only the reliability of this technology but also the feasibility of universal implementation of these testing procedures for all procurement organizations. Recent cases of donor-associated transmission of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and West Nile virus have also raised questions on whether the panel of routine tests performed on potential donors should be expanded to include these and other potential donor-derived pathogens. To date, a consensus has not been reached on whether or not screening against these pathogens should be routinely included in donor testing panels. It is to be hoped that the implementation of working groups and committees focusing on the problem of donor-derived infections in North America and Europe will lead to improved data to better inform subsequent recommendations regarding donor testing. Current requirements for screening of nonliving donors are shown in Table 4\n. At present, no specific requirements have been implemented for screening of live donors. In general, testing strategies that are in place for deceased donors are applied to the use of these organs. The importance of documenting the presence of potential donor-transmissible pathogens is imperative not only to inform decision making regarding the use of potential donor organs but also because results of donor testing can inform specific preventative strategies even when donor-associated exposure to pathogens is unavoidable.",

Although there are common basic principles, the specific regimens vary across centers and by the type of organ transplanted. For most patients, the major targets of prophylaxis are bacterial pathogens, herpes group viruses, and fungal pathogens, including pneumocystis. Perioperative antibiotics are typically used for 48 to 72 hours to provide prophylaxis against surgical contamination. The burden of CMV infection in transplant patients is such that it represents the major focus of prevention in the posttransplant period, when intravenous ganciclovir is usually used with or without CMV hyperimmune globulin in selected patient groups.

For example, as discussed earlier, the most likely causes of infection within the first month after transplantation are often bacterial or candidal and are largely similar to what is seen in nonimmunosuppressed patients who have undergone comparable surgery.
