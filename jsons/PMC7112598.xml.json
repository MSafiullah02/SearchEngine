            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases of swine. This disease was first detected in the U.S. in 1987 (Keffaber, 1989) and in Europe in 1990 (Wensvoort et al., 1991). The etiologic agent for this disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the Arteriviridae family, order Nidovirales. The full-length genomic sequence has been determined for PRRSV isolates of both European and North American lineage (Allende et al., 1999, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Nelsen et al., 1999, Shen et al., 2000, Wootton et al., 2000). Molecular analysis of the prototype PRRSV VR-2332 and Lelystad strains (U.S. and European isolates, respectively) has suggested that divergently evolved strains emerged on two continents almost simultaneously, perhaps due to similar changes in swine management practices (Murtaugh et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999). Analysis of partial genomic sequence data for hundreds of PRRSV strains reveals extensive diversity but also well-conserved regions (Andreyev et al., 1997, Meng et al., 1995; reviewed by Meng, 2000).",

            "text": "Disease caused by PRRSV is characterized by severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease and reproductive failure. Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial pathogens as well as other viral pathogens (Benfield et al., 1992) and PRRSV is a key etiologic agent of the economically important porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). The most consistent pathological lesions caused by PRRSV during acute infection are interstitial pneumonia and mild lymphocytic encephalitis (Halbur et al., 1995, Plagemann, 1996, Rossow et al., 1995, Rossow et al., 1996). Tissue macrophages and monocytes are the major target cells during both acute and persistent infection (Molitor et al., 1997), although pneumocytes and epithelial germ cells of the testes have also been shown to be infected (Sur et al., 1996, Sur et al., 1997). It is important to note that clinical disease caused by PRRSV is highly variable, ranging from mild, subclinical infections to acute deaths of adult animals (Zimmerman et al., 1997). The differences in virulence have been attributed to numerous factors including host genetics, management practices, and virus strain heterogeneity (Halbur et al., 1995, Halbur et al., 1996, Halbur et al., 1998, Keffaber, 1989, Wensvoort, 1993). After the acute phase of PRRSV infection, which is typically characterized by viremia and clinical disease, many pigs fully recover yet carry a low-level viral infection for an extended period of time. Under experimental conditions, persistent infection with PRRSV has been well documented (Albina et al., 1994, Allende et al., 2000, Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995, Horter et al., 2002, Sur et al., 1996, Yoon et al., 1993, Wills et al., 2003). These \u201ccarrier\u201d pigs are persistently infected with PRRSV and shed the virus, either intermittently or continuously, and may infect na\u00efve pigs following direct or indirect contact. Most notably, infectious virus has been recovered for up to 157 days post-infection (Wills et al., 1997).",

The innate immune response, of which type I IFN is a major component, plays a key role in establishment of an effective adaptive immune response. The type I IFN response serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response through multiple mechanisms (reviewed by Biron, 1998). Type I IFN: (i) promotes the development of CD8+ T cell response (reviewed by Boehm et al., 1997), (ii) regulates the expression of many proteins responsible for generating antigenic peptides to be displayed in association with MHC class I (reviewed by York and Rock, 1996), (iii) enhances differentiation of dendritic antigen-presenting cells (Luft et al., 1998), (iv) stimulates the division of memory T cells by inducing IL-15 (Tough et al., 1999), (v) contributes to prolonging the lifespan of activated T cells (Marrack et al., 1999), and (vi) enhances IgG production and down-regulates IgE secretion in B cells (Finkelman et al., 1990, Finkelman et al., 1991).",

            "text": "In addition to a role in the establishment of an adaptive immune response, type I IFN also plays an important role in innate host defenses against viral infection. Type I IFN has been shown to activate or induce the synthesis of several proteins including 2,5-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), Mx and ribonuclease L (RNase L) (Vilcek and Sen, 1996), all of which result in induction of an antiviral state (reviewed by Samuel, 2001). Not surprisingly, many viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to counteract the IFN response. For example, the hepatitis B virus ORF-C product and terminal protein (Whitten et al., 1991), the human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E6 and E7 proteins (Park et al., 2000, Ronco et al., 1998), and the influenza A virus NS1 protein (Talon et al., 2000) are viral proteins that have been shown to inhibit IFN synthesis. Some viral proteins, such as the adenoviral E1A (Zhang et al., 1996), Sendai virus C proteins (Komatsu et al., 2000) and Simian Virus 5 protein V (Didcock et al., 1999), block IFN signaling via the Jak-STAT pathways. Additionally, Herpes virus, SV40 and EMCV are known to block IFN-induction of the 2,5-OAS/RNase L system (Vilcek and Sen, 1996).",

In this study, North American PRRSV field isolates were evaluated with respect to induction, sensitivity and suppression of an in vitro IFN response in PAM cultures. Our results show that these isolates are sensitive to rIFN-\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner, but are generally poor inducers of IFN in vitro. Notably the extent of the sensitivity and induction of IFN not only differed between PRRSV isolates, but also showed variation among the plaque-derived populations within each isolate. Two of the field isolates studied were able to suppress the IFN-\u03b1 production of cells dually-treated with polyI:C and a third North American PRRSV isolate. While considerable variation was noted for the levels of IFN-\u03b1 measured between replicates, most likely due to the variability of alveolar macrophage function among pigs (du Manoir et al., 2002), the trends observed were consistent between experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrate that North American PRRSV isolates differ in the ability to induce or suppress IFN-\u03b1, which may contribute to both virulence differences commonly observed among PRRSV infections and the failure of PRRSV infection to consistently induce a rapid and robust sterilizing immune response.",

In the present study, it was demonstrated that North American PRRSV isolates were sensitive to rIFN-\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner and were poor IFN-\u03b1 inducers in vitro. These results are consistent with previous studies using European PRRSV isolates (Albina et al., 1998a, Buddaert et al., 1998, van Reeth et al., 1999). Similar to results with type I IFN, North American PRRSV replication was also blocked by a type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) and virus replication was restored by the addition of 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor of PKR (Rowland et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Biological, antigenic, pathogenic, and genetic variation among PRRSV field isolates has been well documented (reviewed by Meng, 2000). The data presented herein demonstrated that North American PRRSV field isolates were differentially sensitive to the in vitro antiviral effects of rIFN-\u03b1 and the use of plaque-derived populations from these field isolates demonstrated that closely related variants of PRRSV may differ in their IFN responses. Similarly, it has been shown that the sensitivity of reovirus, hepatitis C virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to type I IFN antiviral activity differs among viral strains (Enomoto et al., 1996, Moskophidis et al., 1994; reviewed by Samuel, 1998). A previous study suggested that significant differences of IFN-inducing capabilities could be a quasispecies marker of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Marcus et al., 1998). In contrast to the results presented herein, a study using the European PRRSV strains SDRPI and SDRPII found no strain differences in IFN-\u03b1 sensitivity or induction, despite differences in clinical virulence (Albina et al., 1998a). Previous experimental work has demonstrated evidence of a relationship between IFN phenotypes and virulence for other viruses. For example, virulent measles virus induces lower levels of IFN than attenuated strains and IFN-resistant strains can establish persistent infections of the central nervous system (Carrigan and Knox, 1990). It has also been shown that the capability of non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus to establish persistent infections in the early fetus is related to its ability to suppress type I IFN synthesis (Charleston et al., 2001). Future in vivo studies will be needed to determine if the IFN phenotypes described in the present study are related to PRRSV virulence or persistence.",

            "text": "In the present study it was shown that polyI:C treatment of PRRSV-infected cells resulted in greatly enhanced IFN-\u03b1 production, especially in PAM cultures infected with PRRSV isolate 3. Similar phenomenons have been reported by other studies. IFN-inducing Listeria monocytogenes (Havell, 1986) and type I IFN pretreatment (Rosztoczy and Megyeri, 1989) enhanced IFN production by polyI:C, Sendai virus, or endotoxin. A plausible mechanism of this enhancement is by positive feedback regulation of type I IFN synthesis, in which a weak IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling contributes to the enhancement of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 synthesis due to the accumulation of transcription factor IRF-7 (reviewed by Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001). This positive feedback loop of IFN synthesis could be efficiently induced by a small amount of IFN-\u03b1 produced during the first 12 h after isolate 3 infection, resulting in amplification of the IFN-\u03b1 response to polyI:C. Consistent with this possibility was the observation that neutralizing antibody against IFN-\u03b1 remarkably reduced IFN-\u03b1 production by polyI:C in cells infected with isolate 3, and that 1 U/ml of rIFN-\u03b1 added to poly I:C treated cells greatly increased the levels of IFN-\u03b1 detected. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) which recognizes polyI:C (Alexopoulou et al., 2001) could be also involved in the enhancement of IFN production. Measles virus strains with IFN-\u03b2 inducing properties up-regulated the expression of TLR3 resulting in enhanced IFN-\u03b2 production in response to polyI:C (Tanabe et al., 2003). Therefore IFN produced by isolate 3 may act through a similar mechanism to up-regulate TLR3 expression followed by increased IFN-\u03b1 production after polyI:C treatment.",

In the present study, the levels of PRRSV IFN induction were typically too low to use in a similarly designed suppression experiment. Therefore the suppressive effect of PRRSV isolates 7 and 12 on IFN-\u03b1 production was evaluated in cells infected with isolate 3 and treated with polyI:C, and significant suppression of IFN-\u03b1 was demonstrated. European PRRSV was also shown to suppress IFN-\u03b1 production by TGEV, both in vitro and in vivo (Albina et al., 1998a). However, this result was not corroborated in vivo by another group using the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Buddaert et al., 1998). Microarray experiments have indicated that polyI:C, IFN and viruses induced different subsets of the same cellular genes by activating diverse signaling pathways (Geiss et al., 2001). Since IFN-\u03b1 production was enhanced by the addition of polyI:C, it is likely that PRRSV isolates 7 and 12 suppress an IFN-\u03b1 synthesis pathway activated by isolate 3 and polyI:C but not polyI:C alone. It has been shown that viruses which are resistant to the effects of IFN or can suppress IFN production have increased opportunities to spread before activation of the adaptive immune response (Moskophidis et al., 1994, Naniche et al., 2000). Mouse models of viral infection have clearly demonstrated that disrupting the IFN response leads to higher levels of viral replication. Mice deficient in an IFN receptor exhibited increased susceptibility to LCMV (van den Broek et al., 1995) and extensive spread of LCMV infection correlated with an isolate's relative resistance to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Moskophidis et al., 1994).",

Many viruses prevent mRNA synthesis of IFN-\u03b1 through various mechanisms but VSV inhibits IFN-\u03b1 synthesis by shutting down the host protein synthesis (Ahmed et al., 2003). The present study showed that PRRSV stimulated IFN-\u03b1 mRNA synthesis but inhibited IFN-\u03b1 protein expression. This result suggests that the mechanism by which PRRSV isolates suppress IFN-\u03b1 production is mediated by generally inhibiting host protein expression or by specifically inhibiting IFN-\u03b1 protein expression. Half-life times of IFN mRNA and protein could be different and that might be responsible for differences between mRNA and protein levels of IFN. However, increases in IFN-\u03b1 mRNA expression for PRRSV infected PAM cultures were consistently detected at multiple times post-infection, yet for cells infected with isolate 7 or 12 very low to undetectable levels of IFN-\u03b1 protein were typically observed at all times p.i. Thus, although the mechanisms of IFN-\u03b1 suppression by PRRSV remain to be elucidated, data presented herein show that it is likely to be post-transcriptional in nature.",

Specific evidence of this includes a slow neutralizing antibody response, which is typically not detected until 3 weeks p.i. (Albina et al., 1998b) and does not reach maximum levels until 10\u201318 weeks p.i. (Nelson et al., 1994, Yoon et al., 1995). Wide variation has been shown in individual animals, with some studies demonstrating that many infected animals fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response (Loemba et al., 1996, Nelson et al., 1994). While the importance of a cell-mediated response for protection against PRRSV has not been debated, the effectiveness of this response during the early phases of disease also appears to be suboptimal (reviewed by Murtaugh et al., 2002). For example, the T-cell response to PRRSV is weak and transient and cannot be restimulated for more than 4 weeks post-challenge (Meier et al., 2000, Molitor et al., 1997). Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 responses of PRRSV-infected pigs were relatively weak and increased slowly in comparison to pseudorabies virus infected pigs (Meier et al., 2003). Although the precise mechanisms for the ineffective nature of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV is not known, PRRSV evasion of the innate immune responses, such as the type I IFN response, may set the stage for subsequent subversion of the adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrates that North American PRRSV field isolates are distinctively different in their in vitro IFN phenotypes, a difference that could contribute to the variable clinical signs and pathology observed in PRRSV infections. Moreover, the lack of IFN response following infection with PRRSV could be involved in the establishment of persistent infections or secondary bacterial and viral infection, both of which are characteristic of PRRSV infections in swine. However, in vivo studies are required to fully define the role of type I IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis and virulence. The mechanisms involved in enhancement of IFN-\u03b1 by PRRSV infected and polyI:C treated cells remains to be elucidated. Additionally, it will be important to determine whether PRRSV generally inhibits host protein synthesis or specifically down-regulates IFN expression and to identify the viral proteins that contribute to the different IFN response among PRRSV isolates. Knowledge about the role of IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis will provide new hypotheses for improved vaccines or methods to modulate the immune response in order to more effectively control PRRSV infection.",
