If this number does not seem impressive, families in the United States adopted more than 210,000 children of foreign origin since 1989. Also striking is that, since 1990, the number of international adoptions in the United States has increased by more than 320% (Figure 1 ). 1 Internationally adopted children originate from countries that unfortunately are often poor, developing, or war torn. Their governments are often poorly equipped to manage the number of orphaned or abandoned children. As a result, they allow individuals from foreign countries to adopt these children. Owing to changing economic, political, and social climates around the world, policies pertaining to foreign adoption in these countries are constantly changing. As a result, a country may have a liberal foreign adoption policy or high quota one year, but it may close its doors to adoption the next. Figure  2 highlights the effect of these changes on the origins of adopted children who were brought into the United States over the past decade. At present, more than 70% of internationally adopted children brought to the United States are from China, Russia, and Guatemala. 1 The emergence of a disease or a medical condition sometimes overshadows the joy of bringing a new child into a family. Family members traveling to a foreign country to complete an adoption are at risk for acquiring infectious diseases in that country. All too often, travelers, nontraveling family members, and other contacts are at risk for acquiring an infectious process because appropriate safeguards are not followed or considered. Two published reports highlight the potential health risks associated with international adoption. 2, 3 Because of the devastation these diseases can cause and because of the ease with which many can be spread, health care practitioners must be familiar with medical obstacles associated with international adoptions. In addition, since many of these diseases can easily be prevented with vaccination, prophylaxis, and/or education, the pharmacist can play an integral part in minimizing the health risks of the families involved in these adoptions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 293, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1173, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1712, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1714, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 288, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 896, "end": 905, "text": "Figure  2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Internationally adopted children often enter the United States without a caregiver who is familiar with their medical history, vaccination status, or social experiences.

In contrast, documentation of medical records is excellent for children from Korea because of government-controlled adoption agencies. 6 Documentation from other countries, such as China or Russia, is highly variable. 6 In addition to confusion and uncertainty pertaining to diagnostic and medical terminology, adoptive parents and their medical consultants must be vigilant for errors in medical diagnoses and vaccination schedules in the medical records. Examples of such errors are vaccinations that were apparently administered before the birth date of the adopted child. Records that appear perfect, such as vaccinations given exactly 1-2 months apart, are often modified to align with current immunization schedules in the United States. 6 In addition, descriptions of child development should be accepted cautiously.

The incidence in Africa is 345 cases of tuberculosis/100,000 people, whereas in Southeast Asia it is 190 cases/100,000. In contrast, the incidence of tuberculosis in the Americas is approximately 43 cases/100,000 people. 18 Another consideration is that the worldwide occurrence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is increasing. According to the World Health Organization, more than 300,000 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have been reported. 19 Between 1994 and 2000, almost every country the World Health Organization surveyed had documented cases. 20 Of all cases of tuberculosis in the United States, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis caused 1.2%. Multidrugresistant tuberculosis is most problematic in China, eastern Europe, and Russia. Rates of resistance in Russia and eastern Europe are 6.5-14%, whereas rates in China range from 1.4% in Hong Kong to 10.8% in the Henan province. 21 In 1999, a report described a 9-year-old child adopted from the Marshall Islands who had a diagnosis of extensive, bilateral, cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis. 22 This child was not screened for tuberculosis before entering the United States. As a result, he transmitted M. tuberculosis to 20% of his direct contacts in rural North Dakota. Although active tuberculosis is infrequently reported among immigrant children, internationally adopted children are more likely than domestically adopted children to have active tuberculosis. The rate of tuberculosis among internationally adopted children is 50-150 times that among the general population of the United States. 6 Latent tuberculosis is more common among internationally adopted children than active tuberculosis. Tuberculosis skin tests were positive in approximately 0.6-5% of internationally adopted children. 17, 23 Children who resided in orphanages had rates of latent tuberculosis higher than those of children who were raised in foster homes. 23 A study of 404 international adoptees revealed that 75 (19%) who were screened with tuberculin skin testing were given a diagnosis of latent tuberculosis. 24 Of note, the high rate of positive results among internationally adopted children may be due to not only exposure to active cases of tuberculosis in their countries of origin but also vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine, which is more common in developing countries than in the United States.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 145, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 216, "end": 218, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 344, "end": 346, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 672, "end": 674, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 900, "end": 902, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1010, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1360, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1522, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2030, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2233, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2236, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2370, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2528, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tuberculosis"}, {"text": "Routine screening for tuberculosis in internationally adopted children should include a tuberculin skin test administered by using the Mantoux method. 6, 9, 22, 25 Testing should be performed regardless of the child's history of receiving the BCG vaccine. 22 Although the reaction to a tuberculin skin test due to the BCG vaccine cannot be distinguished from the reaction due to latent tuberculosis, immunity secondary to the BCG vaccine wanes over time. A health care professional should review the results 48-72 hours after the tuberculin skin test is performed. Indurations of at least 10 mm should be considered positive in a healthy child. In a child infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), indurations of 5 mm or larger require further evaluation. 6 Skin testing should be repeated after 6 months in children in whom an induration of smaller than 10 mm is elicited. This recommendation is based on the fact that children may not respond to the test because of other illness, malnutrition, or recent infection with tuberculosis without time to mount an adequate immune response. 9, 26 In children with a positive tuberculin skin-test result, chest radiography and full physical examination should be performed to determine if they have active tuberculosis. Also, in newborns with a recent history of BCG immunization, chest radiography and a tuberculin skin test should be done 1 year after vaccination. 6, 9 For the treatment of a child with active tuberculosis, physicians should select an antituberculosis regimen based on resistance patterns from the adopted child's country of origin. Recommended treatment for active tuberculosis includes 6 months of therapy: isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, then isoniazid and rifampin given for the last 4 months.

When the history of hepatitis vaccination is questionable or missing, children should receive the three-dose hepatitis B vaccination series. Immunization does not harm a child with an active hepatitis B infection and may help a child with incubating disease avoid chronic disease. 9 The risk of transmitting hepatitis B to household members is well documented, albeit low. 17, [31] [32] [33] Families of children adopted from Asia with documented hepatitis B infection had a 9% occurrence of subsequent hepatitis B infection compared with a 2% risk in a control population. 31 Household members of any child with a positive HBsAg result should be vaccinated if they have not completed the vaccination series. 9 Specific recommendations to guide therapy for children with acute hepatitis B infection are not readily available. 28 Lamivudine decreased serum DNA levels of hepatitis B virus to below the limit of the research assay at the end of a 52-week trial (23% vs 13% with placebo) in children with chronic hepatitis B. 34 Interferon-alfa was relatively ineffective for chronic infections acquired during childhood.

Transmission of the SARS virus from an internationally adopted child to a prospective parent or other family member is possible; however, such a case has not been reported.
