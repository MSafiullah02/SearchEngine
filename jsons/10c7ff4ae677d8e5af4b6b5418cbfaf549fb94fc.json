Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion in the presence of suggestive symptoms, since other infecting viruses such as respiratory syncytial viruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, or coronaviruses may induce similar clinical pictures con rmation. Diagnosis is based on the detection of virus-speci c RNA using nucleic acid ampli cation techniques from a respiratory sample such as a nasopharyngeal swab. is technique has been a breakthrough in the diagnosis as it could decrease unnecessary use of empirical antibiotic therapy. Other diagnostic methods are viral culture, usually less available and with longer turnaround time results, and direct viral detection in respiratory secretions by immuno uorescence or enzyme immunoassay, which shows lower sensitivity and speci city than PCR. Currently, there is no speci c treatment against parain uenza virus infections. Management of the infected patient is based on supportive therapy according to the clinical condition. e main limitation of our case report is the uncon rmed etiological presence of parain uenza virus in pericardial e usion.
