Three reviewers [C.M.W., J.D.A., M.C.M.] watched the videotapes and independently assessed use of PPE and elapsed time to specific resuscitation maneuvers, and then discussion occurred until consensus was achieved. PPE adherence was defined as the visual confirmation by reviewer consensus of both the appropriate PPE selection and correct use in agreement with CDC guidance on proper donning techniques, although the adequacy of the respirator seal could not be further qualitatively tested in real time because of the observational nature of the simulations.15\n",

This model is corroborated by additional findings from the SARS outbreak that consistent HCW adherence to recommended barrier precautions was most closely associated with recent infection control training and personal experience with a confirmed case.20., 21. Building on this self-protective behavior model, the CDC and WHO both subsequently released guidance on influenza prevention strategies recommending routine use of both standard and droplet precautions, with the added use of enhanced precautions to include N95 respirators during high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures.22., 23.

Unfortunately, during the SARS outbreak, expanded PPE requirements were found to limit the ability of the first responder to enter the room rapidly during an acute event.14 This delay effect, due to donning of PPE, was reproduced in a study of first responders which demonstrated improved time to intervention through use of modified gowns with pre-tied neck straps and front-tying waist straps.24 During the SARS outbreak, the delay effect led to the proposal of a protocol for modified PPE requirements for the first responder until further HCWs in full PPE arrived. Subsequent study of ED staff during a simulated resuscitation scenario also demonstrated subjective impairment in assessment abilities and task performance when wearing enhanced PPE as compared to without PPE, although objective measure data, which did not include the time taken to don PPE, were similar.25 Such subjective impairment, particularly in communication, was also reported by staff in our own study among those wearing PAPRs as compared with N95 respirators.",

In contrast to all other simulations, however, the delay effect was observed in the only simulation in which the first responders electively donned PAPRs before entry. In this setting, the first responders did not enter until 2 minutes, as compared with the median study entry of 0.3 minutes. Thus, although direct comparison of correct use of N95 respirator versus PAPR was not possible because of the low incidence of PAPR use and the observational nature of this study, the utility of any added benefit provided by PAPR usage must be weighed against significant delays and impairment in emergent care delivery.",

As stated, 75% of the staff wore N95 respirators and 84% reported previous fit testing; however, because of the anonymous nature of the survey, previous fit testing could not be correlated with observed appropriate PPE adherence or choice of respirator. One study has demonstrated that without previous fit testing, nearly 50% of providers are able to achieve an adequate seal but that without regular use, there is decay in the ability to achieve an adequate seal over time.27 Although laboratory testing suggests variable, but clearly increased protection, with N95s as compared with surgical masks, the clinical translation of this finding was not observed in a non-inferiority trial of influenza transmission among HCWs.28., 29. Such mixed findings have only fueled unresolved questions as to the role of fit testing and the use of inappropriately donned respirators, particularly in emergency situations under pandemic circumstances.

Restricting nonessential or nonprotected providers during high-risk procedures remains a key strategy to reduce exposure. As such, a more experienced clinician or support staff may best fill this role. Our study suggests that a gatekeeper may improve respirator adherence, and likely gown and eye protection as well. During debriefing, participants stated that after they were aware that the patient was in distress, their priority was to provide rapid care despite knowing the patient was on enhanced precautions. They believed that donning PPE would slow them down. In this study, integrating the gatekeeper role served to protect more providers, with no adverse impact on resuscitation performance. For five of the key measures analyzed, participants for whom room access was controlled by a gatekeeper performed maneuvers on as timely a basis as their counterparts but with markedly better personal protection. Surprisingly, time to providing necessary ventilation support was 1.6 minutes earlier for gatekeeper-controlled groups. This suggests that incorporating the gatekeeper role into a code-response protocol during pandemic influenza or other suspected airborne contagions will not prolong time to critical care provision but perhaps improve it. The gatekeeper effect is likely driven by greater (1) situational awareness resulting from minimal direct patient care responsibilities, (2) familiarity with requisite precautions, and (3) knowledge of strategies for rapid staging, distribution, and donning of PPE. This effect may mitigate the delay effect while ensuring consistent and proper use of PPE, thereby minimizing delayed entry and maximizing opportunities for early resuscitation intervention as well as HCW safety.",

Subsequent to these training sessions, follow-up random mock codes led by the Johns Hopkins Simulation Center staff to test for skill decay and reinforce PPE adherence practices were to be conducted for the duration of the outbreak. Given the relative decline in the attack rate of 2009 H1N1 during summer 2009 and the subsequent distribution of vaccine concurrent with the 2009\u20132010 influenza season, the magnitude of this epidemic ultimately did not require the further implementation of this training strategy. However, we believe that in the setting of another highly contagious infectious outbreak, this plan represents a novel and rapidly deployable strategy to specifically address knowledge and practice gaps in both PPE adherence among HCWs, as well as the first five minutes of pediatric resuscitation. To our knowledge, such a scalable plan with an explicit, dual focus on both PPE adherence and the first five minutes of resuscitation has not been developed or tested previously.",
