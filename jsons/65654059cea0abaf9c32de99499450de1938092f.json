Here we propose a framework to evaluate their suitability in terms of impact on the users, employed technology and governance methods. We illustrate its usage with three applications, and with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines, highlighting their limitations.",

The aim is to track those who come in contact with infected people with the aid of smartphone applications (referred to as apps in this paper). The basic premise behind these apps is that whenever an individual is diagnosed with the coronavirus, every person who had possibly been near that infected individual during the period in which they were contagious is notified and told to either self-quarantine or request COVID-19 testing. Proponents of this approach point out that the apps can help to stop the chain of transmission in order to control the outbreak without the need of a full lockdown.",

In addition, we also analyze the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines [4] , and assess to what extent they comply with our framework. We observe that all the apps have low scores in Governance, and none of them complies with criteria 15, 17 and 19, which are in our view important areas for any digital contact tracing. The EDBP guidelines provide a clause to halt the use of apps once the situation returns to 'normal'. This can be seen as vague, since 'normal' is open to interpretation considering the socio-economic changes lockdowns brought. A more clear date, unless further action is taken, would be preferred. The EDPB guidelines also require criterion 19, but they do not include any requirement regarding geotagging (relevant for criterion 17). It is also important to remark the importance of using a decentralized protocol (criterion 7), a feature which is not exhibited by the NHS COVID-19 app and it is not required by the EDPB guidelines, while TraceTogether only partly complies with it through a mixed centralized/decentralized protocol. We believe that this approach should be implemented in any digital contact-tracing app, in order to fully ensure the safety of citizen data.",
