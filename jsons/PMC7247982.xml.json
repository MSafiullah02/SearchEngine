Potential explanations include the immune suppression caused by the malignancy and the use of systemic anticancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy [2]. Current data on COVID-19 mortality among cancer patients group treatment modalities such as immune therapy and targeted therapy (n\n = 7) together, which is flawed [3]. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer patients is safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that ICIs may enhance the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 [4]. This issue is complicated by the treatment of immune-mediated toxicities with immunosuppressive steroids. For these reasons, guidelines have suggested to proceed with caution or avoid/interrupt treatment [5], [6]. Here we describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes for four COVID-19-positive patients with genitourinary (GU) cancer treated with ICIs.",

The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and started on intravenous co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin and nasal high-flow oxygen therapy. After an initial increase in oxygen requirement (up to 60 l) the patient showed signs of improvement 48 h later and was successfully weaned off oxygen therapy.
