Consequently, antigen processing in macrophages is impaired due to the increase in pH. CQ and HCQ inhibit the pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IFN-\u03b3, intracellular Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 and downregulate TLR-mediated signal transduction [6, 11, 12] . Another aspect of antimalarials is the reduction of autoimmunity by the up-regulation of apoptosis and the elimination of autoreactive lymphocytes [11] . HCQ and CQ have been shown to show antiviral activity by inhibiting receptor binding and membrane fusion, which play a role in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell [10, 11] . Moreover, the replication of the virus is blocked due to the change in pH required for lysosome and enzyme activities. Due to the mechanisms of action of these drugs, overactivation of the immune system triggered by SARS-CoV-2 may be suppressed and the progression to severe disease may be slowed [6] . In addition, it is suggested that CQ and HCQ could potentially be beneficial, also with low cost, wide use worldwide including rheumatic disease and lower side effect profile [10, 11] . Inhibition of the virus in cells treated with CQ before or after infection suggested that CQ is both prophylactic and therapeutically advantageous. However, there is no evidence of prophylactic use in guidelines. CQ has also been used worldwide for malaria treatment and prophylaxis over the years, and CQ has been shown to inhibit coronavirus replication [8, 14] .",

            "text": "Malaria is one of the most devastating parasitic disease faced by humanity across the world and remains a crucial public health challenge mostly in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world especially Africa, Asia, Europe, America. WHO took the initiative to eradicate malaria across the world between and reduced malaria transmission and even eliminated. Many associations have taken remarkable steps and more than 100 countries have eliminated malaria in the past century. To date, many countries have developed national elimination goals, regional networks to eliminate malaria and elimination strategies were implemented [15] . The major strategies for the prevention of malaria mainly rely on vector control management to reduce the risk of vector-human contact and disease management through early detection methods and chemoprevention. Aryl amino alcohol compounds (such as quinine, chloroquine, lumefantrine, etc.), antifolate compounds (such as pyrimethamine, proguanil, etc.) and artemisinin compounds (such as artemisinin, artesunate, etc.) are common antimalarial drugs for malaria treatment [18] . Amodiaquine, CQ, and primaquine (PQ) were the main components of presumptive, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria treatment [19, 20] . CQ had been the main component of Plasmodium falciparum until CQ resistance was first identified [21] Despite reduced use, CQ use maintained for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria until 2000 [21] . HCQ has been reported to be less active and less toxic to Plasmodium falciparum malaria than CQ [8] . Plasmodium vivax treatment was recommended to be continued by the use of CQ (25 mg/kg over 3 days) + PQ (0.25 mg/kg) for 14 days. For P. falciparum treatment, oral Quinine (QN) + tetracycline or doxycycline was recommended when the treatment with CQ and AS + SP failed. However, a single dose of CQ was no longer recommended for presumptive treatment.",

This is followed by the use of CQ again and CQ is still commonly used in the treatment of febrile illness children [23] . For long term chemoprophylaxis, 5 mg/kg body weight (up to 250 mg) weekly mefloquine is recommended to be continued two weeks before, during, and four weeks after departure from the area [24] .
