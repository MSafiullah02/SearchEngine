Simultaneously, bacteria from clinical and non-clinical settings have been becoming increasingly resistant to conventional antibiotics. Especially, the report about New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), a new \u201cresistance gene\u201d, published by Kumarasamy et al. in 2010 [4] caused an unprecedented world-wide panic. Therefore, the development of breakthrough antimicrobial methodologies including medical drugs, fungicides and bactericidal materials, is becoming a central concern in many scientific fields.",

            "text": "Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted widespread attention as an antimicrobial semiconductor photocatalyst because it is regarded as environmentally friendly, while at the same time possessing strong bactericidal properties. This activity is associated with the strong oxidizing power of TiO2 when it is exposed to UV light with wavelengths of less than 385 nm. When exposed to near-UV light, TiO2 can generate a hole-excited electron pair due to band gap excitation on its surface [5]. Through the combined action of superoxide radicals (O2\n\u2022\n\u2212) produced by the reduction of oxygen with an excited electron, hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022) produced by the oxidation of water and photo-generated electrons/holes, most organic compounds can be decomposed and mineralized to CO2 and H2O [6], [7], [8], [9]. As the single most important effect of TiO2 photocatalysis, its bactericidal activity has been studied in various microorganisms including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), as well as in fungi. In addition, the mechanism of this antimicrobial photocatalysis has been revealed as the loss of cell membrane integrity caused by electrons/holes or by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10], [11], [12]. While photocatalysis for water and air purification has been scientifically studied for more than two decades, and the bactericidal activity of TiO2 photocatalysts is thus well known, in-depth studies of selective applications of TiO2 photocatalysts are still required.",

Therefore, many methods of immobilizing TiO2 nano-particles onto different substrate materials have been tested; these include magnetron sputtering [13], chemical vapor deposition [14], and sol\u2013gel processes [15]. Typically, TiO2-coated medical devices and equipment such as catheters [10], [16], lancets [17] and surgical masks [18] have been developed with a view to self-sterilization functionality to aid in the reduction of nosocomial infections. Highly porous ceramic foams including porous alumina [19], porous silica [20], activated carbon [21], as well as nickel foam [22], have been chosen as substrates for photocatalytic water and air purification and disinfection systems. Although numerous studies have proposed different application modes for photocatalyst-immobilized porous materials, further technological breakthroughs to realize higher-quality products are required for high-grade practical applications.",

The test was carried out in a 500-ml sealed acrylic container by monitoring the concentrations of acetaldehyde and CO2, a decomposition product, under UV light illumination. The foam sample was put into the sealed container, and then 5 ml of standard acetaldehyde gas (1%, balanced by N2; Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was injected into the container. By adsorption onto the foam, the acetaldehyde in the container decreased by approximately 30 ppmv (parts per million by volume) before UV illumination. The oxidative reaction of the gaseous acetaldehyde was implemented by a UV-LED lamp (NCSU003A(T)\u03bb\n(p)\n = 365 nm; Nichia, Tokushima, Japan) illuminating the foam sample at 50 mW cm\u22122 of light intensity through a quartz window. The illumination was initiated when the adsorption equilibrium of gaseous acetaldehyde onto the foam was reached. Meanwhile, gas concentrations were monitored by using an Innova photo-acoustic field gas monitor (Model 1412; Innova Air Tech Instruments, Denmark). Bare cordierite foam was used for the control.",

The optical layer consisted of small TiO2 platelets with smooth surfaces exhibiting a roughly average thickness of 10\u201320 \u03bcm, separated by deep cracks [Fig. 3(a\u2013c)]. The cracks may have formed during or after the heat treatment due to the difference in heat dissipation between the cordierite substrate and the TiO2 coating. These multiple microscopic cracks were expected to relieve the stress when the coated foams were struck. By comparison, bare cordierite foam exhibits a rough surface with many microscopic pores, as shown in Fig. 3(d\u2013f). We considered that these microscopic pores might enhance the adhesive strength of the TiO2 coating layer onto the bare cordierite foam. Up to now, a large number of papers on TiO2 photocatalytic reactions have stressed that photocatalytic activity depends on the dose of TiO2, the UV light intensity for irradiation, and the irradiation time. Yu et al. verified that photocatalytic efficiency strongly depends on the surface structure of the TiO2 thin films prepared by the sol\u2013gel method [26]. They proposed that the aggregation and growth of TiO2 particles in the interior region of thick films which undergo long-term heat treatment leads to a decrease in the number of active surface sites. Thus, improving the crystalline mesoparticles of TiO2 on the cordierite foam frame serves to increase its bactericidal activity and the purification performance of air-cleaning filters.",

This characteristic does not fundamentally change in a 1/500 NB solution which contains a small amount of organic matter and NaCl. In 1999, Janusz et al. reported a surface measurement of about \u221211 mV for TiO2 in a very low-concentration NaCl solution [27]. Meanwhile, bacterial cells also have a negative surface potential in conditions with a pH value over 4. Therefore, it can be inferred that bacterial cells may not be strongly adsorbed onto a TiO2 thin film covering a cordierite foam frame in a neutral pH environment without UV-A irradiation. The thus adsorbed bacteria actually consist of microorganisms contained in a physically adsorbed 1/500 NB aqueous film. We estimated that the amount of adsorbed E. coli on the surface of the \u201csemi-dry\u201d foam depends on the thickness of the liquid film covering the foam frame. This phenomenon is similar to the film formation achieved with the spin coating method described by Brinker et al. in 1990 [28]: that is, the thickness of the liquid film is determined mainly by centrifugation speed, centrifugation time and the viscosity of the liquid while the initial liquid amount remains constant. The description is defined with the following well-known equation:(1)h=h01+(4\u03c1\u03c93h02t/3\u03b7)\n",

However, when the liquid density and viscosity, as well as the centrifugation time are extremely small, such as a 1/500 NB solution and 60 s, the centrifugation speed plays a decisive role. Obviously, the complete removal of the residual bacterial suspensions filling the holes of the foam and the loading of a sufficient amount of bacterial cells with high reproducibility onto the foam frame are the most important points for the effectiveness of the antimicrobial testing by the methods developed here. The liquid film covering the foam frame is equivalent to the bacterial suspension layer on flat samples prepared in accordance with the standard methods (JIS R 1702 and ISO 27447).

While the water on the foam surface deriving from water vapor via physisorption in an air environment is estimated to be lower than in artificial liquid films, there is no doubt that the bactericidal action of the TiO2/cordierite foam can be mainly attributed to the reduction/oxidation of the adsorbed reactants directly by electrons/holes in the foam.",

In fact, photons from UV-A radiation and visible light up to 670 nm are also able to generate singlet oxygen through type-II photosensitization reactions [29], [30]. However, this decrease in survival cannot be identified as efficacious bactericidal action by JIS or ISO standards. In addition, it also has been noted that damaged DNA can be repaired by some bacteria (e.g. E. coli) in both light and dark environments, by mechanisms commonly referred to as photoreactivation and dark repair [31], [32], [33]. Photocatalysis has been demonstrated to inhibit the repairs attributed to the loss of cell membrane integrity caused by the electrons/holes or by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the leakage of cell contents [12], [34], highlighting the advantage of the application of TiO2/cordierite foam in air disinfection.",

We then incubated them at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. During the incubation, we traced the OD(600) value to observe the growth of the surviving bacteria cells. According to the results shown in Table 1\n, the adsorbed bacteria cells were completely inactivated after 48 h of UV-A irradiation, even though the foam was 10 mm thick. This phenomenon can be attributed to the random refraction of UV-A by the TiO2/cordierite foam.",

As is seen from the data, the bactericidal activity decreased slightly with the second and third use. However, this reduction was only observed with 4 or 8 h of UV-A illumination. After 24 h of UV-A illumination, the bactericidal rates were maintained at 99.99% for the second and third use. This indicates that the TiO2/cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action and reusability. In an aqueous phase, dead or damaged bacterial cells can be washed off the active photocatalytic surface. However, in an air-phase system, the dead cells may have the potential to accumulate and block the photoactive surface. Jacoby et al. observed the mineralization of E. coli cell masses on a TiO2 surface in air with long-term (75 h) UV-A illumination [35]. Therefore, the long-term bactericidal action and reusability of TiO2 coated foam are beneficial in reducing active surface blocking.",

This decontaminating and deodorizing ability was investigated by TiO2 photocatalytic degradation on gaseous organic substrates, as described earlier. The reaction time profiles shown in Fig. 7A indicates that acetaldehyde concentration on TiO2/cordierite foam decreases rapidly, while a simultaneous formation of CO2 is observed. There is no decrease in acetaldehyde levels on the cordierite foam without TiO2 loading, as shown in Fig. 7B. The decomposition rate constant for gaseous acetaldehyde \u2013 that is, k\n1\n = 15.6 [h\u22121] \u2013 was calculated to be in the range of 0\u20130.15 h. The complete oxidation reaction of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) into CO2 and H2O shows that the smoother surface of the foam created in this experiment provides a higher photocatalytic reaction rate. This is very important from the viewpoint of practical applications, because it is known to be one of the principal odor-causing gases in indoor air, particularly in cigarette smoke [36].",

The smooth surface of the novel foam offered strongly photocatalytic bactericidal activity and decomposition performance. When treated by relatively low-intensity UV-A irradiation (0.25 mW cm\u22122) for 24 h, the TiO2-coated cordierite foam reduced by over 99.9% the number of viable cells of three gram-negative strains of bacteria (E. coli, L. pneumophila, K. pneumoniae), and also the gram-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus, all of which are extremely important airborne infectious bacteria. The bactericidal activity assessment was carried out by an original test method developed for the three-dimensional porous structures seen in various ceramic and metal foams. All of the data obtained in this study showed high reproducibility and indicated that the bactericidal test method developed here can trace 5\u20136 log units of decrease in bacterial cells in environmental air and can thus meet the criteria of the JIS and ISO standard test methods. The novel foam also exhibited a high photocatalytic degradation reaction on gaseous acetaldehyde to generate CO2 and H2O. All of these results indicate that TiO2-coated cordierite foam is a promising material for use in air-cleaning filters by virtue of its high bactericidal activity and decontaminating, deodorizing performance for air disinfection and purification.",
