            "text": "Enteritis is one of the most economically important diseases in poultry industry because it directly decreases feed absorption, resulting in growth retardation, impaired feed efficiency, immunosuppression, and sometimes increased mortality due to secondary infection (Hoerr, 1998; Yegani and Korver, 2008) . Genetic improvements in broiler chickens to increase feed conversion have made intestinal health particularly important, because fast-growing broilers have a tendency to be hyperphagic and can be severely affected by decreased feed absorption (Dekich, 1998) . Various factors can adversely affect intestinal health, including microorganisms, suboptimal environments, and feed, because the intestines have an extensive surface that is exposed to the external environment (Smart et al., 1988; Goodwin et al., 1993) . Moreover, the intestines have a delicate and balanced bacterial microenvironment referred to as the microflora that can also be adversely affected by factors such as feed, infectious agents, antibiotics, and the environment (Yegani and Korver, 2008 ). An imbalanced microflora could result in decreased vitamin production, immunosuppression, and increased growth of harmful bacteria in the intestines of chickens (Yegani and Korver, 2008) . Therefore, enteric diseases are a common occurrence in the poultry industry worldwide.",

            "text": "Among various factors affecting intestines, enteric viruses have been a focus of interest because enteritis in broiler chickens can lead to runting-stunting syndrome (RSS; Guy, 1998; Ono et al., 2001; Otto et al., 2006; Nili et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Palade et al., 2011) . Several enteric viruses have been identified in a high proportion of chickens suffering from RSS in the fields using molecular surveys, including chicken astrovirus (CAstV), avian nephritis virus (ANV), chicken parvovirus (ChPV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian rotavirus (AvRV), avian reovirus (ARV), and fowl adenovirus (FAdV; Yu et al., 2001; Otto et al., 2006; Smyth et al., 2009; Hewson et al., 2010; Palade et al., 2011; Canelli et al., 2012) . However, it is usually difficult to isolate enteric viruses in vitro, especially CAstV, AvRV, and ChPV for virus purification; furthermore, the severity of enteritis in experimental infections is less than that of enteritis in the field (Yason and Schat, 1986; Guy, 1998; Songserm et al., 2003; Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004) . Enteric viruses such as CAstV, ANV, AvRV, and ARV are also present in a high proportion of healthy broiler flocks (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008) . Therefore, the exact role of enteric viruses in RSS in chickens has not been clarified.",

Briefly, reaction mixtures with a total volume of 30 \u03bcL contained forward and reverse primers (10 pmol/\u03bcL), 2 \u03bcL DNA template, 2\u00d7 reaction buffer, 1.2 \u03bcL M-MLV RT-polymerase, and distilled water. To amplify CAstV and ANV target genes, RT-PCR was performed using 2 different primer sets described below because of the relatively high possibility of primer template mismatch caused by the high nucleotide (nt) sequence diversity of astroviruses (Tang et al., 2005a; Day et al., 2007) . For simultaneous amplification of CAstV and ANV with the primers TAPG-L1 and R1, the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: one cycle of reverse transcription (50\u00b0C for 30 min), one cycle of initial denaturation (94\u00b0C for 2 min), followed by 40 cycles of amplification (94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s). To amplify genes from CAstV and ANV viruses, the primer sets CAS pol 1F and 1R and ANV pol 1F and 1R were used, respectively. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: one cycle of reverse transcription step (50\u00b0C for 30 min), one cycle of initial denaturation (94\u00b0C for 2 min), followed by 40 cycles of amplification (94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s).

The ANV were divided into 2 subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis of a partial fragment of the ORF1b gene; the sequence divergence between these 2 subgroups was 4%. The capsid gene sequence of astroviruses is quite variable and is closely related to antigenicity (Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002; Tang et al., 2005b) . Human and turkey astroviruses were classified into different serotypes based on amino acid sequence divergences of 95 and 82.8% of the astrovirus capsid gene, respectively (Tang et al., 2005b) . The CAstV and ANV identified in this report were therefore expected to show high nt sequence divergence for the capsid gene and distinct serotypes. Additionally, the presence of CAstV was identified in hatched chicks, strongly indicating vertical transmission of CAstV in broiler chick-ens. This positive result is unlikely to be due to contamination given the distinctness of the nt sequence of this CAstV strain compared with other CAstV strains identified.",

Three ARV detected in this report formed a group distinct from other strains, including strains 1733 and 2408 that are known as pathological ARV strains (Rosenberger et al., 1989 ; Figure 3 ). One FAdV was assigned to serotype 11 by sequence analysis of the hexon gene. Serotype 1 of FAdV is associated with gizzard erosion and enteritis in commercial chicken flocks; furthermore, IBH and gizzard erosions have simultaneously been identified in chickens infected with FAdV serotype 8 (Ono et al., 2001; Okuda et al., 2004) . Severe enteritis and hepatitis without gizzard erosions was observed in the flock infected with FAdV serotype 11. The role of this virus in enteritis is therefore not clear.",

Concomitant infections were identified by a variety of combinations of enteric viruses as well as secondary bacterial and protozoa infections. Given primer template mismatches, the presence of PCR inhibitors in feces, and the lower sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR than quantitative RT-PCR (Das et al., 2009; Otto et al., 2012) , the actual prevalence of enteric viruses in Korean chicken flocks is likely to be higher than what we reported. Although the presence of various enteric viruses was identified in commercial chickens, their exact role was not clear. The roles of these enteric viruses in the pathogenesis of RSS should be evaluated by experimental infection of chickens with individual viruses and various combinations of these viruses.",
