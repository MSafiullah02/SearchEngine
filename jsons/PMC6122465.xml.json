He studied medicine at the Medical School of the University in Athens, where he entered in 1965. He performed his paediatric training at the 2nd Paediatric Department of the University of Athens at \u2018P. & A. Kyriakou\u2019 Childrens Hospital in Athens from 1976 to 1978. In 1979 he completed his PhD entitled \u2018Patient compliance with medical instructions\u2019 under the supervision of Professor Constantinos Papadatos, Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Athens and founder of the 2nd Paediatric Department of the University of Athens at \u2018P. & A. Kyriakou\u2019 Children's Hospital (1). The person, who helped him to establish his career in paediatrics and had catalytic influence on his way of clinical thinking, was Professor Constantinos Sinaniotis, initially consultant paediatrician, and finally clinical director for several years of the 2nd Paediatric Department of the University of Athens.",

This is one of the two central paediatric hospitals of the city of Athens, with a large number of children's attendances and admissions and an incredible variety of medical cases from the whole spectrum of children's pathology. During this period, he was actively involved in the teaching of the medical students of University of Athens, paediatric trainees, nurses and nursing students on the ward. In 2004, he was elected as the clinical director of the 1st Paediatric Department of the \u2018Penteli\u2019 Children's Hospital in Athens, where he worked until 2011. His clinical and educational work at this department was recognised by all his colleagues as state-of-the-art.

His publications in PubMed (2\u20138) represent only a limited part of his rich clinical and educational input in paediatrics. He has also developed a wealth of action in the teaching, writing and translation field of paediatric textbooks (9\u201311). He has been one of the principle reviewers of the Greek paediatric journal \u2018Paidiatriki\u2019, while due to his mastery of Greek language he has been the language editor of several Greek paediatric articles and textbooks, including the book Clinical Paediatrics by Professor Andreas Constantopoulos, Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Athens (12). To date, Dr Myriokefalitakis has advised and supported the Paediatric Virology Study Group (PVSG) and has been member of its academic advisory board. Recently, he was awarded by the PVSG with the \u20182016 Paediatric Virology Award in Paediatrics\u2019 for his exceptional clinical and teaching contribution in the management of paediatric viral infections in Greece.",

In the amphitheater, theoretical knowledge, necessary though, is offered. However, clinical skills are shaped on the ward, inside the patient's room and this is where a successful paediatric teaching should be performed. This principle seems not to have changed over time.

Repeated reminders become tedious, but they are right, and whoever overlooks this, will be exposed. If a physician, experienced or younger, has performed a diagnosis before a thorough medical history and detailed physical examination of the patient, he or she will often fail. In paediatrics, diagnosis rarely is established with the help of laboratory common investigations and, more rarely, with specialised ones.

There is a need for a thorough technological support, adequate medical and nursing staff, as well as the input of experts on basic specialties and paediatric subspecialties; these conditions do not all exist. In the 1st Paediatric Department of the \u2018Penteli\u2019 Children's Hospital, we tried to deal with common and rare paediatric problems with realism and rationality, but also on the basis of current international guidelines. However, this logical and self-evident approach presents great difficulties in its implementation. It requires knowledge, experience and, above all, good \u2018medical philosophy\u2019. I believe that this is what it was appreciated by my younger colleagues, who have worked with me during these years; and even the fact that I tried to transport all the knowledge and experience I had gained all the years of my clinical practice in the hospital to them, without sparing and selfishness.",

Many parents are unable to pay for a private practice paediatrician and they attend national health care units including tertiary paediatric national hospitals, which regularly become overcrowded. Despite this is free-of-charge, this causes an enormous work-force to the paediatric experts in the tertiary centres, who become exhausted dealing with primary health care issues. Parents also choose not to vaccinate their children according to the national vaccination programme, because they are uninsured and need to pay for their vaccines. Other parents are directed to a private practice paediatrician only when there is a serious need for their children, such as an acute infectious disease, which may require hospital admission, leaving aside developmental and preventative medicine.",

Kyriakou\u2019 and the \u2018Penteli\u2019 Children's Hospital you have diagnosed and managed several children with Kawasaki disease (KD). In one case, I remember you on the ward commenting on the possibility of the viral aetiology of KD. Since then, there have been several epidemiological studies, which have supported the concept of an infectious trigger - possibly viral - in a genetically susceptible children's population. Despite these studies, KD remains a disease of unknown cause. Is KD a viral-induced disease?",

            "text": "Answer: KD usually affects the first childhood and is due to vasculitis of the middle vessels. Its significance lies in its ability to create aneurysms in the coronary vessels and thus thrombosis and infarction. Its aetiology remains unknown, but it is thought to be an unexpected immune response to some external, potentially infectious, cause in genetically defined children; its prevalence is 25 times higher in the Far East countries than in Western countries. To date, research has not yet managed to link KD to a specific infectious cause, despite ongoing efforts (retroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, coronaviruses, staphylococcal and streptococcal antigens, e.t.c.). In my opinion, viruses remain most likely the infectious cause of KD.",

Personally, I think I have tried, as much as possible, to do just my job. I regret to note that as the years go by, physicians become more obsessed with defense medicine and technology. Technological achievements have indeed provided the physician with immeasurable help and basically have changed medicine as it was known just a few decades ago. However, its unobjectionable use without a specific diagnostic goal does not necessarily lead to the solution of the clinical problems and simply afflicts the patient, burdening family's as well as healthcare system's budget. Today, as in the past, it is essential that the clinical practice should be targeted on the basis of medical history and physical examination. The most probable diagnosis, or even the most probable ones, should be investigated in detail; not any unlikely disease should be established at the beginning of the differential diagnosis. The approach of the patient's problem should be progressive, as long as it is physically possible, and then the technology will be allied rather than dynastic.",

The basic need is summarised in the phrase \u2018train the trainers\u2019. How many of us, who train our new colleagues, are eligible for this mission? There are also paediatric departments that are under-functioning and totally inadequately staffed; in these departments new colleagues are trained and in some cases this training represents all the period of their specialty training. In addition, almost all departments, small or larger, are expected to educate a number of paediatricians disproportionately to their educational abilities; without any doubt this is a further negative factor. Training in subspecialised departments of paediatrics (e.g., neonatology, paediatric neurology, developmental medicine e.t.c.) is useful and necessary. However, to be effective, there must be specific training programmes in these departments, and trainees should not be just observers.",
