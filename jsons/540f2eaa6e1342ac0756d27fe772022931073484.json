Cytokine titers and lung virus titers were significantly higher 18 -24 h after inoculation than at 48 -72 h after inoculation in all 4 litters of pigs examined. All three cytokines were positively correlated with a 3-to 4-fold increase in BAL cell numbers (P \u00f5 .036) and with a drastic neutrophil infiltration (24% -77% of BAL cells vs. 0 -1.5% in controls) (P \u00f5 .001). In addition, cytokine production coincided with the onset of general and respiratory symptoms of influenza and with the development of a necrotizing bronchopneumonia.
