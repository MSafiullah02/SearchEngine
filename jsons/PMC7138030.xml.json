The American Medical Association1 identified overuse of five medical treatments\u2014blood transfusions, along with cardiac stents, ear tubes, antibiotics, and the induction of birth in pregnant women\u2014and highlighted the danger of unnecessary transfusions. Although blood transfusions are believed to be lifesaving, this assumption has never been shown in a controlled clinical trial; blood transfusions have been described as \u201cunavoidably, unsafe, and inherently dangerous\u201d in the US Blood Shield laws.2 Thus, perceived benefits relative to the known risks of a blood transfusion are important elements in discussions with patients about informed consent, especially in management of anaemia with alternatives to blood transfusion.3\n",

In this approach, preventive strategies are emphasised to identify, assess, and manage anaemia in medical13 and surgical14 patients, including use of pharmacological interventions15 and the avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic teting to minimise iatrogenic blood loss;16 to optimise homoeostasis17 and use of point-of-care testing;18 and to establish clinical practice guidelines for blood transfusions. With recent development of quality\u2013performance indicators for patient blood management by health-care institutions and accreditation organisations,3 the accompanying Clinical Series in The Lancet is appropriate and timely, and looks at the effect of patient blood management on three areas of transfusion medicine: blood utilisation, alternatives to blood, and inventory management of the blood supply.",
