Although the aerosol properties of bioaerosols are generally considered similar to nonbioaerosols, respirator selection and maintenance are complicated by the biologic nature. Bioaerosols include bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and dust mites. In addition, biologic products such as pollen, endotoxins, proteins, and animal excreta form aerosols. Both viable and nonviable forms of bioaerosols can be health hazardous. The infectious bioaerosols produce adverse health effects because of their ability to incubate, grow, multiply, and produce toxic substances. The health effects because of inhalation of bioaerosols depend on the number of viable particles, whereas the nonbioaerosols depend mostly on the mass of particles. Bioaerosols are sometimes employed in terrorism events. Some of the naturally occurring microorganisms can survive in the environment for a prolonged time, and they can be weaponized at a low cost. Terrorists utilize the unique features of microorganisms to cause psychologic shock on society and catastrophic effects. This suggests that respirator selection, cleaning, and reuse need to be carefully considered for a better respiratory protection against bioaerosol exposures.",

Studies on respiratory protection against TB were carried out with nonpathogenic bacteria having physical characteristics similar to that of M tuberculosis. Two decades ago, conventional surgical masks were believed to be effective barriers for retaining large droplets expelled from patients as well as from health care workers through speaking, coughing, or sneezing. However, surgical masks were not adequate to remove submicrometer-size bioaerosols.23., 24. The measurement of filtration efficiencies of different respirators against Mycobacterium chelonae another surrogate bacteria of M tuberculosis, showed that DMF and a HEPA were more effective than the DM and single-use submicron surgical mask under a constant flow of 46 L/min.25 Mean percentage efficiencies for viable M chelonae ranged from 97% for the DM and the surgical mask to more than 99.99% for the HEPA respirator.25\n",

Higher flow rate (85 L/min) resulted in higher penetration, and changes in relative humidity caused minimal effects on bioaerosol collection.27 Filter performance against biologic agents was consistent with the expectations for nonbiological agents, based on their certified performance.",

This study revealed that the microbial penetration through respirators was dependent on the aspect (length to width) ratio of the bacteria.28\n",

The volume of air (flow rate times cross-sectional area) is the air that passes through the cross-sectional area of the respirator filter. Assembled filters are generally not flat.

Previous studies on respiratory measurements have reported a dramatic increase in peak inspiratory air flow rate and minute volume under heavy work conditions, suggesting the need for further investigation on filter penetration of aerosol particles at high airflow velocities.31., 32., 33., 34. Several studies investigated the filter penetration of particles at high airflow rates.35., 36. Hinds and Kraske tested the penetration of different aerodynamic diameter size aerosol particles through half-mask and single-use respirators at flow rates over the range of 2 to 150 L/min using a manikin model.35 Submicrometer aerosol particles exhibited increased penetration levels with increased flow rates, whereas particles greater than 1 \u03bcm showed no significant effect.35 This result has been subsequently confirmed in a study with a surgical mask, which showed that the penetration of 0.3-\u03bcm particles is strongly dependent on airflow.36 In another study, increasing flow rates from 16 to 85 L/min shifted the most penetrating particle size region toward a smaller particle size.36a\n",

The number of bioaerosol particles that penetrate through the filter is critical to assess the health problems, whereas nonbiologic aerosols typically depend on the total mass of particles. In the case of bioaerosols, the penetration of a certain number of pathogenic organisms through the filter at higher flow rates may be sufficient to cause serious health problems. This suggests that measuring techniques that count the number of submicron particles reliably may be more appropriate for assessing protection against biologic agents than methods assessing the mass of penetrating particles.",

They observed that less aerosols passed through a slit-like leak or multiple small circular leaks than a single circular size leak of equal cross-sectional area at a given pressure differential across the filter. Their study suggested that a face-seal leakage at low-breathing rate may cause a HEPA respirator to provide less protection than a DM respirator. This was due to a higher pressure drop for a HEPA respirator, resulting in more aerosol flow through the leak.39\n",

Qian et al. showed that N95 respirators were highly efficient in filtering airborne microbial particles when the respirator was sealed to the head form.26 However, laboratory studies on N95 respirator performance in human subjects showed that the 95th percentile of the total penetrations for each respirator (95% of wearers of the respirator can expect to have a total penetration value below the 95th percentile penetration value) without fit testing ranged from 6% to 88%, with an average of 33%.44 When fit-test screening was applied to the data, the 95th percentile of the total penetrations for each respirator decreased to 1% to 16%, with a mean value of 4%, suggesting that fit testing was necessary to achieve the high level of protection. The different aspects of qualitative and quantitative fit testing have been characterized by different research groups.41., 42., 44., 45., 46. A recent study showed the importance of respirator fit characteristics.47 Other factors including facial dimensions that influence the level of protection have been described.48., 49., 50. Further research is needed in the following areas: (1) define the facial sizes of the worker population, so manufacturers can better design respirators to fit the broad range of facial dimensions in the workplace; (2) reduce errors in fit-test measurements that result in some poorer fits passing and some better fits being rejected; and (3) reduce variations in fit factors among donnings.",

Similar conclusions were obtained by Moyer and Bergman, who exposed N95 respirators from different manufacturers to 5 mg sodium chloride aerosol, 1 day a week over a period of several weeks.54 Whether filters exposed to bioaerosols undergo similar filter-efficiency degradation is unclear. Additionally, there are no indicators to signal the user when the efficiency of the filter has been reduced by exposure to industrial aerosols, chemicals, humidity, or temperature. Future research is needed to understand better the mechanisms of efficiency degradation, its causes, and indicators of exposures that could cause a reduction in efficiency.

A negative-pressure half face-piece respirator provided very little protection, whereas a negative-pressure full face-piece respirator offered good protection against anthrax spore exposure. However, very little risk of anthrax infection was assigned to a full face-piece PAPR. This analysis suggested that full face-piece PAPR was the best air-purifying device for responding to an anthrax spore attack.",

Although respirator selection against bioaerosol should be based on the infectious dose of the microorganism, setting an exposure limit for an individual biologic agent is complicated by several factors. The infectious dose levels of various pathogenic organisms are not fully defined. Second, the airborne concentrations of different types of microorganisms at any given time are unknown. In addition, the survival and viability of the microorganisms vary with time because of the inherent properties of organisms. For example, spores may be alive for several years compared with vegetative bacteria and fungus. Finally, possible reaerosolization (bedding, and others) may cause additional uncertainty (latency periods) in all of the above. For example, anthrax spores used in the Hart Senate Office Building were found to reaerosolize under office working conditions.58\n",

A qualitative evaluation for the presence of viable organisms on 5 types of surgical masks and 18 types of respirator filters challenged with M abscessus, S epidermidis, and B subtilis was performed.62 The organisms were eluted from filters following exposure, and culturability (percentage of filters with culturable organisms) was determined. The culturability ranged from 35% to 100% for M abscessus, 50% to 100% for S epidermidis, and 88% to 100% for B subtilis at prestorage conditions. After storage for 5 days, the culturability was 1% to 60% for M abscessus, 0% to 100% for S epidermidis, and 87% to 100% for B subtilis, suggesting that respirator reuse should be carefully considered.62 They also observed that the survival (the ratio of colony forming units measured before and after storage) of M abscessus was the least and B subtilis the most. In another study, the survival of M smegmatis (a surrogate of M tuberculosis) on N95 respirators was tested after 1 to 9 days.63 Bacteria collected on respirator filters were not able to grow and were only able to survive for up to 3 days, even under ideal growth conditions.62 In a similar study, bacterial survival on NIOSH-certified polypropylene respirator filters has been reported.64 Although P fluorescens and B subtilis were unable to grow on polypropylene filters, both bacteria survived. P fluorescens on filters lost its viability in less than 3 days, and B subtilis remained viable for over 13 days.64 These studies indicate that spore-forming bacteria may have a greater viability compared with vegetative bacteria. This suggests that the reuse of respirator filters exposed to microorganisms needs careful consideration. Studies on survival of microorganisms with different membrane components at various environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity, are needed to understand the mechanism of microbial survival. Future studies on microbial survival on different parts of the respirator should be conducted to assess better and reduce potential problems associated with the reuse of respirators.",

Ninety-three percent reported replacement of inhalation and exhalation valves, and 89% indicated inspection of harness/straps, face piece, and valves. Filters and cartridges were inspected by 75% of the respondents. Eleven percent of the companies reported respirator inspection before and after use, whereas 85% reported daily inspection.

The University of Michigan nanoemulsion performed well against B globigii adsorbed on ceiling tile, panel fabric, and cement, and the SNL aqueous foam was highly efficient for painted wallboard and carpet material.

An efficient decontamination of microbial material on smooth surfaces compared with surface materials such as carpet was observed in this study.

In one study, bacterial penetration was carried out at 85 L/min, simulating breathing conditions under heavy work, and reaerosolization was measured with airflow opposite to the loading direction. The percentage of reaerosolization was insignificant with N95 respirators when tested with B subtilis and B megatherium at 22% relative humidity.77 Reaerosolization of B subtilis and B megatherium did not exceed 0.025% even at high reentrainment air velocity of 300 cm/sec, which corresponded to 37 times the loading velocity. Under these conditions, the reaerosolization of 5-\u03bcm polystyrene (PSL) particles was about 6%. Further studies showed that reaerosolization of 0.6- to 5.1-\u03bcm particles increased with the square of particle size and the reaerosolization velocity and decreased with increasing relative humidity.78 The percentage of particles reentrained from filter was not altered by the thickness of filter media, suggesting deposition of particles on the uppermost fibers of the filter. However, an increase in filter media thickness decreased the percentage of particles when the reentrainment airflow was in the same direction as that of loading.78\n",

The reaerosolization of particles was dependent on the characteristics of aerosol particles as shown by the air cleaner dust particles showing high levels of reaerosolization followed by PSL, NaCl, and corn oil particles.78 These studies indicate that reaerosolization of particles greater than 1 \u03bcm is significantly greater compared with submicrometer particles.
