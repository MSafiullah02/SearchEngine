Efficient propagation of astrovirus strains from both human and animal origin in cultured cells has permitted advances in the characterization of their life cycle (Fig. 2.1). After astrovirus cell entry, the genomic RNA is uncoated and is then translated into a polyprotein precursor that is subsequently cleaved into the proteins required for replication of the virus genome and assembly of progeny viruses. These processes most likely take place in association with cellular membranes, and completion of the virus life cycle requires the action of caspases for the virus particles to exit the cell.\n",

The viral genome contains 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) and three open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 2.2). The two ORFs located toward the 5\u2032-end of the genome, designated ORF1a and ORF1b, encode nonstructural proteins that are presumed to be involved in RNA transcription and replication based on the sequence motifs they contain. The third ORF, found at the 3\u2032-end of the genome, designated ORF2, is common to both the genomic and subgenomic RNAs and encodes the capsid proteins [50, 76]. An additional ORF (ORF-X) of 91\u2013122 codons, contained within ORF2 in a +1 reading frame, has been described in all HAstV and some other mammalian viruses (Fig. 2.2) [18]. Its initiation codon is located 41\u201350 nucleotides downstream the ORF2 AUG and might be translated through a leaky scanning mechanism. It remains to be determined whether the putative protein encoded in ORF-X is synthesized in HAstV-infected cells and its significance for virus replication.\n",

ORF1b is similar in length among all astroviruses. Comparative analysis of ORF2 among astrovirus has been more complete, because the sequences of a large number of strains of diverse origin have been determined.

            "text": "A comparison of the complete genome sequences of astrovirus strains reported thus far has recognized common features. An overlap of 10\u2013148 nt in the genome of mammalian viruses has been found between ORF1a and ORF1b. These two ORFs also overlap in avian viruses, but this overlapping is only 12\u201345 nt long [54]. The overlapping region contains signals that are essential for translation of the viral RNA polymerase encoded in ORF1b through a frameshift mechanism. During infection of susceptible cells, two positive-sense RNA species have been observed: the full-length genomic RNA (gRNA), and a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA, of \u223c2.4 kb) [38, 49]. Both RNAs are transcribed from the negative-sense full-length complement of the genomic RNA. Based on the transcription initiation site determined for the sgRNA in HAstV-1 and HAstV-2 [50, 76], ORF1b and ORF2 overlap by 8 nt; however, the length of this overlapping may vary, and it is not present in a duck astrovirus, in which it is 24 nt apart [19]. The synthesis of sgRNA requires an internal subgenomic promoter in the negative-sense RNA, and a highly conserved sequence in mammalian astroviruses around the ORF2 start codon that has been suggested to be part of the promoter for synthesis of the sgRNA [36]. This sequence is also conserved in avian astroviruses, but is slightly different in sequence and length [54]. This conserved sequence has a partial identity with the 5\u2032-end of the gRNA [36], suggesting it has an important role for the synthesis of both gRNA and sgRNA.",

Of note, in addition to the 3\u2032 UTR, the terminal 19 nt of ORF2 are also highly conserved among HAstV serotypes [48], and similarities have been observed in the sequence and folding of the 3\u2032 UTR of several animal astroviruses, as well as in avian infectious bronchitis virus (a coronavirus), a dog norovirus, and the equine rhinovirus serotype 2 [36].

The length of nsp1a varies in mammalian viruses from 787 to 950 aa long, and in avian viruses it can be as long as 1,240 aa (Table 2.1). The most evident feature of nsp1a is the presence of a protease motif. The sequence of the predicted protease is well conserved between HAstV strains, but less conserved between mammalian and avian astroviruses, with only 37% amino acid identity between HAstV-1, turkey astrovirus, and avian necrosis virus [34]. The protein displays the typical properties of trypsin-like enzymes. The crystal structure (2.0 \u00c5 resolution) of the predicted protease from a HAstV strain revealed a similarity with viral serine proteases from Sesbania mosaic virus and various picornaviruses (human rhinovirus 2, hepatitis A virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus).

Its synthesis in astrovirus-infected cells has not been investigated; however, similar to calicivirus, treatment of the viral genomic RNA with proteases markedly reduced the yield of infectious virus when the astrovirus genome was transfected into permissive cells, suggesting that the ability of the astrovirus genome to initiate a replication cycle depends on the presence of a genome-linked protein [31, 70]. A hypervariable region with deletions and insertions downstream the VPg motif has been related to adaptation of the virus to culture cells [73] and to efficient synthesis of viral RNA during infection [30]. However, the form in which this region might modulate these events is unknown. The role in viral replication of the C-terminal region of nsp1a, comprising from aa residue 568 to the C terminus of the protein has been analyzed. This region, named nsp1a/4 [29], includes the putative VPg protein and the hypervariable region, and was found to be phosphorylated and to form oligomers. Nsp1a/4 interacts with the RNA polymerase when translated in vitro, and this interaction depends on the phosphorylation status of the protein. The fact that the proposed phosphorylation site is in the putative VPg region supports the idea that nsp1a/4 could be implicated in the replication of the astrovirus genome [20]. In addition, nsp1a/4 has a perinuclear distribution near the endoplasmic reticulum and colocalizes with viral RNA [29]. Whether the region of nsp1a/4 that interacts with the replicase is equivalent to the predicted VPg protein remains to be determined.",

The N-terminal half of the polyprotein is more conserved than the C-terminal domain, with the N-terminal region encompassing a region of basic amino acids that is conserved among astrovirus [35, 72] and is thought to interact with the genomic RNA in the virion [23]. The C-terminal half of the protein shows considerable sequence variability among astroviruses isolated from different animal species, or even among different \u00adisolates from the same species (Fig. 2.4) as it contains a delimited region with abundant insertion or deletions [72]. The carboxy terminus of the polyprotein has an acidic character (residues 649\u2013702 for HAstV-8) that is proposed to be highly conserved among all members of the Astroviridae family (Fig. 2.4) [54] and is the substrate of cellular caspases. The last five amino acid residues at the C-terminal end are also conserved among human and other mammalian virus strains. The conserved N-terminal domain of the structural protein forms the capsid core of the particle, whereas the hypervariable C-terminal domain forms the spikes of the virion. Thus, this last domain is predicted to participate in the early interactions of the virus with the host cell [16, 40].\n",

The cellular receptor is unknown; however, the observation that different HAstV serotypes show different tropism in cultured cells [7] suggests that more than one cellular attachment or receptor molecule may be used by these viruses. Caco-2 cells are susceptible to infection by all HAstV serotypes, but HTC-15, another colon carcinoma cell line, only weakly supports infection by HAstV-1 [7]. Likewise, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells only permit the sustained passage of HAstV-2, but they are permissive for replication of other HAstV serotypes after transfection of in vitro transcribed genomic RNA [21], suggesting that the blockage is at the virus entry level. It has been found that HAstV-8 binds to the surface of Caco-2 cells with a half-time of about 9 min (M\u00e9ndez et al., unpublished), and it is known that the infectivity of HAstV is greatly enhanced (3\u20135 logs) by, and probably is dependent on, trypsin cleavage of the capsid protein [4, 55, 61]. Although the trypsin cleavage products have been characterized (see below), the mechanism by which this treatment enhances virus infectivity is unknown. Trypsin cleavage of the precursor polyprotein produces in HAstV-8 three final products, VP34, VP25, and VP27 [55], with the concomitant induction of drastic structural changes in the particles [4]. VP34 represents the conserved domain and forms the capsid core, while both VP25 and VP27 form the spikes on the virion surface. The crystal structure of the HAstV-8 spike domain was recently solved at a 1.8 \u00c5 resolution [16], mapping conserved residues onto the astrovirus projection domain revealed a putative receptor binding site with amino acid compositions characteristic for polysaccharide recognition [16]. Antibodies that recognize the spike proteins VP25 and VP27 are serotype specific and neutralize virus infectivity [5, 61], probably by blocking virus binding.",

This was supported by inhibition of viral infection by endocytosis-blocking drugs [15]. An acidic endosomal pH was also found to be required for HAstV-1 infection [15]. Recently, a clathrin-dependent endocytosis was confirmed to be a functional pathway for the entry of HAstV-8 into Caco-2 cells. Drugs that affect clathrin assembly, endosome acidification, and actin filaments, as well as those that decrease cellular cholesterol and interfere with vesicular transport, reduced the infectivity of HAstV-8. The infection of this virus was also reduced by knocking down the expression of clathrin heavy chain by RNA interference and by expression of dominant-negative mutants of dynamin (M\u00e9ndez et al., unpublished data).",

Although the mechanism for this activation is unknown, it was independent of virus replication, suggesting that this pathway is triggered during virus binding or entry into the cell [51]. ERK1/2 seems to be required at early times to establish a productive infection, since inhibitors of this kinase blocked synthesis of viral proteins and RNA, and, consequently, reduced the virus yield. It has also been shown that astrovirus increases barrier permeability in polarized monolayers of Caco-2 cells following apical infection [52]. Permeability was increased when monolayers were treated not only with infectious virus, but also with inactivated virus or purified virus-like particles (VLPs), indicating that astrovirus-induced permeability occurs independently of viral replication and is modulated by the capsid protein. It has been suggested that HAstV could trigger tight junction instability to reach putative receptors present in the basolateral membrane; however, the fact that the increase in permeability is observed at least 16 h postinfection suggests that more than a requirement for virus entry, it is a consequence of the cellular signal transduction pathways induced by the virus.",

This protein assembles into viral particles and is then cleaved at the carboxy terminus by cellular caspases to produce a 70-kDa protein (VP70) through several intermediate cleavage events (Fig. 2.4) [55]. The VP90 to VP70 cleavage is associated with the exit of the virus from the cell. A 90 kDa protein in HAstV-1 infected cells has also been detected [49, 70]. The intracellular cleavage of the primary translation product of ORF2 still requires further investigation; however, it seems clear that extracellular virions are only constituted by VP70 [55]. These virions require trypsin treatment to fully activate their infectivity. The proteolytic treatment cleaves VP70 into three smaller products and enhances virus infectivity up to 105-fold [4, 42]. The trypsin cleavage pathway of VP70 has been best characterized for HAstV-8 (Fig. 2.4) and yields cleavage products of 25, 27, and 34 kDa. The cleavage products are similar in other astrovirus strains studied, although their sizes range from 24 to 26, 27 to 29, and 32 to 34 kDa [4, 6, 12, 23, 55]. Of interest, if intracellular viral particles formed by VP90 are isolated and treated with trypsin in vitro they also become infectious [53].",

In vitro transcribed RNA from a full-length cDNA clone of the HAstV-1 genome has also proved to be infectious [21]. Using this clone, a reverse genetics system for HAstV-1 was established and used to analyze specific mutations in the structural [23] and nonstructural proteins [30]. This system consists of the in vitro transcribed RNA, which is transfected into the highly transfectable, but nonsusceptible and poorly permissive BHK-21 cells, harvesting the virus produced, and propagating this virus in the astrovirus-susceptible Caco-2 cell line. This protocol, although efficient in terms of virus yield after amplification in Caco-2 cells, has the drawback that the mutant virus is finally obtained after several rounds of replication in the latter cells, which might induce accumulation of additional mutations in the viral progeny. Thus, analysis of the phenotype associated with specific mutations introduced in the cDNA clone may be disguised. In fact, viruses with changes not related to the mutations originally introduced in the nonstructural region of HAstV-1 were found after virus recovery by this method [30]. More recently, a protocol that improves the reverse genetics system of astrovirus has been described [70]. It uses the highly transfectable and HAstV-susceptible and highly permissive hepatocyte cell line Huh7.5.1 making it possible to obtain higher titer virus yield in a single replication cycle, decreasing the frequency of potentially undesired mutations [70].",

Similar structures were found in HAstV-8-infected Caco-2 cells, where large groups of viral particles surrounding \u201cO-ring\u201d structures that probably correspond to double-membrane vesicles were described (Fig. 2.5b, c) [53]. Virus-like particles were observed inside and at the borders of the \u201cO-ring\u201d and could represent subviral particles at different assembling stages [53]. Moreover, the VP90 structural precursor protein was detected in membrane fractions resolved by density gradient centrifugation and analyzed by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 2.5d, e) [53]. Of interest, ultrastructural analysis of the jejunum and ileum of astrovirus-infected lambs showed viral particles aggregates within lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles of epithelial cells, as well as along microvilli (Fig. 2.5f) [27], suggesting that astrovirus replication associated with membranes also occurs in naturally targeted intestinal epithelial cells.\n",

The presence of structural (VP90) and nonstructural (nsp1a/4, protease, RdRp) viral proteins, as well as viral RNAs, in membranous fractions suggests that RNA replication and the first steps of virus morphogenesis are carried out in association with the observed membranous structures. It is still unknown, however, if RNA replication and virus assembly occur at the same subcellular membranous structure. The putative replicase complex of astrovirus seems to associate with membranes that probably derive from the ER, since viral phosphoproteins of 21\u201327 kDa, which interact with the RdRp [20], and are likely involved in RNA replication, localize to this organelle [29].",

VLPs were assembled in this system when a truncated form of the structural polyprotein lacking the N-terminal 70 amino acids was expressed, or when a protein whose 70 N-terminal amino acids had been replaced by the green fluorescent protein was synthesized [9], indicating that the 70 N-terminal amino acids of the structural polyprotein are not essential for virus particle assembly; although it is believed that this region, of basic nature, is important for interaction with the viral genome during morphogenesis of the viral particle [54]. When the VLPs assembled in insect cells were further characterized by ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, the particles banded at a density of 1.08 g/ml, and electron microscopy analysis showed the presence in this fraction of VLPs around 38 nm in diameter, similar to HAstV-1 purified particles, as well as ring-like structures of 16 nm in diameter [9]. Of interest, these ring-like structures could be converted into VLPs in the presence of Mg2+, while sequestration of divalent cations promoted the disassembly of VLPs into ring-like structures [9]. These observations showed the importance of divalent ions to maintain the capsid structure and suggest that the ring-like structures could be directly involved in VLP morphogenesis. The ring-like structures were also observed when native HAstV-1 viruses were purified by CsCl centrifugation in the presence of EDTA.",

In this context, it is interesting that VP90 has been observed to form oligomers (dimers and trimers) in virus-infected Caco-2 cells, suggesting that this protein can assemble into intermediary structures during virion assembly [53]. Moreover, the N-terminal region of VP90 has a basic character that is conserved among astrovirus and is believed to interact with gRNA during packaging and assembly [54]; however, there is no information yet about encapsidation signals in the astrovirus gRNA.",

Analysis of HAstV-8-infected cells by density ultracentrifugation showed that intracellular viral particles consisting of VP90 were present in association with membranes as well as in \u00admembrane-free fractions [53]. Based on these and related findings [3], a model was proposed in which the viral progeny assemble in membranous structures, and then dissociate from the membranes by an unknown mechanism; once in a membrane-free environment the assembled VP90 is then proteolytically cleaved at the C-terminal end to yield viral particles containing VP70 (Fig. 2.6). This cleavage is blocked by caspase inhibitors and induced by TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis ligand), suggesting an active role of caspases in the process [57], although it is not clear if VP90 processing occurs intracellularly or concomitantly with cell egress of the virus. The involvement of caspases in this process is supported by the presence of an acidic region in the C-terminal region of VP90, conserved in astroviruses, that contains several putative caspases recognition motifs [57].\n",

Furthermore, executioner caspases-3/7, as well as initiator caspases-4, -8, and -9, were all activated at 12 h postinfection [3] as determined by the cleavage of preferential substrates of these caspases [3]. In addition, the precursor forms of all evaluated caspases were processed in these cells, confirming their active status, and suggesting that more than one caspase is active during astrovirus infection [3]. In contrast with these results, neither the apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial pathway nor caspase-9 was activated in HAstV-4-infected Caco-2 cells, although the processed product of pro-caspase-8 was detected, suggesting its activation [28].",

In vitro translation of truncated forms of HAstV-8 VP90 suggests that the caspase motif TYVD657, in the C-terminal acid region of VP90, is the most likely to be cleaved to yield VP70, although cleavages at motifs DEVD666 and EETD672 could generate the 75 to 82 kDa processing intermediate products of VP90 that have been observed in infected cells (Fig. 2.4) [3, 54]. In agreement with this observation, the recently reported crystallographic structure of the HAstV-8 capsid spike suggested that the aspartic acid residue at position 657 should be accessible to caspases in intact particles [16].",

            "text": "Although the cellular process triggered by caspase cleavage of VP90 to allow virus exit is unknown, it seems that cell death is neither induced by, nor required for this process, and rather a nonlytic mechanism seems to be involved [3]. Caspase activation does not always result in cell death or secondary necrosis and the activation level of these proteases and their interaction with cellular proteins modulate cell death progression [41]. The requirement of VP90 processing by caspases for virus exit has been confirmed through the use of caspase inhibitors. A potent inhibitor for executioner caspases-3/7, Ac-DEVD-CHO, blocked virus release at levels similar to those induced by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. On the other hand, inhibitors of initiator caspases-8 and -9 had no effect on virus egress [3]. Thus, although VP90 can be cleaved in astrovirus-infected cells by caspases-3 and -9, as described earlier, virus exit seems to depend on the activity of caspases 3/7 but not of caspase-9, and most probably on the activity of caspase-3, since RNA interference of the expression of this caspase has a strong negative effect on virus release [3].",

The release of nonenveloped viruses, such as astrovirus, is generally believed to occur by cell membrane destabilization. However, rotavirus and poliovirus exit the cells through a nonlytic mechanism, and in the later case, probably through autophagic vesicles [32]. Thus, intracellular transport of astrovirus particles could be important for cell exit. It has not been determined whether autophagy is induced during astrovirus infection, although double membrane vesicles have been observed in astrovirus-infected cells [26, 29]. Some astrovirus strains have been shown to cause cytopathic effect on cultured cells and necrosis of hepatic cells in natural infections [26]. It is unclear which astrovirus-cell interaction leads to virus egress via a lytic or nonlytic process.",

The continued application of high-resolution structural cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography of the virus and viral proteins will allow us to gain insight into the different stages of the life cycle of these viruses. Identification of the cell receptors and the entry pathway used by astroviruses to infect susceptible cells in culture, but most importantly to infect the target cells in a natural infection, will be of utmost importance to understand the biology of these viruses and to control infection. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the translation and replication of the viral genome; identification of viral and cellular proteins that participate in these processes will be fundamental to elucidate the mechanisms involved. The cell response to astrovirus infection has proved already to be beneficial for the early interactions of the virus with the cell, as well as for the last step of virus morphogenesis; however, genomic and proteomic approaches will be required to significantly advance our understanding of the virus\u2013host cell interactions that lead to productive and efficient infection. The recently improved reverse genetics system developed for astroviruses will also be key to identify the molecular determinants involved in the virus replication cycle.",
