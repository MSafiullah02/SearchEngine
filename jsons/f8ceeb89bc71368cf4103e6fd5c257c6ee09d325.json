However, little is understood about the impact of nondependent parental substance misuse upon children. Methods: We searched the international literature using rigorous systematic methods to identify studies examining parental substance misuse and adverse outcomes in children. The inclusion criteria were cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control, and cohort studies; of children aged 0-18 years whose parents are high-risk substance misusers; reporting on their health, psychological, substance use, educational, and social outcomes. Results: We identified 36 papers (from 33 unique studies)",

Due to the potential negative impact on the child, parental substance dependence is often identified as a risk factor in child welfare and child protection assessments. In England, 18% of all children in need assessments identify parental drug misuse and 19% identify parental alcohol misuse (Department for Education, 2016) . In the United States, parental substance misuse has been associated with up to two thirds of all child maltreatment cases (Traube, 2012) .",

Research estimates that between 5% and 30% of children in European countries live with at least one parent who misuses substances (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [EMCDDA] , 2010), 10.5% of children in the United States, and 13% of children in Australia (Dawe et al., 2007) . In the United Kingdom, 30% of children aged under 16 years live with at least one parent who misuses alcohol and 8% with a parent who misuses illicit drugs (Manning, Best, Faulkner, & Titherington, 2009) . Moreover, 14% of UK infants (aged under 1 year) are exposed to parental problem, drinking, or illicit drug misuse (Manning, 2011) , while U.S. research estimates 13% of mothers are misusing alcohol 1 year after delivery (Liu, Mumford, & Petras, 2015) .",

The furthering of knowledge in this area is fundamental to enable effective and early responses to address the needs of the families affected. This rapid evidence assessment reviews published evidence reporting on adverse health, psychological, substance use, educational, and social outcomes of children of nondependent substance-misusing parents.

Children whose mother's medical record showed a history of alcohol misuse were found to have a 2-fold higher odds of long bone fracture (odds ratio [ Medium more frequently and for longer than children whose mothers did not misuse substances. Inpatient care episodes per 1,000 children were almost double in the group of children with substance misusing mothers to that of the comparison group (2,117 vs. and 1,184) with a mean duration of 3.3 days and 2.4 days, respectively (Raitasalo, Holmila, Autti-Ramo, Notkola, & Tapanainen, 2015) .

Only one study examined the impact of parental misuse of substances other than alcohol (Torvik et al., 2011) , finding an association of modest effect size upon child attention and conduct problems. Studies mostly reported association between both mothers' and fathers' substance misuse and child externalizing difficulties. One paper reported that the relationship was greater when maternal alcohol misuse was present (Torvik et al., 2011) . A further study found gender-modeling associations between the parent and child; maternal alcohol misuse was found to be significantly correlated with rule-breaking and aggressive behavior in girls but not in boys, while paternal alcohol misuse was found to be significantly associated with aggressive behavior in boys but not girls (Finan, Schulz, Gordon, & Ohannessian, 2015) . There was limited evidence of a significant association between maternal or paternal alcohol misuse and internalizing disorders in children. In a medium quality study using child report measures of parental drinking, both paternal and maternal alcohol misuse were related to depression and anxiety for girls but not for boys (Ohannessian, 2012) . In a small, medium-quality cohort study of Korean school children aged 12-16 years, parental alcohol misuse was found to be ",

            "text": "There is a large volume of evidence that parental substance misuse influenced their child's own substance use, with all 23 included papers (reporting on 20 unique studies) finding a significant association. This evidence is mostly of medium to high quality with only two studies being of low quality (Jeffreys et al., 2009; Yule, Wilens, Martelon, MSimon, & Biederman, 2013) . Parental alcohol and/or drug misuse was significantly associated with early onset adolescent drinking (Kerr, Capaldi, Pears, & Owen, 2012; Vermeulen-Smit et al., 2012) , alcohol consumption (Cranford, Zucker, Jester, Puttler, & Fitzgerald, 2010; Haugland, Holmen, Ravndal, & Bratberg, 2013; Jennison, 2014; Keeley, Mongwa, & Corcoran, 2015; Shorey et al., 2013; Vermeulen-Smit et al., 2012) , alcohol intoxication (Haugland, Holmen, Krokstad, Sund, & Bratberg, 2015; Haugland et al., 2013; Haugland, Strandheim, & Bratberg, 2012; Keeley et al., 2015; Rossow et al., 1999) , and the development of alcohol problems (Kendler et al., 2013; Lieb et al., 2002) as well as adolescent illicit drug use (Delaney-Black et al., 2011; Haugland et al., 2012; Hofler et al., 1999; Hopfer, Stallings, Hewitt, & Crowley, 2003; Jeffreys et al., 2009; Keeley et al., 2015; Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2010; Shorey et al., 2013) . Having two parents who misuse substances was highlighted as being particularly predictive of adolescent substance use (Keeley et al., 2015; Swaim, Beauvais, Walker, & Silk-Walker, 2011) , with regular alcohol use being almost 4 times as likely (OR \u00bc 3.83, CI [1.65, 8 .89], p < .01) and past year illicit drug use almost 6 times as likely (OR \u00bc 5.90, CI [2.54, 13 .7], p < .001) as adolescents with two nonsubstance misusing parents (Keeley et al., 2015) . There were mixed findings as to whether the mothers' or fathers' substance misuse had the strongest association with child alcohol and/or drug use. Six studies found that both maternal and paternal substance misuse correlated with adolescents' alcohol (Finan et al., 2015; Haugland et al., 2013; Keeley et al., 2015; van der Zwaluw et al., 2008) and drug use (Finan et al., 2015; Keeley et al., 2015) to a similar size of effect. Studies found that only fathers' and not mothers' substance misuse was positively associated with adolescent drinking (Cranford et al., 2010; Ohannessian, 2012) and the range of substances used in adolescent children (Shorey et al., 2013) . Further studies, however, reported only maternal alcohol misuse (Kerr et al., 2012) and maternal drug misuse (Yule et al., 2013) to be significantly associated with development of alcohol or drug misuse in children. When also considering child gender, both boys and girls have been found to be significantly more likely to engage with substance using behaviors if their parents misused alcohol, with boys in particular being found to experience a negative effect (Haugland et al., 2012) .",

Using a large cohort of over 740,000 Swedish individuals, Berg, Back, Vinnerljung, and Hjern (2016) conducted a high-quality study finding that alcohol-related hospital admissions in parents were significantly associated with lower school performance in adolescents aged 15-16 years (Berg, Back, Vinnerljung, & Hjern, 2016) . School behavioral problems were associated with paternal alcohol misuse in early childhood, with a 3-fold risk of truancy, absenteeism, suspensions, and conduct problems in a medium quality study (Jennison, 2014) . Family dysfunction, conflict, and ineffectual parenting were found to be strongly correlated to adverse school outcomes for children in families with an alcohol misusing father. The low levels of attachment and bonding to biological fathers found to be associated with an increase in school-related behavioral problems of the children were notable. A small low-quality study in Australia also found children of substance misusers were more often absent or late for school (Jeffreys et al., 2009) .",

Four studies of medium quality considered the association between alcohol misusing parents and the parent-child relationship. While one study showed no significant impact upon the support provided to the child from the parent (van der Zwaluw et al., 2008) , a further study reported that children of alcohol misusing parents were significantly less likely to feel emotionally close to their father, either due to the impact of alcohol misuse upon the father's behavior, conflict within the home, abdication of family responsibilities, or estrangement (Jennison, 2014) . Parental bonding and the parent-child relationship were negatively related to both mothers' and fathers' alcohol misuse in other research (Shorey et al., 2013) . There is conflicting evidence that parental monitoring is negatively associated with parental alcohol misuse. One study reported a significant association between parental alcohol misuse and lower levels of parental monitoring (Shorey et al., 2013) , while a further study reported that parental alcohol misuse was unrelated to a number of measures of neglectful parenting practices (Freisthler, Johnson-Motoyama, & Kepple, 2014) .",

Children of alcohol misusing mothers were 5 times more likely to be placed in care by their seventh birthday than those raised by nonalcohol misusing parents. Those born to drug misusing mothers were over 7 times more likely to be in care by the age of 7, while children whose mothers misused both alcohol and drugs faced a 9-fold increased risk. These relationships persisted after controlling for the child's gender and mothers' socioeconomic status. Once in care, children of substance misusing mothers were discharged 183% faster than those children whose mothers did not misuse substances (Hussey & Guo, 2005) . This somewhat counterintuitive finding is most likely to relate to an accelerated decision to place the children in permanent care however rather than reunification of the family. Further, the low quality of this study means that findings should be interpreted with caution. A cohort study of children taken into care also reported on the range of abuse children may experience while living within substance misusing homes (Jeffreys et al., 2009) . Due to the small sample size in this study, no statistical testing could be conducted. As such, the existence of a correlation between parental substance use and abuse is unknown.",

This evidence is more pronounced when both parents misuse alcohol and/or drugs or when one or more parents misuse a combination of alcohol and drugs. In early childhood (0-7 years), the evidence from high-quality studies suggests an increased likelihood of experiencing an injury or health concern, resulting in the need for medical care. The methodological quality of studies examining an association with diet, child weight, and dental health is however of low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Maternal alcohol misuse in particular is highlighted as a key predictor for poorer child health. This may in part relate to the greater role mothers tend to play in the child's early years. However, there was a paucity of research considering substances other than alcohol and relating to fathers' substance misuse that may result in a misleading focus on mothers.",

Social learning theory explains that we learn behavior from observing, imitating, and modeling those around us (Bandura, 1997) . It is possible that when children observe their parents consuming alcohol and/or drugs, it encourages the development of normative views about substance use. Further, the availability of alcohol or other substances within the home may increase the likelihood of adolescent use (Peeters, Koning, Monshouwer, Vollebergh, & Wiers, 2016) .",

The involvement of child welfare services as well as out-ofhome placements for children was also higher in children whose parents misuse substances. The evidence for an association with other social and relational difficulties is however mixed. There was some suggestion that parental alcohol use was associated with lower levels of parent-child bonding, communication, and overall relationship quality. However, evidence of neglectful parenting or inadequate parental supervision was limited and at times contradictory and as such caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding an association between parental substance misuse and the quality of parental supervision. Methodological issues further limit the evidence.",

While social workers within children's welfare services consider it legitimate within their role to ask parents about their drug and alcohol use, they experience difficulty in identifying parents who are substance misusers (Galvani, Hutchinson, & Dance, 2013; Loughran, Honhman, & Finnegan, 2010) . Typically, they rely upon observations of the parent's physical presentation and behavior, which is unlikely to detect levels of misuse below the diagnostic criteria for dependence (Galvani et al., 2013) . Furthermore, those parents who are identified as being substance misusers often do not receive an intervention, with parents expressing reluctance to engage with specialist drug and alcohol treatment providers as they did not perceive themselves as having a substance misuse problem (Forrester & Harwin, 2006) . This suggests that early, opportunistic intervention delivered by a nontreatment specialist may be more appropriate.",

However, there are no studies examining the effectiveness of screening and brief interventions with substance misusing parents including those whose children are involved with child welfare services. This represents a missed opportunity to intervene with this population before a parent has developed substance dependency. Such intervention has the potential to prevent the development of more problematic patterns of use and prevent harm to children. Social workers should engage in conversations with parents, which promote the parent's ability to link their substance misuse with adverse experiences and risk of negative outcomes for their child. Such an interaction may replicate the \"teachable moment\" found to be conducive of behavior change following the delivery of brief interventions within other settings (Babor & Grant, 1992) and improving outcomes for children.",

In early adolescence (10-13 years), there is a lack of research into child education outcomes, and in each stage of adolescence (10-18 years), there is a lack of research into parental substance misuse and child health.

Such naive comparisons of exposed and unexposed groups cannot adequately account for the many potential confounders nor precisely account for the measurement of effect (Fewell, Davey Smith, & Sterne, 2007) . For example, genetic predisposition (Agrawal & Lynskey, 2008) and the interaction between genes and the environment (Cleveland & Wiebe, 2003) may result in intergeneration transmission of substance misuse. Alcohol permissive parenting (Ennett et al., 2016; Hung, Chang, Luh, Wu, & Yen, 2015) , adolescent monitoring (Kerr, Stattin, & Burk, 2010 ), lower parent-child relationship quality (Donaldson, Handren, & Crano, 2016; El-Sheikh & Buckhalt, 2003; Shorey et al., 2013) , and greater family conflict (El-Sheikh & Flanagan, 2001; Kelly et al., 2011) have been associated with increased child substance misuse. Furthermore, the direction of a reported relationship cannot be determined. For example, while children's conduct difficulties could be a result of parental alcohol misuse, a parent whose child has conduct difficulties may struggle to cope with their child's behavior and their alcohol consumption may increase in response. While longitudinal studies can highlight the temporal associations between variables and may offer greater insight into causation, such inferences are reliant upon the timing of the behavior in relation to the outcome. For example, studies examining the impact of parental substance misuse upon internalizing difficulties in children may assess children prior to the emergence of any symptoms or early childhood exposure to parental substance misuse may be undetected due to behavior change that predates study inclusion (Katikireddi, Green, Taylor, Smith, & Munafo, 2017) .",

Put another way, the presence of one nonsubstance misusing parent offers some protection. Using the language of protection, rather than risk, affords an opportunity to view such protective factors as a possible intervention mechanism to enhance resilience. Given the evidence identified that factors such as maternal closeness, attachment, and parent-child relationship quality are moderators of adversity (Shorey et al., 2013) , future research should include a range of mediators and, importantly, moderators of harm, which may inform intervention development.",

While practitioners may find it challenging to identify parents whose use is not within the dependent range (Galvani et al., 2013) , intervening early in parental risk factors including alcohol and drug misuse to safeguard children has been highlighted in guidance for health, social care, and third sector partners (Department of Health, 2013; HM Government, 2015; Munro, 2011) . As the number of children living with a nondependent substance misusing parent is likely to be greater than those living with a substance-dependent parent, intervening with nondependent parents is likely to bring about most benefit to children on a population level. Working to promote resilience and to enhance the child's protective factors is also important. Parents who do not misuse substances are a resource to this end. Moreover, intervening before a parent has developed a dependency has the potential to prevent the development of more problematic patterns of use and prevent harm to children.",
