            "text": "Inflammation is carefully tuned to maximize clearance of pathogens while limiting host tissue damage (Fullerton and Gilroy 2016; Barnig et al. 2018). While pro-inflammatory signaling is essential for host protection, timely resolution is required to prevent excessive or chronic inflammatory tissue damage. Among the regulators of inflammation are members of the siglec family, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, most of which are expressed on overlapping sets of immune cells and many of which carry intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains that aid in resolution of immune responses (Macauley et al. 2014). The focus of the current study, Siglec-8, is unique in its selective expression on human eosinophils, mast cells and basophils, all of which are implicated in allergic inflammation (Bochner 2016; Schleimer et al. 2016). Siglec-8 is a transmembrane protein with its outermost N-terminal Ig-like domain mediating sialic acid glycan binding and its intracellular domain carrying ITIM and ITIM-like domains. Experimental antibody-induced cross-linking of Siglec-8 on the surface of eosinophils results in transmembrane signaling that induces eosinophil apoptosis (Kano et al. 2013), whereas cross-linking Siglec-8 on mast cells inhibits release of immune mediators (Yokoi et al. 2008). Notably, the effects of cross-linking Siglec-8 are greater when inflammatory cells are in the active rather than quiescent state (Nutku-Bilir et al. 2008), suggesting that Siglec-8-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cells is a natural step in resolving ongoing allergic inflammation to limit tissue damage. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of human Siglec-8 gene polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to asthma (Gao et al. 2010). A current hypothesis consistent with the data is that Siglec-8 on allergic inflammatory cells engages polyvalent complementary binding sialoglycans on target tissues as an integral step in resolving and appropriately limiting allergic inflammation. The identity and regulation of the Siglec-8-binding sialoglycans on inflammatory target tissues is the focus of ongoing investigations.",

Using lectin overlay histochemistry of postmortem lower human airways, we found that Siglec-8 ligands are strongly expressed in tracheal and bronchial submucosal glands and cartilage. Mouse airways failed to bind Siglec-8-Fc, consistent with the absence of both Siglec-8 and Siglec-8 ligands in mouse airways. Furthermore, we found Siglec-8 ligands were extracted from human airway tissues using guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) (but not nonionic detergents), were resolved by composite agarose\u2013acrylamide electrophoresis primarily as very large-molecular weight species and were O-linked glycans but did not co-migrate with any single major airway mucin (Yu et al. 2017). In the current study, we purified Siglec-8 ligands from human tracheal extracts by sequential size-exclusion chromatography and affinity chromatography, identified them by proteomic mass spectrometry, validated the candidate molecules and revealed that sialylated KS proteoglycan(s) are the primary carrier of Siglec-8 ligands in human airways.",

The three N-terminal extracellular Ig-like domains of human Siglec-8 were fused to a short spacer, two Ig domains from CD4, a spontaneously pentamerizing domain from cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and a 6-His C-terminal tag (Siglec-8-COMP, Figure 1A and B). On denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the expressed soluble protein product had a molecular weight of ~80 kDa as expected (Figure 1C, insert). Upon nondenaturing size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 1C), only multimeric species were detected, including an expected >400 kDa species and higher order aggregates that may be due to residual nickel cross-linking of the clustered His tag (Valenti et al. 2006).",

When that extract was subjected to denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), most of the Siglec-8 binding species were very large, hardly entering the gels. Electrophoresis in composite agarose\u2013acrylamide gels designed for separation of mucins (Holden et al. 1971) revealed a heterogeneous mixture of proteins all in the high-molecular weight range (>200 kDa to ~1 MDa). Based on those findings, Siglec-8 ligands extracted from human trachea were further resolved by size-exclusion chromatography using Sephacryl S-500 for large size range molecules. The results (Figure 2) reveal a significant resolution of Siglec-8-binding components that eluted differently than the major protein peaks near the excluded or included volumes. Upon composite gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography fractions were resolved into three major size classes that, based on relative electrophoretic mobility, were designated based on their apparent molecular weights as S8-1M (~1 MDa), S8-600K (~600 kDa) and S8-250K (~250 kDa). Fractions highly enriched in S8-1M and S8-250K were obtained, with S8-600K fractions incompletely resolved from the other two size classes. When similar extracts from several different human tissue donors were subjected to the same size-exclusion chromatography and electrophoresis, the same three size classes were found with variable ratios among them (data not shown).",

In every case only a fraction of the Siglec-8-binding material was retained. After thorough washing, the majority of the bound Siglec-8 ligands were concentrated in the eluted fractions. Elution was accomplished by the release of Siglec-8-COMP using imidazole to compete with nickel binding, releasing Siglec-8 ligand and Siglec-8-COMP (data not shown). Subsequent studies revealed that each Siglec-8 ligand was efficiently eluted from the same column by increasing the salt concentration, leaving the Siglec-8-COMP bound to the nickel column. This not only improved downstream analyses of the purified ligands (by avoiding co-elution with Siglec-8-COMP) but also allowed repeated sequential affinity column loading of the unbound material (at least three times) until most of the size-separated ligand was affinity captured and eluted.",

Furthermore, a portion of galactose residues in KS may carry a 6-sulfate. Together, this can generate the terminal sialylated sulfated disaccharide (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal) common to the synthetic glycans discovered as Siglec-8 ligands by multiple glycan array studies (Bochner et al. 2005; Campanero-Rhodes et al. 2006; Kiwamoto et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2017), and in Figure 1D. To test whether affinity binding to Siglec-8-COMP immobilized on beads was via this glycan binding site, different glycans were tested for their ability to elute one of the ligands (S8-1M) once bound to the beads (Figure 4E). Incubating with buffer alone failed to elute any of the ligand. Likewise, incubation with \u03b2-azidoethylglycosides of N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) or 3\u2032sialyl-LacNAc failed to elute ligand. In contrast, incubation with 6\u2032sulfo-3\u2032-sialyl-LacNAc released the majority of ligand from Siglec-8-COMP beads, and a small amount was released with 6-sulfo-3\u2032-sialyl-LacNAc.

Treatment with the same enzymes left the protein carrier, aggrecan, intact as evidenced by binding of anti-aggrecan antibody (G1/G2 specific).

Consistent with prior findings (Yu et al. 2017), treatment with PNGase F to remove N-linked glycans had little effect, whereas mild base treatment (\u03b2-elimination) resulted in disappearance of Siglec-8 binding consistent with the conclusion that Siglec-8-binding KS chains are O-linked (Supplementary data, Figure 1).",

            "text": "Based on the requirement of sialic acid \u03b12-3 linked to a 6-sulfated galactose for binding (Propster et al. 2016), and the requirement for GlcNAc-6-sulfation for KS chain elongation (Funderburgh 2002), we propose that Siglec-8-binding determinants on aggrecan are KS chains with the terminal disulfated trisaccharide structure Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[6 S]GlcNAc. This is a minor but well-established structural KS terminus in vertebrates including KS from abundant sources such as human and bovine cornea and articular cartilage (Brown et al. 1994, 1998; Lauder et al. 1995, 1997; Funderburgh 2000). To test the distribution of Siglec-8-binding determinants on other sources of aggrecan, the purified human Siglec-8 ligand S8-1M was compared with commercially obtained bovine articular cartilage. For comparable amounts of anti-aggrecan immunoreactivity human S8-1M robustly bound Siglec-8-Fc, whereas binding to bovine aggrecan was essentially absent (Figure 7, lane 1). To test the potential of CS chains on aggrecan to support or block Siglec-8 binding, S8-1M and bovine aggrecan were treated with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) prior to electrophoretic resolution and blotting. ChABC treatment shifted the migration position of S8-1M and increased Siglec-8 binding (Figure 7, lane 2). In contrast, ChABC had little effect on commercial bovine aggrecan but revealed a very minor Siglec-8-binding component that did not co-migrate with anti-aggrecan binding. Siglec-8 binding was eliminated by treatment with keratanase, either alone or after treatment of ChABC. Consistent with these findings, pretreatment of tissue sections of human trachea with ChABC resulted in equal (cartilage) or increased (submucosal glands) binding of Siglec-8-Fc (Figure 8). After ChABC treatment, subsequent treatment with keratanase completely eliminated Siglec-8 binding.",

After reloading the flow-through four times, most of the S8-250K in the sample had been affinity purified. Eluted fractions from the affinity chromatography runs were pooled, a portion of the combined fractions was subjected to mass spectrometric proteomics (Figure 4) and another portion was used to test biological activity. Matched experimental and control samples were prepared by treating equal portions of purified S8-250K on ice with or without addition of 6 mM sodium periodate for 30 min, then both samples with excess glycerol (300 mM) followed by 10 mM sodium borohydride on ice for 30 min. Cold mild periodate treatment results in selective oxidation of sialic acid glycerol (C7-C9) side chains and completely abrogates Siglec-8 binding (Figure 10A).",

            "text": "Most of the members of the siglec family of sialic acid-binding proteins (13 of 14 in humans) are expressed on subsets of immune cells and are believed to be immune regulatory, either inhibiting or activating depending on the particular siglec and cellular context (Macauley et al. 2014; Varki et al. 2017). Many siglecs carry ITIM and/or ITIM-like domain(s) on their intracellular C-terminus, implicating a role in inhibitory immune regulation. This implication is supported by experiments using human immune cells and animal models (Nutku et al. 2003; von Gunten et al. 2005; Yokoi et al. 2008; Cho et al. 2010; McMillan et al. 2013), indicating that engagement of certain siglecs results in immune cell apoptosis or other events associated with immune inhibition (e.g., blocking of immune mediator release). Presumably, immune cells that carry siglecs on their surface come into contact with optimal sialoglycan ligands on immune target tissues resulting in transmembrane signals that initiate immune inhibition (Schleimer et al. 2016). This scenario is particularly well established in the case of Siglec-8 on the surface of eosinophils and mast cells, where experimental treatment with anti-Siglec-8 antibodies or synthetic multivalent 6\u2032-sulfated sialoglycan polymers results in \u03b22-integrin and reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis of activated eosinophils and/or inhibition of immune mediator release by activated mast cells (Nutku-Bilir et al. 2008; Yokoi et al. 2008; Hudson et al. 2009; Carroll et al. 2017). This inhibition is believed to be a component of the natural resolution of the immune response, and these findings are a potential basis for anti-inflammatory therapy (Bochner 2016; Kiwamoto et al. 2012).",

On the 610-glycan array of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG, http://www.functionalglycomics.org) and the 125-sialoglycan array tested here (Figure 1D), Siglec-8 bound only to 6\u2032-sulfo sialyl LacNAc (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) and 6\u2032-sulfo sialyl Lewis X (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[Fuc\u03b11-3]GlcNAc).

The sialic acid-binding site, with the sialic acid carboxylate making a salt bridge to R109, is flanked by a secondary binding site (R56, Q59) that makes salt bridge and/or hydrogen bonds to the 6-sulfate on the galactose. Together, these clamp the terminal structure (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal) in place. We propose that since GlcNAc residues in KS disaccharides are uniformly 6-sulfated (Lauder et al. 1995; Brown et al. 1998; Seko et al. 2003), that the sialylated disulfated trisaccharide (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[6 S]GlcNAc) on KS is a key binding component for Siglec-8. Comparisons of Siglec-8 binding to the 6\u2032-sulfated and 6,6\u2032-disulfated forms of sialyl Lewis X (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[Fuc\u03b11-3]GlcNAc; Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[Fuc\u03b11-3][6 S]GlcNAc) by array binding (Campanero-Rhodes et al. 2006) and NMR titration (Propster et al. 2016) revealed only a modest effect of the additional sulfate on the GlcNAc residue. Isolation of intact KS chains from human airways and comparison of Siglec-8-binding and nonbinding species may reveal further subtlety or complexity in endogenous Siglec-8-binding determinants.",

Nonetheless, the discovery of aggrecan, a KS (and CS) proteoglycan as the major detected protein carrier of Siglec ligands remains surprising, even though aggrecan genetic polymorphism has been associated with asthma (Vaillancourt et al. 2012). Although aggrecan is abundant in cartilage, its presence in submucosal glands is not well established, and exposure of eosinophils and mast cells to endogenous Siglec-8 ligands likely occurs on the airway surface rather than within the cartilage layer. The hypothesis that an unusual isoform of human aggrecan binds Siglec-8 is supported by the near absence of binding to purified bovine articular cartilage aggrecan (Figure 7). Furthermore, during enrichment of Siglec-8-binding ligands by affinity chromatography, aggrecan was not similarly enriched as detected by anti-aggrecan binding (data not shown). We conclude that there is a subpopulation of aggrecan glycoforms capable of binding Siglec-8, whereas other glycoforms from human airway and bovine articular cartilage fail to bind Siglec-8. In accordance with terminology we proposed to distinguish lectin-binding glycoforms of common proteins (Taylor et al. 2017), the aggrecan glycoforms that bind Siglec-8 may be designated aggrecanS8L to distinguish them from aggrecan glycoforms that fail to bind Siglec-8.",

Although the smaller proteoglycans may include proteolytic fragments, the high-confidence C-terminal peptides identified on S8-250K (Figure 4, Table 1) suggest that may not be the case. Interestingly, whereas S8-1M migration on composite gel electrophoresis increased after ChABC treatment (without losing Siglec-8 binding, Figure 7), the migration of S8-250K was unchanged (data not shown). It is possible that migration on composite gel electrophoresis reflects differentially spliced, differentially glycosylated and/or proteolytically cleaved forms, as has been proposed for brain aggrecan isoforms (Virgintino et al. 2009). A major remaining question is whether aggrecanS8L in any form is expressed in submucosal glands and on the airway, or whether some other sialylated KS proteoglycan is produced in the submucosal glands. In either case, we conclude that unusual subclasses of sialylated KS proteoglycans are major Siglec-8-binding components on human airways and may function in the control of eosinophilic and mast cell-mediated inflammation.",
