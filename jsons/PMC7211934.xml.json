The deluge of fatal COVID-19 cases in Italy was unexpected, given the affected region\u2019s health and wealth. Italy is one of the oldest populations, with 23.3% of its population over 65 y, compared to 12% in China (4). Italy is also characterized by extensive intergenerational contacts, supported by a high degree of residential proximity between adult children and parents (5). Even when intergenerational families do not coreside, daily contacts are frequent. Many Italians prefer to live close to extended family, with over half of the population in the northern regions commuting (6). Intergenerational interactions, coresidence, and commuting may have accelerated the outbreak in Italy through social networks that increased the proximity of elderly to initial cases (7).",

The Korean outbreak was concentrated among the young Shincheonji religious group (3), with only 4.5% of cases thus far falling into the >80-y group (8). This contributed to a low overall CFR in South Korea relative to Italy (1.6% vs. 10.6%). Germany has, likewise, few deaths (583 out of 61,923 cases to date), with the median age of confirmed cases at 48 y compared to 62 y in Italy (9). COVID-19 transmission chains that begin in younger populations may go undetected longer (10), with countries slow to raise the alarm. The initial low CFR in England may have reflected the relatively young age structure of early infections, including Greater London, which has a small fraction of residents over 65 y compared to more rural areas (11). COVID-19 was only detected in King County, WA, once it reached the Life Care Center in Kirkland, where 19 out of 22 of the state's first reported COVID-19 deaths occurred, with virus genetic sequence estimates suggesting it circulated for several weeks prior (12). Once community transmission is established, countries with high intergenerational contacts may see faster transmissions to high-fatality age groups, as seen in Italy and Spain, leading to higher average CFR (13). The overall burden of serious cases and mortality reflects linkages between the age distribution of early cases, age structure of the population, and intergenerational connections.",

Adjusting assumptions changes the total number of expected deaths but not the relative comparisons across countries with different age structures. For example, assuming that CFRs, by age, are half of current Italian rates would reduce the numbers of expected deaths by half. Fig. 1, Top considers two countries, Italy and South Korea, with very different population age structures. The larger number of expected fatalities is clearly visible in Fig. 1, Top Right for Italy (302,530) versus Korea (177,822). In Fig. 1, Bottom, we consider two countries with similar population sizes but very different age distributions. Brazil has 2.0% of its population over age 80+ y, with our simulated scenario leading to dramatically more deaths (452,694) compared to Nigeria (142,056), where only 0.2% are 80+ y. Fig. 2 visualizes expected deaths by age groups in countries with different population age structures: Italy (older), United States (middle), and Nigeria (younger). We see stark implications of an older age structure for higher fatalities, amplified at higher population infection rates. SI Appendix, Fig. S1 animates differences by infection rate (0 to 100%).",

Population aging is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries, which, mercifully, may lessen the impact of this pandemic in lower-income countries with weaker health systems but younger age structures. It is plausible that poor general health status and coinfections such as HIV and tuberculosis will increase the danger of COVID-19 in these countries, along with intergenerational proximity and challenges to physical distancing. Thus far, the lower than expected number of cases detected in Africa (despite extensive trade and travel links with China) suggests that the young age structure may be protective of severe and thus detectable cases. Beyond age structure, demography can shed light on the large sex differences in COVID-19 mortality that need to be understood\u2014with men at higher risk. Distributions of underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will likewise refine risk estimates. Until more nuanced data are available, the concentration of mortality risk in the oldest old ages remains one of the best tools to predict the burden of critical cases and produce more precise planning of availability of hospital beds, staff, and other resources. Few countries are routinely releasing their COVID-19 data with key demographic information such age, sex, or comorbidities. We call for the timely release of these disaggregated data to allow researchers and governments to nowcast risk for more focused prevention and preparedness.",
