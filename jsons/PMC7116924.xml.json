            "text": "The acute phase response is an early immune response that is crucial for early immune defence against events such as inflammation, neoplasia, and infections (Cray et al., 2009). Early in infections, or during tissue damage, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released: IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 from affected cells and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 from mononuclear cells (van Miert, 1995, Heinrich et al., 1990). When cytokines reach the liver, they stimulate the hepatocytes to release acute phase proteins (APPs) into the blood stream (Heinrich et al., 1990). APPs circulate in the blood and help to stabilize the internal environment and speed the healing process (Cray et al., 2009). In response to inflammation, APPs may increase (positive APP) or decrease (negative APP) plasma protein levels. APPs in cattle include serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp).",

The clinical disease and subclinical effects can potentially result in long-term losses regarding animal health and production (Fitzgerald, 1980, Stockdale, 1981, Daugschies et al., 1986, Lassen and Ostergaard, 2012). After a sporulated oocyst has excysted in the gut, the parasite undergoes several asexual and sexual cycles of invasion and destruction of the intestinal cells. Eimeriosis due to Eimeria (E.) zuernii manifests as massive tissue damage accompanied by the release of oocysts 2\u20133 weeks after infection (Daugschies and Najdrowski, 2005). Changes in APP profiles may serve as a useful tool for estimating the health of calves by determining of the impact of pathogens, such as Eimeria, in the clinical and subclinical stages, and may potentially serve as a tool for prognosis of the severity of disease (Hashemnia et al., 2011).",

The animals were between 10 and 28 days old and were determined to be healthy by a veterinarian at the beginning of the experimental period based on observation of general animal behaviour, good overall health, body temperature between 38.5 \u00b0C and 39.5 \u00b0C, normal breathing, skin turgidity and heart auscultation, and presence of wounds and diarrhoea. All animals were weighed individually on a mobile scale once weekly in 7-day intervals starting on day 0 or 1 of the study, respectively, until the end of the study. Calves were divided into three infection groups: group 0 (n\n = 14), uninfected control calves; group 1 (n\n = 11), calves infected orally with 150,000 sporulated E. zuernii oocysts; and group 2 (n\n = 16), calves infected orally with 250,000 sporulated E. zuernii oocysts. Interference of E. coli K99 and Giardia were excluded at the onset of diarrhoea, or 18 day post infection (dpi) for controls, using antigen tests (FASTest E. coli K99 strip, and FASTest GIARDIA strip, Megacor, Hoerbranz, Austria). Samples taken simultaneously with the antigen tests were investigated to confirm absence of Cryptosporidium spp. using a carbol fuchsin staining technique (Heine 1982). Calves were kept under the same housing conditions (same feed, two calves per pen, same stable, and air-conditioned rooms). The infective material was isolated from a commercial farm, passaged in calves by experimental infection before use and determined to be comprised of greater than 97% E. zuernii oocysts and less than 3% Eimeria ellipsoidalis oocysts. Blood samples were collected in vacuum tubes (Vacuette\u00ae serum clot activator tubes, Greiner bio-one, Kremsmuenster, Austria) on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 14\u201328. Blood was drawn from all animals during the experimental period, except on days 3 and 9, upon which 10 and 30 calves were sampled, respectively. Faecal samples (50\u2013100 g) were collected on the sampling days by digital stimulation of the anus. The consistency was scored as: (1) normal to pasty, (2) semiliquid to liquid, (3) watery, and (4) haemorrhagic and/or with tissue according to Mundt et al. (2005). Oocyst excretion was determined using the quantitative McMaster method, as described previously (Thienpont et al., 1990, Bangoura and Daugschies, 2007b).",

            "text": "Clinical cattle eimeriosis gains its relevance mainly due to the resulting reduction in weight gain and increase in mortality. In the present study, reduced weight gain in infected animals was linked to the expression of both Hp and SAA during the onset of the patent period, and expression of Hp over the entire experimental period. This result supports the theory that the reduced weight gain commonly observed during eimeriosis is the result of an immunological reaction that coincides with the production of Hp and SAA at the time of clinical disease manifestation. Arthington et al. (2005) demonstrated previously the association between higher APP levels and reduced weight gain in beef calves, and studies in growing pigs demonstrated a negative relationship between Hp concentrations and body weight gain (Hiss and Sauerwein, 2003, Sauerwein et al., 2005). The negative association between APPs and weight gain could be explained by a decrease in food intake due to the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the central nervous system (Langhans and Hrupka, 1999). Alternatively, it could result from enhanced catabolism of body tissues (Webel et al., 1997). In experimental infection of goat kids with E. arloingi (Hashemnia et al., 2011), in both infection groups, SAA concentrations and increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were associated. This further supports the hypothesis that APPs and weight gain are associated via the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection.",

The concentrations of Hp increased as predicted, but only in group 2, and a dose-dependent difference between group 1 and 2 was observed for Hp (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the concentration of Hp also appeared to decline near the end of the 2-week patent period when the faecal oocyst excretion also declined. This supports the hypothesis of a relationship between the release of oocysts, resulting in tissue damage, the production of APPs, and inappetence, resulting in weight loss. However, changes in SAA concentrations during infection showed no clear association between the control group and group 1, or between the infection groups. At the same time, considerable fluctuations in SAA concentrations were observed during the prepatent period (Fig. 1), but generally above the reported median value (32 mg/l, min-max 2\u2013150 mg/l) for calves above 14 days of age using the same assay (Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2013). The different patterns of Hp and SAA concentrations observed in this study could be a reflection of the distinctive cytokine response of calves to E. zuernii infection, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 that are predominant pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate the hepatic synthesis of APPs (Baumann and Gauldie, 1994, Alsemgeest et al., 1996).",

Calves exhibit elevated concentrations of SAA, but not Hp, during the first 3 weeks after birth (Orro et al., 2008). The differences observed between calves infected with 250,000 oocysts compared to non-infected calves may be best explained by the naturally occuring changes in SAA early in the calves life. This appear to coinciding with the the timing of the prepatent period in the experiment, and less likely to be due to a rise in SAA concentrations in infection groups.",

            "text": "The immunological response to intestinal damage is crucial to initiate repair mechanisms and limit the loss of fluids, which has been observed during experimental infection with Eimeria bovis (Daugschies et al., 1988, Daugschies et al., 1997). It is possible that mild Eimeria infections causing less severe tissue damage may interact differently with the local immune response than massive infections associated with more severe tissue destruction. In the case of mild disease, APPs may be used locally to limit infection and initiate the repair process, leading to a transient systemic reduction in APP levels, while more severe damage may initiate a systemic up-regulation of APPs. The main function of Hp is binding of free haemoglobin (Eaton et al., 1982), and increased consumption of circulating Hp will increase during haemolysis. This may also be reflected by the observed reduction in Hp concentrations when less than 500 OPG were shed by calves, resembling mild tissue damage, but not for calves shedding more than 500 OPG. When more severe tissue damage occurs, stronger inflammatory stimulus will up-regulate the hepatic synthesis of Hp, and systemic concentrations will increase despite higher consumption of Hp due to haemorrhage. Higher levels of Hp, above the previously reported reference value for calves up to 2 months of age (<196 mg/l) (Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2013), were observed in haemorrhagic and diarrheic faeces in calves infected with 250,000 E. zuernii oocysts compared to calves in the same group with other faecal scores (Fig. 2). The presence of blood in the diarrhoea of calves with E. zuernii infection indicates tissue damage as a consequence of the release of oocysts that expose and potentially rupture intestinal capillaries (Blaxter and Wood, 1958). It is possible that the additional fluid loss, loss of haemoglobin, and presence of an acute inflammatory reaction due to haemorrhage increases the demand for Hp to speed up the repair of the tissue, resulting in the observed rise in Hp.",

This effect was observed mainly during the patent period. The rise in Hp and SAA was correlated with reduced weight gain in infected calves during the patent period. Thus, APPs are an indicator for clinically relevant cases of eimeriosis, but their diagnostic value is limited. In the future, investigation into the relationship between APPs and Eimeria infections at lower experimental infection doses, especially with regard to APP level progression during natural infections, will be necessary.",
