It also appears that clinicians were reluctant to stop antibiotics prior to discharge in children in whom other viruses were identified, even when these provide a plausible aetiological explanation for the child's LRTI. In our view, these represent missed opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship and many children are receiving courses of antibiotics that are too long. Rhedin et al. 2 recently reported that in children with acute respiratory tract infection hMPV, parainfluenza viruses and RSV were highly over-represented in children with respiratory tract symptoms compared with asymptomatic controls, suggesting that in a child with compatable symptoms and signs they are likely to be the cause of the LRTI.
