The foremost applications for gene delivery include the development of vaccines and therapeutics for several infectious or genetic diseases and cancers. For the success of a gene delivery platform, the two most important criteria are safety and efficiency. A tremendous increase in the knowledge of molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, and immunology from 1980 to 2014 has allowed remarkable progress in recombinant DNA technology, which has greatly influenced the development of novel vector systems both viral and nonviral.",

The most commonly used viral vectors in clinical trials are based on adenoviruses (AdVs), retroviruses, poxviruses, and herpesviruses. Of all gene therapy clinical trials, AdV vectors are currently the most commonly used gene delivery platform (http://www.abedia.com/wiley/vectors.php).",

The relatively less abundant proteins in AdV capsids are called minor capsid proteins and include the core proteins (Tp, V, VII, and mu) and the cement proteins (IIIa, VI, VIII, and IX). Depending on the species type, AdVs use a variety of receptors for cell entry and include the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), CD46, VCAM-1, CD80, CD86, heparin sulfate proteoglycans, desmoglein-2, and others.10., 11.\n",

Although AdVs are known to infect a wide range of species, they rarely cause a serious disease in an immune-competent host. Most HAdVs are associated with self-limiting disease in humans and may manifest as mild upper respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, or ear infections, depending on the HAdV species involved. In most instances, the severity of the disease is a function of the host\u2019s immune function.7 Their relatively innocuous nature makes AdVs particularly suitable for developing into a safe vector system. AdV vectors offer several other advantages including (1) the ability to infect a wide range of dividing and nondividing mammalian cells; (2) a robust transgene expression that can be restricted to a specific tissue by employing a tissue specific promoter; (3) the fact that they are easy to generate and can be grown to high titers; (5) their inability to integrate into host genome with a minimal risk of insertional mutagenesis; (6) the induction of strong humoral and cellular adaptive immune response to the transgene; and (7) strong activation of the innate immune response to provide an adjuvant effect that can potentiate booster immunity and may be desirable in vaccine applications.12\n",

Given that the natural exposure to HAdVs can be highly variable, the level of preexisting AdV immunity is expected to vary among individuals and human populations making the efficacy of HAdV vectors in clinical trials unpredictable. The high immunogenicity of AdV vectors implies that a first inoculation with an AdV vector will result in AdV serotype-specific immune responses that will preclude subsequent use of the same AdV serotype.

The major epitopes for anti-hexon nAbs are located in the exposed loops, also known as hypervariable regions, located on the surface of the virus particle.23 The nAbs bind to the AdV vector in the blood, preventing its binding to the cell surface and subsequent internalization, thus resulting in rapid clearance from the host. The end result is a drastic reduction in transgene expression and an induction of transgene-specific immune responses. Such blunting of the efficacy of HAdV-5 vectors in the presence of preexisting immunity has been demonstrated by generating artificial serotype-specific immunity in animals preinoculated with HAdV-5.24., 25., 26. The nonneutralizing, but cross-reactive, anti-HAdV antibodies are generated after repeated administration or infections with the same AdV serotype.26 The nonneutralizing antibodies can also significantly reduce the transgene expression through Fc receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms resulting in poor efficacy of the AdV vector.27\n",

The presence of vector-specific CD8 T cells causes cytolysis and elimination of the vector-transduced cells, while the CD4+ T cells will potentiate the humoral immune response to the vector.",

The pattern recognition receptors (PRR) involved in the recognition of AdV vectors receptors include Toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 9, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, Factor X, and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1.28., 43. Binding of AdVs to PRR results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB culminating in the production of proinflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1/\u03b2, IP-10, RANTES, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.28., 41. The AdV-induced innate immune response may be beneficial for targeted cancer gene therapy and vaccine applications where the goal is to eliminate the AdV vector-transduced cells and generate a robust immune response. However, activation of innate immune responses can result in rapid destruction of AdV-transduced cells, thus reducing the transgene expression. Furthermore, intravenous inoculations of large doses of AdV vectors can also have life-threatening consequences mediated by strong activation of innate immune reactions.44\n",

In a heterologous prime\u2013boost regimen, a chAdV-63 vector in combination with a plasmid DNA or modified vaccinia vector Ankara (MVA) as a vaccine for delivering HIVconsv was evaluated in uninfected human subjects.84 The HIVconsv is based on the 14 functionally most conserved subprotein domains of HIV-1 and is common to most virus variants worldwide.85., 86., 87., 88. The combinatorial regimen that included the chAd63.HIVconsv resulted in an HIVconsv-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells with remarkably high frequencies. Furthermore, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with broad specificity and multiple intercellular signaling molecules were induced. In addition, the effector T cells which were found to be specific for gag and pol were efficacious in inhibiting HIV-1 replication in cultured autologous CD4+ T cells by a factor of 5.79 log. No adverse side effects were reported in any of the subjects receiving the vaccine formulation.84 A follow-up Phase I clinical trial HIV-CORE 002 with the same combinatorial regimens discussed above did not report significant safety or tolerability concerns.89 Only mild-to-moderate local reactogenicity and systemic effects such as mild pain, erythema, fever, and headache lasting for fewer than 3 days postadministration were described in the majority of vaccines receiving chAd63.HIVconsv. Following these encouraging results, a Phase I clinical trial using chAd63.HIVconsv and MVA.HIVconsv is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01712425).",

Furthermore, both viral vectors were able to induce broad T cell responses, targeting peptides encompassing multiple viral gene products including NS3, NS4A/B, NS5A, and NS5B. The induced T cell responses for each vector included both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with the CD8+ response being the more dominant of the two. T cell populations secreting IFN-\u03b3/TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3/IL-2, or all three cytokines were detected with a minimal IL17A response. In addition, the induced T cells responses were found to be cross-reactive with other HCV genotypes 1A, 3A, and 1B with genotype 1B representing the immunogen. Finally, detectable and functional memory T cell could be observed up to one year postboost, suggesting that the vaccines induced a long-lasting T cell response.104\n",

The poorer chAdV-3 prime/HAdV-6 boost response is surprising given the strong and functional responses at priming.

Unlike HAdV-5, BAdV-3 is a strong inducer of TLR4. There is an absence of Kupffer cell depletion with BAdV-3 in mice123 while Kupffer cell depletion with HAdV-5 is the main reason for a faster vector depletion from the host. Intravenous inoculation with a BAdV-3 vector efficiently transduces the heart, kidney, lung, liver, and spleen. The vector persists for a longer duration compared to a HAdV-5 vector especially in the heart, kidney, and lung in a mouse model.122 Sequential administration of HAdV-5 and BAdV-3 vectors overcomes vector immunity in an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer.124 Persistence of the BAdV-3 genome in human and nonhuman cell lines is similar to that of the HAdV-5 vectors.125 These various findings underscore why BAdV-3 vectors offer an attractive alternative to HAdV vectors for effectively immunizing individuals with high levels of preexisting HAdV immunity with safety aspects similar to those of HAdV-5 vectors.",

In the presence of exceptionally high levels of preexisting vector immunity, mice immunized with BAd-H5HA resulted in approximately 2.8-fold higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers or a 2.3-fold higher percentage of HA-specific CD8+ T cells compared to the levels in na\u00efve mice inoculated with HAd-H5HA. The immunization of na\u00efve or HAdV-primed mice with BAd-H5HA resulted in full protection from morbidity and mortality following a potentially lethal challenge with A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1). Furthermore, a heterologous prime\u2013boost regimen comprised of HAd-H5HA priming and boosting with BAd-H5HA elicited a significantly higher HI response compared with HAd-H5HA or BAd-H5HA alone. These results strongly suggest the importance of using BAdV-based vectors as an alternate to HAdV-based vectors for eluding preexisting vector immunity and in a heterologous prime\u2013boost strategy for enhanced immune responses.",

Both replication-competent (containing deletion in E3 region) and replication-defective (containing deletions in E1 and/or E3 regions) PAdV vectors have been developed and evaluated as delivery tools for vaccine or gene therapy purposes.135 A PAdV-3-based classical swine fever virus (CSFV) vaccine (rPAV-gp55) containing the gp55 (E2) gene from the CSFV \u2018Weybridge\u2019 strain into the right-hand end of the PAdV-3 genome has been developed.136 Transgene expression was driven from the major late promoter and tripartite leader sequences of PAdV-3. Subcutaneous vaccination of outbred pigs with a single dose of the rPAV-gp55 vaccine induced high levels of gp55-specific antibodies and conferred complete protection from lethal challenge with CSFV. Furthermore, all the vaccinated animals showed no adverse clinical signs of CSFV. In a subsequent study, 6-week-old weaned pigs and 7-day-old preweaned piglets were vaccinated with a DNA vaccine expressing the gp55/E2 gene from CSFV and then boosted with rPAV-gp55.137 This prime\u2013boost vaccine approach induced high levels of gp55 antibody titers. Following challenge with CFSV, 100% of the weaned pigs and 75% of preweaned piglets were protected.",

The strategy employed for constructing CAdV-2 vectors involves homologous recombination between the viral genome and a shuttle vector carrying a transgene expression cassette along with other necessary sequences, and is similar to that used for generating HAdV vectors.158., 159. The E1-deleted CAdV-2 vectors cannot be trans-complemented by cell lines expressing human E1, necessitating the development of canine kidney cell lines expressing the CAdV-2 E1.157., 158. The E1-deleted CAdV-2 vectors can be grown to high titers (1013\n vp/ml) and seem to have an excellent infectious particles-to-virus particles ratio.158 However, the initial system for CAdV-2 vector development was cumbersome and very inefficient, often resulting in a CAdV-2 vector titer that was 104- to 105-fold lower than that of a HAdV-5 vector. Apparently this was because the canine kidney cells are difficult to transfect with linear CAdV-2 vector genomes of >30 kb.157 Recently, an improved system for CAdV-2 vector generation has been described that uses a canine kidney cell line trans-complementing the CAdV-2 E1 and expressing I-SceI fused to estrogen receptor.160 This system allows highly efficient transfection of the supercoiled CAdV-2 vector genome into the canine kidney cells followed by an intracellular release of the vector genome and results in a 1000-fold increase in CAdV-2 vector titers.",

Apart from a temporary corneal edema that lasted for \u223c24 h, no major complication occurred. The CAdV-2 vector transduction was as efficient, if not more, as that of the HAdV-5 vector. It covered the entire cornea but declined after 1 week, suggesting that further improvements are necessary to obtain long-term expression. Interestingly, the CAdV-2 vector induced a histological correction of GAG and cell morphology in the canine cornea, possibly due to the CAR expression by keratocytes and a high-level expression of \u03b2-glu by the vector.172 In addition, the HD-RIGIE could also reverse neuropathological changes associated with MPS VII in the dog\u2019s brain.173 This HD-RIGIE has the potential to induce long-term \u03b2-glu expression in mice, resulting in decreased GAG levels, lysosomal enzyme activity, and most importantly, a dramatic improvement in cognitive function.174 For these reasons, HD CAdV-2 vectors can potentially provide tools for therapy of MPS VII and other lysosomal storage diseases.",

In addition, cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate is also involved in MAdV-1 infection.186., 187. MAdV-1 binds to primary human smooth muscles with significantly higher affinity than HAdV-5. The biodistribution of MAdV-1 is not altered by the presence of physiological concentrations of coagulation factor XI or the vitamin K-dependent factors that play a role in the targeting of HAdV-5 to the liver.

Three aviadenoviruses (FAdV-1, FAdV-8, and FAdV-10) have been evaluated as gene delivery vectors for vaccination. A FAdV-10 vector containing the VP2 gene from the Australian classical strain 002/73 of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has been generated.197 Vaccination of specific pathogen-free chickens with this FAdV10-based vaccine induced VP2-specific antibodies that protected chickens against challenge with the IBDV V877 strain. A FAdV-1-based vector has been evaluated for cancer gene therapy and demonstrated efficient transduction of several human cells including HepG2, A549, and primary human dermal fibroblasts.198 In another study, a FAdV-8-based vaccine was developed against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) after incorporating the spike peplomer S1 subunit from the IBV Vic S strain under the control of the FAdV major late promoter.199 Using this FAdV-8 vector-based vaccine, immunization of commercial broiler chickens induced S1-specific antibody responses and conferred protection against challenge with either Vic S (serotype B) or N1/62 (serotype C) strains of IBV. A FAdV-8 vector expressing cytokines including chicken IFN-\u03b3 has been developed and evaluated to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines in chickens.200\n",

In addition to effectively circumventing preexisting HAdV immunity, these nonhuman AdV vectors can utilize a number of other receptors in addition to CAR for vector internalization, thereby expanding the range of cell types that can be targeted. The safety aspects of these vectors appear to be similar to or better than HAdV vectors. In addition to their utility for human applications, nonhuman AdV vectors also provide excellent platforms for veterinary vaccines. A specific nonhuman AdV vector when used in its species of origin could provide an excellent animal model for evaluating the efficacy and pathogenesis of these vectors.",

In situations where multiple vector inoculations are required for a desired effect, nonhuman AdV vectors could supplement HAdV or other viral vectors. Only SAdV vectors can be grown in certified human cell lines that are used for HAdV replication and purification; therefore, there is a need to certify a number of other cell lines that are suitable for growing and purifying other nonhuman AdV vectors. To fully exploit the desired impact of using nonhuman AdVs, further changes in nonhuman AdV vector design will be necessary.",
