A total of 512.05 million livestock are present in India and most of these are reared by landless and marginal farmers and are the main source of their livelihood. Besides, organized sectors have also started showing interest in livestock farming; mainly in poultry and dairy sectors but their numbers are very small at the present. As livestock sector is a live market, they are very susceptible to different infectious diseases such as viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. These infectious diseases are posing a threat to the livestock production performance due to morbidity and mortality. Therefore keeping the livestock healthy to get better production is of paramount importance to agricultural economy. Vaccination of the animals against various infectious diseases prevailing in different geographical regions is the key measure of good husbandry practices and contributes a major role in maintaining animal health and minimizing economic losses due to production losses from infectious diseases.",

Around a century after him, Luis Pasteur made three vaccines for rabies, fowl cholera, and anthrax through the process of attenuation. Further, in 1886 Daniel Elmer Salmon and Theobald Smith gave the concept of inactivated or killed vaccine. Presently most of the vaccines used for immunization of animals or humans are either live or inactivated in nature. The conventional veterinary vaccines protect animals against the potential dangers of many infectious diseases. It stimulates the animal\u2019s immune system and prepares them to resist the infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the transmission and the spread of animal disease epidemics which subsequently provide full security and public health.\n",

Vaccines against other diseases like brucellosis, rabies, foot and mouth disease (FMD) are being used as the main instruments in the eradication program of the respective diseases globally.

A number of genetically-engineered vaccines which are rationally designed such as, live flavivirus chimera vaccine (WN-FV) (PreveNile), live double-gene deleted [deleted glycoprotein E (gE\u2212) and deleted thymidine kinase (tk\u2212)] bovine herpesirus type 1 strain (Hiprabovis IBR Marker), and feline immune deficiency vaccine (Fel-O-Vax) have already been introduced in the veterinary market.",

The vaccine against all pathogens is not available as there are some existing limitations in developed vaccines or difficulties in vaccine development. Reasons for unavailability of vaccines for certain diseases include that either it is not technically possible to develop vaccines that provide adequate protection against the etiological agent or it is not possible to develop safe and effective vaccines, or it may become ineffective in a short duration as pathogens change their characteristics. The vaccination cannot always be a universal option for control of animal epidemics. Many countries have vaccines against most viral or bacterial diseases but lack vaccines against parasitic diseases.

The objective of \u201cone health\u201d is to promote multisectoral response to food safety hazards, the risk from zoonotic diseases and its control (disease that can spread between animals and humans, e.g., rabies, West Nile fever, salmonella, and flu) (Vandersmissen and Welburn, 2014, Buttigieg, 2015). One health activity also includes public health threats at the human-animal-ecosystem interface (antibiotic resistance) and provides guidance on how to reduce these risks (Vandersmissen and Welburn, 2014, Hoelzer et al., 2018).",

There are limited numbers of effective antibiotics for treatment against bacterial diseases but the possibilities of getting resistant against these are still a concern. Vaccine acts on the bacteria by eliciting host-immune response either through humoral or cell-mediated immunity and there is no possibility to get resistance against host immunity (Vandersmissen and Welburn, 2014, Hoelzer et al., 2018). Therefore vaccination is a safe and effective method to prevent bacterial infection in animals and humans.

Generally, they are produced by serial passages of agents in unnatural or heterologous hosts or cell lines and sometimes distant relative of pathogenic microorganisms which are not pathogenic to the target host (Jorge and Dellagostin, 2017). Viruses acquire random mutations in their genome after multiple serial passages in heterologous systems leading to loss of pathogenicity without compromise in immunogenicity (Meeusen et al., 2007). They are able to replicate in the host and induce both cellular and humoral immunity. The immunity generated by live vaccines persist a longer duration and there is no need for adjuvant (van Gelder and Makoschey, 2012, Jorge and Dellagostin, 2017). The limitations of live vaccines are adverse reaction and reversion of virulence inside the host. Besides, they have less shelf-life and are sensitive to high temperature. Therefore they require cold chain or refrigeration for storage and transportation.

These vaccines are comparatively easy to produce than live vaccines but provide a shorter duration of immunity. Further, most of the viruses have multiple serotypes or continuously changing antigenic structures (e.g., FMD virus and influenza viruses) and one serotype does not provide protection to other serotypes, therefore, vaccine candidates for inactivated vaccines should be continuously evaluated to provide coverage against the outbreaks.

Compared to conventional vaccines, these vaccines are safe to administer, nonreplicating, easy to produce, cost effective, and have no deleterious effect due to unwanted antigenic materials. They can be made by isolating antigenic protein(s) from any infectious organism after its disruption. This type of strategy is common in aviral subunit vaccine called split vaccine. The recombinant subunit vaccines are made by identification and selection of protective antigen gene coding region followed by their cloning in suitable vector and expression in a heterologous host system such as bacteria, yeast, mammalian and insect. Escherichia coli is used extensively for protein expression as heterologous host besides limitation in the form of yield, posttranslational modification and folding of expressed recombinant proteins. The limitations of E. coli expression system were improved by the introduction of methylotropic yeast (Pichia pastoris) which has the capacity of posttranslational modification and folding of expressed recombinant proteins. Since the subunit vaccines induce less immunity in comparison to whole bacteria or viral vaccine, they are used with a suitable adjuvant. Examples of such include Newcastle disease virus (NDV) subunit vaccine using hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene, FMDV subunit vaccine using VP-1 gene, porcine circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) subunit vaccine based on open reading frame-2 (commercialized) and prM, and E envelope protein-based subunit vaccine of Japanese encephalitis.",

Further, they are safe due to the absence of genome and provide a high degree of protection without the possibility of reversion of virulence. They could provide a promising differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy during serosurveillance and eradication program of disease. Therefore they may be a better substitute for inactivated and live vaccines. VLP has been successfully employed in two licensed vaccines, hepatitis B and human papilloma virus but there is no report of licensed veterinary vaccine until now.",

The live vectors are attenuated virus or bacteria which act as a backbone to deliver large amounts of exogenous gene inside the host (Jorge and Dellagostin, 2017). A number of viruses (vaccinia virus, canary pox, fowlpox, and adenovirus) and bacteria [Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Shigellae spp.] have been tested for their capability to carry the heterologous genes and their expression inside the host (Rizzi et al., 2012). They provide long lasting immunity due to being viable in nature and because they do not need any adjuvant. Currently, the canary poxvirus vector system has been used for vaccines against rabies virus, canine distemper virus, feline leukemia virus, and equine influenza virus. The bacterial recombinant BCG has significant potential to express a large number of antigens and can induce solid immunity. The use of transgenic plants engineered to produce and deliver immunogenic antigens via food sources has potential perspective in vaccine industries. In veterinary vaccinology, transgenic plants are able to produce and deliver antigens through animal feed. Plant-based vaccine trials have been conducted for various parasitic diseases including poultry coccidiosis, schistosomosis, porcine cysticercosis, and ascariosis. Plant-derived rabies G protein expressed in tomato, tobacco, and spinach on oral administration in mice mount local and systemic immune response (Shams, 2005). Besides, in attempt to form edible vaccine for rabies, vaccinia, canarypox, adenovirus, and yeast; they were employed for expression of neutralizing G protein of rabies and used as a delivery system. Rabies vaccine in the form of consumable bait (edible vaccine; raboral V-RG coated in fishmeal and fish oil) was successfully used for vaccination of wildlife such as raccoon, fox, etc.",

In addition to a desired exogenous antigenic gene, the plasmid contains a strong eukaryotic promoter, polyA tail, multiple cloning sites, and suitable selective marker. The basic aim of DNA vaccine system is that the antigen can be expressed directly by the cells of the host in a way similar to that occurring during viral infection and expressed antigen after processing will be represented either via major histocompatibility complex-I or major histocompatibility complex-II leading to cellular and humoral immune responses (Shi et al., 2014, Meeusen et al., 2007). They are easy to manufacture, have low cost, and do not require cold chain facility. DNA vaccines were administrated either by intramuscular (I/M) injection or using a DNA particle delivery system called gene gun. Immunization of animals with DNA vaccine is comparatively safer than the use of other conventional vaccines as later unnecessarily expose the host to a wide variety of antigen (Jorge and Dellagostin, 2017). However, there is concern regarding possible integration of DNA in the host genome and might be inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. A few examples of DNA vaccines are West Nile virus vaccine (first approved DNA vaccine), influenza virus DNA vaccine (passed clinical trial for ponies), and feline immune deficiency virus.",

Although, antibiotics is the main therapeutic to treat the disease and control the incidence of such microbial infection, remains of antibiotics in animal products and antibiotic resistance are the drawback of antibiotics use. The other alternative to control and prevention of HS is by vaccination of animals in endemic areas prior to the expected outbreak of HS. Immunity generated in HS is serotype-specific therefore selection of vaccine candidates depend upon circulating serotypes in that geographical regions. Various strategies have been used to develop HS vaccines such as killed vaccines (bacterins), live-attenuated, cellular vaccines, and genetically-engineered vaccines (Myint et al., 1987, Verma and Jaiswal, 1998, Hodgson et al., 2005). But killed vaccines are used commonly for the vaccination against HS. Bacterins used against HS include formalized bacterin, aluminum hydroxide gel, and oil adjuvant vaccines (OIE, 2017). Among these, aluminum hydroxide gel vaccine and oil adjuvant vaccines elicit a good immune response in the studies conducted in many Asian countries including India during the last few years, and are the vaccine of choice.",

Disease has wide host range and it is primarily caused by Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis in large (cattle) and small ruminant (goat) respectively (OIE, 2017). Abortions in late gestation, placentitis, epididymitis, and orchitis are the most common consequences. Direct or indirect contact and consumption of products from infected animals act as a source of human brucellosis. Therefore WHO, OIE, and other agencies collectively set a plan under one health program to control the brucellosis. Animal brucellosis can be prevented by applying good managemental and hygienic practices. Countries having a low prevalence of brucellosis are following the test and slaughter policy while it is not economical in highly endemic counties and vaccination is the only option. Currently, live-attenuated B. abortus strain 19 and RB-51 are used for immunization of cattle while B. melitensis Rev 1 is used for sheep and goat (Moriy\u00f3n et al., 2004, Corbel, 2006, Zhang et al., 2018). Most of the countries are using B. abortus strain 19 to immunize cattle because of its high protective efficacy, although it induces abortion in pregnant animals and is not capable of DIVA. While RB-51 is not abortogenic and capable of DIVA strategy due to lack of O-antigen of LPS and has similar protective efficacy. New generation vaccine strains based on attenuation organism, protein subunit, and DNA fragments were also tested experimentally to get safer vaccines (Golshani and Buozari, 2017) but none of them are yet commercialized for immunization purpose. Further, killed B. abortus 45/20 and B. melitensis H38 are also available but are less protective (Schurig et al., 2002, Plommet et al., 1970).",

It generally affects unvaccinated healthy cattle of 6\u201324 months of age causing high mortality and significant economic loss. Blackleg is a preventable disease and formalin-treated culture of C. chauvoei formulated with alum as an adjuvant and chemically toxoid culture supernatant are used worldwide for immunization of susceptible groups (Uzal, 2012). Additionally, purified flagellin, crude cell wall proteins, and recombinant CctA were also shown to be promising antigens to induce protective immunity (Frey and Falquet, 2015).",

Leptospirosis is a major public health important disease in developing, improvised countries and causes huge production loss in animal husbandry. Current vaccines used for immunization are based on whole cell killed preparation (bacterin), cell membrane extract, and purified outer envelope (Bolin et al., 1991, Cullen et al., 2002, Bharti et al., 2003). Most killed vaccines are of animal use while very few are licensed for human use. The immunity of Leptospira is serovar-specific and there are so many types of serovars present worldwide therefore multivalent bacterin formulations having locally prevalent serovar are used for immunization of cattle, pigs, and dogs worldwide (Bolin et al., 1991). Some recombinant vaccines based on outer membrane proteins, leptospira immunoglobuline-like proteins, and lipoproteins of leptospira were also experimentally evaluated but none of them are available for immunization purpose (Silveira et al., 2017; Faine et al., 1999; Levett, 2001).",

Both diseases are collectively causing huge economic loss of the dairy industry worldwide. M. bovis also causes infection in human beings and is one of the major zoonosis concerns of the present time (Grang, 2001). Besides, M. tuberculosis, a pathogen of humans may also infect domestic animals and these infected animals become the source of its further transmission to other susceptible animals and human beings. This phenomenon is called reverse zoonosis. Mycobacterial infection shows synergism with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in human beings and HIV/M. tuberculosis (dangerous couple model) copandemic is occurring and claiming million of lives each year (Shankar et al., 2014). Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic inflammatory intestinal condition of human beings is considered to be caused by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Good management practices and test and slaughter policy are used for the control and prevention of these diseases in bovines. The efficacy of a live vaccine made from the attenuated strain of M. bovis, BCG has proven variable and use of this vaccine might hinder the interpretation of current diagnostic tests (Balseiro et al., 2017, Cousins, 2001).",

In bovine, the disease is characterized by septicemia, acute or chronic enteritis and abortions (Kemal, 2014). Bovine salmonellosis is caused by Salmonella Dublin and Salmonella typhimurium. Salmonellosis has a significant economic impact on dairy and beef farming due to poor quality of milk and meat (McEvoy et al., 2003). Besides, it also possesses human health concerns due to the consumption of contaminated meat and milk, and close contact of the animal\u2019s handlers and veterinarians. Further, Salmonella isolates particularly S. typhimurium definitive type 104 and have develops resistance to multiple antibiotics and can act as donor for resistant determinant to other opportunistic bacteria found as commensal in intestine (Piddock, 2002). Therefore to avoid possibility of evolution of new resistant bacteria and disease manifestation in animals and humans, vaccination is the most important tool along with good animal husbandry practices. Both inactivated and modified live (MLV) Salmonella vaccines are licensed for immunization of cattle (Danielle, 2006, Adem and Bushra, 2016). Most of the inactivated commercial vaccines are bivalent in nature and have S. Dublin and S. typhimurium formulated with suitable adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide). A genetically- altered aroA mutant S. Dublin live vaccine is also used for immunization of farm animals in different developed countries (Duncan et al., 1987). Further, gram-negative core antigen bacterins such as ENDOVAC-Bovi (S. typhimurium lacking polysaccharide repeat of LPS) and J5 or J5-VAC (LPS core antigen made from mutant strain of E. coli) are commercially available, and it is claiming that they can cross protect animals from other endotoxin-producing bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella, P. multocida, and Manheimia hemolytica. Besides, autogenous vaccines are also recommended to protect animals on the basis of prevalent Salmonella types on farms.\n",

Generally, healthy animals act as a reservoir of E. coli and asymptomatically shed the E. coli in the environment. Pathogenic E. coli of animals (cattle, sheep, pig, and goat, etc.) are diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC), uropathogenic E. coli, septicemic E. coli, [includes avian-pathogenic E. coli], and the mammary-pathogenic E. coli. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) producing enterotoxins in pigs and ruminants leads to hyper-secretary diarrhea and electrolytes loss, and the enteropathogenic E. coli causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in most mammals come under the DEC (Hebbelstrup Jensen et al., 2014). E. coli producing Shiga toxin STx2e (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, STEC, verotoxigenic E. coli or VTEC), is the cause of edema disease in pigs, whereas cattle that produce STx and A/E lesions cause subclinical or nonclinical infections in ruminants (Smith, 2014). Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) causes severe illness in children and the elderly. Clinical sings depend upon types of infections in animals. Clinical manifestations caused by E. coli infection are enteric colibacilosis, colisepticaemia, edema disease, and coliform mastitis, etc. in young (calves, lambs, chicks, and piglets) and adult animals, leading to economic losses (Stein and Katz, 2017). Besides, infected animals are also a potential source for human infections. ETEC infection is a noninvasive type of gastrointestinal infection, and mucosal immunity plays an important role in colonization of these bacteria. Therefore killed bacteria with fimbria or extracted fimbria with or without LT toxoid (heat labile enterotoxin) are used for immunization of dams before parturition. Commercial vaccines for cows include E. coli F5 isolates or F5 adhesin while purified F4, F5, F6, or F41 fimbria or killed E. coli expressing these fimbriae with or without LT toxoid are used for immunization of sows. Further, live-attenuated, oral subunit vaccine having purified fimbria and poly (lactide co glycolide) (PLGA)-encapsulated fimbria or live vaccine was also evaluated for prevention of colonization (Edelman et al., 1993). For prevention of EHEC, whole bacteria, adhesin-intimin, fimbria, type III secretion system were tried (Smith, 2014) and the most successful vaccine is live recombinant Salmonella Dublin expressing E. coli O157:H7 intimin (Khare et al., 2010). Recently, SPR vaccine (bacterial extract siderophore receptor and porin, SRP technology) targeting E. coli O157 serotype is licensed for use in cattle to reduce the amount of E. coli O157 pathogen (Fox et al., 2009).",

The disease is characterized by high fever, lameness, formation of blister on mucosa of mouth, tongue, teats, and hoof. The disease has high morbidity and low mortality and affects all age groups of cattle. Due to high morbidity, the disease causes massive production loss and is considered as an economically important disease and a threat to livestock production worldwide. For the control of disease, virus (harvested from BHK-21 cell line) inactivated with binary-ethyleneimine is formulated with saponin/aluminum hydroxide or various oil-based adjuvant is used to potentiate the protective immune response in susceptible animals (Grubman and Baxt, 2004). Immunity induces by one serotype or subtype does not protect animals from other serotypes or subtypes of FMDV infection. Therefore which serotype or subtype is used as a vaccine candidate depends on the circulating FMDV type in that geographical areas/ countries. In India, trivalent vaccine having \u201cO, Asia-1 and A\u201d serotypes are being used for vaccination of cattle and buffaloes (Jamal and Belsham, 2013). Different FMDV eradication programs were launched in various countries, and disease was successfully eliminated from Western Europe and part of South America. But, the disease is still circulating in most parts of the world and posing a constant threat to dairy husbandry. Further, low quality vaccines, the simultaneous presence of various circulating types of FMDV in different countries and wildlife reservoir (African buffalo) are the main constraints in the control and eradication of this dreaded disease.",

            "text": "Rabies is a neglected zoonotic fatal disease of warm-blooded animals including human beings, and caused by rabies virus. It is associated with exposure of rabid animals, and incubation period of the disease depends on the extent of bite, site of bite from the brain, and quantum of virus entered by saliva at the bite wound (Blanton et al., 2009). The disease is reported from all the geographical areas of the world except Antarctica and has around 100% mortality in humans and animals. Over the last 100 years, a number of vaccines such as inactivated, MLV, and recombinant have been developed for the control and prevention of disease (Muller et al., 2001, Xiang et al., 2003, Singh et al., 2017). The neural origin vaccines have been discontinued due to their adverse effects and use of animals for the propagation of the virus. Nowadays modern vaccines, cell culture, and embryonated egg-based inactivated vaccines (Beta-propiolactone) are being used prophylactically (preexposure) and therapeutically (postexposure) to protect humans and animals against rabies (Singh et al., 2017). These modern vaccines are now available in most developing countries and have been successful to minimize the number of human exposures. Further, recombinant vaccines lack residual pathogenicity caused by rabies because they contain only single nonvirulent gene products. Various vectors such as animal poxvirus, human and canine adenoviruses encoding rabies virus glycoprotein G have been tested in different targets (dog, cat, fox, and raccoon) and nontarget wild animals via oral route (rabbit, deer, etc.). Among these vaccines, a vaccinia-based recombinant vaccine is used for immunization of wild animals as edible bait and are playing an important role in the prevention of rabies virus from wild animals to other domestic animals and humans (Yang et al., 2013). The oral vaccines are Raboral V-RG (vaccinia recombinant virus expressing G protein) and with Rabigen SAG2 (double mutant avirulent strain SAG2).",

The disease is markedly evident in goats. Goats are more susceptible to PPR compared to sheep. Transmission occurs by direct contact of infected goats and sheep, through contaminated food, water, beddings, and feces. The disease may spread in a flock through the introduction of newly purchased sick animals from the market. The disease has a serious economic impact in terms of high morbidity and mortality as well as reduces production ability. Vaccination is the most effective way to control PPR. An earlier practice to control the disease was to immunize the animals with Plowright\u2019s live-attenuated tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (heterologous vaccine) but its use was stopped due to hindrance in the serosurveillance of rinderpest (Muthuchelvan et al., 2015). Further, homologous PPR virus was used after passage in vero cell line. Presently, Nigeria75/1 strain of Africa, Sungri-96 strain isolated from goats developed by IVRI, Mukteswar or Arasur-87 strain of peste-des-petits ruminants (PPRV) isolated from sheep by TANUVAS are used for immunization of goat and sheep (Diallo et al., 1989, Diallo et al., 2007, Palaniswami et al., 2005, Singh et al., 2004). These vaccines are efficacious, safe, and provide a long-term protection to small ruminants.",

It is caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV) which has at least 27 different serotypes worldwide. The disease is transmitted by Culicoides species and affects mostly sheep, goats, and rarely cattle (Chand et al., 2015, Mayo et al., 2017). The disease is prevalent in rainy seasons. For the control of disease besides management practice as well as vector control, immunization of susceptible animals is a more effective strategy. Presently, MLV vaccine and inactivated vaccines are used for the control of the disease in various continents of the world (Bhanuprakash et al., 2009, Chand et al., 2015). As the immunity in BTV is serotype-specific and there are so many circulating serotypes in a geographical area at a time, the vaccine formulation is very difficult and challenging. Because of this reason, multivalent vaccines are used for immunization of animals. MLV vaccine produces viremia in animals which leads to further transmission of the virus and causes abortion, therefore this vaccine is generally not recommended for vaccination. Most of the countries are using inactivated BTV virus using BEI and hydroxylamine (Ramakrishnan et al., 2006). Presently in India pentavalent vaccine having BTV-1, 2, 10, 16, and 23 serotypes are used for the vaccination (Reddy et al., 2010). VLP-based genetically-engineered vaccine was also attempted but due to serotype-specific immunity and genetic drift in serotypes, this strategy was not successful (Chand et al., 2015).",

Most strains are host-specific and cause severe clinical manifestations in sheep or goat while some strains are equally virulent in both sheep and goats. For the prevention of disease both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are available, however inactivated vaccine provides a short duration of protection (Bhanuprakash et al., 2012, Boumart et al., 2016). Live-attenuated vaccine elicits long-term protection against SPV and GPV but its use is limited due to stimulation of pock lesion or death for some animals. Usually, the homologous vaccination strategy is useful for the protection of animals and locally prevalent strains are used as vaccine strains for immunization of sheep and goats (Rao and Bandyopadhyay, 2000). In India, live-attenuated vaccine incorporated with RM-65 strain for sheep pox and Uttarkashi strain of goat pox is currently used for immunization of sheep and goats, respectively (Madhavan et al., 2016).",

The causative agent of this vector-born disease is Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of genus Flavivirus and transmitted by thebite of Culex mosquitoes (Basu and Dutta, 2017). Generally, JEV maintained in a natural cycle between mosquitoes and water bird, and pig acts as an amplifying host (Yun and Lee, 2014). Accidentally, at peak of mosquitoes\u2019 prevalence in rainy seasons, the virus also infects dead-end hosts; human and horse due to mosquitoes\u2019 bite. Infections in pigs lead to significant reproductive problems causing abortion, still-birth, and birth defects while horses suffer from pyrexia and neurological manifestations leading to death (Lindahl et al., 2013). Both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are available for pigs, horses, and humans. MLV [produced in hamster or swine kidney tissue culture or hamster lung (HmLu) cell line] and inactivated (prepared in mouse brain, chicken embryo eggs, or cell lines, e.g., vero cells) are used for immunization of pigs and horses (Basu and Dutta, 2017). A genetically-engineered JE vaccine that combines the attenuated JEV strain and yellow fever vaccine virus is also available for humans (Janewongwirot et al., 2016).",

            "text": "It is an economically important infectious disease that affects a wide range of animals belonging to order Artyodactyla, including cattle, sheep, goat, camel, pig, and other domestic and wild ruminants, manifested with reproductive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal alignments. The disease is enlisted in the OIE. The disease is caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus-2 (BVDV-2) belong to genus Pestivirus of Flaviviridae family. At present at least 21 (BVDV-1a\u20131u) and 4 (BVDV2a\u20132d) subgenotypes of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, respectively have been identified. On the basis of cytopathic effect on cell culture, each genotype is further classified into cytopathic (CP) and noncytopathic (NCP) biotypes. The clinical infections are of, acute and transient infection in immune-compromised cattle and persistent infection in new born calf when the virus infects the dam in the first trimester of gestation (before the development of the immune system) and chronic infection due to the invasion of virus in immune-privileged sites. The persistently infected (PI) animals act as a major source of disease transmission in the herd due to constant shedding of virus from all secretions. Economic impact in terms of reduction in milk yield, loss of fetus due abortion, still-birth, mummification, and low body score, led various countries to start a control program to curtail and eradicate the disease from the livestock population. In order to control and prevent, prophylactic vaccination of susceptible animals and test and culling strategy depending upon seroprevalence of disease, cattle density, and trade has been adopted in European countries and results were quite convincing. The primary goal of prophylactic vaccination against BVDV is to protect the fetus from in-utero infection to avoid birth of new PI calves. Both MLV and inactivated vaccines are used for immunization of animals (Beer et al., 2000). It is considered that inactivated vaccine is safer than MLV and therefore MLV vaccine is not recommended to pregnant animals in their first 6 months. In contrast to NCP biotypes, most modern modified-live vaccines use CP biotypes of BVDV as these types of virus are not able to establish persistent infection in fetus. A Npro gene deleted and endoribonuclease activity inactivated NCP BVDV mutant was developed to deal with safety concerns which is not able to cross the placenta and provides immunity similar to field type BVDV. Marker vaccines based on glycoprotein E-2 expressed in baculovirus or transgenic plant and BVDV E-2 DNA vaccines have also been evaluated for immune response (Thomas et al., 2013). Recently, truncated glycoprotein E-2 fused with single chain antibody (APCH) subunit vaccine (Pecora et al., 2015) (Vedevax) expressed in baculovirus was commercialized for field use. Protective immune response in BVDV is genotype-specific and is not effective in conferring cross- protection to heterologous genotypes. Therefore vaccine formulations require either one or both genotypes depending upon the prevalence of BVDV in a particular continent or geographical strata. To address this aforementioned problem, a novel mosaic polypeptide chimeras having three protective determinants; of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b and BVDV-2 genotypes using adenovirus vector construct (adBVDV prototype vaccine) was evaluated and found better immunogenic with heterologous protection (Lokhandwala et al., 2017).",

Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1), a member of alphaherpesevirus is the etiological agent of IBR. This virus also causes infectious pustular vulvovaginitis in cows and infectious pustular balanoposthitis in bulls. Latency inside sensory ganglion is the most unique feature of BoHV-1 which is also seen in other herpes viral infections. Latent animals become clinically infected once again due to recrudescence of virus by stressful stimuli and subsequent reexcretion of infectious virus acts as a source of infection for other susceptible animals of the herd. It is a major economic problem in dairy and beef industries of the world due to huge production losses in the form of reduced milk yield, abortion, and less weight gain. The biosecurity, test and culling, and prophylactic immunization are used for control of the disease. Around 200 vaccines have been licensed for immunization against IBR worldwide. Among these most are conventional types (nonmarker) while very few are marker types. Conventional vaccines include either live or inactivated BoHV-1 strain while marker vaccines are gene deleted type mutants. Glycoprotein E, thymidine kinase (tk) gene or both, nonessential genes for virus replication, are targets of deletion from BoHV-1 virus and are well suited for DIVA. A double-gene deleted (gE\u2212 and tk\u2212) Bovine Herpes Virus type 1 vaccine is commercially available (van Engelenburg et al., 1994). These vaccines are effective in preventing clinical disease and reducing virus transmission but are not able to prevent infection from field virus. Most of the European countries have banned the use of conventional live vaccine and are strictly using marker vaccines for effective protection and serosurveillance with the aim of disease eradication. Majority of these vaccines are licensed for immunization of pregnant animals. Most of these vaccines are licensed for use in the United States or European countries and manufactured by Zoetis UK, MSD Animal Health and Laboratorios Hipra, Spain.\n",

            "text": "Influenza in domestic animals is caused by members of genus influenza virus A and most of have a zoonotic impact worldwide. Influenza virus A infects bird (both domestic and wild), pig, horse, dog, seal, whales, including human (Webster et al., 1992). Avian influenza, swine influenza, equine influenza, and canine influenza are the most common types of influenza virus A infection in birds, pigs, equines, and canines, respectively (Webster et al., 1992, Yoo et al., 2018). At present 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes have been recognized, while 2 additional HA and NA subtypes have been identified in bats and these subtypes can form thousands of antigenic combination (Gamblin and Skehel, 2010, Ciminski et al., 2017). Influenza virus A subtypes; H7N7and H3N8 cause respiratory disease in horses, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N8 cause influenza in swine, H3N8 and H3N2 cause respiratory implications in dogs (Yoo et al., 2018). Generally, all genetic combinations are reported from the domestic or wild bird that causes respiratory and systemic implication, but detection of H5 and H7 are prime importance due to their high virulence (Harfoot and Webby, 2017). In humans historically endemic H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and more recently sporadic or limited H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2 viruses caused respiratory diseases while H3N2 and H1N1 are currently circulating subtypes (Yoo et al., 2018). Avian influenza on the basis of the presence of single or several basic amino acids at the cleavage site in haemagglutinin are classified into low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus (Lee et al., 2004). Both types affect different avian species but wild and migratory birds act as a reservoir of LPAI. OIE has defined avian influenza as \u201can infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus with HPAI and by H5 and H7 subtypes with low pathogenicity (H5/H7 LPAI).\u201d Affected birds exhibit varying clinical manifestations from mild to severe respiratory, nervous, gastrointestinal, and reproductive system disease and sometimes birds are dead without any clinical appearance (Horby, 2014). Further, LPAI viruses also cause a considerable loss due to anorexia, respiratory signs, reduce egg production, and less weight gain. OIE recommended eradication of HPAI virus from poultry due to severe economic consequences in poultry industries in terms of reduced egg production, low quality of eggs, mortality, and evolution of new antigenic mutants via antigenic shift and drift posing a threat to humans. In addition to the controlled elimination of infected poultry, strict biosecurity, restriction on movement and purchase of birds, and good hygiene in the poultry farm, vaccination of birds is also followed. Currently inactivated mono and bivalent vaccines having H5 and H7 strains and live recombinant vaccines (fowlpox-H5) are available for immunization of poultry (Swayne, 2012). The reverse genetic-based recombinant H5N1 vaccine was also evaluated in mice and found to be a promising candidate vaccine against HPAI in poultry (Sedova et al., 2012, Lee and Song, 2013).",

The causative agent of this highly morbid disease is bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Saif, 1990). In addition to gastric infection, BCoV also affects the respiratory system of calves and feedlot cattle. The disease on sets is sudden and within a few days, most of the animals of the herd suffer from diarrhea. Milk production may not return to full capacity even after a long time of animal recovery or of that lactation. Due to rapid onset, high morbidity, and huge reduction in milk loss the disease is worrisome to dairy industries and farmers. For prevention of winter dysentery, there is no dedicated vaccine. However MLV coronavirus vaccine (BOVILIS Coronavirus, Intervet/Merck Animal Health) which is recommended for calves\u2019 diarrhea caused by bovine coronavirus. Further, a solubilized antigen from BCoV-infected cells combined with an oil adjuvant was tested as a prototype vaccine to be used against winter dysentery (Takamura et al., 2000, Takamura et al., 2002).",

It is one of the major concerns of neonatal diarrhea in domestic animals and mostly caused by group A RV (total 9 group A\u2013I). Bovine rotavirus (BRV) affects calves of 2\u20138 weeks of age and its susceptibility decreases as age progresses. Clinical manifestation in each species is similar ranging from asymptomatic subclinical condition to severe enteritis. Clinically calves suffer from acute, watery, dehydrating diarrhea and may succumb to infection. The morbidity and mortality are very high, leading to huge economical losses in dairy and beef industries worldwide. Mucosal immunity plays a major role to inhibit intestinal infections by any infectious pathogen and it is transferred from the dam to new young ones via colostrum feeding. Therefore if the pregnant dam is immunized with a rotavirus vaccine sufficiently, she can transfer antirotavirus maternal antibodies in surplus to protect calves sufficiently long duration. Both conventional and new generation vaccine such as subunit, DNA vaccine, VLP, plant-based edible vaccine (used VP-4, VP-6, or capsid protein), reverse genetic-based vaccine and recombinant BCG expressing VP-6 gene were evaluated to generate protective immunity (Poelaert et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2012). Commercially attenuated strains of BRV and coronavirus (Galf Guard, Zoetis, USA, PBS animal health, United States) are used to immunize calves and adult cattle. Inactivated BRV (serotypes G6 and G10) and coronavirus propagated on established cell lines and a K99 E. coli bacterin formulated with adjuvant (scourGuard, Zoetis, USA, MSD animal health) are used to immunize pregnant cattle and heifers. Further, some vaccines have Clostridium perfringens type C and type D toxoid, E. coli K99 along with inactivated bovine coronavirus type 1 and 3, inactivated BRV type G6 and G10 (Cooper).",

The disease is caused by Theileria species, most notably T. parva and T. annulata in cattle and T. lestoquardi in sheep. Transmission of T. parva and T. annulata are through Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks, occurs in eastern and southern Africa, and by Hyalomma ticks, occurs around the Mediterranean basin, north-east Africa, the Middle East, India, and southern Asia, respectively. African buffalo and Asian buffalo are also susceptible to T. parva and T. annulata, respectively. Theileria species cause acute lymphoproliferative disease with a high level of morbidity and mortality and economic losses (Sivakumar et al., 2014). For control of the disease, acaricides and buparvaquone (therapeutic compound) are used but due to regular use of acaricides and the high cost of buparvaquone, the overall control and treatment are very expensive. Besides, drug resistant T. annulata is also reported recently. Vaccination is the only sustainable alternative of these limitations (Nene and Morrison, 2016). Immunization with T. parva and T. annulata infected cell line as live vaccines were attempted but found to be noneconomical. A live vaccine having infectious sporozoites was developed. Because of limitations in live vaccines, other alternatives were searched to develop subunit and viral-vectored vaccines based on the use of defined antigens of sporozoite (Knight et al., 1996) and schizont (Goh et al., 2016) developmental stages. But at present only live vaccines against both T. parva and T. annulata based on sporozoites are used to immunize the animals.",

Among them, Eimeria tenella is the most pathogenic one and can develop resistance rapidly against anticoccidial drugs. For control of coccidia in poultry farm, prophylactic use of anticoccidial drugs were followed since long and still are the preferred method. But the problem is the quick development of resistance against available anticoccidial drugs and requirement of new drugs. In addition to chemotherapy, vaccination is also used to protect chickens (Tewari and Maharana, 2011). Most commonly used vaccines for immunization of chickens are live oocysts either from attenuated or nonattenuated strains of coccidian (Chapman and Jeffers, 2014). Nonattenuated live vaccines have variable numbers of wild coccidian strains depending upon their use in broiler breeders (up to eight strains, Coccivac-D, and Immucox-C2), or broiler industries (up to four strains Coccivac-B, Immucox-C1) but the main risk is development of severe reaction in vaccinated poultry. The live-attenuated oocysts vaccine strains (Paracox and HatchPak CocciIII) have fewer vaccines-induced risks (Price, 2012). Indigenous live-attenuated quadrivalent coccidia vaccine having Eimeria tenella, E. acervulina, E. maxima, and E. necatrix (LivacoxQ, Hester) is available in India. DNA recombinant technology was also used to develop a recombinant vaccine based on an immunodominant portion of proteins of various stages either of sporozoites or merozoites or gametes of Eimeria species (Tewari and Maharana, 2011). At present only one commercialized subunit vaccine is available for coccidiosis (CoxAbic) based on purified native protein extracted from gametocytes of Eimeria.",

Chickens are reared mainly for broiler (meat) and layer (eggs) purposes. Along with nutritional and housing management, good health is of paramount importance to achieve better growth rates in broilers and to get good quality eggs from layers throughout year. Poultry are susceptible to many infectious diseases such as infectious bursal disease, infectious bronchitis, infectious laryngotracheitis, Marek\u2019s disease, Newcastle disease, Fowl pox, avian influenza, fowl cholera, fowl typhoid, bacillary white diarrhea, chronic respiratory disease, and coccidiosis, etc. (Deshmukh et al., 2015, Jordan, 2017, Garc\u00eda, 2017, Yuan et al., 2018, Alkie and Rautenschlein, 2016, Wua et al., 2011, Reddy et al., 2016). Morbidity and mortality caused by the pathogens are very high leading to negative impact on production and human welfare due to shortage of food supply. These diseases could be controlled by immunization of poultry flocks with negligible expense on each bird. For immunization of poultry conventional (inactivated and live) and biotechnological or genetic engineering (subunit, vectored, DNA, and VLP) tools have been employed to develop effective vaccines. But, availability of recombinant (biotechnological based) vaccines for field use are very limited as most of them are in different phases of clinical trials or have some quality control issues. At present either inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines are being used for mass immunization of poultry flocks. The susceptibility toward different diseases depends on the age of birds. Therefore two types of vaccination schedule are recommended for poultry flocks, namely for boilers and layers (Table 20.3\n).\n",
