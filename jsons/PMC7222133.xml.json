Hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) is diagnosed based on physical examination and clinical findings, but the most accurate method is echocardiography [1]. Currently, the first choice of treatment for hsPDA is with medications, primarily indomethacin and ibuprofen [2]. Paracetamol is an effective alternative, with less side effects [2\u20135]. Surgical ligation is the next line of treatment [6].",

Doppler sampling of LM velocities was performed via short axis view at the level of the aortic valve or apical 5-chamber view.

The ratio of left atrial to aortic root dimensions was calculated to assess PDA significance. Ductal size was also adjusted for weight [19]. Coronary flow was evaluated during diastole as the majority of coronary arterial flow occurs then. Measurements were averaged from three consecutive beats. The peak diastolic velocity (Vd) represents the flow velocity in the vessel and was measured in cm/s. Flow is represented by both the diastolic time-velocity integral (TVId) and flow index (FI). TVId is the area under the velocity/time curve and was measured in centimeter. FI is the coronary flow volume index per minute and was calculated as the product of TVId times the heart rate, measured in cm/min. FI was also adjusted for birth weight [10, 12]. Flow was calculated by multiplying the FI by \u03c0 x coronary artery radius2. Cardiac output index (COI) (cm/min) was measured as systolic time- velocity integral measured in the left ventricular outlet times the heart rate, and was also adjusted for weight [19]. Cardiac output was calculated by multiplying the COI by \u03c0 \u00d7 left ventricle outlet radius2. Myocardial oxygen demand was calculated as heart rate times the systolic blood pressure, and was also adjusted for weight [20]. Measurements of peak Vd and TVId were performed with the internal analysis package of the ultrasound unit. Values for all parameters were obtained by averaging measurements of three consecutive cardiac cycles. All images were analyzed offline. Our results address the LM coronary artery and not the LAD, because the latter is a continuation of the LM coronary artery and was inaccessible in most premature infants in the study.",

Furthermore, even in the patients with ductal closure, the closure was not complete. As suggested by Van Laere et al. PDA diameter/BW higher than 1.4 mm/kg is an important measure of large ductal shunt [19]. In our study group after treatment, the PDA diameter/BW ratio was 1.9 mm/kg, suggesting only partial duct closure. Thus, insufficient closure of the PDA could also contribute to no effect on coronary flow.

On the one hand, LA/aortic root ratio above 1.5 is considered indicative of hsPDA, and our result was 1.3, with statistical difference only when compared with the group with no PDA. But on the other hand, PDA diameter and flow velocity met the definitions of hsPDA, and PDA diameter/weight was above 1.4, which is considered a better measure of ductal shunt in previous studies [19, 22]. In addition, there were clinical and laboratory measures showing that the study group did have a hemodynamic clinically significant PDA. While the severity of their clinical condition and outcome could result from their more extreme prematurity, we did perform a multivariate analysis showing the clinical outcomes to be related not only to GA, but also to the size of the PDA. Ductal size was independently associated with length of mechanical ventilation, nasal and O2 support and length of stay. These findings are in accordance with worse clinical outcomes in premature infants who have significant PDA described in the literature [1].",

            "text": "Furthermore, the troponin values were significantly higher in the study group compared with the comparison groups. In our study, we used the cardiac troponin T test since this test is considered a specific marker for myocardial ischemic injury, unlike other markers like troponin I and creatinine kinase [23]. The study group population was younger and with more comorbidities, which may raise concern for a confounding effect. For example, higher troponin values could be related to ischemic effects of respiratory distress syndrome [24, 25]. Hence, a multivariate analysis was performed and demonstrated troponin to be related significantly and independently to gestational age and ductus size. These findings may indicate that the PDA in our group was hemodynamically significant causing myocardial strain. It may also suggest that troponin was more or as sensitive as our echocardiography findings to the ductal effect on coronary flows. A previous study by El-Khuffash et al. found that PDA and large ductal size had significant correlations to higher troponin levels [23], similar to our study results. They demonstrated normalization of troponin post treatment. An additional study evaluating the relation between PDA and troponin was conducted by Asrani et al. with similar conclusions [26]. The cumulative data might suggest that troponin level could be helpful in the assessment of clinically significant PDA. No follow up of troponin levels after ductal treatment or electrocardiography exams to demonstrate ST-segment depression [27] were made in our study due to technical difficulties. Future larger studies with troponin measurements before and after PDA closure could help strengthen the predictability of this marker, and may allow to set a threshold clinical level for hsPDA. To do that, more information regarding troponin levels in other conditions like placental insufficiency [28], ashyxia [29] and respiratory distress syndrome [24, 25] is needed, because the current knowledge is limited.",

Because the coronary arteries in premature infants are small in diameter and may undergo significant changes that could not be accurately measured during the echocardiography [14] the use of this tool may be misleading and operator dependent. Furthermore, small changes could dramatically affect the assessment of the flow. When we used FI as approximation for flow instead of calculating coronary flow taking into consideration the coronary diameter, we came to opposite results, showing an increase in FI with hsPDA (Table 3). To assure that our results were accurate we performed an ICC analysis, that found that both the FI and the coronary flow measured by our senior cardiologist had good accuracy (0.77 and 0.78, respectively). Thus, taking into account the surface area of the LM coronary artery to assess flows, affected our results and interpretation of the data. In our study, a single senior cardiologist who has the expertise and the experience in evaluating coronary flow conducted all the measurements, reducing the possibility of human measurement error. Yet, we raise a concern that this tool might not be accurate in unexperienced hands.",

The consideration for echocardiography testing was clinical and we did not interfere with the department\u2019s routine. Another limitation of our study is the different treatment protocols used during the study that could influence the results.
