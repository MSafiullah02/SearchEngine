Secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta strands will start to form as soon as amino acids are strung into a chain. It is not known whether the ribosome channel and the Sec61 translocon allow any conformational changes, but the folding of growing nascent chains in the ER lumen has been well\u2010documented [7, 8]. N\u2010linked glycan chains are added to asparagine residues in consensus glycosylation sequences some 12\u201314 residues from the ER membrane\n[9], and disulfide bond formation starts early as well. During the folding process, native as well as non\u2010native disulfide bonds may form, a process that is catalyzed by disulfide isomerases in the ER. The unscrambling of wrong cysteine bridges into native ones is assisted by the same enzymes. Competition between disulfide bond formation and glycosylation\n[10] suggests that folding may start in the translocon. A viral example is the Newcastle disease virus HN protein, in which deletion of cysteines number 13 or 14 allows the use of one additional neighboring glycosylation site\n[11].",

The process may take from minutes to days to complete, and during this time the newly synthesized protein is retained in the ER. Purified proteins can fold into the correct conformation in isolation, since the three\u2010dimensional structure is solely determined by the primary amino acid sequence. Correct in vitro folding usually requires low protein concentrations and low temperatures. The crowdedness in the ER at physiological temperatures makes folding assistance invaluable. Folding enzymes such as disulfide isomerases and prolyl\u2010peptidyl cis\u2010trans isomerases catalyze covalent changes that may be rate\u2010limiting to folding. In addition, a large number of molecules act by preventing undesirable interactions between the newly synthesized immature proteins. They are suitably called molecular chaperones\n[12].",

The ER folding factors may thus constitute the quality control system of the organelle as well. Up to now, the lectin chaperones are the only ones for which this connection is firmly established\n[13]. Calnexin and calreticulin themselves serve as retention factors; they do not control the quality of the product they bind. Quality is checked by the enzyme UDP\u2010glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which adds a single glucose to the mannose chain, provided some hydrophobic residues are exposed on the protein in addition to the innermost GlcNAc residue of the glycan\n[14]. Reglucosylation results in renewed binding to calnexin and calreticulin, which is preceded and followed by glucosidase II\u2010mediated deglucosylation. Alternating glucosidase II and glucosyltransferase activities establish a cycle of binding and release to the lectin chaperones, during which the substrate folds and is checked for structural quality\n[15]. All proteins with glycan chains that have been examined so far interact with at least one of the lectin chaperones. This suggests that in the choice of a newly synthesized protein for a particular chaperone, the affinity of the lectins for the glycan chain is dominant.",

One difference that emerges is the more extensive glycosylation most viral glycoproteins undergo. This could serve to protect the virus and cover potentially immunogenic epitopes. Glycosylation sites are easily added or deleted during viral evolution and the diversity of glycan modifications, which depends on the location of the site in the protein and on the cell type, adds complexity to these structures\n[17].",

In an in vitro binding assay, however, calreticulin can associate with VSV G\n[15], suggesting that the membrane attachment of calnexin determine the preference of VSV G in the intact ER. Deletion of one of the two carbohydrate chains on VSV G protein still allows an interaction with calnexin, albeit inefficient\n[19]. The single glycan on SFV E1 protein is different: it allows an interaction with either calnexin or calreticulin\n[20]. Proteins that are more heavily glycosylated, such as influenza A virus HA\n[21] and HIV\u20101 envelope glycoprotein\n[22], associate with both chaperones. The lectins can bind simultaneously to one folding HA molecule, showing specificity for particular glycans\n[21]. Of the two glycans in the hepatitis B virus M protein, only one was shown to bind calnexin\n[23].

This implies that Erp57 and PDI assist native disulfide bond formation during folding of E1 and p62, seconded by the lectin chaperones. Aside from the lectins, newly synthesized viral glycoproteins may bind BiP and other folding factors. The sequence and timing with which they associate and the particular chaperone that is used first, depend on the substrate molecule that is folding. Whereas HA binds to both lectin chaperones, and only associates with BiP if this first\u2010choice binding is prevented\n[25], VSV G protein associates with calnexin but not calreticulin and requires transfer to BiP to complete folding\n[18].

In the same cells, general protein maturation in the ER is not affected. Rudd and Dwek\n[17] suggest that the specificity for viral proteins is due to the icosahedral structure of the affected viruses. A small conformational change in one molecule may not be tolerated in the stringent lattice of the virus particle. In favor of this argument is the lack of effect of glucosidase inhibitors on the Newcastle disease virus, which does not have a strict symmetric particle structure\n[1]. The folding rate of its HN protein, which normally binds calnexin, is decreased by a factor two in the presence of glucosidase inhibitors, but the protein still passes the ER quality control, reaches the cell surface, and has biological activity\n[28].",

In addition, the conformation needs to be such that not only oligomeric interactions between polypeptide chains arise, but also that larger complexes can be formed.

            "text": "A second feature that distinguishes viral from cellular proteins is the complex evolutionary history of viral proteins. Viruses evolve much more rapidly than their hosts do, and recombination events are frequent. As a consequence, protein modules from different viruses may combine into one multifunctional protein. This is a survival strategy of many RNA viruses, because of their small genome. One or two glycoproteins on the viral envelope then need to perform all the essential functions of the virus. A beautiful example is the influenza C virus spike protein HEF [3]. It consists of three domains, each having its own biological activity. It combines a receptor\u2010binding domain R, an esterase domain E, and a fusion domain F. Domain R is placed in a loop of domain E and domain E is placed in a loop of domain F. Domains R and F have close structural similarity to the HA protein of influenza A virus. The only difference is the lack of E in influenza A; the receptor\u2010binding domain is inserted directly into a loop of the fusion domain (\nFig. 2). In each domain as well as in the complete proteins, the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini are adjacent. The domains basically form loops, sometimes stabilized by a disulfide bond between the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminus\n[31]. Examination of crystal structures of other viral glycoproteins, e.g. of retroviruses, raises the suggestion that this may be a more general phenomenon. The core of the soluble receptor\u2010binding subunit gp120 of HIV envelope has adjacent N\u2010 and C\u2010termini; the envelope protein of a mouse retrovirus was shown to tolerate large insertions and deletions in its hypervariable domain\n[32]; the same was seen in a variant of a pseudorabies virus glycoprotein\n[33].",

Two of the three domains in influenza C virus HEF are composed of interrupted portions of the polypeptide chain. To fold properly, these chains need to combine during the folding process. Influenza A HA starts to fold co\u2010translationally and the first domain to fold is the top domain [8, 34]. This is the receptor\u2010binding domain, similar to R in influenza C, and the only domain consisting of one continuous polypeptide chain. The stem domain, comparable with fusion domain F in influenza C, folds next, after the folding of the top domain is complete\n[8, 34]. The polypeptide chain of influenza A HA forms a loop, and folding starts at the tip of the loop.

Chaperone binding might be more important for this type of protein than for proteins with sequential domains formed from N\u2010 to C\u2010terminus. Disulfide bond formation in the loop structures may involve transient non\u2010native disulfide cross\u2010links that need to be unscrambled by PDI and its family members. Up to now, however, there is no evidence for a different requirement for folding factors or for a difference in the number of non\u2010native disulfide bridges during folding. This could be due to a shortage of available information, but it is more likely that there is no difference at all, because the folding process of virtually all proteins studied so far occurs mostly post\u2010translationally.

For HIV envelope, signal sequence cleavage was shown to occur late\n[36], i.e. long after synthesis was completed, instead of co\u2010translationally, as seen for all other proteins examined so far. Based on the structure of influenza A HA, Wilson et al.\n[5] proposed in 1981 that signal sequence removal would be late in HA. We still do not know when it occurs, except that it is a co\u2010translational process.

The best studied fusion protein is the influenza A virus HA [31, 37], which shows many similarities with other viral fusion proteins\n[38, 39, 40, 41]. A common theme is the immense irreversible conformational change fusion proteins undergo during the fusion process, sometimes even involving disulfide bond isomerization\n[53]. The fusion protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein. It folds in the ER into a stable conformation and oligomerizes; influenza virus and retrovirus spikes assemble into a homotrimer. At some point before or after incorporation of the protein into the virion, the fusion protein is activated by a proteolytic cleavage which results in a homotrimer of subunits consisting of a disulfide\u2010linked (influenza A HA) or noncovalently associated (HIV Env) dimer. The conformation of the cleaved protein is metastable: the protein has fusogenic activity. Consequently, receptor\u2010binding (such as for HIV) or a change in pH after entry into endosomes (such as for influenza virus), triggers a conformational change that brings the viral and cellular membranes close enough to fuse. This post\u2010fusion structure cannot be reversed anymore, and was shown to be more stable than the pre\u2010fusion structure [\nFig. 1, see\n[31]].",

The question is whether this immense conformational change means that these proteins fold in a different manner than proteins that remain stable after folding. The cleaved precursor protein is metastable, and the conformational change is irreversible, because the new conformation has a lower free energy. Irrespective, the protein that folds in the ER is the uncleaved precursor, essentially a different protein. Ingenious as the fusion machines that have evolved may be, it does not exclude their precursors from the ordinary treatment they receive in the ER (\nFig. 1).",

In addition, some specific proteins are known that play a role in the folding of one particular protein or family of proteins [13]. To pass the ER quality control system, oligomers usually need to be assembled, although often one of the subunits can escape without association\n[13, 44]. Rare for cellular proteins, but quite common among viral glycoproteins, is the need for co\u2010translational assembly to reach a proper structure. Relatively well\u2010characterized examples are the envelope proteins from hepatitis C virus and the alphaviruses Sindbis and SFV. The alphaviruses present the genes encoding for the structural proteins on a 26S subgenomic mRNA\n[43]. This is translated as a precursor polyprotein in which the proteins are separated by co\u2010translational cleavage events. The cytosolic capsid protein folds, cleaves itself off, and the following set of proteins is translocated into the ER lumen and forms the envelope spike [see\n[20]]. Essentially, two structural proteins are synthesized next, in addition to one small 6K protein, which has not yet been very well characterized. The p62 and E1 protein of SFV are similar to the pE2 and E1 protein of Sindbis virus. E1 and p62 form a heterodimer. Cleavage of p62 into E2 and E3 in the TGN renders the spike protein fusogenic.

SFV p62 and E1, when expressed from separate mRNAs, display different behavior: p62 folds normally but E1 misfolds and accumulates in aggregates\n[45]. This implies that E1 needs to associate co\u2010translationally with p62 for productive folding. For Sindbis E1 and pE2, the group of Brown\n[46, 47, 48] carried out extensive folding studies. The E1 protein proceeds through three differentially disulfide\u2010linked folding intermediates E1\u03b1, E1\u03b2 and E1\u0393 before it reaches the native state E1\u025b. Two other species are detected, but these seem to be unrelated to the correct folding pathway. Folding of E1 beyond E1\u03b2 depends on dimerization with pE2\n[46]. E1 associates transiently with BiP, until pE2 takes over. The assembly of E1 with pE2 and its release from BiP coincide with the acquisition of a conformation that is compact enough to be resistant to reduction by DTT, indicative of an important maturation step. pE2, on the other hand, is only found in a complex with BiP when it is misfolded\n[48]. Neither calnexin nor grp94 have been found to co\u2010immunoprecipitate with the Sindbis glycoproteins. This may be a technical issue, because SFV p62 and E1 both associate with calnexin and calreticulin as well as the disulfide isomerases PDI and Erp57\n[20]. Although p62 can fold quite well when expressed from a different mRNA than E1, its \u2018homologue\u2019 in Sindbis virus, pE2, does aggregate when a misfolded E1 is co\u2010expressed\n[47].

            "text": "A picture emerges that viral proteins, as with cellular proteins, have their own specific requirements during the folding process. Preference for particular chaperones cannot easily be predicted. In most cases, the absence of a detectable association is likely to have a technical rather than a physiological reason. What makes viral envelope proteins special is the intricate network of functions and associations of which they are part of: the activation of precursor proteins into metastable structures, the changing interactions during cell attachment and cell entry, the tight regulation of subunit synthesis, making proteins dependent on each other for folding. Moreover, in contrast to cellular proteins, a higher yield of folded viral protein may not always be favorable for the virus, because viral replication and virus production require a relatively healthy host cell for prolonged periods of time. It is clear that more studies on viral envelope glycoproteins are needed to determine whether folding in the ER can be a target for antiviral strategies.",
