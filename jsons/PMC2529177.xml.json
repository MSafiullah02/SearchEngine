Chronic HCV infection frequently results in serious liver disease, including steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. In the United States, hepatitis C is a leading cause for orthotopic liver transplantation. Unfortunately, liver transplantation is not a cure for hepatitis C. Viral recurrence is an invariable problem and a leading cause of graft loss [2]. A vaccine protecting against HCV infection is not available, and current antiviral therapies are characterized by limited efficacy, high cost, and substantial side effects [3].",

Translation of the major open reading frame of the HCV genome results in the production of an approximately 3000 amino acid long polyprotein, which is cleaved co- and post-translationally by the coordinated action of cellular and two viral proteases into its functional subunits Core (C), envelopes 1 and 2 (E1 and E2), p7 and non-structural proteins (NS) 2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [4]. HCV replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell, which is primarily the hepatocyte. Until recently, due to the lack of a cell culture system, HCV could not be efficiently propagated in cultured cells to support molecular studies of the virus\u2013host interaction [5]. Robust production of infectious HCV in cell culture has finally been achieved using a unique HCV genome derived from the blood of a Japanese patient with fulminant hepatitis C (JFH-1) [6], [7], [8]. Moreover, virus particles generated from the JFH-1 clone turned out to be infectious in vivo both in chimpanzees and in mice containing human liver xenografts [6], [9]. By introducing multiple adaptive mutations or using DNA expression construct, infectious HCV genotype 1 could also be produced in cell culture [10], [11].",

These studies have greatly contributed to our current understanding of HCV infection, including immunity and pathogenesis (for review see [12]). However, the chimpanzee model has some important limitations. HCV-infected chimpanzees rarely develop chronic liver disease to the extent seen in HCV-infected humans [13], making the chimpanzee a less than ideal model for studying the mechanisms of HCV pathogenesis. Moreover, chimpanzees are expensive and difficult to handle, and must be housed and cared for in appropriate non-human primate research facilities. Since 1988 the chimpanzee has been listed as an endangered species [14]. These limitations of the chimpanzee model have stimulated progress toward developing alternative animal models for HCV research.",

            "text": "Several groups have established transgenic mice expressing HCV proteins either individually or together as a polyprotein to study the effect of these proteins on liver pathology. Hepatic steatosis is a common histological feature of chronic hepatitis C. Steatosis is more frequent and severe in patients infected with HCV genotype 3 [18]. The mechanisms underlying this genotype specific steatosis are unknown. However, hepatic steatosis can develop secondary to obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, protein malnutrition, total parenteral nutrition, acute starvation and drug therapy [19]. A number of transgenic mouse model studies indicate that the HCV core protein is sufficient to induce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (for review see [20]). The core protein is an RNA-binding protein that is a component of the viral nucleocapsid [21]. In infected cells the core protein was found to associate with lipid droplets [22]. Recent studies suggest that the association of core protein with lipid droplets plays an important role in HCV morphogenesis and efficient virus production [23], [24]. Based on the experimental model of the transgenic mouse, the HCV core protein seems to inhibit the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity [25]. As this is the rate limiting enzyme of hepatic lipoprotein assembly, the direct and likely consequence of its inactivation is accumulation of unsecreted triglycerides, hence steatosis. Moreover, HCV core protein expression in the mouse liver upregulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) promoter activity [26]. SREBP-1c is a transcription factor leading to the upregulation of enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis, an event that can favor intracellular accumulation of triglycerides [27].",

HCC usually arises after 2\u20134 decades of infection, typically in the context of an underlying cirrhosis [28]. Through the use of transgenic mouse models, it has also become evident that the core protein of HCV has an oncogenic activity in the liver. HCV core protein constitutively expressed in the liver of C57BL/6 mice \u2013 a strain which is known to exhibit spontaneous occurrence of HCC only rarely \u2013 at levels similar to that found in chronic hepatitis C patients lead to multicentric hepatic adenomas, and developed HCCs in an age-dependent manner [29], [30], [31], [32]. HCC was observed predominantly in males, an observation consistent with the epidemiological data that men chronically infected with HCV are more likely to develop HCC [33]. Transgenic mice expressing the complete HCV polyprotein showed an increased risk of cancer [32] suggesting that other HCV proteins might also play a role in the development of hepatocarcinogenesis. In a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-based model of hepatocarcinogenesis, transgenic mice expressing core, E1 and E2 structural proteins demonstrated an accelerated tumor growth phenotype suggesting that HCV E1 and/or E2, possibly in conjunction with core protein, can act as tumor enhancer proteins [34]. However, other groups reported transgenic mice expressing the HCV core, E1 and E2 protein did not exhibit any pathological phenotype of the liver [35], [36]. These differences may be related to the expression level of the transgene or different genetic background on which the transgenic models were produced. To address the role of HCV non-structural proteins in liver pathology, transgenic mice expressing HCV NS3, NS4 or NS5A protein were generated. By contrast, expression of HCV non-structural proteins did not cause any spontaneous liver pathology [37], [38], [39].",

RXR\u03b1 is abundantly expressed in the liver and plays important roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation as well as in lipid metabolism [47]. Furthermore, proteasome activator PA28\u03b3 has been identified as an HCV core binding protein in the livers of both HCV core-transgenic mice and a patient with chronic hepatitis C [48]. Interestingly, knockout of the PA28\u03b3 gene from PA28\u03b3+/+/HCV core-transgenic mice disrupted the development of both steatosis and HCC [26] suggesting that PA28\u03b3 activity may play a crucial role in the development of liver pathology induced by HCV infection. Finally, HCV core-transgenic mice demonstrated an activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) [49]. Subsequent studies showed that PPAR\u03b1 is essential for HCV core protein-induced hepatic steatosis and HCC in mice [50]. PPAR\u03b1 regulates the transcription of genes encoding fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes and various cell-cycle regulators and oncogene products such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc are known to be induced in a PPAR\u03b1-dependent manner [51].

            "text": "Consistent with the constitutive expression of HCV proteins, conventional transgenic mice are immunotolerant to these proteins. Thus, one desired goal of transgene technology is temporal control of target gene expression in the specific organ. The Cre\u2013loxP recombination system is a useful method of conditional gene expression that allows spatial (cell-type specific) and temporal (inducer-dependent) control. The Cre\u2013loxP system has two components: Cre recombinase and two lox P sites that Cre recognizes. The site-specific recombination is accomplished by Cre-mediated catalysis of reciprocal recombination between the two lox P sites in both tissue-culture cells and mice [60]. Using the Cre\u2013loxP-mediated conditional expression system Wakita and colleagues [61] generated HCV transgenic mice, which express HCV core, E1, E2 and NS2 protein. HCV transgene expression in the liver was induced by intravenous administration of a recombinant adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase [61]. HCV transgenic mice regulated by the Cre\u2013loxP switching system demonstrated an anti-core antibody response and an HCV-specific T cell response after induction of the core transgene expression [61], [62]. Most interestingly, this immune response resulted in hepatitis [61], [62]. Furthermore, Machida and colleagues [63] used the Cre\u2013loxP system to study the effect of HCV proteins on Fas-mediated cell death. Interestingly, transgene expression of HCV transgene mice suppressed Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death suggesting that HCV can evade the innate antiviral mechanism of apoptosis to maintain persistent infection. The Cre\u2013loxP switching system provides a useful \u201cnon-immune tolerant\u201d HCV transgene mouse model which allows the study of the host immune response against the HCV proteins. A non-adenoviral gene delivery method for Cre recombinase in future Cre\u2013loxP HCV mouse models may further strengthen the application of this technology for the study of HCV\u2013host interactions by eliminating adenovirus-related effects. A potential strategy could be the production of HCV transgenic mice in which the Cre\u2013loxP switching gene expression system is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible expression system [64].",

Furthermore, recent studies indicate that this model allows the study of antiviral activities of drugs and neutralizing antibodies in vivo. The successful application of the SCID/Alb-uPA mouse model for drug development has been shown by two recent publications investigating the efficacy of interferon alpha2b (IFN-\u03b1) and HCV NS3 protease inhibitor (BILN2061). Treatment with both IFN-\u03b1 and BILN2061 appeared to produce similar antiviral effect in HCV infection in either humans or this mouse model [69], [70]. For example, after 4 days of therapy with BILN2061, HCV titers decreased by approximately 2 log, similar to the impact seen in clinical trials [69], [70]. These findings indicate that the SCID/Alb-uPA mouse can model the HCV antiviral treatment response in humans with reasonable accuracy and may represent a valuable tool for the study of in vivo drug metabolism during pre-clinical evaluation of candidate therapeutics. In addition, the SCID/Alb-uPA mouse may be a useful animal model to evaluate the pre-clinical toxicity of new antiviral compounds against HCV as shown by the manifestation of the well-characterized clinical and ultrastructural signs of cardiotoxicity in SCID/Alb-uPA mice induced by the antiviral BILN 2061 [70].",

Their results provide evidence that broadly neutralizing antibodies to HCV protect against heterologous viral infection and suggest that a prophylactic vaccine against HCV may be achievable [71], [72]. Vanwolleghem and colleagues also addressed the question whether IgG with neutralizing properties from chronically infected patients can prevent de novo HCV infection in vivo.

Transcriptional profiling of HCV-induced gene expression changes in the SCID/Alb-uPA mouse model demonstrated that animals containing hepatocytes from the same donor showed a more similar response, than animals containing hepatocytes from different donors [74]. For example, all HCV-infected animals showed activation of the host innate antiviral signaling pathways, but the response was highly variable in the number and intensity of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes indicating that host factors may influence the effectiveness of the innate immune response [74].",

Transgenic mice expressing HCV proteins have been shown to play an important role in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of HCV\u2013host interaction and HCV-related liver pathology. Since steatosis and HCC are relevant clinical manifestations seen in HCV-infected individuals [18], transgenic mouse models more metabolically similar to human are needed. First, unlike in humans, mouse\u2019s primary circulating lipoprotein is HDL. Second, whereas human liver produces only apoB100, mouse liver produce both apoB100 and its truncated form, apoB48. Also, CETP, a plasma glycoprotein that facilitates transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL and LDL, is present in humans but not in mice (for review see [77]). Developing HCV transgenic mice with more human-like lipid metabolism may help to better understand the impact of viral proteins in the pathogenesis of liver disease as well as the development and characterization of antivirals.",

Host cell surface receptors are recognized as important determinants of virus\u2013host range and tissue tropism [78]. The HCV-receptor interaction is a multistep process itself and the virus uses several binding and entry receptors simultaneously or sequentially to enter the host cell (for review see [5]). It is of interest to note that although HCV cannot infect mouse hepatocytes, replication of the HCV prototype JFH-1 strain in mouse hepatoma cell lines has been reported [79]. One future strategy to overcome species barriers in studying HCV infection would be to establish a transgenic mouse line expressing human HCV-receptor molecules. In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection, the development of a transgenic mouse line expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) has been demonstrated to be a suitable model to study SARS infection in mice [80]. The tetraspanin CD81 has been proposed to play a role in HCV entry (for review see [5]). However, transgenic mice expressing human CD81 in the liver did not confer susceptibility to HCV infection [81] suggesting that human CD81 is not the only cellular factor required for HCV infection in the mouse. Thus, the development of a permissive HCV mouse model may require the co-expression of several human HCV entry molecules (such as human liver specific heparan sulfate [82], [83] and scavenger receptor class B type I [84], and claudin [85] as well as other not yet identified host factors restricting HCV tropism to the human hepatocyte.",
