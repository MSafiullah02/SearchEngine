Global health negotiations often invoke shared values and goals, though interpretation and interests may differ. As Fisher et al.

Where values are shared, stakeholders are more likely to seek, as a minimum, to accommodate the speci fi c interpretations and interests of each party. More constructively they may collaborate to fi nd new solutions to mutually recognized problems. Where values are not shared, stakeholders are more likely, either to avoid the issues or to seek to develop a position of advantage to advance one interest over another.

An international group of 39 pharmaceutical companies challenged the legality of the act in the Pretoria High Court. This challenge might have succeeded, but for the intervention of a local civil society group called the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) who alerted the international network of civil society groups in this fi eld and won the right to present their case in court. Protests grew around the world and in the face of this the pharmaceutical fi rms withdrew their challenge.

While a revision process commenced, progress proved glacial due to the lack of interest and support by key member states. It was not until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003-2004 that suf fi cient political priority was forthcoming. This led to concerted efforts, under the auspices of an Intergovernmental Working Group on the Revision of the International Health Regulations, which reached agreement on the revised IHR (2005) which countries have adopted. factors such as the emergence of research evidence, the response to a crisis or simply as a result of ongoing international discussions.",

Issues may also be raised by civil society groups or as a result of negotiations in spheres not previously associated with health such as the World Trade Organisation. But it is not a simple matter to introduce a new issue to the crowded agenda of global health diplomacy. Moreover the way in which an issue is framed, how it is identi fi ed and the policy context in which it is viewed is crucial to subsequent global health negotiations. As Labont\u00e9 and Gagnon ( 2010 ) note, global health issues arise in many different policy frames : security, development, global public goods, human rights, trade and ethical/moral reasoning. This question has still not been fully resolved as the declaration was only \u2022 implemented in 2003 by the WTO General Council as a temporary waiver of TRIPS rules. As a consequence negotiations on the application of paragraphs 4-6 of the Doha Declaration that permit the compulsory licensing of drugs (circumventing patent rights) in response to threats to public health considered to be a national emergency or other circumstance of extreme urgency must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis in the light of local conditions (see Box 5).",

This was accepted at the WHA meeting of 2000. An International Negotiating Board (INB) was formed which negotiated the wording of the convention over two years. In 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was adopted by the WHA, the convention came into effect in 2005 after 40-member states had signed, often following internal dialogue.

Brazil was the second country to introduce graphic warnings on cigarette packs, it has a history of awareness raising and controls on tobacco stretching back to 1990. Its programme of public engagement and working with civil society organizations to reduce smoking rates is regarded as exemplary and perhaps for this reason and because of the growing importance of emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in international fora-and as target markets for tobacco companies, Brazil was invited to chair the INB.

The WHO may be required to examine the performance of states and raise questions about the extent of their observance of global treaties. International agreements thus help to de fi ne the roles and regimes of agencies like WHO in global governance. And as the role and functions of international agencies evolves this will in turn in fl uence the way international agreements are applied. Thus global health negotiation can be seen as a mechanism that drives the ongoing evolution of global governance for health as an open system responding to its geopolitical context. Since global health treaties and agreements often also imply a moral obligation, there is a further \"court\" at which disputes can be raised, which is the court of public opinion.

The United Nations Millennium Declaration which led to the agreement of \u2022 189 countries to the MDGs framed HIV/AIDS as a development challenge. The Declaration of the UN General Assembly Special Session of 2001 can \u2022 be seen as framing the HIV/AIDS crisis in terms of global public goods and the need for joint action and funding. In 2006 Member States of the UN adopted a Political Declaration on moves \u2022 towards ensuring universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment that frames this issue in terms of human rights. The WTO Ministerial Conference in 2001 proposed the Doha Declaration \u2022 on the TRIPS and Public Health, which balanced trade considerations with ethical/moral reasoning with respect to HIV/AIDS and other global health issues.",
