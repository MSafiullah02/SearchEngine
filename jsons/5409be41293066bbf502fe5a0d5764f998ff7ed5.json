This chapter is primarily focused on the population level, which includes informatics applied to public health and to the entire health care system (health information infrastructure). Population-level informatics has its own special problems, issues, and considerations. Creating information systems at the population level has always been very difficult because of the large number of data elements and individuals that must be included, as well as the need to address data and information issues that affect health in the aggregate (e.g., environmental determinants of health). With faster and cheaper hardware and radically improved software tools, it has become financially and technically feasible to create information systems that will provide the information about individuals and populations necessary for optimized decision-making in medical care and public health. However, much work remains to fully achieve this goal.",

However, it should be emphasized that the domain of public health informatics is not limited to the medical care environment. For example, information technology is being applied to automatically detect threats to health from the food supply, water systems, and even driving conditions (such as obstacles on the roadway beyond the reach of visible headlight beams), and to assist in man-made or natural disaster management. Monitoring the environment for health risks due to biological, chemical, and radiation exposures (natural and made-made) is of increasing concern to protecting the public's health. For example, systems are now being developed and deployed to rapidly detect airborne bioterror agents. Although they do not directly relate to medical care, these applications designed to protect human health should properly be considered within the domain of public health informatics.",

Public health focuses on the health of the community, as opposed to that of the individual patient. In the medical care system, individuals with specific diseases or conditions are the primary concern. In public health, issues related to the community as the patient may require \"treatment\" such as disclosure of the disease status of an individual to prevent further spread of illness or even quarantining some individuals to protect others. Environmental factors, especially ones that that affect the health of populations over the long term (e.g. air quality), are also a special focus of the public health domain. Public health places a large emphasis on the prevention of disease and injury versus intervention after the problem has already occurred. To the extent that traditional medical care involves prevention, its focus is primarily on delivery of preventive services to individual patients.",

The assurance function is not limited to access to clinical care.

Surveillance in the public health context refers to the ongoing collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data on health conditions (e.g., breast cancer) and threats to health (e.g., smoking prevalence). Surveillance data represent one of the fundamental means by which priorities for public health action are set. Surveillance data are useful not only in the short term (e.g., in surveillance for acute infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and HIV/AIDS), but also in the longer term, e.g., in determining leading causes of premature death, injury, or disability. In either case, what distinguishes surveillance is that the data are collected for the purposes of action-either to guide a public health response (e.g., an outbreak investigation, or mitigation of a threat to a food or water source) or to help direct public health policy. A recent example of the latter is the surveillance data showing the dramatic rise in obesity in the United States. A tremendous amount of energy and public focus has been brought to bear on this problem-including a major DHHS program, the HealthierUS initiative-driven largely by compelling surveillance data. 1.

Hence, most public health information systems have focused on information about aggregate populations. Almost all medical information systems focus almost exclusively on identifying information about individuals. For example, almost any clinical laboratory system can quickly find Jane Smith's culture results. What public health practitioners want to know is the time trend of antibiotic resistance for the population that the clinic serves, or the trend for the population that the clinic actually covers. Most health care professionals are surprised to learn that there is no uniform national routine reporting -never mind information system -for most diseases, disabilities, risk factors, or prevention activities in the United States. In contrast, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway and Sweden have comprehensive systems in selected areas, such as occupational injuries, infectious diseases, and cancer; no country, however, has complete reporting for every problem. In fact, it is only births, deaths, and -to a lesser extentfetal deaths that are uniformly and relatively completely reported in the United States by the National Vital Statistics System, operated by the states and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

These systemsusually managed by state health departments and federal health agencies (largely the CDC) or their agents -provide periodic estimates of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and of certain risk factors (for example, smoking and obesity); however, because the data are from population samples, it is usually impossible to obtain estimates at a level of geographic detail finer than a region or state. Moreover, many of the behavioral indices are patient self-reported (although extensive validation studies have shown that they are good for trends and sometimes are more reliable than are data obtained from clinical systems). In the case of special surveys, such as CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), there is primary data entry into a CDC system. The data are complete, but the survey costs many millions of dollars, is done only every few years, and it takes years for the data to be made available.",

The CDC maintains dozens of surveillance systems that attempt to track completely the incidence of many conditions, including lead poisoning, injuries and deaths in the workplace, and birth defects. (Some of these systems use samples or cover only certain states or cities). As discussed above, there is also a list of about 60 notifiable diseases (revised every year) that the state epidemiologists and the CDC have determined are of national significance and warrant routine, complete reporting; however, it is up to providers to report the data, and reporting is still often done by telephone or mail, so the data are incomplete.

Even clinical data such as hospital infections is reentered. Why? All these systems grew up at the same time that information systems were being put in hospitals and clinics. Hence, there is duplicate data entry, which can result in the data being shallow, delayed, and subject to input error and recall bias. Furthermore, the systems themselves are often unpopular with state agencies and health care providers precisely because they require duplicate data entry (a child with lead poisoning and salmonella needs to be entered in two different CDC systems). The National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) is a major CDC initiative that addresses this issue by promoting the use of data and information system standards to advance the development of efficient, integrated, and interoperable surveillance systems at federal, state and local levels (see www.cdc.gov/nedss). This activity is designed to facilitate the electronic transfer of appropriate information from clinical information systems in the health care industry to public health departments, reduce provider burden in the provision of information, and enhance both the timeliness and quality of information provided. Now that historical and epidemiological forces are making the world smaller and causing lines between medicine and public health to blur, systems will need to be multifunctional, and clinical and public health systems will, of necessity, coalesce. What is needed are systems that can tell us about individuals and the world in which those individuals live. To fill that need, public health and clinical informaticians will need to work closely together to build the tools to study and control new and emerging threats such as bioterror, HIV/AIDS, SARS and its congeners, and the environmental effects of the shrinking ozone layer and greenhouse gases. It can be done. For example, in the late 1990's, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and the New York City Department of Health collaborated on the development of a tuberculosis registry for northern Manhattan, and the Emory University System of Health Care and the Georgia Department of Public Health built a similar system for tuberculosis monitoring and treatment in Atlanta. It is not by chance that these two cities each developed tuberculosis systems; rather, tuberculosis is a perfect example of what was once a public health problem (that affected primarily the poor and underserved) coming into the mainstream population as a result of an emerging infectious disease (AIDS), immigration, increased international travel, multidrug resistance, and our growing prison population. Hence, the changing ecology of disease, coupled with revolutionary changes in how health care is managed and paid for, will necessitate information systems that serve both individual medical and public health needs.",

Because CDC was proscribed by Congress from creating a single national immunization registry (due to privacy concerns), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, in cooperation with several other private foundations, established the All Kids Count (AKC) program that awarded funds to 24 states and communities in 1992 to assist in the development of immunization registries. AKC funded the best projects through a competitive process, recruited a talented staff to provide technical assistance, and made deliberate efforts to ensure sharing of the lessons learned, such as regular, highly interactive meetings of the grantees. Subsequent funding of 13 states by CDC and the Woodruff Foundation via the Information Network for Public Health Officials (INPHO) project (Baker et al., 1995) was greatly augmented by a presidential commitment to immunization registries announced in 1997 (White House, 1997) .

In particular, without assurances of ongoing operational funding, it will be difficult to secure the commitments needed for the development work. Naturally, an important tool for securing funding is development of a business case that shows the anticipated costs and benefits of the registry. While a substantial amount of information now exists about costs and benefits of immunization registries (Horne et al., 2000) , many of the registries that are currently operational had to develop their business cases prior to the availability of good quantitative data. Specific benefits associated with registries include preventing duplicative immunizations, eliminating the necessity to review the vaccination records for school and day care entry, and efficiencies in provider offices from the immediate availability of complete immunization history information and patient-specific vaccine schedule recommendations. The careful assessment of costs and benefits of specific immunization registry functions may also be helpful in prioritizing system requirements. As with all information systems, it is important to distinguish \"needs\" (those things people will pay for) from \"wants\" (those things people would like to have but are not willing to spend money on) (Rubin, 2003). Information system \"needs\" are typically supported by a strong business case, whereas \"wants\" often are not.",

Difficult design issues include data acquisition, database organization, identification and matching of children, generating immunization recommendations, and access to data, particularly for providers. Acquiring immunization data is perhaps the most challenging system design issue. Within the context of busy pediatric practices (where the majority of childhood immunizations are given), the data acquisition strategy must of necessity be extremely efficient. Ideally, information about immunizations would be extracted from existing electronic medical records or from streams of electronic billing data; either strategy should result in no additional work for participating providers. Unfortunately neither of these options is typically available. Electronic medical records are currently implemented only in roughly 10-15% of physician practices. While the use of billing records is appealing, it is often difficult to get such records on a timely basis without impinging on their primary function-namely, to generate revenue for the practice. Also, data quality, particularly with respect to duplicate records, is often a problem with billing information. A variety of approaches have been used to address this issue, including various forms of direct data entry as well as the use of bar codes (Yasnoff, 2003) .",

The operational needs for data access and data entry, as well as producing individual assessments of immunization status, often require different approaches to design compared to requirements for population-based immunization assessment, management of vaccine inventory, and generating recall and reminder notices. One particularly important database design decision for immunization registries is whether to represent immunization information by vaccine or by antigen. Vaccinebased representations map each available preparation, including those with multiple antigens, into its own specific data element. Antigen-based representations translate multi-component vaccines into their individual antigens prior to storage. In some cases, it may be desirable to represent the immunization information both ways. Specific consideration of required response times for specific queries must also be factored into key design decisions.",

Because it is relatively common for a child to receive immunizations from multiple providers, any system must be able to match information from multiple sources to complete an immunization record. In the absence of a national unique patient identifier, most immunization registries will assign an arbitrary number to each child. Of course, provisions must be made for the situation where this identification number is lost or unavailable. This requires a matching algorithm, which utilizes multiple items of demographic information to assess the probability that two records are really data from the same person. Development of such algorithms and optimization of their parameters has been the subject of active investigation in the context of immunization registries, particularly with respect to deduplication (Miller et al., 2001) .",

As more childhood vaccines have become available, both individually and in various combinations, the immunization schedule has become increasingly complex, especially if any delays occur in receiving doses, a child has a contraindication, or local issues require special consideration. The language used in the written guidelines is sometimes incomplete, not covering every potential situation. In addition, there is often some ambiguity with respect to definitions, e.g., for ages and intervals, making implementation of decision support systems problematic. Considering that the recommendations are updated relatively frequently, sometimes several times each year, maintaining software that produces accurate immunization recommendations is a continuing challenge. Accordingly, the implementation, testing, and maintenance of decision support systems to produce vaccine recommendations has been the subject of extensive study (Yasnoff & Miller, 2003) .",

Immunization registries have developed alternative data access methods such as fax-back and telephone query to address this problem.

In addition, clinical decision support (see Chapter 20) would be integrated with information delivery. In this way, clinicians could receive reminders of the most recent clinical guidelines and research results during the patient care process, thereby avoiding the need for superhuman memory capabilities to assure the effective practice of medicine.",

Numerous studies have shown that the complexity of present-day medical care results in very frequent errors of both omission and commission. This problem was clearly articulated at the 2001 meeting of the Institute of Medicine: \"Current practice depends upon the clinical decision making capacity and reliability of autonomous individual practitioners, for classes of problems that routinely exceed the bounds of unaided human cognition\" (Masys, 2001) . Electronic health information systems can contribute significantly to improving this problem by reminding practitioners about recommended actions at the point of care. This can include both notifications of actions that may have been missed, as well as warnings about planned treatments or procedures that may be harmful or unnecessary. Literally dozens of research studies have shown that such reminders improve safety and reduce costs (Kass, 2001; Bates, 2000) . In one such study (Bates et al., 1998) , medication errors were reduced by 55%.",

Our current system of disease surveillance, which depends on alert clinicians diagnosing and reporting unusual conditions, is both slow and potentially unreliable. Most disease reporting still occurs using the Postal Service, and the information is relayed from local to state to national public health authorities. Even when fax or phone is employed, the system still depends on the ability of clinicians to accurately recognize rare and unusual diseases. Even assuming such capabilities, individual clinicians cannot discern patterns of disease beyond their sphere of practice. These problems are illustrated by the seven unreported cases of cutaneous anthrax in the New York City area two weeks before the so-called \"index\" case in Florida in the Fall of 2001 (Lipton & Johnson, 2001) . Since all the patients were seen by different clinicians, the pattern could not have been evident to any of them even if the diagnosis had immediately been made in every case. Wagner et al have elucidated nine categories of requirements for surveillance systems for potential bioterrorism outbreaks-several categories must have immediate electronic reporting to insure early detection (Wagner et al., 2003) .",

Substantial additional savings are possible in the inpatient setting-numerous hospitals have reported large net savings from implementation of electronic health records. Another example, electronic prescribing, would not only reduce medication errors from transcription, but also drastically decrease the administrative costs of transferring prescription information from provider offices to pharmacies. A more recent analysis concluded that the total efficiency and patient safety savings from NHII would be in range of $142-371 billion each year (Hillestad et al., 2005) . While detailed studies of the potential savings from comprehensive implementation of NHII, including both electronic health records and effective exchange of health information, are still ongoing, it is clear that the cost reductions will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars each year. It is important to note that much of the savings depends not just on the widespread implementation of electronic health records, but the effective interchange of this information to insure that the complete medical record for every patient is immediately available in every care setting.",

Perhaps most problematic is the situation for individual and small group health care providers, who are being asked to make substantial allocations of resources to electronic health record systems that mostly benefit others. Mechanisms must be found to assure the equitable distribution of NHII benefits in proportion to investments made. While this issue is the subject of continuing study, early results indicate that most of the NHII financial benefit accrues to payers of care.

First and foremost, the existing models of health information infrastructures (e.g., Indianapolis and Spokane, WA) are based in local communities. This provides proof that it is possible to develop comprehensive electronic health care information exchange systems in these environments. In contrast, there is little or no evidence that such systems can be directly developed on a larger scale. Furthermore, increasing the size of informatics projects disproportionately increases their complexity and risk of failure. Therefore, keeping projects as small as possible is always a good strategy. Since NHII can be created by effectively connecting communities that have developed local health information infrastructures (LHIIs), it is not necessary to invoke a direct national approach to achieve the desired end result. A good analogy is the telephone network, which is composed of a large number of local exchanges that are then connected to each other to form community and then national and international networks.",

The level of trust needed seems most likely to be a product of personal relationships developed over time in a local community and motivated by a common desire to improve health care for everyone located in that area. While the technical implementation of information exchange is non-trivial, it pales in comparison to the challenges of establishing the underlying legal agreements and policy changes that must precede it. For example, when Indianapolis implemented sharing of patient information in hospital emergency rooms throughout the area, as many as 20 institutional lawyers needed to agree on the same contractual language (Overhage, 2002) .",

This also allows for customized approaches sensitive to the specific needs of each local community.

Similarly, other demographic and organizational differences as well as the presence of specific highly specialized medical care institutions make each community's health care system unique.

Bioterrorism preparedness in particular is now a key national priority, especially following the anthrax attacks that occurred in the Fall of 2001. Early detection of bioterrorism is critical to minimize morbidity and mortality. This is because, unlike other terrorist attacks, bioterrorism is usually silent at first. Its consequences are usually the first evidence that an attack has occurred. Traditional public health surveillance depends on alert clinicians reporting unusual diseases and conditions. However, it is difficult for clinicians to detect rare and unusual diseases since they are neither familiar with their manifestations nor suspicious of the possibility of an attack. Also, it is often difficult to differentiate potential bioterrorism from more common and benign manifestations of illness. This is clearly illustrated by the seven cases of cutaneous anthrax that occurred in the New York City area two weeks prior to the \"index \" case in Florida the Fall of 2001 (Lipton & Johnson, 2001) . All these cases presented to different clinicians, none of whom recognized the diagnosis of anthrax with sufficient confidence to notify any public health authority. Furthermore, such a pattern involving similar cases presenting to multiple clinicians could not possibly be detected by any of them. It seems likely that had all seven of these patients utilized the same provider, the immediately evident pattern of unusual signs and symptoms alone would have been sufficient to result in an immediate notification of public health authorities even in the absence of any diagnosis.",
