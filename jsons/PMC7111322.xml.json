Moreover, the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3], bird flu [4], influenza (H1N1 and H5N1) [4], [5] and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [6] have attracted growing concerns on the airborne transmission within the surrounding of buildings, particularly in crowded urban areas. In order to establish effective indoor air pollution control strategies, it is quite beneficial to have a profound understanding of the mechanism and characteristics of airborne pollutant transmission and dispersion in and around buildings.",

            "text": "Many previous researches performed on the airflow and contaminant distributions around buildings have laid a good foundation for the study of pollutant transmission. Field tests [7], [8], [9], wind tunnel experiments [10], [11], [12] and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods [13], [14], [15] have been carried out on the investigations of contaminant dispersion in and near street canyons, building arrays and an isolated building. During the outbreak of SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, the inter-flat cross contamination was identified as an important airborne transmission path and started to be examined. Using CFD and multizone modeling, Yu and Li et al. [16], [17] provided the identification of the airborne transmission of the SARS virus by analysing the distribution of infected cases in the Amoy Gardens in 2003. On this basis, on-site tracer gas measurements conducted by Niu and Tung [18] at Hong Kong primarily focused on the pollutant transmission path through windows dominated by buoyancy effect under single-sided natural ventilation, and they found out that the indoor air of the immediate upper unit contained up to 7% of the exhaust air from lower unit and concluded that the windows on the same fa\u00e7ade can be a major route for the vertical spread of air contaminants. Gao et al. [19] numerically investigated the combined effect of wind and buoyancy on the airborne transmission of infection between flats. It was discovered that the wind blowing orthogonally to the building openings could either enhance or restrain the upward transport. Both of their studies only focused on the upward cross-contamination between two vertically adjacent flats. Later, wind tunnel studies performed by Liu et al. [20], [21] and Wang et al. [22] explored the wind effect on the pollutant dispersion around cross (#) shape buildings. The experiment results illustrated that the pollutant could spread along both upward and downward direction in the re-entry space. Horizontal dispersion was also found by analysing the tracer gas concentration. It was stated that the dispersion characteristics can be affected by source location and wind directions. Their findings are limited to the complicated shape buildings with re-entry space. More recently, Ai et al. [23], [24], [25] numerically studied the wind induced inter-unit dispersion mechanism of gaseous pollutants in two five-storey hypothetical slab-like buildings. The tracer gas dispersion characteristics on the windward and leeward sides were revealed and compared with the cross (#) shape buildings. The results showed that the tracer gas had quite different dilution speeds in both horizontal and vertical directions for the two different shapes. Wu [26] carried out on-site measurement to investigate the internal spread route between horizontal adjacent units induced by air infiltration and found that the cross-infection risk through this route could be 9%, even higher than that through single-sided open windows. Wu [27] also made effort on the prevention of vertical cross-unit infections dominated by single-sided ventilation. Such inter-flat transmission cases through building fa\u00e7ade openings with single-sided ventilation or by air infiltration have been paid attention to, while the transmission through internal openings under cross ventilation mode which was dominated by the wind effect as well is less studied.",

Both single-sided and cross ventilation mode were considered. A rectangular multi-storey residential building was set as the research object in wind tunnel tests. Tracer gas technique was adopted to simulate the gaseous pollutant or fine particles. Previous research [30], [31], [32] found that particles with sizes of 1\u201320 \u03bcm could suspend and spread in the air, small-size particles less than 1.0 \u03bcm transport like gaseous pollutants. The wind induced inter-flat spread of contamination has an inalienable relationship with the airflow patterns inside and around the building. Hence, different wind directions could lead to diverse pollutant concentration distributions. The approaching wind angle was set as one of the key factors in the experiments. The results will not only be helpful for respiratory disease control, but also be used in relative fields, such as dispersion of atmospheric pollutants, hazardous releases, flue gases, etc.",

Snyder [34] pointed out that five non-dimensional parameters, i.e. Rossby (Ro), Reynolds (Re), Schmidt (Sc), Peclet (Pe) and Froude (Fr) numbers should be paid attention to. However, it is impractical and impossible to duplicate all the non-dimensional parameters in wind tunnel tests. Some of these parameters can be ignored in view of their poor relative importance when simulating pollutant dispersion in and around buildings without thermal effect. The Reynolds number independence should be considered as in several previous publications [35]. Meroney [36] suggested that the wind speed in a laboratory should be high enough, so that the obstacle Reynolds number exceeds 1.5 \u00d7 104. In this study, the building Reynolds number is defined as Re = U\nref\nH\nb/\u03bd, where \u03bd refers to kinematic viscosity and H\nb is the building height, i.e. 0.59 m. The measured velocity U\nref was 2.89 m/s, and the corresponding Reynolds number was 1.15 \u00d7 105, which was high enough to ensure the experiment results to be independent of the Reynolds number.",

For cases under normal wind direction, on the windward side (Fig. 5(a)), the airflow pattern generally contains an upwash region, a stagnation zone, a downwash region and an upwind vortex near the ground. The stagnation zone is at about 1/2 to 2/3 of the building height, and the outflowing air from the stagnation area spreads to all around. On the leeward side (Fig. 5(b)), a large recirculation flow along the building height and a small vortex at the bottom corner are formed. On the sideward (Fig. 5(c)), the flow pattern comprises a reverse flow, a fluctuating reattachment flow and a sweeping flow. Under the condition of oblique wind direction, on the windward fa\u00e7ade (Fig. 5(d)), the airflow pattern is fairly characterized by a distinct upstream-to-downstream sweeping flow. On the lower 2/3 to 1/4 of the building upwind fa\u00e7ade, the surface airflow has a downward velocity component. On the leeward fa\u00e7ade (Fig. 5(e)), the airflow pattern is mainly formed by the integration of an upwash flow, a horizontal downstream-to-upstream reverse flow and sometimes a slight reattachment flow. Since the building openings, such as windows and doors, could affect the stream patterns in and around the building to some extent, in present wind tunnel experiments the building model includes windows and doors to take the internal airflows into account.",

A mesh system with 3.6 \u00d7 106 grids was used. The renormalization group (RNG) k-\u03b5 model was adopted to simulate the turbulent effect. The standard wall function was used with 30 < y+ <60. The approaching wind profile obtained from the experiment was used as numerical inflow condition. To validate the reliability of simulation results, the mean velocity distributions along four vertical lines in single-sided ventilation building under normal wind direction are shown in Fig. 7\n. It can be seen that the present setting for CFD method is accurate enough to predict the airflow around the building model, except for the reverse flow above the building roof and the downstream wake flow. According to a large number of researches on the comparisons and verifications of CFD results from Architectural Institute of Japan [38], [39], despite the inaccuracies of RNG k-\u03b5 model in predicting the vortex-shedding effects especially in the building wake, the detailed and overall spatial flow patterns obtained by RNG k-\u03b5 model can be identified and as a reference qualitatively.",

A sharp decrease of concentration was observed in the upward vertical direction of UR column, while the concentration descended slowly for lower flats. The concentrations along the other two columns were also very low, which were two orders of magnitude lower than that in the source flat. The results indicated that the tracer gas was more likely to move vertically downward rather than upward or horizontally, according with the qualitatively consistent airflow patterns shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 9\n. On the leeward fa\u00e7ade, all of the concentration values were only one order of magnitude lower than the source floor, and their variation with floor and column was negligible. Besides, tracer gas generated quite high concentrations at the corridor window horizontally closest to the source column.

Therefore, in the vertical direction, the concentration profile shows a symmetrical shape. The concentrations were at the same order of magnitude with or only one order of magnitude lower than that in the same floor of UR column, except unit UM3rd and UL3rd. In cross natural ventilation mode under normal wind direction, the airflow patterns were more complicated if compared with Model A, especially in the indoor space and on the leeward side of the building. The airflow directly passed through windows and doors of the units, forming several vortexes in the corridor and on the leeward side around the openings, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Consequently, the tracer gas released from UR3rd is mainly transported to the inner space of Model B at the third floor. Contributing to the vortexes in the corridor and near the downwind windows, the tracer gas dispersed to leeward flats, leading to high concentration levels. The results indicated that the vertical inter-flat pollutant transmission could be confined by cross ventilation, but the horizontal inter-flat transmission was still distinct.",

On the windward fa\u00e7ade, the tracer gas concentrations at each floor were at the same magnitude level for column UR, UM, and UL. This implied that the tracer gas tended to quickly move in the horizontal direction from UR to UM and UL column, namely from upstream to downstream, which was quite different from the distribution feature under normal wind direction (as shown in Fig. 8(a)). Along the vertical direction, the tracer gas concentrations at the lower flats were generally higher than those in the upper flats, caused by the downwash flow in the front of the building (see the qualitatively similar airflow in Fig. 5, Fig. 11\n(a1)). For flats on the leeward fa\u00e7ade, the concentrations were only one order of magnitude lower than that in the source flat as well, and again they seemed to be not sensitive to the height. It should be noticed that the leeward concentration level was significant even compared with the windward concentration. Especially for the floor 4, 5, and 6, the concentration was higher than the one in the corresponding windward floor. It was interesting that the concentration at CR and CL was lower than that at the three leeward columns although they were closer to the pollutant source. As shown in Fig. 11(a2), the air moved along the wall surface of CR, UR, UM and UL and then detached at the building edges. Next the air from \u201cU\u201d side reattached at the downstream part of \u201cCL\u201d side and then flowed to \u201cD\u201d side. So the pollutant released from UR3rd unit would not tend to move to CR and CL column, but rather spread to \u201cD\u201d side with the reverse flow.",

On the other hand, the concentration in every column is not susceptible to the height, especially the \u201cD\u201d and \u201cC\u201d sides. Fig. 13(a) suggests the airflow patterns at the source location height in Model A. A reverse flow from downstream to upstream along the side fa\u00e7ade was observed. According to such a flow direction, if the tracer gas was released from UR3rd unit, there should be a small chance for the tracer gas to be transported to UM and UL flats. However, the experimental data proved that due to the diffusion effect, velocity fluctuation, and the large circulation at the side fa\u00e7ade, all the flats on the source fa\u00e7ade were affected evidently. For the units at the opposite side to the source unit, the concentrations were almost lowered by one order of magnitude. It might be contributed to the reverse flow from leeward area to side area. Since CR column was on the windward side and CL was on the leeward side, the approaching wind blew from CR to CL through the corridors, the tracer gas released from side fa\u00e7ades could hardly be monitored at these two columns.",
