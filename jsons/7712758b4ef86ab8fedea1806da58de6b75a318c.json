            "text": "Background& Aims: 2 The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global epidemic and has caused a 3 lasting and huge loss of life security, economic development and social stability in more than 180 4 countries around the world. Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, 5 therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the 6 best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against 7 bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective 8 approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and 9 efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic 10 human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of Methods: 12 Firstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence 13 of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter 14 to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five 15 male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the 16 acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to 17 provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and 18 possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 10 8 CFU /kg/day, 19 considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6 20 x 10 8 CFU/kg/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 10 10 CFU/ /kg/day to rats. In 21 order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 10 10 22 /animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37 23 in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat# 24 HK321).",

The rVSV-SARS and rVSV-SARS-CoV2 recombinant viruses were 13 constructed by replacing the G protein of VSV with the S protein of SARS and SARS-CoV2, and the 14 S protein was displayed on the surface of the VSV virus, respectively. The recombinant virus can 15 simulate the infection process of SARS and SARS-CoV2. 16 17 To verify LL-37 effect in inhibiting SARS virus, packaged rVSV-SARS virus was diluted to 2000 18 ffu/ml as virus solution. LL-37 was then diluted to 0 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml, 10000 19 ng/ml, 100000 ng/ml using virus solution to get different concentrations of treatment solution.
