Eric Drexler, in 1986 , published book \"Engines of Creation\" in which he described his ideas of molecular nanotechnology used to build miniature machines and devices from the bottom up using selfassembly. Many scientists from mainstream disciplines-biology, chemistry or physics-will argue of course that they are and have been 'doing' nanotechnology for years and that it is nothing new. Indeed chemists play with atoms and molecules which are sub-nano and molecular biology deals with the understanding and application of biological nano-scale components. Nature has used nanotechnology and, in fact, it has taken millions of years to develop this by a process of evolution and natural selection. Nanotechnology is an emerging research field which promises to have a wide range of interesting applications. Nanotechnology encompasses all technology that aims to create nanometre-scaled structures or is able to address or manipulate matter at the nanometre level.",

He described that DNA computing is the ability to drive computations, store data and retrieve data through the structure and use of DNA molecules. DNA computing requires understanding of the molecule. For example, molecules are made up of atoms; the atoms contain protons, neutrons and electrons. The molecule can be a combination of atoms such as water molecule (H 2 O). The nanotechnology aspect involves the ability of man to alter and control the makeup of the atom within the molecule.",

To begin with, the idea of DNA computing is similar to the action of DNA. One strand of DNA houses the 'RAM' or memory, the other strand is a backup (like Raid 0 + 1 on disk). The enzymes are the motors that copy, search, access, read/write the information into the DNA strands. When the DNA is put into an aqueous solution (like water), and the data is added, the data or information finds the appropriate DNA component to combine with and attaches itself. The data is usually in the form of a chemical solution with its own enzymes, providing motion or movement to the atoms. Once the atoms bind, they cannot be unbound without changing the environment. Changing the environment may mean making it \"unfriendly\" to the data; thus the enzymes uncouple the chemically bonded elements (data) and return it to its previous state.",

For error correction this is very important. It gives the nano-computer a chance to correct what should be a comparable equivalent (copy) of the data. Such is the way of Raid 0+1 disk arrays. For example, if there are four values per atom, each atom taking 0.35 microns across, this would be impressive for storage sizes. If we want to think about modeling the information, we must consider the first two-dimensional mode (2D) atoms with electrons; different atoms tied together through valence bonding, providing a surface area to the molecule and a chemical make up. The three-dimensional (3D) model allows for multiple twists of the atomic layers. Dan E. Linstedt in his document cited: compression and encryption algorithms have already been developed, tested and used in DNA computing.

They consider Bioinformatics as a coherent abstraction in devising, prototyping, design, optimization and analysis of complex nanosystems. Nano and microscale biological systems exist in nature in enormous variety and sophistication. They are applying complex biological patterns in order to devise, analyze and examine distinct systems. One cannot blindly copy biosystems due to the fact that many complex phenomena and effects have not been comprehended and system architectures and functionalities have not been fully examined. Typical examples include unsolved problems to comprehend the simplest Eschericchia Coli (E. coli) and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria that integrate three dimensional biocircuitary, computing processing, networking nanobioelectronics, nanobiomotors, nanobiosensors, etc. Correspondingly, attention is also concentrated on devising novel paradigms in systematic synthesis through Bioinformatics with the ultimate objective to fabricate these systems applying nanotechnology. This will allow one to derive new operating principles examining functionality of different subsystems, researching novel structures, studying advanced architectures (topologies) and characterizing distinct systems, subsystems and devices reaching the nanoarchitectionomics horizon. The scientist examines complex patterns in biosystems because superior system can be devised and designed through engineering Bioinformatics to achieve ultimate objective of engineering bioinformatics and system design. These are far-reaching frontiers of modern nanoscience and nanoengineering. The synergetic paradigm reported is demonstrated researching biosystems and coherently examining distinct nanostructures, complex and subsystems (Lyshenski et al., 2003) .",

A greater understanding of the human biology of cancer revealed from patients will complement and stimulate new laboratory investigations in vitro and in silico, linking delivery back to discovery in the continuum. Tomorrow's patients will know their susceptibility to cancer and the lifestyle factors needed to keep healthy. Molecular epidemiology and gene/environment interactions will help determine populations at risk. Emphasis on cancer biology will permit a systems approach to understand the cancer process.

After several days of effort, scientists managed to produce one millionth of a gram of the genetic material on April 6, 2003. To sequence the SARS genome, the genome was broken in manageable fragments. Within a week, all the fragments had been sequenced. Once started, the sequencing itself was \"fairly routine\". The sequenced genome fragments were then assembled into the complete genome in 12 mers under UV light, electromer pairs are created. The negative electrons and positive holes create very strong oxidizers, called hydroxide radical, even stronger than chlorine used as a sterilizer. When harmful substances stick to the positive holes, they are completely broken down into the carbon dioxide and other harmless compounds.
