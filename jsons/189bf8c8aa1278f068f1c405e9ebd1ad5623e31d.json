I designed a novel tool named the DNA nucleotide footprint plotter. corona strains (Fig 6) . Even if the method is designed to observe structural changes at the genomic level that single nucleotide polymorphism calling tools cannot identify, it is possible to show genotype changes and amino acid changes at a single nucleotide resolution. In addition, DNA footprint plotter is a useful tool to determine the evidence of recombination. A recombination between Corona virus There are three ways to plot DNA footprint plots. They are ACat, AGac, and ATag. ACat is used as an example. If the nucleotide is A, then x value plusses 1 (X+1). If the nucleotide is T, then x value minuses 1 (X-1). If the nucleotide is C, then y value plusses 1 (Y+1). If the nucleotide is G, then y value minuses 1 (Y- The method aims to demonstrate structural variations at higher levels that single nucleotide mutation callers cannot identify. However, the tool can precisely demonstrate single nucleotide information (Fig6). The method itself has no limit to plot the number of nucleotide bases. But due to the size of computer screens and paper, too many bases will cause the lines to overlay each other. Thus the sizes of virus genome or segments of eukaryote genome are recommended for one particular plot. One plot can display a complete virus genome, and users can combine multiple plots together to visualize more complicated genomes such as the genomes of eukaryotes. Or if only a partial virus genome or a particular gene are of interest, the corresponding regions can be displayed by DNA foot plotter. ",

ACat plot of USA_MT188340 (29845bp) versus Italy_MT066156 (29867bp) Another intuitive way is to color in footprint plots, and it can be helpful to distinguish different can quickly distinguish the infection type of patients given the sequencing data. It can demonstrate the characteristics of different types of viruses and increase the confidence of diagnosis such as flu, coronavirus, or SARS-cov. In addition to specific visualization of coronavirus genome key features, it can be applied to recognize various virus genomes in general and to compare subtypes of the same virus species. The better understanding of virus genomes will lead to a more accurate diagnosis, which lays the foundation of appropriate therapeutic options. It can also help the prevention of the disease by guiding vaccine design. One example is that the tool can display which regions are similar among various virus subtypes and which regions are different. This will facilitate the design of vaccines targeting similar regions among different virus sub-species. In this way, one vaccine can fight different types of viruses.",
