During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac",

Some early candidates have included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, and others. Some of these are known to pose a risk of ventricular arrhythmia. With an uncertain degree of potential for benefit, an assessment of risk of therapy should be undertaken. During the pandemic, avoidance of nonessential testing, including electrocardiography (ECG), reduces exposure of health care workers and other patients to infectious risk and is therefore recommended when possible. 1 An expert writing group of members of the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society was selected to derive a set of consensus-based recommendations to guide clinicians.

The French study was nonrandomized, and the preliminary report included only viral RNA detection from nasopharyngeal swabs as its primary end point rather than clinical outcomes. Although limited, the data have been sufficient to prompt recommendations for treatment from national agencies in China and Italy. The overall safety of these drugs has been established over several decades of use, with good cardiovascular safety profiles in small studies. However, cases of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP) have been reported. Larger cohort studies have focused on the low risk of retinopathy associated with chronic administration.

Patients with inherited death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions. These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available. 91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136 long QT syndrome are known to be at increased risk. Expert opinion may be helpful in determining how best to mitigate risk for patients with prolonged baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) who have COVID-19. The use of other drugs or medical conditions that may prolong the QT interval or otherwise interact with these medications may increase risk of adverse events. Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval in vulnerable patients may be exacerbated in older patients, by coexistent cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy, ischemia, heart failure, or bradycardia, and by other conditions such as diabetes, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, or renal failure. It is possible that severe cases of COVID-19 would be more vulnerable to QT interval prolongation as well. It is likely that patients at higher clinical risk of drug-induced arrhythmia would also be at higher risk for more severe infectious complications and are more likely to be treated as inpatients, in which case ECG monitoring would more likely be indicated for supportive medical care.

The QT interval is measured from the onset of the QRS (where it first deviates from baseline) to the intersection of the tangent of the downslope (dotted green line) with the baseline (TP segment, dotted blue line). This is corrected for heart rate by dividing by the square root of the RR interval, measured in seconds. In the presence of QRS widening (eg, bundle branch block or paced ventricular rhythm), QTc can be adjusted by subtracting the QRS duration (QRSd) that is in excess of 100 ms as in the following formula: QTc\u00f0adjusted\u00de \u00bc QTc\u00f0measured\u00de \u00c0 \u00f0QRSd \u00c0 100\u00de.

Potential mitigations could include use of cardiac monitoring or repeated QTc checks. Risk and potential benefit should be individually assessed. For patients with no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death and who are not taking other medications that may prolong the QT interval, as well as patients with a previous known normal QTc, it may be reasonable to proceed with antimicrobial drug administration without a baseline or follow-up ECG if obtaining an ECG may increase population risk of infection.
