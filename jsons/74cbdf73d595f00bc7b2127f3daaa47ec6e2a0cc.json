The patient denied any sphincter disturbances, dyspnea or swallowing difficulties. She first received a diagnosis of RA exacerbation but no improvement was seen after corticosteroids increase. At admission to our Neurology department, at the tenth day of symptom's onset (April 13), neurological examination showed quadriplegia, hypotonia, areflexia and bilateral positive Las\u00e8gue sign. Cranial nerves were intact. Temperature, lung and cardiac auscultation were, also normal. On April 1st, three days prior to the ongoing symptom's onset, the patient presented an episode of dry cough without dyspnea or fever, spontaneously resolving within 48 hours. Initial blood tests showed no abnormality, except for a lymphocytopenia (520/ml, normal: 1500-5000). with normal white blood cell count. Chest CT (day 10) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lung (Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay was positive at oropharyngeal swab (day 10), negative in CSF. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (2g/kg for 5 days) and a combination of Hydroxychloroquine (600mg per day) and",

After this first case, we found three other reports published to date. Camdessanche et al.

These findings were consistent with an Acute Motor and Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN) subtype of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS).
