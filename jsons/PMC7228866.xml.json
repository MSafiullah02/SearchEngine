This would allow an increase to 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. Implementing nationwide PCR testing in the US would require $13 million and $64 million per week for the two strategies, respectively, with a return of $165 million and $767 million to providers, respectively. The numbers of healthcare workers potentially infected in the endoscopy unit on a weekly basis were estimated at 65 and 325 for the two strategies, respectively. \"At the present rate of infection in low-prevalence populations, such as our center, this intervention seems safe over a 3-month period,\" note the researchers.",
