Based on our previous work on the Big Data Readiness Index (BDRI) we place the focus on one under-investigated aspect of big data: the linkage to happiness. The BDRI, applied on Africa, includes the topic of happiness within the digital wellbeing driver, but the link between the two topics requires further investigation. Thus, two underlying questions emerge: what is the relation between happiness and big data? And how does Africa perform in digital wellbeing? This paper includes a structured literature review highlighting five key clusters indicating this link. Furthermore, we present some first empirical insights using the BDRI focusing on Africa. Overall, the African continent performs best in the social inclusion cluster of happiness, with the most room for improvement in the job creation cluster.",

Variety highlights the fact that big data is generated from a large number of sources, formats and types that include structured and unstructured data [14] . A fourth v for value and a fifth for veracity was subsequently suggested, sometimes referred to as verification. Value emphasizes the importance of extracting economic benefits from data [15, 16] . Veracity stresses the importance of data quality and includes security measures and techniques to assure trustworthy big data analysis results [17, 18] . This paper considers big data as the overarching approach of collecting, managing, processing and gaining value from the 5 Vs (volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value).

Due to these challenges, Africa has often been referred to as the continent of missing data. Duermeijer et al. [19] confirms that Africa produces less than 1% of the world's research even though 12,5% of the world's population is from Africa. With regard to published big data related literature up to 2015, most authors are from China, the USA, Australia, the UK and Korea [20] . This unequal geographic coverage raises the question whether this is due to a global big data divide or lack of essential knowledge to undertake big data studies [6] . If big data implementation excludes the developing world, it can lead to greater inequalities. Additional challenges such as data availability and infrastructure hinder easy implementation of big data analytics, but the implementation of big data itself can have large positive effects to alleviate these initial shortcomings [21] .",

For this review, we apply a hybrid approach of systematicity [26] , because we are particularly interested in the combination of the two terms \"happiness\" and \"big data\". Thus, we exclude articles that can be associated with only one of the key terms to achieve a holistic review of all scientific articles that combine both terms.

We applied a set of three major criteria to limit the number of articles to a reasonable and suitable number for our purposes. First, we downloaded and screened the title, keywords and abstracts of all articles and used this as first methodological screening criteria [26] . In this step duplicated articles, non-English articles and certain types of articles such as short editor's notes as a preface or front and back matters were eliminated (A). Furthermore, we eliminated articles that are directly related to the medical or health sector: they use happiness in the context of wellbeing after medical treatment, which is out of scope for this study (B). In a final step, we conducted an individual screening of all the articles and applied final content-related criteria. All articles were removed which refer only once to either of the two core terms. These articles appear correctly as search results but provide a very vague connection between the two terms at most. Additionally, we eliminated articles that are out of scope (C). In total, 20 articles with a strong relation between the terms \"happiness\" and \"big data\" remained after the three elimination steps.

We screened the articles and aggregated them according to central themes, research areas and methodology. These clusters from the BDRI will be explained in this section, specifically indicating how big data could affect mentioned clusters and how this in turn effects happiness, thereby establishing the general relation between big data and happiness. A first cluster we could identify can be associated with jobs, specifically job creation and increased productivity. According to one paper we associated with this cluster, Frey and Stutzer [28] , unemployment has a strong negative effect on the individual as well as an entire society. Consequently, lowering unemployment potentially leads to greater levels of happiness, greater bonds towards a community, and life satisfaction [29] . This effect is even stronger for younger adults [30] . The implementation of big data concepts can support the process of job creation in general, but it is diverse with regard to different target groups within a society. New jobs will predominantly increase happiness of a minority, which due to a reasonable level of education, has the option to work in big data fields. To address job creation coherently, we put our focus on big data concepts that also impact existing jobs. Heeks [31] uses Bhutan as an example where e-agriculture can assist farmers who represent the majority of the population. In this example, big data concepts support agricultural extension, better planting, cropping, animal husbandry, and monitoring market prices for better market revenue. Implementation of big data analytics can not only improve productivity within existing jobs but also lead to creation of new jobs. Evidently, a meaningful source of income and higher productivity has positive impacts on the level of happiness in society, explaining how through this cluster job creation and productivity big data can contribute to happiness.",

The government can use big data technologies for improved decision making and implementing policies more effectively. Two real-life examples include the use of mobile phone data and airtime credit purchases to estimate food security in East Africa or using mining citizen feedback data in order to gain input for government decision making in Indonesia [40, 41] . This reveals that big data can lead to better governance, which in turn will impact overall happiness, as shown by happiness-studies. In addition, our literature review revealed other than politically driven contexts of happiness, through life satisfaction of people influenced by their residential status. Jokela et al.

As people, we are highly dependent on our environment for daily living, especially in developing regions such as Africa where agriculture is still the largest sector in more than half of the countries [5] . Particularly big data concepts that address superordinate living conditions are relevant. One example from our literature review is a study by Zhao et al. [43] linking wellbeing, amongst other things, with economic growth and green space in larger Chinese cities. Results reveal a significant positive relationship between wellbeing and a high percentage of green space in a city. A healthy environment includes low levels of pollution, good water quality as well as the concept of sustainability that is gaining popularity especially among millennials [44] . Cloutier et al. [45] show how well individual cities and communities embrace sustainable practices and how these practices translate to opportunities for residents to pursue happiness. Applying big data to have smart cities, will lead to a more sustainable and effective society, and by doing so the healthier environment cluster is the fifth identified cluster through which big data relates to higher levels of happiness.",
