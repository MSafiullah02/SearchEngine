            "text": "The exacerbation of asthma in house dust mite (HDM)\u2010allergic people usually results from non\u2010allergenic triggers such as a virus infection acting on inflamed airways rather than an increased response to allergens [1]. Recent studies of the IgE anti\u2010HDM antibody profile of children attending an emergency department, however, showed that while HDM\u2010allergic children with exacerbations had similar IgE responses to those of allergic children from a community cohort, they had strikingly reduced IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies [2]. The prevalence was reduced from 92% to 33%. This suggests the IgG antibodies could have direct protective effects as shown in experimental models [3] or be markers for a regulatory response. Allergic sensitization is also associated with aberrant antibody responses to other antigens. The authors have shown decreased IgG1 antibodies to the protective P6 outer membrane protein antigen of the nasopharyngeal colonizing bacterium Haemophilus influenzae in infancy, and the production of IgG4 antibodies in some atopic but not non\u2010atopic people [4]. Asthma exacerbations are associated with intensified inflammation and increased IL\u20106 and T\u2010helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine production with decreases in IL\u201010 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and may influence antibody responses. The study here has accordingly examined anti\u2010allergen antibody responses at exacerbation and during convalescence and possible bystander effects as judged by antibody responses to the P6 outer membrane protein. Because rhinovirus (RV) infection was detected in many of the children, responses in the absence or presence of known virus infection were examined. Convalescence was associated with some decrease in IgE anti\u2010allergen antibodies but there was no increase for IgG. There was also no change in IgG antibody to the P6 antigen even though IgG1 to P6 and HDM was found to be decreased in those subjects with frequent episodic or persistent asthma. Strikingly over 60% of the convalescent children had increased IgE to the anti\u2010P6 outer membrane protein with titres that were often similar to those induced by major allergens.",

Peripheral blood samples were obtained as soon as possible after initiation of treatment and within 24 h of presentation to the hospital and plasma were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. A further blood sample was obtained after the acute attack, when the child was clinically well. The median time between acute and convalescent visits was 9.5 weeks (interquartile range 7.2\u201321.1 weeks). The standard management of children presenting with an asthma exacerbation at PMH included oxygen supplementation if saturations were 94%, \u03b22\u2010agonists (salbutamol) and an anticholinergic (ipratropium bromide) via metered dose inhaler with large volume spacer at 20\u2010min intervals for the first hour, and prednisolone 1 mg/kg (maximum 40 mgs) orally. Oral steroids were rarely used beyond 2 days after the exacerbation. Antibiotics were not administered on admission and only one child had any history of recorded antibiotic use either before the acute attack or at convalescence. The severity of the acute asthma attack at presentation was determined using a previously validated scoring system with a possible score of 5\u201315 determined for each subject: 5\u20137 mild, 8\u201311 moderate, 12\u201315 severe [10]. The pattern of asthma severity was also assessed according to National Asthma Council of Australia guidelines to determine whether children suffered from infrequent episodic, frequent episodic, or persistent asthma exacerbations [11]. Parents of all participants gave informed consent and the Ethics Committee of King Edward Memorial and Princess Margaret Hospitals, Western Australia, approved the study.",

The secretions were eluted in 2 mL of saline and transported immediately to the laboratory for the detection of common viral respiratory pathogens. PNA's were collected from 39/53 HDM\u2010allergic children at admission to hospital in order to identify the presence of viral infection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (Ad), influenza (InfV) and parainfluenza (PIV) viruses were either identified by direct immunofluorescence (IF) using virus\u2010specific monoclonal antibodies or were isolated in cell culture (LLC\u2013MK2, A549 and MRC5 cell lines) and identified by indirect IF by PMH (Subiaco, Western Australia). RV, human metapneumovirus (MPV) and coronavirus (CoV) were detected by RNA extraction and RT\u2010PCR). RV and CoV were identified by PathWest (QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands, Western Australia) and MPV was identified by PMH. Some samples were re\u2010analysed with the Respiratory MultiCode\u2010PLx Assay (RMA), a new multiplex PCR assay [12], to confirm or detect the presence of RSV, Ad, InfV, PIV, RV. MPV, CoV and enterovirus. The RMA assay, which can detect 20 copies of cDNA, detected 25% more positive RV samples than the PCR assays conducted by PathWest at that time. The lower detection rate by PCR was due to deficiencies in the assay that have subsequently been amended in that samples that were tested more recently gave the same results as the RMA.",

            "text": "During convalescence the titres of IgE immunoglobulin and IgE antibody to HDM allergens decreased for the majority of children and this occurred for the major Der p 1 and Der p 2 as well as the mid\u2010potency Der p 5 and 7 allergens. When the difference between the acute and convalescent IgE anti\u2010HDM titres in the virus positive and virus negative groups were analysed separately, the patients without a virus infection showed a twofold reduction in titre while the average titre for the virus positive group were reduced sixfold and this was statistically significant. A possible reason for this is that the RV infection had caused a transient increase before presentation so there was a greater decline in convalescence. The reductions should, however, be viewed in the context that the IgE titres detected during the exacerbations were no higher than those detected for children with stable asthma [2] and that the decreases were usually only to levels still within the range commonly found during the exacerbations. Because the children were administered increased medication after the exacerbation, particularly corticosteroids, the treatment, as reported by some investigators [16, 17, 18], could be a possible cause of the decline. However, regardless of the mechanism responsible for the decreased IgE, the reduction would be beneficial for the patient. As well as reducing responses to HDM allergen the decrease in total IgE would reduce the allergen\u2010independent Fc\u025bR1 binding that activate mast cells and stabilize receptor expression [19]. It was previously found that the children recruited from the emergency department with an asthma exacerbation had markedly less IgG antibody to mite allergens than children with stable asthma [2] with a prevalence of 33 compared with 92%. While some individual changes of IgG were found in convalescence they were both up and down, with most titres remaining negative. An IgG response was thus not restored over the period of convalescence but this remains an important feature to study for the susceptibility to acute attacks of asthma. When the summated IgG1 titres for all the HDM allergens were analysed they in fact declined during the convalescence period but only for the group without associated RV infection. The potential significance of the low IgG antibody was further underscored by the finding here that the summated IgG1 titres to the HDM allergens were the lowest in the patients with frequent episodic and persistent asthma. Animal studies have demonstrated that there are several mechanisms by which IgG antibodies can ameliorate allergic responses in vivo [3] so the sustained low titres in children with exacerbations and the association of low titres with persistent disease suggests they may be protective for human asthma.",

            "text": "A previous study measured antibodies to the P6 outer membrane protein of H. influenzae as a potential mucosal bystander antigen to the responses to allergen [4]. A dysregulation of the response to P6 was found with atopic infants showing a slow development of IgG1 antibodies, then for the most atopic, the subsequent development of IgG4 antibodies, an isotype rarely found in the antibody responses of non\u2010atopic subjects. Although the regulation of IgG subclasses in humans does not show the clear Th1 and Th2 demarcation of cytokine regulation found in mice and is still being investigated [20], IgG4 antibody is strongly associated with Th2 responses and is preferentially up\u2010regulated over IgG1 by the Th2 transcription factor GATA\u20103 [21]. Our observations showing that the IgG responses did not change in the study period following the exacerbation, and in particular that no IgG4 was induced, do not support the idea of a bystander regulation.",

            "text": "A striking and unexpected finding was however made showing that 60% of the children developed IgE antibody to P6 during convalescence, either increasing from pre\u2010existing titres or appearing from undetectable levels. This is therefore evidence for the possibility that Th2 cytokines produced during the exacerbation to direct an anti\u2010bacterial response to a Th2\u2010regulated antibody isotype. The presence of IgE antibodies to bacteria, including H. influenzae, has been known for some time [22, 23] but the quantitative assays used here reveal not only a very high frequency, but also the antibody levels can be of considerable magnitude. A number of the children developed titres of 5\u201315 ng of IgE/mL, which raises the possibility that the IgE interacting with the bacterial antigen may even have an effect on prolonging the inflammation. For comparison, the median anti\u2010Fel d 1 IgE titre for people with rhinoconjunctivitis to cats is 6 ng/mL [24, 25]. The anti\u2010P6 titres even reach the level of the responses to the major HDM allergens of about 50% of the HDM\u2010sensitized children in this study and 40% of those measured by Trombone et al. [26]. The bacteria are usually present in concentrations of over 103/mL of aspirate [27] so there is reasonable scope for antigen\u2013antibody interactions. Similar responses to other colonizing bacteria must also be considered. It is unlikely that the IgE had a direct role in the exacerbation because the titres were low at that time and it is a matter for speculation as to whether or not the up\u2010regulation required increased exposure to antigen from a recrudescence of an existing infection or a new colonization.",

The effect of corticosteroids depends on the differentiation state of the target cells that are controlling or limited the responses [29]. Steroids for example inhibit early B\u2010cell responses and increase later immunoglobulin switching. The results here are reminiscent of those reported by Diaz\u2010Sanchez et al. [30] showing that steroids markedly inhibited the mucosal IgE antibody response of patients challenged with ragweed allergen but at the same time only had a marginal effect on the adjuvant activity of the extract as measured by the increase in total IgE immunoglobulin. The present data are similar in that the anti\u2010allergen response was inhibited to a much greater degree than the IgE immunoglobulin titres and antibodies to the bystander antigen increased.",

It induces antibody responses in children during successive colonizations by predominately non\u2010typable organisms, which, as shown by recent studies, can be expected to occur several times a year [27]. The study environment has had universal HIB vaccination since 1993 with an almost complete eradication of type b disease and excellent compliance with the programme [31] so HIB infection or vaccination would not have influenced the anti\u2010P6 results shown here. Moreover, although not studied in Australia, HIB vaccination was shown to almost eliminate the ability to detect type b carriage in England, a country with a similar socio\u2010economic environment [32].",

These would contain the P6 antigen [35] and could be distributed into the airways. Localized IgE\u2010mediated inflammatory responses also can have systemic effects. As an example this has been demonstrated for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine that can be induced by Fc\u025bRI\u2010dependent responses of mast cells [36]. It was suggested from the study of Astrakhan that TSLP derived from a local site might impair tolerogenic B\u2010cell responses and promote allergic responses to new specificities [37]. The anti\u2010bacterial IgE produced during convalescence seems to stem from the exacerbation itself because it is produced in children regardless of their clinical history or evidence for a viral infection. Low IgG1 anti\u2010P6 titres were found in subjects with frequent and persistent asthma and were low at presentation and after convalescence so they should be investigated for a role in susceptibility to asthma and as markers for defining susceptible children.",
