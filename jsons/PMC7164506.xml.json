Keywords used to identify diseases and technologies included, but were not limited to, the following terms: medical devices, low-cost design, global health, low-income countries, low- and middle-income countries, point-of-care diagnostics, neglected tropical diseases (NTD), neonatal mortality. The names of specific health challenges in conjunction with other keywords were also used in the search. Identified conditions were compared based upon the number of affected people, disability adjusted life years, and current research carried out to address the condition. The diseases chosen for this review are melioidosis and neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis. These two diseases combined affect over 500,000 people in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1]. This is a fraction of the number of people affected by mosquito-borne diseases [2], but still presents a significant healthcare burden on developing economies. In contrast to, for example, malaria or HIV, these diseases have not received notable attention nor the development of technological solutions toward their treatment. One of the key aims of this review is to expose this unmet need. A section of this review focuses on neonatal mortality, which accounts for over 4 \u00d7 106 deaths worldwide and is a significant economic burden due to the number of productive years of life lost [3]. Finally, a section on policy and implementation is provided to aid researchers in identifying useful areas of study.",

            "text": "Although healthcare facilities have seen significant improvements over the past few years, reports suggest that diagnosis of melioidosis is only possible in large regional referral centers. This could lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment, and an underestimate of the number of people infected with the disease [6]. Diagnosis of melioidosis can be complicated by the presenting symptoms and their similarity to tuberculosis: abscesses in the lungs, liver, spleen, and brain stem encephalitis. The bacterium typically infects the host by inoculation onto the skin, by inhalation, or by ingestion. Inoculation onto the skin can cause subcutaneous abscesses, inhalation can cause pneumonia, and the bacterium can reach internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and the lungs through the blood. The most common presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, with over 50% of cases either occurring through lung abscess or due to septicemic spread. An additional challenge with melioidosis is that the bacteria, B. Pseudo-mallei, is a difficult organism to kill, with studies showing that it is capable of surviving in triple distilled water for years [7]. The disease primarily occurs during the rainy season [8] and people who are in direct contact with wet soil are most vulnerable to the disease. Predispositions such as diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and alcoholism, or those who are immunosuppressed increase the risk of contracting the bacterium [9]. Over 50% of patients diagnosed with melioidosis already have diabetes mellitus as a predisposition [10]. This presents a major problem for south Asian countries as the number of patients living with diabetes as an underlying condition is projected to increase by 70% between 2010 and 2030 [11]. An additional risk factor is the age group for contracting diabetes mellitus in these countries is 40\u201360, with reports showing that incidence of melioidosis peaking in this age group, and most countries of this region exhibiting aging demographics.",

            "text": "The recommended treatment of melioidosis involves the intravenous injection of the antibiotic ceftazidime for at least 10 days [12]. The therapeutic response to the drug is slow and physicians tend to prematurely switch antibiotics in a considerable number of cases, with the assumption that the bacterium has developed antibiotic resistance. The mortality for a 2-week administration of the drug is 18% [10]. Although there have been developments over the past 30 years with multiple clinical trials [13\u201315] in treating melioidosis, the cost of the antibiotics is still high (from US$70\u2013$150 a day [16]), imposing a significant economic burden on developing countries. Simpson et al. [17] comment on the price of drug regimens used to treat the disease and cite lack of financial support from pharmaceutical companies for diseases prevalent in rural areas as one of the challenges in developing treatment and diagnostic solutions. Melioidosis has been described as \u201cthe great imitator\u201d of other tropical diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis [18]. The varying clinical manifestations of the disease and the multiple affected organs often lead to an incorrect diagnosis. Delayed identification results in the administration of antibiotics that are usually unsuitable to treat melioidosis, which has led to high mortality rates as indicated by multiple studies [18,19]. It is critical that rapid diagnostic solutions are developed to reduce mortality rates. The most widely used method to detect B. Pseudo-mallei is culturing in a modified Ashdown medium with colistin [20], but even this technique may yield inaccurate results, especially in nonendemic areas where the clinical suspicion is low. In cases where there is a positive culture, it may be difficult for commercial systems to differentiate between B. Pseudo-mallei and phenotypically similar species such as Burkholderia thailandensis [21]. Recent reports highlight not only the limitations of bacterial gene amplification and detection but also the development of new screening and amplification techniques [22]. Since the sequencing of the complete genome of B. Pseudo-mallei [23], several quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed to identify the species [24]. However, it is still a challenge to identify primers that can differentiate B. Pseudo-mallei from closely related species.",

Surface acoustic wave-based atomization has been proposed to simplify the sample extraction and filtration process [29]. High-frequency surface acoustic wave-based atomization was used for the formation of micrometer scale droplets of cell lysate, and the purification step was achieved by loading the sample on a porous membrane placed in the direction of propagation of the surface acoustic waves.",

The neurological effects are due to its inhibitory impact on stimulated neurotransmitter release [42,43]. At high doses, lead can inhibit myelin formation and compromises the integrity of the blood brain barrier. Children are more sensitive to lead than adults due to increased hand-to-mouth activity and increased absorption in the gut. The acceptable thresholds for lead in blood have drastically changed since the 1960s in the United States, from 60 \u03bcg/dl to essentially recognizing that there is no safe level of lead exposure, with amounts under 5 \u03bcg/dl having been shown to adversely impact learning [44]. Significant reduction in lead exposure in the United States has been achieved by eliminating lead in gasoline and paint, but lead contamination of water remains a problem without a commensurate level of attention [45]. The decision in 2014 by the city of Flint to change its primary source of water saw lead levels in water rise to as much as 1000 \u03bcg/dl in some cases [46], with lasting healthcare implications. The only medical treatment for lead exposure is chelation [47], but chelating drugs may not be available in LMIC and in lower income regions of even wealthy countries. In any case, they are not very useful to treat chronic exposure.",

Increasing agricultural yield has been possible, in part, by the increased use of pesticides. The food and agriculture organization of the United Nations defines pesticides as growth regulators and includes substances that can prevent harm to crop during or after harvest [50]. Exposure to pesticides may occur through direct means through occupational exposure or via indirect means through drinking water, dust and food. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3 \u00d7 106 severe pesticide poisonings occur annually and that at least 300,000 people die as a result of exposure, with 99% of these cases being from LMICs [51]. The effects of pesticide exposure are wide ranging: chronic diseases such as cancer and developmental disorders [52], immunosuppression, hormone disruption, diminished intelligence, and reproductive abnormalities [53]. Of the various classes of pesticides in use today, organophosphate pesticides have been shown to cause substantial morbidity and mortality [54] but still account for over 25% of fertilizer produced [55,56]. Organophosphates are readily absorbed through the skin, and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. The mechanism of action is by inhibition of acetylcholnesterase, which promotes the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine [57]. Overstimulation of nerves due to excess acetylcholine results in autonomic dysfunction, involuntary motor movements, and respiratory depression. Long-term exposure has been shown to result in carcinogenicity [58]. Many farmers in developing countries are exposed to pesticides due to unsafe storage and handling practices, a lack of protective equipment during spraying, or chronic exposure to contaminated soil and water. Although there have been attempts to implement safe handling practices [59] and reduce pesticide use, there is a need to develop protective equipment that can be deployed in developing countries to prevent exposure alongside devices that can detect the presence of harmful pesticides in the local environment.",

            "text": "There is furthermore a need to monitor the presence of heavy metals and organophosphates in water supplies and in soil, particularly in regions of significant industrial or agricultural output. Paper-based microfluidics was first reported by George Whitesides' group [60] and has the advantage of being inexpensive, readily available, and can wick biological fluids without active pumping. A recent point-of-care paper diagnostic assay for the detection of lead and mercury in water was developed by Lewis et al. [61]. The device consists of hydrophobic regions that define where the fluid travels through capillary action. The assay is designed in such a way that the time taken for the fluid to travel from one part of the chip to another is indicative of the concentration of the analyte. This is accomplished by the use of glucose oxidase or streptavidin, which inhibit flow depending on analyte concentration. It has not been determined if time-based assays provide quantitative results for a range of users. More sensitive tests to detect the presence of lead in drinking water have been developed, with one group reporting a fourfold increase in sensitivity over conventional lateral flow assays [62]. The increased sensitivity was achieved by conjugating gold nanoparticles to a lead-specific monoclonal antibody (Anti-Pb(II)-ITCBE). Organophosphate detection schemes have been considered due to their historical use as chemical warfare agents [63], though there has been a lack of development in the detection of trace amounts of organophosphates, despite knowledge they pose a significant health risk.",

            "text": "As of 2005, about 4 \u00d7 106 babies die in the neonatal period (the first 4 weeks of life) and a similar number of babies are stillborn [64]. A majority of these deaths are in low-income and middle-income countries in Africa and southeast Asia [65] as illustrated in Fig. 1. Some estimates show that 38% of all deaths in children under the age of five occur within the first month of life [65]. Assessment of the cause of death is difficult due to a lack of data collection in LMICs, but estimates indicate that complications arising from asphyxia, severe infections, and preterm births are the main causes of death [64]. The WHO defines birth asphyxia as the clinical description of a newborn that fails to initiate or maintain regular breathing at birth [68]. This term applies to a clinical condition and is not a specific cause of death. Advanced resuscitation is needed for less than 1% of babies at birth and babies that typically require advanced resuscitation by intubation typically require a neonatal intensive care unit to recover [69,70]. These are typically not available in regional hospitals in LMICs. Basic resuscitation, however, which only requires bag- and mask-type ventilators, is easy to implement for cases where intrapartum breathing assistance is required. Published guidelines vary on when to provide resuscitation [71], but the WHO recommends resuscitation in cases where the baby does not cry, breathe at all, or is gasping for 30 s [68]. It is crucial that these guidelines become widely known, as there is potential for adverse effects such as upper airway damage if respiratory support is provided to healthy babies [72]. Existing devices in use in low-resource settings include mucus extractors with one-way valves and rubber bulb suction devices. The key downside of these devices is that they present an infection hazard for both the neonate and the healthcare provider [73], alongside the potential risk of hypothermia in prolonged resuscitation of a neonate [74,75], and asphyxia. However, asphyxia may be overcome with expanded care and improved healthcare provider training, but it is crucial that clear protocols for resuscitation be established first.",

One of the most common abnormalities in neonates is spina bifida, which results from the failure of fusion of the caudal neural tube. A large percentage of cases can be prevented by folic acid supplementation as long as the condition is diagnosed [76]. The underlying cause of the condition is not known but it has been established that women with pregestational diabetes or a high body mass index are at an increased risk of having a child with spina bifida. The protein \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound can each be used to identify fetuses that have the condition [77]. Point-of-care testing of AFP would enable screening and potential early detection of spina bifida and allow the patient to seek further medical care in a primary setting. The typical values in maternal serum are under 100 ng/ml until 13\u201318 weeks of gestation [78]. A quantum-dot-based sensor for the detection of AFP has been reported by Yang et al. [79], with sensitivities to 1 ng/ml. This test, however, relies on comparing the relative fluorescence intensities of the sample with a control, and can be difficult to interpret in the absence of optics and skilled personnel. The WHO compendium of medical devices and technologies for low-resource settings lists two ultrasound scanners, which are priced at US$24,000 and US$7,500 [80], still a significant cost in comparison to the annual budget of many hospitals in low-resource settings [81].",

The problem with this procedure irrespective of the setting\u2014whether in an LMIC or a high-income country\u2014is that implanted shunts fail due to an obstruction caused by glial and inflammatory cells [82]. A comparison between an inexpensive shunt developed and used in Africa and one currently in use in the United States to treat the condition showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes [83]. The failure rate in the first 2 years for implanted ventriculoperitoneal shunts remains high, at over 40% [84], indicating that there is a need to evaluate failure due to occlusion in greater detail.",

Schistosoma haematobium is one of the leading causes for urinary tract infections, and around 150,000 deaths annually [91]. Schistosoma mansoni causes bowel ulceration and an estimated 130,000 deaths [92]. Adult male and female worms can live in the human host for an average of 10 years and the disease spreads by the transmission of eggs to an intermediate snail host typically found in water bodies. The worms feed on glucose present in blood and erythrocytes and excrete waste into the blood stream. Biomarkers present in waste may serve as a target for detecting schistosomiasis. The primary treatment for the disease is the drug praziquantel, which is only effective against mature worms [93]. Prolonged treatment for 3\u20136 weeks is required to completely cure the disease. Although this drug is being employed in the field to treat schistosomiasis, the mechanism of action is still unknown and side effects include abdominal pain and passage of blood in the stool [94]. The current diagnostic standard for schistosomiasis is the presence of viable eggs in urine or fecal matter, but the test has a low sensitivity [95]. The three recommended detection techniques by the WHO are microscopy, a urine-based dipstick assay [96], and the Kato\u2013Katz fecal examination [97]. The Kato\u2013Katz method was developed in the 1970s and uses a cardboard cutout over a glass slide and microscopy to easily count the number of eggs in a sample and quantify the number of eggs per unit weight but this technique, like the others recommended by the WHO, lack sensitivity.",

Recent reports on diagnosis of the disease have called for better diagnostic tools [99], one of which is PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. This group made use of glucose intake of the worms in vivo to detect and quantify their presence using a PET scanner. With groups starting to develop handheld PET scanners [100], this might present a novel research direction for groups looking to develop diagnostic technologies. PCR-based techniques have also been developed to analyze cell-free parasite deoxyribonucleic acid in human plasma [101], and the development of microfluidic PCR-based systems [102] for schistosomiasis could lead to improved detection.",

In the context of the conditions presented in this paper, there is a need to develop an effective way to screen for schistosomiasis and melioidosis. The spread of melioidosis starts through soil in the rainy season and the presence of schistosomiasis can easily be detected in fecal matter. A technique to purify samples coupled with existing point-of-care diagnostics would stop the spread of the disease at the source. This can be extended to detect the presence of environmental contaminants such as organophosphates and heavy metals. An increase in sensitivity can be achieved if adequate processing is done prior to point-of-care diagnosis. The UN's fourth millennium development goal called for a two-third reduction in neonatal mortality by 2015. Although there has been significant progress toward this goal, there are still 4 \u00d7 106 neonatal deaths every year, predominantly in south Asia and Africa. Developing medical devices specifically for neonatal care and not having to repurpose devices made for adults would enable easier surgical procedures. Better detection schemes for diseases such as spina bifida or hydrocephalus using low-cost ultrasound transducers would prepare doctors better for surgery. It is critical to rethink what low-cost means for such applications, especially considering the annual budget of hospitals in LMIC's. Frugal technologies that can be used repeatedly can withstand environmental conditions and can be used easily by healthcare workers in target countries should be prioritized.",
