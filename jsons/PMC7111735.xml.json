            "text": "Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a type member of the Tobamovirus group, is one of the well-characterized plant viruses. In infected tobacco, the viral coat protein (CP) may constitute up to 7% of the total host protein in quantity and can be easily purified from plant tissue in the form of viral particles. TMV has been considered as a vector to express foreign proteins or short peptides in host plants due to its high replication efficiency and stability of virions in host plants. For expressing a short peptide, the coding sequence was fused in-frame to the CP coding sequence close to the C-terminus. The resulting recombinant CP subunits could function as the wild-type CP subunits in assembling viral genome to particles and the objective short peptides would be expressed on the surface of the particles (Lim et al., 2002, Bendahmane et al., 1999, Fitchen et al., 1995, Gilleland et al., 2000, Hamamoto et al., 1993, Koo et al., 1999, Staczek et al., 2000, Sugiyama et al., 1995, Takamatsu et al., 1990, Turpen et al., 1995). Such expressed short peptides were suggested to be useful for vaccine purpose, especially in stockbreeding, as the immunogenicity was highly enhanced when the CP subunit was injected into animals as an adjuvant (Bendahmane et al., 1999, Gilleland et al., 2000, Koo et al., 1999, Staczek et al., 2000, Wu et al., 2003).",

            "text": "However, unsuccessful expressions of certain short peptides by this strategy were often experienced: the corresponding recombinant TMV genomes became less infectious, and in some cases, they even induced local lesions on the inoculated leaves instead of the typical systematic mosaic symptoms seen on young leaves of the susceptible tobacco hosts such as Samsun nn and Xanthi nn (Bendahmane et al., 1999, Takamatsu et al., 1990). At present, little is known about the mechanisms that control the display of a foreign peptide on the surface of the recombinant TMV. It was ever proposed that the charge and isoelectric point of the recombinant CP subunit might play an important role in the successful display of a foreign peptide on the surface of TMV (Bendahmane et al., 1999). Here, we reported for the first time that a group of recombinant TMV genomes encoding short peptides with a transmembrane domain induced necrotic local lesions on susceptible tobacco N. tabacum Samsun nn and N. tabacum Xanthi nn while the transmembrane domain was adapted from various known proteins, such as the spike and membrane proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003), the sodium-phosphate coupled transporter protein DvSPT1 of Dunaliella viridis (Li et al., 2006) and the voltage-gated sodium channel protein Scn2a of rat (Noda et al., 1986). Interestingly, further analysis led us to conclude that among the reported CP subunits encoded by infectious TMV recombinants, none contained any transmembrane domains.",

Similar to that infected by wtTMV (Fig. 1\n), all the inoculated plants were infected, showing the typical mosaic symptoms (Fig. 1). The cDNA fragments specifying the fused S1241, M109 and M125 sequences could be amplified by RT-PCR analysis from young leaves of the corresponding infected tobacco plants (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 4, 6), which were confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). Abundant amount of the CP subunits of the three constructs accumulated in the young leaves similar to that of wtTMV (Fig. 2B, lane 2), which was shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, 6) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 4, 6).

Based on the symptoms on the susceptible tobacco plants, there were two groups of TMV recombinants: systemic infection-related and necrotic local lesion-related. The former includes those encoding the fused peptides F11, F14 and F14mu from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 protein (Wu et al., 2003), F25 and F20 from FMDV VP1 protein (Jiang et al., 2006), ZP3 from murine zona pellucida ZP3 protein (Fitchen et al., 1995), 9-14mer from Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein F (Gilleland et al., 2000, Staczek et al., 2000), G5.24 from rabies virus glycoprotein (Bendahmane et al., 1999), 5B19, 5B19L and RB19E from murine hepatitis virus (MHV) S-glycoprotein (Bendahmane et al., 1999, Koo et al., 1999), neuropeptide nocistatin mNST from bovine brain (Lim et al., 2002), ACEI inhibitor (Hamamoto et al., 1993), pep8 and pep18 from influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (Sugiyama et al., 1995), pep13 from human immunodeficiency virus type I envelop protein (Sugiyama et al., 1995), (QGPGAP)2 from malaria (Turpen et al., 1995) and peptides S1241, M109, M109mu and M125 from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike and membrane protein (Marra et al., 2003) studied in this paper.

However, predicted by the three programs, none of the above TMV recombinants contained any transmembrane domains in the corresponding CP subunit. This observation suggested that the TMV recombinants that caused typical systematic infections on susceptible tobacco plant contained no transmembrane domains in their recombinant CP subunits, however, to TMV recombinants that induced necrotic local lesions, a transmembrane domain in the recombinant CP subunits seemed not to be necessary.",

In this paper, we looked into, for the first time, a possible relationship between the transmembrane domain in the CP subunits and the induction of the local lesions on susceptible tobacco plants, and concluded that the transmembrane domain at the C-terminus of the recombinant CP subunit in the region of the fused foreign peptide would determine the corresponding TMV recombinant to induce the necrotic local lesion response on the inoculated leaves of Samsun nn tobacco plant as well as Xanthi nn tobacco (data not shown); we also concluded that none of the reported infectious TMV recombinants contained any transmembrane domains in the CP subunits. The transmembrane domains involved in this report were adapted from different proteins and organisms and shared no homologies in the sequences to each other (data not shown); however, all the corresponding TMV recombinants caused necrotic local lesions on the inoculated leaves of the Samsun nn and Xanthi nn (data not shown) tobacco plants.",
