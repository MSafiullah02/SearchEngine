            "text": "Without a coordination of the research teams in the whole country, potential participants could be scattered in numerous small studies, resulting in less powerful results or incomplete trials. There were only 3 international and 36 domestic collaboration studies, suggesting a low level of cooperation. The registrations showed that nearly half of the studies had not started recruiting by March 3rd, while the new cases in China were sharply reducing. Besides, a few of the sponsors had withdrawn their studies due to lack of patients. In fact, we could learn from the experience on study design of Ebola virus disease according to WHO documents. 25,31 For example, the adaptive trial designs were used in the Ebola epidemic, it has the capacity to yield meaningful and interpretable data quickly, while more complex to coordinate among different sites. The key points of study design in these documents may also helpful for the design and implementation of COVID-19 clinical trials.There are several limitations in our research. First, the registrations provide limited information on the trials, and our analysis is based on the registered information but not the full protocols. Second, the required information of the registrations are not unique across different registries, and the information could be revised by sponsors after the search and analysis, so the results may not include the whole registered information of the COVID-19 studies. Third, the number of registered trials is escalating quickly, as for April 29th, 632 and 997 studies were registered in ChiCTR and Clinicaltrials.gov, it is hard to trace the details of these information up-to-date, and our study mainly reflect the overview of the registered clinical studies in the early time of COVID-19 outbreak. Besides, the retrieving date was before the announcement of the global pandemic, so the studies were mainly from China.More international collaborations, rapid data sharing, and strengthened coordination are needed in the searching for effective therapy. As WHO suggested, enhancing global coordination of all relevant stakeholders, a clear and transparent global research and innovation priority setting and common platforms for standardized process are needed in the research during the outbreak.32 As reported, WHO and partners are launching SOLIDARITY trial and aims to generate robust data for the most effective treatment for COVID-19.3 Furthermore, rapid data sharing is warranted once they are adequately quality controlled for release.33  To response the outbreak of COVID-19, a quick upload of data is recommended when registered trials initiated so for immediate analysis and inform upcoming trials. In addition, the coordination of the trials are urgently needed. More rigorous regulations by the National Health Commission in China have been delivered for the clinical studies on COVID-19",
