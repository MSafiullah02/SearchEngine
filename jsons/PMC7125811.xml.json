            "text": "According to the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), influenza is categorized as an exogenous \u201cwarm disease\u201d or \u201cWen Bing\u201d(Koh, 2010). Wen Bing formulas have been used for more than 200 years since their publication in Wen Bing Tiao Bian by Wu Jutong in 1798. These formulas include Yin-Qiao-San (a formula made up by Fructus Forsythiae, Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, Platycodonis Radix, Menthae Haplocalycis Herba, Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae, Herba Schizonepetae, Sojae Semen Praeparatum, Fructus Arctii and Reed Rhizome) and Sang-Ju-Yin (a formula made up by Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Fructus Forsythiae, Menthae Haplocalycis Herba, Folium Mori, Chrysanthemi Flos, Platycodonis Radix, Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae and Reed Rhizome). Up to now, these two formulas are still the first line herb therapies for treatment and prevention of early-stage influenza in China as recommended by National Health Commission, PRC (National Health Commission, 2018). As for middle-stage influenza, the recommended formula is Ma-Xing-Shi-Gan-Tang, which is adapted from Shanghan Lun compiled by Zhang Zhongjing before year 220, at the end of the Han dynasty. This formula is made up by Ephedrae Herba, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus, Platycodonis Radix, Radix Scutellariae, Bupleuri Radix and Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae. Per the pattern differentiation of TCM, more herbs could be added to the original formulas for specific disease presentations. The TCM formula commonly used during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 in China is the Sang-Ju-Yin formula adjusted by adding Radix Isatidis, Radix Scutellariae and Radix Astragali (Fratkin, 2010).",

In collaboration with the HA, investigations of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between OS and HA recommended Chinese formula, namely CMF1 (a combined formula of Yin-Qiao-San and Sang-Ju-Yin) in both animal and human subjects were performed by our group since 2008 (Chang et al., 2014). To explore more, we would like to investigate the interactions between OS and selected single herbs from these Wen Bing formulas. Thus, eight herbs, namely Radix Isatidis (Chen et al., 2017), Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae (Michaelis et al., 2011; Sekine-Osajima et al., 2009; Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009), Radix Scutellariae (Xu et al., 2010), Fructus Forsythiae (Li et al., 2011), Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (Lu et al., 2018), Folium Mori (Savov et al., 2006), Herba Schizonepetae (He et al., 2013) and Fructus Arctii (Hayashi et al., 2010), were selected for further studies based on the flowing cariteria: (i) commonly used in traditional Wen Bing formulas and (ii) the efficacy of the selected herbs in China Pharmacopeaia clearly related to anti-influenza effects based on TCM and (iii) the selected herbs/their herbal components having antiviral effects on influenza virals in modern pharmacoligical studies. In addtion, ten relevant marker components in these eight herbs were also selected to help understand the interaction between OS and herbs: epigoitrin from Radix Isatidis; glycyrrhizic acid, liquirtin from Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae; baicalein, baicalein, wogonin from Radix Scutellariae; phillyrin from Fructus Forsythiae; chlorogenic acid from Flos Lonicerae Japonicae; rutin from Folium Mori and arctiin from Fructus Arctii.",

            "text": "OS is the ethyl ester prodrug of oseltamivir acid (OSA, Ro 64\u20130802), a potent and selective inhibitor of the neuraminidases glycoprotein essential for replication of influenza A and B viruses (He et al., 1999). It is currently marketed under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae (Roche), with approval for treatment of influenza in 1999, and for the prophylaxis of influenza in 2000 by U.S. FDA. In 2009, the outbreak of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1, commonly referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d, which caused fatal infection and over 17,700 deaths in over 213 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended Tamiflu for early treatment of swine flu. OS is orally well absorbed and metabolism to OSA by carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) in-vivo (He et al., 1999; Shi et al., 2006) without interaction with human cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase (He et al., 1999). OSA is an anion and has been proved to be the substrate of organic anion tublar secretion transporter (OAT) during its renal secretion (Deguchi et al., 2004). OS, not OSA, is a substrate of P glycoprotein (P-gp). Accordingly, low levels of P-gp activity or drug-drug interactions at P-gp may lead to enhanced brain accumulation of oseltamivir, and this may in turn account for the central nervous system effects of oseltamivir observed in some patients (Morimoto et al., 2008). A recent study suggested that oseltamivir is also a substrate of Peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) during its intestinal absorption (Ogihara et al., 2009).",

Comparing with drug-drug interactions of OS, reports on its herb-drug interactions are even fewer. Effects of herbal supplement and traditional medicines (including extracts from six traditional Cree botanicals, a commercially available Echinacea product, Goldenseal and a traditional Chinese medicine) on the in-vitro activity of human hepatic microsomal-mediated metabolism of OS have been evaluated by Liu et al. (2010). The findings suggested that there is a potential for health/herbal supplement used by patients in response to pandemic A/H1N1 to reduce efficacy of OS, however the potential clinical significance of such interaction was not studied. In addition to limited reports on the herb-drug interactions of OS at pharmacokinetics levels, it was found that the potential interaction could also be at the pharmacodynamics level. Pomegranate polyphenol extract has not only demonstrated its in-vitro inhibition on the replication of human influenza A/Hong Kong (H3N2), but has also shown a synergistic effect with OS (Haidari et al., 2009).",

Such screening platform will be based on available knowledge of absorption, disposition and antiviral activities of OS, and built with our existing models of in-vitro enzymatic reactions of liver microsomes, in-vitro transport using cell lines that over-expressed with P-gp, PEPT1 or OAT, and in-vitro plaque-reduction assay.",

Since transfected PEPT1 cells are not available, we used a PEPT1-inhibitor, Gly-Sar, to inhibit PEPT1 and to check if co-incubation with herbs/herbal components could decrease the uptake of OS. The inhibition results are shown in Fig. S5. When adding the inhibitor, the uptake amount of OS was significantly lowered.

On the contrary, the herbs (H1 to H7) and herbal components (C1, C3, C4) could increase the uptake of OS in Caco-2 cell.

As shown in Fig. 2 (left), the final model was a four compartmental PK model (two compartments for OS and OSA distribution, and another two to represent the reservoirs of OS and OSA in urine) with two absorption compartments (one for directly absorbed amount of OS and one for first-pass eliminated amount of OS). OS was absorbed from deposit compartment into the central compartment via a first-order process (k\na) and the disposition of OS and OSA could be described by a one-compartment model. The reported volume of distribution for OS and OSA in rats were 3.1 and 1.3 L/kg, respectively, with a ratio of 2.42 (equal to 3.1 divided by 1.3). Thus, in the final model the distribution volume of OS is V\nd and that of OSA is assumed to be V\nd/2.42. The formation of OSA from OS was either from first-pass metabolism or from the OS in the central compartment via CL\nm. To determine if co-administration with RS could lead to different structural parameters (k\na, CL\nm, V\nd, FP, BIO, k\ne,OS, k\ne,OSA), in the modeling development process, models with identical or different structural parameters among the three groups were tried and compared. Only when the dropped OFV is bigger than 3.84 (p < 0.05), these structural parameters were thought to be significantly different after co-administration with RS (Table 1\n). It was found that co-administration with RS had no effect on the absorption rate constant (k\na) and metabolic clearance (CL\nm) of OS, but would decrease V\nd and increase the remaining structural parameters (FP, BIO, k\ne,OS, k\ne,OSA). Inter-individual variability (IIV) were successfully estimated for parameters CL\nm, V\nd and k\na. However, for other structural parameters, IIV tend to be zero with a shrinkage close to 100%. In the error model, both additive and proportional errors were added to the observed values from plasma and urine, respectively. Due to the RSE of additive errors were high than 50%, the additive errors were fixed to be zero and only proportional errors were included in the final model. We also tried to use only one proportional error parameter for both plasma and urine data, but this led to an increased OFV of 8.2.",

Unexpectedly, we noticed different inhibition trends for C4 and C1 in microsomes and purified enzymes (hCE1) incubation studies. C4 showed the strongest inhibition of OS hydrolysis in rat plasma, but no inhibition in microsomes and hCE1 systems. Among the herbal components, herbal component C1 was the strongest inhibitor for OS hydrolysis in microsomes and hCE1 while in rat plasma it ranked behind C4, C6 and C10. The composition and enzymes in rat plasma are much more complex than those in microsomes and hCE1. Major esterases in plasma are butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), paraoxonase (PON), and carboxylesterase (CES) (Bahar et al., 2012). The most abundant plasma protein is albumin, which occasionally shows hydrolyzing activity. Esterified compounds are hydrolyzed by these major plasma proteins via different catalytic mechanisms. The hydrolase activities in rat plasma may be originated from more than one kind of enzymes (not only hCE1) and the inhibition activities of these herbal components to each kind of hydrolysis enzymes are different. More work will be performed to clarify the inhibition mechanism of each herbal component.",

Our current proposed method is to first convert the raw values of each experiment to fold change (FC) of their control groups and then normalize the FC values of each experiment with z-transformation to make the results with different nature comparable between experiments. Fold change is a measure describing how much a quantity changes going from an initial (control) to a final value and is often used in analysis of gene expression data in microarray and RNA-Seq experiments, for measuring change in the expression level of a gene (Tusher et al., 2001). In our experiments, FC could be considered as the contribution of herbs/herbal components in each experiment. The more FC is far from one (bigger or less than 1), the more likely the studied herbs/herbal components have an HDI with OS. However, FC still could not be compared between experiments due to varied FC ranges in each experiment. Inspired by multivariate statistical methods (Varmuza and Filzmoser, 2009), we chose z-transformation, a common normalization method, to normalize the FC values in each experiment to make them having the same distribution of N(0,1). After such a normalization, the absolute z-score of an herb/herbal component effect on OS would be proportional to its level of HDI relevancy with OS. Thus, the sum of all the absolute z-scores for each herb/herbal component in the six in-vitro experiments would be an indicator for their HDI potential.",

All oseltamivir groups (G1, G2 and G3) could significantly reduce the number of plaques for virus H1N1 and H3N2, but no addition effects were observed when co-administration of OS with RS extracts. The reason that interactions between OS and RS were only observed in pharmacokinetics not pharmacodynamics could be due to different time-points in our current PK and PD evaluations. For PK studies, plasma concentration data from 10 time-points were used, while only one time-point at 2.5 h after oseltamivir administration were used for the PD study.

Thus, the slow terminal phase of OS in Fig. 2 (right) would represent the absorption rather than elimination of OS. Therefore, the observed elimination phase of OS in G1 but not in G2 and G3 suggested that the elimination rate of OS is too fast to be captured after co-administration with RS.2)BIO (absorbed fraction) and FP (fraction that escaped first-pass metabolism) were successfully estimated with the urine PK data when the intravenous PK of OS for OS only (G1) and co-administration groups (G2 and G3) are not available. The assumption to use urine PK to estimate BIO is that all (or majority) of the absorbed OS would be collected in urine in the form of OS or its metabolite (OSA), which has already been verified in rats and human studies (He et al., 1999). The estimated BIO of OS after 5-days administration of OS in G1 is 23.6%, slightly lower than its reported oral bioavailability (35%) in rats after single dose of 10 mg/kg of OS (Li et al., 1998). Moreover, our current modeling method of integrating plasma and urine PK has an advantage of using less rats (no IV groups needed). As shown in Table 1, after co-administration with RS, BIO of OS increased by 62% without change in its absorption rate (k\na), which suggested that RS would increase the absorbed fraction of OS through inhibiting P-gp efflux as evidenced in section 3.2 rather than changing its permeability. Although RS could also increase FP by inhibiting hydrolysis of OS during its absorption process, its inhibition on systemic hydrolysis of OS is not significant (unchanged CL\nm) due to the relative small amount of absorbed RS components and the ubiquitous distribution of CES1 in rat plasma (Furihata et al., 2005).3)The developed pop-PK model lets us have an interpretation on the contradictory phenomena that co-administration of RS would increase both the elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) of OS in rats. This is mainly caused by the decreased volume of distribution (V\nd) of OS. Such changed V\nd may need further verification by collecting intravenous data for rats in G2 and G3.4)The pop-PK model could separately estimate the metabolic clearance (CL\nm) and renal clearance (k\ne,os*\nV\nd) of OS. The total body clearance of OS (CL\nm/0.25+ k\ne,os*\nV\nd/0.25) estimated by our model is 1.015 L/h/kg, which is comparable with the reported clearance of 1.8 L/h/kg after intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg OS in rats (Li et al., 1998). After co-administration with RS, renal clearance rather than metabolic clearance of OS increased by 48.5% (from 0.62 to 0.92 L/h/kg), suggesting that RS could accelerate the elimination of OS from body, which warrants further in-vivo verification by intravenous pharmacokinetics of OS after five days oral co-administrations of OS with RS.\n",
