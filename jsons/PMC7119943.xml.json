            "text": "The development of the rapid, immunochromatographic test strip, also known as lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), is the result of convergence of several threads that can be traced back to the 1950s. However, the concept of rapid diagnostic tests based on body fluids dated back significantly further. Documented evidence of saliva- and urine-based diagnostics existed several thousand years ago. The ancient Chinese were among the first documented users of saliva-based diagnostics. One widely used practice involved the use of saliva as a rapid determinant of guilt. In the \u201cRice Test\u201d, the inability to generate enough saliva to swallow a handful of rice was considered sufficient evidence for conviction. In this way, a rapid result was generated, but often with a poor prognosis for the subject. One of the earliest written records of a urine-based diagnostic test for pregnancy can be found in ancient Egyptian documents. There, a test was described whereby a potentially pregnant woman could urinate on wheat and barley seeds over the course of several days. The results: \u201cIf Barley grows, it means a male child. If wheat grows, it means a female child. If both do not grow, she will not bear at all\u201d [1]. The interest in urine as a rapid diagnostic medium for a variety of ailments continued through the Middle Ages, with the advent of the so-called piss-prophets in Europe, who claimed to be able to differentiate many different conditions from the color of urine. Along with many medical concepts of the time, success typically varied. Despite best efforts through the ages, it was not until the mid-twentieth century that the majority of rapid diagnostic methods gained real predictive value.",

In the same period, plate-based immunoassays were being developed. The first radio-immunoassay (RIA) was invented by Berson and Yalow in the 1950s [3]. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was introduced in the 1960s, bringing with it significant advantages, including the replacement of radioisotopes with enzymes, faster reaction times, higher specificities, and longer shelf-life than RIA. The basic principles of the lateral flow technology continued to be refined through the early 1980s and were firmly established during the latter years of that decade, with the filing of several major patents on this technology format by companies such as Becton Dickinson & Co. and Unilever and Carter Wallace [4\u20136]. Since then, at least another 500 patents have been filed on various aspects of the technology.",

            "text": "The main application driving the early development of the solid phase, rapid-test technology was the human pregnancy test, which represented continual historical interest in urine testing for medical diagnostic purposes. This particular testing application made great strides in the 1970s, as a result of improvements in antibody generation technologies and significant gains in understanding of the biology and detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), derived largely from the work performed by Vaitukaitis and co-workers [7]. However, to fully develop the lateral flow test platform, a variety of other enabling technologies were also required. These include technologies as diverse as nitrocellulose membrane manufacturing, antibody generation, fluid dispensing and processing equipment, as well as the evolution of a bank of knowledge in development and manufacturing methodologies. All of these elements were required to render a m\u00e9lange of complex chemicals, biologicals, papers, polymers, people, and processes into a simple and easy-to-use test, which is able to adequately perform to provide prognostic results in a variety of critical applications. Many of these facilitative technologies had evolved throughout the early 1990s, to the point where many are now mature, off-the-shelf technologies. As a result of the early work in all of these areas, the first lateral flow products were introduced to the market in the late 1980s. Since then, the technology, its applications, and the industry have all continued to evolve. As of 2006, over 200 companies worldwide are producing a range of testing formats, with a total value of approximately $2.1 billion dollars (USD) in major market segments (Stratcom, personal communication) (also see Chapter 2). The application of the technology has expanded well beyond clinical diagnostics to areas as diverse as veterinary, agriculture, biowarfare, food, environmental health and safety, industrial testing, as well as newer areas such as molecular diagnostics and theranostics.",

            "text": "Figure 1.1 shows the typical configuration of a lateral flow immunoassay. Traditionally designed assays are composed of a variety of materials, each serving one or more purposes. The parts overlap onto one another and are mounted on a backing card using a pressure-sensitive adhesive. The assay consists of several zones, typically constituted by segments made of different materials. These will be briefly explained here. When a test is run, sample is added to the proximal end of the strip, the sample pad. Here, the sample is treated to make it compatible with the rest of the test. The treated sample migrates through this region to the conjugate pad, where a particulate conjugate has been immobilized. The particle can typically be colloidal gold, or a colored, fluorescent, or paramagnetic monodisperse latex particle (see Chapter 5). This particle has been conjugated to one of the specific biological components of the assay, either antigen or antibody depending on the assay format (see Chapter 4). The sample re-mobilizes the dried conjugate, and the analyte in the sample interacts with the conjugate as both migrate into the next section of the strip, which is the reaction matrix. This reaction matrix is a porous membrane, onto which the other specific biological component of the assay has been immobilized. These are typically proteins, either antibody or antigen, which have been laid down in bands in specific areas of the membrane where they serve to capture the analyte and the conjugate as they migrate by the capture lines. Excess reagents move past the capture lines and are entrapped in the wick or absorbent pad. Results are interpreted on the reaction matrix as the presence or absence of lines of captured conjugate, read either by eye or using a reader. The assay formats can be either direct (sandwich, Fig. 1.2a) or competitive (inhibition, Fig. 1.2b) and should be able to accommodate qualitative, semi-quantitative, and, in limited cases, fully quantitative determinations. Direct assays are typically used when testing for larger analytes with multiple antigenic sites, such as hCG, Dengue antigen, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this case, a positive result is indicated by the presence of a test line. Less than an excess of sample analyte is desired, so that some of the conjugated particles will not be captured at the capture line, and will continue to flow toward the second line of immobilized antibodies, the control line. This control line typically comprises a species-specific anti-immunoglobulin antibody, specific for the antibody in the particulate conjugate. Competitive formats are typically used when testing for small molecules with single antigenic determinants, which cannot bind to two antibodies simultaneously. In this format, a positive result is indicated by the absence of a test line on the reaction matrix. A control line should still form, irrespective of the result on the test line.\n\n\n\n",

Nitrocellulose as a base material is hydrophobic, and is made hydrophilic by the addition of rewetting agents during the membrane production process. These rewetting agents are surfactants, and the type, amount used, and addition methods of surfactant differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and also from brand to brand within a manufacturer. These factors can affect the performance of the assay initially and over time. Not every protein is compatible with every surfactant. This is one reason for screening multiple membrane types during development. The flow characteristics of nitrocellulose membrane change over time, primarily due to desiccation of the membranes upon storage. Nitrocellulose membranes can be envisaged as a sponge, with the pores of the sponge being held open by water. If that water is removed, the pores collapse, disrupting the ability of the membrane to wick fluids through it. This results in changes and inconsistencies in flow rates over time. As speed directly affects assay sensitivity, extended run times can produce false positive results. This is a major contribution to the variability in lateral flow immunoassays.",

The protein-binding capacity of a membrane, its interactions with proteins, and the kinetics of the protein-binding process are the parameters that determine the appropriateness of a given set of proteins for the membrane and the sensitivity of the resulting diagnostic tests. Proteins bind to nitrocellulose through a combination of electrostatic, hydrogen, and hydrophobic forces. One of the key elements to the production of sensitive and reproducible assays is the consistent immobilization of immunologically active proteins to test and control lines. It is known that a majority of the proteins lose much of their immunological activity after binding passively to the membrane surface, due to their inability to bind covalently or directionally to nitrocellulose. The commonly accepted model for binding of protein to nitrocellulose is that proteins are initially attracted to the membrane surface by electrostatic attraction. Long-term bonding is then accomplished by a combination of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds. Many factors affect the binding process, and these must be considered when developing assays and processing nitrocellulose membranes. Some of these factors are listed below:(i)Reagent choices [9]Non-specific proteins: bulking proteins [e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein] compete for binding sitesMaterials that interfere with hydrogen bonding: Formamide and urea interfere with hydrogen bondingMaterials that interfere with hydrophobic interactions: Tween and Triton interfere with hydrophobic bondingPolymers such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) interfere with protein binding by a combination of these effects\n(ii)EnvironmentHumidity should be optimized for binding (25\u201350% relative humidity at room temperature)\n(iii)Processing MethodsDispensing methods: Contact tip versus non-contact will have effects on how protein binds or spreads through the membraneDrying methods: Forced air oven at elevated temperature versus ambient drying conditions.

These include deposition of test and control line proteins using quantitative dispensers, drying using forced air ovens at elevated temperature, and immersion processes for blocking. To lay down the test and control line proteins, the membrane is striped with proteins using either contact or non-contact dispensing systems, and is blocked thereafter to control and stabilize the flow-rates and hydration characteristics and to prevent non-specific binding. The dispensing method used for the test and control lines must be as quantitative as possible and should not vary with material hydration or absorption characteristics. Non-contact dispensing methods provide the best solution for quantitatively dispensing proteins onto nitrocellulose. The purpose of blocking a nitrocellulose membrane is to prevent the binding of proteins and labeled conjugate to the membrane at areas other than the test and control lines. Blocking also serves other functions, including maintenance of hydration of membranes, modification of wicking rates, and stabilization of test and control line proteins. Blocking is typically performed by immersion of the membranes in a solution containing proteins, surfactants, and polymers, and is a relatively uncontrolled process. The blocking method must be carefully controlled to produce optimal performance in the final product over its entire shelf-life. Drying is subsequently performed by a combination of blotting to remove surface fluids and with forced air at elevated temperatures to dry. Again, this drying process must be carefully optimized to minimize variation in the final product.",

Different nitrocellulose membranes can vary considerably in terms of performance characteristics when used with different proteins. Thus, a variety of suppliers and brands of nitrocellulose membranes are available. Performance of the membrane is typically defined by factors such as the polymer type used in the membrane, the pore size, the surfactant type, quantity, and the method of surfactant application. Pore sizes of the membrane used in lateral flow immunoassays range from a nominal 8 to 15 microns, although pore size is a non-exact descriptor in the case of nitrocellulose membranes. The polymeric structure does not actually create pores, but rather a tortuous sponge-like pathway for fluid and particle movement. \u201cWicking rate\u201d or \u201ccapillary rise time\u201d is a more appropriate measure of membrane flow characteristics than pore size. Capillary rise time is defined as the length of time required for a fluid front to traverse a 40 mm width of membrane and is a manufacturer-defined specification for nitrocellulose membranes. The choice of wicking rate is important to the kinetics and speed of development of the assay and will have critical effects on assay performance and sensitivity.",

In practice, variations in conjugate deposition, drying, and release from the membrane constitute major contributions to the coefficient of variation (CV) in assay performance. Assay sensitivity can also be adversely affected by poor conjugate mixing and release from the conjugate pad. Depending on the system, some may favor fast release while others favor slow release of the conjugate. However, the release must always be consistent. Because of the nature of the materials used, it is often necessary to pre-treat conjugate pads to ensure optimal release and stability. Pretreatment is performed by immersion of the pad in aqueous solutions of proteins, surfactants, and polymers, followed by drying. This process, similar to membrane dipping and drying described above, can be performed either in manual batch mode or in continuous inline mode, the latter giving the best opportunity for homogeneous processing of entire batches of materials.",

The most commonly used labels include colloidal gold and monodisperse latex, tagged with either a visual or a fluorescent dye (see Chapter 5). The labels can be covalently or passively coupled and can be read quantitatively.

Much of the burden of making those samples compatible with the rest of the assay system falls on the sample application pad. The role of the sample pad is to accept the sample, treat it such that it is compatible with the assay, and release the analyte with high efficiency. Sample treatments include the filtering out of particulates or red blood cells, changing the pH of the sample, actively binding sample components that can interfere with the assay, and disrupting matrix components, such as mucins, in order to release the analyte to the assay. The material chosen to fulfill any or all of these functions can have a great effect on assay performance due to the inhomogeneity of many available materials and the type of binders they contain.

In traditional, non-reader-based lateral flow immunoassays, the lamination process allows relatively large built-in tolerances in component overlaps and final line placement in a cassette. Variations in overlaps can result in variation in run quality of a strip, although in many less demanding applications this variation can be acceptable. In highly demanding applications, however, variations in run time and fluid front conformation can be fatal to the performance of the assay. This is particularly so in reader-based systems, where the evenness of line development across the entire width of the strip, the speed of running to completion, and the position of the developed line in the assembled cassette can all be absolutely critical to the success of the test. This places high demand in precision in the lamination, cutting, and cassette assembly processes. Automation is key to the success of these processes. The use of inline lamination equipment with camera systems, material edge sensing, as well as sensing in cutting and assembly, are all feasible approaches. Consideration should also be given to the tendency of the adhesive to flow into other components of the test strip, notably unbacked membranes, conjugate pads, and sample pads. This can cause disruption of flow patterns and the creation of hydrophobic patches, as well as destabilization of proteins. For this reason, medium, rather than high, tack adhesives are typically used. Care must be taken to choose adhesives that have a track record of being compatible with proteins during storage of the test strips.",

            "text": "The most commonly used particulate detector reagents in lateral flow systems are colloidal gold and monodisperse latex. Latex particles coupled with a variety of detector reagents, such as colored dyes, fluorescent dyes, and magnetic or paramagnetic components, are available commercially. Detailed discussions of these reagents can be found elsewhere in this book (see Chapter 5). The choice of the particulate label and the detector reagent used in a particular lateral flow system is driven by a variety of factors: i)Is covalent attachment of the protein to the particle required?If this is a requirement, then activated latex particles only can be used, as binding of proteins to colloidal gold is typically achieved via passive absorption.ii)Is the assay intended to be quantitative or qualitative? Is a reader required?The development of truly quantitative lateral flow immunoassays requires a great deal of effort in choosing the basic materials and technologies to be used. Some of these considerations will be discussed later in this chapter. In addition, the integration of readers into these assay systems will also be discussed. If the application requires a reader technology, then the choices of label expand to include colloidal gold, colored or fluorescent latex, and paramagnetic latex particles. The choice of particle and reading technology is driven by the consideration of the cost of the reader technology, the cost and availability of licensing of the readers and the labeling technology, the cost of assay development and reader integration, as well as the performance of the combined reading and labeling technology.iii)What are the levels of sensitivity required?In visually read assays, it is often possible to generate more sensitivity using colloidal gold rather than colored latex particles, due to the smaller size of the gold particles and, as a result, higher packing density can be achieved on a test line. Gold particles are typically in the range of 20\u201340 nm in size whereas colored latex particles are about 100\u2013300 \u00b5m. Gold also has a higher color intensity than colored latex particles, which allows for better discrimination of low positives in an assay. On the other hand, latexes can be produced in multiple colors and can utilize darker colors such as dark blue dyes to provide greater contrast against the white background of a lateral flow membrane. In reader-based assays, it is often possible to generate even higher sensitivity by using fluorescent particles or paramagnetic particles [10, 11].iv)Is the assay intended to be multiplexed? Is discrimination between multiple lines of different colors required?If these parameters are required, the choices are reduced to colored latex particles, which can be produced in multiple colors.v)What are the cost considerations in the manufacturing processes?There are several major suppliers of colloidal gold in the marketplace, such as British Biocell International (BBI, Cardiff) and Diagnostic Consulting Network (DCN, Carlsbad, CA). In general, purchasing colloidal gold is more economical than producing gold internally. It is possible to integrate the process of colloid gold production into the lateral flow immunoassay manufacturing process, and numerous companies have chosen to do this. However, when consistency of the product and the quality of the assay results are considered important, the overall goal to reduce any sources of variation in the assay often leads companies to contract with dedicated suppliers of high-quality components. There are also multiple sources of the monodisperse latex, most of which are considered to be of high quality, including Bangs Laboratories and Merck/Estapor. The manufacturing of monodisperse latexes is generally not integrated into a lateral flow immunoassay production process. As a result, companies relying on outside supply also have cost considerations.\n\n",

Process designs can be broadly categorized into two methods. In batch processing, card lengths of materials are processed individually, assembled into cards, and cut into strips. In in-line or reel-to-reel processing, all components are maintained in roll format until they have been treated and laminated, and only then are they cut into either individual strip or card lengths for final packaging.

This material fulfills all of the required functionalities of the components in the traditional lateral flow device, namely sample pad, conjugate pad, membrane, and wick. Because the material is non-protein binding, a traditional method of applying the test and control lines onto Fusion 5 is not possible. A strategy of laying down \u201cboulders in the stream\u201d is therefore applied [9]. Large-diameter beads (approximately 2 \u00b5m) are used to conjugate to specific proteins and are dispensed onto appropriate locations on the material, where the large-size beads become immobilized and form the test and control line areas. When the test samples and protein conjugates flow past the \u201cboulders\u201d, binding and signal formation occur at those locations. The open pore nature of this system means that assays can be run extremely fast, which have both positive and negative effects. Speed or reaction time can be important to LFIAs, but can also be related inversely to sensitivity in many instances. With Fusion 5, this is largely overcome due to the lower inherent background and the increased surface area for ligand binding provided by the beads.",

            "text": "For many applications, clinical and otherwise, traditional lateral flow formats and labels are capable of providing significant sensitivity. However, there is a growing trend in certain clinical applications, such as detection of cardiac markers, to attempt to achieve assay sensitivity that would previously have been considered beyond the ability of a point-of-need test to deliver. Other areas that require the same level of extreme sensitivity include biowarfare applications, such as anthrax detection, and food microbiology, where single-organism detection is the goal. Standard approaches of labeling and detection in lateral flow are unlikely to reach the required sensitivities for these applications. Instead, the industry must look to alternate labeling approaches, coupled with the use of reader systems. However, it must be noted that with diagnostic devices, the label and the reader are only part of the equation. The appealing feature of lateral flow and other point-of-need assay systems is that they provide a complete \u201csample-to-answer\u201d solution in a single step. Simply developing a high-sensitivity reader and labeling system is not enough. It is critical to consider the system as a whole, including the sample, the sampling method, the sample pretreatment methodology, and the concentration of analytes. Analyte concentration can be a confounding factor when it is either too high or too low for detection. There are also considerations of the affinity of the antibodies (see Chapter 4) and how their activities can be affected via the conjugation methods used during labeling procedures. These factors must also be considered when entering into a design program to create highly sensitive and highly reproducible assays. These concepts are illustrated by the following examples: i)High concentration of analyte: The high dose hook effect is a well-known phenomenon in assay development. For an immunoassay to give accurate results, there must be an excess of antibodies, both capture and label, relative to the analyte being detected. Only under conditions of antibody excess does the dose\u2013response curve show a positive slope and provide accurate quantitation. As the concentration of analyte begins to exceed the amount of antibody, the dose\u2013response curve will plateau. Further increase of analyte will cause the slope to become negative. Care must be taken in assay development to validate all potential sample types by dilutional linearity analysis to establish if they are on the positive slope region of the curve. The choice of label, conjugation method, and reading method will all have effects on the ability of the assay to handle large ranges of analyte concentrations. Sample pretreatment may in some cases be necessary to reduce analyte concentration prior to the assay to prevent hook effects.ii)Low concentration of analyte: Analytical methods are traditionally divided into several steps: sampling, preliminary operations, measurement, calculation, and evaluation of results [15]. Sampling refers to the generation of a representative sample of an inhomogeneous object [16]. This inhomogeneity presents a challenge to the success of the analytical method. A perfect example of the issues brought about by the quest for the ultimate sensitivity \u2013 single-molecule detection \u2013 was discussed in an interview with Graham Lidgard of Nanogen published in IVD Technologies in May 2006 [17]. Dr. Lidgard took the example of an assay that was developed by Tomas Hirschfeld of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM) [18] in which the researchers coupled a polymer of fluorescein to an antibody and directed a laser through a microscope into the sample. When the molecule passed under the laser, instant photobleaching occurred. The problem was that if there was only a single molecule in solution, it could take three months for this molecule to pass in front of the laser. Therefore, to generate results in a reasonable length of time, several hundred thousand molecules were required to be present in the solution. In a related paper [19], Chen et al. concluded that \u201cthe fluctuation in the number of molecules taken for chemical analysis is a fundamental and irreducible source of uncertainty\u2026. [and that] the inhomogeneity [of the sampled solution] presents a fundamental limit to analysis\u201d. This same uncertainty applies to the sampling of biological or other matrices for immunodiagnostic testing. As it applies to highly sensitive point-of-need assays, the moral of this tale is that it is not the absolute sensitivity of the system that is the most critical factor. Rather, it is the ability to acquire as representative a sample as possible, and ultimately, it is the concentration of the analyte detectable in the primary sample that is critical. Sampling and pretreatment methods are therefore critical in determining the availability of many analytes in an assay. If one takes 100 ml of a homogenized food sample and concentrates it into 100 \u00b5l for analysis, the assay system will have significantly more sensitivity than one that takes 100 \u00b5l of that primary sample without concentration and tests it. All the sensitivity benefits are there without ever changing a label or a detection method.iii)High incidence of cross contaminants in samples (see Chapter 10): Certain assays are well known for their high false positivity rates, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Chlamydia trachomatis. The Chlamydia assay, where high numbers of organisms are often present, does not require high sensitivity. Rather, it requires antibodies of high specificity. The TB assay has both sensitivity and specificity challenges. The sample pretreatment method, the antibody selection method, and the labeling and reading methods must be designed around these issues.\n",

Pressure for having device connectivity comes not only from multiple sources, including physicians themselves, but also from the US government and external industry sources.

In essence, that severely limits the throughput of the system. Depending on the application, high throughput may be more or less of an issue; but in applications such as clinical laboratories where tests may be batched before being run, this will be a critical issue.

The major suppliers of colloidal gold are Diagnostic Consulting Network (DCN) and British Biocell International (BBI). Dyed latexes and paramagnetic particles are available from a variety of sources including Bangs Laboratories, Dynal, Merck/Estapor, and Magsphere. There are also a variety of other labels and enhancement methods that are in development for use in point-of-need assays. One example is nanoparticles. Magnetic, latex, metal, and semiconductor particles on the nanometer scale have unique optical, electronic, and structural properties that can be used in a variety of clinical applications. However, the promised advances in performance based on nanotechnology have yet to materialize in the point-of-need industry. Numerous labeling technologies are in development, but it may yet be many years before some of these technologies produce improvements to existing labeling technologies in real-world applications. As yet, there are few examples of any of these labels in marketed point-of-need assays, particularly in lateral flow format. Examples of newer label technologies can be identified:i)Up-converting Phosphor Technology: STC Technologies, Inc. (Bethlehem, PA), now Orasure Technologies, developed the up-converting phosphor technology (UPT). UPT is based on lanthanide-containing submicrometer-sized ceramic particles that can absorb infrared light and emit visible light. They have the advantage that biological matrices do not up-convert. Additionally, the particles do not photobleach and are inert to common assay interferents such as hemoglobin. Orasure Technologies, Inc. developed a reader system based on these particles called the Uplink, and demonstrated its utility in example systems including one for E. coli O157: H7 [21]. The label has yet to achieve broad penetration in the market.ii)Quantum Dots: Quantum Dot Corporation (Palo Alto, CA), now owned by Invitrogen, originally commercialized the quantum dot (Qdot) nanocrystal technology developed at California\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Melbourne (Source: Stratcom). Qdots are 10\u201320 nm-sized crystals containing a few hundred to a few thousand atoms of cadmium mixed with selenium or tellurium, which have been coated with an additional semiconductor shell (zinc sulfide) to improve the optical properties of the material. The size of the nanocrystal determines the color of the excitation achieved when it is excited with a long-wavelength UV lamp. As a result, multiplexed assays can be created when conjugates of different sized particles are used as labels in the assay system and are excited using a single wavelength [22].iii)SERS Tags: Oxonica (Mountain View, CA) produces the Nanoplex biomarker detection system, which utilizes silica-coated, surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)-active metal nanoparticles as labels for bioconjugates. As with the QDot , the Nanoplex particles boast the ability to produce multiple excitation wavelengths from a single excitation frequency, allowing their use in multiplexed assays [23].\n",

            "text": "A number of strategies are available for the detection of nucleic acids in lateral flow systems [26\u201329]. The capture of nucleic acids can be performed in an antibody-dependent or antibody-independent way. For example, Piepenburg et al. [27] describe an antibody-dependent system, where an anti-biotin antibody immobilized on the surface of nitrocellulose is used to capture biotin and carboxyfluorescein (FAM) bearing oligonucleotides in RPA amplicons. Binding is subsequently detected using an anti-FAM-colloidal gold conjugate. An antibody-independent alternative utilizes streptavidin as the binding agent. Immobilization of oligonucleotide probes directly onto membranes is also possible using oligonucleotides linked to carrier proteins. Still another possible configuration is to use the \u201cboulders in the stream\u201d approach, where the oligonucleotides are immobilized onto the surface of large latex beads. The beads are subsequently dispensed onto the reaction matrix, forming the usual test and control lines. This methodology serves to vastly increase the available surface area for binding of analyte, thereby improving the sensitivity of the assay. In terms of detection on a NALF strip, the same labels can be employed as on a standard lateral flow immunoassay, including colloidal gold, colored, and fluorescent monodisperse latex particles. Similarly, the basic elements of the manufacturing and equipment can be readily applied to nucleic acid lateral flow. However, simply applying the basics as currently practiced will also mean applying many of the sources of variation and limitation of the lateral flow technologies. Rational improvements to the basic technologies will be key to unlocking the full potential of this assay format in nucleic acid applications.",

            "text": "The link between proteomics and diagnostics is a logical and potentially critical one. A clear need exists for new diagnostic targets for such pathologies as ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is hoped that proteomics will be able to identify such targets. Even though current commercial activities in proteomics are focused on developing analytical technologies, there have been increasing efforts to develop clinical applications as well [30]. An example of the successful use of proteomics coupled with diagnostic tools was illustrated in a paper by Drydna et al. [31]. Using 2D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, these researchers identified a protein that could differentiate between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. An ELISA was subsequently developed for clinical use based on this marker. An important aspect of this work is that it also provided a potential means for monitoring therapy, thereby linking the theranostics concept. By isolating chronic disease markers that are subjected to the influence of therapeutic drugs, the entire loop of discovery, diagnostics, therapeutics, and monitoring is utilized. In this scheme, self-monitoring or doctors\u2019 office monitoring of therapy using rapid assays makes sense on many levels. This is especially so if point-of-need assays can be made to be quantitative and reproducible. The outcome will likely require the utilization of reader and data recording strategies discussed earlier in this chapter. Another example of appropriate application of this strategy is in cardiac diseases. There is currently an active search for coagulation and lipid metabolism proteins that will help improve cardiac risk assessment. In 2005, the world market for these enzyme and protein markers was $20 million. Most assays are developed for specific drug discovery projects and have not been commercialized on a large scale. Between 2005 and 2010, these tests will gain importance and it is predicted that by 2010 this market segment should grow to $40 million (Source: Stratcom).",

In instances where pathologies may have resulted from changes in several proteins, either generative or consequential, diagnostic strategies will require multiplexing and subsequent analysis using algorithms in a process known as profiling [32]. For these applications, lateral flow type assays may not be appropriate as multiplexed systems such as microarrays are more likely to be utilized. However, for simpler systems that rely on the detection of only a single or relatively few proteins, rapid assays based on lateral flow principles may be applied.",

The world is somewhat arbitrarily divided into First, Second, and Third Worlds, and population, disease states, and diagnostic applications tend to be broadly considered along those lines. This classification ignores the heterogeneity of population and conditions present within each of those arbitrary boundaries. Cardiac and other chronic diseases in the expanding middle classes of emerging economies are growing, as are the incidences of previously geographically limited infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue), emerging diseases (e.g., H5N1 Influenza), and heretofore well-controlled diseases (e.g., TB in First World Countries) in developed countries. Twenty well-known diseases (e.g., cholera, malaria, TB) have reemerged or spread geographically since 1973, often in more virulent and drug-resistant forms. At least 30 previously unknown disease agents have been identified since 1973, including HIV, Ebola, hepatitis C, and SARS (Source: Stratcom). As a result of this globalization of disease states, one of the most critical issues for diagnostic companies is the development of appropriate distribution and sales strategies in worldwide markets, as well as the navigation of local regulatory and legal conditions. In chronic diseases, there remains significant growth particularly in the areas of inflammation, cardiac markers, and cancer, with a myriad of new labels in development in the search for improved diagnostic and prognostic indicators.",
