            "text": ". The strains isolated during the initial outbreaks in the United States were classified as highly pathogenic. In 2014, a strain with low pathogenicity was found in Ohio, USA; it was known as Indel-S because it has three nucleotide deletions and one insertion in the S gene, similar to the classic CV777 strain (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014) . Thus, the circulation of two great strain groups was established: the Indel-S type and the non-Indel-S type (Lee, 2015) . Indel-S-type strains have been found in several countries where the disease is endemic; however, they have been described as highly pathogenic strains (Stadler et al., 2015) . The circulation of Indel-S and non-Indel-S strains was recently described in Mexico, reporting PEDv prevalence levels of 30% (OIE, 2014) and 88.8% (Lara-Romero et al., 2017) . Previous reports on porcine epidemic diarrhoea in other countries suggest that the high genetic diversity of the circulating strains could produce emerging strains not yet identified in Mexico. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report the genetic variability of PEDv in samples from farms that showed high-mortality diarrhoeic outbreaks in piglets.",

The sequencing reaction was carried out on an Ion 314 Chip v2 and with the Ion PGM\u2122 Hi-Q\u2122 Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies). cDNA was physically fragmented with a Bioruptor \u00ae Sonication System (Diagenode) until fragments of 200 base pairs (bp) were obtained. Adapters were ligated to these fragments, the ends were repaired, and DNA was purified. DNA quantity, quality and integrity were evaluated using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). A library template was obtained using the Ion PGM\u2122 Hi-Q\u2122 OT2 Kit (Life Technologies) by emulsion PCR in the Ion OneTouch\u2122 2 System. Readings were filtered with the FastQC plug-in v3.4.1.1, selecting only those with a Q score \u2265 20 (6,074,916 reads); the depth was higher than 300\u00d7.",

The PEDv S gene was amplified by endpoint RT-PCR, yielding 28 positive samples (52.83%) from 10 of the 17 states sampled. This study reports the presence of the PEDv S gene in the states of Hidalgo, Oaxaca and San Luis Potos\u00ed for the first time (Lara-Romero et al., 2017; OIE, 2014). The coronavirus S protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein that interacts with cell receptors during virus entry (Weiss & Leibowitz, 2011). Various genotypes of the S protein gene have been described based on their genetic traits and the period when the strains emerged: GIa (classical), GIb (emergent, Indel-S), GIIa (emergent, non-Indel-S from the Americas) and GIIb (emergent, non-Indel-S from Asia) (Jarvis et al., 2016; Lee, 2015). Previous studies in Mexico have identified circulating strains with a GII genotype (from the Americas) as well as strains with a GI genotype (Indel-S) (Lara-Romero et al., 2017). The 20 strains isolated in this study (Table 1) are in the GIIa genotype branch and were identified as emerging, non-Indel-S variants (Figure 2); the strains PEDv/MEX/JAL/LI-DMZC11/2015 and PEDv/MEX/MICH/ LI-DMZC19/2015 are located in a cluster related to emerging strains from Asia, and all other strains are in clusters along with strains from the Americas (Jarvis et al., 2016; Lee, 2015), indicating that a wide range of strains are circulating in Mexico. The similarity rates for the S gene among classical and emerging virus strains ranged from 96% to 98%. Within the cluster of US strains, the similarity rate is even higher (99.3%-99.6%) than among emerging strains from China (98.1%-99.5%) (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016). Our results indicate a similarity rate of 99.3%-99.9% among Mexican strains with respect to emerging, non-Indel-S strains. The strains reported in this study showed a similarity rate of 95%-95.9% with emerging Indel-S strains and of 92.7%-93.2% with classical reference strains. The neutralizing epitopes on the S protein are SS2 (amino acid position 748-755), SS6 (amino acid position 764-771) (Sun et al., 2008) and 2C10 (amino acid position 1368-1374) (Cruz, Kim, & Shin, 2006). In this study, the reference strain USA/ 2013 was chosen for comparison because it showed a higher similarity rate with the GIIa genotype (Figure 3). Sequencing analysis revealed the positions of the epitopes 751 YSNIGVCK 758 , 767 SQSGQVKI 774 and 1371 GPRLQPY 1377 (SS2, SS6 and 2C10, respectively). No changes were observed in the epitopes SS2 and 2C10 in any of the 20 strains analysed, while a strain from Puebla isolated in 2014 (PEDv/MEX/PUE/LI-DMZC5/2014) showed an L/ S 767 F substitution on the SS6 epitope, a position previously described with different mutations in other strains (Hao, Xue, He, Wang, & Cao, 2014). The 2-amino acid insertion 537 SQ 538 was identified herein in the COE region in the strain PEDv/MEX/QRO/LI-DMZC49/2016; this insertion could give the S protein a different biological activity. Recently, 11 substitutions were found in 7 different Mexican strains (Lara-Romero et al., 2017); one of these substitutions (H 524 R) was found in a strain from Sonora. In this work, amino acid substitutions were found in strains from Puebla, Veracruz and",
