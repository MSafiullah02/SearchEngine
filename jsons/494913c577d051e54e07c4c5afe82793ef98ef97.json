            "text": "Systemic arterial hypertension (referred to as hypertension herein) is a major risk factor of mortality worldwide, and its importance is further emphasized in the context of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection referred to as COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension. Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension. This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury. We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk. This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues. In summary, a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of RAS blockers in COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there is currently no reason to discontinue RAS blockers in stable patients facing the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently referred to as COVID- 19. 1 On 11 March 2020, i.e. only 2 months later, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. 1 At the time of writing this review, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is constantly increasing and it is only a matter of days until the 1 million mark is exceeded. 2 The report of an apparently high prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (referred to as hypertension herein) in severe COVID-19 cases in an initial Chinese report on one hand, 3 and the concept that SARS-CoV-2 may use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-an enzyme potentially up-regulated by blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 4 -as a viral entry receptor in lung cells on the other hand 5, 6 has raised concerns. Indeed, given the high prevalence of hypertension in the population and the high percentage of patients receiving RAS blockers worldwide, it was speculated that these factors could contribute to the dissemination of COVID-19 and also complicate the course of the infection. Despite reassuring, consistent statements of several Hypertension Societies/Councils including the European Society of Hypertension, 7 the European Society of Cardiology Hypertension Council, 8 the International Society of Hypertension, 9 and the World Hypertension League, 10 the concern remained, as evident from subsequent reports in medical journals, social media, and the press. The scope of this article is to provide a rapid assessment and critical review of the relationship of hypertension, the RAS, and the risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and lung injury in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

According to a Spanish population-based study, the incidence of CAP showed a marked increase with age, but hypertension had no significant impact on the incidence of CAP. 12 In a population-based study investigating the risk of pneumonia in subjects older than 60 years in Finland, hypertension was the most common comorbidity (36.4%), followed by heart diseases and diabetes. 13 Importantly, the study indicated that age, lifestyle factors, e.g. high alcohol intake, and comorbidities including heart disease and diabetes, but not hypertension, were independently associated with increased risk of pneumonia. 13 To date, several of the available studies have shown that LRTIs are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, including acute coronary syndromes and arrhythmias. [14] [15] [16] Hypertension, among other factors of higher baseline cardiovascular risk including older age and heart failure, may represent an important risk factor for cardiac complications in this setting.",

It is unclear whether the methodology of the studies, environmental and genetic factors, or differences in clinical management contributed to these findings. 17 Subsequently, use of ACEIs and ARBs was associated with a lower incidence of CAP compared with calcium channel blockers in a Canadian cohort of new users of antihypertensive drugs. 18 In addition, ACEIs and ARBs have been also previously linked to reduced mortality in patients with CAP 19 and a reduced risk for CAP requiring hospitalization. 20 In summary, available studies do not provide sound evidence that hypertension is an independent risk factor for LRTI/CAP. However, they indicate that hypertension contributes to the increased occurrence of incident cardiovascular events in these patients, in agreement with the well-established risk associated with hypertension. 21, 22 If anything, the use of ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with a lower incidence of pneumonia and improved outcome in patients with LRTI/CAP. This also applies to viral pneumonia, in which RAS blockers have been associated with improved pneumonia-related outcomes. 23, 24 Is hypertension associated with COVID-19 infections?",

However, 81% of these deceased patients were older than 60 years of age 27 and thus in agreement with the corresponding age group in the overall elderly population. 26 Hypertension may also represent a proxy for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertensionmediated target organ damage, or cardiovascular complications, 28 all of which show an increasing prevalence with age. Thus, the reported association between hypertension and COVID-19 infection is likely to be confounded by age and comorbidities. Similarly, RAS blockers are frequently used to treat hypertension, and represent the backbone of therapy in hypertension and associated cardiovascular and renal comorbidities. 21 Accordingly, RAS blockers are thus expected to be frequently used in hospitalized patients as concomitant drugs. However, the use of RAS blockers in China is relatively low 26 compared with other first-line drug classes recommended in guidelines, e.g. calcium channel blockers. 28 ",

Rapid deterioration in COVID-19 patients is associated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. Accordingly, an increase in systemic interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and IL-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) has been observed in patients with COVID- 19. 38 Interestingly, the same cytokines have been associated with the development of hypertension in experimental 39, 40 and clinical observational, 37 as well as interventional, studies. 41 For example, IL-6 which appears to be strongly linked to clinical outcomes of COVID-19, 42 is one of the key cytokines regulating immune-inflammatory responses in hypertension. 43, 44 Loss of lymphocytes is one of the key features of COVID-19, and a recent study in the UK Biobank population demonstrated that among white blood cells, hypertension is causally associated with lymphocytes. 45 Moreover, it was shown that CD4\u00fe, and in particular CD8\u00fe, cells are dysregulated in hypertension, 43 demonstrating greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including COVID-19-related cytokines (IL-17, IL-7, IL-6, interferon-c, and TNF-a). 46 More interestingly, hypertension is associated with a particular immunosenescent profile in CD8\u00fe cells, 41, 46, 47 which are prone to overproduction of cytokines but are less efficient in antiviral defence. These immune mechanisms also contribute significantly to accelerated end-organ damage. 48, 49 Taken together, these data indicate accelerated ageing of the immune system in hypertension that may in part explain why hypertension is potentially associated with a more severe course of COVID- 19 . 47 To test this hypothesis, large-scale observational studies analysing the association between hypertension and COVID-19 infections and outcome with appropriate adjustments, particularly for age, are therefore urgently needed.",

            "text": "The RAS is a major regulator of cardiovascular and renal function including blood pressure control. [50] [51] [52] In the classical concept, the principal effector of the RAS is angiotensin II (Ang II) acting on Ang II type 1 receptors (AT 1 Rs) and type 2 receptors (AT 2 Rs) to mediate its main vascular effects as well as secretion of aldosterone from the adrenals. [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] The RAS is, however, a much more complex system with additional components and sites of action that influence not only blood pressure homeostasis and cardiovascular function, but also the function and injury of several organs [50] [51] [52] 54 including the lung. 55 Ang II is generated by the dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase ACE, which cleaves Ang I to produce Ang II 56 (Figure 2A ). An important counter-regulatory pathway within the RAS involves the mono-carboxypeptidase ACE2, angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), and the Mas receptor (MasR) that counterbalance the classical Ang II-AT 1 R axis of the RAS (Figure 2A) . [51] [52] [53] [54] The membrane-anchored ACE2 is a homologue of ACE, but is insensitive to ACEIs, 54, 57 and acts as a carboxypeptidase by cleaving single terminal residues from several bioactive peptides. ACE2 thereby converts mainly Ang II to Ang 1-7 and, with much lower efficiency, Ang I to Ang 1-9. 54 Ang 1-9 is also converted to Ang 1-7 by ACE for which it represents a competitive inhibitor, thereby decreasing Ang II levels. 54 The latter effect together with the activation of AT 2 R may contribute to protective effects of Ang 1-9. 58 ACE2 induces vasodilation by reducing Ang II effects and by increasing Ang 1-7 synthesis. Ang 1-7 binds to the MasR and thereby exhibits, in addition to nitric oxide release and activation of baroreflex sensitivity, several other effects that protect against tissue injury in the cardiovascular system, kidney, 59 and other organs. [51] [52] [53] Indeed, in several lung injury animal models, activation of the Ang II-AT 1 R axis has been associated with the severity of lung injury, while the augmentation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/ MasR signalling counteracts these detrimental effects ( Figure 2A) . 55 In several acute lung injury models, down-regulation of ACE2 was demonstrated. 55, 60 In mouse models of sepsis or acid aspiration, knockout of the gene coding for ACE2 (ace2) resulted in a more severe lung injury compared with wild-type mice. 61, 62 In contrast, mice deficient for the corresponding genes of ACE (ace) or AT 1 R (Ata1a) showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury. 61 Importantly, increased vascular permeability, one of the hallmarks in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is particularly pronounced in ACE2-deficient mice. 61 In contrast, the increase in vascular permeability and leakage was significantly attenuated in the lungs of knockout mice for AT 1 R (Ata1a). 61 Taken together with experimental studies showing beneficial effects of ACEIs 63, 64 or ARBs, 65, 66 or ACE2 supplementation, these data indicate that loss of ACE2 expression and increased Ang II-AT 1 R axis activation promote the disease in lung injury models. 55, 60, 67 Due to its terminal carboxypeptidase activity, ACE2 is also involved in the modification of other bioactive peptides 68 including the active metabolite of bradykinin, i.e. des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK). DABK is a wellknown pulmonary inflammatory mediator and ACE2 substrate. 69 A reduction in pulmonary ACE2 activity has recently been associated with activation of the DABK/bradykinin receptor B1 (BKDR1R) axis and more severe acute lung inflammation in a lung injury model in mice in response to endotoxin inhalation. 69 This finding provides further support and implications for the relevance of the network between the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS) and the RAS in several biological and pathological processes. 70 However, it is beyond the scope of this review to further explore the role of ACE2 in the KKS and this network. Moreover, the RAS is also linked to the natriuretic peptide system, another counterregulatory system that stimulates diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation. 54 Natriuretic peptides are inactivated by neprilysin [neutral endopeptidase (NEP)] which represents the therapeutic target for the NEP inhibitor sacubitril. 54 Neprilysin is involved in the cleavage of various biologically active peptides and activates the MasR pathway by generating Ang 1-7 from Ang II (Figure 2A) . Sacubitril has been developed and approved in combination with an ARB (angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; ARNI) for treatment of heart failure 71 and is also a potent blood pressure-lowering drug. 54 54 ). ACE2, a membrane-bound enzyme is cleaved (shedding) by ADAM17 into a soluble form released in the body fluids. 100 ACE2 opposes the harmful effects on lung injury of the Ang II-AT 1 R axis (elements in red) by activating MasR and AT 2 R signalling. (B) ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelial cells including alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) in the lung. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 binds through its viral spike protein to host cell membrane-bound ACE2, thereby promoting viral cell entry and subsequent replication. SARS-CoV-2 requires in addition the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which will process SARS-CoV-2 by enzymatic cleavage of the spike protein and support cell entry. Importantly, binding of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to down-regulation of ACE2, and thus its own binding receptor required for cell entry. Impairment of ACE2 activity in the lung results in activation of the harmful Ang II-AT 1 R axis. This aggravates the viral pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, tipping the scale in favour of lung damage. A soluble form of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is currently considered as a therapeutic approach to act as a decoy halting the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 to lessen viral entry. 109 In addition, an inhibitor for TMPRSS2, i.e. camostat mesylate, which is available and approved for other diseases, could be considered for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting cell entry. 6 Pharmacological treatment with ARBs (C) or ACEIs (D) will modulate several components of the RAS either directly or by affecting feedback loops. Treatment with ARBs protects against lung injury by AT 1 R receptor blockade. The corresponding increase in Ang II and Ang I levels will at the same time activate the protective axis and thereby reduce viral pathogenicity. ARBs have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in various tissues, though current evidence for the lungs (particularly in human) is lacking ( Table 1) . Assuming that ARBs can also up-regulate ACE2 in the lung, this will contribute to their protective effect. Protective Ang 1-7, can be also generated by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) or neprilysin. Therefore, the protective effect mediated by Ang1-7 is expected to be lower in response to treatment with ARNIs containing sacubitril. (D) Treatment with ACEIs can primarily protect from lung injury by reducing Ang II levels due to the inhibition of Ang I to Ang II conversion. Additional indirect effects supporting the protective axis can contribute to their beneficial effects. An overall effect on lung tissue protection could additionally be promoted by modulation of ACE2, albeit the data supporting this mechanism are scant ( Table 1) .

            "text": "The spike protein of SARS-CoV facilitates viral entry into target cells. 6, 73 Cell entry into target cells depends on the binding of the spike protein to a cellular receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the cell surface. In addition, SARS-CoV employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 as a cofactor for cell entry by priming of the spike protein. 6, 74, 75 Importantly, previous studies demonstrated that ACE2 represents the cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV by binding with its spike protein to ACE2. 73 It was further shown that the efficiency of ACE2 binding is a key determinant of SARS-CoV transmission. 76, 77 Recent studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 for cell entry and also employs TMPRSS2 for priming its spike protein. 5, 6 Consequently, ACE2, being the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, establishes the link between COVID-19 and the RAS ( Figure 2B) . ACE2 is expressed in the lung and several other tissues including the brain, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and adipose tissue. 50, 78 Human ACE2 was previously detected in ciliated airway epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal or tracheobronchial regions. 79 However, since viral cell entry for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 depends on both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, co-expression of the two proteins is necessary to acquire infectivity. In this regard, a more recent report demonstrated co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human nasal and respiratory sinuses, bronchial epithelium (in particular glandular epithelium), and alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) 80 (Supplementary material online, Table S1 ). In addition, co-expression was also documented in the gastrointestinal system (oesphagus, stomach, ileum, and colon), cardiomyocytes, and variably in blood vessels (endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells) and some other tissues, but the kidney was apparently not analysed. 80 In the kidney, however, at least ACE2 is abundantly expressed, particularly in the brush border of the proximal tubular cells. 81 The potential co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the kidney is indicated in Supplementary material online ,  Table S1 . Taken together, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in most epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract and therefore might support SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spread in and between individuals. 6, 80 Extrarespiratory spread might also be promoted in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, as has been suggested for SARS-CoV. 82 ,83 By using novel omic analyses including single-cell transcriptome analysis, coexpression patterns of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 will reveal further insights into possible transmission and dissemination patterns of SARS-CoV-2. 84, 85 Currently, apart from the respiratory system, the role of other organs and tissues for virus transmission and spreading, e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract, 86 is not well defined. Evidence exists that faecal excretion could facilitate faecal-oral transmission for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but not for SARS-CoV-2. 86 SARS-CoV-2 has been also detected in faeces or rectal swaps of COVID-19 patients, but not in urine samples. [87] [88] [89] The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples has been reported to be much higher as compared with faecal samples and thus may contribute to the preferential transmission of the virus in the respiratory tract. 87 Taken together, the respiratory tract appears as the main target for infectivity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and a time course analysis of viral load of SARS-CoV-2 indicated that posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples can be used for initial diagnosis and subsequent viral load monitoring of COVID-19. 89 Interestingly, Kuba et al. demonstrated that both SARS-CoV infection and injection of SARS-CoV spike protein alone into mice reduced ACE2 expression, and this down-regulation was associated with worsening of lung failure 62 ( Figure 2B) . Although it may seem counterintuitive at first that reduction of ACE2 induced by the virus increases lung damage, this is not surprising on closer examination. Indeed, as outlined above, downregulation of ACE2 was associated with lung injury in several animal models. 55, 60, 67 In agreement with these observations, Kuba et al. demonstrated worsening of lung damage in response to spike protein injection in conjunction with ACE2 suppression. 62 Furthermore, the worsening of lung failure in this setting could be attenuated by treatment with an ARB, clearly demonstrating that the activation of the pulmonary Ang II-AT 1 R axis influences the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV infection and that downregulation of ACE2 is a contributing mechanism, 55,62 as summarized in Figure 2B . Loss of pulmonary ACE2 is also thought to mediate acute lung injury induced by influenza viruses in mouse models. 90, 91 Collectively, although down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 has, to our knowledge, not been shown yet, the available data indicate a down-regulation of ACE2 in acute lung injury models and support a protective role for RAS blockade against lung injury in SARS-CoV and by extrapolation also in SARS-CoV-2 infections ( Figure 2B) .",

Therefore, they suggested to avoid RAS blockers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 95, 96 A review of the available literature on this topic revealed that the majority of studies were performed in rat models with a lower number of reports in human cells in vitro (summarized in Table 1 ). The few reports that analysed the effects of mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs) on ACE2 in rodents and in human cells in culture do not allow a meaningful assessment (Table 1) . Taken together, consistent changes of ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 protein (activity) in response to RAS blockade were not observed. Secondly, a more consistent up-regulation of ACE2 was observed for ARBs, while the modulation of ACE2 by ACEIs was more variable (Table 1) ",

Furthermore, the type and dosage of drugs used may play a role. Studies that investigate the effect of RAS blockade on ACE2 in humans are scarce. Furuhashi et al. showed a significant increase in the urinary excretion of ACE2 in hypertensive patients after treatment with an ARB for >1 year when compared with other antihypertensive agents including the ACEI enalapril. 97 A similar observation was reported in patients with diabetic nephropathy after chronic treatment with an ARB for 24 weeks. 98 In another study, however, the use of ARBs or ACEIs did not affect urinary ACE2 levels in patients with diabetes. 99 Taken together, these studies are not conclusive due to the complexity of measuring the circulating and urine levels of ACE2, since ACE2 is mainly a membrane-anchored enzyme. Physiologically, soluble ACE2 is generated by cleavage (shedding) of membrane-bound ACE2 by the disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) 100 (Figure 2A) . This mechanism also underlies the occurrence of ACE2 in the urine and other body fluids. Since ADAM17 is up-regulated by AT 1 R signalling (Figure 2A) , urinary ACE2 originating by shedding membrane-bound ACE2 from the proximal tubular apical brush border might increase in response to activation of the renal RAS. 101 Thus, it is expected that this effect will be blunted by ARBs. It therefore appears very difficult to predict the ",

Hence, the response to pharmacological RAS blockade by analysing ACE2 in the urine is highly complex due to the difference between the regulation of membrane-bound ACE2 and soluble ACE2, and the interplay of pathophysiological conditions and pharmacological interventions precluding meaningful conclusions. In this regard, one study performing analysis of ACE2 expression in biopsies obtained during gastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy is worth mentioning. 102 First, the authors demonstrated moderate expression of both ACE2 mRNA and protein in the brush border of small intestine enterocytes (duodenum and terminal ileum) and only low expression in the colon. Secondly, in duodenal samples, ACE2 was significantly (1.9-fold) up-regulated in subjects treated with an ACEI but not in subjects treated with an ARB as compared with untreated controls. 102 In contrast, and importantly, an up-regulation of ACE2 in the lung tissue in response to RAS blockade, particularly in humans, has not been reported.",

            "text": "The initially reported observational data suggesting an association between hypertension and COVID-19 are likely to be confounded by age and other co-morbidities. In LRTIs, diabetes and heart failure are associated with a complicated course, but hypertension per se is not. In contrast, low blood pressure values 11 and blood pressure drops within the first 24 h after hospital admission, as recently shown for CAP, 103 may represent risk factors for adverse outcome in COVID- 19 . This clearly highlights the need to closely monitor severely ill COVID-19 patients with haemodynamic instability and to withhold and adapt blood pressure-lowering therapies according to guidelines. 104 COVID-19 patients with hypotension and particularly critically ill patients are highly susceptible to acute kidney injury (AKI). 3, 105 Similarly, acute cardiac injury as evidenced by increased high-sensitivity troponin levels has been reported in COVID-19 patients and is possibly associated with the high inflammatory burden. 38, 106, 107 Regardless of the as yet unsolved question of whether the heart or kidneys are target organs for direct viral entry and replication of SARS-COV-2, the development of AKI and cardiac damage in patients with severe COVID-19 disease will clearly influence therapeutic strategies including the use of RAS blockers. This applies in particular to the critical use of these agents in AKI patients with significantly reduced renal function. 108 In contrast to these severely ill patients, because of concerns during a COVID-19 pandemic, RAS blockers should not be discontinued or withheld in stable patients with hypertension and associated diseases, e.g. heart failure, chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes, when indicated. 21, 22 Hence, there is currently no evidence to support the concept that use of ACEIs or ARBs could be harmful by increasing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Figure 3) . Impairing the backbone of pharmacotherapy in hypertension or heart failure by withholding or discontinuing RAS blockers in stable patients will have a significant impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality given the high prevalence of the diseases and the proven benefit of therapy. 21, 22, 71 In addition, there is ample experimental evidence that activation of the Ang II-AT 1 R axis promotes lung injury, while increases of ACE2 protect against lung injury ( Figure 2C and D) . The review of the available clinical studies in patients with LRTI and CAP support a beneficial effect of RAS inhibition in other infections. The potential of protecting lung injury by supplementing ACE2 has led to a clinical proof-of-concept study using recombinant human soluble ACE2 (rhACE2) in patients with COVID-19 (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04287686, Figure 2B ). It remains to be seen whether this approach supplementing the protective axis of the RAS will be efficacious against COVID- 19. In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers that inhibit the damaging (Ang II-AT 1 R) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung appears reasonable, rather than harmful to us.",
