The NUA includes a focus on urban resilience, climate and environment sustainability and disaster risk management. Among the 17th UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the 11th SDG focuses on Sustainable Cities and Communities. The 17th World Meteorological Congress' (Cg-17, June 2015) Resolution 68 \u2013 \u201cEstablishing a WMO cross-cutting urban focus\u201d recognized that WMO and its Members need to address these issues in an integrated fashion providing weather, climate, hydrological and related environmental services tailored to urban needs, and should build a new methodology and road map for its realization. To support the implementation of UN NUA and SDG11, WMO has adopted a cross-cutting urban focus as one of its priorities and suggested the novel concept and approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services \u2013 known as Integrated Urban Services (IUS) (WMO, 2018) to support safe, healthy, sustainable and resilient cities. The main goal is to develop science-based Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services (IUS), including Urban Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (UMHEWS), Integrated urban GHG Information Systems (IG3IS - urban), and climate services for sustainable and resilient cities, with the focus on impact-based forecast and risk-based warnings. Integrated Urban Services is a novel multidisciplinary approach, so research and development are critically needed for its development even at the initial stages.",

Within the four defined implementation objectives (IG3IS, 2018), the subnational/urban science team aims to support subnational government entities such as cities and states that represent large GHG source regions (e.g., megacities) with actionable information on their GHG emissions at the needed spatial, temporal and sectoral resolution to evaluate and guide progress towards emission reduction goals. In a first step a demand mapping has been conducted to identify typical needs of stakeholders at subnational scale related to GHG emissions and their GHG mitigation plans (see Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Realization of Integrated Urban Systems and Services requires unified complex and multi-disciplinary data bases and large scale data sets. Data sets from urban observations are collected by different agencies, with different systems, sensors, and for different requirements to provide evidence-based services (Perrels et al., 2020; Creutzig et al., 2019). In addition to \u201ctraditional\u201d observational data, there is another genre of data relevant to Integrated Urban Services. These include broad categories such as environmental, geomorphological, socio-economic, human population and activity, etc. (see WMO, 2018). They are essential to provide context and support for urban analyses and model applications addressing issues, including policy requirements, urban planning and assessments, emergency response, human behavior, etc. Development of urban database tools, like the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT; www.wudapt.org) is extremely important. WUDAPT (Ching et al., 2018) is an international community-based initiative to acquire and disseminate climate relevant data on the physical geographies of cities for modeling and analyses purposes. The current lacuna of globally consistent information on cities is a major impediment to urban climate science towards informing and developing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies at urban scales. WUDAPT consists of a database and a portal system; its database is structured into a hierarchy representing different levels of detail and data are acquired using innovative protocols that utilize crowdsourcing approaches, Geowiki tools, freely accessible data, and building typology archetypes. The base level of information (Level 0, or L0), categorizes and maps city landscapes into Local Climate Zones (LCZ), each category of which is associated with a range of values for model relevant surface descriptors (e.g. roughness, impervious surface cover, roof area, building heights, etc.). L0 data and the protocol for acquisition, storage and dissemination is best developed and provides a framework for gathering other data. WUDAPT Levels 1 (L1) and 2 (L2) will provide values for other relevant descriptors at greater precision, such as data morphological forms, material composition data and energy usage.",

The advent of automatic weather station (AWS) networks of HKO and other government departments since the mid-1980s has significantly expanded data coverage both in terms of spatial and temporal resolution with over 200 AWSs providing a wide range of meteorological measurements (e.g. rainfall, temperatures, winds, etc.). Regular upper-air soundings and the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing observations (e.g. Doppler weather radar, wind profilers, LIDARs (light detection and ranging), satellite reception systems, etc.) also enable the monitoring of meteorological parameters beyond the near-surface levels through the depth of the atmosphere. The implementation of the Community Weather Information Network (Co-WIN) in 2007 further extended the meteorological measurement network to the school and community levels (Tam and Ong, 2012). EPD has been monitoring the air quality in Hong Kong since 1990, and currently operates a network of 16 air quality monitoring stations in Hong Kong (EPD, 2018).

Integrated services for this event were directed towards three major end-users: the TO15 organization (regular briefings), the police, and public health organizations (partnership for the extended region surrounding Toronto). The key success was improved communications between researchers and those involved in operations and services for the different sectors (public and marine weather, air quality, UV, nowcasting, emergency preparedness, public health) and for different organizations (ECCC, Health Canada, public health regional and municipal organizations, some universities, and a network of provincial and municipal government partners). ECCC project objectives for the Games were: 1) to provide advanced capacity to issue weather warnings, 2) to forecast weather conditions (in particular at the sport venues sites), 3) to provide climatological information, 4) to support critical weather sensitive government services, and 5) to monitor atmospheric conditions (Johnston et al., 2017). An overview of the daily ECCC operation cycle is presented in Fig. 5\n.

As an example, although public health requested a full range of data (model outputs for heat, air quality, UV, etc.) for the web-based portal WISDOM, many small units did not have sufficient staff or the expertise to use these data to their fullest. Direct provision of more integrated indicators such as the AQHI (Air Quality Heat Index, Environment Canada, 2016) more adapted to decision-making would probably be more efficient and sufficient.

ECCC and the University of Toronto have successfully built a high-resolution (2.5 \u00d7 2.5 km2) emission inventory \u2018SOCE\u2019 (Southern Ontario Carbon Emission) for CO2 based on air quality emission maps for the TO15 domain (Pugliese et al., 2018). Significant differences of up to 40% for total annual emissions were found in the urban domain when compared to existing inventories. In comparison, the climate action plan for the city of Toronto is to reduce GHG emissions by 30% between 1990 and 2010. Furthermore, the contribution of different emission categories is also significantly different as e.g. SOCE predicts traffic to contribute 24 MTCO2 a\u22121, while EDGAR V4.2 (EDGAR, 2010) predicts nearly twice the amount, i.e. 41 MTCO2 a\u22121. To build confidence and investigate the differences in these emission datasets we compared their ability to correctly predict atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As a benchmark, a forward simulation using an air-quality model was compared to CO2 observations at ECCC sites, i.e. the mean daily cycle for winter 2016. Pugliese et al. (2018) showed that the novel SOCE inventory displays the best performance with only minor deviations from observed atmospheric CO2 at the Downsview measurement site as seen in Fig. 7\n.",

Inland cities, like Paris however, are more focused on heat waves and river flooding. For these cities, the expected climate change especially points to the risk of future increases in the frequency and intensity of heat waves (Lemonsu et al., 2014). This is why, even if this is not the only hazard, adaptation to heat waves and mitigation of Urban Heat Islands has become a priority for many French cities, such as Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, and Rennes, even though these cities are under contrasting summer climates (much warmer in Toulouse than Rennes or Lille).

Using a complete vegetation and soil model to represent green roofs, De Munck et al. (2018) showed that green roofs would not have a significant effect on air temperature at street level, contrary to ground vegetation and trees. Impacts on hydrology are now included in the model (Stavropulos-Laffaille et al., 2018) and will allow study of the combined UHI-hydrology impacts on Paris and its suburbs. The model developments also permitted testing of implementing alternative urban energy systems; Masson et al. (2014b) showed that solar panels could be widely implemented without adverse effect on the UHI (where a slight cooling, of approximately 0.2 \u00b0C, was simulated). Air conditioning can increase night-time temperatures in more densely built parts of Paris by more than 1 \u00b0C (De Munck et al., 2013), so a Building Energy Module (Pigeon et al., 2014) is also a desirable component of the modeling system to evaluate anthropogenic heat fluxes to the atmosphere. Energetic human behavior has been including in TEB (Schoetter et al., 2017) thanks to a collaboration with sociologists (Bourgeois et al., 2017). The modeling system then permits testing the impacts of not only changes to the character of the urban structure (insulation), but also eventually, societal change, such as aging of the population, who may demand greater use of building cooling during summertime. This emphasizes the interdisciplinary interactions that are needed to study the urban system and build UCS.",

Interactions are of course needed at the co-construction stage, in order to build UCS that are both pertinent for the user and feasible. Transfer tools are also needed to utilize the full potential of the UCS results (Hidalgo et al., 2018). In the Toulouse case, the analysis of the current vulnerability of the city to heat waves used the urban climate map approach. It was further improved by using the Local Climate Zones approach (Stewart and Oke, 2012), a now common way to represent urban neighborhoods from a climatic perspective. Modelled temperature and wind fields were provided at 250 m resolution. Local weather types (with specific weather types linked to the city site, not synoptic-scale weather regimes) (Hidalgo et al., 2014) proved a nice way to communicate with the stakeholder and for the stakeholder to comprehend the variability of the urban climate of their city. Finally, in order to facilitate integration of urban climate issues within the urban planning practice, sociologists and researchers in law analyzed various French legal documents related to planning to point out the most appropriate places where quantitative information or incentives should be included.",

Greenhouse Gas testbed cities combine state-of-the-art regional atmospheric monitoring and high-resolution monitoring, along with other elements such as short term forecasting for high-impact weather and AQ episodes. Urban-scale greenhouse gas studies provide additional scope for IUS that try to link stakeholder demand with existing technical skills. An improved understanding of GHG emissions from combustion sources can also lead to a better prediction of air pollutants that are co-emitted in the same process. For example, the ability to identify leakages of CH4 and related VOCs in an urban area that can have significant impact on air quality (increased ozone levels) and thus important health implications. Greenhouse gas studies in Paris (France), Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City (USA), Recife (Brazil) (Staufer et al., 2016; Turnbull et al., 2015; Newman et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) have contributed to efforts under WMO's IG3IS (https://ig3is.wmo.int/) and the CO2-USA (http://sites.bu.edu/co2usa) network. Work can range from simple surveys of atmospheric GHGs to identification of major GHG sources to long-term monitoring to track emission changes and even into process-specific studies. It is obvious that GHG are targeted by many policies to achieve the Paris agreement, but beyond this they are also an important puzzle piece in the IUS approach that is intrinsically linked with understanding urban circulation (weather) and air pollutants.",

For example, the use of burning renewable biomass like wood for heating, which is clearly positive in reducing fossil fuel use, but can significantly increase emissions of particulate matter and deteriorate air quality. An example of multi-benefit policies is the greening of cities. Additional tree planting will help sequester a certain amount of CO2, while also helping to counter act urban heat island effects.",

Assessment of integration can also vary for different components of an IUS so that the same city may receive multiple categorizations. A crude categorization by quadrants (Q) recognizes IUS with low levels of integration on either axis (Q1), strong integration across sectors, so a city with partners, but reliant on simple data provision (Q2), a more comprehensive integration of data products from service providers tuned to urban needs but without a lot of urban partners (Q3) and, at its most mature, maximum integration on both axes (Q4), which represents specialized products developed collaboratively with urban partners (WMO, 2019). Table 3 shows the level of integration according to these quadrants. Not surprisingly, the case study cities show maturity of IUS (Q4) in at least one component of their IUS. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory partnered with the Environmental Protection Department and other government departments to create an integrated system where users are supported by various weather, climate and environmental services through a combination of communication approaches (Fig. 2). Mexico City's C5 Centre provides a broad mechanism for communication of hazards to the public. In Toronto, a major international sporting event provided the opportunity to build initial relations with select end users (event organizers, security, and public health) and to facilitate partnerships among government agencies at different levels. However, the legacy of these relations and partnerships has to be strengthened and organized, and gaps were noted in the training and ability of local agencies to use research outputs provided by forecasters. In Paris, urban planning elements of the IUS directed towards modeling for climate change adaptation was most advanced, with research projects providing the basis for integration among sectors with incorporation of researchers from different academic backgrounds providing key input on the research. Multi-hazard early warning systems for Paris however were much less advanced, with largely a data-only availability and little integration with partners.",
