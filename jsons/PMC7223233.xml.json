Yet, studies on outcomes after complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) in the elderly populations are very limited. There is evidence that postoperative morbidity and mortality is higher in elderly as compared to non-elderly and increasing age itself remains an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality [5]. The world health organization (WHO) consider the chronological age of 65 years as an \u2018elderly\u2019 or older person [6]. Similarly, in the United States also age \u2265 65 is considered elderly [7]. The biologic mesh has been suggested in the contaminated field or high-risk patients [8\u201310] undergoing CAWR. We use non-cross linked acellular porcine dermal matrix (Strattice\u2122) in all patients at high-risk for infections and those with contaminated field undergoing CAWR. Our initial results of CAWR with Strattice\u2122 were encouraging hence this particular mesh type was utilized [11].",

In our study, the incidence of SSIs was comparable between the two groups and was associated with a statistically similar rate of reoperations before and after PSM.
