Furthermore, they showed that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural protein domains showed that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, they confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV [4] .",

The authors described the infusion procedure, suspending MSCs in 100 mL of saline solution, and reporting the total number of infused cells was 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per kg. The window period for cell transplantation has been defined as the time when symptoms or/and signs still were getting worse. The injection was performed for about 40 min with a speed of~40 drops per minute [1] .",

Subcutaneous adipose tissue has a significant edge over other MSCs because it is easily accessible while posing the least amount of discomfort to the patient and being easy to use with local anesthesia. Moreover, it is easy to isolate the target stem cells from the tissue that has been harvested [22, 23] . Additionally, a higher quantity of stem cells has been observed in fat compared to bone marrow [24] . MSCs are essentially cells that renew on their own, in addition to being multipotent, having the capacity to split into cells of mesenchymal origin in vitro; this includes chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts. Human ASCs, as the first exponent of MSCs, expressing the classical mesenchymal markers such as CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166 [21] , are located in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) portion of subcutaneous fat, in which are contained Stromal Vascular Fraction cells (SVFs) [25] . For these reasons, it is possible to identify the ASCs as 'Adiposederived Stromal Stem Cells. ' The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) and International Federation for Adipose Therapeutics and Science (IFATS) [26] suggested several parameters to define SVFs and ASCs and to consider them MSCs:",

[1] showed that intravenous MSC infusion could reduce the over-activation of the immune system and support repair by modulating the lung microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2 infection even in elderly patients. Intravenous infusion of MSCs typically leads to their accumulation in the lungs, where they secrete multiple paracrine factors [41, 49] . The high secretory activity makes also ASCs, in quality of MSCs, a potentially suitable vehicle for the delivery of drug molecules in the cellular microenvironment, with the potential aim to regenerate damaged tissue as for to nanotechnologies, drug-loaded exosomes, and micro-RNAs (MiRs) [50] . Several MiRs are present in fat, actively participating in the adipogenesis regulation, adipokine secretion, inflammation, and inter-cellular communications in the tissues. These results provide important insights into adipocytesecreted exosomal microRNA (A-Se-MiR) function and they suggest evaluating the potential role of A-Se-MiR in human organs and tissue regeneration [50] .",
