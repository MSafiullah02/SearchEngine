In the 1970s, 1980s, and even 1990s, risk was generally equated to financial, exchange rate, and inflationary risks and, in particular, \"political risk,\" which was reflective of host-government hostility toward foreign investment during much of this time. Political risk was country-specific and could be summed up as the likelihood that a multinational enterprise's foreign operations could be constrained by host-government policies through measures such as forced divestment, unwelcome regulation, and interference with operations. Accordingly, risk management was also country-specific and involved assessing the riskiness of a particular country through a variety of predictive approaches. Where a country was deemed too risky, the firm would avoid investing or withdraw its current investment. Other risk-management devices also involved responding to risk that largely emanated from host governments. Indeed, defensive political risk-management strategies involved locating crucial aspects of the company's operations beyond the reach of the host, while integrative strategies aimed to make the firm an integral part of the host society, thereby minimizing the risk of government intervention. However, as the world economy has become increasingly global, political risk, while still present, is arguably not as pressing as before. This is largely because of a change in attitude toward trade and investment, with most countries now encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI). Indeed, between 1991 and 2003, more than 165 countries made 1,885 changes in legislation governing FDI, with 95 percent of these changes involving the liberalization of FDI regulations. This has also been supported by a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties, as well as regional and global free-trade agreements (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2041, "end": 2056, "text": "[UNCTAD], 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Management of Risk"}, {"text": "At the same time, we have witnessed the emergence of a new type of environmental business threat that has manifested itself in incidents such as global terrorism, SARS, financial crises, and computer viruses, all of which have the ability to disrupt a firm's operations. Enderwick (2003) describes such threats as being sudden, unexpected, and unpredictable, with the ability to spread quickly through global processes and forces, thus having a widespread impact but with a disproportionate impact on regions, sectors, and industries. Clearly, risk is no longer country-specific, nor is it limited to threats from host-government actions. Instead, it is global and systemic, and capable of being perpetrated by individuals or small groups. Further, such threats do not simply affect a firm's operating conditions, but also its overall viability, as they can cause severe disruptions, threatening the very survival of the firm. Accordingly, new strategies for managing this type of threat are required, and they cannot be avoided by simply deciding not to invest in a particular country, or by using strategies centered on host governments. However, while in the past risk was largely seen as negative, it should be noted that these environmental uncertainties provide both challenges as well as opportunities for those businesses that have the ability to respond quickly and effectively (Enderwick, 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 287, "text": "Enderwick (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1404, "text": "(Enderwick, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Management of Risk"}, {"text": "It is useful to clarify the exact nature of a disruption such as SARS in terms of risk and uncertainty.

According to Knight's analysis, risk is considered as the variation in potential outcomes to which an associated probability can be assigned. In statistical terms, while the distribution of the variable is known, the particular value that will be realized is not. Uncertainty exists when there is no understanding of even the distribution of the variable. For decision making, uncertainty is a greater problem than risk.

These types of disruptions share a number of characteristics. First, they can be considered as \"jolts\" (Meyer, 1982 ) that occur randomly. No one anticipated the emergence of SARS, or any similar virus. Because such events are not continuous or even regular, it is not possible to assign probabilities to them. Second, the nature of these jolts is such that they evolve, changing their forms, and do not simply recur. For example, viruses such as SARS and avian bird flu are capable of mutating and assuming different forms with differing impacts. In the case of avian bird flu, there have been recent reports of the first full case of human-to-human transmission, and a recurring fear is that it could mutate into a human pandemic with devastating effects. Similarly, global terrorism assumes a variety of forms including car bombs, suicide bombers, aircraft as weapons of destruction, and chemical attacks. This makes it difficult to use historical experience as a predictor of future occurrences and impacts. Third, the impact of these uncertainties tends to be concentrated, either by sector or by geographical location. As the next section makes clear, the primary effects of SARS were experienced in Asia and disproportionately affected the transport, tourism, and medical industries. The impacts of natural disasters such as extreme weather events or financial and political problems appear to be more widely and randomly distributed.

Connected to the idea of the growing importance of the state is the need for open and transparent government. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the need for transparency is paramount if a crisis is to be contained. China's initial understating of the number of confirmed cases, refusal to give daily reports, and blocking of WHO specialists from visiting Guangdong (the origin of SARS) allowed SARS to spread rapidly (Lavella, 2003) . It was only after China began reporting the true seriousness of the situation and allowed WHO officials to investigate that the SARS crisis slowly came under control. In contrast, Vietnam was able to contain the virus relatively quickly through prompt and open reporting, the early request for WHO assistance, and rapid case detection, isolation, infection control, and vigorous contact tracing (WHO, 2003) . Accordingly, any attempt to conceal a crisis such as SARS for fear of the social and economic consequences can only be regarded as a short-term measure that ultimately risks the situation spiraling out of control (WHO, 2003) . Second, it is in the interests of government to be open and transparent, as in today's turbulent and unpredictable environment, investors are now placing a premium on governments that can be trusted.

Business was also affected, as foreigners cancelled conferences and meetings in countries in Asia, such as South Korea, that had not reported a single SARS case.

A lack of precise knowledge does not preclude decision makers from further information gathering or from making decisions about likely probabilities of events occurring. As has been recognized, traditional strategic management approaches encourage perceptions of uncertainty in a binary fashion (Courtney, Kirkland, & Viguerie, 1997) . The world is seen either as sufficiently certain that precise, and usually single, predictions of the future can be made, or that uncertainty renders such an approach totally ineffective. In the latter case, there may be a temptation to abandon analytical approaches and to rely wholly on gut instinct. Courtney et al. (1997) argue that in many cases uncertainty can be significantly reduced through careful search for additional information; in effect, much that is unknown can be made knowable. The uncertainty that remains after the most thorough analysis they term residual uncertainty. There are a number of approaches that offer insights into how to manage uncertainty. The simplest approach is to ignore it. This can be done by developing a \"most likely prediction\" often based on \"expert input\" or by assigning a margin of error to key variables. Each of these approaches yields a single unequivocal strategic option by either ignoring uncertainty or assigning it a probability. Neither approach is satisfactory. Ignoring an uncertain environmental event is clearly dangerous. Assigning probabilities to unique events is invalid. Even subjective probability derived from expert analysis is untestable and arbitrary. Miller (1992) highlights a useful distinction between financial riskmanagement and firm-strategy approaches to managing environmental uncertainties. Financial risk-management techniques such as insurance and futures contracts reduce the firm's exposure to specific risks without changing the underlying strategy. But, as noted earlier, such techniques only apply to risks, not uncertainties. In the case of an event such as SARS, strategic responses, which attempt to mitigate the firm's exposure to uncertainties, are likely to be more useful.

In the same way a cooperative strategy deals primarily with behavioral risk and is not likely to be effective, neither is an imitative strategy that addresses competitive rivalry.

Firms recognized that problems could arise if a factory needed repair help to continue manufacturing but engineers could not be sent due to travel bans (Wonacott, Chang, & Dolven, 2003) .

This is especially so where the impacts of events like SARS and terrorism are disproportionately borne by certain sectors or locations (Enderwick, 2003) . Accordingly, corporate strategies may now require this \"portfolio approach\" so that a firm is not overly focused on one sector or location. For example, the SARS crisis, coupled with a more global world market, is likely to see exporters increase diversification in both products and geographical markets. On a larger scale, economies may also look to become more diversified, as SARS revealed that many Asian countries were heavily dependent on the services sector (Shanmugaratnam, 2003) .

Indeed, SARS illustrated the difficulty of trying to predict where the next threat will come from and has called into question traditional linear planning and forecasting. Such planning techniques work on the assumption that the environment in the future will be very much like today, and that extrapolation is meaningful. However, in today's turbulent and disruptive environment, this assumption is no longer valid and what are needed are plans that are flexible enough to adapt to the circumstances (Pritchard, 2003) . Accordingly, the SARS crisis is likely to accelerate the current trend toward the adoption of scenario planning. Rather than forecasting a specific future or \"most likely outcome,\" scenario planning builds on existing knowledge to develop several plausible future scenarios and then necessitates constructing robust strategies that will provide competitive advantage no matter what specific events unfold. As such, it encourages firms to think about \"worstcase\" scenarios, which may include technological, economic, political, or environmental calamities. Schnaars (1986) discusses a number of different approaches that can be adopted when designing strategy for multiple scenarios. Accordingly, scenario planning forces firms to pay closer attention to internal, external, and the broader global environmental factors that may influence the firm's future. This process challenges firms to avoid complacency in their strategy formulation and encourages managers to think more broadly and unconventionally and view events with a new perspective (Lohr, 2003) , an essential requirement in trying to prepare for unknowable shocks and crises (Kennedy, Perrottet, & Thomas, 2003) .
