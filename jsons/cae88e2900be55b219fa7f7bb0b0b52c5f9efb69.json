Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, the WHO posited that Nigeria's capacity to manage LF remains suboptimal at the sub-national levels with weakened infection prevention and control (IPC) measures (WHO, 2020). Nigeria's healthcare system has inadequately managed the recurring LF outbreaks in previous years with grossly inadequate diagnostic kits and referral centres, high mortality involving health professionals and poor surveillance and management. Since the management of COVID-19 and LF cases in Nigeria demands shared clinical and laboratory facilities, confronting COVID-19 and LF simultaneously will add severe diagnostic difficulties to the poor and inadequate facilities available. Although a majority of LF infected persons are asymptomatic, severe cases are characterized by febrile illness associated with severe diarrhoea, haemorrhage and multiple organ dysfunction (Awosanya, 2018) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with patients in dare need of healthcare facilities alongside COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, due to the inadequate molecular diagnostics for the detection and confirmation of COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Job and Wiwanitkit, 2020) , the possibility of misdiagnosis of these 2 viral infections is high in Nigeria. Pseudo-serological results for COVID-19 in LF patients and vice versa cannot be overruled. Most importantly, although no cases of COVID-19 and LF coinfection has been reported among patients, the possibility of such occurrence cannot be precluded. With the simultaneously increasing cases of COVID-19 and LF across Nigeria, both outbreaks will be catastrophic.",

Farm produce especially grains and other foodstuffs in homes should be effectively stored in rodent-proof bags while household garbage should be disposed far from residential areas. Also, contact with secretions, excretions and blood from infected persons should be avoided. For robust and effective containment of these 2 outbreaks, Nigeria needs to adequately equip its health centres with available, contemporary and functional diagnostic facilities and kits. Additionally, due to wild misconceptions regarding COVID-19 and LF, urgent public health enlightenment campaigns across Nigeria are needed for both control and minimization of the outbreaks.",
