Other than supportive care, there are no SARS-CoV-2 specific treatments available for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) or those admitted to the hospital. In addition, there are no vaccines available to protect our at-risk healthcare workers. The National Institutes of Health is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate for a potential vaccine.2 We present a brief overview of the potential prophylactic and treatment agents under investigation, some of which could be initiated in the ED if proven effective.",

Hoffmann et al found that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter cells and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.8 Hoffmann et al utilized this information and found that convalescent SARS-CoV serum, which is known to have a neutralizing antibody against the viral S protein, decreased SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell in vitro. They also found that rabbit serum raised against the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV virus inhibited SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell in vitro. These data suggest that neutralizing antibody responses raised against SARS-CoV might offer protection against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, given that TMPRSS2 is required for entry, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, although not convalescent serum, is another possible target.",
