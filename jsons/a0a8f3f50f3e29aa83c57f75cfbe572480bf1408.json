The supervision and analysis of population migration are necessary for guiding the optimal allocation of urban resources and for attaining the high efficiency development of region. Currently, the explorations of population migration are often restricted by the limitation of data. In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration. Based on the search query from Baidu search engine, three migration attention indexes (MAIs) are constructed to capture public migration attention in cyber space. Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow. Along with the accumulation of cyber search query data, its potential in exploring population migration can be further reinforced.",

The floating of population is not only the flowing of individual human but also the transfer of demand, information, and technique carried by individuals [1, 2] . They discriminately impact economic, social, and political development of both resettled areas and out-migrating areas [3, 4] . Timely measuring and analyzing of population migration are particularly crucial for suitably planning urban space and distributing urban resources.",

A larger body of researches have been conducted, such as the labor market performance, social and physical status of migration [5] [6] [7] , the causes of migration flow [8] [9] [10] , the consequent impacts of migration [11] [12] [13] , the changing migration policies [14] [15] [16] , the classification research of population migration [17, 18] , the spatial pattern of population migration [19] , etc. These researches have been conducted mainly based on three kinds of data: national censuses data, regional field survey data, and cyber big data. In the traditional migration researches, population censuses and field survey are the principal sources to provide population data [20, 21] . For instance, Zhu [22] explored the determined factors in urban area which influence migrants' settlement intention based on the data from a survey on the floating population in the coastal area of Fujian Province. He et al. [23] adopted national census data to examine the distinctive spatial patterns of floating and Hukou population and evaluated their consequent impact on Chinese urbanization and industrialization. With the development of cyber space and the popularization of personal mobile termination, numerous researches have implemented under the assistance of data from cyber space exploration of the change, characteristic, and pattern of population migration [24] [25] [26] [27] . For instance, Blumenstock [28] analyzed migration pattern based on mobile phone records and revealed more subtle patterns that were not detected in the government population survey. Zagheni et al. [29] used geolocated data for about 500,000 users of the social network website \"Twitter\" to predict turning points in migration trends and to improve the understanding of migrant populations.",

However, the deficiencies in migration data still exist. Studies based on national censuses data can explore the migrants in a large range but with a relatively large time interval of ten years, which hinders the short time-series analysis of population migration, and little can be inferred for specific years between censuses and for recent trends [29] . The researches based on field survey can provide detailed migration information, but it asks for a lot of time, manpower, and material resource to deploy, which are expensive for many researches. Simultaneously, the field survey often has a certain spatial location and cannot cover a large spatial scope. The increasing cyber data has opened up a new opportunity to deepen our understanding of population migration. However, studies based on the network big data always need to deal with extensive data and complicated procedures in acquiring and processing the data. At the same time, some data sources are not available openly, such as cellphone signal data and GPS data of resident activities, because those types of data include much individual private information that is protected by national law. A type of data with open, timelier, and easy-taking characteristics is necessary for effectively investigating the migration population.",

Web search engine as the most widely used Internet tools provides massive information to the migrants and obtains relevant public attention on the specific subject of migration. The relationship between Internet search query data and population migration deserves more attention. However, the relationship between them is still unclear and there are a number of questions to be raised: can the search query data generated from migration-related information search offer some clues about population migration? If they can, how are they related? Do cites with higher cyber search quantity have a larger migration population than the cities with lower search quantity?",

A hypothesis can be made that the search queries generated from individual migration-related search can positively reflect population migration. Based on the search query data from Baidu search engine, we construct a series of migration attention indexes (MAIs) to explore public attention on migration. Taking three main urban agglomeration areas of China as study area, the correlation analysis has been utilized to explore the relationship between MAIs and population migration to test the hypothesis. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the study area and data. Section 3 elucidates the methodology of this paper, including the method and indicators that we applied in this paper. Section 4 reports the result of correlation analysis between 3 of 18 MAI and population migration. Section 5 conducts further discussion based on the results in our study area.

There are 38 cities located in these regions, 10 cities from BTH, 16 from YRD, and 9 from PRD, as shown in Figure 1 . These regions are chosen based on the following reasons: (1) Extensive population migration can be detected in these areas. In 2015, the migration population in these areas has reached more than 8 million in total, accounting for 30.77% in China. Exploration of migration in these regions can avoid the influence of random migration under the support of large quantities. (2) These regions with relatively higher internet penetration offer adequate search query data. By the end of 2015, internet penetrations of core cities in those three urban metropolitan areas are separately 76.5% for Beijing, 73.1% for Shanghai, 78.4% for Guangzhou, and 83.2% for Shenzhen. More widespread application of the internet can be identified in almost all the provinces cover BTH, YRD, and PRD [34] .

(1) There are three kinds of population migration data used in this study: the net inflow population, intercity population flow, and the floating population. The net inflow population delineates the total population migrated into the city during a specific period. Intercity population flow is the population migrate from the original city to the terminal city. Based on the prevalent use of series Tencent's applications (e.g., Wechat is the most used software for 79.6% of Chinese netizens), more precise expression on the migration of population in China can be provided by Tencent migration map under the support of enormous user base. Considering the merit of Tencent migration map and avoiding the self-certification of Baidu, we obtained the net inflow population and intercity population flow from Tencent migration map (https://heat.qq.com/qianxi.php) through web crawler technology. Due to the specific Hukou policy in China (which has been regarded as the central mechanism underlying the unsettled nature of the floating population), the floating population has been defined as the population living in the objective city more than six months without local registered Hukou [35] . It was obtained through the deviance calculation of permanent residential population and household population in the local city, which were collected from regional statistical bureaus. (2) We obtain the search query data based on the support of Baidu search engine, which is the most widely used search engine in China and freely provides the search trend of objective terms through Baidu Index (http://index.baidu.com/). The average daily queries of each migration keyword versus the name of the city (e.g., job + Beijing) from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 were collected based on Baidu Index. (3) Relevant socioeconomic data were acquired from regional statistical bureau, including the Tertiary Industrial Output-Value, Participant Rate of Urban Basic Medical Care System, the number of schools, etc. The migration reasons were collected from the dynamic monitoring survey of China's migration population in 2015, which was conducted by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China.",

The confirmation of search keywords is comprehensively confirmed under five steps. First, according to the least effort principle in network information retrieval behaviors, users incline to choice the search keywords in their common language with brief and straightforward features [21, 36, [41] [42] [43] [44] . We set the candidate keywords with brief structure and expressed them in Chinese. Second, the specific content of candidate keywords was derived from the three main migration reasons. Relevant search terms for them were selected by brainstorming common words used in searching for migration and review of related literature [21, [45] [46] [47] . Third, we have compared the daily average search query data of designated search keywords with similar words during the same period to confirm that the selected keywords are the most popular search keywords in the related aspects. For example, \"\u79df\u623f (house renting)\" has been compared to \"\u51fa\u79df (rent)\" and \"\u79df\u8d41 (lease)\"; collecting and organizing their average daily Baidu Index can find that \"house renting\"(11,795) gets much more attention than \"rent\"(477) and \"lease\"(636). Fourth, we sift the candidate words to follow the principle of search query data for each keyword in each city to be delineated as a sequential time series with a yearly resolution. Fifth, the correlation analysis between the last candidate keywords has been conducted and the one with a high correlation with others has been removed to reduce data redundancy. Through the comprehensive consideration of keyword selection, the last keywords can be viewed as not only representing the meaning itself but also including some clues for other potential keywords. Finally, six Chinese keywords from Baidu index have been confirmed to express public attention on migration in cyber space as list in Table 2 . The migration attention indexes (MAIs) are designed to comprehensively express public attention on migration in cyber space comprehensively. First, we combine the candidate search keywords with the name of objective cities to obtain the cityward migration keywords, such as \"school + Beijing\", \"house price + Shanghai\", \"recruitment + Shenzhen\", etc.; second, the average daily search volume of these cityward keywords are acquired based on Baidu Index from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015; third, the population percentages of different migration reasons are viewed as index weight to synthesize the corresponding Baidu Index into MAIs; fourth, according to the origin location of Baidu Index, the local-MAI, external-MAI, and intercity-MAI are separately constructed to express public migration attention on objective cities from internal area of the objective cities, external areas, and other specific cities. The relationship among those indexes can be depicted as follows:",

Based on the push-pull theory which has been widely used in analyzing migration action and willing [48] [49] [50] [51] , we confirmed the UAM from urban pull perspective. The major migration reasons confirmed by the dynamic monitoring survey of China's migration population have been employed as reference in confirming the objective content of UAM, including work and business, study and training, and relocation. The three aspects separately correspond with the three major migration reasons as job opportunity and income level, living condition, and educational opportunity of children. Based on the data availability principle and integrated analysis of previous studies, eight indicators with respect to three aspects of urban pulling power have been selected as shown in Table 3 . From job and income perspectives, Tertiary Industrial Output-Value (TIV) [52] and Urban Residents' Per Capita Disposable Income (IPC) [43] were employed to reflect urban job opportunities and income level; Unemployment Rate (UR), Participant rate of Urban Basic Medical Care System (RBM) [53] , and Per Capita Living Area (LPC) [43] were utilized to expose the living condition of local residents; Number of Regular Primary Schools (PSN), Number of Regular Secondary Schools (SSN), and Number of University (UN) were applied to reveal educational opportunity for migrants' children [44] . Last, we adopted the principal component analysis (PCA) to integrate the index system and to obtain the indicator which reflects urban comprehensive attractiveness for migrants. The components with eigenvalues greater than 1 and the cumulative ratio of total variance greater than 85% are extracted and rotated with the varimax method in SPSS 19.0 (International Business Machines Corporation, New York, USA), so that each factor has the minimum number of high load variables, which can be expressed as follows:",

Based on the push-pull theory of migration, in the cities with higher urban pulling force, more influx of population can be observed. Through the calculation of UAM, which depicted urban pulling force, the city with higher external-MAI can observe higher UAM. The feature of external-MAI coincides with the setting of push-pull theory. Further, exploring the relationship between external-MAI and the indexes which reflect urban migration attractiveness, there are significant correlations between tertiary industrial output-value and urban residents' per capita disposable income with the external-MAI in the whole study area. Most of the cities with higher job opportunities and income levels receive more migration attentions from the outside area. This finding coincides with the dynamics monitoring survey of migration population suggesting a migration reason in Table 1 (work and trade as the predominant migration reason), which can represent the ability of MAI indexes in capturing the impact of migration reasons. With respect to the indexes described urban living conditions, there are no significant correlations between the population migration attention and unemployment rate or per capita living area, this results may correspond to the great exception of potential migrants for their future urban condition, which can be explained by the Todaro migration model from the perspective of development economics. Todaro migration model argues that the migration of population is based on the \"expected profit\" of migrants. The hardships in urban life have not obtained enough attention from potential migrants, particularly for the rural-urban migrants who lack the necessary information as they enter a new different world [43] . Further, the more schools a city has, the more public migration attention it receives. The positive correlation existing between the education indexes (the number of primary schools, secondary schools, and universities) and external public migration attention exposes that the educational opportunities also intensify the level of urban migration attention. In PRD, the focus of educational concern only derives from the consideration of secondary schools; significant correlation has not been observed between the number of the other two levels of schools in the area, which may be attributed to the relatively lower education level of Guangzhou Province (the administrative province that PRD belongs to) than the other two urban agglomerations.",
