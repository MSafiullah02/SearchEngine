Seven- to nine-week-old, male C57BL/6 mice were purchased (Harlan, Inc) and allowed to acclimatize for at least 1 week. Male mice were used to avoid the confounding effect of the female estrous cycle and the well-characterized sexual dimorphism of the adaptive response to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).20 The seven experimental groups were designed to make classification difficult, reflecting clinically important distinctions relevant to care of ICU patients: lethal abdominal inflammation from a sterile source, lethal abdominal infection, and antibiotic-treated abdominal infection. Mice were assigned to the seven treatments listed in Table 1, grouped into those with no deaths (controls) and those that were \u201csick\u201d with substantial associated mortality (sterile or infectious causes of systemic inflammation). Normal animals were untreated. Previously reported protocols were used to perform CLP and sham laparotomy.21, 22 The ceca of some animals were punctured twice using a 25-gauge needle (CLP), and others were punctured using a 27-gauge needle to produce a \u201cmilder\u201d sepsis that caused much lower mortality (Mild CLP). Animals that had laparotomy and cecal manipulation without ligation or puncture were included in the sham laparotomy group (Sham). Another group of animals had CLP and treatment with a standard antibiotic regimen for mouse abdominal sepsis: IP ceftriaxone 6.4 mg/kg and metronidazole 3.5 mg/kg, delivered 1, 12, and 24 hours after CLP (CLP + antibiotics group).23 To induce severe systemic inflammation without infection, IP injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotype 0111:B4 20 mg/kg (Sigma, Inc) was performed (LPS group).24 The dose of LPS (20 mg/kg) was used because it reliably produces death over several days in the animals; smaller doses in pilot experiments tended to produce morbidity without mortality. Mice injected IP with normal saline vehicle (Saline group) acted as the concurrent control group for LPS treatment. The census of surviving mice was recorded at 24-hour intervals for 7 days. In a separate cohort, mice were sacrificed at 24 hours after injury by cervical dislocation under halothane general anesthesia. The 24-hours time point after injury was chosen because pilot experiments showed that the ability to distinguish between spleen expression profiles was greater at 24 hours than at 48 or 72 hours after injury.25 Whole spleen tissue from eight CLP and eight Sham mice was harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. In another cohort of animals, intracardiac blood from eight animals per group was pooled using the PAXgene Blood RNA System to derive total RNA from whole blood (PreAnalytiX GmbH). While 5 GeneChips from blood for each of the seven groups were prepared, there were a total of 35 mouse blood GeneChips from 280 animals: 28 GeneChips were in the training data set and 7 GeneChips were in the test (de-identified) data set.",

Differentially expressed genes were identified using a mixed-model ANOVA and linear contrasts. We next determined whether it was possible to accurately distinguish tissue samples resulting from models of sterile systemic inflammation or models of systemic infection in human spleen, mouse spleen, and mouse blood. To produce unbiased estimates of prediction accuracy while also optimizing the set of predictor genes, classifier type, and classifier parameters, we used a two-level, nested cross-validation procedure that produces prediction estimates that are not biased by gene, classifier, and parameter selection. This procedure makes use of an \u201couter\u201d cross-validation to produce the estimate of accuracy, and an \u201cinner\u201d cross-validation to perform classifier and gene selection.27 For class prediction, we compared k-nearest neighbor, nearest centroid, and linear and quadratic discriminant analysis classifiers. Two complementary programs were used to query regulatory networks: PathwayAssist (Ariadne Genomics) and Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems). Both PathwayAssist and Pathway Analysis use the published literature or publicly available databases to identify relationships between genes, small molecules, or other objects. This information in turn is used to map de novo, putative, interaction networks from a given list of input gene identifiers. See Supplementary Information for additional details.",

Differences in apparent gene expression between the Sepsis and Injury (control) phenotypes were used to construct a classifier, the accuracy estimate of which was 67.1%. This small, exploratory clinical study provided \u201cbedside\u201d proof of feasibility using human transcriptional profiles to model the septic phenotype, but also demonstrated a large degree of variance in gene expression between subjects, because of both technical and biologic differences. To control more of this variance we moved from the bedside to the bench, performing a systematic examination of the diagnostic potential of spleen and blood gene expression profiling in inbred mice. Consistent with the human data, spleen samples from mice after CLP exhibited microarray patterns that could be modeled to predict the septic phenotype. The nested cross-validation accuracy estimate of 96.0% for sepsis prediction using mouse spleen was considerably better than that found using human spleen, likely because of the mouse experimental design that exploited fresh tissues and identical age, gender, and genotype across subjects. Because the clinical use of gene expression analysis using splenic tissue is severely limited, we explored next the use of circulating blood for class prediction in our mouse models. The combined accuracy of the predictions for any-CLP versus non-CLP and LPS versus controls was high at 94.4% and 93.2%, respectively. The accuracy estimate for distinguishing between the high and low mortality CLP groups (CLP versus Mild CLP and CLP plus antibiotics) at this 24-hour time point was much less at 62.4%. These conclusions are consistent with the PCA analysis in Figure 4, in which we sought differences in apparent gene expression across the seven experimental groups. Interestingly, the only samples that were cluster outliers were in the CLP plus antibiotics group, consistent with an effect of antibiotics to change the septic phenotype toward the control phenotypes. We conclude that circulating blood gene expression profiles can be used to predict CLP and non-CLP phenotypes in prospective cohorts, in particular, distinguishing controls from lethal endotoxicosis (LPS) from lethal infection (CLP). It is important to note that at this 24-hour time point, there were no substantial differences between LPS or any of the CLP groups in clinical presentation or complete blood counts. Microarray analysis could make the diagnosis of sepsis (distinguishing between sterile and infectious sources of systemic inflammation) when clinical criteria and white blood cell counts could not, a frequent occurrence in ICUs.33 In addition, the differences between groups as measured by absolute fold-changes in individual gene expression were small (eg, in the final model for blood, 86.4% of genes were altered less than twofold), yet the changes in the patterns of expression across hundreds of genes were robust predictors of phenotype.",

Nine genes were commonly increased, validated across two tissue types (spleen and blood) and two insults (CLP and LPS). In contrast, there were no genes that were commonly decreased. Given that this list of nine genes was based on changes in relative RNA abundance across a number of cell types, the network analysis performed served as an exploratory tool, validating in silico the role of six of nine genes in canonical pathways for inflammation, apoptosis, and signal transduction: inhibitor of DNA binding 2, calgranulin A and B, interferon regulatory factor 7, lipocalin 2, and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (Table 4). Several characteristics of these nine common inflammatory response genes are notable. Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 is required for normal mouse immune development, especially of lymph nodes and Peyer\u2019s patches.34 Calgranulin A and B, which belong to a recently described group of proinflammatory molecules, form extracellular complexes that bind to and activate endothelial cells, promoting chemotaxis and phagocytic adhesion in a positive feedback manner.35, 36 Interferon regulatory factor 7 is a key regulatory of monocyte development, essential to differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.37 Lipocalin 2 is a secreted protein that undergoes transcriptional induction after cytokine withdrawal and induces leukocyte-specific apoptosis.38 Lipocalin 2 transcription, translation, and secretion are induced by ligation of Toll-like receptors on leukocytes, with secreted lipocalin 2 acting to sequester siderophores, thereby limiting bacterial growth.39 Formyl peptide receptor-like 1 is a member of the chemoattractant subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that are involved in controlling leukocyte migration.40 The other two annotated genes not listed in the network, neutrophilic granule protein and serum amyloid A3, have also been associated with inflammation and cellular defense, although less is known about their functions and protein interactions. Neutrophilic granule protein is a cysteine protease inhibitor that has been associated with myeloid differentiation.41 Serum amyloid A3 is a high-density apolipoprotein, the only amyloid made by both hepatocytes and peripheral monocytes and macrophages.42 It is believed to function by retargeting transported lipids, including cholesterol, in the disposal of toxins.42 The function of the ninth gene, a retroviral species that is increased in a number of different models of infection and inflammation, is not known.",

Nevertheless, the data from these patients have proved invaluable for the study of immune dysfunction in human sepsis2 and provided proof-of-principle here that molecular profiles of human lymphoid tissues could be used to distinguish between septic and nonseptic phenotypes. Because cellular populations of mammalian tissues are heterogeneous, use of microarray profiles to study the cellular response to a given stimulus must be understood in the context of changes in cell populations. This substantially limits conclusions about whole spleen data, given our reports and those of others that sepsis accelerates splenocyte apoptosis.2, 19, 44 In contrast, changes in blood cellular heterogeneity are measured routinely. Although CLP and LPS stimuli changed both absolute WBCs and cell differentials compared with the controls, among the four groups of \u201csick\u201d animals cell counts were indistinguishable (Fig. 2). This mirrors the clinical situation where differentiating between sterile (LPS) and infectious (any-CLP) sources of systemic inflammation is not possible based on clinical grounds or cell counts.

Importantly, we observed that the magnitude of change in gene expression that was needed to predict the septic phenotype was very small. It was the pattern of these small changes in expression that were predictive, not the magnitude of any single change. We and others reported recently validated clinical protocols for blood gene expression profiling used to characterize the human systemic inflammatory response.13, 14 The data presented here suggest that these protocols should be extended to clinical trials, testing the efficacy of microarray gene expression profiling to diagnose human sepsis. We expect that these studies will provide new insight into how specific pathogens uniquely perturb the physiology of circulating leukocytes and how the host successfully mounts pathogen-specific defenses.",
