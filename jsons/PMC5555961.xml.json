            "text": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition with the acute onset of noncardiac respiratory failure that develops in response to a series of insults to the alveolar-capillary barrier [1]. The current mainstay therapy for ARDS is largely supportive [2, 3]. This has been shown to reduce mortality by limiting further iatrogenic injury to the already injured lungs. However, the mortality rate of ARDS is still unacceptably high [4]. ARDS is largely caused by the local alveolar and circulating \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that happens with bacterial/virus infection, burn/trauma and some possible iatrogenic factors, such as high-volume ventilation [5]. This has encouraged the development of several specific targeted pharmacologic therapy directed against single key pathogenic mediators. However, most clinical trials have proven no benefit to disease outcome and were stopped early for futility [6]. Investigators shifted their interests into the extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modality, which is a nonspecific, broad-spectrum method to blunt the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d by immediately clearing a series of circulating and resident mediators [7].",

Also, it has been shown that hemoadsorption (HA), another modality of EBP, can improve oxygenation in septic patients [10, 11]. However, evidences of HA\u2019s effects on ARDS patients animal models are scarce. We hypothesize that HA can improve oxygenation, reduce the permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier and alleviate pulmonary edema/damage by blunting the circulating/alveolar cytokines in the process of ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we established an endotoxin-induced ARDS porcine model to explore HA\u2019s therapeutic effect by using a HA330 resin cartridge (a new weapon against cytokine storm).",

Thereafter, baseline (i.e., the time point after 1-h stabilization) parameters including lung mechanics, hemodynamics, blood gases were recorded and venous blood samples were collected. As a next step, lung injury model was produced with i.v. infusion of 50 \u03bcg/kg LPS (Escherichia coli, serotype O55:B5, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) mixed in 500 ml of saline that was delivered via a volumetric infusion pump (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA, USA) for about 2 h [12, 13]. Before the start of the experiment, 24 animals were purchased and randomly divided into four groups according to different conditions: (a) control group (N = 6), animals received an i.v. infusion of saline without LPS (LPS-sham); (b) LPS group (N = 6), animals received an i.v. infusion of saline with LPS as indicated above. When experimental ARDS was diagnosed in LPS group (PaO2/FiO2 is equal or less than 200 mmHg with a PEEP equal to 5 cmH2O), animals in control and LPS group were all killed for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and histologic assessment in order to aid further diagnosis of lung injury. (c) LPS plus HA-sham group (N = 6), animals received an i.v. infusion of saline with LPS. Immediately after ARDS was well established, HA-sham treatment was started by using a hollow fiber membrane hemofilter (Fresenius) with the ultrafiltration line clamped. Two animals in this group were excluded because they died or developed severe sepsis/septic shock and refractory acidosis despite active liquid recovery and vasopressor administration before moderate ARDS diagnosis; (d) LPS plus HA group (N = 6), animals received an i.v. infusion of saline with LPS, and real HA treatment was started by using a disposable hemoperfusion cartridge (HA330 resin, styrene divinylbenzene copolymers, with a blood flow of 200\u2013250 ml/min, volume of 185 ml; Jafron Biomedical Co., Ltd., Zhuhai, GuangDong, China; http://www.jafron.com/). Two pigs were also discarded because they died of septic shock and severe disturbance of water, electrolyte and acid base before the establishment of hemoperfusion circulation. HA-sham and HA treatment lasted for 3 h, and thereafter, the animals were monitored for an extended observation period of 5 h and then killed with a bolus injection of 10 ml of 15% KCl. BAL fluid collection and lung tissue harvesting were performed immediately upon exsanguination and sternotomy performance for the measurements of inflammatory markers, proteomes and for histologic evaluation. Parameters of hemodynamics, blood gases and lung mechanics were recorded every hour following the start of LPS or sham LPS infusion until the end of experiment. Plasma samples were also prepared in the corresponding time points. During the experiment, all pigs were continuously infused with Ringer lactate solution or saline at a rate of 12 ml/kg/h at the start of the experiment. The infusion rate was increased to 15\u201320 ml/kg/h if the MAP was less than 70\u201350 mmHg. However, if pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) continuously raised and exceeded 12 mmHg, the rate of infusion should be reduced to prevent fluid overload. Meanwhile, norepinephrine (0.5\u20131.5 \u03bcg/kg/min) was then used to achieve this level of mPAP in LPS-treated pigs. Body temperature was maintained over 36 \u00b0C by using a heating blanket. The experimental protocol was summarized in Additional file 2: Fig. S1.",

In parallel, there was also a remarkable increase in lung wet/dry ratio in LPS-challenged pigs compared with saline group (Fig. 1h). The alveolar-capillary membrane was also seriously injured by LPS infusion as manifested by a significant increase in both pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) and whole BAL protein concentration (Fig. 1f, g). Infusion of LPS in the endotoxin challenge group was also associated with an increase in the numbers of whole BAL cell counting (Fig. 1i). To determine the histopathological features of ALI model, subset of animals (N = 6 in LPS and saline group, respectively) were killed when ARDS model was diagnosed based on oxygenation parameter (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 200 mmHg at PEEP = 5 cmH2O). Histologic examinations from animals receiving LPS demonstrated alveolar bleeding, microatelectasis, perivascular edema, marked leukocyte sequestration in alveolar septa and lumen, thickened alveolar walls, and the presence of proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space as compared to control subjects (Fig. 1j\u2013l, Additional file 4: Fig. S2).",

To reproduce the most known risk factor and etiology for ARDS, which is sepsis [18], we systemically administrated endotoxin (LPS) to mimic the clinically relevant sepsis-induced ARDS. The susceptibility to LPS is highly variable and differs among different animals. Pigs, sheep, calves, and cats are more sensitive to LPS challenge. Low dosage of LPS (\u03bcg/kg range) can induce significant ARDS-like features in these animals. In contrast, animals such as rodents or dogs require much higher doses to develop lung injury (mg/kg range). This different vulnerability to LPS may be induced by the pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIM), a lung resident population of mature macrophage [19]. 8\u2013100 \u03bcg/kg of LPS has been used in several previous studies to develop porcine ARDS model [12, 20, 21]. In our study, low amount of LPS (50ug/kg in 500 ml saline for 2 h) can also induce the pigs to develop an abrupt decrease in oxygenation and arterial pressure and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, needing rapid fluid resuscitation (10\u201320 ml/kg/h of saline) and the usage of vasopressor infusion (0.5\u20131.5 \u03bcg/kg/min of norepinephrine).",

            "text": "In most recent large-animal studies, the diagnosis of experimental ARDS is ambiguous without definite criteria [12, 18, 21, 22]. To determine whether ARDS really occurred, we adopt the four diagnostic criteria released by ATS official statement on the definition of ARDS in animals [14]. ARDS model was initially diagnosed when PaO2/FiO2 is less than 200 mmHg with a PEEP at 5 cmH2O (criteria (a) moderate ARDS in human beings according to Berlin definition). Then, the ARDS model was further assessed with other criteria listed as follows: (b) permeability. Permeability assessment was performed by using four parameters, i.e., EVLWI, PVPI, BALF protein and the ratio of wet to dry lung weight (W/D ratio). EVLW is the amount of interstitial and alveolar fluid [23]. Previous studies showed that EVLW indexed to body weight (EVLWI) is well correlated with the value obtained by gravimetry and can independently predict mortality in septic and ARDS patients [19]. We found that both EVLWI and W/D ratio were significantly increased after LPS infusion, indicating an exudative edema phase (Fig. 1; Table 2). The permeability of lung epithelium barrier can also be calculated by PVPI [24]. PVPI in this model was increased to 5.6 \u00b1 0.5 at T0 when ARDS was diagnosed (Fig. 1; Table 2), indicating high permeable (rather than hydrostatic) pulmonary edema because it was reported that a PVPI value of 3 can distinguish these two forms of pulmonary edema [24]. Accordingly, BALF protein concentration, another leakage marker [14], was also increased after LPS infusion (Fig. 1g). (c) Histology. To our knowledge, this is the first large-animal study to assess histologic changes at the time point that ARDS was initially diagnosed by oxygenation and ahead of therapy implementation. The major histologic findings are shown in Fig. 1j\u2013l. It is noteworthy that LPS i.v. infusion causes only modest lung edema (perivascular edema, Additional file 4: Fig. S2) as compared to ARDS patients, because the endothelium barrier is more resistant to the damage induced by LPS [19]. (d) Inflammation. We found that both circulating and alveolar inflammatory cytokines were elevated, indicating an acute \u201ccytokine storm\u201d was elicited in systemic and lung milieu by i.v. infusion of LPS.",

            "text": "Thereafter, we conducted subsequent studies to explore the \u201ctherapeutic,\u201d rather than \u201cprophylactic\u201d effect of hemoadsorption (HA) on the well-established (or far-developed, rather than \u201cimmature\u201d) ARDS model. HA was performed with the HA330 neutral microporous resin cartridge specially designed for the absorption of medium-sized inflammatory cytokines. First, we found that HA treatment increased PaO2/FiO2 gradually (Fig. 3). Several previous studies in septic patients attributed this beneficial effect to the improved hemodynamics [10, 25]. However, a previous experimental study showed that zero-balanced high-volume continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) could improve arterial oxygenation without systemic or pulmonary hemodynamics improvement [9]. We also found that animals treated with or without HA330-based hemadsorption did not differ in their levels of MAP, SVRI, MPAP and PVRI (Table 4). Considering that HA therapy elicited a trend in reducing lung water and the permeability of alveolar-capillary membrane barrier (Fig. 3e\u2013i), we assume that oxygenation improvement should be partly due to the reduction of alveolar fluid leakage after clearing the peak concentration of alveolar cytokines, corresponding with the \u201cpeak concentration hypothesis\u201d for EBP modality [26]. Lung local cytokines removal may be the result of passive spillover or active transport [26]. Notably, a recent clinical study showed that the circulating and BALF levels of IL-17A were significantly increased in ARDS patients and predicted an increased influx of alveolar neutrophils, alveolar permeability and organ dysfunction [27]. Thus, reduced BALF level of IL-17A in HA treatment group may be one of the reasons for fewer lung inflammatory cells and decreased acute lung injury. Taken together, by direct/indirect removal of a variety of pathogenic proinflammatory mediators that over-expressed in plasma and lung, HA timely blunted the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d in the process of ARDS and restored immunologic balance at a much lower set-point. These findings were in line with a recent small clinical study on septic-induced ARDS patients [28].",

            "text": "In the last step, we also examined whether HA can effect the whole proteomes in plasma and lung, which has not been previously reported. We found four plasma proteins that were most differentially regulated by HA and HA-sham therapy, i.e., IL-1Ra, MMP-1, MMP-10 and ITIH4 (Fig. 5a, b). Soluble IL-1Ra, an important member in IL-1 family of cytokines [29], was dramatically elevated in ARDS and septic patients [30, 31]. A persistent elevated level of IL-1Ra indicates immunoparalysis, which greatly contributes to the later deaths who survive the initial cytokine storm in ARDS [32]. ITIH4 is a plasma glycoprotein that belongs to a serine protease inhibitor family and acts as an acute-phase protein in several diseases [33]. However, there is a lack of studies aiming to determine the role of ITIH4 as a potential diagnostic or prognostic indicator for ARDS. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes with the capacity of degrading the extracellular matrix component, thus causing tissue damage in the pathological process [34]. Previous studies were largely focused on the BAL fluid level of MMPs (including MMP2, MMP8 and MMP9) and found an elevated expression pattern [35]. However, the circulating and BALF levels of MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) and MMP-10 (Stromeolysin 2) in ARDS animals or patients are remained largely unknown. Collectively, we concluded a composite of plasma biomarkers with IL-1Ra, MMPs and ITIH4 may be useful to predict the severity of ARDS. Of course, this hypothesis needs further verification.",

Notably, we found that the BALF level of secreted histone H2A, H2B and H4 was significantly blunted after HA therapy compared with HA-sham-treated pigs. Extracellular histones are the constituent of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) structures that ensnare and kill bacteria [36]. Elevated extracellular histones in BALF samples from humans with ARDS have been reported [37]. Also, instillation of neutralizing anti-histone H2A/H4 antibody reduced experimental ARDS severity [38]. Because extracellular histones origin from actively secretion by activated inflammatory cells, or from passively release by necrotic cells, we concluded that HA can significantly reduced the BALF level of histones by attenuating inflammatory lung injuries. BALF and lung level of Surfactant protein (SP)-B and SP-C were also significantly up-regulated by HA versus HA-sham treatment. Previous studies showed decreased levels of SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in BALF of ARDS patients [39]. Thus, HA treatment may improve oxygenation by restoring the alveolar levels of surfactant proteins. Collectively, we showed with the first experience that HA330-directed HA performance has a profound impact on plasma and lung proteome in a sepsis-induced ARDS porcine model.",

This is a small sample animal study. Also, the effect of HA330 directed HA should be further tested by other ARDS models.
