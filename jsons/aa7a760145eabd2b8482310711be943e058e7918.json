Gauthier et al. (1989) have suggested that the diagnostic criteria of the CDC be reassessed, as it is now believed that Reye's Syndrome may actually be two distinct disease entities, with the infantile form (i.e., in children less than 2-3 yr of age) attributable to the unmasking of an inborn error of metabolism, a group of diseases that include the organic acidemias, urea cycle defects, and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) (Taubman et al., 1987; Greene et al., 1988; Roe, 1988) . The \"unmasking\" may be a response to a specific illness, or to any disorder that limits caloric intake, and results in a disease that in many ways resembles RS. Factors that may distinguish inborn errors from RS include normal ammonia levels at presentation, a very short period between onset of initiating illness and pernicious vomiting, and lack of signs of increased intracranial pressure.",

Death, if it occurs, is usually owing to a severe brain edema in which the cerebral cortex has swollen to the extent that it becomes necrotic up against the nonyielding cranial vault (Venes et al., 1978) . The swelling leads to increased intracranial pressure and altered cerebral perfusion (McWilliam and Stephenson, 1985; Frewen and Kisson, 1987) . It is not known whether the edema is cytotoxic or vasogenic. The extensive histopathological studies of Partin et al. (1978) and others (Venes et al., 1978) have shown that there is an increase in the number and size of astrocytes, and that they are often devoid of glycogen granules. Of particular interest is the fact that astrocytic mitochondria are relatively normal in structure. Depending on the severity of the disease, neurons may also be enlarged, and in contrast to the astrocytes, may contain pale, enlarged, and pleomorphic mitochondria. Capillary endothelial cells appear to be normal, with normal-appearing mitochondria, which is consistent with evidence that the blood-brain barrier is intact (Brown and Forman, 1982) . Demyelination does not appear to occur, although Partin et al. (1978) have reported the presence of watery blebs within the myelin sheaths,",

There are no outstanding abnormalities in lipid accumulation or metabolism (Brown and Forman, 1982) , and the activities of enzymes that are altered in the liver appear to be normal (Robinson et al., 1978) . Simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular vein ammonia levels indicate that the toxic metabolite is taken up in large quantities by the brain in RS patients. The excessive load of ammonia appears to be related to increased brain lactic acid production (for review, see DeLong and Glick, 1982) . Faraj and coworkers (1984) have demonstrated hypercatecholaminemia in patients with RS, and suggested that this might contribute to the encephalopathy of the disease. A recent report also indicated that CSF levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a prominent neuronal cytosolic enzyme that is released upon neuronal destruction, are elevated in RS (Nara et al., 1988) .",

            "text": "One of the consistent features of RS is that its development is associated with an antecedent viral illness involving one of several specific infecting organisms. However, since Reye's original publication in 1963, many investigators and clinicians have believed that a toxin is involved in some manner in the initiation of the disease, based on the fact that its progression resembles an acute toxic event. A wide range of exogenous toxins have been shown to produce at least some of the clinical features of RS (Pranzatelli and De Vivo, 1987) ; however, no single xenobiotic toxin or groups of toxins have been shown unequivocally to be the causative agent(s) (Cracker, 1982 (Cracker, ,1988 . Within the past several years, considerable attention has focused on salicylates as a causative agent, and declines in aspirin use and in the incidence of RS tend to support an association between the two. However, attempts to demonstrate salicylate-dependent potentiation of viral effects in animal models generally have been unsuccessful (see Section 4.5.2.). In the human disease, there is no obvious genetic predisposition, and in cases involving siblings, one might presume that the RS-like disorder is actually an inborn error of metabolism (see Section 1.2.). Many investigators, including ourselves, now believe that exposure of susceptible individuals to environmental chemicals, including salicylates, can result in an abnormal and potentially lethal response to what is normally a relatively benign virus infection (Cracker, 1982) .",

One of the primary focuses in RS research has been to determine which, if any, of these metabolites are responsible for the distinct encephalopathy of the disease. The three groups of metabolites that have been deemed the most likely candidates include ammonia, free fatty acids, and short chain organic acids, each of which is known to produce neuropathy in humans when present in excessive amounts (DeLong and Glick, 1982) . A broad discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this review, but it should be mentioned that for each of these groups there is substantial evidence against their being the sole encephalopathic factors in RS. Nevertheless, several working hypotheses have evolved from the knowledge that individuals with R!S are in a highly exaggerated catabolic state, and these have provided the basis for the development of several of the animal models described in this chapter.",

Two animal models have been based on aflatoxin toxicity: the monkey model of Bourgeois and coworkers (1971) , and the rat model of Thurlow and colleagues (1980) . The Bourgeois model involves the use of female, crab-eating macaque monkeys (Mucacufasicularis) between 36 and 44 mo of age (average body wt, 1.7 kg), that are maintained on a primate diet supplemented with fruit. For the experiment, the animals are divided into six groups (4 macaques/group), each of which is fed a different concentration (o-40.5 mg/kg) of aflatoxin B, in single-dose gelatin capsules. On the day the toxin is given, the animals are kept under constant observation and blood samples are collected at regular intervals. Bourgeois and coworkers reported that animals that receive 213.5 mg/kg begin to die 67 h following aflatoxin administration, and all are dead by 149 h. The most consistent clinical finding with this model is vomiting, which occurs in all animals that die. The animals that receive fatal doses go through a period of lethargy and depression prior to coma; however, a relatively small proportion experience convulsions. The encephalopathy is associated with increased ratios of brain:body weights, cerebral edema, swelling and separation of the myelin sheath, gliosis, and neuronal degeneration. The latter is manifested by shrinkage and increased eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, pyknosis and distortion of the Yoder et al., 1985 Deshmukhet aL, 1982 ,1983 Deshtnukhand Thomas, 1985 Cracker et aL, 1986 Taylor et al., Hug et al., 1981 'Abbreviations of enzyme activities-OTC, ormthme transcarbamylase; CPS, carbamyl phosphate synthetase; MAO, monoamine oxldase, CAT, catalase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase. 2ND, not done or not reported.

Generally, the animals rapidly become hyperammonemic, have elevated levels of 237 serum transaminases and amino acids, are hypoglycemic, and have fatty infiltration of the liver. The latter two abnormalities occur only in fasted animals, which is believed to reflect pentenoate-dependent inhibition of fatty-acid oxidation (Thayer, 1984) . Rats that are given 4-pentenoate orally do not develop hepatic fat deposits or mitochondrial structural abnormalities (Thayer, 1984) . The features that most readily distinguish this animal model from human RS are the absence of serum fatty acidemia and the fact that the animals do not experience an antecedent illness.",

Examination of the livers indicated that the endotoxin-treated rats had appreciably greater fat deposition than their fasted controls, and that the mitochondria from 6/10 of the LPS animals were pleomorphic, with expanded and disrupted matrices.

Intestinal coronavirus was the pathogen most frequently associated with the acute illness. The mice that died following a rapid deterioration in consciousness had many pathologic findings (e.g., fatty steatosis of the liver, swollen mitochondria, elevated serum ammonia) characteristic of RS. Neuropathological assessment by light microscopy indicated that there was a significant increase in the number of astrocytes in specific brain regions, and that these had swollen, pallorous nuclei reminiscent of Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis. These changes are not seen in RS. Under electron microscopy, the cytoplasm of cortical astrocytes was electron lucent and expanded, particularly in the pericapillary end-feet. There was evidence of lipid droplets and membrane-bound vacuoles, and a reduced number of glycogen particles. Astrocytic mitochondria were normal in structure. By contrast, neuronal mitochondria were swollen and contained rarified matrices and disorganized and fragmented cristae. With the exception of the Alzheimer type II astrocytic changes, these findings closely parallel those seen in the acute phase of human RS.",

Initial studies of the effects of exposing young animals to pesticides (and/or vehicle) and then infecting them withvirus demonstrated that it was the vehicle, an industrial emulsifier, rather than the pesticide, that was active in potentiating viral lethality (Cracker et al., 1974; Taylor et al., 1979) . We have now studied chemical potentiation of viral infection using several variations of this basic paradigm. The most recent and most extensively studied is a model in which neonatal mice are exposed dermally to nontoxic amounts of the emulsifier, Toximul MP8, and subsequently infected with sublethal doses of mouse-adapted human influenza B virus (FluB) (Cracker et al., 1986; Murphy et al., 1986 Murphy et al., ,1987 . The chemical/viral mouse model for RS is set up as shown in Fig. 1 . Male and female Swiss white mice (Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec) are mated at 12 wk of age in a ratio of 3 females to 1 male. The males are removed from the cages after 1 wk. Pups born on the day in which most births occur are used for the experiment, and this is considered Day 0 of the study. On Day 1, the age-matched pups are counted, pooled, and randomly distributed among the nursing mothers. Animals are housed in sets of 2 mothers with 2 litters (7-8 pups/litter) per cage. The neonates are divided into two groups, one of which is painted abdominally with Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), and the other group are painted with a 1% solution (8.9 mg/lOO mL MEM) of the industrial surfactant, Toximul Ml?8 (Tox) (Charles Tennant & Company, Toronto, Canada; Lot g-30162). For the first 5 d, the mice receive 8.6 + 2.6 mg Tax/d; this dosage is increased to 25.8 + 9.0 mg/d for the last 6 d. In a limited number of our studies, Tox was administered in a single ip injection (Cracker et al., 1986) .",

The mortality rates vary from one experiment to another; however, mice given the combined Tox plus virus treatment consistently have a higher mortality rate than those given virus alone (Cracker et al., 1986; Murphy et al., 1986) . The two aspects of this detergent + FluB model that best reflect the human disease are the selective ultrastructural damage to hepatic mitochondria (Cracker et al., 1986) , and the increases in intracranial pressure (ICI?) (Cracker et al., 1991) . Neither effect is seen in animals exposed to detergent alone; virus infection alone does not affect the mitochondria, although it does produce moderate increases in ICI?. The serum changes that are consistent with ES include hyperammonemia (also seen with detergent alone) and a decreased total lipid content (hypopanlipidemia). The livers of the combined-treat-ment mice show no evidence of inflammation or necrosis, but have significantly reduced levels of ornithine transcarbamylase activity. The features that distinguish this model from the human disease are an apparent lack of increase in serum free fatty acids and an absence of hepatic fat. There are at least two possible explanations for these discrepancies, one of which is that they occur during the earlier periods of the experiment at times when no analyses were done, or (and perhaps more likely) the synergism between the detergent and virus with respect to fat abnormalities is a species-specific phenomenon. Support for the latter of these possibilities comes from observations that there is frequently hepatic fat accumulation when the infecting virus is the native mouse pathogen, encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. In the EMC model, which has been studied by our group (Cracker et a1.,1974 (Cracker et a1., ,1976 and by others (Hug et al., 1981) ' the mice are exposed to either Toximul (our studies) or to Atlox 3409 F (ICI America Inc., Wilmington, DE) (Hug et al., 1981) , and subsequently inoculated ip with the virus in amounts that are titemd to produce a 30-50% mortality rate. Deaths generally occur between 24 d following inoculation In addition to developing fatty liver, the mice treated with EMC and detergent have several other hepatic changes consistent with RS (e.g., mitochondrial structural abnormalities and enzymatic changes).",

We have obtained preliminary data confirming the presence of 1,2-dibromoethane (a derivatized byproduct of Toximul) in mouse and human livers, and in human brain samples (Cracker et al., 1985) but we have not done a large number of analyses. An important question is whether death results from the lung infection or whether an encephalopathy is involved. The lungs of the mice are infected, and virus can be recovered from them; however, data concerning CNS involvement have been difficult to obtain from such a small animal. In recent studies in which we measured ICI? using a scaled-down method described for cats, we found that the mice treated with detergent plus FluB had significantly elevated values for ICP (Cracker et al., 1991) .
