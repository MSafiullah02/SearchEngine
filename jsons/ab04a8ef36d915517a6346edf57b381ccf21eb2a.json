Five typical open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ORF1ab polyprotein (7096 amino acids), spike glycoprotein (1273 amino acids), envelope protein (75 amino acids), membrane protein (222 amino acids), and nucleocapsid protein (419 amino acids).

In this method, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA is first reverse transcribed into cDNA, and specific gene fragments within the cDNA are amplified using targetspecific primers. The fluorescence signal, which represents the copy number of the target sequence, can be easily detected during the amplification process. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended to use 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and 2019-nCoV_N3 primers and probes that target the nucleocapsid gene, 5 whereas the Chinese CDC recommended to use the ORF1ab and nucleocapsid primers as the targets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. 6 Real-time RT-PCR is specific, rapid, and economical; however, by using this approach we cannot precisely analyze the NA sequence of the amplified gene fragments, and thus all the target fragments that are successfully amplified are considered to be positive. In addition to these limitations, sample preparation, laboratory conditions, and technical errors can lead to false-negative results. Also, several reports have revealed false-negative results obtained by using real-time RT-PCR kits. Besides, testing for viral NAs using this method must be carried out only by experienced technicians in qualified laboratories, making its practical applications by clinicians limited.",

At the initial step, this method involves the amplification of several SARS-CoV-2specific gene fragments. These targets were chosen based on the virulence genes and were not limited to sites currently recommended by the Chinese and the U.S. CDCs, allowing us to enhance the sensitivity of this novel assay. We then used the nanopore platform to perform the sequencing of the amplified fragments. Thus, the nanopore platform can sequence as well as analyze the results simultaneously, further allowing us to confirm whether the tested sample possess SARS-CoV-2 within a few minutes (at the fast speed) after sequencing. The results of this experiment revealed the detailed NA sequences and can thus reflect whether the virulence genes were mutated during the spread of the virus, thereby providing substantial information for further epidemiological analysis. To detect the presence of other respiratory viruses causing infections in patients, we added multiple characteristic primers for amplification of common respiratory viruses including conventional coronavirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, influenza C virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and boca virus. Therefore, this single NTS assay is capable of comprehensively and simultaneously analyzing and diagnosing various types of viral infections.",

The output signal represses translation by sequestering the ribosomal binding site (RBS) of the transducer RNA within a hairpin. This hairpin is unwound upon binding of a cognate trigger RNA, exposing the RBS and enabling the translation of the downstream protein.",
