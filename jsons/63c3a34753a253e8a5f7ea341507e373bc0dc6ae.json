In our investigation, 62.5 % of the farms were contaminated with I. suis. Otten et al. (1996) and Meyer et al. (1999) reported an I. suis prevalence of 100 % in Germany, Roberts and Walker (1982) of 78 % in Great Britain and Eyskers et al. (1994) one of 68 % in the Netherlands. Besides I. suis, Eimeria spp. were also found frequently in these pig production units. However, Eimeria spp. are shed more frequently from sows than from piglets (Lindsay et al., 1984; Nilsson et al., 1984) . Stuart et al. (1982) postulate that older animals develop a lifelong immunity against I. suis. According to Tubbs (1986) , passive immunity acquired via the colostrum protects piglets against Eimeria infections during the \u00aerst weeks of life. In contrast, the lactogenic immunity against I. suis is insuf\u00aecient. In addition, the short pre-patency (5\u00b16 days) compared to that of Eimeria spp. and the short sporulation time of I. suis cause higher concentrations of infectious I. suis stages in the litters (Tubbs, 1986) . These considerations are con\u00aermed by the high prevalence of I. suis (20.9 %) and the low prevalence of Eimeria spp. (0.7 %) detected in the present study. The highest prevalences for I. suis were observed in the second and third weeks of life. These data correspond to, and thus con\u00aerm, \u00aendings from earlier investigations (Henriksen and Christensen, 1989; Henriksen, 1991) . In general I. suis appears to be the most prevalent enteropathogen of young piglets, as was also shown by studies in the USA (Bergeland and Henry, 1982; Lindsay et al., 1984; Biehl and Hoe\u00afing, 1986; Fitzgerald et al., 1988) , Canada (Morin et al., 1983) , Australia (Driesen et al., 1993 3 ), Great Britain (Roberts and Walker, 1982) , Sweden (Nilsson, 1988) , Italy (Trotti et al., 1987) and Germany (Otten et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 1999) . Guscetti (1991) examined both healthy piglets and those with diarrhoea for the shedding of I. suis, and found a difference in the prevalence of 61 % to 4.3 %, respectively.

Higher prevalences have only been reported if older animals were investigated (Sanford, 1987; Otten et al., 1996) . Oocysts of C. parvum are frequently isolated from healthy piglets (Villacorta et al., 1991; Otten et al., 1996) and C. parvum is therefore not regarded as an obligate pathogen for piglets (Sanford, 1987) .

The weaners, at least, were old enough also to shed eggs of other nematodes such as Ascaris suum or Oesophagostomum spp. Clearly more data are needed on a broader scale to gain evidence as to whether the situation has changed generally, possibly due to improved hygiene standards, or not.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 195, "text": "(Bergeland and Henry, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 196, "end": 216, "text": "Trotti et al., 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 217, "end": 231, "text": "Sanford, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 232, "end": 256, "text": "Villacorta et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 257, "end": 276, "text": "Otten et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 357, "end": 372, "text": "(Sanford, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 373, "end": 392, "text": "Otten et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 461, "end": 486, "text": "(Villacorta et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 487, "end": 506, "text": "Otten et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 583, "end": 598, "text": "(Sanford, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 810, "end": 830, "text": "(Indermu \u00c8hle, 1978;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 831, "end": 852, "text": "Morris et al., 1984 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 855, "end": 874, "text": "Otten et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1134, "text": "(Ho \u00c8rchner et al., 1980;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1161, "text": "Muss and Hasslinger, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1181, "text": "Otten et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Studies describing the prevalences of coronaviruses and rotaviruses in faecal samples of piglets with diarrhoea have been published only rarely and the data published varied widely.

In particular, ETEC were shed by weaned piglets preferentially (42.7 %). In suckling piglets, the prevalences were lower and they decreased from 9.5 to 5.6 % between the \u00aerst and third weeks of life. To our knowledge, a similar low level prevalence (7.4 %) has so far only been reported by Guscetti (1991) . In most of the studies published previously the prevalences in suckling piglets ranged between 30 and 50 % (Bergeland and Henry, 1982; Morin et al., 1983; Biehl and Hoe\u00afing, 1986; Evans et al., 1986; Nakazawa et al., 1987; Fitzgerald et al., 1988; Driesen et al., 1993) . In piglets with diarrhoea, isolation rates even reached 88.6 % (Nagy et al., 1990) . Since most of these high prevalences were measured more than 10 years ago, the low prevalence detected in our study is presumably due to the increasing use of ETEC vaccines in pregnant sows during the last years. In agreement with the results of Wilson and Francis (1986) , ST-I-positive ETEC were found more frequently than LT-I-positive strains in suckling piglets. However, the \u00aending that LT-I-positive ETEC strains are highly prevalent in weaned piglets has not been observed previously (Moon et al., 1986; Nakazawa et al., 1987; Ojeniyi et al., 1992; Wray et al., 1993) .

Since the procedures of sampling, transport to the diagnostic laboratory and analyses of the samples were to a large extent optimized, one must assume that either a large proportion of the cases was caused by non-infectious factors or that currently unknown pathogens were involved. However, the latter is unlikely, since a much broader spectrum of microbiological pathogens is detectable with the diagnostic techniques applied.
