And yet we are failing them in almost every way. What kind of mental space do you have to be in not to see this? I will never forget the images of ER personnel cutting holes in 50-gallon trashbags and putting them on because they didn't have enough proper PPE gear. The only thing comparable is going into combat knowing you might be killed or crippled in some way that would dominate the rest of your life and doing it anyway. That is real heroism.

If you stress a system to its limits, its strengths, but also its faults and weaknesses quickly become very apparent. Every engineer and physician knows that. Can anyone doubt that the healthcare system in the United States has been severely tested? As I have written in these pages over many years now, we do not have what I consider to be a healthcare system, because healthcare is just that. A system for fostering individual and social wellbeing which starts with health. What we call healthcare is actually an illness profit system in which the first priority is profit. It is primarily an economic system. So how has America's illness profit system performed in the pandemic of Covid-19, and treated the physicians, nurses, and other healthcare workers? I write this in the first week of April 2020, knowing that everything I know about Covid-19 and the numbers that stand for human lives will have radically changed when you read this. So think of this as report from the trail, as it were. As of today, the 5 th , there are over a million cases, 1,203,932 to be exact. There have been 64,787 deaths, and 247,301 recoveries. The U.S. now leads the world with 311,637 cases, and 8,454 deaths. We're number one, for sure.",

When assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 45.8% of physicians reported at least 1 symptom of burnout. Substantial differences in burnout were observed by specialty, with the highest rates among physicians at the front line of care access (family medicine, general internal medicine, and emergency medicine). Compared with a probability-based sample of 3442 working US adults, physicians were more likely to have symptoms of burnout (37.9% vs 27.8%) and to be dissatisfied with work-life balance (40.2% vs 23.2%) (P < .001 for both).\" 5 And since that time, the Burnout Effect has only grown worse Why do doctors feel as they do? In January 2020, another Mayo Clinic study answered the question with data: \"There were 52.3% of the hospitalists and 54.5% of the outpatient internists affected by burnout (P = 0.86). High scores on the emotional exhaustion subscale (43.8% vs 48.1%, P = 0.71) and on the depersonalization subscale (42.3% vs 32.7%, P = 0.17) were common but similar in frequency in the 2 groups. Hospitalists were more likely to score low on the personal accomplishment subscale (20.3% vs 9.6%, P = 0.04). There were no differences in symptoms of depression (40.3% for hospitalists vs 40.0% for outpatient internists, P = 0.73) or recent suicidality (9.2% vs 5.8%, P = 0.15). Rates of reported recent work-home conflict were similar (48.4% vs 41.3%, P = 0.64), but hospitalists were more likely to agree that their work schedule leaves enough time for their personal life and family (50.0% vs 42.0%, P = 0.007).\" 6 And it can be boiled down to one simple point: loss of control. The sense of being trapped in a system, where what you might like to do for a patient to foster their recovery and wellbeing will not be possible for some utterly nonmedical reason, and that you have become entrapped in a healthcare system in which profit not wellbeing is the first consideration.",

As with everything else, there are just two such corporations, Envision Health, which employs 69,000 healthcare workers nationwide, and TeamHealth employs over 20,000. And the owners of both are not medical institutions but Wall Street financiers. The private equity firm Kravis Kohlberg Roberts (KKR) owns Envision. Team Health is owned by the private equity firm, Blackstone Group. So how is it to be an employee of one of those groups? A recently retired ER physician makes it very clear, \"Work environments that are high demand and low control are most likely to lead to burnout. ER docs work for somebody else\u2026 They are pretty much at somebody else's mercy.\" 7 The Covid-19 pandemic has also brought into focus another structural weaknesses of the Illness Profit System. The PPE debacle is matched only by the lethal farce of the ventilators. Because we in the U.S. don't really have a national health system, trying to handle a national medical crisis in which hundreds of thousands, and by the time you read this perhaps millions of people come down with the same illness and require the same treatment regime, just blows what little system there is apart. And when there is no federal planning, as is the case with this crisis, everything quickly devolves into every hospital for itself. Neoliberal economics expressed medically. Which is exactly what has happened. There is no overarching plan, there is no coordinated supply network. No preparation occurred. No national effort existed to stockpile and distribute as needed the day to day materials an epidemic requires. As anyone can see the United States, the richest country on the planet, cannot even handle something as simple as getting enough protective masks for the hospital workers who risk their lives daily keeping the rest of us alive.",

We also reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.infowars.com and www.banned.video, where you direct consumers to your website, www.infowarsstore.com, to purchase your products. The FDA has determined that your www.infowarsstore.com website offers \"Superblue Silver Immune Gargle,\" \"SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste,\" \"SuperSilver Wound Dressing Gel\" and \"Superblue Fluoride Free Toothpaste\" for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19\u2026 You must immediately cease making all such claims. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction\u2026.\" 12 But Jones is small potatoes compared to what is going on in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the industry through what amount to legalized bribes as the result of Citizens United, has enormous influence in the United States Congress, America lacks the basic price controls that are in effect in most other developed nations,. How big is this lobbying effort? The investigative website, The Intercept, studied this issue, and reported, \"In 2019, the pharmaceutical industry spent $295 million on lobbying, far more than any other sector in the U.S. That's almost twice as much as the next biggest spender -the electronics, manufacturing, and equipment sector -and well more than double what oil and gas companies spent on lobbying.\" 13 Posner, who has spent years studying this issue, reported, \"Pharmaceutical companies view Covid-19 as a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity\u2026. Those lobbyists deserve a medal from their pharma clients because they killed that intellectual property provision.\" Posner added that language inserted into legislation that prohibited the government from responding to price gouging was even worse. \"To allow them to have this power during a pandemic is outrageous.\" 14 And finally, let me mention insurance. Once again, because the entire U.S. healthcare system is set up as an economic machine to make profit, studies are now coming out projecting an increase in insurance premiums by as much as 40%. That's right, almost half again more than what people are paying so that the insurance corporations can recoup what the Covid-19 pandemic is costing them. According to Covered California, the state's marketplace place analysts, \"expects that this year's care associated with the virus will cost between $34 billion and $251 billion, or between 2% of premiums and 21% of premiums. The analysis estimates that insurers would price the costs at double the rate into their 2021 premiums, projecting increases that range from as little as 4% to more than 40% for the 170 million workers and individuals who have private plans.\" 15 Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the marketplace. \"Covered California's analysis shows the impact of COVID-19 will be significant, and that absent federal action, consumers, employers and our entire health care system may be facing unforeseen costs that could exceed $251 billion. Consumers will feel these costs through higher out-of-pocket expenses and premiums, as well as the potential of employers dropping coverage or shifting more costs to employees.\" 16 So this means that even when the pandemic is over, it isn't going to be over, and hundreds of millions of Americans are going to see their monthly expenses soar. And once premiums go up, they rarely come down.",
