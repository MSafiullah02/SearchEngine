As we approach the 21st century, the progress made in controlling infections is threatened by the growing numbers of immunosuppressed individuals; the emergence of new pathogens; the reemergence of old pathogens; and the widespread resistance of organisms to antimicrobial drugs. Each development poses its own set of challenges; in combination, these developments are already undermining the efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy. There is a worldwide epidemic of immunosuppression due to malnutrition, AIDS, medical therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and organ transplantation. Immunosuppressed hosts provide ecological niches for low-virulence microorganisms [1] . In addition, antimicrobial drugs are less effective and sometimes are unable to eradicate infection in individuals with impaired immunity. Classical pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Treponema pallidum have reemerged and are difficult to treat in immunosuppressed individuals [2, 3] . The increasing frequency of drug-resistant organisms is an equally alarming development, and resistance may be developing faster than new antibiotics can be introduced [4] . For example, in one New York City hospital, the percentage of vancomycinsusceptible Enterococcus faecium decreased from 86% to 26% in 2 years [5] . The problem of resistance is not limited to bacteria; there are numerous reports of fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans [6] .",

Advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology provide new opportunities for developing antibody-based therapies. In the case of pathogens for which antimicrobial chemotherapy already exists, antibody-based therapies could be used with existing chemotherapy to improve outcome and possibly reduce the development of resistance. In the case of pathogens for which no effective chemotherapy exists, antibody-based therapies could be used for primary therapy. Given the diminishing efficacy of existing antimicrobials because of widespread resistance and the difficulties of treating infections in immunosuppressed individuals, the reintroduction of antibody-based therapies is an option that should be given serious consideration. This reintroduction would require major changes in the practice of infectious disease medicine.",

[7] [7] [8] [9] [10] Nevertheless, it was possible to treat established bacterial infections such as meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal pneumonia if antibody was administered shortly after symptoms began [7] . Antibodies functioned as direct antibacterial agents (e.g., pneumococcal antisera) or antitoxins (e.g., diphtherial antisera). Nonphysiological and nontherapeutic animal models of infection allowed investigators to successfully identify clinically useful antibody reagents [7] . A considerable amount of basic immunologic and microbiological research was required to develop each serum, and many fundamental discoveries were made in the search for better sera.

Treatment with type-specific serum reduced the mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia from 30%-40% to 10%-20% [7] , whereas the mortality rate among patients treated with sulfonamide was 7% [48] . Serum therapy reduced the mortality rate of erysipelas from 10% to 7% [37] , whereas the mortality rate for patients treated with sulfonamides was 1%-2% [49] . For meningococcal meningitis, the efficacy of serum depended on the epidemic. In the mid-1930s, Waghelstein [50] reported that the mortality rate for patients with meningococcal meningitis who were treated at Sydenham Hospital (Baltimore, MD) with sulfonamide was 15.3% and for those treated with serum it was 27%. In controlled trials, the superiority of chemotherapy over serum therapy was lessevident. For example, the mortality among patients with meningococcal meningitis who were treated early with adequate serum therapy was 16.7% vs. 11.6% for sulfanilamide therapy [50] . The mortality among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia treated with antimicrobial drugs or serum was 11% and 16.7%, respectively, but there was no difference in the mortality rates among younger ..",

The finding that sulfonamides made pneumococci more susceptible to antibody-mediated phagocytosis supported the idea of combination therapy [58] . It was similarly recognized that sulfonamides, unlike antibody, did not neutralize bacterial toxins or modify the course of disease caused by diphtheria or tetanus toxins [59] . Combination therapy was recommended for scarlet fever [60] , pneumococcal pneumonia [44, 54, 61] , whooping cough [20] and meningitis due to pneumococcus [8, 62] , meningococcus [8, 50, 63, 64] , or H. influenzae [8] .

In contrast to polyclonal sera, mAbs are homogeneous and reproducible reagents that can be generated in large amounts. Generation of mAbs from mice and rats is still easier and more efficient than production of human mAbs. However, several technologies are available for the humanization of murine mAbs and generation of human mAbs [97] . Mouse-human chimeric antibodies can be constructed by linking the genes expressing the mouse variable region to human constant region genes [97] . The result is a molecule that is mostly human and has a longer half-life than the murine precursor [98] . As an alternative, the antigen binding regions of murine mAbs can be grafted into human antibody frameworks by molecular techniques [97] , resulting in molecules that are almost completely human in origin. Other strategies to generate human antibodies are the transformation of human B cells, the generation ofrecombinant antibody libraries from human B cells, and the use of transgenic mice that have the human immunoglobulin locus.",

            "text": "Recent Setbacks for mAb-Based Therapies: Historical Perspective Clinical trials of antiendotoxin mAbs for gram-negative sepsis have produced inconclusive results [99, 100] . When the difficulties encountered in developing antiendotoxin mAb strategies are considered in the context of the development of serum therapy, they do not seem unusual or unexpected. For example, passive protection with pneumococcal antisera was demonstrated in 1891 by the Klemperers [101] , but 30-40 years elapsed before serum therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was widely accepted. For pneumococcal antiserum therapy to be consistently successful, several developments were necessary. These included the appreciation of antigenic variation in pneumococci [102] , the need for type-specific sera [103] , the development of rapid in vitro assays to establish antigenic type (i.e., capsular swelling and agglutination reactions) [104] , the development of methods to standardize potency (mouse protection test) [46] , and improved purification techniques that would reduce the toxicity of serum. For meningococcal antisera the situation was reversed; Flexner's serum significantly reduced mortality in early epidemics of meningitis [38] but was subsequently less effective, possibly as a result of antigenic changes in Neisseria meningitidis [7] . Research into better meningococcal antisera was then hampered by the lack of useful animal models, loss of strain virulence in vitro, and poor understanding of the antigenic diversity of N meningitidis [105, 106] . A lesson from the preantibiotic era is that a considerable amount of basic research on the immunology and pathogenesis of each infection is usually necessary before antibody therapy can be developed that will be successful in clinical practice.",

Antibodies can modify bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral infections and are a class of biological agents with broad antimicrobial activity against diverse pathogens. Antibody-based therapies are usually pathogen-specific and have the theoretical advantage that they should not affect the normal flora of the patient or select for resistance in nontargeted microbes. Nevertheless, narrow specificity is a disadvantage because mixed infections may not be treated by a single antibody preparation. Pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae with more than one serotype was recognized as a reason for the failure of type-specific serum therapy [107] . One solution is to use cocktails of mAbs active against common antigenic types. Cocktails may be designed to include mAbs to multiple serotypes and mAbs with multiple isotypes to enhance antibody effector function. Pathogen-specific drugs (such as mAbs) are less attractive to the pharmaceutical industry because the narrow specificity reduces the potential market for the drug. However, the increasing incidence of resistant organisms resulting from the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens could make pathogen-specific drugs attractive to drug companies. Precedents for the development of pathogen-specific drugs already exist in the area of antiviral drug research.",

Antibody therapy has the potential to enhance immune function in immunosuppressed hosts. However, since the mechanism of action of many antibodies involves promoting microbial clearance through nonspecific cellular immunity, antibody-based therapies may be less effective in individuals with defective macrophage, neutrophil, and natural killer cell function. In this regard, it is encouraging that antibodies are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in neutropenic mice [109] and that they can reduce the number of infections in pediatric patients with AIDS [79] .",

Heterologous mAbs (i.e., murine mAbs) have shorter half-lives in humans, but chimeric and humanized mAbs have longer half-lives than their murine precursors. mAbs with a longer half-life can, in principle, be engineered by altering the regions of the constant domain that regulate clearance.",

However, in infections of the brain in which there is inflammation, there is increased antibody penetration, and intravenous administration of antibodies appears to have been successfully used for therapy of meningococcal meningitis [115] . Antibodybased therapies can also be administered directly into the subarachnoid space, as has been done for the treatment ofmeningococcal and H. influenzae meningitis [8, 38] . Enhanced penetration of the brain can be achieved by modifying the charge of the molecule [116] or by linking it to carrier proteins that cross the blood-brain barrier [117] . Antibody therapy for brain infections may be feasible if the blood-brain barrier is leaky, if antibody is administered directly into the subarachnoid space, or if antibodies with greater brain penetration are used. Additional research into the pharmacokinetics of antibodies in infection is likely to be required for optimal use of antibody-based therapies.

This could be minimized by antigenic surveillance systems, as is presently done for influenza virus. Antibody-resistant mutants can be generated in the laboratory [129] , and it is likely that the same can occur in patients. Mechanisms of antibody resistance include mutations that change the antigenic site and protease production. Antibody use may select for antigenically distinct variants. Evidence for the horizontal transfer of IgA protease genes exists in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and it is conceivable that widespread antibody use would result in selection of protease-producing strains for many pathogens [130] . Thus, large-scale use of antibody-based therapies may result in rapid emergence of antibody resistance in a manner analogous to that of antibiotic resistance. However, one advantage of antibody-based therapies is the versatility of antibody compounds. For example, emergence of an antibodyresistant strain could be countered by a new antibody directed toward the mutated epitope or another antigenic target. Emergence of protease-producing strains could be countered by designing antibodies without protease cleavage sites (although these may then be recognized as foreign and be immunogenic) or by addition of antiprotease mAbs. Selection of antibodyresistant organisms could be minimized by using cocktails of mAbs directed at multiple antigenic targets or by using a combination of antibodies and antimicrobials.",

Antibody prophylaxis for CMV infections can cost $4,000 to $9,000 per patient [71] . The cost effectiveness of antibody therapy for prevention of infection in leukemic patients has been questioned [88, 131] . However, in selected populations such as premature infants, antibody therapy may be cost effective [85] . Furthermore, the cost of a drug when first introduced may not reflect its long-term costs given the potential for improvements in technology and production. mAbs are presently made in tissue culture, so the cost of production is high. mAbs can be made in bacteria or yeast, and less costly means of production might be developed [97] . In the past, serum therapy was used despite its high cost because it was believed to be effective. New antibody-based therapies are likely to be used if they prove to be effective.",

However, administration of preformed antibodies can modify the course of cryptococcal infection in various animal models [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] , and the combination of antibody and amphotericin B is a more effective treatment than the use of either agent alone [137] [138] [139] .

For antigenically diverse pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, rapid protocols were developed for typing strains. The present practice of infectious diseases is not unlike a gambling strategy where the probability of infection by a given microbe is matched to the likelihood of activity by the available antibiotics. This has resulted in great emphasis on broad-spectrum antibiotic \"coverage\" and less emphasis on making an exact microbiological diagnosis. Although the relative merits of this practice are beyond the scope of this article, widespread antimicrobial resistance is decreasing the effectiveness of existing antibiotics, and increased caution is warranted when designing broad-spectrum combinations.",
