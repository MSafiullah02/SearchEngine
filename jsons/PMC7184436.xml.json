The office is staffed by 12 American Board of Pathology\u2013certified forensic pathologists and 33 American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators\u2013certified medicolegal death investigators, in addition to a full technical and administrative support staff. The mission of the OCME is to protect the health and safety of Oklahomans through the scientific investigation of deaths as defined by state statute, via scene investigation and postmortem examination. Examples of deaths falling under the jurisdiction of the OCME include violent deaths; deaths under suspicious, unusual, or unnatural circumstances; deaths related to disease, which might constitute a threat to public health; and deaths unattended by a licensed physician. The decedents described herein were not currently being treated by a physician and exhibited symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 at the time of death. No antemortem testing for COVID-19 had been performed. Jurisdiction was therefore assumed by the OCME, citing unattended deaths and a possible threat to public health.",

The autopsies were performed in accordance with guidelines set forth by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME)13 and the College of American Pathologists (CAP).14 Recently published guidelines for performing autopsies with suspected COVID-19 were followed.15,16 Examinations were performed in a state-of-the-art facility completed in 2018 with a negative-pressure autopsy suite and a separate negative-pressure isolation room. The examination tables used for autopsies were equipped with a reverse-flow air handling system Image 1. The examiners were clad in PPE, including N-95 masks, eye protection, disposable scrub caps, gowns, gloves, and rubber shoes or boots. Alternatively, the examiners were clad in a disposable body suit with shoe covers and 3M Versaflo powered air purifying respirators with M-series headgear (Image 1). The clothing worn under the PPE consisted of blue surgical scrub shirts and pants, which were removed before exiting the lab and laundered in-house. Shoes worn during autopsy remained in the laboratory. Shower rooms stocked with hygiene products and clean towels were available in the laboratory.",

Our observations add to the sparse worldwide pathology literature on this entity. The older of the two decedents had multiple comorbidities and died of DAD, which is an expected pathologic finding in fatal viral infection. The other decedent had progressive myotonic muscular dystrophy and died of acute bacterial bronchopneumonia likely caused by aspiration. Therefore, this patient likely died with COVID-19, not from COVID-19. These cases illustrate the challenges that pathologists and the medical community at large will face in determining the cause of death in decedents who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Some findings will represent true virus-related pathology, while others will reflect superimposed processes or unrelated illnesses. Separating bona fide virus-related pathology from potential confounders and red herrings in these complex scenarios will benefit from the experience and expertise of forensic pathologists and pulmonary pathologists.",

First, autopsies allow study of multiple organs and procurement of adequate tissue for diagnosis and research. Second, because they allow adequate sampling of affected tissues, they minimize the chances of missing an accurate diagnosis due to sampling error. There is an emerging conversation around myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients, and many in the medical community are wondering whether tissue examination will reveal evidence of myocarditis in these patients. With the caveat that ours is a very limited sample based only on two fatal cases, we have not observed evidence of myocarditis in these decedents. We have also not observed evidence of potentially reversible pathologic findings in the lungs, such as mucus plugs, tissue eosinophilia, or organizing pneumonia.",

We are fortunate to have capabilities to perform full body postmortem radiography prior to autopsy and perform the autopsies in a safe facility with appropriate PPE. However, we recognize that most hospital autopsy suites and medical examiner facilities are not equipped to handle a highly infectious disease. As we are continuing to receive unattended decedents with a history of suspected COVID-19, we are trying to increase the efficiency of our work flow and decrease the risk of exposure by utilizing the Toshiba computed tomography scanner more frequently and often using core needle biopsy tools to retrieve lung specimens, rather than opening the body. We will be collecting and analyzing COVID-19 information to help understand trends, triage decedents appropriately, and give families an accurate and specific cause of death. We are collecting specimens for potential further research, including the development of specific stains for diagnosis, analysis of the cellular characteristics of the virally infected tissue, and the profiles of the immune response to the viral infection, which may prove to be valuable.",

It is important to stress that ARDS develops only in a subset of severely ill patients with COVID-19. It is likely, therefore, that the tissue response is different in individuals with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms. Because we are in the midst of a pandemic, we are answering the call to action and reporting these findings to understand the pathology of COVID-19. We express our sincere gratitude to all the people who are working tirelessly during this crisis, and we hope that our description of the precautions taken during these autopsies will be helpful to others.",

An endotracheal tube is shown with its tip above the level of the clavicular heads in the cervical trachea (white arrow). There is marked gastric distension with air (asterisk).
