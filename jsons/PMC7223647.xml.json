They provide stabilization and facilitate transfer of infants from lower acuity hospitals to higher levels of care. In the United States there are gaps in availability between level III or higher obstetric care and neonatal care, as 18% of obstetric critical care units were found to have no Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) [2]. This environment is therefore conducive for postnatal transport of critically ill infants. Furthermore, the distribution of specialized care varies across the United States [3]. Retrospective studies have shown associations between duration of transport and increased neonatal mortality [4]. Provision of neonatal intensive care during transport of newborns from a community hospital to a tertiary center is an important determinant of patient outcomes [5].",

The most important variable is timing there is no way of knowing when a request for emergent transport will be received (e.g., day vs. night, weekday vs. weekend, holiday). Duration of transport varies based on traffic, weather, and interfacility distance. Many teams commented on how the clinical situation may change between the time a call comes in from a referral hospital and the time the transport team arrives at the referral hospital, making it difficult for a transport team to adequately prepare to manage certain patients. Transport teams reported working with a wide range of referral hospitals, from an emergency room at a community hospital up to a level III NICU. Accordingly, teams reported variation in the skill levels of staff at referral hospitals.",

Unpredictability poses several significant challenges to the transport team. Given that most transport teams relied on staff who were in house caring for other patients and/or staff coming in from home, these teams often reported delays in time of departure due to lack of sufficient personnel. Prior investigation has revealed that NICUs in the U.S. are already understaffed for RNs relative to national guidelines [15]. The majority of the teams we interviewed expressed concerns over both RN and RT staffing, a concern echoed by Kornelsen and colleagues (2018) who reported on high acuity rural transport [16]. Hospital-based staffing for transport teams is economical but takes personnel away from in house patient assignments, delays departure, and lacks flexibility. Our findings suggest dedicated transport services, including dedicated transport personnel, may improve expediency and efficiency. In Maryland, one hospital found that the formation of a dedicated NICU staff nurse position, where responsibilities were restricted to going on transports and attending deliveries requiring the NICU team, resulted in improved clinical outcomes and optimized the use of nursing full-time equivalents [17].",

Future research is needed to measure the fiscal impact of transport services, including mode of transport costs and emergency medical response services. Parts of Europe have developed centralized transfer services with mixed results. A study of Neonatal Emergency Transport Services operating in Liguria, Italy found that teams needed to carry out 200-350 transports per year in order to be financially viable and for staff to acquire and maintain the necessary skills [18]. In the U.S., Karlsen and colleagues (2011) found that 85% of the unit-based transport teams carried out less than 200 transports each year, whereas 73% of dedicated transport teams carried out more than 200 transports each year [8]. Our participating teams, most of which were unit-based, carried out a median annual transport volume of 57. More research is needed to calculate the cost of maintaining a dedicated team and the number of transports they need to perform to justify the cost. Several of the teams we interviewed said that the administration felt that neonatal transport was a \u201cmoney loser\u201d for the hospital, yet no metric exists to measure the revenue brought to the hospital by each patient who is transported.",

Positive outcomes were reported by teams that used a transfer center, and those that were part of a health care system where the transport team, neonatologist, and referral hospital all had access to real-time updates from the electronic medical record. Given that the cost for just the technical equipment at a transfer center is estimated to be about $89,000 [14], a free-standing transfer center shared by several hospitals or other units within a hospital could potentially be an economical solution. Similarly, tele-neonatology may facilitate collaboration between the receiving hospital, transport team, and referral hospital [19, 20]. It has been shown to improve the quality of care provided during high-risk newborn resuscitations and improve assessment of patient stability during transport management of simulated newborns [21\u201323].

Not all transport team members were present at our focus group discussions, meaning that certain perspectives may not have been captured in our analysis. It is also possible there have been changes in team composition or performance during the period when TRIPS scores were analyzed and the time when focus groups were convened. It was not within the scope of this study to link the perspectives of health care providers to clinical performance outcomes or other significant metrics like out-the-door time. We interviewed transport teams only in California and recognize that the operation of teams in other states in the U.S. and around the world may differ. More research is needed to validate perspectives and determine best practices for neonatal transport.",
