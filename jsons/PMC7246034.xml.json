Within the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there were approximately 1.1 million people aged \u2265 13 years living with HIV in 2015 [2]. Interestingly, most people with HIV are between the ages of 45\u201354, despite a much higher infection rate in younger individuals, indicating that people are surviving much longer with the disease [2]. In fact, since 2010, there has been a 34% decrease in AIDS-related deaths [3]. With fewer HIV positive (HIV+) patients succumbing to the progression of their disease, there is now a larger subset of these patients at risk for sustaining a traumatic injury. To optimize care for these patients, a keen understanding of the impact HIV has on outcomes in trauma is needed.",

Since publication of these studies, the life expectancy in HIV+ patients has improved dramatically with the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) such that the life expectancy gap relative to HIV negative (HIV\u2212) patients is now as low as 8 years [10\u201312]. In addition, many of the available studies either analyze a small population and/or are conducted at a single center [4\u20136, 9]. Therefore, we sought to provide a large contemporary descriptive analysis of clinical outcomes in HIV+ trauma patients. We hypothesized that a HIV+ trauma cohort would have increased mortality rates, infectious complications (i.e., pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis), and inflammatory complications [i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI)], compared to a propensity-matched HIV\u2212 group.",

The variables utilized in our model included age, injury severity score (ISS), mechanism of injury, systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission, and comorbidities such as history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), steroid use, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and disseminated cancer. Patients with similar propensity scores were matched to compare outcomes among patients with and without HIV. Only cases that were within 0.001 of the estimated logit were selected. This technique of defining the closeness of a matched case is termed caliper matching and is a validated method of emulating randomization in observational studies [14]. Once propensity scores were calculated for each case, one HIV+ and two HIV\u2212 matched trauma patients were included for further analysis. If a close match was not available for a HIV+ trauma patient, they were excluded from analysis.",

There were 10 patients that did not fit into our propensity-matched model and were thus excluded from analysis (Fig. 1). Compared to a matched cohort of HIV\u2212 patients, the HIV+ patients had no differences in demographics, injury patterns, or vital signs upon hospital arrival. This confirmed successful matching between the two groups. Hypertension was the most common comorbid condition in both groups, followed by COPD, and diabetes. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most common injury in both groups followed by injuries to the lower extremity (Table 1).",

However, these studies are relatively old with data ranging from 1989 to 2006, a time when treatment for HIV was not widely available. In fact, the CDC estimates only 28% of all HIV+ patients in the U.S. had achieved viral suppression by 2010 [17]. The only research addressing infectious complications in modern-day HIV+ trauma patients has been through relatively small single center or multi-center studies conducted outside of the U.S. Both, Martin et al., who evaluated adult HIV+ trauma patients in Rwanda, and McPherson et al., who evaluated adult HIV+ patients with penetrating abdominal trauma in South Africa, demonstrated no difference in infectious complications [4, 9]. Similarly, we did not find a difference in infectious complications when comparing U.S. HIV+ to HIV\u2212 trauma patients. This is likely reflective of the growing prevalence of cART and should thus be considered as physicians counsel patients and/or make decisions regarding management of HIV+ trauma patients.",

Here we reported a higher rate of ARDS and AKI in HIV+ trauma patients, a finding that supports the work by Stawicki et al. and Duane et al. [5, 6]. The mechanism for this might be related to the chronic inflammatory state that remains in HIV+ patients despite adequate viral suppression from cART [18]. As a known inducer of systemic inflammation [19], traumatic injury in HIV+ patients may serve to further augment the inflammatory state already present. This can amplify the activity of neutrophils known to be a component of the chronic inflammatory state observed in HIV [20]. Neutrophil activation is known to be key in the pathogenesis of ARDS [21] so additional neutrophil involvement may make HIV+ trauma patients susceptible for the development of ARDS. This augmented inflammatory state may also amplify pre-existing renal tissue injury and contribute to the development of AKI. However, the mechanism for higher rates of AKI is likely multifactorial since AKI in HIV+ patients has typically been shown to have two or more contributing etiological factors such as infection, drug nephrotoxicity, and/or decreased renal perfusion [22]. The nephrotoxic effects of antiretroviral agents such as atazanavir, lopinavir, indinavir, and tenofovir are well documented [23\u201325] and may occur insidiously [26]. It is possible that traumatic injury in HIV+ patients led to decreased renal perfusion from hypovolemia, exacerbating pre-existing renal injury and increasing the likelihood for AKI. More research is needed to evaluate the pathophysiology behind the increased rates of ARDS and AKI among HIV+ trauma patients. Clinicians should be aware of this finding to attempt to mitigate this through vigilant monitoring and/or targeted interventions.",

The estimated prevalence of HIV in the US population in 2015 was 0.3%, which is much higher than the observed prevalence in this study. This could indicate a significant population of missed HIV+ patients in the cohort. Another limitation is in how HIV positivity was determined. To be considered HIV+ for this study, an ICD-9 diagnosis code for HIV must have been present. However, HIV is not a mandated comorbid condition. Therefore, it is possible HIV+ patients went unaccounted for, potentially further explaining the much lower prevalence of HIV in our study relative to the United States general population. Additionally, the TQIP database does not provide information on a patient\u2019s CD4 count, viral load, or treatment, which creates a non-homogenous population of HIV+ patients. Furthermore, we do not have any information regarding baseline renal function or prior history of infectious complications in our patient population, which may be serving as potential confounders. An additional important point to consider is the finding of no statistically significant difference in mortality rate between the two study groups despite the rate being nearly double in the HIV+ group. This may represent a type II error and should be investigated further with a larger multicenter study. Finally, as a retrospective study, our findings cannot be interpreted as causation. Our findings can only serve as markers of a correlation that merits future exploration.",
