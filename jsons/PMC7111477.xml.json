            "text": "Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa hemorrhagic fever, and it is responsible for 100,000 to 300,000 human infections and around 5000 deaths in West Africa per year (Houlihan and Behrens, 2017). Indeed, the 2019 outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria remains ongoing, and has already resulted in 472 confirmed cases with a case fatality rate of 23.3% as of March 2019 (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, 2019). Currently there are no FDA-approved LASV-specific antivirals or vaccines. Ribavirin is commonly used for Lassa fever in the early course of illness, but it is not suggested for post-exposure prophylaxis (Houlihan and Behrens, 2017). In pre-clinical studies, treatment with 300 mg/kg/day favipiravir (T-705), an RNA polymerase inhibitor, resulted in 100% survival in mice (Oestereich et al., 2016) and guinea pig (Safronetz et al., 2015) infected with LASV. Moreover, when used synergistically with ribavirin, favipiravir significantly improved disease outcome in LASV-infected mice (Carrillo-Bustamante et al., 2017). Human monoclonal antibodies that target LASV glycoproteins also represent a possible future treatment strategy for Lassa fever (Warner et al., 2018).",

LASV entry is mediated solely by the GPC, which is first synthesized as a single polypeptide and then cleaved by signal peptidase and subtilisin/hexin-isoenzyme-1/site-1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) into three segments: the stable signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding subunit GP1, and the membrane fusion subunit GP2 (Bederka et al., 2014). The SSP, GP1, and GP2 are noncovalently bound to each other and together form trimers that are packed onto the virion surface (Bederka et al., 2014). The SSP consists of 58 amino acids with two transmembrane domains and one ectodomain (Bederka et al., 2014). The GP1 subunit is associated with receptor recognition, and it interacts with cellular receptors alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) (Acciani et al., 2017) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (Jae et al., 2014). The GP2 subunit is a class I viral fusion protein and upon exposure to acidic environment undergoes a conformational change that triggers membrane fusion (Igonet et al., 2011). SSP is essential in GPC maturation (Burri et al., 2013) and promotes GPC-mediated pH-dependent membrane fusion by interacting with the GP2 subunit (Messina et al., 2012).",

The conformational change leads to the exposure of the hydrophobic fusion peptide, resulting in fusion between the viral and endo-lysosomal membranes (White and Whittaker, 2016). To examine whether losmapimod could directly inhibit LASV-GP mediated fusion, a cell-cell fusion assay was performed. HEK293T cells expressing LASV-GP or LCMV-GP and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were subjected to a low-pH treatment and syncytium formation was observed by fluorescence microscopy. ST-193 is known as a viral fusion inhibitor that targets LASV-GP2 (Larson et al., 2008), while F3406-2010 is a LCMV-specific fusion inhibitor (Ngo et al., 2015), and these two compounds were used as controls for the fusion assays. As mentioned before, the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 was able to block LASV entry by preventing acidification of the endo-lysosome pathway (Fig. 3), but was unable to block cell-to-cell membrane fusion triggered directly by a high extracellular proton concentration, and thus was used as a negative control in the fusion assays (Fig. 4\n). As shown in Fig. 4A, losmapimod inhibited fusion that was mediated by LASV-GP but not LCMV-GP, which is consistent with the compound specificity displayed in Table 1. The same result was observed on a T7 RNA polymerase-based luciferase reporter cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 4B). In this assay, losmapimod dose-dependently inhibited the reporter gene expression driven by T7 polymerase, which functioned in syncytium formed by LASV-GP mediated cell-cell fusion.",

As shown in Fig. 5\nA, the LASV-GP-FP mutant was constructed by replacing the LASV-GP fusion peptide (E270 to E287, LASV-GP numbering) with the LCMV fusion peptide (S276 to A293, LCMV-GP numbering); the LASV-GP-SSP-TM mutant was constructed by a replacement of both LASV-GP-SSP (F7 to T58, LASV-GP numbering) and LASV-GP-TM (Q416 to I443, LASV-GP numbering) with LCMV-GP-SSP (M7 to G58, LCMV-GP numbering) and LCMV-GP-TM (R422 to V449, LCMV-GP numbering). The LASV/LCMV-GP mutant constructs were then used to produce HIV-based pseudotyped viruses, which were used to test losmapimod activity.

Conversely, the LCMV specific inhibitor F3406-2010 was ineffective at inhibiting LASV-GPwt/HIV-luc and LASV-GP-FPmut/HIV-luc, although it remained active against LCMV-GPwt/HIV-luc and LASV-GP-SSP-TMmut/HIV-luc. As shown in Fig. 5B, similar to ST-193, the activity of losmapimod against LASV-GP-FPmut/HIV-luc was comparable to that of LASV-GPwt/HIV-luc, indicating that the fusion peptide of LASV-GP2 is not the region targeted by losmapimod.

Drug repurposing has become an attractive approach in antiviral discovery and development in recent years (Ashburn and Thor, 2004). Losmapimod was developed as an oral p38 MAPK inhibitor for the treatment of COPD or cardiovascular diseases under phase II/III clinical investigations. Our p38 knock-down assay showed that the inhibitory effect of losmapimod against LASV entry is not dependent upon the down regulation of its original therapeutic target, p38 MAPK. We then considered whether losmapimod inhibited LASV entry by interacting with cellular receptors. Arenaviruses employ different cellular receptors for entry. The New World arenaviruses use human transferrin receptor (hTfR1) (Sarute and Ross, 2017), while Lujo virus, an Old World arenavirus, uses NRP2 and CD63 for entry (Raaben et al., 2017). Conversely, LCMV, which is a prototype arenavirus belonging to the Old World serotype, uses \u03b1-DG as the receptor for entry, the same as LASV (Cao et al., 1998). Among the nine arenaviruses tested in our study, losmapimod only displayed activity against LASV. Since losmapimod inhibited the entry of LASV but not LCMV, despite the fact that the two viruses share the same cellular receptor, we postulate that losmapimod is not targeting the cell surface receptor \u03b1-DG but rather LASV GPC itself.",

            "text": "The fact that losmapimod could directly inhibit LASV-GP mediated fusion in an artificial extracellular low pH condition suggests that the inhibitory effect of losmapimod on LASV fusion is not achieved by affecting the proton influx. Instead, these data imply a direct interaction with the LASV glycoprotein. The unique SSP-GP2 interface of the arenavirus glycoprotein is crucial for viral fusion and is therefore an attractive target for antivirals, as many previously discovered arenavirus entry inhibitors, such as ST-193, F3406-2010, lassamycin-1 and lacidipine, all target this sensitive domain (Shankar et al., 2016; Thomas et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2018; York et al., 2008). Our fragment replacing mutational study of LASV-GP and LCMV-GP demonstrated that losmapimod also targets the LASV-SSP-GP2 interface. Interestingly, losmapimod showed relatively similar inhibitory activity among four strains of LASV, while ST-193 was less efficacious against LASV strain LP (Table 1 and Fig. S3A). Sequence analyses revealed that GP from LASV strain LP possessed an isoleucine at position 435 (within the TM region), whereas the GPs from the three other LASV strains possessed a valine at this position (Fig. S6). Not only does this suggest that the amino acid at position 435 plays a critical role in resistance to ST-193, which is consistent with a previous report (Larson et al., 2008), but it also implies that the mode of function of losmapimod is different from that of ST-193 and that the sequence variation within the SSP region does not affect losmapimod activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations within the SSP or TM regions confer resistance to drugs such as lacidipine (Wang et al., 2018) and ST-193 (Larson et al., 2008), and it will be interesting to determine whether similar mutations arise in response to treatment with losmapimod.",

            "text": "A major benefit of drug repurposing, compared with the traditional de novo discovery process, is the high success rate due to available safety data from clinical studies (Ashburn and Thor, 2004). As a repurposed drug, the dose regimens for new applications are often required to be comparable or lower than the original therapeutic dose. In this study, the efficacy of losmapimod against LASV in vitro (EC50: 0.71\u20133.68 \u03bcM, Fig. 1, Fig. 2) was not as potent as that against its original target p38 MAPK (EC50: 25 nM, Table S2), making it difficult to repurpose losmapimod as a treatment of Lassa hemorrhagic fever. However, as an aryl heteroaryl bis-carboxyamide derivative, a structurally distinctive LASV fusion inhibitor, losmapimod is also a cation amphiphilic drug (CAD) with a logP of 4.012 (Funk and Krise, 2012), which potentially enables it to accumulate in the endo-lysosomal compartments, where it displays its anti-LASV fusion effect. Indeed, these unique structural characteristics make losmapimod a valuable lead for the future development of anti-LASV agents.",
