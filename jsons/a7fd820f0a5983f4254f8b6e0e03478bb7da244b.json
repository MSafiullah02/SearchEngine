Although disease etiology remains unknown, coronaviruses are suspected to be involved in MS pathology. Molecular mimicry, the recognition of two antigens by a single immune cell, could be the mechanism explaining the link between a viral infection and MS through activation of myelin-reactive T cells by a virus infection in a genetically predisposed individual. Evidence supporting this hypothesis in humans has been accumulated in our laboratory. Human coronavirus (HCoV) -myelin cross-reactive T-cell lines (TCL) were predominantly found in MS patients compared to patients with other neurological or inflammatory diseases, or healthy controls. Moreover, virusmyelin T cell cross-reactivity was confirmed at the clonal level. Molecular mimicry between infectious pathogens such as the ubiquitous human respiratory coronaviruses could, in genetically susceptible individuals, play a role leading to the development of MS. Together with other possible mechanisms such as bystander effects, epitope spreading or even superantigenic activities, this pathogen-associated immune induction could play a role in maintaining and broadening the autoimmune response associated with MS pathology. autoimmunity, T cells, central nervous system, virus, molecular mimicry 1.",

Moreover, determinant (epitope) spreading would broaden the immune response towards the recognition of new autoantigens.

According to this model, a non-self agent first activates an immune cell. Then, the cell recognizes a self-element that shares antigenic conformation with the pathogen and directs a response towards it. Individuals who are genetically predisposed to respond to this antigenic determinant of a pathogen having a similar conformation to a determinant on a self-antigen could develop an autoimmune response following infection. Shared sequences or similar determinant conformations between coronavirus and myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) have been identified (33) (34) (35) . Molecular mimicry provides a unifying mechanism that could explain both the genetic and environmental aspects in the triggering of MS.",

In this study, peripheral blood lymphocytes from MS patients and healthy controls were used to select long-term MBP-and HCoV-reactive T cell lines. A summary of these results is shown in Table 1 . MBP T-cell lines were found as frequently in MS patients than in healthy controls. All the participants tested seropositive for coronavirus, as expected (22) . Interestingly, TCL from ten of sixteen MS patients and two of fourteen control subjects showed cross-reactivity between myelin and viral antigens, for a proportion of such lines of 29% in MS patients and only 1.3% in healthy donors. Such crossreactivity is thus highly significantly observed in MS patients. Therefore, in genetically predisposed individuals, T cells could be primed and activated following a systemic infection; the activated lymphocyte would enter the CNS and could establish a response towards myelin antigens. Myelinreactive T lymphocytes could also have a role in broadening the immune response and increasing tissue damage. Coronavirus-myelin cross-reactive lymphocytes could thus initiate, maintain and/or amplify autoimmunity. Table I .

Molecular mimicry, the recognition of two antigens by one single immune cell, could be the mechanism explaining the link between a viral infection and MS. Evidence of molecular mimicry between coronavirus and myelin antigens have been described in humans by our laboratory. Cross-reactive TCL were found predominantly in MS patients compared to patients with other neurological or inflammatory diseases, or healthy controls. Moreover, the T cell cross-reactivity was confirmed at the clonal level. However, it is important to keep in mind that the role of molecular mimicry does not exclude the participation of other immune mechanisms such as bystander effects, determinant spreading or even superantigens in the triggering or development of this autoimmune disease. All those mechanisms could play a role in maintaining or broadening the autoimmune response. The association of infection by a ubiquitous virus such as the human coronavirus with the development of multiple sclerosis in genetically susceptible individuals most likely represents the result of an aberrant induction of immune responses towards myelin proteins, possibly coupled to a persistent virus infection of the central nervous system that may activate glial cells (39) , induce neuronal loss (40) and be associated with local immunopathology (41) . Table 4 . To assess whether coronavirus-myelin cross-reactive TCL were only found in MS or could also be detected in other diseases, 13 MS patients, 10 patients suffering either of a neurological or an inflammatory disease, as well as 12 healthy controls were studied in comparison. For each group, TCL were produced and selected with MBP, HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43, then were tested with a proliferation assay against both CNS proteins and both human coronavirus serotypes. The coronavirus-myelin cross-reactive TCL are shown in bold; those are also compared to the overall monospecific TCL number produced during the experiment to determine the percentage of cross-reactive TCL generated per studied group of donors.
