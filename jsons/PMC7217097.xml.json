There is a mounting evidence that severe COVID-19 is characterized by an imbalanced multi-system immune-inflammatory response to the pathogen by the host, and acknowledged risk factors for poorer outcome are older age and preexisting non-respiratory chronic pro-inflammatory conditions such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (1). Hypertransaminasemia, low platelet count and hypoalbuminemia have been associated with high mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, but whether preexisting chronic liver disease is an additional risk factor for a severe course is still matter of debate (2). Our preliminary experience suggested that patients with cirrhosis, liver transplantation, autoimmune liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, have a benign course during the pandemic (3, 4). Nonetheless there are no granular figures on patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD)(5).",

In this respect, hepatologists are discussing several aspects related to the care of patients with liver disease. The European Society for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) have recently published a joint position paper on these issues, and tried to answer important questions such as: 1) Does SARS-CoV-2 cause liver injury? 2) Are patients with chronic liver disease at increased risk of developing COVID-19? 3) Are liver patients under immunosuppression at increased risk of developing COVID-19? 4) Should the management of a liver patient with COVID-19 take into account the risks related to the underlying condition and to drug interactions? Previous studies found that patients with severe pneumonia were more likely to develop abnormal transaminases compared to milder cases. Nonetheless the increase of transaminases might represent the consequence of critical illness, rather than a contributory factor (8).",

Liver cells can be infected by this virus, since its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed on cholangiocytes (2). However, indirect signs of biliary injury have not been recorded in patients with severe COVID-19 (9). Nonetheless, since in general the comorbidities are risk factors for severe COVID-19, it is likely that cirrhotic patients in a labile compensation status are more vulnerable than the general population. For this reason, the EASL/ESCMID position paper suggests to adopt several protective measures in patients with any chronic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, listed for transplantation or who received a transplant recently (8).

There is growing evidence confirming this finding, including some reports suggesting that immunosuppression may even provide some protection from lung damage in patients with COVID-19. However different immunosuppressive drugs have a different effector pathway, therefore a generalization of this concept seems unwise. Immunosuppressive medications have effects on humoral immunity, cell-mediated immunity and neutrophil function, potentially increasing the risk of severe infections caused by many viral agents. Nonetheless, in previous Coronaviruses epidemics, IS have not been shown to favour a complicate course, and this study confirms it.",

However it should be reminded that patients with autoimmune disorders under chronic steroid treatment are at risk of developing adrenal crises under any physical stress, due to secondary adrenal insufficiency. Therefore AILD patients developing severe COVID-19 should be administered steroids for adrenal replacement.",
