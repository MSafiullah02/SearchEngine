According to the German enactment of animal welfare and farming of animals that is called \u201cTierschutz-Nutztierhaltungsverordnung\u201d (TierschNutztV, 2006) calves over 2 weeks of age have to be allowed ad libitum access to water. Prior to this age they must supply their daily need for fluid through the intake of milk or milk replacer (MR). Considering the feeding practice of calves there are differences in the water intake between ad libitum-fed and restrictively-fed calves. Calves fed MR ad libitum drank only 0.45 kg water per day until weaning at the age of 5 weeks (Richard et al., 1988). Whereas animals fed restrictive volumes of MR had a daily water intake of more than 1.0 kg within the first 3 weeks of life (Kertz et al., 1984).",

            "text": "Calf diarrhea especially occurs in the first weeks of life (Azizzadeh et al., 2012) and is associated with fecal losses of water and electrolytes that leads to an isotonic or hypotonic dehydration in diarrheic calves. Hyponatremia is the most common abnormality in blood chemistry in these calves (Dalton et al., 1965). The treatment of calf diarrhea is based on the administration of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) for diarrheic calves with a sufficient suckle reflex. In addition to ORS treatment, they should receive their milk meal which is necessary to maintain energy supply (Heath et al., 1989). Preparing ORS in milk or MR is an easy way for farmers to provide diarrheic calves with electrolytes without adverse effects (Bachmann et al., 2009, Goodell et al., 2012). Such milk\u2013ORS-mixtures are hypertonic, and administering them should cause thirst. Therefore, calves receiving milk\u2013ORS have to have ad libitum access to water to adjust their hydration status (Bachmann et al., 2012). In a previous study the daily water intake increased 25 to 50% when calves developed diarrhea (Jenny et al., 1978). A similar result was noted by Kertz et al. (1984). In this study calves with ad libitum access to water gained more body weight and ingested more calf starter. Currently no study exists which considers the influence of feeding hypertonic ORS on the water intake of diarrheic calves.",

Diarrhea occurred in 98 of these calves. Calves were removed from the study when diseases other than diarrhea occurred such as omphalitis, pneumonia and arthritis with disturbed general condition. This accounted for only 2 calves. The diarrheic period of each calf was determined by its fecal consistency whereas a soupy or watery fecal consistency was classified as having diarrhea. The period of diarrhea was finished when the feces had a pulpy or pasty consistency again. Within the period of diarrhea, data for ORS intake, weight gain and duration of diarrhea were gathered for 81 of the 98 diarrheic calves. These 81 datasets were used for the analysis of diarrheic calves during the period of diarrhea. The calves had ad libitum access to water and were provided with hay and concentrate feed.",

The animals were weighted and a fecal sample was collected and analyzed microscopically for Cryptosporidium oocysts according to Heine (1982). Additionally a quick test (Fassisi\u00aeBioDa, sandwich-immunoassay) was used to detect rota and corona virus, E. coli (K99) and Cryptosporidium parvum. In the case of diarrhea, the restrictively-fed calves were randomly assigned to one of the following oral rehydration treatments: one group received ORS (Lytafit\u00ae, Albrecht GmbH, Aulendorf, Germany) prepared in 2 L milk (milk\u2013ORS) 3 times a day (30 calves) and the other group got ORS prepared in 2 L water (water\u2013ORS) 2 h after feeding of the milk meal 3 times a day (26 calves). The ad libitum-fed calves received ORS prepared in 2 L water (milk a.l.+water\u2013ORS) 3 times a day in addition to ad libitum milk administration (25 calves) (\nTable 1). The daily intake of water, milk, ORS and general condition were recorded. When the feces had a consistency of 1 or 2 the calves were weighted again and the ORS-feeding was discontinued. During the study there was a high level of care by the examiner. When the calves had not ingested their milk meals they were encouraged to drink by leading them to the nipple. When diarrhea occurred the examiner accustomed the calves to the bucket containing water\u2013ORS. They had to learn that there was water\u2013ORS available.",

The period of diarrhea is an individual period of each calf from the beginning of diarrheic disease (the first diarrheic day) to the end. Diarrhea is associated with watery or soupy feces. ORS intake refers to the intake of the commercial product Lytafit\u00ae (Albrecht) that contained according to the manufacturer's data glucose, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, lactose, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and glycine. The application of Lytafit\u00ae (Albrecht) was in portions of 75 g dissolved in 2 L water or 2 L milk dependent on the feeding group. The total electrolyte intake was determined by the sum of sodium [Na+], potassium [K+] and chloride [Cl\u2212] ions contained in milk and ORS. The milk used was a mixture of raw milk from in-house cows considered to be in mid-lactation. Osmolality, [Na+], [K+], [Cl\u2212] and energy content were estimated or calculated according to the specifications of the manufacturer of the ORS, according to Gaucheron (2005) for milk electrolytes and to Kamphues et al.

In the present study restrictively-fed calves drank 1.1 L water per day within the first 3 weeks of life. We do not think that the water intake of young calves can be ignored, as even heavier ruminating adult goats have only a daily water intake of 2.4 L (B\u00f8e et al., 2011). In studies in which calves were fed acidified MR ad libitum they drank smaller amounts of water (0.4 kg/d) (Richard et al., 1988, Hepola et al., 2008). The ad libitum-fed calves in the present study had twice higher mean daily water intakes within the observation period. Restrictively-fed calves have to fulfill their fluid requirements that exceed the available daily amount of milk with an increased water intake. Furthermore, restrictively-fed animals maybe have higher water intakes due to hunger. The missing satiety of calves fed low volumes of milk was expressed in other trials by considerably more visits to the milk feeder without receiving milk compared to calves fed large volumes of milk (Borderas et al., 2009, de Passill\u00e9 et al., 2011). It was suggested 30 years ago that calves benefit from the provision of water early in life through improved performance (Thickett et al., 1981). However, ad libitum water access for young calves in Europe is often still not realized at dairy farms because legislation dictates ad libitum water access only for calves older than 2 weeks of life.",

Due to increased losses of fluid via feces the calves had a greater need of water to prevent dehydration. More than a threefold increase of the mean daily water intake (0.5 to 1.7 L/d) was recorded in the milk\u2013ORS calves during the period of diarrhea.

Similar results were ascertained before (Kertz et al., 1984, Borderas et al., 2009). In the study of Kertz et al. (1984) the water intake of calves in their first days of life is high relative to their concentrate intake due to the low concentrate intake of young calves. The results of the present trial confirm the data of Kertz et al. (1984). Therefore, water intake is not only induced by concentrate intake. That intake of concentrate follows water intake and not vice versa was also determined in recent studies (Richard et al., 1988). From day 11 to 21 of life low-fed calves daily consume 22 g concentrates versus 16 g/d of calves fed higher amounts of milk, an effect which was statistically not significant. Calves may try to compensate for the low energy sustenance through lower milk intake and higher concentrate intakes. However, this mechanism may not succeed in the first weeks of age because of incomplete rumen development (Borderas et al., 2009, de Passill\u00e9 et al., 2011). Concentrate intakes are reduced according to high milk intakes. Calves prefer milk to concentrates and, if possible, satisfy their energy requirement with milk intake (de Passill\u00e9 et al., 2011).",

(2001) ascertained that in calves fed higher amounts of milk the days with diarrhea were reduced and this might be caused due to higher resistance towards pathogens induced by better nutrition. The duration of diarrhea was not different between the feeding regimens in our trial. Despite the lowest ORS intake of 2.0 L/d, the milk a.l.+water\u2013ORS calves had daily total electrolyte intakes of 958 mmol and total fluid intakes of 8.8 L/d during the period of diarrhea that could compensate the fluid and electrolyte losses caused by diarrhea. The milk\u2013ORS group had the highest daily ORS intake (4.6 L). The calves of the milk\u2013ORS group were already used to drink the milk meal, while the other groups had to learn water\u2013ORS intake. Therefore, the calves fed milk\u2013ORS had the highest [Cl\u2212], [Na+] and total daily electrolyte intakes (1116 mmol). Diarrhea is distinguished by a decrease in extracellular fluid volume and a negative sodium and potassium balance (Dalton et al., 1965). Clinically diarrheic calves are often dehydrated due to the reduction of total body water (Thornton and English, 1978). Jones et al. (1984) determined a trend towards increasing plasma osmolality after the administration of a hyperosmotic ORS to diarrheic calves. This results in the stimulation of thirst, increased water intake and increased fluid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, followed by rehydration.",

            "text": "The daily weight gain during the period of diarrhea was not statistically different between feeding regimens although the milk a.l.+water\u2013ORS calves had significantly higher energy intake (19.5 MJ/d). Therefore, contrary to our expectations the milk a.l.+water\u2013ORS calves gained only 587 g/d. The water\u2013ORS group descriptively had the lowest daily milk, energy and total electrolyte intake. This resulted in mean daily weight gains of 474 g during the diarrheic period. Comparatively, the milk\u2013ORS group had a daily weight gain of 658 g with a daily energy intake of 15.5 MJ. The milk\u2013ORS calves ingested 15% of their energy via ORS intake. Compared to this, the milk a.l.+water\u2013ORS group received energy mainly by milk and only 5% came from ORS intake. The ORS contained glucose as a fast available energy source and amino acids that are directly absorbed from the small intestine, whereas milk contains lactose and proteins which have to be hydrolyzed before the adsorption by the enzyme lactase into glucose and galactose or by peptidases into tri- and di-peptides, respectively (Hartmann, 2002). An infection with Cryptosporidium species leads to villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia mainly in the jejunum and ileum (Heine et al., 1984). There are depressed levels of enzyme activities caused by mucosal damage that affect digestion and absorption (Tzipori et al., 1982). Diarrheic calves have a reduced activity of the leucyl aminopeptidases, an enzyme that splits the peptides of alimentary proteins in the intestinal lumen (Krautzig et al., 1986). Dargel and Hartmann (1984) determined that the activity of lactase in the small intestine in diarrheic calves is decreased by half compared to healthy contemporary calves. A reduced enzymatic activity resulted in a lower digestibility of milk ingredients and a greater fecal excretion of undigested nutrients. The milk\u2013ORS group had [Na+] intakes of 106 mmol/L that corresponds to the recommendation that an oral rehydration therapy solution should have [Na+] of 90\u2013130 mmol/L (Constable et al., 2009). High [Na+] contents are necessary to reduce the negative sodium balance in the diarrheic calves. The used ORS contains higher amounts of [Na+] than milk (Table 2). Additionally the transport of glucose and amino acids from the gut lumen into the enterocytes of the small intestine is mainly mediated via a Na+-dependent co-transport system (Souba and Pacitti, 1992, Hartmann, 2002). The intake of electrolytes and organic solutes into enterocytes increases the osmotic pressure. Consecutively water follows and may lead to a higher body weight (Krautzig et al., 1986). Probably the water\u2013ORS group had a worse absorption of nutrients due to low ORS intakes and the time lag between the milk and ORS feeding that results in high [Na+] availability when nutrients are low and vice versa. The force for the absorption of [Na+] is driven by a concentration gradient between extra- and intracellular space. This gradient is sustained by the Na+-/K+-ATPase that is not impaired in young diarrheic animals (Krautzig et al., 1986). The ingredients of ORS may be absorbed to a higher extent compared to milk because they do not have to be hydrolyzed and provide high amounts of Na+ available for the absorption via Na+-dependent co-transport systems.",
