            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that infects the liver as primary target. Currently, a high affinity receptor for HBV is still unknown. The dendritic cell specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN is involved in pathogen recognition through mannose and fucose containing carbohydrates leading to the induction of an anti-viral immune response. Many glycosylated viruses subvert this immune surveillance function and exploit DC-SIGN as a port of entry and for trans-infection of target cells. The glycosylation pattern on HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) together with the tissue distribution of HBV would allow interaction between HBV and DC-SIGN and its liver-expressed homologue L-SIGN. Therefore, a detailed study to investigate the binding of HBV to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was performed. For HCV, both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are known to bind envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Soluble DC-SIGN and L-SIGN specifically bound HCV virus-like particles, but no interaction with either HBsAg or HepG2.2.15-derived HBV was detected. Also, neither DC-SIGN nor L-SIGN transfected Raji cells bound HBsAg. In contrast, highly mannosylated HBV, obtained by treating HBV producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the a-mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine, is recognized by DC-SIGN. The a-mannosidase I trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide structures thus prevents recognition by DC-SIGN. On the basis of these findings, it is tempting to speculate that HBV exploits mannose trimming as a way to escape recognition by DC-SIGN and thereby subvert a possible immune activation response.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, consisting of a core particle enveloped by small (S), middle (M) and large (L) surface antigens, generally referred to as HBsAg. All three surface antigens contain a common S domain, both M and L proteins contain a preS2 domain and L exclusively contains a preS1 domain [7] . The liver and peripheral blood of HBV infected individuals can reach levels of 10 9 -10 10 infectious particles per mL. In addition, HBsAg is secreted from infected hepatocytes as spherical subviral particles and filaments, which can accumulate up to 100 lg \u2044 mL in peripheral blood [7, 8] . S is the main component of both HBV virions and HBsAg subviral particles, while M and L are highly enriched on HBV virions. Post-translational modifications of the surface antigens are crucial for HBV life cycle; myristoylation of the preS1 domain is essential for infectivity [6, 9] , while inhibition of N-glycosylation of the preS2 domain prevents secretion of viral particles [10, 11] . Recently, post-translational N-glycosylation of the preS1 domain has been reported as well and although it seems dispensable for HBV morphogenesis it might be involved in viral attachment [12] .",

C-type lectins recognize highly conserved pathogen-derived carbohydrate structures, leading to internalization, antigen processing and presentation to T cells [14] . A prototypical member of the C-type lectin family is the dendritic cell-specific lectin DC-SIGN [15] , which recognizes a broad range of glycosylated pathogens through mannose or fucose containing carbohydrates, including HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, Dengue virus, measles virus, human herpesvirus 8, SARS coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tubercolosis, Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus pneumonia and Neisseria meningitidis [16] [17] [18] . The outcome of this interaction is pathogen-dependent. Many of these DC-SIGN-binding pathogens have evolved to subvert the immune surveillance function of DC-SIGN for their own benefit and re-direct the internalization route to nonlysosomal compartments for protection and transmission to target cells [16] . Some pathogens can also modulate adaptive immune responses through interaction with DC-SIGN; e.g. M. tuberculosis exploits DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance by inhibition of the immunostimulatory function of dendritic cells [16, 19] .",

For HCV virus-like particles, DC-SIGN interaction leads to efficient capture, internalization and transport to nonlysosomal compartments within immature dendritic cells, thereby protecting the virus from degradation [21, 22] . Similarly, HCV viruslike particles interact with L-SIGN expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in situ, and are targeted to nonlysosomal early endosomes in L-SIGN transfected Raji cells [22] . DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are also thought to play an important role in HCV viral dissemination by transferring HCV from the circulation to hepatocytes, the main HCV target cells [23] .",

            "text": "Thus, neither HBsAg nor HBV interacts with DC-SIGN or L-SIGN, whereas both C-type lectins interact with HCV and other viruses such as HIV-1. These data suggest that the N-linked glycosylation of HBV is distinct from that of other viruses. To evaluate whether indeed native HBV glycosylation does not meet the requirements for DC-SIGN interaction, glycan modified HBV was generated by treating HBV-producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the a-mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine. Kifunensine causes the accumulation of Man 7-9 GlcNAc 2 oligosaccharides on glycoproteins by inhibiting mannose trimming in the endoplasmic reticulum [36] . Carbohydrate analysis of glycan modified HBV indeed demonstrated an increased amount of mannose structures compared to native HBV, shown by a two-fold increase in binding to the mannose-specific plant lectins Con A and GNA while binding to the N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectin WGA was unchanged (Fig. 5b) . Control incubations with an anti-HBsAg specific antibody showed that similar amounts of native and highly glycosylated HBV were coated (Fig. 5a) . The interaction between highly mannosylated HBV and DC-SIGN was studied by DC-SIGN-Fc-based ELISA (Fig. 5c) . Strikingly, HBV binding to DC-SIGN was observed after kifunensine treatment of the virus producing cells, and the binding could be inhibited by both mannan and EGTA. The protein structure of HBV is therefore compatible with DC-SIGN binding, but the native glycosylation, that exclusively determines DC-SIGN interaction, is not. This observation also excludes the possibility that lack of DC-SIGN-HBV interaction is observed due to too low sensitivity of the DC-SIGN assays used in this study. Supernatant of untreated HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cells showed no binding to DC-SIGN. Minor background binding was observed with supernatant of kifunensine-treated HepG2 cells, due to the accumulation of large amounts of highly mannosylated proteins in the medium during treatment. These data indicate that mannose trimming of the oligosaccharide structures present on HBV prevents interaction with DC-SIGN.",

Several putative binding receptors are proposed, but none of them are confirmed as high affinity receptors for HBV. Related to the issue of HBV entry is the way HBV reaches the hepatocyte: Is there direct contact between HBV in the circulation and hepatocytes, possibly through fenestrations in the LSEC [37] ? Or are other cell types involved in HBV dissemination, similar to HIV transport by dendritic cells for trans-infection of T cells [31] and HCV capture by LSEC promoting infection of hepatocytes [38] ? Since HBsAg are glycoproteins, the involvement of a C-type lectin receptor in viral recognition seems plausible. The best-characterised C-type lectins are the dendritic cellexpressed DC-SIGN and its LSEC-expressed homologue L-SIGN, both capable of recognizing a broad range of glycosylated pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa [16] .

In the coating control, the captured amount of untreated and mannosylated HBV is detected with an anti-HBS specific antibody. (c) The interaction of highly mannosylated HBV with DC-SIGN was studied by DC-SIGN-Fc ELISA, as described in Fig. 2 . Specificity of binding was determined in the presence of mannan or EGTA.

Notably, while mannose and N-acetylglucosamine seem to be present in similar amounts on both HBV and HBsAg, glycan structures on virions are enriched for galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose.

Even though data demonstrate that these viruses can exploit DC-SIGN for their own benefit, the majority of the captured virus is degraded and routed into the antigen presentation pathway [40] [41] [42] , thereby allowing the induction of an anti-viral immune response. Although HBV glycoproteins are involved in viral recognition, as they are known to bind mannose binding lectin and the asialoglycoprotein receptor, here it is shown that a-mannosidase I trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide structures prevents recognition by DC-SIGN. HBV is thus recognized by DC-SIGN as soon as one of the enzymes in the formation of complex glycans, a-mannosidase I, is inhibited and highly mannosylated virions are generated. Previous reports have shown the importance of HBV glycosylation for viral secretion [11, 43] and indeed we observe a decrease in secretion of highly mannosylated vs native HBV, under similar culture conditions.",

            "text": "We cannot rule out that patient sera contain a subpopulation of these highly glycosylated viremia that would allow interaction with DC-SIGN. Preliminary data on HBV derived from several patient sera with a high viral load did not show binding to DC-SIGN-Fc (data not shown), thereby indicating that DC-SIGN may not be involved in recognition of HBV in vivo either. On the basis of our findings, it is tempting to speculate that HBV exploits mannose trimming as a way to escape recognition by DC-SIGN and thereby subvert a possible immune activation response. Further studies are needed to address this issue.",
