            "text": "It has previously been shown that OxPL may act by binding to a GPCR. Parhami et al12 demonstrated that the treatment of aortic ECs with MM-LDL resulted in a saturable dose-dependent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The cAMP increase in response to MM-LDL treatment was caused by the stimulation of Gs complexes and inhibition of Gi complexes. Subsequent studies revealed involvement of different GPCR in the OxPL-mediated signaling pathway. During nonenzymatic deacylation and enzymatic hydrolysis, oxidized fatty acyl chains can be released from the sn-2 position of OxPL. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, which is also known as platelet-activation factor (PAF)-acetylhydrolase, catalyzes the conversion of OxPL into lysophospholipids, which can bind and activate various GPCRs. For example, lysophosphatidylcholine activates GPR4 and G2A receptors,13, 14, 15 whereas lysophosphatidic acid stimulates LPA1\u2013LPA4 receptors.16, 17 Furthermore, some OxPLs have a similar structure to PAF and are considered as potential PAF receptor agonists. The major PAF-like lipid in oxidated LDL (OxLDL) is 1-O-hexadecyl-2-(butanoyl or butenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.18 The activation of the PAF receptor by the OxPL resulted in IL-8 expression and monocyte binding to ECs.19, 20 However, some OxPL effects cannot be reproduced by the activation of the PAF receptor. As a well-recognized edemagenic agent, PAF does not mimic the barrier-protective effects of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC)21 as well as induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by OxPAPC,22 which suggests the involvement of receptor mechanisms rather than the PAF receptor. More recently, a Gs-coupled GPCR, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been implicated in the activation of beta-1 integrin and the stimulation of monocyte binding to ECs induced by OxPAPC and PEIPC.23 Butaprost, which is the specific agonist of PGE2, mimicked the effect of OxPAPC on the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- \u03b1) and IL-10 in monocyte-derived cells.23 Furthermore, EP2 antagonist AH6809 blocked the activation of EP2 by OxPAPC in HEK293 cells and blocked the IL-10 response to PEIPC in monocytic THP-1 cells.23\n",

Two conserved, positively charged amino acids in CD36 (lysines at positions of 164 and 166) are critical for OxPL and OxLDL binding to CD36.29 In contrast to the implication of CD36 in OxLDL recognition by macrophage, work by Walton et al30 demonstrated that IL-8 induction by OxPAPC is independent of CD36 and mediated by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and a 37-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein.",

            "text": "In addition to receptor-mediated mechanisms, some effects of OxPL are probably not mediated by cell membrane receptors. For example, the sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) seems to be activated as a consequence of cholesterol depletion by OxPAPC in ECs through a nonreceptor mechanism.31 During oxidation, esterified fatty acids in phospholipids are converted into a series of highly electrophilic ketoaldehyde isomers, which are ready to adduct to proteins by direct chemical modification. A study by Brame et al32 provides a new insight into the mechanism by which OxPL influences the function of cardiac K+ channel, and it suggests a generalized cellular mechanism for the alteration of the membrane function as a consequence of oxidative stress induced by OxPL. By using N-biotin labeled OxPAPC, Gugiu et al33 demonstrated the binding of OxPAPC to cytoskeleton-associated protein 4. This type II reversibly palmitoylated transmembrane protein regulates the tissue plasminogen activator on the surface of smooth muscle cells.",

            "text": "A characteristic feature of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of lipids in the lesion area. Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated that OxPL activates monocyte binding to the vascular EC; the initial event triggers vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis plaque formation and induces synthesis of monocyte-specific chemoattractants such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) and monocyte/EC adhesion proteins.8 Connecting segment 1 (CS1) fibronectin is an endothelial membrane protein that binds monocyte integrin \u03b14\u03b21, which causes the firm adhesion of monocyte with ECs.11 OxPAPC promotes the surface deposition of the CS-1 fibronectin, which is mediated by increased R-Ras activity and decreased H-Ras activity. In this model, OxPAPC increased cAMP levels, which are responsible for R-Ras activation. In turn, R-Ras activated PI3 K, which results in the activation of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin on the apical surface.36 A candidate receptor that mediates this pathway is prostaglandin receptor EP2,23 which belongs to the GPCR family. EP2 agonists increased the activation of beta 1 integrin. A line of evidence suggests lipoxygenase pathway as an alternative mechanism that regulates OxPL-induced monocyte adhesion. The treatment of ECs with a lipoxygenase inhibitor, but not cyclooxygenase, decreased MM-LDL and POVPC-induced monocyte binding to ECs.37 Furthermore, the addition of 12(S)- hydroperoxy tetraenoic eicosatetraenoic acid reversed the inhibitory effects of a lipoxygenase inhibitor on monocyte binding. Importantly, the mechanism of OxPL-induced monocyte binding to ECs is different from that induced by other inflammatory factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF\u03b1, or IL-1. OxPL does not upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression, but it upregulates MCP1, CS1, and P-selectin, which leads to selective monocyte, but not neutrophil, adhesion to the vascular endothelium.",

            "text": "Evidence indicates that OxPL increases the expression of several chemokines, including MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 \u03b1), MIP-1 \u03b2, and growth-related protein \u03b1, which are described well in previous reviews.38, 39, 40 These cytokines play important roles in the initiation and development of chronic inflammation. IL-8 transcription induced by OxPAPC lasts at least 18 h, with the peak of mRNA expression at approximately 6 h following OxPAPC treatment. In contrast, TNF\u03b1-induced IL-8 transcription reaches its peak at 1 h and remains increased during 4 h following treatment.41 Unlike classic inflammatory mediators such as LPS and TNF\u03b1, the induction of these inflammatory mediator genes by OxPL is achieved through different transcription mechanisms. IL-8 transcription is induced by TNF\u03b1 mainly through the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) pathway. The activation of IL-8 transcription by OxPL, however, is independent of the NF\u03baB pathway and may be mediated by various pathways that include the c-Src/JAK2/STAT3 pathway,41 PPAR\u03b3 pathway,8 eNOS/SREBP,42 and UPR.22, 34 Src kinases participate in growth factor/cytokine signal transduction pathways that mediate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. OxPAPC activates Src kinase and its downstream effector STAT3, which regulates IL-8 transcription through the binding to a gamma-interferon activation sequence element in the IL-8 promoter.43 Moreover, the activation of Src kinase by OxPAPC is independent of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway used by OxPAPC in activating \u03b21 integrin for monocyte binding mentioned above. Evidence indicates that OxPAPC activates SREBP in human artificial episomal chromosome after 1 h treatment, and the activation persisted for 8 h.31 More investigation provided evidence for the role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the activation of SREBP by OxPAPC. OxPAPC treatment of ECs induced a dose- and time-dependent activation of eNOS, and the NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester significantly inhibited SREBP activation and IL-8 synthesis by OxPAPC.42 Recent findings have shown a role for a UPR signaling cascade in OxPAPC-induced induction inflammatory cytokines. An immunohistochemical analysis of human atherosclerotic lesions indicated the activation of UPR in the areas that contain OxPL.34 The small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of ATF4 and XBP1, which are the 2 branches of UPR, downregulated both the basal and the OxPAPC-stimulated expression of IL-8, IL-6, MCP-1, and CXC motif ligand 3 in the human artery ECs.34 Inhibition of UPR by pharmacologic inhibitors or knockdown of cochaperone HTJ-1 decreased VEGF mRNA induction by OxPL.22 The expression levels of VEGF in OxPL-treated cells strongly correlated with the induction of ATF4 target genes ATF3 and TRB3. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that OxPL stimulated the binding of ATF4 to a regulatory site in the VEGF gene.",

Both of these signals are required for enhanced TF expression. A study by Bochkov et al44 shows that OxPAPC induces the expression of TF by ECs. A methyl ethyl ketone-specific inhibitor PD98059 suppressed Erk1/2 activation as well as EGR-1 and TF increase, which indicates a protein kinase C (PKC)/Erk/EGR-1 pathway as 1 pathway that contributes to the TF induction by OxPAPC. In addition, OxPAPC-induced an increase of cytosolic Ca++ activates calcineurin, which led to the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of nuclear factor activated T cells. Thus, the thrombogenic switch induced by OxPAPC in endothelium promotes the general procoagulant state characteristics of atherosclerosis and inflammation.",

Rac and Cdc42 signaling promotes EC barrier-protective functions. OxPAPC-induced activation of Rac and Cdc42 in pulmonary ECs leads to the enhancement of peripheral actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microspike-like actin structures at the cell\u2013cell interface.10 The coexpression of constitutively active Rac and Cdc42 reproduced the unique actin rearrangement observed in the OxPAPC-stimulated EC monolayer.10 An analysis of upstream mechanisms showed the involvement of PKA, Src, and PKC activities in the OxPAPC-induced Rac/Cdc42 activities.21, 55 The molecular mechanisms of the barrier-protective effects of PKA may be caused by its ability to attenuate the endothelial myosin light chain (MLC) kinase activity that leads to a decreased basal level of MLC phosphorylation; PAK-mediated inhibition of Rho activity; and phosphorylation of the actin-binding proteins filamin, adductin, dematin, as well as the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). These proteins lead to the disappearance of stress fiber and F-actin in the membrane ruffles. Our studies also indicated that OxPAPC induced the phosphorylation of cofillin,55 which promotes peripheral actin polymerization. In addition, OxPAPC induced the phosphorylation and membrane translocation of focal adhesion protein paxillin and FAK. A recent study demonstrated a potential role of paxillin in the feedback mechanism of Rac regulation by focal adhesions in the OxPAPC-stimulated ECs.56 The expression of paxillin with a mutated PAK1 attenuated OxPAPC-induced PAK1 activation and an EC barrier-protective response.56 The use of an siRNA approach provided evidence that the Rac/Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors Tiam1 and \u03b2PIX are involved in the OxPAPC-induced Rac activation and EC barrier protection in response to OxPAPC treatment.57\n",

Several studies have been performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism that underlies LPS-induced inflammation. LPS binds with the serum-binding protein called LPS binding protein and is delivered to the phosphatidylinositol glycan-linked cell surface protein CD14. The complex then interacts with TLR4 and its accessory protein MD2, and it recruits adaptor proteins MyD88 and Mal to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4.58, 59, 60, 61 The downstream signaling pathways of TLR4 include NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and Egr-1 transcription factors.62\n",

Thus, OxPL may represent a negative feedback mechanism that induces excessive inflammation. OxLDL and OxPL inhibit activation of NF-\u03baB induced by LPS and CpG DNA.49, 63 OxLDL inhibited LPS-induced IL-12 protein expression and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and activity in macrophages64 as well as an induction of E-selectin protein expression in ECs induced by LPS.65 Lysophosphatidylcholine inhibited the LPS induction of TF in monocytes.66 Bochkov et al65 revealed the mechanism of an OxPAPC inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inflammation using in vitro and in vivo models. The inhibitory effect of OxPAPC was specific for LPS but not for other inflammatory agonists such as IL-1 and TNF\u03b1; OxPAPC inhibited LPS signaling by blocking the binding of LPS to LBP and CD14. A later study by Walton et al67 proposed an alternative mechanism via an OxPAPC-induced disruption caveolae and inhibition of the assembly of the LPS signaling complex in ECs. In addition to blocking an inflammatory signaling cascade, our studies suggested that independent of the inhibitory mechanisms mentioned above, OxPAPC may also attenuate LPS-induced and VILI via the direct enhancement of vascular endothelial barrier function.50, 54\n",

COX2 is another enzyme that is involved in OxPL-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling and the resolution of inflammation. The expression of COX-2 is induced by OxPL in a cAMP-response-element-binding-protein-dependent and PPAR\u03b3-dependent manner.74 OxPL may also activate eNOS.42 Increased NO production has been associated with many anti-inflammatory activities including the downregulation of adhesion molecules, suppression of chemokine production, and inhibition of leukocyte extravasation. In summary, the above findings indicate that OxPL induces several anti-inflammatory signaling molecules and transcription factors and decreases the expression of inflammatory cytokines in pathologic conditions associated with acute injury or local inflammation.",

            "text": "The generation of OxPL is a general feature of lung injury and accompanying activation of ROS production induced by different pathogen infections. A study by Imai et al75 shows the accumulation of oxidized phosphorylcholine products in human and animal lungs infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, and anthrax, as well as in a mouse model of acid-induced lung injury. This study also suggests the involvement of OxPL in the development of ALI. OxPL increases in that study were monitored by tissue staining with a monoclonal EO6 antibody. The most potent antigens for this antibody are products of aldol condensation of fragmented products of PAPC oxidation, such as P(POVPC)VPC, diLysoPC-C9, and diOVPC, as well as Schiff bases that form covalent bonds between protein lysine residues and aldehyde groups of fragmented oxidized phospholipids such as POVPC-bovine serum albumin.76 As discussed above, fragmented PL oxidation products induce endothelial barrier disruption (see Table I\n77).10 Thus, EO6 antibodies do not discriminate between barrier-protective and barrier-disruptive OxPL. The generation of EO6-detectable OxPL in bronchioalveolar lavage and alveolar macrophages may represent the accumulation of fragmented PAPC oxidation products, aldol condensates, and Schiff bases rather than increased levels of PEIPC or PECPC. The OxPAPC doses used for intratracheal instillation (20 \u03bcg/g body weight) that affected lung elastance parameter were 5\u201310 times higher compared with the doses used in other studies that showed protective effects in the model of LPS-induced and CpG DNA-induced ALI.49 It also seems that in animal models of LPS-induced lung injury and VILI, as well as lung dysfunction associated with acute necrotizing pancreatitis, higher OxPAPC doses up to 40 mg/kg may be well tolerated if administered intravenously.49, 50, 51, 52 These doses promote vascular endothelial barrier function. In turn, the pathologic effects of high doses of intratracheal OxPAPC may be caused by the direct effects of OxPAPC on alveolar epithelial cells. Because the precise effects of OxPAPC on alveolar epithelial permeability and other physiologic responses have not been yet tested, it is possible that OxPAPC at reported doses may cause barrier-disruptive effects on epithelial cells. These possibilities need more testing.",

These important studies will improve the characterization of the composition of endogenous OxPL generated in the injured lung as well as the understanding of their role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Many published studies support the notion that cellular responses to OxPL are critically dependent on local OxPL concentrations.10 Thus, OxPL may play a dual role in the progression of ALI.

            "text": "OxPL generated in various pathologic conditions exhibits a broad range of biologic activities, including proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects as well as the regulation of lung permeability. Unlike classic inflammatory factors, OxPL triggers unique mechanisms that lead to the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, stimulation of inflammatory transcription factors, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and generation of excessive ROS. However, OxPLs are potent inhibitors of acute inflammation mediated by the TLR family. A specific group of cyclopenthenone-containing OxPLs that include PEIPC and PECPC induces potent barrier-protective responses in the vascular ECs and inhibits hyperpermeability induced by edemagenic agonists, which are mediators of inflammation and pathologic mechanical strain. Thus, increased OxPL levels observed in the course of acute inflammation, such as bacterial infection or acute tissue injury, may represent a negative feedback mechanism that leads to the downregulation of cellular inflammatory cascades. Additional screening and characterization of OxPL compounds with barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory properties and synthesis of bioactive OxPL derivates with stabilized structure may be an exciting area of research that could potentially lead to a new group of pharmacologic molecules beneficial for the treatment of VILI, acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung inflammation, and other diseases associated with increased vascular leakage.",
