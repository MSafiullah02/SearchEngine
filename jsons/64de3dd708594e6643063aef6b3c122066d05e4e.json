            "text": "In recent work we reported the vibrational spectrum of more than 100,000 known protein structures, and a self-consistent sonification method to render the spectrum in the audible range of frequencies (Extreme Mechanics Letters, 2019). Here we present a method to transform these molecular vibrations into materialized vibrations of thin water films using acoustic actuators, leading to complex patterns of surface waves, and using the resulting macroscopic images in further processing using deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the patterns of water surface waves for each protein structure is used to build training sets for neural networks, aimed to classify and further process the patterns. Once trained, the neural network model is capable of discerning different proteins solely by analyzing the macroscopic surface wave patterns in the water film. Not only can the method distinguish different types of proteins (e.g. alpha-helix vs hybrids of alpha-helices and beta-sheets), but it is also capable of determining different folding states of the same protein, or the binding events of proteins to ligands. Using the DeepDream algorithm, instances of key features of the deep neural network can be made visible in a range of images, allowing us to explore the inner workings of protein surface wave patter neural networks, as well as the creation of new images by finding and highlighting features of protein molecular spectra in a range of photographic input. The integration of the water-focused realization of cymatics, combined with neural networks and especially generative methods, offer a new direction to realize materiomusical \"Inceptionism\" as a possible direction in nano-inspired art. The method could have applications for detecting different protein structures, the effect of mutations, or uses in medical imaging and diagnostics, with broad impact in nano-to-macro transitions.",

            "text": "Proteins are the basic building blocks of life. They form materials as diverse silk, cells, and hair, but also offering other functions from enzymes to drugs, and pathogens like viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . While we cannot see small nanoscopic objects like proteins or other molecules, a common feature is their continuous motion, or vibration, that can be understood as an overlay of fundamental normal modes each consisting of harmonic waves. In recent work [1] we reported the vibrational spectrum of more than 100,000 known protein structures, and a self-consistent sonification method to render their complex vibrational spectrum in the audible range of frequencies. The sonification work has also been used to train generative neural networks to facilitate the design of de novo proteins using machine learning [2, 7] . This article focuses on a different perspective and reports a distinct, complementary and translational approach, in which we transform these molecular vibrations into vibrations of thin water films using acoustic actuators, leading to visual images of complex materialized patterns of surface waves. This approach follows the pioneering concept developed by Chladni [8] and is similar to the cymatics method [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , offers a distinct means to assess the molecular details of protein vibrations in the form of macroscopic vibrations visible to our eyes. In addition to potential applications in outreach, the physical manifestation of molecular vibrations at the macroscale provides a novel avenue to render sound visible, providing an alternative method to conventional musical notation [11] and novel interactive approaches to interact with sound using senses other than our ears [15] [16] [17] [18] . Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence provides an exciting avenue to classify, process and understand, or augment images generated by sound. We will explore some of these augmentation concepts in this paper, by highlighting key features of images as detected by distinct layers in deep neural networks. These connections between sound, materialization and images can offer many avenues for future research, enabled by significant progress made in recent years in computer vision [2, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Figure 1A shows the overall flow of the research reported here. The approach includes the calculation of molecular vibrational spectra transposed to audible frequencies and made audible (see earlier work for details, [1, 6] ), which are then used to excite a thin film of water. Images of surface wave patterns are collected, building a training set for a machine learning model. The predictive power of the classifier model is validated, showing that the model can correctly determine the protein structure solely based on images of the surface wave patterns. Figure 1B depicts an overview of eight distinct protein structures (chosen to reflect different complexity and size in its molecular structure) that are investigated in this paper.",

Figure 1B depicts an overview of all proteins considered in this study, where the first row represents relatively simple structures (added complexity from left (short alpha-helix) to right (more complex alpha-helical fold). The lower row features more complex protein structures, including two spike proteins from the pathogen of COVID-19 (two distinct molecular states -6vxx and 6vsb of COVID-19), as well as the COVID-19 spike protein bound (6m17) and unbound (6m18) to the human ACE2 receptor. Figure 5 depicts the results of the training process for both neural network formulations. Both cases show reasonable convergence. The pre-trained ResNet case ( Figure 5A ) converges faster and in a more stable manner, however. This makes sense given that the model starts from pre-trained parameters. Figure 6 shows results of a classification test suite conducted with the two trained models, depicting averaged values for a series of unknown, new images, fed to the neural network. The radar plot shows the score for each of the 13 labels (each is denoted out of 1.00). The data shows that both models predict the case very well, and without error. It can also be seen that the score for the correct prediction is quite pronounced, showing that the classifier works very well and can distinctly classify the correct protein structure at the origin of the acoustic actuation. This can be verified by the fact that the highest score in the plot is close to 1.00, and that there is a distinct peak for each of the cases.",

The highest score, in both models, is for the label 1akg, which indicates correct classification. For 3tnu, the highest score is 3tnu, and so on. Notably, both models are capable of predicting the correct labels, solely from images of surface waves, for all cases studied. It is remarkable that the method works for a variety of protein structures with distinct frequency spectra from complex to simple including the pure sine wave cases at different frequencies. It also renders correct predictions for proteins with distinct geometric dimensions. For instance, 1akg is a very small protein that features only a simple fold and a short alpha-helix segment. 3tnu is a small alpha-helix fragment without any folding. In contrast, 6vsb is a very large protein. Other interesting cases are 6m17 and 6m18. The protein 6m17 shows only minute distinctions from 6m18 in terms of its vibrational spectrum, as is shown in Figure 7 . Yet, the model can distinguish the cases very well. Figure 10 shows a similar experiment, this time applied to the same image, but considering the result for using individual layers to generate features. The collection of examples of images visualize features seen by the internal layers of the deep neural network, by selecting different layers. Figure 11 shows an analysis of images with DeepDream,using the Inception deep neural network [19] . Unlike in the cases discussed above, here the neural network model used is taken \"as trained\" against a large number of conventional images (and has not been trained against the dataset reported here). It is clear that the conventional image classification model features very distinct patterns, reflecting the characteristic features learned in a conventional image classifier. It offers interesting insights into what image features are seen by a model like Inception in the abstract representation of surface wave patterns induced by proteins.",

More broadly, looking ahead, the method can find applications as a means to accentuate images, find patterns in other biomaterials, or to use the approach in detecting patterns across manifestations of domains. Figure 1 : A, Overall flow of this research, ranging from the molecular vibrational spectra transposed to audible frequencies, and used to excite a thin film of water using an actuator. Images of surface wave patterns are collected, building a training set for a machine learning model. The predictive power of the classifier model is validated, showing that the model can correctly determine the protein structure solely based on images of the surface wave patterns. B, overview of the various proteins studied in this paper. The first row represents relatively simple structures (added complexity from left (short alpha-helix) to right (more complex alpha-helical fold). The lower row features more complex protein structures, including two spike proteins from coronaviruses (6vxx and 6vsb of COVID-19), as well as the COVID-19 spike protein bound (6m17) and unbound (6m18) to the human ACE2 receptor.",

A think water film in a petri dish is excited by an actuator, resulting in surface waves, as can be seen in the right column labelled \"Top\". The resulting structures are captured using a high-resolution camera, and collected as a training set for machine learning. : Results of the classifier as applied to a new data set that wasn't included in training or validation. The data is plotted in a radar plot (1.0 = the neural network is capable of correctly labeling the image, 0.0 reflects worst performance). We plot averaged scores, providing average values over classifications for multiple images. The data shows that both neural networks are capable of identifying different protein structures, as well as the test cases of sine waves (at different frequencies), as well as silence. For instance, the orange color represents the scores for 1akg. The highest score, in both models, is for the label 1akg, which indicates correct classification. For 3tnu, the highest score is 3tnu, and so on. Both models are capable of predicting the correct labels, solely from images of surface waves, for all cases studied. In spite of the small differences in the structure and the frequency spectrum as depicted in the figure, the machine learning model is capable of easily distinguishing the patterns generated from these audio signals.

This approach offers a new way to design generative art from molecular vibrations. The method can be applied to various detailed aspects, including an analysis of images of surface waves from the experiment, or the analysis of other, distinct images. The method can be viewed as a means of reflections of molecular vibrational pattern identification in other image sources. The examples depicted here show how the method can accentuate photographs of water, but also entirely different objects and landscapes. It can be seen that when fed images of the type of the original images of thin water layers vibrating, the model recognizes the patterns and overlays these quite well on top of it(Figure 8, left column). In the other examples, the fit is not as good, even though the model still captures relevant features in these images.",

The data is plotted in a radar plot (1.0 = the neural network is capable of correctly labeling the image, 0.0 reflects worst performance). We plot averaged scores, providing average values over classifications for multiple images. The data shows that both neural networks are capable of identifying different protein structures, as well as the test cases of sine waves (at different frequencies), as well as silence. For instance, the orange color represents the scores for 1akg. The highest score, in both models, is for the label 1akg, which indicates correct classification. For 3tnu, the highest score is 3tnu, and so on. Both models are capable of predicting the correct labels, solely from images of surface waves, for all cases studied.",
