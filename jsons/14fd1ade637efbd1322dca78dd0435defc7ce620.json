We propose to use a variant of the well known SEIR model to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in France, by taking in to account the national lockdown declared in March 11, 2020. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is used to find optimal parameters for the model in the case of France. We propose to fit the model based only on the number of daily fatalities, where an R 2 score based error metric is used. As the official number of confirmed cases is not reliable due to the lack of widespread testing, especially in the first phases of the outbreak, we show that basing the model optimisation on the number of fatalities can provide legitimate results.",

A nation-wide, strict lockdown has been initiated on March 17 and was announced to continue till May 11. By April 22, there are around 159,000 confirmed cases and 20,800 deaths caused by COVID- 19 . French government has announced that [9] [10] lockdown will be lifted starting on May 11 , with strict measures. The exact details of the lockdown lifting policy are not publicized yet, however it is known that the allowed proportion of population and the commercial and public establishments will be gradually increased week by week. The reopening date of high risk establishments such as restaurants or schools is still unknown. It would not be speculative to state that the reproduction number R 0 will also increase gradually over this period, however we expect that it will be much lower compared to pre-lockdown values due to increased awareness and public health measures.",

We have made the assumption to use two different reproduction numbers: R b 0 and R q 0 . R b 0 is used to describe reproduction rate between the first confirmed death until the start of the lockdown and R q 0 from the start to the end of the lockdown. The parameters of the model are fitted using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [13] [14] . However, unlike other approaches we have decided to base our optimization on the number of fatalities only. In addition, rather than Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE); we minimize an R 2 score based metric [15] for daily deaths. The rationale behind this approach is that due to largely unknown dynamics of the novel coronavirus such as degree of infectiousness, length of incubation period and limited testing capability, using confirmed cases with such limited information may highly disrupt the validity of the model. However, the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is much more definitive, especially in the first days of the outbreak and thus expected to increase the accuracy. Note that, with this approach the initial state values are also defined in terms of proportion of fatalities, hence they also are parameters of the PSO optimization.",

Using the developed model we predict that if lockdown continues with strict measures, the total number of COVID-19 fatalities should topple below 50,000 (which is currently around 20,000) by late August, 2020; where the effects of the epidemic start to significantly diminish. As it is not possible to predict the reproduction number for the forthcoming lockdown lift, we propose two scenarii with a reproduction number increase of respectively 5% and 10% per week during 3 consecutive weeks. For these two scenarii, it is estimated that total number of fatalities may reach up to 70,000-80,000, and that an epidemic situation could continue till November, 2020.",

The SEIR model is classified as a closed dynamical epidemiological model, as it divides the total population into four distinct categories, where the proportion of individuals belonging to each category evolves over time, subjects passing from one state to other. The temporal transitions between states are defined by several differential equations [11] . Initially, the entire population is considered as susceptible except very few infected individuals. Gradually over time, according to base differential equations, susceptible individuals are exposed to disease, proportional to the reproduction number R 0 . Exposed subjects get infected, recover or die also based on the scalar parameters used in base differential equations. Generally, these parameters are calculated for the considered case using optimization algorithms [21] . In the past, researchers have also developed noteworthy number of extended SEIR/SIR models, where additional number of states are added, considering the special circumstances of the evaluated epidemic [18] [22] . We further explain the statistical formulation of an extended SEIR model in the next section.",

As mentioned previously, the most definitive data for COVID-19 case is the number of fatalities, due to current lack of pathological and epidemiological information about the disease and the low number of tests. Especially, in the first phase of dissemination of the virus in France, the number of tests was much lower, further decreasing the validity of using confirmed cases as a model initiator. Therefore, we propose to estimate the initial number of infected people, I(t 0 ) from the initial number of fatalities D(t 0 ), by simply reverse tracing the state transition diagram, using the proportion of hospitalized H(t 0 ) and critical C(t 0 ) cases. It is important to note that these proportion constants are parameters of the SEIR-HCD model we aim to optimize along a temporal axis. In other words, one novel outcome of our proposed algorithm is to be able to intrinsically calculate the initial number of infected citizens. It is highly reasonable to indicate that the number of infected people at the time where the first confirmed cases are announced shall be exponentially higher, due to very high proportion of asymptomatic cases [27] .",

These results are particularly interesting, since our SEIR model optimization approach with suggested error metric for number of fatalities is able to converge to the optimal point, and directly coronavirus related metrics such as incubation period, hospitalisation period etc. (assuming demographics etc. of a country does not influence considerably) are close to the average of the previous works.
