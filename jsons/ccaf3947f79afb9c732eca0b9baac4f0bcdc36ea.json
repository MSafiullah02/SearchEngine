Tropical medicine has caused unnecessary debate among African health experts and the former colonizers, or others, who have used the two words loosely. It is important that this distraction from the real health issues be dealt with here before it causes further confusion when addressing the most important concepts of public health, medicine, and global health. This much we know on the controversy. It is agreed that the concept of tropical medicine started during the nineteenth century in British, French, and German laboratories and schools of medicine whose primary motive was to care for the health of the army and the European administration living in tropical climates, as is the case of 80% of the African continent. However, in trying to solve the problem of ill health, the pioneers of the tropical effort focused on disease without seriously thinking about the socioeconomic factors responsible for certain disease clusters and the various pathogenic agents.",

It is widely accepted today, for example, that in Africa, many of the contagious diseases, such as syphilis and smallpox, spread to the interior from the coast-the preferred place for Europeans-which allowed the newcomers to control the shipping industry, the welcoming and enhancement of the arrival of more colonizers, and the discharging of laborers from one area of the continent to another. The reasons and impact of the stigma associated with several diseases, such as leprosy and mental illness, and how to combat them received little attention then. Sadly, this neglect continued even with the emergence African universities and medical schools at the end of the colonial period. In fact, the spread of such diseases as influenza is related to population density and people's relation to disease vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, helminthes, and lice, resource allocation, social interaction, and relationships of power that influence social organization and space, and not simply to geographic characteristics, climate, and tropical location (Niang 2008: 29) .",

For one, some maintain that \"tropical medicine has connection with [an] international [domain] ,\" which is somewhat inaccurate, because one can focus on tropical medicine [or public health] and not necessarily transcend a country's or colonial national boundaries. Due to its connection with the early years of colonialism, as noted above, tropical medicine originated among interested colonial doctors and scientists in England who described the state of Africa's health negatively while portraying themselves as the saviors of the continent. Eddleston notes in this context that, when the organization of European Schools of Tropical Medicine (TropMed Europe) met in Addis Ababa in 1997, \"we were persuaded by our African colleagues that the term 'tropical medicine' still had patronizing colonial overtones and should be replaced by 'international medicine' although this decision was never implemented\" (Eddleston 2011: vi) . Prominent historian Roy Porter (1997: 462) objected to the use of the concept as it created the wrong impression of \"Intrepid doctors going off to the steaming jungles and overcoming some of the most lethal diseases besetting mankind,\" as the greatest benefactors to mankind (Eddleston et al. 2011: v) . To be sure, tropical medicine was defined by Manson in 1898 as the branch of medicine that focuses on the diseases \"occurring only, or which from one circumstance or another are specially prevalent, in warm climates,\" requiring \"the necessary skills and experience needed to meet its special challenges: the zoology of vectors and reservoirs, hygiene, anthropology, economics, epidemiology and demographics as the mainstream medical sciences.\"",

            "text": "No wonder the replacement of the concept of tropical medicine with that of \"international medicine\" was never adopted. Indeed, talking about international medicine makes little sense because, as the preceding authors noted, tropical medicine asks several questions whose answers are extremely relevant to such continents as Africa, including those that are not in the tropics: issues of medicine chain; impact of the heat on medication; drying a blood film or staining a malaria film; stabilizing airways obstruction by using a \"a bloody tracheotomy\"; weighing patients quickly in a humid temperature; operating a hospital without electricity and clean water; sanitizing and sterilizing hospital needles and similar equipment; applying the technique of weighing patients and monitoring their fluid balance \"at the most peripheral levels of the health service\"; avoiding contamination in situations where water is scarce; and improving the methods that might offset the impact of mosquitoes, flies, rodents, germs, and parasites that thrive in humid climates and wet areas. These and myriad other health-related issues are important or less critical where geography presents advantages or disadvantages for managing health care more efficiently and more effectively. Thus, even though tropical medicine has local, international, and even global implications, it need not be international: it may be simply national or regional depending on its specific focus. This means that in dealing with diseases health experts must go beyond the concept because it is narrow in approach and confuses those who see health as determined by more factors than climate. In short, one must be careful when using the concept of tropical disease or diseases, which should mean that certain diseases are common in certain geographical locations and not that all found in such locations are tropical, as is the case with HIV/AIDS and SARS. Additionally, diseases appearing in cooler climates are not necessarily non-tropical, as many can adapt to any climate. As the world continues to shrink, the distinction between tropical and non-tropical becomes less accurate. Finally, one must consider genetic predisposition of an individual born in a tropical or cooler climate when trying to classify the disease.",

In the US, the resistance to imposing or promoting certain behaviors that public health professionals, practitioners, and advocates request is heightened when politicians and policy-makers claim that the field should be the domain of states rather than the federal government. This ideology has, for a long time, hurt the government's ability to act as the most important agent for the protection of people's health. In the US, such type of thinking is clearly underscored by the continued controversy over President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in March 2010 and declared constitutional by the Supreme Court in 2012. The attempt by the opponents to repeal this law without suggesting any alternative comes from nothing else but an ideological framework that is based on the premise that health and access to (quality) care is not a right of all people, and that the poor and the unhealthy must be held responsible for their condition, for which they are to blame in a social environment that asks each citizen to fend for himself-an echo of sociologist Herbert' and anthropologist Darwin's theory of the \"survival of the fittest.\" If this is the basis of social behavior and assessment of how suffering fellow global citizens should be handled, the federal government has no legitimate authority over legislation on health. However, if one were to follow this logic to the extreme, as is the case among certain US politicians and pharmaceutical conglomerates, then one could simply posit that no state, federal, locality, or community has the right to regulate people's lives in so far as health is concerned and that only the individual can determine by himself his own conduct, even if this may result in an epidemic or a pandemic outbreak that affects everyone else. Such thinking demonstrates how absurd or unwise it is to reject the tenets and the sociopolitical requisites of public health. It is fortunate, at least for now, that this debate has not permeated discussions over the power of the African governments to legislate, survey, monitor, evaluate, fund, and advocate for certain types of policies designed to protect the health of the community and, consequently, that of the individual. This non-combative attitude in Africa has its roots in the colonial authoritarian regimes Africans inherited, the family and community-based traditions prevalent on the continent prior to the imposition of a system that focused on individualist capitalism interested only in the accumulation of material goods regardless of the methods used, one that sought instant or visible gratification brought about by the public health system. In the long run, however, a populationbased approach is less expensive than a focus on individual disease cases and individual well-being.",

Yet, even today, some still consider it to be too utopian and, therefore, unattainable. The WHO defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of diseases.\" In the context of such a definition, health is a positive concept that makes its opposite, ill health, undesirable, even if the ill person does not suffer from a disease. A person with a broken arm or a slight injury from a car crash does not have a disease but he is not healthy either. In the same vein, an individual who has an infection that does not develop into a disease is not in \"health;\" he or she is, instead, unhealthy.",

For a long time, in fact, mental disease remained neglected by the medical profession and even public health practitioners and scholars, and policy-makers globally, including the West. As a positive concept, the United Nations (UN) definition emphasizes the point that \"social and personal resources as well as physical capabilities\" are all important elements for the health of the community (Lloyd and Morrow 2010) . Public health is precisely what the two words mean, that is, \"the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being\" of the public \"and not merely the absence of disease\" in its midst.

However, it is agreed that definitions must be concise, precise, and relatively brief, while containing the essential elements that make something what it is, presenting a form of existence and operation that are unique to the subject been defined. In this light, Novick and Brown's definition seems to be too general to the extent that it needs some elaboration. Some definitions note, for example, that public health relies on a combination of science and art. Suppose there is no science, does one still have public health? What is science and who defines it? Can a community have public health without the element of art? What is art and who defines art? Aristotle gave us a simple principle for defining something: showing the specific genus and its unique species. By defining public health the way we have done over the past three decades or so, Africa and the less developed world may not have public health, which is only acceptable as long as we maintain the Eurocentric definition of science and art.",

Indeed, did Hippocrates, the so-called father of modern (Western) medicine, or Thucydides, who wrote about epidemics in his part of the world of the time, have the scientific and technical knowledge expected to prevent disease and promote health?

(Winslow 1920) Winslow caused more confusion than was needed when presenting a definition that seems to cause more problems than it clarifies the essence of the field of public health with its many functions, means, strategies, goals, disciplines, and desired outcomes, interjecting the word individual, which takes the essence of public health away, namely, from its primary focus on the community and populations, or the public. Winslow's definition has received such negative criticism that renowned sociologist Paul Starr called it a downright subversive \"-a conception [that is, if taken seriously, is an invitation to conflict.\" Starr continues his criticism: \"Public health cannot make all these activities its own, without, someone, sooner or later, violating private beliefs or private property or the prerogative of other institutions\u2026Much of the history of public health is a record of struggles over the limits of its mandate\" (Starr 1982: 180) . Starr further adds that, in the past, religious organizations opposed public health because it was perceived as officially introducing its own concepts of health and hygiene, while businessmen and merchants did not welcome the emerging field as they perceived it as encroaching upon their domain. At the end of the nineteenth century, physicians also vehemently objected to the impression that public health was infringing on the core of their medical profession.",

            "text": "This writer found an interesting definition that seems to present fewer problems and little confusion. Samantha Battams defined the \"new\" public health as \"the sum of activities undertaken by societies, occurring both within in and beyond the health system and health sector, to promote health and prevent disease\" (Battams 2014) . Thus defined, public health may be applicable to even ancient societies, including those found in Africa, because it does not make essential the subjective Western understanding of science, technology, and medical practices, as the identifying elements of the concept. The WHO makes two points in its discussion of the evolution of the field of public health and its belated acceptance as a one that the public needed, making a major contrast with the medical field and the unchallenged role of physicians. Battams notes that, for a long time, particularly in the aftermath of the Second World War, The nature of health issues became increasingly more medical and professional. The discovery of new drugs and other irrefutable medical progress laid the foundations for a strong belief in the ability of doctors and the health services to solve all the major health problems. Health policy became increasingly synonymous with medical care policy, with the debates centering on how we should finance and recruit personnel to an ever-swelling hospital sector. (WHO, Commission on Social Determinants 2000) However, during the 1980s, public health began to have a stronger hand in tackling health problems that endangered the health of people, and it thus turned out to be a more respected field. In fact, several institutions and medical schools began offering degrees in the field. First, communities were disillusioned by the medical profession because diseases they expected to be contained or eradicated were still around, causing a heavy death toll, disability, and misery. This appeared to show both the impotency of physicians and the weakness of their clinical treatment of patients faced with infectious and non-communicable diseases. This understanding was highlighted and sharpened by the HIV/AIDS pandemic outbreak. Second was the fact that, for treatment and cure, enormous amounts of personal and governmental funds were being spent for years indefinitely, always escalating to such an extent that many people were unable to pay for the services they wished to receive. Third, while it was clear that the rich had a better chance of surviving disease and illness, the poor continued to lag behind no matter how often some of the socioeconomic barriers might be arrested.",

As the WHO has hastened to add, \"Using health determinants as the basic means, the vast majority of public health must take place outside the medical care service,\" or \"outside the spheres of medical competence and knowledge\" (see Krieger 2011: 291) . In an effort to rebut those who claimed that using the stick of inequity or disparity was interfering with the scientific requisites of ideological neutrality, the WHO's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (2008) added this strong statement: \"Our core concerns with health equity must be part of the global community, health equity, and the urgency of dealing with climate change\u2026When it comes to influencing unemployment figures, social security, housing segregation and alcohol habits, decisions taken in municipal assemblies and other democratic bodies play a much more important role than efforts made in the medical sector\u2026The overarching aim is to create the conditions for good health on equal terms for the entire population.\"",

First, it places the state at center stage, implying that, with no state, there is no public health. It further stresses the role of the \"modern state\" rather than simply any state or any society that functions at the margins of society. Furthermore, the two authors restrict the term to the application of \"modern, scientific medicine, and its administration through the use of rational principles.\" The problem, however, is that this conception of public health rules out any system in Africa or elsewhere prior to colonialism, especially among societies that had an egalitarian character or were stateless, such as the Ibo of Nigeria, given its emphasis on the modern state, the adoption of Eurocentric principles of science, and a \"rational\" type of administration that refers to the way the Western world has organized the conduct of health care through structures that are often too bureaucratic, unaccountable, voracious, and universalistic, allowing for no exceptions for population segments, and culturally unsound. This description of public health and its role is problematic also in so far as pre-colonial and pre-modern African medical practices are concerned. Indeed, concerted initiatives aimed at preserving, promoting, and treating disease in populations were common and intricate parcels of health practices on the African continent prior to the Atlantic slave trade during the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries and the scramble for Africa during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century .",

Medicine or clinical practice, on the contrary, focuses primarily on the health of the individual and treatment of disease in clinical settings, to the extent that caring or curing one individual may not necessarily improve the health of the community. Medicine is, in a sense, a private, confidential, and individual practice, whereas public health is a communal act intended to prevent and control or eradicate all risks harmful to health-now commonly called the social and environmental determinants of health following official endorsement of the concept by the WHO in 2008. Public health is, therefore, uniquely suited to highlight the interplay between all factors and sectors of life that are related to the health or ill health of populations. Public health clearly calls for an integrated approach of activity to one of the most important aspects of life, health.",

That's public health.\" This statement cannot be more illustrative of the differences between the two fields.

It would seem ideal to include more medicine in public health but the suggestion has been opposed by the medical profession.

Including this element as a part of the definition would eliminate passive definitions that, leaving the agency out, would appear as coming out of the blue. Agency often comes from one health-focused individual, professional, researcher, or a small group of individuals. This needs prominence in the discussion of both medicine and public health. After noting that the public health profession differs from the clinical health professions in that the former encompasses many professional disciplines such as medicine, dentistry, nursing, optometry, nutrition, social work, environmental health sciences, health education, health services administration and the behavioral sciences, Medicine Network notes that its activities focus on entire populations rather than on individual patients (Medicine Network 2014). Another way of expressing the most effective way of improving the health of all is targeting \"geographic or otherwise defined populations, as an organizing principle.\" In fact, physicians have of late implicitly and explicitly acknowledged the importance of public health by enrolling in public health programs where they upgrade their knowledge and skills regarding, for example, the measurements of disease and its impact on populations, better understanding of the etiology of illness, and familiarity with the most recent best practices in the evolution of medicine itself and its application to the needs of the community at large.

This problem has been clearly highlighted by the dispute between some American doctors who deal with the Ebola virus treatment and European companies that have tried to discover drugs or vaccines against the deadly disease that erupted in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea recently as to the ethical process to prove the effectiveness and safety of a recommended intervention. Some experts, such as Dr. Kalil of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, argue that double-blind randomized trials that use drugs and placebos in a case-control study of diseases, such as Ebola, are the only ethical studies acceptable, of which Africa is being short-changed. As Nicole Lurie, US Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response put it, \"We recognize the need for compassion and quick access to effective drugs for those in need,\u2026but history has taught that the best approach is to conduct rigorous controlled trials to determine both safety and effectiveness\" (The Wall Street Journal, May 13 2015: A7).

The most important caveat for anyone studying, reading, and applying public health is that this field has elements of natural and social science and the arts, the latter including the ability to assemble and integrate components of health to make results plausible or reasonable enough when weighed against science, strengthened by common sense and deeply embedded knowledge of people's behavior and culture.

These changes resulted in unprecedented population growth and consequently overcrowding in the cities, the appearance of slums, increased poverty among those who could not make it in the urban enclaves, the rapid spread of infectious diseases, and, therefore, in more deaths than expected. The result of the industrial revolution prompted Thomas Malthus to posit that, even though the population of England was growing too rapidly, death would be a natural balancing factor and that therefore there was no need of trying to slow down its impact. This thinking was disputed by many, including the emerging epidemiologists such as John Graunt, through his 1662 Bills of Mortality (his observations on mortality statistics from a plague outbreak in the City of London captured in government registries), and, later, William Farr, at times also known as one of the founders of modern epidemiology. Equally important is mentioning the British epidemiologist John Snow, who changed our perception of disease and suggested the ways to combat it. Thus, up until the 1980s, the consensus has been that epidemiology was born in England and \"exported\" to the New World, especially the US, as most of the first public health professionals including physicians were British and American.",

Consequently, epidemiologists are known for having developed and spread the perception of the role of their discipline in reference to the measurement of disease and disease impact, risk factors, and exposure, which are accomplished through especially designed approaches, such as cohort and case-control studies, clinical trials, observational and cross-sectional surveys to determine what they call the relative risk and the odds ratio, rate, frequency, percentage, incidence, prevalence, life expectancy at birth, disease incubation period, morbidity, mortality, disability, secular (long-term) trends, seasonality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). As a result, there are many types of studies that epidemiologists conduct to find health risks, sources of contagion and infection, types of diseases and their virulence, and their likely frequency and side effects, the nature of the disease environment, the appropriately administered and recommended remedies, interventions, or treatment. On one hand, stand the important epidemiological observational studies which are based on events or episodes that might trigger a response in people's immune system and impact their health status. In observational studies, the search is for the observable variables or data to understand or explain the likely outcome-that is, good health, infection, infectivity, disability, disease, or death. Descriptive studies, on the other hand, simply describe or narrate what has been observed, searching for answers to the research questions posed, namely, who, when, and where, regarding a specific disease that manifests itself in a given population or in a series of undesirable or unexpected individual cases.",

This criticism may have been justified some time ago but not currently because of peer review requirements and the level of improved and sophisticated methodologies in the field of public health. Critics must also remember that it is easier to study inanimate objects and non-humans than humans and societies, because of the latter's ability to manipulate data and information, conceal facts, hide feelings, and harbor preconceived or biased ideas. One might agree that it is much more difficult to be absolutely sure of one's \"scientific\" conclusions when dealing with people. Indeed, the inherent and potential problems apply to all sociobehavioral sciences, which have prompted Sharma Rausch, a Ph.D. psychologist at the US Homeland Security, heading the Human Factors/Behavioral Analysis Division at the Science & Technology Directorate, to affirm that it is the social sciences that are the harder sciences and not the natural sciences, which, more accurately, according to her, should be called the \"softer sciences\" and not the other way around. Summing up, as FAO says, \"Inherent in the epidemiological approach is the belief that the frequency of occurrence of a disease in a population is governed by the interaction of a large number of different factors or determinants. Epidemiologists believe that by studying these interactions it may become possible to manipulate some of the determinants involved and so reduce the frequency with which the disease in question occurs in a population\" (FAO 2015: 1). As John Last wrote in 2002, epidemiology is an \"indispensable basic science of public health. It provides the logical framework for the facts that enable public health officials to identify important public health problems and to delineate their dimensions. Epidemiologic methods are used to define these health problems; to classify, identify, and elucidate their causes; and to plan and evaluate rational control measures\" (Last 2002: 1) .",

As expected, in the course of its long evolution since the mid-eighteenth century but particularly the nineteenth century and thereafter, following the firm entrenchment of the germ theory of disease (Kunitz 2007: 12) , epidemiology has accumulated its own theoretical base derived from the series of studies it has conducted, many of which have resulted in the discovery and announcements of irrefutable or probable causes or association among risk exposure, infection, disease, disability, or death. One thing is clear at this juncture, namely, that true epidemiology is based on rigorous methods or protocols set for collecting data and information, selecting the subjects for studies, analyzing, interpreting, or synthesizing the results or findings. As Nancy Krieger notes, \"scientific observation [in epidemiology] is not a passive phenomenon of what we 'see' and our technical capacity to do so\u2026 In one sense, this means that meaningful observation is, at some level, theory-laden: what we 'see' depends in part on what our ideas are about what we expect to see and what assumptions underlie the methods used to 'observe' the data\" (Krieger 2011: 24) . What constitutes the wrong or unethical approach in epidemiological studies is the manipulation of the results or the research process itself to suit preconceived ideas or ideologies, as some social and even natural scientists have been accused of doing, reflected, for example, in the vehement attacks from some conservative circles on those scientists that claim that climate change is a hoax designed to advance their liberal theories.",

            "text": "Observational cohort studies follow in time a group of individuals who have been exposed to the same risk factor or factors, have similar genetic predisposition (if known), and who perhaps live in the same environment, but are not yet ill, to find out who is more susceptible to an exposure. However, cohort studies tend to be more expensive than others and must therefore be crafted very carefully because they may require a long followup and a large sample. This is where the concept of relative risk (RR) is used. In contrast, a case-control study is simply a cross-sectional observational retrospective study that uses subjects who have already suffered the impact of an exposure, weighed against healthy individuals-the control group-which is suspected of having been exposed to the same risk. The goal is to find the causes or the associations that might have resulted in disease or death. The major group of interest here is actually the case and not the control group, in an attempt to find out why they turned sick or died. A case-control study may not need a large sample, and therefore tends to be cheaper, and does not require follow-up like the cohort study, and the determination of risk is done through the odds ratio (OR) that provides the ratio of likelihood that a non-exposed person in the control group versus one exposed individual in the case group may end up contracting the disease. In contrast, a valid clinical trial, which is designed to answer the questions what, where, when, how, why, who, and which, requires a randomized selection of individuals who share the same exposures and risks and who have other similar characteristics that make them equally qualified to be participants in the study. Most often, a clinical trial requires some type of blinding of the subjects, the investigators, and often the analysts, a process called triple blinding, to ensure that the results are not biased. Blinded individuals will not know in advance who was subjected to an intervention, such as a drug or a vaccine, and who was administered a placebo (Bhuyan et al. 2015: 254) .",

In other words, the epidemiologist's ultimate goal before divulging his or her findings is to find what is called the \"web of causation,\" even though often the relationship between the event and outcome is more of an association than of causality or cause and effect. The minimum requirement of his or her research or detective activity is to at least find scientific probability. Thus, as a detective, the epidemiologist protects the lives of a population through consistent disease surveillance and by being the first source of information and analysis when an unexpected disease outbreak occurs in a locality. Most of the epidemiologists are also part of the other public health disciplines and serve as physicians, as is the case in Africa. However, this unwise or necessary imposition of responsibilities overworks them, often resulting in little time for research.",

Many of the studies require considerable funding, particularly if they are cohort studies or clinical trials, and involve fieldwork. Therefore, the rigor of the research techniques, study relevance, and ability to acquire funding are major hurdles in the conduct of most studies. These are constraints that all developing countries, including those in Africa, face daily. Funding shortages, the dearth of trained personnel, slow turn-around permission from the authorities to conduct research, unnecessary bureaucracy, poor and decaying, dilapidated infrastructure, and obstacles generated by ethnic preferences, make it very difficult for African scholars to undertake and complete meaningful and externally valid studies. Sheba Gate et al. note that, among others, one of the many shortcomings of epidemiological endeavors in Africa \"\u2026is the weakness of the public health (and clinical) laboratory networks which are critical for effective public health surveillance especially for communicable diseases\" (Gate et al. 2011: 1).",

The journal found out, for example, that from 1991 to 2010, epidemiologic research as a part of public health research in the WHO/AFRO region increased from 172 to 1086. At first glance, the increased number seems impressive but it amounts to only 50 articles per year for the whole continent during a period of 19 years. Moreover, most of the epidemiological studies or research projects are done within the context of public health and not epidemiology per se, and focus almost exclusively on infectious diseases, designed only to \"control health problems.\" Researchers very rarely join hands with researchers from the other sociobehavioral sciences, which would increase and sharpen their work output. Another weakness comes from the fact that most of the research and the training of epidemiologists in Africa are overwhelmingly sponsored by the international organizations, invariably originating from the US, the European Community, and Australia.",

Unfortunately, the training has focused only on the Master's degree level and virtually none on the Ph.D. or Dr.P.H. To acquire one of these advanced two degrees in epidemiology, the candidate must go abroad. Even more frustrating is that, in Africa itself, there are only a few funding organizations for the epidemiologists' work, and include the WHO and The Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania The international Council on Health Research and Development (COHRED) network focuses on \"strengthening national and instructional governance of research and innovation for health, equity, and development in low-middle and middle-income countries worldwide and has a strong presence in Sub-Saharan Africa,\" stressing advocacy, ethics, and provision of public health information (Nachega et al. 2012: 11) . To improve the situation of the discipline of epidemiology in Africa, the authors of the article cited recommend the offering of more public health programs on the continent, with epidemiology occupying a prominent role, and the creation of regional or national centers of excellence that would focus on epidemiological research activities and collaboration with other centers internationally, while actively engaging in funding search. The authors were less critical of the leadership in Africa, however, which this author believes is a disappointing omission, as nothing will be done in this respect until the leaders see the value of public health and the need for training a sufficient workforce, with particular emphasis on producing competent epidemiologists, while providing enough resources to build schools of public health, with epidemiology as one of the most needed sociobehavioral science disciplines.",

The dogged reliance on expatriates and NGOs to conduct the research they need makes them continue to be the servile appendages of the latter's petty projects.

Public health nutrition, or nutrition in public health, is a population-based discipline that focuses on proper diet, compares nutrition with health status, monitors food and diet activities or programs, and \"provides a leadership in applying public health principles to activities that lead to health promotion and disease prevention through policy development and environmental changes\" (Spark 2007: 3) . Spark alerts us about the distinction between the concepts of nutrition and public health and nutrition in public health or public health nutrition. Nutrition and public health denotes an independent discipline or a discipline co-existent alongside public health. Even though the two may be separately considered at times, they are normally used synonymously and fit the definition provided above. As a public health discipline, nutrition's ultimate functions are the surveillance and monitoring of risk factors, employing a community-focused approach for assessment, program planning, evaluation, leadership and population based interventions, and leadership in promoting access and quality related to the nutritional needs of a population. For Africa, this discipline is absolutely critical. Malnutrition affects over half of Africa and is responsible for most underweight at birth as well as for older children, who, as a result, grow stunted and are unable to combat disease due to a compromised immune system that normally should help them fight infectious and chronic diseases.",

Studies suggest that there is a relative reduction in circulating mature T lymphocytes (both helper T and suppressor T cells) so that plasma is enriched with immature and functionally defective cells. As a result, there is a reduction in the efficacy of all host defenses that depend on T-cell function. Serum antibody levels are usually normal or elevated in the presence of malnutrition. This may be due in part to the numerous infections and high antigenic loads faced by malnourished individuals in impoverished areas, and at the same time, a defect in suppressor T-cell function, which normally inhibits antibody production. (Nelson et al. 2007: 384) To help the lay person, we might note that lymphocytes are a group of white blood cells that, working alone or in combination with others, fight foreign agents, preserving, in the process, our ability to fight infections and other intrusive microorganisms. However, for the immune system to work properly as a defense wall, the lymphocytes must be in optimal functioning condition. This may be the problem in Africa. In East and Southern Africa, some 25 million or 40% of children under five are victims of stunting or irreversible low weight for their age, or have chronic malnutrition. Furthermore, while 18% of the under-fives are underweight, that is, too small for their age, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 7-42% of the children live with acute malnutrition, or wasting, defined as a quick weight loss due to illness and from not having enough to eat. While stunting is \"a measure of protein-energy malnutrition, indicated by low weight for age or failure to achieve expected stature,\" wasting is a \"measure of protein-energy malnutrition that occurs when a child's weight for height falls significantly below what is expected in the reference population\" (Last 2000: 28) .",

            "text": "In Africa, malnutrition often begins with the poor nutritional conditions of pregnant women, affecting negatively the yet unborn child. One form of malnutrition is manifested in the disease that is called pellagra. Pellagra is an Italian word that means rough skin, which can still be found in South Africa, even though few cases of it exist in the rest of the continent today. It used to be common in refugee camps, as was the case in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, DRC, and Angola during the 1980s and 1990s. Pellagra is caused by deficiency in the niacin B-Vitamin complex group, which, biologically, is \"a generic descriptor for pyridine 3-carbonylic acid and derivatives which exhibit qualitatively the biological activity of nicotinamide\" (Prinzo 2000: 10) . Too much reliance on rice, corn, pork meat, and molasses is known to be a major culprit. In its worse stages, pellagra can result in diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death. The disease is almost extinct but it was a major problem in Africa during the 1930s, when it was discovered. The first doctors to treat the disease, which can deform one's skin, described it as early as 1937, when they wrote that it was: \u2026An endemic disease which has been described in certain African tribes both on the East and West coast and also in Central Africa. It is characterized by an acute course progressing usually towards a fatal termination in the second and third month. It displays itself by edema [swelling] which is often severe, a rash which in some respects is unlike the classical description of that in pellagrous adults, diarrhea, dysentery, and perhaps fatty stools. Only a few cases develop obvious neurological signs. Differing thus from the more common but slow and remittent type of the disease as seen in adults no clinical observer who has recorded cases in Africa has been able to agree that it is pellagra. It is known variously as in Africa as 'Gillan's edema,' 'Williams disease,' and malnutrition edema, and is believed to be a new clinical entity. (Trowell 1937: 70) As Zita W. Prinzo remarks, lack of food security, monitoring, and assessment explains the fact that Africans were always caught by surprise and were never able to prevent pellagra in the population.",

Kwashiorkor is a severe condition of malnutrition, a word that was introduced in the medical lexicon during the 1930s by a Caribbean (Jamaican) pediatrician by the name of Cecily Williams. This disease, which some confuse for pellagra, is also a result of lack of protein from such foods as meat, cheese, eggs, fish, nuts, seeds, beans, soy, and specific grains, including quinoa, as well as milk. Just like pellagra, kwashiorkor, in Africa, we are told by nutritionists and biologists, is often associated with war, frequent famines, and natural disasters, such as floods and drought. Its symptoms are fatigue, diarrhea, edema (swelling), damaged immune system, protruding large belly, enlarged liver, flaky rash, shock, change in skin color and hair, muscle mass loss, irritability, and physical inability to grow.",

These have been some of the most important causes of death, which, ultimately, are a result of egregious inequalities and the absolute poverty of more than two-thirds of the continent's population, who live on under $1.50-$1.00 a day, and the mismanagement of the natural resources for which the African continent is known. Many health ministries, public health practitioners, African leaders, and communities have heeded the growing and acknowledged need for proper nutrition of children, women, HIV/AIDS orphans, widows, and senior citizens. In summary, Africa's malnutrition rates must be fought from all angles and sectors, including food security, agricultural production, and child and maternal health. Poverty is a major cause of hunger and malnutrition, but hunger is as well one of the causes of poverty stemming from the inequities in the distribution of economic resources, income, political leaders' \"malfeasance,\" and intermittent conflicts such as wars, and climatic fluctuations in the form of flooding, drought, and volcanoes, which may require abandonment of centuries-old farming and herding lifestyles and the introduction of crop diversification. However, needed changes in lifestyle and livelihood are often hindered by cultural traditions and habits.",

Egregious examples of wars that have displaced millions of people include the Mozambican and Angolan civil wars, the \"fratricide\" wars in Liberia, the unending political bloodletting in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the wars between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Somalia state formation debacle, the Sudanese civil war, and the attempted genocide in Rwanda. In such situations, the people most vulnerable to malnutrition and undernutrition have always been children under the age of five, unaccompanied others, chronically ill people, including those co-infected with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, all pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, individuals from households without an adult male, orphans, and certain underserved or discriminated against ethnic or religious minorities (Levy and Sidel 2008) . Malnutrition is aggravated by such infectious diseases as measles, diarrhea, and dysentery, which lead to loss of appetite and risk of malnutrition or undernutrition, and increase the metabolic rate exponentially. Invariably, such situations contribute to acute malnutrition and lack of vital micronutrients such as vitamin A and tend to exacerbate other physical and nutritional deficiencies. It is easy now to measure nutritional levels through BMI or body mass index. However, according to Levy and Sidel (2008: 219) , at time of emergencies, as happens in Africa, nutritional levels are usually measured through weight-to-weight, because \"weight is more sensitive than height to sudden changes in food availability.\"",

In such cases, Levy and Sidel recommend several strategies that will alleviate the potential for malnutrition and undernutrition, which include: 1. A health information system, e.g., through surveillance of mortality and nutritional status 2. Diarrheal disease control, e.g., through oral rehydration therapy (ORT), community hygiene education 3. Immunization, e.g., of measles for children between ages six and 12 months 4. Basic curative care focusing on maternal and child health, a referral system, and provision of community health workers 5. Selective feeding programs, such as supplementary feeding for those individuals at risk 6. Endemic disease control and epidemic preparedness, which must include surveillance, research protocols, prevention policies, identification of sources of needed vaccines, and partnerships and collaboration with epidemiologists.",

The long-range consequences are that Africa was not able to cut by half the number of undernourished people by the end of 2015. Yet, the realization of the nutritional deficiencies does not seem to ring a bell among many African leaders who do not believe that, by addressing the nutritional needs of these vulnerable populations, they would also raise the living standards of the nation as a whole, increase life expectancy at birth, and enable the containment or control of the high DALYs that stifle and choke economic growth and health quality. Recall that historian Geoffrey Rose argued with the founding fathers of epidemiology that adequate and healthy nutrition would prolong the population's life expectancy and surpass the need for vaccines and many of the interventions we design to fight disease. Healthy nutrition requires awareness, financial commitment from the state and its leaders, adequate infrastructure, sanitation, and hygiene, and safe food. The absence of these basic health needs kills thousands of children in Africa daily, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

Prior to colonialism, people definitely understood how in general nutrition worked to save a child or a sick person, and most people survived from knowledge and experience of traditional practice and remedies. Consequently, they would adjust to the environment. Furthermore, soil contamination, chemicals that interfere with the growth of quality foods, unavailability of land to cultivate vital crops, the introduction of new diseases, and the rapidly disappearing animal kingdom, deforestation, desertification, and drought continue and will continue to prevent Africans' ability to be reasonably well-nourished. In most of the continent, the combination of malnutrition, defined here, as the lack of adequate quality food, and undernutrition, which may be described as lack of enough food intake, even if its quality is adequate, have disturbed the human development process, which was aggravated by frequent periods of hunger and famine during the colonial period in particular.",

Such type of leadership is only in its infancy in Africa. It must be stressed, like the other disciplines of public health, nutrition also requires advocacy, strong and clear policy, and studies involving interdisciplinary collaboration (Spark 2007 : 1-7) .

It is clear now that nutrition means the absorption or consumption of foods, including liquids, that provide the right amount of calories and energy and allows us to live. Conventionally, this word is used in a positive sense, implying the set of foods and liquids that are good, therefore, of quality, for the body. Malnutrition may refer to sufficient but not quality food intake, that is, consumption of deficient foods. Undernourishment or undernutrition means insufficient intake of good or bad foods undermining physical development and thus survival in good health. In many circles in Africa, the distinction among the three words remains blurred, and most leaders equate nutrition to the amount of food available to a certain individual or a segment of the population, and thus concentrate on filling individuals' stomachs, disregarding the simultaneous importance of quality and amount of the intake.",

The WHO and the MDGs Target 5.A. and Target 5.B. goals or universal access to reproductive health wished to see the reduction of maternal mortality in the world by three quarters between 2011 and 2015. Even though the results in Africa have been on the positive side compared to other continents, they are almost negligible. Worldwide, in 2013, some 289,000 women died due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth, even though this represented a decline of 45% over 1990. Whereas in Asia and North Africa, the maternal mortality rate has been reduced by half, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the death rate was 1 per 38 live births, contrasted to 1 in 3700 live births in the developed areas of the globe. Most of the deaths are attributed to lack of access to routine and emergency (Lancet 2014: 5) .",

In the process, training the workforce, including academic and health professionals, is a necessary lifelong activity as the need for healthy behaviors will always be with us as human beings, given that we are constantly interacting with one another domestically and globally. Just like public health in general, behavioral promotion and education targets all determinants of health with the aim of reducing or eliminating inequalities or disparities that influence healthy or unhealthy behavior, such as the impact of fast food restaurants and businesses that pollute the air and contaminate our soil. This is the reason why, at times, behavioral health as a discipline is closely associated with environmental health, as reflected in its designation as \"Behavioral and Environmental Health\" that one sees in textbooks and government health instructions.",

In the developing world, where there is a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, behavioral health education and promotion is even more pressing. For Africa, the nature of this discipline, the application of its principles, and the body of knowledge it can provide to the community are all a part of the critical ingredients of the field of public health. Unfortunately, quite often, the relevant information is available to people but not the skills or will needed for them to modify their behavior. In other words, knowledge and skills rarely go together in Africa, a continent that is viewed globally as having one of the weakest health systems, programs, and outcomes in this arena. In the words of Dennis Raphael in the Oxford Health Promotion International some time ago (2000), in Africa, \"the major distinguishing features included the incorporation of cultural and spiritual factors, emphasis on the community, and emphasis on health promotion as a set of tools rather than a process.\" The last dimension implies that imparting information and skills is the key strategic option.",

How prevalent is the habit of smoking in public, excessive drinking even in the home, consumption of clearly poor diet, neglect of issues of hygiene and sanitation, and absence of infrastructure designed to protect children and those under five from preventable diseases, from careless habits that increase the risk of infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, the latter continuing to kill millions of people? In fact, health education and promotion assures that many deaths could be prevented in Africa through simple methods such as use of mosquito bed nets, safety and protective gear during rides and hazardous work activities, and the drenching of stagnant water. How many precious lives could be saved by preventing children from unnecessary contact with mosquitoes, fleas, flies, and other disease vectors?",

Indeed, says the Medical and Research Foundation (1997), \"the health behavior movements so popular in other parts of the world have not really taken root in Africa,\" especially in Francophone and Portuguese Africa. Presently, in Africa, despite heroic efforts by individuals, awareness campaigns often do not reach their targeted audience, particularly in rural areas, \"while screening for the risk factors is seldom achieved due to lack of skills and training among health workers\" (Delobelle et al. 2010: 1) . David Houet (2008: 49) at the Centre de Recherche Pour le D\u00e9veloppement de la Promotion de la Sante en Afrique (CREDEPSA) says: \"L'Afrique est le continent qui affiche les indicateurs de sant\u00e9 les plus moins reluisants au monde.\" The author ends up by noting that health promotion, 20 years after its adoption (at the Bamako Initiative in 1987), is little known, particularly in the Francophone areas in general, this notwithstanding the value of health promotion, which includes: \"participation, empowerment, contextualization, multisectoralism, multistrategy, and durability. These elements all search for an efficient resolution, for example, of the problems that are well known on the continent of Africa.\" Ijsselmuiden et al. also note that, even by 2001, There was neither a vision for developing capacity to educate staff to manage health systems and public health, nor plans for educating sufficient personnel to manage and develop health systems in Africa\u2026 Medical and health science faculties, business schools and schools of public administration all tended to ignore such concerns\u2026 With the exception of a Rockefeller Foundation initiative in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, little multidisciplinary, system-oriented training in public health [which includes Behavioral Health Promotion and Education] was available in Africa, and no continent-wide assessment of highlevelpersonnel in public health or academic public health capacity had been undertaken.

Third, long-held cultural practices continue to hinder much progress in the health and other sectors, most of which have direct or indirect impact on the spread and prevention of diseases on the continent. We are also advised that \"health promoters should not look at the role of culture as a barrier but rather embrace the cultural dimension in health and not equate health development to Westernization,\" which seems to be the case in most of Africa. Recall that people will change behaviors if there is an incentive, if the outcome is what they expected, and are self-convinced that they can do it (Govender 2005: 39-420) . Fourth, there are competing forces and agents in Africa, including the governments themselves, which pit one health organization against another, or overlapping activities that are not coordinated to achieve one clearly defined and targeted goal. On this, Health Promotion International observes that, \"In Africa, there exists an undeclared war for supremacy among different practitioners. While there seems consensus that health education practitioners are the protagonists of this 'war,' medical doctors, nurses, and professionals from areas seen as social mobilization, behavioral change, communication and social marketing are jostling for niches in a complex pecking order\" (WHO 2001) . Furthermore, lack of effective data collection methods and analysis for outcomes assessment are at their initial stage and little research is conducted by governments and their scholars on the subject of behavioral change. Even worse, for the past 20 years, autonomous schools and programs of public health that would strengthen the role of education and promotion in Africa have been rare.",

Finally, as a thesis of this volume, there is a vacuum of effective, informed, visionary, and committed leadership. It is important to mention as well that strategies for behavioral change did not reach Africa before implementation of the Bamako Initiative in 1987. Many of the relevant targets and strategies, imported from former mother countries, were, therefore, not based on the real needs of the Africans. Yet, to fill this imbalance, African universities have not created more autonomous public health degree programs apart from just offering courses that are simply appendages to the medical schools. Leaders and policy-makers never contextualized the programs and the initiative.",

As Andrew McNab et al., of the Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, write, cross-disciplinary health promotion is needed at the learning institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa, the effective use of social media, and cell phone messaging to \"deliver health promotion to at-risk teen populations.\" Studies have shown that the role of messages expressed in music, theater, and performances seems to have greater impact in Africa than in other parts of the world. Just the beating of the drums can carry a clear message, for example, of impending war, a meeting of the village or the community-at-large, an important funeral taking place, the presence of a lion or a dangerous animal around a compound, or any activity that people must know and take action against, so can the lyrics of a song, the masquerades, and the speeches or utterances of the performers.",

Patrick Ebewo, citing Paulo Freire, who called this type of education \"functional literacy,\" posits that the role of this participatory education as seen in African folklore and performance is designed to awaken the \"people's critical awareness\u2026thus, the mission of this kind of education is to 'lead forth' and cause to develop the good that is latent in everyone; the goal of this education identifies desirable adaptability and changes in human behavior for the betterment and prosperity of mankind. This is a kind of education [he continues] that is appropriate in a lifelong learning situation\" (Ebewo 2008: 471) . The power of theater and drama was highlighted in an evaluation of a program implemented in Lesotho and Botswana, which showed theater to be \"a powerful tool for community education, one which captured the minds of communities and sensitized them to the spread of HIV/AIDS and the need for prevention and imparted skills for care and support\" (see Gasennelwe and Rantona 2000) . Challenges include \"the need for multi-sectoral collaboration and Ministries leadership, paucity of human resources and stable funding, and the limited research and evaluation of best practices\" (McNab et al. 2013: 246-259) . Others point to the need to invest in distance learning technologies, both educational and technical, to optimize the available human and financial resources. However, nothing effective will impact health promotion and education until the presidents and the remaining kings, relics of the distant past, as well as the ministries of health in Africa realize the need for change and advocacy, appropriating the needed funds, and taking action to implement robust programs and activities that aim at creating people awareness and changing health behaviors. As things stand right now, the vision and human seem to be missing, while the universities and medical schools continue to pay lip service through a few courses here and there so often under the \"community health\" or \"community medicine\" banner. A study conducted on public health programs in Africa published in 2007 showed the following realities: Overall, out of 53 countries at the time, 54.7% offered no postgraduate training in public health. Eleven countries, 20.7%, had one program. Eleven others or 20% had more than one program, almost all located in Anglophone countries of Sub-Saharan and Northern Africa. Very few postgraduate programs in Francophone, Portuguese, and Hispanophone countries existed, the Portuguese showing the worse record, where 91% of the population lived without any public health program whatsoever, followed by (Spanish) Equatorial Guinea at 34%. Of the 854 staff workers in institutions that had a postgraduate program only 493 were full time.",

Thus, studies and programs on public health in Africa are sorely needed, though indications are that things are slowly improving. An innovative idea on health promotion and education being implemented in Africa, currently still in its pilot phase, is the concept of health promotion hospitals (HPHs).

According to Buckbinder and Thompson (2010: 2), \"healthcare administration is the profession that provides leadership and direction to organizations that deliver personal health services and to divisions, departments, units, or services within these organizations,\" whose major aim is achieving the goals of the organization and ensuring that adequate resources are provided to meet the needs.",

On the one hand, the internal domain, which it controls and provides the clear mission and vision, is made up of staff, budget, quality resource, patient needs to be met, doctors' relations, performance, purchasers or procurers of needed technology or those who are known as \"hospital information technology solution architects,\" biotech executives, and the development of new service or care. The external domain, on the other hand, includes issues of licensing or licensure, accreditation of related programs by bodies such as the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH), regulations for the industry and the specific ideal organization, CEOs, stakeholders' views and relations, think tanks, business process managers, competitive rival organizations and groups, Medicaid and Medicare (so specifically called in the United States), and insurance or insurers and managed care organizations (Buckbinder and Thompson 2010: 4) .",

In this context, health care administrators or managers operate from a population-based framework: they measure population status, analyze the issues and determinants of health, and recommend and implement interventions, set priorities, take action, assess and evaluate outcomes, institute measures of accountability, and ensure that resources are appropriate and spent efficiently and effectively, and preserve the quality of care, which is a tall order in poor countries.",

            "text": "The WHO lists six critical functions associated with health care policy and management or administration, and these include: planning, organizing, staffing, controlling, directing, and decision making. Managers and administrators of health care must therefore be people who are highly professionally trained, knowledgeable, and ethical, who know but can also influence policy, as health is intrinsically linked to the politics of each setting, including government, legislatures, law enforcement at all levels, relations governing the various levels of authority in the organization, influence peddling by lobbyists and those who deal with patients, such as companies or organizations that provide emergency services, insurers, advocates, stakeholders, and the like. Health managers, therefore, must be hired using procedures that respect the training, experience, and the ethical conduct of the applicants through merit rather than acquaintance, kin, or family ties-unlike many of the hiring practices in Africa. In policy and management, the organizational structure is usually presented in a pyramidal form (say the experts), clarifying the hierarchy and the various types of responsibility and the chain of command, specifying who is in charge of what and of whom, determining whether one is to work alone or in a team or unit, and the overall structure of the type of care. Within this context, the manager or administrator is expected to work to improve the quality and direction of the organization and hire and retain the appropriate individuals, aspects that are often run over by health systems on the continent, \"shaping health policy,\" and \"succession planning.\" This is the reason, as noted earlier, why health policy and management requires well-trained and experienced individuals, who may acquire further skills through academic training, apprenticeship, observation, and practice in a health care setting licensed to provide the needed conceptual and operating skills. Because health care policy and management is one discipline of public health that recommends, manages, and allocates funds for the health of the population, those in position of responsibility are expected to be impeccable in character and ethical in their private and public behavior. As David Eboh (2013) has written about Africa, \"Healthcare is one of the key public services that require significant investment of public fund. As a result, health care institutions need the skills, knowledge, experience and competence of the people that are primarily trained and qualified in the field of business leadership and corporate strategic management, who can think outside the box about ways to maximize clinical productivity, economic profitability, income sustainability, organizational growth and services expansion/contraction.\" Simply put, health policy and management focuses on the provision of effective, efficient, and equal access of health services to the individual and the population. Finally, we might summarize the major distinctions between clinical sector management and non-clinical sector management, as the James Lind Institute does:",

In the non-clinical sectors, managers work in enrollment of health insurance benefits, health care marketing, and health information, provider networking contracts, pharmacy benefit management, medical devices, health policy and biomedical consulting. (James Lind Institute 2014: 1-2) David Eboh suggests that Africa's health systems should be based on \"... robust strategic management models, interagency collaborations and interprofessional partnerships, and require proactive support, promotion, and management,\" while infusing further resources to make them work, one of the weakest aspects of health care delivery in Africa, even though the resources are not always scarce. The excuse of lack of resources is always used by leaders to justify their shortcomings and the weakness of the system. Since the revision of many primary health care systems in Africa at the Ouagadougou Conference (see Ouagadougou Declaration on Primary Health Care Revitalization), under the auspices of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNAIDS, AFDB, and the World Bank in 2008, African states are at varying stages of strengthening the managerial and policy aspect of public health. Some countries have decided to make the system community-based, while immediately strengthening district systems in capacity building, planning, management, integration of activities, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation. In contrast, while others have decided to use their scarce resources on high impact interventions and develop the tools to accomplish the goals, others have focused, at least in theory, on quality assurance and rapid assessment. In terms of the Health Policy and Management, the conference underscored the need to strengthen capacity in policy analysis for the WHO African Region (World Health Organization 2014a, b, c, d: 1-3) .",

Thus, in academic institutions that prepare future candidates to perform this tasks, students are required to familiarize themselves with the core competencies of management, strategic planning, marketing, human resource management, and motivation strategies, and are taught \"how to evaluate the role of governmental institutions in the policy process; examine policy models; and learn how health policies uniquely differ from country to country, from organization to organization, and from town to country.\" With this critical training, financial matters are taught and discussed, along with the social and legal principles that impact health care delivery (See Accreditation Guidelines, Council on Education for Public Health, Jackson State University 2013: 88). There is no doubt that not every aspect of the health care system is always working in a crisis mode. However, the fact that health care is impacted by almost everything people and the government do, one sector will not run smoothly, if part of it is \"ill.\" Most analysts today will agree with Morfaw's study (2008: 249) which showed that: \"Actually, the African health-care industry is experiencing serious management, organizational, and structural problems. Isolated examples of excellence are not the goal, but system-wide quality,\" which requires the use of a total quality control approach to prune and improve the whole system, a strategy proven effective by the physicist W. Edwards Deming who saved the Japanese economy during the 1980s. The WHO has made it clear that a good system to be called such must have the six building blocks in quality and shape on a scale that benefits efficiently and effectively its citizens, whose application in health care is recommended by Morfaw (2008) .",

One is quite sure that data on sports attendance and scores, tourists' arrivals at airports, and money transfers from abroad that go through the proper channels are documented in Africa, but not the vital issues and data on health. However, the rate of fund disap-pearance, for example, that fuels corruption cannot be accounted for; data needed after an epidemic outbreak; hard information necessary to forecast earthquakes and floods; climatic changes and damage to water supplies; and acceptable and reliable records on maternal and child mortality at the hospitals and other health facilities have not experienced a revolution from the digital age.

These include: lack or resources; inability to understand that data collection is not important to governments alone but also to all institutions, businesses activities, assessment of health conditions, attainment of educational goals and outcomes; absence of a professional code of behavior among the few practicing biostatisticians; the perception that the field is not profitable; Africa's inadequate or dismal infrastructure, including the scarcity of tools that allow easy and fast collection of data in the form of new technology and software; and poor leadership, vision, and commitment to the health of the citizens on the part of both political and academic institutions, such as the university system. In the best scenario, universities in Africa may teach statistics at undergraduate level but they often do not offer Master's or Ph.D. programs in the field, and those who teach or earn a degree in statistics are not trained to apply it to life and health situations (Thabane et al.) . If offered, the programs are usually not connected to public health institutions or medical hospitals (Machekano et al. 2015) for the training of a strong and indispensable workforce.",

The precarious condition in Africa regarding the issue at hand was highlighted by a 2008 study that showed that, out of 53 countries then, 50 provided 826 institutions that offered university or post-secondary education; out of 242 of these that had a website, 97 offered a statistics course or statistics-related programs; and among the latter, namely those with a website, only four universities in four separate countries offered a co-op or internship statistics program-the University of Nairobi (School of Mathematics), the University of Ilorin in Nigeria through the Department of Statistics, the University of Zimbabwe in Harare, and the University of Kwazulu-Natal, Faculty of Science and Agriculture ( Thabane et al. 2008) . What is needed in Africa includes the following: effective and visionary leadership among university presidents, the leaders of the various ministries, and intellectuals; advanced degrees in public health, including biostatistics; infusion of new resources; partnerships with institutions at home and abroad and through biostatistics interregional centers; emphasis on data collection and analysis; long-term plans designed to \"build the capacity and the infrastructure of Sub-Saharan research institutes and universities [(see Network of African Sciences Academy (NASAC) 2009)].",

The UN defines environmental health as the discipline that focuses on \"those aspects of human health, including quality of life, that are determined by physical, chemical, biological, social and psychological factors in the environment\u2026It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing, correcting, controlling and preventing those factors in the environment that can potentially affect adversely the health of present and future generations.\" Environmental health as part of public health should not be confused with environmental science, which goes much deeper scientifically into the issues of the environment, examining the biological, chemical, and molecular structure, and the evolution and transformation processes that may ultimately result in harmful impact on humans, animals, and the ecosystem. Scientists and sociobehavioral experts divide the environment into \"biophysical, or natural, and human, or socioeconomic and political dimensions.\" The biophysical dimension (Nhamo and Inyang 2011: 1) involves climate change, temperature, rainfall, wind and evaporation, air, topography, geology, soil, vegetation or flora, fauna or animals, groundwater or hydrogeology, and surface water or hydrology.

United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP 2013) notes that lack of access to improved water, sanitation, and hygiene is responsible for 10% of the disease burden in Africa, affecting mainly children, 28-30% being a result of contaminated water, which causes diarrhea and air pollution. These risks are responsible for a number of respiratory diseases. It is also estimated that out of the 54 countries in Africa today, only 19 will reach the Millennium Development Goal \"of halving the proportion of people without access to basic water and sanitation\" by 2015 (quoted by Lamere 2013) . The impact of pesticides in Cote d'Ivoire, for example, is said to account for 65% of the illnesses among market gardeners, cotton growers, producers, and consumers. The UN, citing its Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, also notes that climate change in terms of higher temperatures is faster in Africa than worldwide and that the temperatures could rise by as much as 3 to 4 degrees C. on the average during the next 100 years.",

Furthermore, whereas, by 2010, improved drinking water sources had risen 11% since 1990, only 60% of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to safe water. As a whole, only North Africa, mentioned in Volume Two, has already reached the Millennium Development Goal of sanitation, with access coverage reaching 89% in 2008 from 72% in 2004. On air pollution, the Third African Environmental Outlook notes that, while outdoor pollution globally kills 800,000 people annually, mainly in urban areas, Africa accounts for 40,000 of the deaths per year. In fact, indoor pollution caused by smoke from cooking charcoal, heat, and prolonged exposure to second hand cigarette smoke has the highest effect in children, and, in Nigeria, studies have shown that quite often these conditions are responsible for such respiratory diseases as capillary bronchitis or bronchopneumonia and asthma. Frightening is the fact that scientists have estimated that home indoor pollution in Africa is higher than the pollution allowed in environmental pollution in industrialized countries. Thus, while in Angola, for example, according to a UNEP Report, 6.9% of the burden of disease comes from solid fuel use, in Malawi it accounts for 5.2% of the deaths. The continent contributes 70% to the global land leased or purchased for food production crops and bio-fuels, which has \"adverse impacts on local food security and livelihoods\" (UNEP, Third Africa Environmental Outlook 2014: 3).",

Indoor and outdoor air pollution, unhygienic or unsafe food, inadequate waste disposal, absent or unsafe vector control and exposure to chemicals are key environmental health hazards in most African countries 3. Effective reduction of indoor air pollution requires rethinking national electrification programs and accelerating access to improved technologies and alternative sources of cleaner energy 4. Measures such as Community Based Natural Resources Management and Payment for Ecosystem Services should be scaled-up to conserve biodiversity, which provides services such as food and medicinal plants and thus promotes human health 5. Chemicals bring benefits in many sectors, but if improperly handled can result in environmental pollution and serious risks to human health (Recommended policy directions include strengthening the knowledge and evidence base of health risks; accelerating domestication and implementation of the Basel, Stockholm and Bamako Conventions; and including issues relating to e-waste in national legislation) 6. Climate change and variability impact human health because of Africa's underdeveloped capacity to cope with the negative impacts (Policy options include integrating climate-related scientific findings into decision making; building adaptive capacity; and strengthening early warning systems, preparedness and response) 7. Coastal and marine resources contribute to human health and need to be conserved and used sustainably (In addition to scaling up Integrated Coastal Zone Management, there is need for effective surveillance in order to protect the coastal and marine environment from degradation and pollution) 8. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation is vital to human health and therefore requires action to improve infrastructure, reduce pollution of available water sources, and address poor hygiene 9. Assessing the suitability of land-use changes, regulating large-scale land acquisition, and promoting technologies that enhance land productivity and more-efficient water use can promote sustainable land management and boost food and nutrition security 10. Adequate adaptation to domestic and global uncertainties, which affect human health, can benefit from scenario analyses that emphasize the various ways in which environmental management may impact human health well into the future and make it possible to make flexible long-term plans 11. Options to improve weak implementation of existing policies include: adequate data and information systems; stakeholder engagement; institutional mechanisms to ensure alignment and collaboration; capacity development of all stakeholders; and clear implementation roadmaps with realistic targets and funding mechanism Tick-borne diseases, including Rift Valley fever, are as well-sensitive to climate change, the same being suspected of the distribution of meningitis, \"even if the mechanism by which it exerts is poorly understood\" (Omer 2010: 11) . We also know that water-borne disease carriers, such as giardia, amoeba, and cryptosporidium, cause diarrhea and cholera and kill thousands of infants in Africa every year. These are all related to variations in water supply. When the aforementioned diseases are added to malnutrition impacted by agricultural changes and natural catastrophes and, over the past three decades, by HIV/AIDS, Africans are urged to take these factors into heightened consideration when making policies and planning their health budgets.",

In fact, they cling to the ideological propensities and theories that the free market will adjust whatever problems we may encounter, using the \"dismal science\" of economics (as some historians have characterized the pseudo-statistical claims of economists and business professionals). Experience has, in fact, discredited these quack scientists who compel people to try to predict a rosy future for our planet, invoking, in the process, economic falsehoods and religious beliefs that contradict science.

Obviously, some definitions of global health are better than others. The most widespread and most discussed is one submitted by Koplan et al., which was endorsed by the Ottawa, panel, in 2009 . The team defined global health as \"an area of study and practice that places priority on improving health and achieving equity-in health for all people worldwide\" (Koplan, et al. 2009 ), one that encompasses \"transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary-based prevention with individual-level clinical care\" (quoted by Gitta et al. 2011: 2) . Koplan et al.' s definition, as good as it is said to be, has encountered criticism from those who believe that public health is neither different nor indistinguishable from global health because the latter encompasses \"a broader perspective on the determinants of health (including political, social and economic as well as biomedical factors), a health concern for all countries of the world [including those with high and low incomes]; integration of population-based health and individual medicine; and primary emphasis on collective global rather than national good, while recognizing that local context and other acts are intimately linked with the global scale\" (Fried et al. 2010: 2) . The focus of global health should not primarily be to middle and low income nations, as the 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion seems to imply, as it focuses on infectious diseases, maternal and child care and \"the complex array of global forces that influence them\" (Battams 2014) . To confuse the matter further, the Ottawa Charter seems to define \"international\" as referring to the work of departments within government ministries that are responsible or dealing with the work of international organizations such as the WHO.",

Thus, the fact that the public health unit within the Ministry of Health in Mozambique, for example, deals closely with UNAIDS does not make it international. It is important to remember that the WHO is not a nation or an entity made up of various nations merged into one to govern as a nation. It is a loose association of the UN member states and world organizations whose primary purpose is to prevent disease and treat sick people. In the same vein, as the overarching organization, the UN is a loose association of countries and organizations that attempt to prevent war and preserve the world's security-it is not a sovereign state. International should literary mean inter-(between) (sovereign) nations and not between nations and an organization that may have some internationally accepted responsibilities and rules of conduct. The American Dental Association seems to be certainly inaccurate when it notes that \"international/global health is an area that addresses the health of people living in low-and middle-income countries (sometimes known as developing countries), focuses on infectious diseases (such as HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and malaria), but also chronic non-infectious diseases, as well as age-related disorders, illnesses, and conditions.\" Global health should also address \"mental disorders and the health consequences of trauma, violence, war, and displacement\" (Global Health Overview, American Dental Association 2014) (see http://explorehealthcareers.or/en/career/51/Global_Health). Kurkbush considers (global) public health to be the discipline that deals with \"those issues that transcend boundaries and governments and call for actions to influence the global forces that determine the health of people.\" As such, it \"requires new forms of governance at national or international level which seek to include a wide range of actors.\" In this definition, the emphasis on collective action and agency are elements that at times do not appear in some. The point made by Beaglehole and Bonita (2006) is that global health, unlike public health, avails itself of all strategies regardless as to whether they are \"population-based or individual-based, combined with those of all sectors and not simply the health sector.\" Kirkbush's position is that global health transcends the usual approach from developed to developing nations, positing that all are \"equal, interdependent, [and] transcending frontier, policies, and sectors,\" often requiring change from local governance to achieve global governance.",

The secondary characteristics in the definition should contain the following: (1) source of obligation (to help those who do not have the means); (2) multidisciplinary approach (joint work of various disciplines and health professionals); (3) actors (individuals or groups as agents of global health); and (4) reactive/proactive measures and interventions (provision of global health). Yet, this heralded definition has been disliked by certain scholars who believe that insisting on the concept of equity or inequity as part of the definition is unjustified as it interjects ideology or opinion, expressed by one scholar as \"ideological baggage,\" thus making it less attractive to those who try to be less intrusive in the objective discussion and provision of health. To this author and many others, the criticism seems paradoxical and misplaced. Eliminating inequalities (and unjustified disparities) has been one of the most important foci in public health literature endorsed by the UN and all its agencies for decades, including condemning unfair disparities which result in or perpetuate poverty and ill health as the cause or associated cause of many diseases and deaths. It is therefore a legitimate concern in all international pronouncements and strategies. The WHO has agreed on the following with the member nations:",

Where systematic differences in health are judged to be avoidable by reasonable action, they are, quite simply, unfair. It is this that we label health inequity. Putting right these inequities-the huge and remediable differences in health between and within countries-is a matter of social justice. Reducing health inequities is, for this WHO Commission of Social Determinants of Health, an ethical imperative. Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale (author's emphasis). (see Krieger 2011: 291) Furthermore, experience has shown that, where the premise of health and access to (quality) health care as a human right is rejected, the US being a prime example, people at the margin do not have access to quality health, if any at all, creating the false impression among the wealthy that they are isolated from infections and other ailment common to poor people, when actually the ill tend to drag the healthy down and end up costing more to the health system than if they were all treated as equal citizens along with the wealthy. The same argument therefore may be used to justify the goals and well-conceived strategies of global health.",

A similar iteration is provided by Merson et al. when they note that global health is the \"application of the principles of public health to health problems and challenges that transcend national boundaries and to the complex array of global and local forces that affect them\" (Merson et al. 2010) .

One of the reasons why there is such confusion about the understanding of global health is its novelty as it became a catchy word only two decades ago. Gitta and colleagues proved this assertion when they carried out a meta-analysis of the use of the concept recently. They came up with the following interesting results: In 2000, the concept of global health appeared only 110 times in journal articles, having jumped to 1,250 in 2010, to 1714 in 2011, and to 2268 in 2012.

In fact, endorsing the concept of global health, the Harvard Business School (see Porter et al. 2009 ) notes that, since 2001, more than $85 billion have been used to ensure that global health becomes a reality, adding that the funds will continue to be available in the future, as nations have accepted how vital it will be, especially for the developing world in such continents as Africa and Asia. However, these areas of the globe will themselves be asked to contribute to the effort based on the level of their economic resources and overall developmental status. Conceived this way, the global approach promises to solve the many existing shortcomings in global health, including: \"sliced\" delivery or uncoordinated or non-integrated delivery of care, across districts, regions and nations; care delivery based on projects, which ends up making the services either overlap or duplicate, thus depriving those areas that need the most critical assistance; lack of adequate and critical data to allow for accurate measurement of health and health-related outcomes; (notwithstanding the urging of Alma-Ata in 1978), the practice of stressing treatment rather than the less expensive focus on prevention; and the superficial evaluation of quantity and scope of services rather than their quality. The weaknesses noted here must be remedied through careful thought, well-crafted strategies, which the Harvard Business School outlines, namely: (1) devising care delivery \"value chains for medical conditions;\" (2) creating adequate infrastructure that is shared among all health sectors; (3) ensuring that health goals are aligned with the countries' economic and social conditions and resources; (4) delivery that takes into account the \"external context\" or creating programs and services that are potentially global and not simply local in impact; and (5) enlisting support and collaboration of the pharmaceutical industry to ensure fair prices that are affordable to the majority of the global community, mainly the poor, the vulnerable, and the underserved (see Porter et al. 2009 ).",

Robinson et al. (2007) , after noting the novelty of the discipline, say that public health has both the positive and negative transnational aspects of health, such as \"cross-border movement of goods, people, practices, and services (including infections, the marketing of unhealthy products on the Internet or satellite TV, and the illicit trade in tobacco or pharmaceutical products) all fall under the general rubric of global health.\" To this statement they add the crucial point, namely, that these global conditions \u2026require international norms, global surveillance, multi-country responses, and the engagement of many players\u2026Progress has been made in developing a set of international rules to address infectious diseases (for example, through the acceptance of the 2005 version of the International Health Regulations) and also in tackling tobacco use-a core risk factor for chronic diseases. (Robinson et al. 2007: 54) The defining specific factors that make global health necessary are wellknown. Some 1.2 million people globally live in absolute and abject poverty, surviving on less than $1.00 a day, and live in miserable conditions that lack the most basic necessities of life, namely, food, shelter, clean water, and sanitation, with 85% of them found in low-and middle-income countries. These also suffer from 12% of the global disease burden, including infectious diseases and malnutrition. Unfortunately, for Africa, 41% of children's deaths worldwide occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, and, of these, 34% take place in South Africa alone. We also know that 11 million children under the age of five die in the middle-and low-income nations annually (Lancet 2009 ). This dire situation is worsened by a high rate of maternal death during child birth: 500,000 women die in developing countries each year due to complications at birth, Africa experiencing the highest rate. A global approach to health delivery and disease prevention can alleviate disease and the death burden, as several studies and health projects have shown.",

The MDGs seem to be realistically attainable using the present and projected future resources in all 189 countries that placed their signatures on the document in 2000. What makes the goals achievement skeptical to some observers is lack of enforcement mechanisms, if countries begin to stall and even go their own way, a problem that can result from individual countries' leadership deficiencies, ignorance, selfishness, misuse of resources, and lack of vision and action to protect the well-being of future generations through robust investment of financial, human, and natural resources. The world community has not had the will and the courage to lay down what consequences there might be for a member state that is delinquent due to its own behavior rather than from unexpected calamities that befall it for no fault of its own. It is clear, for example, that no country in Africa can achieve the three health-related goals without an increased budget allocated to health, notwithstanding the fact that some 10 countries may have raised theirs from 4% to close to 15% as the Abuja Declaration prescribed.

Undoubtedly, these countries endangered the health of the whole world, which, unfortunately, was not itself prepared to deal with a calamity of such magnitude. This was made worse by the fact that states began to quarrel about what quarantining someone meant, when quarantine should be used, and what the criteria were for the globe to apply when similar catastrophes occur-at the time when even citizens and states in the most developed corners of the world began questioning the very idea of quarantining and isolating someone. In the US, the controversy ended up in a court of law, resulting in a victory of the nurse citizen who had worked in West Africa, while the rest of the country, including the supposedly \"infallible,\" know-it-all Centre for Disease Control, led by Director Tom Frieden, and the National Institutes of Health, continued to squabble about what to do.

Meanwhile, the population languishes in a cesspool of poverty, misery, and disease. Short of prosecut-ing at the Hague the perpetrators of health \"crimes\" against the citizens, the global community should find ways of isolating, ignoring, and politically \"quarantining\" leaders and countries that seriously violate human rights, of which health is one, while they endanger the health of the whole planet through neglect, indifference, and selfishness.

            "text": "conclusion Summing up this chapter, the issue of public health's credibility needs to be made clear because it has created a major rift with the so-called \"hard\" science and medicine and among the very experts of this fast evolving field. Paul Starr's criticism of an all-encompassing public health definition is not the only one leveled against the field and its practitioners. The frequent recalls of health products that are prematurely allowed in the community, and the tendency of public health to pose itself as a predicting science, rather than a field that is subject to the whims of individuals and populations' behaviors, and therefore not as solid as a natural science, are major pitfalls that make people distrust what epidemiologists, behaviorists, and nutritionists claim and \"preach\" to be good for people. Indeed, no matter what theories public health practitioners may come up with, they are not always applicable to all individuals and all populations and must always be tailored to specific circumstances, and specific places and times, if possible, and to specific genetic make ups. Public health dilemmas were well expressed by Johnson in 2009 when he wrote that \"achieving public health outcomes for the society involves a contentious process of blending 'science, politics and activism,' resulting in battles fought along both political and behavioral lines\" (quote by Fayoyin 2014: 188).",

            "text": "Understandably, prevention versus treatment has been an issue of controversy among public health practitioners and academicians but more so among the latter. However, both are important concepts and goals and critical to the health of populations. Often, treatment or direct service has been viewed as a more critical task than preventive medicine or preventive health care, perhaps because it is more related to individuals and doctors who often receive more attention than populations. Prevention or preventive health care is antecedent to or the anticipatory step against disease occurrence or ill health if certain measures are not taken or behaviors are not dealt with seriously, and is often seen to be on a higher scale of impact as it aims to preserve the health of populations through what some colonialists in Africa termed \"social prophylaxis.\" In the colonial battles against smallpox, jiggers, yaws, and sleeping sickness on the African continent, there was little distinction between the two, as colonial administrators and their physicians often \"treated to prevent\" or \"tested and treated,\" without much considering the benefits of prevention. The ambiguity is carefully examined by Guillaume Lachenal, who calls it the \"treat-andtreat strategies\" or the \"test-and-treat paradigm\" in colonial Africa. Says Lachenal (2013: 84) , \"From quinine to pentamidine, a constant ambiguity prevailed between individual prophylaxis and collective prevention through \"test-and-treat\" strategies,\" when these were actually based \"on fragile theories, hubristic hopes, na\u00efve faith in wonder drugs, and racial, and colonial paternalism, all of which will sound familiar to many global health practitioners who are aware of public health history.\" Indeed, treating may lead to prevention, as is the case with the HIV/AIDS where the most recent therapies do not only make the sick better but they also stop the easy transmission of the virus to others.",

Indeed, after each treatment, there is often the need for secondary and even tertiary prevention. In other words, this is often the case where the two go hand-in-hand. One thing is clear, though: When preventive steps are not taken, like cigarette smoking cessation, the disease outcome stage is costlier than when the smoker changes his behavior, which often results in no cancer or in a prolonged life span. However, an individual with genetic pre-disposition, at least for most major non-communicable diseases, may not benefit as much from preventive measures, at least at this stage of our public health and medical scientific advances. Unfortunately, even in developed countries, and more so, of course, in the developing nations, budgets for prevention are minimal-they hover around 4-5% while the remainder goes to salaries, equipment procurement, maintenance of health facilities, and treatment. Studies by Weinstein Station conducted in 1976 and 1978 intimated that preventive measures that attempt to reduce the need for treatment against a heart attack, for example, through reduction of early death, may be, in the long run, more costly than the treatment itself, mainly as a result of drug costs. The same seems to be true of the efforts to prevent diabetes by decreasing high cholesterol: The cost is higher than the resulting heart disease treatment (see Okorafor 2010) . This suggests that other factors than simple preventive care should be considered along those that might result in greater positive health outcomes.",

Thus, Physicians for Human Rights Tools and Resources (2010) were enraged when, in 2001, the highest ranking aid official in the Bush Administration, Andrew Natsios, advised, regarding AIDS, that Africa should only be given funding for prevention \"as treatment regimes were too complex for Africans who 'have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives.'\" Such a policy stand is certainly a perversion of the emphasis on preventive care. Denying critical treatment to poor populations due to cost seems to be immoral, as \"no one suggested [prevention] as the only response to AIDS in wealthy countries.\" Natsios showed his insensitivity and the ugly side of false public health by insinuating that prevention can only be done through Western-centered intervention modalities and knowledge of Western preventive practices, forgetting that there are other means of combating or treating disease that are not an exact replica of Western practices (Human Rights Tools and Resources 2010).",

The world must take the issue of global health seriously and agree on how to improve the health of all people on the planet. Currently, says the ECOSOC Forum, three burdensome universal factors will affect everyone and every health system: an aging population throughout the planet, \"rapid and unplanned urbanization,\" and the \"globalization of unhealthy environments and behaviors\" (ECOSOC 2009: 18) . Concluding his analysis of global health and the resources that have been made available so far, Yach, like this author, sees a continued bright future of cooperation between governments, foundations, and NGOs in Africa. However, this partnership with and assistance from major economic conglomerates should be transparent, unbureaucratic, and accountable. Yach cautions that:",

Unfortunately, at present, despite all financial assistance provided by the major external donors and funders, ECOSOC maintains that the gaps are still too many to make global health a reality, especially in health care systems (ECOSOC 2009: 22) . For African institutions of higher learning, global health is considered by many to be another branch of public health. Despite its great appeal at our African institutions today, global health has its own potential negative side for Africa. Institutions with a global health program sometimes have avoided working directly with their African counterparts through African structures or bureaucracy and have tended to use \"[Western] American certified laboratories\" rather than those of the developing countries. Furthermore, by making itself different from public health, it appears that global health is moving toward providing resources to a smaller group of people and relegating supplies and treatment to private institutions. In the end, global health science carries with it a new set of inequalities, which in every case have favored the West and its institutional allies. As Crane puts it:",

We might conclude this discussion by echoing the words of Spielberg and Adams (2011: 5-6), when they wrote: \"The primary aims of global health are to improve population health, reduce the existing disparities in the health between population groups, and protect populations from health threats\u2026A characteristic of global health is that its activities are best carried out in ways that are collaborative and cooperative, and involve multiple interested partners, often from a variety of disciplines\" (see also Farmer 2004) .",
