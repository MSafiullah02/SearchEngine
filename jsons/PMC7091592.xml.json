            "text": "Since 1989, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), after stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been increasingly used as an alternative to hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow in related donor transplants.1 In the following years allogeneic PBSCT began to displace BMT, and in 1996 the EBMT published data on more than 1000 transplants.2 The potential advantages of PBSC for allogeneic transplants are several. Firstly, rapid engraftment could be demonstrated in patients with PBSC transplants in comparison to those with BMT.34 This might reasonably be expected to reduce infection and bleeding risk. Thus, published reports have indicated that PBSCT is associated with a reduced need for antibiotics, shortened hospital stays and lower 200-day mortality.5 Moreover, reports have also suggested that immunological recovery is more rapid following allogeneic PBSC transplants.6 Typical PBSC products contain three to four times more CD34+ cells and up to 20 times higher T cell levels than do typical marrow products.7 Therefore, the main concern with allogeneic PBSC transplantation is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Reports to date, however, have not identified an increased incidence or severity of acute GVHD following PBSCT.8 On the other hand, increased incidence and severity of chronic GVHD have been reported by some groups.910 The results of the first randomized trial comparing allogeneic PBSCT and BMT presented at the ASH meeting in 1999 confirmed no difference in incidence of aGVHD and a tendency to higher incidence of chronic GVHD in patients transplanted with mobilized peripheral stem cells.11 It should be noted that this trial showed a higher mortality rate in patients transplanted with bone marrow stem cells and a significantly higher overall survival for PBSCT patients. This important message should be confirmed in other randomized trials. For instance, other authors12 presented the results of a randomized trial comparing allogeneic BMT and PBSCT from related donors. The incidence of GVHD was equivalent in the two groups (48% vs 57%), the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was significantly higher in the PBSCT group (77%) than in the BMT group (27%) and no difference of overall survival could be demonstrated (at 1 year 67% and 59%, respectively). The higher number of T cells may also induce a more potent GVL effect. PBSCT may be advantageous for allogeneic donors.1314 Only 3\u20137% of donors experienced complications15 from stimulation by G-CSF but no general anesthesia was necessary. The procedure is carried out in an outpatient setting. Nevertheless, one concern has been the ethics of using unrelated donors to mobilize PBSC, although the side-effects after administration of G-CSF to normal donors are tolerable after several years of follow-up. Thus, in the last 2 years only a few patients who received PBSCT from unrelated donors have been reported. We started unrelated allogeneic PBSC transplants in 1995 and 37 patients have been transplanted in our department. We report our experience with allogeneic PBSCT in comparison to BMT in a matched pair analysis. In addition, we analyze the incidence of acute GVHD in all patients as well as HLA-identical transplant patients.",

Bacteremia occurred in 15 patients including seven in the BMT group and eight in the PBSCT group. Out of the total number of 74 patients, eight (11%) suffered from Gram-positive coccal infections (three in the BMT group and five in the PBSCT group). In a comparatively high number of patients (three in the PBSC group and four in the BM group) Gram-negative bacteria were identified in blood cultures: four cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and three of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. No one died from septicemia. Only one patient (in the PBSCT group) developed bacterial pneumonia that was followed by a therapy refractory ARDS. CMV-PCR was positive in 24 patients, namely, 13 in the PBSC group and 11 in the BM group. The number of patients with CMV reactivation (PCR positivity) was low due to suitable pre-emptive treatment and prophylaxis strategy: gancyclovir (5 mg/kg i.v.) 5 days a week was started in all high risk patients for CMV infection after engraftment. Only one patient developed a CMV infection and died from interstitial pneumonia (in the BMT group). One patient after BMT and acute GVHD, grade IV, that was successfully treated by combined immunosuppressive therapy died from herpes simplex pneumonia refractory to acyclovir. Five patients (all in the PBSCT group) suffered from hemorrhagic cystitis not earlier than day 40. BK virus was detected in all cases. Invasive fungal infection was diagnosed in five patients, three in the BMT and two in the PBSCT group. All these patients had a pretransplant history of pulmonary aspergillosis. Three patients died from progressive fungal pneumonia, refractory to liposomal (one patient) or conventional (two patients) amphotericin B. Two patients \u2013 one from each group \u2013 are alive and without any signs of pneumonia after treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. Other types of fungi were not detected. One patient in the PBSCT group, who was anti-toxoplasma IgM positive before the transplant, developed cerebral toxoplasmosis (pathological finding in section) with clinical signs of encephalitis. Excluding the hemorrhagic cystitis, because the reason for its occurrence is still not clearly determined (the role of BK virus in the pathogenesis is under investigation), the overall number of infectious complications in the two groups did not differ (12 patients in each group, Figure 3).",

            "text": "This study is one of the first to prospectively establish that PBSCT from unrelated donors is feasible and leads to a faster leukocyte recovery in comparison to BMT. Thirty-seven patients received PBSCT from unrelated donors from 1996 up to May 1999 and 37 patients received BMT. Ringden et al23 also reported a significantly faster neutrophil engraftment in the PBSCT group. It should be noted that the patients in BMT group were not treated with G-CSF post-transplantation, which may influence the difference in neutrophil recovery between BMT and PBSCT. The use of G-CSF after transplantation is not the practice in our center because of the effect on residual leukemia which could not be excluded.5 However, the incidence of infections was not different in the two study groups, probably as a consequence of the small number of patients with documented infections in both groups. Nevertheless, the overall number of documented infectious complications and death from severe infections was lower in the PBSCT group. Time to platelet engraftment did not differ in the two groups, which contrasted with the experience of other studies in related settings.23 Recently, Blaise et al24 reported in a randomized trial that PBSCT resulted in quicker neutrophil and platelet recovery than does BMT from sibling donors. However, a higher occurrence of chronic GVHD was observed. The main finding in this study is the significantly higher incidence and shorter time of onset of severe acute GVHD in patients who received PBSCT. The rate of acute GVHD observed after allogeneic PBSCT from HLA-identical siblings has been reported to be similar to BMT.25 In a recently published multicenter analysis26 we demonstrated a trend to a higher incidence of severe acute GVHD in the PBSC group compared to the BM group (30% vs 20%). The results in our recent analysis of transplants from unrelated HLA-identical donors26 corresponds with the published data,27 especially with the results of prospective, randomized trials in transplants from related donors presented at the meeting of ASH last year.1112 Including the data from transplants of HLA-non-identical unrelated donors might introduce differences due to matching mistakes. The number of patients with donors who were not HLA identical was 10 in the PBSCT group and seven in the BM group. Another reason for the higher incidence of acute GVHD might be the number of high risk patients. In the PBSCT group it was somewhat higher in comparison to the BMT group (20 vs 14). In addition, the CMV positivity of patients prior to transplantation was known to be a risk factor for acute GVHD. CMV positivity was not matched, so there were significant differences between the two groups (the number of negative patients was 14 in the PBSCT and 23 in the BMT group, respectively). It should also be noted that the CD34+ as well as CD3+ cell differential is significantly higher in PBSC grafts in comparison to BM grafts, and may partly explain the higher incidence of acute GVHD in PBSCT group. The impact of G-CSF on T cell functions as well as on alloreactivity for both GVH and GVL effects is still unclear and needs further investigation.2829 The incidence of chronic GVHD in the PBSCT and BMT groups was not different (58% and 42%, respectively). With regard to overall survival, relapse and relapse-free survival, there was no difference between outcome in patients receiving PBSCT compared with the BMT group. However, it should be noted that the end survival and DFS in the BMT group showed a trend to be better probably due to the slightly worse TRM in the BMT group. This is in agreement with the experience in the HLA-identical siblings as well as in the unrelated setting.232627 The follow-up of our patients was short and the data need to be re-evaluated with time. We conclude that PBSCT from unrelated donors is a safe procedure and results in faster neutrophil engraftment than BMT. The eventual disadvantages for the donors need several years follow-up in order to answer different questions raised with regard to the treatment with G-CSF. However, according to the data published to date,3031 it appears that G-CSF treatment and PBSC collection have an acceptable short- and long-term safety profile in normal donors. Thus, for donors the benefits are obvious, but for recipients the benefits are less so. The incidence of acute GVHD in HLA-identical PBSC transplants was not higher than in BM transplant patients. Finally, the results of this study provide evidence that PBSCT from unrelated HLA-compatible donors can be safely administered as an alternative to BMT. However, the use of PBSCT from HLA-mismatched donors needs further investigation and follow-up with regard to acute and chronic GVHD. On the other hand, the important antileukemic effect of chronic GVHD should not be neglected. We propose to use PBSC as a source for unrelated donors providing that these donors are HLA identical, identified by using serological for class I and genomic for class II HLA typing. With regard to PBSC from HLA-mismatched donors further investigations and follow-up are needed in order to answer the question on the incidence of acute as well as chronic GVHD. In conclusion, we believe that PBSCT by using HLA-mismatched unrelated donor is feasible and safe in a carefully selected patient population.",
