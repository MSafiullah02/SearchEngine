Because exploiting new ideas is often harder than more conventional science, novel work can be especially dependent on interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators. Location may thus influence the tendency to pursue work that is close to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent ideas. We calculate for each nation its position relative to the edge of the scientific frontier by measuring its propensity to build on relatively new ideas in biomedical research. Text analysis of 20+ million publications shows that the United States and South Korea have the highest tendencies for novel science. China has become a leader in favoring newer ideas when working with basic science ideas and research tools, but is still slow to adopt new clinical ideas. Many locations remain far behind the leaders in terms of their tendency to work with novel ideas, indicating that the world is far from flat in this regard.",

The ideas only gradually mature into useful advances after a community of scientists tries them out and develops them. But such work is hard, harder than work that builds on well-established ideas. Thus, when a scientist seeks to build on a recent advance, it is beneficial to be surrounded by a community of scholars with whom to debate about which new ideas to try out and how (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Daily interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators are therefore especially important in scientific work that is closer to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent advances. Because such local factors influence the fertility of the debates that seek to unlock the mysteries of new ideas, the tendency to work with new ideas can be expected to vary by location. This mechanism -and thus the import of location -may even be increasingly influential. For increases in training times, specialization, and teamwork indicate that reaching the edge of the frontier now involves even more work than before (10). Therefore, even as the pursuit of science spreads to more diverse places, location may well continue to have an important influence on what kind of science is pursued -through the impact that location may have on the ability to work with novel ideas. Identifying where barriers to knowledge adoption still exist is thus crucial for understanding the role of location in knowledge production and for designing policies that can help eliminate the remaining barriers.",

The results reveal each nation's position on the scientific frontier: what share of its contributions to biomedical science build on relatively new ideas vs. well-established ideas. We refer to the constructed measure as the edge factor. Whereas the familiar impact factor measures scientific influence (11, 12) , the edge factor measures an aspect of novelty of scientific work -the tendency to build on ideas close to the edge of the scientific frontier. These measures capture distinct aspects of science and are complementary tools in policy evaluation and design (13).

We use text analysis to determine the ideas that each paper built upon and also the vintage of those ideas (see Methods and Materials) . Location of each contribution is assigned based on the affiliation of the first author of the paper. We select countries as the unit of analysis because borders continue to influence scientist interactions and because many important science policy decisions are set at the national level. The results show that the United States and South Korea have the most advanced positions on the scientific frontier: scientists working in these nations build on cutting-edge ideas more often than do scientists in other locations. The propensity for novel science is well above average also in Singapore and Taiwan. Countries that come after these four countries have approximately average propensity for novel science. Such countries include China, Canada, most western European countries (including the United Kingdom and Germany), Australia, and South Africa. Other countries (including Turkey, India, Brazil, and Iran) come further behindscientists in these countries have clearly below average propensities for novel work. Confidence intervals and results for alternative specifications (shown in Table S4 ) indicate that in most cases these results are robust (the one exception is Saudi Arabia, for which results from alternative specifications suggest a below average tendency for novel work). Countries examined here thus have quite different propensities for work with newer ideas in biomedicine.

One important exception is China. China's contributions linked to the idea category grouping \"Basic Science and Research Tools\" now have the second highest propensity for novel work (after Singapore), but its contributions linked to idea category groupings \"Clinical and Anatomy\" and \"Drugs and Chemicals\" are well below average in terms of their novelty.

Cross-national differences in new idea adoption and China's remarkably ability to leapfrog in this regard may also be driven in part by differences in incentives to pursue novel work: it has long been understood that nations without vested interests in existing technologies have an elevated incentive to explore new ideas (18, 19) .

Their analysis was motivated by the idea that a nation's capabilities determine the input varieties that can be fruitfully used in production. Our work, by contrast, is motivated by the idea that capabilities determine whether a nation's scientists can take advantage of the opportunities created by the arrival of new ideas. Moreover, whereas in this related work the complexity of goods production is measured indirectly based on exports, the edge factor is calculated directly based on the measured idea inputs. Common to these analyses is the belief that the capabilities of a nation affect which inputs it uses and both analyses are aimed at constructing new measures that reflect those capabilities.",

The ability to take advantage of scientific opportunities continues to vary across locations in spite of the \"death of distance\" phenomenon, because locational differences in capabilities persist (21-24). But some aspects of our results also differ from the results obtained through traditional analyses of scientific productivity. Data on the tendency to produce highly cited papers point to the United States as a leader that remains far ahead of most western European nations and even further ahead of South Korea, Taiwan and China (1, 2, (25) (26) (27) . Our analysis on the use of new ideas, by contrast, suggests that South Korea, Taiwan and China have caught up with western Europe and are now close to the United States in terms of their tendency to work with cutting-edge ideas.",

Moreover, useful work that tries out a new idea need not be influential in the traditional sense; such work can have scientific value -in terms of helping unlock the mysteries of the new idea -even when it merely demonstrates which research paths do not work. 17. Of course, not all fruitful interactions are limited by location, as is evidenced by the fact that a quarter of science now involves international collaborations (1, 2) . However, the rise of long-distance collaborations can also be a source of cross-national differences in new idea 28.

The comparison is also limited by research area because whether the use of an idea represents novel work is expected to depend on the context where it is used.

In robustness analyses, we construct the indicator variable using alternative choices for the cutoff percentile (top 1%, top 5%, or top 20%) Figure S4 shows Contributions with a cohort between these extremes are sometimes novel and other times not. This is because novelty is calculated by comparing the vintage of a contribution to the vintage of other contributions linked to the same (idea category, research area) pair. Hence, the cutoff cohort for novel contributions varies across (idea category, research area) pairs. Table S3 shows examples of ideas, as represented by UMLS terms, captured by our approach. The table also shows the idea category of each term. Some terms appear multiple times because these terms are linked to multiple UMLS categories by the UMLS metathesaurus.

That is, here the novelty score for an entity is calculated first at the contribution-level separately for each (idea category, research area) pair and the overall novelty score for the entity is then calculated as a weighted sum across these each (idea category, research area) pairs. By contrast, in the prior work (15) the novelty score for an entity was calculated at the paper-level either without controlling for either the idea category or the research area, or by only controlling for the research in a manner that essentially uses as weights the entity's own involvement in the research area (in this prior work the research area was determined based on the appearance of 6-digit MeSH terms; the entity of interest in this prior work was a journal, here it is a nation).",

The focus on the use of new ideas makes it possible to include on a larger number of ideas in the analysis than is computationally feasible in an analysis of combinatorial novelty. Analysis of the use of new ideas is also important because the trying out of new ideas is so central to scientific progress.

A possible explanation is that countries may differ in terms of how many of their institutions are on the very edge of the frontier (\"the bleeding edge\"), so that some countries to fare better when novelty is calculated based on a narrower measure. For example, the U.S. may have many of the very top institutions in the world (in terms of their tendency to work with new ideas) but most of its institutions may be further down in the pack. In another country, such as China, institutions may be more homogenous in terms of the scientists' tendency to work with new ideas. The differences may also be driven by variation in where the new ideas are first born (the United States may be disproportionately the origin of new ideasand thus receive a disproportionate share of the very first mentions of new terms -but scientists working in China may be relatively more eager to build on the new ideas).",
