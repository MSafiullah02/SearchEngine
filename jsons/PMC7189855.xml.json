Laboratory tests revealed a normal white blood cells and platelet count (WBC 6470/mm, PLT 290.000/mmc), normal liver and kidney function and an increased C-reactive protein (49.4 mg/L). Blood cultures were negative. Bilateral interstitial pneumonia was found on chest x-ray. Naso-pharyngeal swab tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA amplification resulted positive. She was admitted to the Infectious Disease Department and started off-label antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, following Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT) guidelines and empiric antibiotic therapy with third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone). Other drugs administered during hospitalization were: rabeprazole, paracetamol, metoclopramide, dihydrocodeine, lactulose and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. In the subsequent days, she promptly recovered: she never had fever, we have been able to gradually decrease oxygen flow and on the 30th of march, antiviral and antibiotic therapies were discontinued. Over the following days a maculo-papular itchy rash appeared on the trunk resembling a Grover disease (Fig. 1\n).",

When extracting information from the studies, pairs of researchers conferred to compare findings and reach consensus. Where consensus was not reached, an independent researcher was consulted. We also searched for grey literature including advisories from professional societies, expert commentaries, blogposts, magazine articles, newspaper articles and social media posts to retrieve relevant information. The information from grey literature was not included in the results section, however, it has been summarized in the Supplemental File 1.",

The mean patient age was 53.6 years, with patients between 15 days and 84 years of age. Males accounted for 38.9% of reported cases, females accounted for 27.8% of cases, and the sex of 37.5% cases was not reported.

It can be postulated that the viral particles present in the cutaneous blood vessels in patients with COVID19 infection could lead to a lymphocytic vasculitis similar to those observed in thrombophilic arteritis induced by blood immune complexes that activate cytokines. Keratinocytes may be a secondary target after Langerhans cells activation, inducing a spectrum of different clinical manifestation [6,32]. It can be postulated that the virus does not target the keratinocyte, but rather immune response to infection leads to Langerhans cells activation, resulting in a state of vasodilation and spongiosis [32]. Further theories suggest livedo reticularis-resembling manifestations can result due the accumulation of microthromboses originating in other organs, thus reducing blood flow to the cutaneous microvasculature system [8]. Similarly, low grade disseminated intravascular coagulation and hypoxia-related accumulation of deoxygenated blood in venous plexes may further explain such manifestations [8]. Additionally, pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d as well as co-localization of these with COVID-19 spike glycoproteins was reported by Magro et al. [33]. It is still unclear whether cutaneous symptoms are a secondary consequence of respiratory-related infection or a primary infection of the skin itself. It is more likely that a combination of such mechanisms is responsible for the cutaneous manifestations found in COVID-19+ individuals.",

Firstly, the small sample size used in this analysis restricts the ability to draw strong conclusion applicable to whole populations. Additionally, since scientific understanding of COVID-19 and associated dermatological symptoms is currently evolving at this stage, the information contained in this review is based mainly on the limited early experience with COVID-19. Due to limitations in the availability of COVID-19 literature, the recency of the COVID-19 outbreak, and language-related exclusion criteria, this paper only examines 72 cases of COVID-19 related cutaneous pathologies. Lastly, we must take into account the possibility of dermatologic side effects experienced from medications used by participants.",
