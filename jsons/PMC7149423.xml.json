Also, viruses can be transmitted directly by vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks. Indirect contact would include environmentally acquired viral infections (via food, water, air, or fomites) that are not spread by close contact. Infectious viral diseases can be spread through the air either by direct or indirect contact via droplet or particle transmission, respectively.",

Biowarfare is defined as the military use of biological agents, where targets of agents are predominately military personnel, government officials, or resources that might hinder a nation\u2019s ability to attack and/or defend itself. Bioterrorism is defined as the threat or use of biological agents by individuals or groups motivated by political, religious, ecological, or other ideological objective. Viruses of concern from a biowarfare or bioterrorism perspective represent a major theme of this chapter. A biocrime is defined as the threat or use of biological agents for individual objectives such as revenge or financial gain. Use of viruses in biocrimes against people have been documented, with sources limited primarily to clinical samples containing viruses such as HIV-1 and hepatitis A (Carus, 2001). Viruses have also been used to reduce animal populations unlawfully and by definition, such action would be categorized as a biocrime (Carus, 2001).",

Parameters of risk associated with properties or characteristics of viruses would include high infectivity, high morbidity and mortality, environmental stability, airborne transmissibility, and high contagiousness. Parameters associated with vulnerabilities include limited or unavailable medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and therapeutics, with cost and increasing public resistance to vaccination as contributing factors, limited or unavailable means to detect and identify viruses, and the ability of a virus to cause disease that is difficult to treat. Parameters of risk associated with adversary capability and intent include ease of acquisition, production, and dissemination of viral agents; and evidence of prior research and development as a biological weapon (Center for Biosecurity, UPMC, 2008).",

With the exception of smallpox, which some experts speculate is responsible for more deaths throughout modern history than all other infectious diseases combined, the greatest human and economic consequences derived from virus infections via natural exposure have been realized from emerging diseases, all of which have been derived from infected animals via zoonoses. For example, influenza pandemics that occurred in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2) resulted in approximately 40\u201350, 2, and 1 million deaths worldwide, respectively (World Health Organization, 2008). It is thought that the 1918 H1N1 virus was an avian virus that was introduced into pigs, and subsequently transmitted to human carriers, which spread the virus along trade routes and shipping lines resulting in a global pandemic (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006). In the past 25 years, approximately 60 million people have been infected by HIV-1, resulting in greater than 25 million deaths (Avert, 2008). HIV-1 most likely originated in wild chimpanzees living in tropical rain forests of equatorial Africa, with infection of humans likely occurring during the French colonial period from 1919 to 1960 (Keele et al., 2006).",

Traditional agents would include viruses that could be disseminated to cause mass casualties in susceptible populations. Although risk posed by traditional viral agents is significant, a finite number of viruses fit in this category. Of particular concern are variola virus (smallpox) and viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever such as filoviruses (Lake Victoria marburgvirus and ebola viruses), arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia viruses), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses, Rift Valley fever virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), and flaviviruses (yellow fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and dengue viruses) (NIAID, 2008). These viruses can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person-to-person, resulting in high case-fatality rates and have the potential for major public health impact (Peters, 2002); might cause public panic and social disruption; and require special action for public health preparedness (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008; WHO, 2005). Therefore, the development or existence of targeted medical countermeasures against these agents will reduce the current risk posed or the likelihood of mass casualties resulting from intentional use.",

Although remaining stocks at these laboratories were scheduled to be destroyed in 1996, the World Health Assembly subsequently accepted a recommendation to retain the remaining stocks and to review a decision to destroy them on a periodic basis. Should the existing repositories be destroyed, other potential sources of smallpox may exist. Conceivably, sources of the variola virus may include unknown stores, cadavers in permafrost, and recreation of the viral genome or strains in laboratories utilizing genetic engineering, recombination, and data from published genomic sequences as a basis for design (Darling et al., 2005).",

Such viruses would include foot-and-mouth disease, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and other viruses that may employ invertebrate hosts as vectors, from which virus can be subsequently amplified in animal hosts and also can be transmitted to humans.

In summary, licensed vaccines exist for only a few viruses of concern and are of limited supply in case of catastrophic need (Schmaljohn and Hevey, 2005). For other viruses, vaccines are available under investigational new drug (IND) status, which have not been licensed for a variety of reasons, primarily the lack of market incentive to develop through to licensure (Schmaljohn and Hevey, 2005). In light of the paucity of medical countermeasures effective against viruses of concern, subsequent chapters of this text are devoted to review of vaccine development efforts against biodefense, emerging and neglected diseases.",

Such assessment must be performed to define gaps in knowledge or vulnerabilities in our preparedness posture, thus guiding prioritization of investments in biodefense-related research, development, planning, and overall preparedness. Vaccines represent a necessary component of biodefense countermeasure development to prepare for and to minimize the consequences of a biological attack. Risk assessments have provided a means of identifying and prioritizing vaccine research and development efforts for biological agents capable of being used in biological attacks. In support of vaccine research and development, current biodefense strategies include the development of an enduring infrastructure to test and evaluate existing, proposed, or promising countermeasures, assess their safety and effectiveness, expedite their development, and ensure rapid licensure (Gronvall et al., 2007c; NIAID, 2008; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2008).",

Current approaches to biodefense vaccine development include use of existing applications for development and manufacturing, and development of new technologies to rapidly design, test and evaluate, and manufacture desired products. Given the urgency with which vaccines designed to minimize consequences of bioterror events are needed, new technologies and infrastructure are mandated to shorten timelines for their development. New technologies applicable to the design of vaccines would include rapid methods for the identification and selection of protective immunogens, and the development of vaccines that allow for differentiation of vaccinated hosts from those infected by exposure to virus, with options to employ improved adjuvants that stimulate innate immune responses and/or promote adaptive immune responses (Capua, et al., 2004). New infrastructure would include biocontainment facilities to increase current capacities for vaccine testing and evaluation, to optimize vaccine dosage and delivery in conjunction with routes of exposure, and enhance manufacturing capacities to ensure availability of a minimum number of doses for intervention and reduce average cycle times to manufacture vaccine lots. Rapid deployment of biodefense vaccines will require both infrastructures, to include facilities for storage of vaccine stockpiles, and technologies that ensure validated storage conditions for such stockpiles (Gronvall et al., 2007a).",
