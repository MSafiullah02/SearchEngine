This debate is understandable given the paucity of data and need for rapid generation of guidance, but it is a cause of confusion among respiratory physicians.",

In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), early intubation was associated with survival benefit when PaO2/FiO2 ratio was <150 when compared with NIV.3 Some COVID-19 guidelines have therefore suggested NIV as a bridging therapy only, before transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and IMV. However, up to 50% of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU did not subsequently require IMV.4 Given the considerable resource limitations imposed by the current unprecedented viral pandemic, it is important to ascertain whether selected patients can be safely managed outside of the ICU.",

Though the primary outcome of intubation at day 28 was negative, HFNC reduced requirement for intubation in a subgroup of patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200 and was associated with a reduction in mortality when compared with NIV or regular oxygen face mask. The NIV group of this study involved NIV use for an average of only 8 h per day, however, and a relatively high target tidal volume of 7\u201310 mL/kg. FLORALI also utilised a flow rate of 50 L/min with HFNC. To ameliorate potential aerosol generation, a flow limit of 30 L/min in COVID-19 has been proposed. The level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) supplied is consequently reduced. Notably, with regards to aerosol generation and risk to health-care workers, intubation poses a greater risk than NIV and a risk with HFNC has not been established.8\n",

A major benefit of PEEP is that it might allow for down-titration of FiO2, mitigating against over-consumption of hospital oxygen supply and avoiding hyperoxia-related lung injury. Anecdotal reports and our own experience of COVID-19-related lung injury suggests a good response to application of PEEP, perhaps related to recruitment of atelectasis and reduced work of breathing. PEEP of 10 cm H2O or higher can shift the lung to the point on the pressure\u2013volume curve with the highest slope (high compliance).9 Haemodynamic instability appears to be a relatively infrequent feature of these patients, and thus higher PEEP (ie, expiratory positive airway pressure) than traditionally applied with NIV is likely to be tolerated well.",

Regardless of mode, the key factor in improving oxygenation is mean airway pressure (Paw). Addition of pressure support has the advantage of compensating for resistance present in the tubing and in further reducing work of breathing.10 It is prudent to follow ARDSnet guidelines in maintaining tidal volume of \u22646 mL/kg through low pressure support (driving pressure), relatively high PEEP, and the lowest FiO2 feasible. To mitigate against nosocomial aerosol transmission, it is critical that NIV circuits are modified to include a filter at the exhalation port or vent.",

NIV is a well-established therapy with which general respiratory physicians and nurses are familiar, and which is readily applicable in the non-critical care setting.
