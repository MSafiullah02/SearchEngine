The Amaryllidaceae are richly represented in the tropics and have pronounced centers of diversity in South Africa and the Andean region. Some genera are also found in the Mediterranean area and the temperate regions of Asia. The family's phylogenetic relationships closely follow geographic distribution, with much regional endemism, which adds credence to a Gondwana origin for the family at a time when the continents were much closer together (1). The hypothesis that the family evolved in Africa and subsequently spread to other continents, further suggesting that South America is the center of secondary diversification is supported by the matK sequence data (2).",

A few species extend into France and Italy, and even fewer are found in the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. Records outside this area, such as N. tazetta variants in China and Japan, are almost certainly ancient introductions 3., 4.. The native habitats of Narcissus species are very varied, ranging from lowland to mountain sites, including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks, and rocky crevices (3). Most of the species flower in late winter and spring, although a few flower in the autumn (5). All species are insect pollinated, with the majority possessing showy flowers, some of which are highly scented (6). The major pollinators are bees, butterflies, flies, and hawkmoths 5., 7., 8..",

However, although the status bestowed upon the individual groups may vary somewhat from author to author, the basic content of each group is similar in the various classifications 3., 4., 5.. The most recent classification Scheme 4, which incorporates elements of those of Fernandes and Webb 9., 10., 11., also notes that substantial work of revision is needed for some taxa in the genus. The inferred plastid-based phylogeny, on the other hand, reveals that floral morphology has been remarkably dynamic during the history of Narcissus, indicating extensive and repeated diversification and convergent evolution. Polymorphic sexual systems in Narcissus have evolved independently from the ancestral monomorphic state on at least six occasions 5., 12.. As these morphologies are associated with particular suites of pollinators, the recurring transitions from one floral design to another have probably accompanied pollinator transitions. Additionally, the remarkable resemblance of flower features between unrelated species indicates that pollinator activity might have driven flower convergence (13).",

Hybridization has become very popular, resulting in thousands of commercial Narcissus cultivars that are in most cases larger and more robust than their wild parents (3). Moreover, large garden varieties of daffodils have recently been crossed with many of the small wild species to produce delightfully graceful blossoms. Unfortunately, the ability to produce new kinds of miniature daffodils is hampered by the disappearance of many of the tiny wild species (14). Thus, the survival of a number of Narcissus species is under threat because of over-collection and habitat destruction. There is a need to maintain vigilance in the conservation of wild species and of their many variants (15).",

Thus, the genus Behria, in spite of having been classified as Amaryllidaceae (21), does not have any Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (22) and should therefore be included in the Alliaceae family. Furthermore, although it is unusual to find other types of alkaloids in this family, if present, they are always accompanied by typical Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. The classical example is the reported presence of the mesembrane (Sceletium) alkaloids, generally found in the Aizoaceae family 23., 24., in a few species of Amaryllidaceae such as Hymenocallis arenicola, Crinum oliganthum, N. pallidulus, and N. triandrus\n25., 26., 27.. In turn, the unexpected isolation of (\u2212)-capnoidine and (+)-bulbocapnine from Galanthus nivalis subsp. cilicicus is the first report of the occurrence of classical isoquinoline alkaloids in a typical member of the Amaryllidaceae (28). On the contrary, the isolation of the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid crinamine from the wild yam Dioscorea dregeana (Dioscoreaceae) has also proven that Amaryllidaceae alkaloids may well be encountered in other plant families (29). Both of these results suggest that the definition of the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids should be reconsidered, and also the alkaloidal profile of this plant family.",

            "text": "The presence of alkaloids in plants is believed to be a protective adaptation, which in Amaryllidaceae is connected with the seasonal cycle of development, many species grow in early spring when other genera are only just starting to grow (30). Thus, Amaryllidaceae plants present an ontogenic variation of alkaloids, and the effects of stress, such as incisional injuries or insect attacks, on alkaloid metabolism causes almost complete hydrolysis of the alkaloidal conjugates and also produces oxidized metabolites (31). Regarding co-evolutionary adaptation, a notable example is the elaboration of a new conjugate alkaloid (telastasine) by the insect Polytela gloriosa Fab. (Noctuidae), a smokey-gray moth that is adapted to toxic Amaryllidaceae plants 32., 33.. Plants and insects use the same detoxification mechanism. These alkaloids, essential for plant survival, have a wide range of interesting physiological effects, including antitumor, antiviral, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory, immunostimulatory, and antimalarial activities, some of them being of particular interest because of their potential use in clinical therapy (34).",

An important handicap is the availability of these alkaloids, which are obtained only in minute quantities from natural sources.

In the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, l-phe serves as a primary precursor of the C6\u2013C1 fragment, corresponding to ring A and the benzylic position (C-6), and l-tyr is the precursor of ring C, the two-carbon side chain (C-11 and C-12) and nitrogen, C6\u2013C2\u2013N. The conversion of l-phe to the C6\u2013C1 unit requires the loss of two carbon atoms from the side chain as well as the introduction of at least two oxygenated substituents into the aromatic ring, which is performed via cinnamic acids. The presence of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) has been demonstrated in Amaryllidaceae plants (182), and the elimination of ammonia mediated by this enzyme is known to occur in an antiperiplanar manner to give trans-cinnamic acid, with loss of the \u03b2-pro-S hydrogen (183). Thus, it may be expected that l-phe would be incorporated into Amaryllidaceae alkaloids with retention of the \u03b2-pro-R hydrogen. However, feeding experiments in Narcissus \u2018King Alfred\u2019 showed that tritium originally present at C-\u03b2 of l-phe, whatever the configuration, was lost in the formation of several hemanthamine- and homolycorine-type alkaloids, which led to the conclusion that fragmentation of the cinnamic acids involves the oxidation of C-\u03b2 to the ketone or acid level, the final product being protocatechuic aldehyde or its derivatives (Fig. 2\n). On the other hand, l-tyr is degraded no further than tyramine before incorporation into the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids.",

The absolute stereochemistry of these processes has been elucidated in subsequent experiments (194), and the results show that hydrogen addition and removal take place on the re-face of the molecules concerned (195), the initially introduced hydrogen being the one later removed (196). It is noteworthy that norpluviine (12), unlike pluviine (11), is converted in Narcissus \u2018King Alfred\u2019 primarily to alkaloids of the homolycorine type. Benzylic oxidation of position 6 would afford 95, followed by ring opening to form an amino aldehyde. Hemiacetal formation and methylation could provide lycorenine (35) (92), and, on subsequent oxidation, could afford homolycorine (26), as shown in Fig. 7\n.",

Consideration of the possible mechanisms involved in relation to tritium retention led to the suggestion that the tritium which is expected at C-4 of 53 might not be stereospecific (198). The conversion of O-methylnorbelladine (87) into hemanthamine (53) involves loss of the pro-R hydrogen from the C-\u03b2 of the tyramine moiety as well as the further entry of a hydroxyl group at this site (199). The subsequent benzylic oxidation results in a 55/56 epimeric mixture that even HPLC cannot separate. The epimeric forms were proposed to be interchangeable through 97. The biosynthetic conversion of the 5,10b-ethanophenanthridine alkaloids to the 2-benzopyrano[3,4-c]indole was demonstrated by feeding tritium-labeled alkaloids to Sprekelia formosissima. It was shown that this plant converts hemanthamine (53) to hemanthidine/epihemanthamine (55/56), and subsequently to pretazettine (64), in an essentially irreversible manner (200). This transformation was considered to proceed through 97 or the related alkoxide anion, although intermediate 97 have never been detected by spectral methods (201) (Fig. 9\n).",

In fact, in view of its structural affinity to both hemanthamine (53) and lycorine (1), narciclasine (68) could be derived by either of the pathways. When O-methylnorbelladine (87), labeled in the methoxy carbon and in both protons of positions 3 and 5 of the tyramine aromatic ring, was administered to Narcissus plants, all four alkaloids incorporated activity. The isotopic ratio [3H:14C] for norpluviine (12) and lycorine (1) was, as expected, 50% that of the precursor, because of its ortho\u2013para\u2032 coupling. On the contrary, in hemanthamine (53) the ratio was unchanged. These results show clearly that the methoxy group of 87 is completely retained in the alkaloids mentioned, providing a satisfactory internal standard and showing that the degree of tritium retention is a reliable guide to the direction of phenol coupling. Narciclasine (68) showed an isotopic ratio (75%) higher than that of lycorine (1) or norpluviine (12), though lower than that of hemanthamine (53). However, the fact that more than 50% of tritium is retained suggests that O-methylnorbelladine (87) is incorporated into narciclasine (68) via para\u2013para\u2032 phenol oxidative coupling.",

In particular, the group of Hudlicky which developed the methodology has devised short, efficient, and enantioselective total syntheses of alkaloids and related compounds to meet quantity demands for materials used in biological studies. Lycoricidine was prepared in only nine steps from bromobenzene (251), and the same starting material was used in straightforward syntheses of pancratistatin and its 7-deoxy derivative (252). Recently, the Hudlicky group published the synthesis of narciclasine (68), based on the whole-cell fermentation of 1,3-dibromobenzene by a recombinant Escherichia coli (Scheme 6\n). The resulting dienediol was subjected to a hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction with a nitroso derivative and the corresponding adduct underwent Suzuki coupling followed by reductive opening of the oxazine N\u2013O bond. Stereoselective reduction of the resulting ketone, exchange of the acetonide moiety with acetate groups, a Bischler\u2013Napieralski-type ring closure and the removal of the ester and phenolic methyl protecting groups led to the desired product (253).",

The pyrrolidine ring was closed via a cobalt-promoted intramolecular radical addition-dehydrogenation reaction (261). Parsons has reported model studies on the cyclization of diversely substituted 2-amino-cyclohex-2-enone derivatives to yield octahydroindole derivatives related to the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. In these processes, radical cyclizations were promoted with tributyltin hydride, samarium (II) iodide, or manganese (III) acetate (262). Curran has reported a radical cyclization leading to spirocyclohexadienones, which includes the formal synthesis of aza-galanthamine (263). Keck reported an impressive radical cascade process as the crucial step in his total synthesis of 7-deoxypancratistatin (264). A modified approach led to the synthesis of (+)-lycoricidine, via 6-exo-cyclizations of substituted alkenyl radicals with oxime ethers (265) (Scheme 8\n). The precursor was prepared from d-gulonolactone, which was protected, selectively transformed, and coupled through a Sonogashira reaction with a substituted iodoarene to yield the key alkyne intermediate. PhSH was added under photochemical activation to generate a vinyl radical, which was then added to the oxime ether moiety to close the six-membered ring with high stereoselectivity. Treatment of the resulting compound with SmI2 allowed the cleavage of the N\u2013O bond, the removal of the thioether, and the formation of the lactam. The final step was the deprotection of the acetonide group. Ent-lycoricidine, and (+)-narciclasine (68) have been similarly prepared.",

The alkaloids of the Narcissus genus are exclusively of the hemanthamine type, while in genera such as Brunsvigia, Boophane, etc., the crinine-type alkaloids are predominant. It is also noteworthy that the alkaloids isolated from the Narcissus genus do not show additional substitutions in the aromatic ring, apart from those of C-8 and C-9. On the contrary, in the genera where crinine-type alkaloids predominate, the presence of alkaloids with a methoxy substituent at C-7 is quite common. Thus, hemanthamine-type alkaloids show the following characteristics:a.Two singlets for the para-oriented aromatic protons.b.Using CDCl3 as the solvent, the magnitude of the coupling constants between each olefinic proton (H-1 and H-2) and H-3 gives information about the configuration of the C-3 substituent. Thus, in those alkaloids in which the two-carbon bridge (C-11 and C-12) is cis to the substituent at C-3, H-1 shows an allylic coupling with H-3 (J\n1,3\u223c1\u20132 Hz) and H-2 shows a smaller coupling with H-3 (J\n2,3\u223c0\u20131.5 Hz), as it occurs in crinamine (57). On the contrary, in the corresponding C-3 epimeric series, e.g. hemanthamine (53), a larger coupling between H-2 and H-3 (J\n2,3 5 Hz) is shown, the coupling between H-1 and H-3 not being detectable.c.There is frequently an additional coupling of H-2 with the equatorial H-4\u03b2 in a W-mechanism, while the proton H-4\u03b1 shows a large coupling with H-4a (J\n4\n\u03b1\n,4a\u223c13 Hz) due to their trans-diaxial disposition, characteristic of the hemanthamine series.d.Two doublets for an AB system corresponding to the benzylic protons of position C-6.e.The pairs of alkaloids with a hydroxy substituent at C-6, like papyramine/6-epipapyramine (48/49), hemanthidine/6-epihemanthidine (55/56), etc., appear as a mixture of epimers not separable even by HPLC.f.Also, in relation to position C-6, it is interesting to note that ismine (72), a catabolic product from the hemanthamine series, shows a restricted rotation around the biarylic bond, which makes the methylenic protons at the benzylic position magnetically non-equivalent.\n",

In the fourth century bc, Hippocrates of Cos (the \u2018Father of Medicine\u2019) recommended a pessary prepared from Narcissus oil (probably N. poeticus) for the management of uterine tumors (388). In the first century ad, Pliny the Elder also recorded the topical use of N. poeticus and N. pseudonarcissus for this purpose. It is now known that N. poeticus contains 0.012% of the antineoplastic agent narciclasine (68) in the fresh bulb 14., 101.. Arabian, North African, and Chinese medical practitioners of the Middle Ages continued using Narcissus oil in cancer treatment (389). For example, bulbs of N. tazetta L. var. chinensis, cultivated in China as a decorative plant, were used topically for the treatment of tumors in folk medicine. In this case, pretazettine (64) was established to be one of the antitumor active compounds 133., 390.. The bulbs of N. tazetta continue to be used in Turkey as a home remedy for the treatment of abscesses because of their antiphlogistic and analgesic properties (391).",

In plants, it also inhibits cyanide-insensitive respiration, peroxidase activity, and protein synthesis 451., 452., 453.. The effects of lycorine on l-Asc biosynthesis have been reported to occur at concentrations below those at which protein synthesis is affected, but it seems difficult to completely rule out non-specific effects of this alkaloid since it has been reported that, at least in yeasts, lycorine is able to interact directly with mitocondrial DNA. Thus, differing sensitivity to the alkaloid among cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA (rho\n0) and cells with mitochondrial DNA either rho\n+ or rho\n\u2212 has been found in yeasts 440., 448., 454., 455., rho\n0 cells being resistant to high concentrations of the drug 450., 456., 457., 458.. Some strains can even adapt to the presence of lycorine, because they are able to degrade the alkaloid and use its biotransformation products as growth-stimulating factors (458).",

It induces flat morphology in K-ras-NRK cells (transformed fibroblasts) (466), and reduces the cellular activity in femoral bone marrow tissue that results in granulocytic leucopenia and a decrease in the number of erythrocytes. This alkaloid's mechanism of action is thought to be through the inhibition of protein synthesis at the ribosomal level, even though the cytotoxic effects of calprotectin can also be suppressed using lycorine 424., 460., 461., 467., 468.. Lycorine also inhibits murine macrophage production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (469), and shows inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production and induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages (470). The molecular mechanism of lycorine against leukemia (human cell line HL-60) shows that it can suppress cell growth and reduce cell survival by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells (471). It displays pronounced cell growth inhibitory activities against both parental and multidrug resistant L5178 mouse lymphoma cell lines, but is almost inactive in inhibiting the glycoprotein responsible for the efflux-pump activity of tumor cells. Assays for interactions with tRNA revealed that the antiproliferative effects of lycorine result from its complex formation with tRNA (73). Interaction of lycorine (1), pseudolycorine (3), and 2-O-acetylpseudolycorine (5) with DNA has also been observed 472., 473..",

Lycorine and pseudolycorine also show inhibitory activity against the Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever viruses, but with low selectivity 480., 481.. Lycorine, in turn, acts as an anti-SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus) and shows pronounced activity against poliomyelitis, coxsackie, and herpes type 1 viruses 20., 482.. It possesses high antiretroviral activity accompanied by low therapeutic indices (483). The relationship between its structure and the mechanism of activity has been studied in the Herpes simplex virus, suggesting that alkaloids that may eventually prove to be antiviral agents have a hexahydroindole ring with two functional hydroxyl groups (484). The activity was found to be due to the inhibition of multiplication, and not to the direct inactivation of extracellular viruses, and the mechanism of the antiviral effect was partially explained as a blocking of viral DNA polymerase activity 33., 413., 479., 485..",

The analgesic activity exhibited by the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids is attributed to their resemblance to the morphine and codeine skeletons. Lycorine also has antiarrhythmic action, and lycorine hydrochloride is a strong broncholytic (30). In fact, lycorine shows a relaxant effect on an isolated epinephrine-precontracted pulmonary artery and increases contractility and the rate of an isolated perfused heart. These effects are mediated by stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (491).",

In fact, pretazettine strongly inhibits the activity of reverse transcriptase from various oncogenic viruses by binding to the enzyme (20). It inhibits both the growth of the Rauscher virus and cellular protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by a mechanism that does not affect DNA and RNA synthesis, even though it has a pronounced DNA-binding activity 415., 424., 467., 472., 481., 507., 511..

It also retards DNA synthesis (516) and inhibits calprotectin-induced cytotoxicity at a more than 10-fold lower concentration than lycorine (1) (468). The peculiar effects of narciclasine seem to arise from the functional groups and conformational freedom of its C-ring (122), with the 7-hydroxyl group believed to be important in its biological activity (253). This alkaloid, related to pancratistatin (516), is one of the most important antineoplastic Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (460) and shows some promise as an anticancer agent. It inhibits HeLa cell growth, has antileukemic properties and is active against a variety of tumor cells, such as human and murine lymphocytic leukemia, larynx, and cervix carcinomas, and Ehrlich tumor cells 33., 77., 386., 388., 389., 516..

Thus, indole-3-acetic acid cannot overcome the inhibition of elongation of wheat coleoptile sections caused by narciclasine. Additionally, narciclasine suppresses the gibberellin-induced \u03b1-amylase production in barley seeds and cytokinin-induced expansion and greening of excised radish cotyledons (120). Like lycorine (1), narciclasine also inhibits ascorbic acid biosynthesis (305). Narciclasine, present in daffodil mucilage, can delay tepal senescence in cut Iris flowers by attenuation of protease activity, which, in turn, is apparently related to the inhibition of the protein synthesis involved in senescence (519). At the organelle level, narciclasine inhibits both isocitrate lyase (ICL) activity in glyoxysomes and hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR) activity in peroxysomes. It also blocks the formation of chloroplasts, markedly reducing the chlorophyll content of light-grown wheat seedlings, probably due to the inhibition of the formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid, an essential chlorophyll precursor (520). The formation of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein (LHCP) is also inhibited by this alkaloid (521).",

Galanthamine has the ability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and act within the central nervous system 525., 526.. It binds at the base of the active site gorge of acetylcholinesterase, interacting with both the choline-binding site and the acyl-binding pocket, having a number of moderate-to-weak interactions with the protein 527., 528., 529.. In addition, galanthamine stimulates pre- and postsynaptic nicotinic receptors which can, in turn, increase the release of neurotransmitters, thus directly stimulating neuronal function 524., 530.. It is also suggested that the stimulation of nicotinic receptors protects against apoptosis induced by \u03b2-amyloid toxicity 524., 531., 532.. Its dual mode of action (527), coupled with the evidence that galanthamine has reduced side effects, make it a promising candidate for the treatment of nervous diseases, paralysis syndrome, schizophrenia, and other forms of dementia, as well as Alzheimer's disease 524., 527., 528..",

Owing to the relative lack of alternative treatment, galanthamine (75) is a reasonable approximation of the ideal concept of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease therapy 523., 535.. Galanthamine hydrobromide (a third-generation cholinesterase inhibitor used against Alzheimer's disease) offers superior pharmacological profiles and increased tolerance compared to the original acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, physostigmine or tacrine 536., 537., 538., 539., 540.. Galanthamine is effective and well tolerated, resulting in short-term improvements in cognition, function, and daily life activities in patients with mild to moderate symptoms 530., 541., 542.. However, long-term benefits beyond 6 months are in question (543), because persistent elevation of acetylcholine may lead to over-stimulation of both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the former causing receptor desensitization and the latter potentially causing an increased frequency of cholinergic side effects 524., 530., 544.. The safety profile of galanthamine, as well as its clinical effectiveness, will only be demonstrated after large-scale clinical trials 544., 545., 546..",

            "text": "Broadly speaking, the development of galanthamine (75) into a widely used Alzheimer's drug can be divided into three main periods: (1) the early development in Eastern Europe for its use in the treatment of poliomyelitis; (2) the pre-clinical development in the 1980s; and (3) the clinical development in the 1990s (544). Galanthamine hydrobromide was first used by Bulgarian and Russian researchers in the 1950s and exploited for a variety of clinical purposes. It has been used clinically for postsurgery reversal of tubocurarine-induced muscle relaxation and for treating post-polio paralysis, myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular diseases, as well as traumatic brain injuries 547., 548.. As early as 1972, Soviet researchers demonstrated that galanthamine could reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice, a finding that was demonstrated in man 4 years later. However, this alkaloid was not applied to Alzheimer's disease until 1986, long after the widely accepted cholinergic hypothesis had been first postulated, when researchers in Western Europe switched their attention to galanthamine because of its ability to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier and specifically to augment the central cholinergic function 544., 549.. This led to clinical trials of galanthamine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In 1996, Sanochemia Pharmazeutika in Austria first launched galanthamine as \u2018NIVALIN\u00ae\u2019, but its strictly limited availability meant the international pharmaceutical community adopted a cautions approach 181., 550., until Sanochemia Pharmazeutika developed a method to synthetically produce the compound in 1997 (551). Later, galanthamine was co-developed by Shire Pharmaceuticals (Great Britain) and the Janssen Research Foundation (Belgium), who have launched galanthamine as \u2018REMINIL\u00ae\u2019 in many countries 524., 544.. This renewed interest is reflected in the increasing number of scientific reviews concerned exclusively with galanthamine and its derivatives 522., 525., 526., 530., 538., 539., 547., 552., 553., 554., 555..",
