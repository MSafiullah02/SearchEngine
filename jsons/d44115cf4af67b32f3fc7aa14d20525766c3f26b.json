            "text": "Many infectious/communicable diseases (IDs) are endemic in Nepal. Until a decade and half ago, IDs were the major cause of both morbidity and mortality accounting 70% for both. However, as a result of various preventive measures implemented by both the state and non-state actors, the overall IDs have shown a changing (declining) trend. The most impressive decline has been seen in the intestinal helminth infection. Though the overall burden of IDs is decreasing, several newer infectious diseases (emerging infections) namely, dengue fever, scrub typhus, influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), and others are posing a great public health problem. On the other hand, though sporadic, outbreaks of endemic diseases together with HIV-TB coinfection and infection with drug resistance microbes during recent years have constituted a serious public health as well as medical problem. On the contrary, with the decline of IDs, noninfectious diseases (noncommunicable disease, NCD) namely, diabetes, cancer (and cancer therapy), and others are on the rise particularly in urban areas. Hence, currently Nepal is trapped in \"double burden\" of diseases. Risk of opportunistic infection has increased in immunocompromised person with NCD. To address the present situation, the multi-sectoral plan and strategies developed must be implemented effectively.",

Many children were dying due to easily preventable communicable diseases primarily diarrhea and/or dysentery, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and other respiratory infections. Until two decades ago, intestinal parasitic infection in some communities was very high (over 70%) and multi-parasitic infection was common [8] [9] [10] [11] . Among the soil-transmitted helminth infection, Ascaris lumbricoides infection alone was over 75% in some communities with a mean annual prevalence of 35% among patients visiting a teaching hospital in capital city, Kathmandu [10] [11] [12] . Over one-third of soil samples tested revealed helminth parasites eggs [13] .",

Approximately four percent of deaths are associated with diarrheal disease. Enteropathogens have been detected in over two-third of diarrheal feces [19] . Among the travelers, diarrhea is usually caused by Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella sp., Vibrio cholerae, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Cyclospora cayetanensis, and Cryptosporidium parvum including Rotavirus and other viruses [20] .",

As a result, according to a systematic review, a sharp decrease in prevalence of STHs among school-aged children in Nepal in last decade with prevalence dropping below 5% for each of STHs with no variation in prevalence in rural and urban areas has been achieved ( Fig. 2 ) [15] . Intestinal parasites particularly STH are known to cause malnutrition and its associated manifestations. Previous studies from Nepal have established that STH cause anemia, vitamin A deficiency, and other micronutrient deficiency among Nepalese [40, 41] . This might have contributed in the decreasing proportion of malnourished children during recent years [5] .",

Also, different non-state actors have been conducting rabies control activities over the years [42, 43] . During the period of 1992-1996, a total of 181 human rabid cases were reported (diagnosed clinically; among them one which was diagnosed by mouse inoculation) and were from 37 different Districts with the history of dog bite [44] . Per year, rabies is reported to kill about 100 livestock and 10-100 humans, while about 1,000 livestock and 35,000 humans are reported to receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis, however, these estimates are very likely to be serious underestimations of the true rabies burden [45] (Fig. 3 ).",

It is associated with low socioeconomic status, low literacy rate, and lack of good governance. To address the problems associated with poverty, government has implemented a plan to eliminate the KA from Nepal by 2015 with the reduction of poverty incidence from existing poverty 27% (2010) to at least 16% in KA endemic areas [66, 67] . Because of the implementation of comprehensive KA elimination plan and program, total KA cases and deaths have shown a significant decrease during last 13 years (Fig. 6 ). However, KA has shown changing epidemiology recently (cases endemic only in eastern Terai region have now spread to western Terai as well as some hilly Districts) [67] .",

Accordingly, none of the hospitals studied had an infection control team (ICT). Common HAI causing bacteria in Nepal includes Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., and others. Most of these HAI bacterial isolates are MDR. These bacteria are mainly associated with urinary tract infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, surgical site and implant-associated infection, catheter site infection, and soft tissue infections. This is primarily due to high microbial (bacteria and fungi) burden in hospital environment and high pathogen career rate among staffs (hands: 59.2% and nose: 73.7%) mainly S. aureus and most of them were highly drug resistant) [88] .",

Many outbreaks occurred in the year 2013. This resulted into great loss in economy particularly to poultry farmers and farm associated business (egg, meat, and feed business). As a result, government provided compensation to the poultry farmers and businesses concerned for the loss of chicks, eggs, bird feed, and chicken due to the spread of bird flu at six different places. To control H5N1, special plan, program and activities were launched and Nepal has been declared free of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in May 2014 [108] .

In recent studies, over half of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were tested, and over 30% of some Shigella sp. and Vibrio cholerae isolates were resistant to first-line antibiotics and many other important bacterial pathogens are highly resistant to most first-line and some second-line antibiotics [127] .

Due to the indiscriminate and prolonged use of antibiotics in meat animals, high level of antibiotic residues has been found in the marketed meat and consumable broiler chicken liver, in particular, showed very high percentage of antibiotic residue [128] .

Moreover, more than 52% of the diarrheal cases are being treated by Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), the interface between healthcare facility and community. This may be the reason that spread and outbreak of various infectious diseases predicted after the earthquake 2015 did not occur. Infectious diseases are common in villages, but town and cities are not completely free of infectious diseases. Interestingly, some of the outbreaks of infectious diseases are occurring only in the town and cities. However, the overall prevalence of infectious diseases has come down. However, unusually heavy rainfall, floods, and landslide are creating good environment for the spread of infectious diseases.",
