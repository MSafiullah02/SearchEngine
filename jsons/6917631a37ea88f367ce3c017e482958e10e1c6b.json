Daily training focuses on muscle strengthening, sharpening fine-motor skills and increasing endurance. Because the heart and lungs are the true ''engine'' of the athlete, much time and attention are given to the cardiopulmonary system during training sessions to maximize performance. Even the slightest change in cardiac output or ventilatory function can have dramatic effects on how well the athlete is able to compete. Environmental factors on playing fields and in arenas can negatively influence performance, as can a variety of infectious agents passed by teammates, competitors, or family members. Below is a review of the common infections and environmental conditions encountered in the care of athletes.",

Oxygen is delivered to the brain and skeletal muscle while the waste products of carbon dioxide and lactic acid are cleared. Cardiac output (CO) is a standard measurement of the volume of blood provided to the systemic circulation per minute and is determined by the product of the heart rate (HR) per minute and the stroke volume (SV; CO = HR \u00c2 SV). An athlete's cardiac output is regulated and influenced by a multitude of factors, including systemic venous resistance, ventricular compliance, after-load pressures, and intravascular blood volumes. Fever, dehydration, and environmental and body temperatures can all alter how efficiently the heart distributes blood to the tissues.",

The Starling curve accurately depicts the balance between stroke volume and filling pressures, as seen in Fig. 1 . If left-ventricular end diastolic pressure increases and stretches the myocardial fibers beyond their normal capacity, cardiac output falls off rapidly. Diseased myocardium loses its compliance and inherent ability to react to different filling pressures and volumes, which then results in a very narrow physiologic window for proper cardiac output.",

This quantifies how much oxygen in milliliters is used in one minute per kilogram of body weight. Obviously, optimal pulmonary function is crucial to the efficient diffusion of oxygen from the atmosphere across the alveolar wall into the capillary. Nasopharyngeal congestion, bronchial edema, or smooth muscle hypertrophy can limit the amount of oxygen that is delivered to the alveoli. The cardiovascular system's transport and the muscles' ability to use delivered oxygen also factor into the VO 2 max determination. As an athlete's conditioning improves, so too does her VO 2 max, up to her highest genetic potential. When VO 2 max levels fall, athletic performance will subsequently decline as well. Deciphering which part of this physiologic cascade is problem- atic can be a diagnostic challenge, but is crucial to restoration of full function in the athlete.",

There is an ongoing debate over the questions surrounding exercise's harmful or beneficial effects on immune function, with both sides providing wellconducted studies stating their case. Certain physiologic changes unarguably occur when the athlete becomes ill or run-down. Fever is a natural response to infection, and triggers a cascade of events that change cardiopulmonary performance. Fever stimulates vasodilatation, which decreases systemic venous return, limiting preload filling pressures and eventually leading to a decrease in cardiac output. The heart must then increase its rate to make up for the diminished volume. Increased respiratory rates develop to compensate for the increased temperature and the increased demand for oxygen to active inflammatory cells. Fever is also responsible for immune-mediator activation via neutrophils, lymphoctyes, and cytokines. These cells cause increased capillary permeability, which allows the host defense system access to the tissues where the infection is occurring. This process can lead to bronchial mucosal edema and shifts in extracellular fluid levels, both of which compromise the ability to deliver oxygen to the athlete's skeletal muscle.",

The athlete's body depends on an appropriate hydration level not only to deliver nutrients to the muscles, but also to aid in core-cooling processes such as sweating. Suboptimal hydration can result in muscle tetany (cramping), hyperthermia, and decreased cardiac output and VO 2 max. When athletes are ill, it is crucial that they increase not only their fluid intake but also their general caloric intake as well, because the activated immune system increases caloric expenditures well above resting states. There is an inverse relationship between plasma glucose levels and activation of stress hormones such as cortisol. One theory postulates that maintaining higher plasma glucose levels through the consumption of carbohydrate drinks during prolonged exertion decreases cortisol levels and in turn, places less demand on the immune system [1] .",

Previously sedentary women were randomized to near-daily walking or remaining sedentary for 3 to 4 months. The active group reported half as many days with URTI symptoms. Brisk walking for 30 to 45 minutes at least five times per week showed the greatest decrease in symptoms [2, 3] . Moderate exercise is believed to stimulate the function of natural killer cells; however, strenuous activity may actually suppress neutrophil function [4, 5] . Increased minute ventilation with exercise may help ciliary function in clearing pathogens from the nasotracheal and bronchial tissue. The magnitude of change in the immune system during actual exercise is largely unknown or quantified, but many studies have failed to show large differences in certain immune levels in the postexercise resting state between athletes and nonathletes [6] . Therefore, the duration of these exercise effects on the immune system is unknown. Strenuous exercise, however, appears to be different from mild to moderate levels. Marathoners and triathletes may be particularly susceptible to infectious agents during a window of time following their training or competition. Table 1 lists the transient effects recorded after strenuous exercise.",

Studies revealed a decline in this amino acid during exercise, and it was postulated that this may be a cause for the increased risk of viral infections. Subsequent glutamine supplementation studies have given no clinically significant results in boosting the immune systems of athletes [7,8,] . Therefore, until we perfect our assay analysis techniques and truly understand the intricacies of the immune system, it will be hard to conclusively say how much exercise is safe for the immune system and how long it is run down after bouts of heavy exertion. For now, it appears that regular, moderate-intensity exercise can be beneficial to the immune status. Those participating in more strenuous events should realize the potential for infection and make it a priority to rest sufficiently after training and competition, and to replenish energy stores, hydration levels, and vitamins.",

The incidence varies by season, age of the athlete, climate, and level of exertion. More serious infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia may begin with symptoms similar to a URTI. Most current Table 1 Immune system changes after heavy exertion [ literature demonstrates the athlete's susceptibility to viral but not bacterial infections. As mentioned previously, there is good evidence that supports the belief that mild to moderate exercise has positive effects on the immune system's ability to ward off infection. Because of the relatively high prevalence of URTI, much research has focused on different ways to prevent these common ailments, which can affect performance or delay participation for days and weeks. The common cold lasts 5 to 10 days and its symptoms are generally mild enough so as not to prevent the athlete from continuing training or competing. Rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses are the usual perpetrators, though rarely is testing done in a clinical setting to identify which of these is actively infecting the patient. Simple decongestants and cough suppressants often provide adequate relief of symptoms. Care must be taken to review the lists of banned substances in collegiate, professional, and Olympic sports before prescribing them. Weidner et al demonstrated the effects of a URTI caused by rhinovirus 16. A wellconducted trial showed no significant difference between those inoculated with the virus versus those receiving placebo at days 2, 5, and 8 in pulmonary function, VO 2 max, and exercise to fatigue [9] . This supports the concept that there are few physiologic changes in the athlete's body during an uncomplicated URTI, and athletes should be considered medically appropriate for return to participation even while symptomatic.",

The true incidence of cardiac infection in athletes is unknown, but because of its possible devastating effects, physicians and trainers must remain alert for any signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac involvement with any type of ailment. Unfortunately, those signs are often nonspecific and can be very mild. Chest pain with or without radiation, new onset of dyspnea with exercise, or changes in heart rate or blood pressure following a systemic illness should signal the need to perform appropriate testing. Obscure symptoms of prolonged fatigue or low-grade temperatures may also suggest an indolent infection in the myocardium. Myocarditis describes the inflammatory state of the myocardium, as evidenced in the clinical changes on both electrocardiogram (ECG) and at the cellular level on myocardial biopsy. Symptoms at the onset may include the following: fatigue, fluid retention, fever, or palpitations. Signs may include tachycardia or irregular rhythms, or an S3 heart sound may be appreciated on auscultation. White-blood-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated in the serum, though absence of either does not rule out the disease. ECG changes may include sinus tachycardia or subtle, nonspecific ST segment wave changes. This can be misleading in athletes who display traits characteristic of the athletic heart. Normal ECG findings with these patients may show sinus arrhythmia, junctional escape beats, first-degree AV block or second-degree block (Mobitz type I), increased voltage, or increased QT intervals [15] . Thus, differentiating between a normal athletic heart and the pathologic heart of myocarditis can be difficult. Though invasive, myocardial biopsy may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Plain chest radiograph may be unremarkable or may reveal cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. Echocardiograms may show akinetic wall-motion abnormalities and evidence of ventricular hypertrophy, dilation, or decreased ejection fraction.",

If enough myocytes are damaged, the ventricles in particular lose their inherent strength and congestive heart failure may ensue. The dangers for the athlete who develops myocarditis are twofold. The shortterm fear lies in the fact that as myocytes are destroyed and scar tissue is laid down, an arrythmogenic substrate is created. As with myocardium destroyed by ischemia, this tissue may conduct electrical currents at different velocities from healthy cells and result in a variety of arrhythmias, from atrial premature complexes to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. All athletes with suspected or confirmed myocarditis must stop exercising because of the inherent increased risk for malignant rhythms and sudden cardiac death.

Four stages of ECG changes can occur with the natural progression of pericarditis. Stage I shows an elevated ST segment and upright T waves, often across multiple precordial leads. In stage II, the ST elevation returns to normal and the T wave becomes upright flat. The T wave becomes inverted in stage III and returns to near normal in stage IV [19] erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocytes may be elevated transiently. Treatment consists of rest for the athlete until he is symptom free and the ECG returns to normal. Most viral or idiopathic cases respond well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. The most serious complications are rare in otherwise healthy individuals, but include pericardial effusion with or without tamponade. If the effusion is large enough or develops rapidly enough, its pressure on the ventricle can lead to rapid cardiac decompensation. It is best diagnosed by echocardiogram and requires immediate drainage by pericardiocentesis. Constrictive pericarditis can also develop as a result of the acute inflammation. This leads to thickened, noncompliant pericardium, which does not allow proper filling during diastole and results in decreased cardiac output. Patients with these complications may never be able to return to the playing fields of their sports. Formal cardiology consultation for athletic clearance is essential.",

Ozone concentration in the atmosphere is measured in parts per million (ppm) and cities like Los Angeles have levels of between 0.15 and 0.35 ppm. Adams et al studied 10 male distance runners and exposed them to varying levels of O 3 , then measured their forced vital capacity (FVC) and their FEV1.

There was no control group, but the studied athletes showed significant improvements in their 3000-meter race times. VO 2 max was increased by 3% from baseline and EPO levels doubled [35] . Altitude acclimation is essential to allow the body time to adapt and recover from the strain of lower oxygenation on the cardiopulmonary system. These effects are acquired and transient in most individuals. Only athletes born and raised at higher altitudes appear to retain any long-term benefits of such altitude exposure.",

Even those people born at high altitudes need appropriate time to respond to such low-oxygen environments. In order to supply the body with increased levels of oxygen when the available resources are low, respiratory rates must increase. Increased respiratory rates will decrease carbon dioxide levels, often resulting in a respiratory alkalosis, which is responsible for many of the symptoms of acute mountain sickness(AMS). Headache, nausea, fatigue, and insomnia can appear as early as several hours after ascent to 2000 to 2500 meters. This syndrome is typically short lived and remedied with rest, proper hydration, or supplemental oxygen. Severe cases may need all of the above and descent to lower altitude. Acetozolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, facilitates the release of bicarbonate in the kidneys and produces a 74% improvement in symptoms compared with placebo [36] . Dexamethasone has shown similar results [37] .",

Incidence worldwide varies, but was estimated at 0.01% to 0.1% of visitors in the late 1970s to early 1980s at the Colorado ski resorts [38] . It is rarely seen below 2500 meters and typically presents 1 or 2 days after reaching a new altitude, but does not usually occur after spending 4 days at the same height [39] . Low-grade fever or rales may be present and pre-existing URTIs or bronchitis may put people at a higher risk for developing HAPE, especially children [40] . Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans often reveal a patchy infiltrate pattern. Only late in the disease course does pink, frothy sputum or frank hemoptysis develop. Its pathophysiology appears to be related to altered perfusion, from vasoconstriction in pulmonary capillaries in response to diminished oxygen levels. Pulmonary hypertension ensues, as does elevated capillary wedge pressure, which some researchers believe is the cause of the pulmonary edema [41] . Those who develop HAPE once have a much higher rate of recurrence on subsequent trips.",

In severe cases or if descent is not immediately possible, nifedipine has proven to be beneficial for relieving symptoms by reducing pulmonary artery pressures by 30%. It has also been proven to decrease the incidence of HAPE recurrence in susceptible climbers [42] . Some experts recommend ascending no more than 300 to 350 meters per day as a means of preventing altitude-related conditions. Cremona and colleagues studied 262 consecutive climbers of a 4559-meter peak, both before ascent (at 1200 meters) and one hour after arrival at the summit ( $ 15hrs later). Evaluations included chest radiographs, lung auscultation, oximetry, spirometry, carbon monoxide transfer, and closing volume. Interestingly, they found that 15% of the subjects had chest rales or interstitial edema on chest radiograph. Of those without edema, 74% had increased closing volumes, suggestive of subclinical pulmonary edema. Only one climber was evacuated for HAPE. They proposed that larger lung size at baseline is protective against HAPE because of intrinsically lower vascular resistance associated with larger lung cross-sectional area [43] . This study suggests that a much higher incidence of pulmonary edema may exist with rapid ascent than was previously thought.",

At sea level, the body is subject to ambient pressures measured at 1 atmospheric absolute of pressure (ATA). As the diver descends into the water, these pressures double at 33 feet, triple at 66 feet, and so on. Fluidfilled organs are not affected, but air-filled organs such as the middle ear and the lungs are susceptible to pressure-related injury, so-called barotrauma. With descent, gases such as nitrogen become soluble and dissolve into a liquid state, whereas with ascent, solubility decreases and they return to their gaseous state. Ascending too quickly causes these gases to precipitate into bubbles, which can be harmful to the closed network of the cardiovascular system. Collectively, these changes result in decompression sickness (the bends).",

Bubbles in the skin or lymph system can develop as well, and these manifestations are known as type I decompression sickness. When the heart, lungs, or nervous system are affected, it is classified as type II. With improper ascent, arterial gas embolisms may occur from ruptured alveoli secondary to barotrauma (known as pulmonary overinflation syndrome) [44] . Improper ascent occurs when the diver rises too quickly or fails to exhale on ascent. After alveolar rupture, bubbles may enter the pulmonary venous system and then travel through the left atrium and into the systemic arterial circulation. These bubbles may then travel to the brain or spinal cord, causing cerebral vascular accidents, or rarely to the coronary arteries, causing myocardial infarction. In recreational divers, neurologic events comprise 80% of reported cases of decompression problems. Those divers with decompression illness without a history of a faulty ascent should be screened for a patent foramen ovale. This right-to-left shunt may allow venous bubbles access to the arterial circulation [45] .",

In addition, fluids are recommended either orally or intravenously. Steroids may be useful if neurologic damage is suspected. Diazepam can help minimize vertigo and nausea if there is vestibular damage to the ears [46] . Length of treatment and the severity and duration of symptoms dictate levels of pressure.
