Several G. duodenalis isolates that affect humans may be transmitted experimentally to various animal species, although the specific role of the dog in the epidemiology of human giardiasis still needs to be established (Monis and Thompson, 2003).",

This behavior may explain false-negative diagnoses or under-estimations. Bemrick (1963) noted that although some animals may develop persistent infections and the possibility of re-infection cannot be rejected. In this study it should be emphasized that hygiene, water quality, food and environmental conditions were controlled throughout the experimental period, to avoid contamination and re-infection. Zajac et al. (1992) observed experimentally infected dogs to be positive after treatment and suggested that they suppressed parasite levels, with latent potential for recrudescence of infection.

However clinical giardiasis is reported and is associated with dogs (Leib and Zajac, 1995). The factors that determine the pathogenicity of infection are poorly understood, but clinical disease may be associated with the number or altered distribution of trophozoites in the duodenal mucosa (Zajac, 1992). It is also possible that human isolates used in these studies did not produce significant pathogenicity in dogs.",

Studies such as those of Olivares et al. (2002), Olivares et al. (2004) and Heazlewood (1987), reported deficiencies of iron, Vitamin B12 and folic acid in people infected with G. duodenalis. However, the mechanism that the parasite uses to promote these alterations in humans is unclear. There is no information in the literature on deficiencies in iron, Vitamin B12 and folic acid in dogs with giardiasis. The profile of anemia and the lower mean values of group A in relation to the other groups may be related to the type of inoculum administered and/or the numbers of the form inoculated, which could result in the development of pathogenicity. Another possibility is that a physical barrier was created between the intestinal epithelium and lumen, resulting from rapid multiplication of the trophozoites by binary fission and interfering with nutrient absorption (Faubert, 2000).",

Neutrophils are attracted to the tissues in response to stimuli from the inflamed area, influencing the number of these cells in the circulating blood, as well as the liberation of immature neutrophils. These neutrophils that migrate to the tissues do not return to the circulating blood but are directed to organs such as the lungs, intestinal tract, liver and spleen (Osgood, 1954). The presence of G. duodenalis in the intestinal tract is associated with the development of the inflammatory process in the epithelium (Jimenez et al., 2004), which could have influenced in the dynamics of the neutrophils observed in the present study.",

Bordeau (1993) described dogs with giardiasis as presenting a tendency to eosinophilia. Although our results cannot be characterized as demonstrating absolute eosinophilia, the oscillations observed in groups A and B relative to the control may be associated with the presence of G. duodenalis, principally at 15 p.i., and thus concurrent with observed alterations in the erythrogram. Studies with mice inoculated with G. duodenalis demonstrate that eosinophils participate actively in the host immune response (Jimenez et al., 2004).",
