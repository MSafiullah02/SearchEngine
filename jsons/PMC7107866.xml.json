The risk to unvaccinated persons is 37%\u201362% if the source is positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and is 23%\u201337% if the source is negative for HBeAg and positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Transmission from environmental surfaces can occur even without a cutaneous injury [4]. Fortunately, HBV vaccination is highly effective and eliminates this risk for the 90% who respond to the primary series. For those who do not respond, repeat vaccination may protect 30%\u201350%. Before repeating the series, check antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and HBsAg to ensure that the patient is not a chronic HBV carrier. Deep intramuscular injection with a longer needle may be needed for larger recipients [4]. If serostatus is negative after 6 immunizations, there is no benefit to additional vaccine. Seronegative HCWs remain at high risk for hepatitis B if exposed, and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (0.06 mL/kg intramuscularly) should be offered after injury and repeated in 1 month [4]. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin started within 1 week of exposure provides \u223c75% protection [4]. Tenofovir and lamivudine have activity against HBV, but there is no guidance for prophylactic use in this setting. Consider administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin before departure for seronegative HCWs when concern exists for HBV exposure in a remote setting. Passive antibody half-life is 3 weeks, and levels are measurable for \u223c2 months [5].",

PEP is most effective if started immediately and definitely should be started within 3 days of exposure; PEP must be continued for 4 weeks [4, 7, 8]. Unlike HIV treatment, for which the use of triple-drug combinations is an essential success factor, 3 drugs are unlikely to be significantly better than 2 for PEP and paradoxically may be less effective, given that adherence to 3-drug regimens is poorer because of toxicity of the multidrug regimen. Zidovudine monotherapy is 79% effective in preventing infection [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors from the country's first-line regimen and 3 drugs if the source patient is known to be infected with drug-resistant HIV or if there is >15% resistance in the community [8]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a 3-drug PEP regimen if the source patient is known to be infected with HIV and the source device is a hollow-bore needle or has visible blood contamination. The CDC recommends zidovudine, stavudine, or tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine. When a third drug is included, both the CDC and WHO recommend a ritonavirboosted protease inhibitor, not nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [8, 9]. HCWs are strongly encouraged to bring postexposure medications to their destination.",

The CDC recommends treatment of latent tuberculosis with 9 months of isoniazid or 4 months of rifampin [55]. When latent tuberculosis is diagnosed after travel to high-risk areas, infection with MDR or XDR tuberculosis must be considered. If exposure to MDR or XDR tuberculosis is not reported or is unlikely, standard treatment is indicated. When the risk is significant or definite exposure occurs, treatment based on the suspected or known susceptibility of MDR and XDR tuberculosis exposure can be considered. This approach is often taken in the United States but is based on expert opinion and is controversial. Treatment may include 6\u201312 months of either ethambutol or pyrazinamide with levofloxacin or moxifloxacin [56]. The CDC recommends clinical and radiographic follow-up for 24 months for those with latent tuberculosis likely due to MDR or XDR pathogens, regardless of whether treatment of latent tuberculosis occurs. If tuberculosis develops, rapid identification of resistance is critical. Molecular detection of drug resistance is available at the CDC and at some state health departments. Consultation with an expert is strongly advised. Assistance is available from health departments or the CDC's Regional Training and Medical Consultation Centers [57].",
