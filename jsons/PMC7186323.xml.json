Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for patient isolation and prompt clinical interventions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly specific test and the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the variable sensitivity of RT-PCR and its lengthy turnaround time (24\u201348 h [2]) underscore the need for a complementary diagnostic approach [3\u20136]. Besides, multiple negative RT-PCR test results may be needed to rule out the disease in patients with a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 [7].",

RT-PCR is the confirmatory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with high specificity. Numerous studies have endorsed the important role of CT in the management of these patients. However, several scientific societies have recommended against the routine use of CT for the screening of COVID-19 [8, 9]. Some countries have established the use of imaging as their frontline diagnostic test [2, 5, 7]. In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed patients, CT examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a study on 1014 patients [5]. The diagnostic value of this modality has been proven in clinically suspicious cases with inconclusive laboratory test results, as well as asymptomatic individuals with known exposure [3, 10]. In many healthcare settings, such as developing countries, CT imaging may be the only available diagnostic test due to a shortage of diagnostic laboratory kits, while validated COVID-19 laboratory test kits are limited in quantity even in industrialized nations [7, 11].",

Our systematic review of the CT manifestations of COVID-19 showed a substantial inconsistency in description of imaging findings across the growing number of published studies [17]. We encountered the common use of several ambiguous and non-specific terms, such as fibrous stripes (or striped fibrosis), fibrotic streaks, lung fiber cord focus, vacuolar sign, bronchus distortion, patchy shadows, hazy opacities, patchy opacities, airspace disease, and interstitial disease [17\u201321]. While cardiothoracic radiologists may be familiar with some of these terms, the present variability in lexicon may be confusing for other radiology sub-specialties and referring healthcare providers. To ensure coherent and consistent communication between the healthcare providers, development of a standardized reporting format and lexicon is essential. It will also be vital for the ongoing clinical research, as well as an efficient organization of imaging data input for infectious disease registries.",

            "text": "We updated our published systematic review of chest CT manifestations of COVID-19, which was performed using a search of PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and the WHO database of COVID-19 literature on February 19, 2020, and included 30 studies [17]. For the purpose of the current proposal, seven studies that were published after our initial search were added, and a total of 37 studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT were included [5, 17, 19, 22\u201326]. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. A summary of the most common chest CT findings is reported in Table 1. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature, including Fleischner Society\u2019s Glossary of Terms for Thoracic Imaging [27]. Using this approach, we composed a comprehensive lexicon that includes the most pertinent terms and can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical imaging findings in COVID-19 patients (Table 2). Using the same data, we propose the COVID-19 imaging reporting and data system (COVID-RADS), which is a grading system for CT findings with five categories (Table 3). Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary COVID-19 involvement. The levels of suspicion that we proposed here are based on the similarity between the findings of a given imaging exam and the typical CT manifestations of COVID-19 that are reported in the available literature. In other words, the proposed levels of suspicion are not based on the empirical data and the \u201ctrue\u201d suspicion levels are based on the clinical context and the level of pretest probability. The diagnosis should be made based on the whole clinical picture and confirmed based on the RT-PCR test results. Representative CT images along with corresponding COVID-RADS report cards are presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Normal chest CT findings (COVID-RADS 0) or atypical features (COVID-RADS 1) are generally inconsistent with pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19. However, these features have been reported in a number of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic patients, hence indicating a low level of suspicion in our proposed grading system. Based on the current literature, the vast majority of the patients present with typical chest CT findings (COVID-RADS 3), which are commonly described as a peripheral, multifocal ground glass pattern. Typical findings are associated with the temporal stage of the disease but occasionally indicate the presence of complications. For instance, single ground glass opacity (GGO) is a fairly typical finding that may be present at the very early stages of the disease, while multifocal GGO, GGO with superimposed consolidation, and consolidation predominant pattern may be seen at progression/complicated stage. Linear opacities, crazy paving pattern, and white lung can be observed later in the course of progression/complicated stage. Imaging signs of remission, which may appear after the second week of the disease, include the melted sugar sign and parenchymal fibrotic bands [17, 18, 21, 28]. Some of the typical findings may be observed across different stages of the disease and interval changes in imaging studies should be taken into consideration for proper staging. Regardless, the typical findings denote a high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement in COVID-19.",

It may guide radiologists for now, but is not yet a validated system (as with other RADS). Clinicians should interpret COVID-RADS as just one part of the diagnostic puzzle and take into account the whole clinical picture. Furthermore, our understanding of the chest imaging features of COVID-19 is rapidly expanding and the current proposal is bound to the level of evidence of the studies that it is derived from, majority of which are case reports and small case series. While standardized reporting systems are intended to promote consistency, radiologists may need to adapt our proposed system based on their local or institutional policies and future guidelines. The Reporting and Data Systems (RADS) framework was developed by the American College of Radiology (ACR), aiming to standardize the radiology reports. Hence, validation and further modification of the proposed COVID-RADS grading system require the support of professional societies.",
