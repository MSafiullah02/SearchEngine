Methods: The clinical and laboratory data of 383 patients with the definite outcome by March 1, 2020 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan were reviewed. The association between platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: Among the 383 patients, 334 (87.2%) were discharged and survived, and 49 (12.8%) died. Thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality of almost three times as high as that for those without thrombocytopenia (P < 0.05). Cox regression analyses revealed that platelet count was an independent risk factor associated with in-hospital mortality in a dose-dependent manner. An increment of per 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L in platelets was associated with a 40% decrease in mortality (hazard ratio: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.84). Dynamic changes of platelets were also closely related to death during hospitalization. Conclusions: Baseline platelet levels and changes were associated with subsequent mortality.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection has a wide clinical spectrum, including asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory disease, and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure and even death. Hematological changes, including lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients with COVID-19 similar to SARS in 2003 [6, 7] . Abnormal coagulation is a common complication of COVID-19 and is manifested by pulmonary vascular leakage, intravascular thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thrombocytopenia is also a common clinical manifestation associated with poor outcome in patients with communityacquired pneumonia [8] . Platelets not only contribute to hemostasis, but also participate in inflammation and host defense response. The latter is especially important when the lungs are infected. Although many cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients with severe viral pneumonia and thus is a suggestive clinical characteristic of COVID-19, the association of baseline platelets and changes with adverse COVID-19 outcome remains unclear.",

Demographic characteristics (gender and age), comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease), clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes (discharge/ death) were extracted from electronic medical records. Laboratory data, including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, fibrinogen, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and arterial blood gases (lactate and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), were collected at admission. Additional platelet parameters, including plateletcrit (PCT, %), mean platelet volume (MPV, fL), platelet distribution width (%), and platelet larger cell ratio (P-LCR, %) were also gathered. According to the test projectmanual and reagent instructions of the Central Hospital of Wuhan, the normal reference interval of platelet count was 125-350 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Therefore, thrombocytopenia was defined as a blood platelet <125 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and non-thrombocytopenia was defined as a blood platelet >125 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment, and CURB-65 criteria were determined within 24 h after admission. Data on all treatment measures, including antibiotic, antivirus, glucocorticoid, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and respiratory support, were acquired during hospitalization. Throat swab samples were collected from all suspected patients at admission, and the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol (Beijing Genomics Institution and Geneodx biotechnology Co., Ltd.). Repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in confirmed patients to verify viral clearance before hospital discharge.",

The association between baseline platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models in terms of the following confounders: age, sex, baseline comorbidities (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease). Glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin might affect the hematopoietic system, and these treatments are common in clinical practice. In addition, decreased lymphocyte count represents the progression of the disease, C-reactive protein represents the overall inflammation, and augment blood lactate represents acute lung injury, tissue hypoxia and/or oxygen debt and associated mortality critical patients [10] . Therefore, we also considered these in regression models. Smoothing spline presenting the association of baseline platelet levels and platelets change with subsequent mortality was generated by utilizing the generalized additive model. Survival curve was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and examined using the log-rank test. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (The R Foundation, http://www.r-project.org, version 3.6.1) and EmpowerStats (http:// www.empowerstats.com, X&Y Solutions, Inc., Boston, MA) unless otherwise indicated.

No significant differences in comorbidities were observed between patients with thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia at admission were likely older and had a higher APACHE II score than those with non-thrombocytopenia. Most patients were administered with antibiotics, and some were treated with ribavirin (88.3%), oseltamivir (25.6%), and arbidol (20.9%). Empiric systemic glucocorticoid therapy (58.2%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (56.1%) were used for anti-inflammatory treatment. Noninvasive ventilation was used on 51 patients (13.3%). The thrombocytopenia group had a higher proportion of noninvasive ventilation therapy (26.5% vs. 10.5%) and mortality rate (30.9% vs. 8.9%) than those without thrombocytopenia. The dynamic changes in platelet count from day 1 to day 14 after the onset of the disease were tracked to determine the major clinical features observed during COVID-19 progression.

Decreased levels of PaO 2 :FIO 2 were observed in the thrombocytopenia group compared with those in the non-thrombocytopenia group. Analysis of platelet parameters revealed that patients with thrombocytopenia had lower levels of platelets and PCT and higher levels of MPV and P-LCR than those without thrombocytopenia.",

We observed the mortality decreased with elevating platelet count, and the curve gradually tends to be gentle when platelet count >200 \u00d7 10 9 /L (Figure 3a ). Continuous tracking of the changes in platelets within the first 7 days after admission revealed that when platelets increased, the risk of death decreased during the treatment and vice-versa ( Figure  3b ).

            "text": "Patients with COVID-19 usually have a rapid progression of pneumonitis and even develop ARDS and death. Among the 383 COVID-19 patients enrolled, most were admitted with platelets in the normal range, and a few had thrombocytopenia. Although the majority of current studies revealed a decreased number of platelets in groups with severe COVID-19 [6, 7] , no research has investigated the dynamic changes of platelets and estimated the association of baseline platelets and platelets change with subsequent mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without thrombocytopenia. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to adjust for several death-related risk factors at admission. Our study highlights the following: (a) thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality that is almost three times higher than that in patients without thrombocytopenia; (b) platelet count was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 mortality; and (c) the dynamic changes of platelets were closely related to death during treatment. Our study highlights that platelet monitoring might be important for COVID-19 prognosis. Data are presented as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals. P trend was estimated using the median value of each quartile. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and baseline comorbidities (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease); Model 2 adjusted for model 1, plus glucocorticoid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, blood lactate, C-reactive protein, and lymphocyte count Enhanced platelet activation leading to platelet deposition in damaged pulmonary blood vessels has been supported by various clinical studies, and thrombocytopenia is an important feature of SARS [11, 12] . Thrombocytopenia has exceeded 50% incidence rate in patients with SARS and is an important indicator of poor prognosis [13] [14] [15] . A meta-analysis with 1779 COVID-19 patients reported that thrombocytopenia was associated with threefold-enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 and an lower platelet count was observed with mortality [16] . Similar to this study, the current work confirmed that thrombocytopenia at admission is associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Platelets in patients with SARS are negatively correlated with their sVCAM-1 levels. sVCAM-1 is involved in adhesion and chemotaxis and contributes to early vascular injury and suppression of T cell function. Vascular injury or immunosuppression may explain the poor outcome [17] . By using the Cox regression model for multivariate analysis, we found that platelets and PCT are independent risk factors that predict death. Although platelets were routinely measured daily, the role of platelets and PCT in predicting the outcome of patients with COVID-19 has not been previously reported, and the correlation between platelet dynamics and disease prognosis has not been studied. Different platelet thresholds have been used in epidemiological studies for the incidence, risk factors, and consequences of thrombocytopenia among critically ill patients [18, 19] . In our cohort, a nonlinear relationship between platelets at admission and mortality was observed, and the trend tends to be gentle when platelet count >200 \u00d7 10 9 /L (Figure 3a ). Further analysis showed that patients with a platelet level <200 \u00d7 10 9 /L at admission and decrease in 7 days had the highest mortality rate, whereas those with a platelet level >200 \u00d7 10 9 /L at admission and increase in 7 days had the lowest mortality rate. Moreover, thrombocytopenia had a close relationship with prognosis even within the normal reference range. The dynamic changes of platelets within the first 7 days after admission were negatively correlated with the prognosis. Cox proportional hazards regression models displayed a 40% decrease in mortality risk for every 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L increase in platelets. In summary, platelet count is an important prognostic marker for patients with COVID-19, and the dynamic levels of platelets during treatment are closely associated with death. PCT was calculated from platelet count, and its levels at admission still retained a detrimental effect on clinical outcome [20] .",

Inflammation and long-term oxygen treatment also result in extensive alveolar damage and other pulmonary pathological changes. The pulmonary capillary bed is morphologically altered, thus further affecting the lung megakaryocyte fragmentation and megakaryocytopoiesis. The increased consumption and decreased production of platelet may affect thrombocytopenia. Similar to SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 thrombocytopenia may involve other mechanisms. This new condition may directly infect hematopoietic precursor cells and inhibit their growth. CD 13 and CD66a are expressed on human bone marrow CD34 + cells. SARS-CoV-2 may induce growth inhibition by binding to the CD13 or CD66a of hematopoietic cells and bone marrow stromal cells, resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis and immunodeficiency [21] . The body undergoes immune-mediated hematopoietic stem cell damage, thereby further leading to thrombocytopenia. This study is subjected to several limitations. First, as an observational study, we cannot conclude that the reported associations between platelet parameters and mortality are causal. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility of remaining residual confounding or unmeasured potential confounders. Third, the pathological mechanism of platelet parameters in the progression of COVID-19 remains poorly defined, and further clinical and basic research are necessary to clarify this issue. Although this study is the first to identify the association between platelet parameters and mortality risk in patients with COVID-19, a large-scale and multi-center study is warranted to confirm these findings.",
