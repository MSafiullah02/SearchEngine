Of these, about one quarter develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mortality is estimated at 60\u201390%. Despite the current detailed understanding of the pathology of sepsis, there are still few effective strategies against this condition [2], [3]. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that an inhibition of blood coagulation is beneficial [4], [5]. In addition to neutrophils and macrophages, an interaction between platelets and pulmonary endothelial cells may be involved in ARDS [6]. Platelets also play an important role in the development of multiple organ failure in sepsis [7].",

At lower doses of LPS, these platelets soon return to the circulation, but at higher doses they are broken down, with their large-scale breakdown inducing lethal shock [9], [10]. This response (the magnitude of which depends on the strain of mouse, the structure of the LPS, and its dose) is induced via an activation of the complement system [9], [10]. Thus, the rapid shock induced by LPS differs from the well-known \u201cendotoxin shock\u201d seen in mice in that in the latter type, shock signs appear 2\u20133 h or more later, with death occurring several hours or more later [11]. It is thought that LPS is involved as a mediator in several of the signs seen in sepsis (including shock) and that various inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF and IL-1) are also involved in mediating these signs [12], [13], [14].",

They also have anti-inflammatory activities via suppressions of prostaglandin production [18], histamine release [19], and histamine synthesis [20], [21]. In addition, GL and/or GA inhibit the complement system [22], [23]. In Japan, GL is given to chronic hepatitis C patients by daily slow intravenous infusions over a long period [24], [25].

LPS from the Klebsiella O3 strain LEN-1 (S type) was prepared by the phenol-water method [26], dissolved in sterile saline (0.1 or 0.5 mg/ml), then injected (i.v.) via the tail vein (0.1 ml/10 g body weight). A monoclonal anti-mouse platelet antibody, Pm-1, was kindly provided by Dr. T. Nagasawa (Division of Hematology, University of Tsukuba, Japan) [27]. Although the molecular antigen for Pm-1 has not been identified, Pm-1 has been shown to deplete platelets in mice [28]. Control IgG was prepared from normal mouse serum by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, followed by dialysis of the precipitant. Glycyron Injection (Minophagen Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) (a 26.5 mg/ml solution of ammonium glycyrrhizinate, equivalent to 20 mg/ml of GL) was diluted with saline, then injected intravenously (i.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (0.1 ml/10 g body weight). GA (Tokyo Kasei, Tokyo, Japan) was suspended in 1% carboxymethyl cellulose and given into the stomach through a syringe (0.1 ml/10 g body weight). Aspirin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in saline by adding 1 M NaOH, with the pH of the solution being adjusted to 7 with 1 M HCl. Dexamethasone (Sigma) was dissolved in saline. Before the experiment, mice were moved to a room with a temperature of 26\u201328 \u00b0C, and kept there for 1 h after injection of LPS, because the rapid platelet responses to LPS are reduced at room temperatures lower than that (unpublished data). In experiments intended to last a long time, mice were returned to a normal animal room (23\u00b11 \u00b0C) at 1 h after the LPS injection. All procedures complied with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in Tohoku University.",

After reweighing, the platelets were destroyed by sonication, and each tube was cooled in an ice bath. Lungs were rapidly removed and kept in a jar containing dry ice until needed. The determination of the 5HT level in the blood was carried out soon after the blood was collected, whereas the 5HT levels in the lung were determined within 2 days of collection. After 5HT had been separated by column chromatography, it was measured fluorometrically as previously described [29].

However, the results suggest that they may also play an important role in helping the animal to resist the delayed lethality induced by LPS, the so-called \u201cendotoxin shock\u201d. Our results demonstrate that GL is effective at suppressing not only the rapid shock induced by LPS, but also the delayed \u201cendotoxin shock\u201d. In experimental models like that employed in the present study, we can distinguish between these rapid and delayed types of shock, because the LPS is given to animals by a single injection. In human patients, however, the level of endotoxin may increase progressively with the increase in bacterial numbers, and the pathology of Gram-negative sepsis may also develop progressively. Therefore, when the two types of shock occur in the same patient, distinguishing between them will be difficult. We speculate that infection with Gram-negative bacteria (or with LPS derived from them) may stimulate mechanisms leading to both types of shock. In the present study, we directed our attention mainly toward the rapid platelet responses to LPS and the associated rapid shock.",

            "text": "We earlier proposed that the lectin pathway that forms C3 convertase from C4 and C2 may be involved in the LPS-induced accumulation of platelets in the lung, while the pathway from C5 to C9 is involved in the subsequent platelet destruction and rapid shock [9], [10]. Interestingly, Kroes et al. [22] reported that both GL and GA inhibit human complement C2 in vitro, while Fujisawa et al. [23] found that GL inhibits human C5 or a later stage of the complement cascade in vitro. These effects are seen at 0.05\u20130.5 \u03bcmol/ml (about 0.05\u20130.5 mg/ml) of GL (this level of GL might have been attained in the blood in our in vivo experiment, as described below). In the present study, GL inhibited the LPS-induced accumulation of platelets in the lung. In addition, in GL-treated mice the platelet count in the blood had returned almost to its initial level at 10 min after the LPS injection, and the severity of the shock was markedly reduced. These results suggest that GL may inhibit both the early and later stages of the lectin pathway, although other anti-inflammatory effects of GL might also be involved. Interestingly, GL has recently been shown to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation both in vitro [32] and in vivo models of thrombosis in rats [33]. The dose- and time-dependent effects of GL on in vivo thrombosis that were observed in the latter study were very similar to those seen in the present study. The complement system is composed of several serine proteases [34], [35]. Upon recognition of pathogens, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins trigger the activation of the lectin pathway through MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) [35]. We have shown that activation of the lectin pathway is involved in the LPS-induced activation of platelets [9], [10]. MASP-1 has thrombin-like activity [36] and thrombin is also a serine protease. Thus, it is likely that GL might exhibit its inhibitory action on the lectin pathway through its inhibitory effect on serine proteases. It should also be noted that many in vivo platelet responses are considered to be mediated, directly or indirectly, by activated complements, and the terminal complement proteins have been suggested to generate thrombin [37]. In any event, we need to clarify the mechanism (possibly involving other anti-inflammatory effects of GL) by which GL suppresses the rapid platelet responses to LPS as well as the delayed lethality induced by LPS.",

Indeed, lower doses of GL (40 and 80 mg/kg) were effective when injected (i.v.) simultaneously with LPS. These lower doses are equivalent to about 0.5\u20131 mg/ml in the blood (since the average mouse body weight is about 25 g and its blood volume about 2 ml). In chronic hepatitis C patients, GL is slowly infused intravenously at 2\u20134 mg/kg/day for a long period [24], [25], which would yield a concentration in the blood of about 0.025\u20130.05 mg/ml. Compared to this human dose, our murine doses seem to be very high. However, it should be noted that pharmacokinetic profiles differ greatly between mice and humans. This difference may be partly due to the difference in their heart rates: 50\u201370 and 400\u2013600 beats/min in humans and mice, respectively [38]. Thus, the blood concentration of drugs may decrease more rapidly in mice than in humans, which means that larger doses are needed in the former than in the latter. For example, in various murine inflammation models aspirin and dexamethasone are given intraperitoneally at about 50\u2013150 and 0.2\u20135 mg/kg, respectively, while in humans the single oral doses of these drugs are roughly 10\u201320 and 0.01\u20130.05 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, more than 80% of GL is cleared from the blood within 10 min of its intravenous bolus injection into mice [39], while the initial half-life of GL in the blood is roughly 1 h in humans [40]. In view of the information about in vitro concentrations given above, the slow intravenous infusion of GL typically used in humans might be expected to provide an effective blood concentration for the suppression or prevention of the platelet responses to LPS in human patients infected with Gram-negative bacteria.",

In addition, it should be noted that glucocorticoids strongly suppress immune responses. In contrast, the side effects of GL are few and can be controlled, and it has been suggested that GL enhances cell-mediated immunity by enhancing the production of Th1 cytokines such as interferon [45] or interleukin-12 [46], [47]. Incidentally, recent studies have demonstrated that histamine suppresses Th1 responses, but enhances Th2 responses [48], [49].

Infusion of Streptococcus sanguis into rabbits has been shown to induce a marked accumulation of platelets in the lung [54].

[57] proposed that GL may be an effective drug against SARS. The present results, including the finding that GL is effective at suppressing so-called \u201cendotoxin shock\u201d, seem to support this proposal.",
