The Hong Kong Flu of 1968 had been the most recent pandemic until the H1N1 pandemic was realized in the spring of 2009 with the appearance of the swine flu (H1N1).(1,\n2) On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to 6, which indicated the onset of a pandemic. As of June 8, 2009, WHO reported almost 30,000 confirmed cases of H1N1 and 145 deaths worldwide.(3) More than 13,000 cases and 27 deaths were reported in the United States alone.(3) WHO's December 2009 update(4) reported H1N1 infections in more than 209 countries and attributed over 12,220 deaths to H1N1 infections. Although this outbreak did not have the virulence of earlier pandemics, it was sufficiently similar to previous pandemics to merit concern. It is not certain that the current H1N1 strain will mutate into a more virulent form, but health care workers are taking the possibility very seriously.",

Eleven peaks appeared following chemical disinfection, and nine were observed following UV disinfection. All appear to be species related to the solvent (n-pentane) and unrelated to the disinfectant. Several more are identified as siloxanes, common artifacts bled from GC columns. The GC also detected ubiquitous contaminants, including butyl phthalate and bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, which are used in the manufacture of polymeric materials. These were included in the results to show completeness, but it is important to note that, like the other analytes, they are presumed to be unrelated to the decontamination technologies.",

The peaks that are due to column bleed are inherently random, although they consistently increase in concentration as the oven temperature increases. As the study progressed, GC maintenance included progressively trimming several feet from the front end of the capillary column. We have tried to account for shifts in retention time caused by this procedure but might not have precisely tracked all of the peaks through the entire course of the study.",

Diacetone alcohol is a Class II combustible liquid with both REL and PEL of 50 ppm (240 mg/m3)(29) that is presumed to have formed by aldol condensation of acetone introduced incidentally as part of the process of preparation and treatment.
