We found that the methylation levels of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 were significantly decreased in the acute stage of KD patients compared to the healthy and febrile controls ( Figure 4 ). However, after IVIG administration, the methylation status of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 was significantly elevated in KD patients ( Figure 5 ). Since lower methylation leads to greater gene expression [15] , we focused on the correlation between DNA methylation patterns and gene expressions. As shown in Figure 5 , TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 demonstrate a hypo-methylated status in KD patients prior to undergoing IVIG treatment compared with the control subjects and the KD patients after undergoing IVIG treatment. Therefore, the mRNA expression level and DNA methylation of these TLRs demonstrate negative correlations. To ensure un-biased results, we performed 10,000 re-samplings [16] for each TLR to extract pairs of gene intensity and CpG marker \u03b2 values in each group. Therefore, we collected 40,000 pairs of gene intensity and CpG marker \u03b2 values from the four groups. Figure 6 demonstrates that gene expression level and CpG marker methylation were significantly negatively correlated (p < 0.001 for all TRLs), thus indicating that DNA methylation represses gene expression.",

More importantly, the mRNA levels of TLR1, 4, 5, and 8 were significantly elevated in KD patients compared to both the healthy and febrile controls. We also observed that treating KD patients Oncotarget 11251 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget with IVIG could significantly decrease these TLRs' mRNA expression. In KD patients before undergoing IVIG treatment, TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 demonstrate a hypo-methylated status compared to the control subjects and KD patients after IVIG treatment. In contrast, the mRNA expression level and DNA methylation of these TLRs demonstrate an opposite reverse tendency between the two stages of KD samples and both controls.",

Similarly, HMGB1 has been shown not only to amplify inflammation but also to increase vascular inflammation in various vasculitis diseases [24] . The receptors involved in HMGB1 signal transduction are TLR2 and TLR4 [25] , which is consistent with our findings that both TLR2 and TLR4 increased in KD patients and then decreased after IVIG treatment. Moreover, TLR4 dependent macrophage signaling is associated with coronary arterial disease [26] . Lipopolysaccharide, a TLR4 agonist, has been shown to drive hepcidin expression [27] . Hepcidin is triggered during infections and inflammation [28] . In a previous study, we were the first to show that Figure 6 : Correlation analysis of gene expression and CpG marker methylation. The CpG markers corresponding to TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are cg22839308, cg03523945, cg13730105, cg14578677, cg07759587, and cg21578541, respectively. We used scatter plots to demonstrate correlations between mRNA levels and DNA methylation. The results demonstrated that mRNA levels were negatively correlated with DNA methylation (Pearson's correlation coefficient around \u22120.4 and p < 0.001). www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget hepcidin induces transient anemia and hypoferremia in the acute inflammatory phase of KD [29] . Furthermore, TLR6 functionally produces heterodimer with TLR2 to facilitate intracellular response to bacterial lipoprotein [30] , while TLR9 appears to respond to unmethylated CpG of bacterial DNA [8] . Our results showed remarkable activation of TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9, which correlates with bacteriarelated pathogen-associated molecular patterns, except for activation of TLR3 and 7, which relates to doublestranded RNA and single-stranded viral RNA in the acute stage of KD. These results support the evidence that KD is a bacterium-like inflammatory disease. During the past 50 years, since Dr. Kawasaki's first report in 1967, many studies have attempted to identify a definitive infectious agent that causes KD but have not succeeded. However, certain superantigens from bacteria and intracellular pathogens have been implicated in KD. Various bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, have been isolated in KD patients [31, 32] . On the other hand, Chang et al. reported that common respiratory viruses, such as coronaviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses, were associated with KD [33] . Stating for certain whether KD is the result of a bacterial infection or a viral infection is still not possible. Taken together, KD is not a purely infectious disease with a cause-effect relationship with any pathogens but can occur in hosts with certain genetic backgrounds.",

Then we measured the collected RNA samples with Bioanalyzer (ABI) and Qubit (Thermo) to determine RNA quality (RIN value) and quantity. All RNA samples passed the criterion of RIN \u2265 7. The DNA samples were isolated and treated with bisulfite as described in a previous study [37] .",

The RNA samples were prepared using the WT PLUS Reagent kit, followed by hybridization on HTA 2.0 microarray chips. In accordance with Affymetrix manuals, the raw data of the HTA 2.0 chips underwent quality control examination. The chips that passed the quality control criteria were analyzed with Partek (Partek, St. Louis), a commercial software specifically for microarray data analysis. Using Partek, we conducted ANOVA analysis and reported the p-values of the comparisons of interest.",

More information about M450 BeadChip can be found at http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/infinium_ humanmethylation450_beadchip_kit.html. For each M450K BeadChip assay, 200 ng of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA was applied in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
