As such, lectins have demonstrated potential for use in histologic studies to stain certain tissue types (Boerwinkel et al., 2014), or diagnostics in biosensors (Belicky et al., 2016) as well as helping to understand and modulate cellular processes including host defense from infectious agents.",

The evolutionary development of viral glycosylation as a mechanism to both enhance viral uptake and evade host organism defenses has resulted in a co-evolution of lectins specific to non-self carbohydrate structures. The glycosylation of viral envelope glycoproteins is sequence driven, requiring spontaneous mutation and loss of oligosaccharide-attachment sites to avoid lectin recognition (Fig. 1) (Balzarini et al., 2004a). Such depletion of the glycocalyx surrounding envelope glycoproteins can have deleterious effects on viral fitness (Kolchinsky et al., 2001). The continuing challenges in enabling broad spectrum viral suppression support the study of lectins as viral entry inhibitors to provide prophylactic and potentially therapeutic agents against viral infections.",

The envelope proteins share sequence homology across enveloped viruses, adopt similar tertiary and quaternary structure, and perform equivalent functions (Fig. 2\nB) (Pancera et al, 2014, Kirchdoerfer et al, 2016, Zhao et al, 2016). Using HIV as an example, the Env protein complex is composed of a transmembrane trimer of gp41 and extracellular trimer of gp120 (Fig. 2A) (Pinter et al, 1989, Earl et al., 1990). Each of these envelope proteins contain N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites (defined by the consensus amino acid sequence \u2013NXS/T-) which, when glycosylated, assist in viral evasion of the host immune system (Fig. 1, Fig. 2C) (Stewart-Jones et al., 2016). The Env protein complex mediates attachment to and entry into target cells first through recognition of CD4+ initiating a cascade of conformation reorganization of the Env protein complex that ultimately leads to the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cellular membrane and infection (Fig. 2D) (Jones et al., 1998, Davenport et al., 2015). Lectins are considered HIV entry inhibitors as they interact with the glycosylation moieties of the Env protein complex preventing the conformational rearrangements required for viral fusion (Barrientos et al., 2006).",

The duplication of binding domains provides a mechanism for increased avidity for branched carbohydrate structures. The sequence identity of lectins ranges from \u223c10 to 100% across genera with the greatest variability localized to the loop regions that contribute to the CRD for some classes. Sequence homology is found predominantly in the core structural components of the lectin. Disulfide bonds are present in some antiviral lectin structures, but are not a prerequisite. Specifically, CV-N, SVN, and AH contain disulfide bonds that are within single domains and/or between domains. The lectins are also known to oligomerize, although it is also not a prerequisite. Some lectins form dimers, trimers or tetramers in solution, while others are seen as monomers (OAA, SVN, AH, and PCL) (Table 2, Table 4, Table 6\n). Finally, certain members of the lectins discussed herein utilize strand exchange and domain swapping to stabilize the oligomeric state such as the C-terminal strand exchange seen in the \u03b2-prism type I and II folds and domain swap as seen in CV-N.",

The structural orientation of the individual CRDs in lectins can then add increased levels of affinity for particular high-order sugar structures such as select oligosaccharides. Specifically, some antiviral lectins interact only with the high mannose oligosaccharide components Man-9, Man-7 and Man-4, some with entire glycan branches (D1, D2, or D3), and some interact with the core galactose containing chitobiose unit as well as D1 or D3 branches (Fig. 1, Fig. 3; Table 2, Table 4, Table 6).

The Jacalin-like antiviral lectins utilize a trio of aromatic residues that provide the interior walls of the CRDs and in some instances the side chains of tyrosine and tryptophan may participate in direct interactions with the oligosaccharide. The lectins belonging to the OAAH family have a conserved consensus CRD sequence with residue side chains and backbone that participate in hydrogen bonding with the glycans. Analysis of the frequency of residues that participate in direct interactions with the oligosaccharides, either through back bone or side chain hydrogen bonding, reveals that aspartate and glutamate are most prevalent at 16.66% and 14.29%, respectively (Fig. 4\n). This is consistent with the types of lectin:glycan interactions identified through NMR titration and x-ray co-crystallization experiments. The less prevalent hydrophobic residues provide hydrogen bonding interactions specifically through backbone amide and carbonyl oxygen.",

The 114 residue protein has a molecular weight of \u223c12.5 kDa and contains 3 CRDs defined by internal repeats: R1 1\u201338, R2 39\u201377, and R3 78\u2013114. AH is unusual among anti-HIV lectins in that it has a basic isoelectric point of 8.3. The protein is expressed as a proprotein with an N-terminal signal peptide that is subsequently cleaved revealing the mature 114 residue lectin. The lectin is active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 with IC50 values of 2\u2013110 nM in the MAGI assay and inhibited cell-cell fusion with EC50 values ranging from 60 to 700 nM (Chiba et al., 2004). The x-ray crystal structures of AH reveal that the protein is organized into a Ricin B-chain-like \u03b2-trefoil with \u03b11,2-mannotriose bound in each CRD located between the second and third \u03b2 strands of the carbohydrate binding site (Zhang et al., 2014). Specifically, the side chains of D15, Y23, and N28 hydrogen bond with O3 and O4 of M2 of the trimannose ligand. The other sugar monomers are involved in secondary interactions mediated through water bridges and the binding interactions are conserved in all three CRDs. AH showed tight, specific binding to glycosylated gp120 (Kd = 5.3\u201323 nM), but no significant interaction with CD4 or co-receptors (Hoorelbeke et al., 2010). AH is thought to inhibit viral entry through binding to high-mannose oligosaccharides on gp120 with specificities similar to that of CV-N with no reported mitogenicity (Hoorelbeke et al, 2010, Matoba et al, 2010). Resistance studies revealed that HIV that became resistant to AH contained mutations that removed a mixture of 12 different N-glycosylation sites including 7 that typically bear high mannose oligosaccharides with up to 5 N-glycan deletion mutations necessary for a 20-fold reduction in AH potency (Hoorelbeke et al., 2010).",

MVN was not active against clinical isolate group O in PBMC (>350 nM) or HIV-2 (>330 nM) at the tested concentrations. The development of HIV-1: MVN-resistance was explored with the NL4.3 virus in MT-4 cells at dilute concentrations of MVN revealing 4 mutations in gp120 of the resistant strain (residues T294, T341, N386, and N392) (Huskens et al., 2010). The lectin specifically binds to oligosaccharides of viral envelope glycoproteins with preference for high-mannose glycans containing terminal \u03b1(1,2)-mannose disaccharides and the highest signals reported for Man (9), the D1 arm of Man (9), and the D3 arm of Man (9) as determined from a carbohydrate microarray (Kehr et al., 2006). MVN inhibits syncytium formation as well as DC-SIGN-mediated viral binding to CD4+ cells (Huskens et al., 2010). Even though MVN displayed a less pronounced mitogenic response when compared to CV-N in freshly isolated PBMCs from two separate donors, significant stimulatory effects on the production of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 were observed (Huskens et al., 2010). The protein also inhibited syncytium formation in HIV-1 infected HUT-78 T cells and uninfected CD4+ SupT1 cells and, like CV-N, prevented the binding of the anti-HIV mAb 2G12 high-mannose gp120 (albeit at 10 fold lower inhibition) (Bewley, 2001). MVN acts synergistically with both 2G12 and CV-N (Shahzad-ul-Hussan et al., 2011). These results support that microvirin is a broad HIV-1 entry inhibitor effective against many co-receptor types as well as the lab clinical isolate group M HIV-1 in PBMC.",

The apo and holo crystal structures (PDBID: 1ZHS and 1ZHQ) revealed a 2 domain organization where each domain contains a distorted 3-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet that wraps around a 15 residue \u03b1-helix effectively forming a cleft at the distal end of the domain (Williams et al., 2005). The lectin forms a dimer in crystal and solution with extensive interactions burying \u223c3900 \u00c52 of solvent accessible surface. Each monomer interacts with both N- and C-terminal domains in the dimer. This domain organization results in a cleft that contains the CRD, which accommodates pentasaccharides through direct interactions with 4 sugar monomers.",

The IC50 of SVN for ZEBOV and MARV was 41 and 260 nM, respectively. The injected SVN was bioavailable in BALB/c mice showing marked decreases in baseline levels within 4 h of injection, thus requiring the 4 injections per day to maintain effective antiviral serum concentrations, which greatly complicated BSL-4 containment efficacy studies. The survival rate past 20 days was 70\u201390% for SVN treatments \u22121 h, +1 h, and +1 day after viral challenge indicating the efficacy of systemic treatment in a mammalian system. Despite the short half-life of injected SVN, the potency against a range of sensitive viruses and the absence of reported cytotoxicities earns this particular antiviral lectin a high potential therapeutic status. Though SVN displayed good efficacy in protecting mice against ZEBOV, the challenges associated with its short half-life make further development of this agent dependent on modifications of the protein which could extend its serum half-life (i.e PEGylation-modification with polyethylene glycol).",

            "text": "The lectin, Jacalin, was isolated from jackfruit seeds (Artocarpus integrifolia) (Roque-Barreira and Campos-Neto, 1985). The lectin exists as a homotetramer in solution with a monomeric molecular weight of 16.5 kDa. The most important contribution of this lectin to the antiviral lectins discussed in this review is the wealth of structural information published to date (Bourne et al, 2002, Sankaranarayanan et al, 1996, Jeyaprakash et al, 2003). Twelve PDB entries represent some of the first structures that described the type I \u03b2-prism fold, commonly referred to as the Jacalin-like lectin fold. The type I \u03b2-prism fold has three-fold symmetry with each domain comprised of a four-stranded Greek key motif. The protein is post-translationally modified through proteolytic cleavage of the first 18 residues in the N-terminus resulting in the heavy \u03b1 Jacalin chain and the light 18 residue peptide \u03b2 chain. In the 1JAC crystal structure, Gly1 of the \u03b1-chain forms a portion of the CRD with G1 carbonyl H-bonding with the O3 and O4 hydroxyls of methyl-\u03b1-galactose (Sankaranarayanan et al., 1996). The CRD is largely comprised of hydrophobic aromatic residues: F47, Y78, Y122, and W123 exhibiting hydrogen bonding interactions between galactose and Y122, W123, and G1 amides and D125 carboxylate.",

Jacalin is distinct from the other antiviral lectins discussed in this review in that the mechanism of action most likely derives not from the interaction of lectin and glycoprotein gp120, but rather the interaction with glycans that decorate CD4 on the host cell surface (Favero et al, 1993, Corbeau et al, 1994, Corbeau et al., 1995). It was initially thought that Jacalin specifically bound Gal\u03b2(1,3)GalNAc, but subsequent SPR and crystallographic studies revealed that Jacalin is promiscuous in saccharide binding with a CRD that accommodates GalNAc, GlcNAc, Neu5Ac, MurNAc, and 1-O-methyl derivatives of glucose, mannose, and galactose (albeit at a much higher concentration) (Bourne et al, 2002, Corbeau et al, 1994, Corbeau et al., 1995). Furthermore, a 14 residue peptide derived from Jacalin is homologous with a portion of gp120 sequence exhibiting mild inhibitory effects on HIV (at \u223c318 \u03bcM) (Favero et al., 1993). Jacalin is the only lectin discussed in this review that is thought to have a preference of CD4 glycans over gp120.",

            "text": "Because the lectin exhibited a strong T-cell mitogenic response, research was conducted to mutate the protein to reduce mitogenicity while preserving the virucidal activity (Swanson et al., 2015). In effect, the mutation H84T resulted in a substantial decrease in mitogencity while maintaining the antiviral effects (Swanson et al., 2015). Interestingly, the mutation is positioned near the CRD yet had little effect on the virucidal activity and did not substantially alter the mannose poses in crystallo (4PIT). Alignment of the WT and H84T BanLec structures results in a root-mean-squared deviation of 0.442 \u00c5 over 138 C-\u03b1 positions with only slight perturbations in the backbone for residue 84 indicating strong structural conservation for the remaining protein backbone (Fig. 5). The repositioned loop results in residue 84 C-\u03b1 1.4 \u00c5 closer and C-\u03b2 2.1 \u00c5 closer to the CRD in the mutant structure allowing an additional hydrogen bond between 84T and dimannose hydroxyl. This methodology, which reduces mitogenicity and retains structural integrity, provides a route for the potential development of antiviral lectin-based therapeutics. Due to the potency against HIV and the low mitogenicity of the recombinant H84T mutant, BanLec is of potential therapeutic importance with respect to many of the antiviral lectins discussed in this review.",

Research efforts to generate monomeric forms of GRFT (mGRFT) resulted in decrease in antiviral potency (up to 323 nM) suggesting the oligomeric state and distance between CRDs strongly influence virucidal activity (Fig. 6) (Moulaei et al., 2010). The monomeric form of the lectin does not participate in the domain swap of the first two \u03b2-strands and was engineered through the insertion of Gly-Ser at position 17 localized to the random coil between strand 1 and 2 (Fig. 6). Engineering of tandemeric mGRFT with 2, 3, and 4 mGRFT linked with variable length linkers resulted in 3mGRFT and 4mGRFT with anti-HIV activities with an EC50 of 1 and 1.2 pM, respectively (Moulaei et al., 2015). Examination of anti-HIV activities against various subtype A, B, and C strains with the mGRFT tandemers revealed better global anti-HIV activities with median IC50 values of 0.396, 0.298, and 0.181 nM, respectively as compared to both mGRFT and wtGRFT. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry binding studies revealed the 2mGRFT3 and 3mGRFT tandemers bind glycosylated gp120 (from HIV-1) with 3 nM affinity, which was slightly better than GRFT and almost 2 orders of magnitude better than mGRFT alone. The tandemeric 3mGRFT represents the most potent antiviral lectin discussed herein with in vivo characterization that makes it an outstanding candidate for clinical use as topical microbicide and s.c. therapeutic.",

The lectin consists of 109 residues with a monomeric molecular weight of 12 kDa and in solution was reported to form dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric oligomers with crystallographic and SAXS structures, while size-exclusion experiments supported the tetrameric assembly (Sauerborn et al., 1999). NPL monomers have 3 CRD (and a fourth, low affinity CRD) and adopt the monocot consensus fold with residues 102\u2013109 participating in strand exchange [same ref as above]. Mannose binds the CRD of NPL through interaction with the side chains of Q26, D28, N30, and Y34, which are conserved across the three CRDs. The lectin is reported to have anti-HIV-1 and 2 and anti-SIV activities with EC50s 0.7\u20137.3 \u03bcg/ml (\u223c50\u2013500 nM) and, to a lesser extent, anti-HSV, anti-Rabies, and anti-Rubella activity with MIC50s of 11, 8.2, and 2.9 \u03bcM, respectively (Marchetti et al, 1995, Balzarini et al, 1991, Weiler et al, 1990).

Finally, CGL was reported as having low anticancer activity against breast cancer (MCF7) in a MTT assay >200 \u03bcg/mL (Liao et al., 2016).

As proteins, it is assumed that lectins will not be able to be orally administered as they would not survive digestive enzymes. Few studies have assessed the systemic bioavailability of lectins. Two lectins that have been assessed are CV-N and GRFT. CV-N was found to be biologically available following subcutaneous injection into mice (Barrientos et al., 2003) with dosing up to 5.6 mg/kg/day tolerated. The bioavailability of CV-N was assessed in the context of studies evaluating its systemic efficacy against Ebola Zaire (EBOZ) where CV-N was shown to delay the mean time to death for treated animals by several days. As the animals were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with EBOZ, the combined results indicated that CV-N was bioavailable and retained activity following subcutaneous injection.",

Most of the viruses for which these lectins have been put forward as potential clinical agents are either emerging infectious agents such as Ebola, SARS CoV, and Japanese encephalitis or as microbicidal agents acting against sexually transmitted viruses such as HIV and HSV. The economic realities of these particular utilities require that these antiviral proteins be produced at a reasonable cost. When one considers that the societies most impacted by the current HIV epidemic are predominantly those with minimal health resources for their patient population the need for low cost production strategies is clear. To address this need, proteins such as GRFT and CV-N have been produced in genetically engineered plants including tobacco (O'Keefe et al., 2009, Sexton et al, 2006), soy (O'Keefe et al., 2015) and rice (Vamvaka et al., 2016a, Vamvaka et al., 2016b).

The structural information now available for these proteins has enabled rational design of mutant proteins with improved capabilities. In some cases this has been the design of more potent analogs as demonstrated by GRFT tandemers, which were engineered to allow more conformational freedom between CRDs and resulted in a 5\u201310 fold improvement in anti-HIV activity and enhanced activity against GRFT-resistant strains of HIV (Moulaei et al., 2015). These GRFT tandemers were able to show similar activity against HIV strains lacking oligosaccharides at positions N234 and N295 on the HIV-1 subtype C Env glycoproteins which renders the virus resistant to the monomeric and WT GRFT forms (Fig. 1) (Alexandre et al., 2010).",

The H84T mutation in BanLec is thought to mediate mitogenicity by imparting decreased affinity for complex sugars. Hybrid lectins have also been produced from PFA and OAA to render a protein OPA with improved activity (Koharudin et al., 2012). Other modifications in structure have produced obligate monomeric (Moulaei et al., 2010) or dimeric (Takahashi et al., 2011) proteins in an effort to improve clinical potential. Significant research into these potentially useful modifications is necessary to truly develop these agents for human use.",
