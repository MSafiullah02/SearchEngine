            "text": "The FMV is a live, attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent influenza vaccine that is administered intranasally. It contains three influenza strains: B, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1. Each strain is a 6/2 reassortant in which the two genomic segments encoding the primary surface antigens, hemaggluttinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), are derived from antigenically relevant wild-type strains [1]. The products of these genes confer the ability to induce protective immunity against currently circulating influenzas [2] and are taken from isolates that are recommended annually for inclusion in vaccine formulations. The remaining six genomic segments are derived from master donor virus (MDV) strains which are themselves derived from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 and B/Ann Arbor/1/66 strains, originally isolated in 1960 and 1966, respectively. The original isolates were evolved by serial passage at sequentially lower temperatures to confer the temperature-sensitive, cold-adapted, and attenuated phenotype [3]. Previous studies have shown that live vaccine strains can be recovered from vaccinated individuals for up to 21 days post-vaccination and could therefore yield false influenza-positive results on RT-PCR tests, rapid antigen assays and culture-based diagnostics [4], [5]. In one study, shedding was demonstrated in 50% of the vaccinated subjects 3 days post-vaccination, and in approximately 5% seven days post-vaccination [5]. Given that our study population (military recruits) is highly vaccinated and our samples are generally collected during training within approximately 10 weeks of vaccination, the risk of generating false-positive influenza results due to FMV shedding is significant.",

The universal influenza primers used by NHRC (sets 1, 2 and 7 in Table 1\n) and many of the primers described in the literature [7] target conserved regions in the matrix gene and are incapable of discriminating between the MDVs and current circulating strains. To ensure that influenza-positive samples identified by routine influenza A and influenza B RT-PCR assays are community-acquired infections and not the result of shedding from recent vaccination, primers were developed that can discriminate between the MDVs and currently circulating influenza strains.",

With this evolutionary pattern in mind, strain-specific discriminating primers were designed for the three MDVs and for circulating strains of the three dominant influenza A subtypes (H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2) and influenza B. Each set of primers exploits polymorphisms that arose in specific subtype lineages after the isolation of the relevant vaccine strain. Fig. 1\ndepicts our primer choice strategy in the context of a sequence alignment that illustrates the general pattern of influenza evolution, using the influenza A H3N2 matrix gene and the FMV_A (not H3N2) forward primer as an example.",

This pattern represents the fact that current H1N1 and H3N2 matrix genes have diverged independently from the MDV sequence, and hence differ from the MDV in different ways. Thus, a single pair of PCR tests cannot differentiate between the entire spectrum of circulating strains of influenza A and the FMV influenza A MDV. The FMV_A (not H3N2) primers can distinguish the influenza A MDV from circulating H3N2 strains, but will also give a positive result for circulating H1N1 strains (all primers are shown in Table 1). The Circ_H1N1 (not vaccine) primers, designed to yield a positive result for all current H1N1 strains, will not give a positive result for the MDV but will yield a positive result for some circulating H3N2 strains. Hence, a definitive identification of the influenza A MDV requires three results: a positive with the FMV_A primer set, and negative results with both the Circ_H3N2 and Circ_H1N1 primer sets. An analysis matrix is presented in Table 2\nfor clarity. There are no such issues with influenza B typing because all currently circulating influenza Bs are in the same distinct clade with respect to the influenza B MDV.",

If the pathogen has already been identified as influenza A, a paired test with the Circ_H3N2 primers and the FMV_A primers will usually definitively identify the strain as community-acquired by giving a positive result for the Circ_H3N2 primers only. However, if these tests yield a negative result with the Circ_H3N2 primers and a positive result with the FMV_A primers, then the Circ_H1N1 primers must be used to determine if the strain is vaccine or H1N1. These three PCRs should definitively discriminate between FMV shedding and circulating strains in 99% of influenza A cases (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/). Finally, rare H1N2 strains have also been identified in recent years, and some of these are slightly diverged from H3N2 at the Circ_H3N2 primer sites. Hence, we also present primers designed to catch these circulating strains.",

However, it is unlikely that circulating strains will back mutate to (or be replaced by) strains with target alleles identical to those of the vaccine strain, and hence it is improbable that the vaccine primers will ever require replacement. The inclusion of primer pairs for both the vaccine and circulating strains allows identification of genetic drift affecting recognition by one primer pair because such changes will yield strains that give negatives on all tests.

Each alignment also included the matrix sequence of the FMV influenza A MDV, kindly provided by Jin Hong (MedImmune, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Vaccine-specific primers were chosen that would amplify sequences from the MDV and not from the primary current circulating subtype (H3N2), while circulating strain primers were chosen for each subtype that would amplify sequences from circulating strains and not from the vaccine strain (all primers shown in Table 1). The same methods were used to design primers that distinguish circulating influenza B from the influenza B MDV. Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).",

The NHRC influenza A surveillance RT-PCR involves two independent amplifications with different primer sets, and positives represent samples that yielded amplicons for both primer sets. Influenza B identifications were initially achieved at NHRC by either culture/IF or with a single universal influenza B real-time PCR (Set 7, Table 1). From this surveillance collection, we chose 104 influenza-positive TS samples collected during the 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 influenza seasons, between December and March. Four similar samples were chosen that had been collected during the intervening non-influenza season, from September to November 2005. Additionally, seven TS samples were collected from healthy individuals at Lackland Air Force Base and processed in a similar fashion. These samples were from individuals who had received FMV within one week of sample collection and had previously tested negative for influenza by both culture and RT-PCR. Two influenza B-positive TS samples were collected from symptomatic individuals from a US/Mexico border population with very low vaccination rates (assumed to be unvaccinated), and one nasal swab sample was collected from one of the authors (N.E.F.) who had just received FMV.",

Supporting results include the four samples from FMV-vaccinated recruits who tested positive for both vaccine and circulating influenza A strains and the positive results from the control nasal swab sample of an author taken immediately after FMV vaccination. Most importantly, this fall our lab identified what appeared to be four very early-season influenza A infections at recruit training centers using our primary RT-PCR method, discoveries that would have been of epidemiological concern given the time of year. However, all four of these samples tested positive by FMV_A primers and negative by Circ_H3N2 and Circ_H1N1 primers (see Table 7), suggesting that the original FluA_Universal positive results were due to shedding of vaccine strains. This suggestion was substantiated by the facts that these recruits had been vaccinated with FMV within a few days of sampling and these samples did not yield culturable virus at 37\u00b0C. The results show that influenza-positive RT-PCR results from surveillance of vaccinated populations during times when pathogenic influenza is not widely circulating are likely to be false-positives from FMV strain shedding, strongly supporting the epidemiological and clinical necessity of tests that can discriminate between vaccine strains and circulating pathogenic strains. This is particularly critical at a time when public health agencies are increasing off-season influenza surveillance in an effort to protect the public from the threat of an influenza pandemic.",
