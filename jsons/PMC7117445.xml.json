There are various infectious agents which cause diarrhea and various factors including herd management, animal nutrition and environmental conditions affect the severity of the disease (Cho et al., 2013, Kaplon et al., 2013). Rotaviruses (RV) are one of the major causative agents of neonatal diarrhea in calves worldwide (Okada and Matsumoto, 2002, Alkan et al., 2010, Martella et al., 2010, da Silva Medeiros et al., 2015). Vaccines containing RV antigens are commercially available and commonly used to prevent RV diarrhea in young calves.",

Based on the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the inner capsid protein, VP6, RVs are divided into eight groups (or species; designated from A to H) (Matthijnssens et al., 2009) and new data suggest that a candidate ninth group can also be distinguished (Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015). Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the most commonly detected RV species in the gastrointestinal infection in cattle, although Group B and C rotaviruses are also regularly identified. RVAs are classified into G (glycoprotein) and P (protease sensitive) types according to the sequence diversity of the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, respectively, which independently generate serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies in vivo (Monini et al., 2008, Matthijnssens et al., 2011, Papp et al., 2013). Increased diversity in RVA strains is generated principally by accumulation of point mutations and by reassortment of cognate genes. In addition, interspecies transmission is another important way to increase viral diversity in a host species (Papp et al., 2013). To date, at least 27 G and 37 P genotypes have been defined in mammals and avians (da Silva Medeiros et al., 2015). Among these, the most common G and P genotypes in cattle are G6, G8, G10 (for VP7) and P[1], P[5], P[11] P[15], and P[21] (for VP4) (Martella et al., 2010, Papp et al., 2013). More recently, the classification system of RVAs was extended to include the remaining capsid and non-structural protein genes; this new system denotes the VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6 genes of a rotavirus strain by the descriptor Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx, where x indicates the genotype number (Matthijnssens et al., 2011).",

Calves could be protected from diarrhea by appropriate management techniques and vaccination strategies. However, the potential of gene reassortment among various strains, the antigenic and genetic diversity between vaccine and field strains, the insufficient protection raised by vaccine strains against heterotypic strains and inappropriate vaccination strategy might be reasons for vaccine failure and thus remain a concern (Papp et al., 2013, da Silva Medeiros et al., 2015).",

Due to economic reasons the management decided to change the vaccine type in 2014. \u2018Vaccine A\u2019 was used in 2012\u20132013 and contained two RVA genotypes, G6 and G10, (in addition to coronavirus, Escherichia coli having the K99 pili adherence factor and Clostridium perfringens type C), whereas \u2018vaccine B\u2019 contained a single RVA genotype, G6P[5], (in addition to coronavirus, Escherichia coli with K99 pilus type),",

The intestinal content from a dead calf and four fecal samples from calves with diarrhea were tested for rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli K99 antigens by using a commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX Rota-Corona-K99, Ag Test) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For this reason, microplates coated with a mix of antibodies against 3 mentioned antigens were used. The faeces diluted (1/10) in dilution buffer were plated triplicate into the wells and incubated on the microplate for 30 min at room temperature (approximately 25 \u00b0C). After this first incubation step, the plate was washed by manually using the washing solution, and then each pathogen specific conjugates, peroxidase-labelled anti-pathogen monoclonal antibodies, were added to the related wells. The plate was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature again. Following the final wash, the chromogen (tetramethylbenzidine) was added to each well and the plate was held at room temperature away from light for 10 min. A stop solution was added and the optical densities were measured at 450 nm using an ELISA Reader. The ELISA reader optical density data was calculated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The samples were also tested for bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) by RT-PCR (Park et al., 2007, Park et al., 2008).",

Random primed RT-PCR coupled with high-throughput sequencing detected two G8P[5] RVA strains from fecal specimen or intestinal content. The two strains, RVA/Cow-wt/TUR/Amasya-1/2015/G8P[5] and RVA/Cow-wt/TUR/Amasya-2/2015/G8P[5], were essentially identical, suggesting the outbreak was caused by the introduction of a single strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these two strains presented a G8-P[5]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 genomic constellation, which is a typical bovine genotype constellation of RVAs. However, only the VP4, VP6, and NSP4 gene phylogenies were consistent with the bovine origin of the identified strains. In other genes (such as VP1, VP2, VP3 and NSP2), we observed genetic relationship between the Turkish strains and other ruminant RVAs and zoonotic human RVA strains. This apparent genetic relationship between bovine and ovine RVA strains and zoonotic human RVA strains shows the complex interaction and pattern of gene flow among heterologous RVA strains, which may be multidirectional among ruminants and typically leads to dead-end infection from a ruminant host to human beings. Moreover, the VP7 gene clustered with human G8 RVA strains reported from Croatia, Germany and Slovenia (Steyer et al., 2007, Pietsch et al., 2009, Delogu et al., 2013) and they represented a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree clearly distinct from other bovine-like G8 strains and caprine RVA strains detected previously in Turkey (represented by RVA/goat-tc/TUR/Kirklareli/2007/G8P[1]) (Alkan et al., 2012). Although it has been hypothesized for a while that in many instances the G8 VP7 genotype may have originated from the bovine host through interspecies transmission and reassortment (Adah et al., 2003, Chitamber et al., 2011, Ghosh et al., 2011) the putative heterologous RVA strain is seldom identified in these studies. The new sequence information generated in our study helps identify the host species origin of the contemporary European lineage of human G8 RVA strains by providing some evidence that the VP7 gene of these human-animal reassortant strains originate from a bovine host. At present the spatial connection between the Turkish bovine and the European human cases is not clear; however Turkey imports large number of live animals from Europe each year (http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/beef-veal/presentations/market-situation_en.pdf) and it is possible that the identified Turkish G8 strain was imported from a European country more recently. The hypothesis of a relatively recent introduction is supported by findings of past RVA strain surveillance data conducted over a 12-year period from 1997 to 2008 that indicated a lack of circulation of G8 strains in Turkish cattle herds. Thus, this is the first description of the G8 genotype in Turkish bovine RVAs, even though this same genotype was reported as a cause of high mortality diarrhea outbreak in two goat flocks (Alkan et al., 2012). It remains to be studied whether there are some factors responsible for restriction of host species jump of G8 RVAs from goats to cattle that could have prevented the transmission of caprine G8 RVA strains to emerge in calf herds.",

It is well known that VP7 and VP4 are involved in viral neutralization in vitro and likely in vivo, and the binary combination classifying these antigens has been used in many molecular epidemiological studies to describe the distribution of field RVA strains and to develop vaccination strategy in animals and also humans (Delogu et al., 2013). Detection of a G8P[5] RVA strain in a herd routinely vaccinated against RVA infection by using commercial, heterotypic strains is an interesting finding and raise some questions. Firstly, which were the circulating RVA antigen type specificities during and before the implementation of vaccination? Secondly, at what extent did commercial vaccines provide heterologous protection against RVA strains in Turkey? Thirdly, did vaccine strain specificity influence the emergence of a heterotypic strain? There are many notifications from different parts of the world that indicate the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea after vaccination caused by genotypes either identical to or different from that of represented by RVA vaccines (Lorenzetti et al., 2011). Lu et al. (1994) reported that due to the various level of cross protection between different P genotypes, protection of calves from mothers which were vaccinated with particular P type(s) that is different from that of seen in the wild-type strains, was failed. It is reported that persistence of rotaviral diarrhea could be caused by different P genotypes identified from the specimens although using G6P[1] vaccine strains for years in America (Lu et al., 1994). In the present study we identified a genotype G8P[5] field strain that caused severe diarrhea and deaths in a herd immunized with inactivated vaccine strain containing genotype G6P[5]. Thus, the P type specificity was shared between the vaccine and the field strain, while the G type specificity was different, pointing out the possible importance of the other neutralization antigen, the VP7.",
