For acute infection, CSF immunoglobulin M (IgM) is generally diagnostic of intrathecal antibody production, since IgM does not cross the bloodbrain barrier well, although blood introduced into the CSF sample during LP can lead to false-positive results. Because IgM antibodies can be cross-reactive for viruses within the same family (e.g., flavivirus), serology is generally conducted in two steps. The first is often screening with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), in which a patient's sample is allowed to bind to an immobilized antigen, then a secondary antibody targets the immunoglobulin. IgM immunoglobulins are often captured first to reduce background from potentially crossreactive immunoglobulin G (IgG). Samples positive by screening EIA undergo confirmatory testing, e.g., with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), in which serial dilutions of patient sample are mixed with virus then incubated with cell culture to look for plaque formation. 13 In contrast to IgM, IgG does cross the blood-brain barrier, so diagnosis of chronic or reactivated infections requires demonstration of an elevated CSF:serum IgG ratio, normalized to the CSF:serum ratio of albumin. Testing antibody responses from the serum can also aid in diagnosis, but must be interpreted carefully, since prior vaccination or treatment with blood products can lead to false-positive results. In some cases, IgG avidity can be used to distinguish recent infection (low avidity) from prior infection or vaccination (high avidity).

In addition, unlike other herpesviruses, HHV-6 can also integrate into the human genome. 76 This occurs within telomeres, and is called chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6). Approximately 1% of the population have ciHHV-6 acquired at birth and expressed in every cell in their body, leading to asymptomatic high-grade HHV-6 expression.

Examples include bacteria such as Leptospira 107 and Brucella, 108,109 fungi such as Candida tropicalis, 110 protozoa such as Balamuthia, 111 and viruses such as WNV 112 and hepatitis E virus. 113 In addition to CSF, metagenomic sequencing has successfully detected pathogens in brain tissue, 114, 115 and in the bloodstream of a patient with a brain abscess due to Scedosporium. 116 Although much of this work has been conducted in research settings, multiple case reports have demonstrated the clinical utility of rapid metagenomic sequencing. 107, 108, 117, 118 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 730, "end": 734, "text": "105,", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 735, "end": 738, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1331, "text": "111", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1359, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1386, "text": "113", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1487, "text": "114,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1491, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1573, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1740, "text": "107,", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1745, "text": "108,", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "117,", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1754, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Approach and Use in Clinical Settings"}, {"text": "Case reports have highlighted some of the remarkable strengths of metagenomic sequencing compared with standard testing. For pathogens that are commonly diagnosed by serology, metagenomic sequencing can offer a faster turnaround time 118 and can achieve a diagnosis in patients in whom antibodies are unreliable, e.g., due to treatment with rituximab. 119 For pathogens that can be detected by PCR, metagenomic sequencing offers advantages of high sensitivity and independence from pathogen-specific primers. Highlighting the benefit of using an unbiased approach, metagenomic sequencing has yielded unexpected findings in immunocompromised patients including coronavirus, 120 Cache Valley virus, 121 and mumps vaccine-associated encephalitis. 122 It can even identify novel pathogens. 123 When applied broadly, metagenomic sequencing can help reveal the importance of an underappreciated pathogen such as astrovirus. 117, [124] [125] [126] In addition to its direct diagnostic uses, metagenomic sequencing can also provide information about pathogen genomics and molecular epidemiology. 122, 127, 128 However, despite its many strengths, there are also limitations to metagenomic sequencing. Most importantly, it relies upon the presence of pathogen nucleic acid in the sample tested. As discussed, some CNS syndromes are believed to be caused not by the pathogen itself but by the resulting immune response, and metagenomic sequencing will not detect antibody-mediated processes. Some viruses replicate for a short duration in the CNS, e.g., WNV 14 ; these will not be detectable by metagenomic sequencing routinely, but may be more easily detected in immunocompromised patients due to longer viral replication. 112 Adding to this challenge, in some cases, the utility of metagenomic sequencing cannot be predicted ahead of time. For example, enterovirus is readily detected by metagenomic sequencing in cases of meningitis. 110, 128, 129 By contrast, in many recent patients with AFM, enterovirus has not been detected from CSF, but EV68 RNA has been detected in respiratory samples, 130 and EV68 is believed to be a causative pathogen for AFM. 131 A second limitation to metagenomic sequencing is that its very high sensitivity leads to high background from microbes present on the patient's skin and from laboratory reagents. This leads to the need for careful interpretation of results and stringent use of negative controls. 132 As an example, Salzberg et al 115 detected sequencing reads from Delftia and Elizabethkingia in brain tissue samples from one patient with meningitis and another with a brain mass, respectively. The authors were appropriately skeptical of the causal role of these agents in causing the observed disease. A later study demonstrated that reads from Delftia, Elizabethkingia, and other organisms are present in many negative control samples, and suggested the use of a statistical scoring technique to distinguish signal from noise. 133", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 237, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 697, "end": 700, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 744, "end": 747, "text": "122", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 786, "end": 789, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 918, "end": 922, "text": "117,", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 923, "end": 928, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 929, "end": 934, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 935, "end": 940, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "122,", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1097, "text": "127,", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "128", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1717, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1931, "text": "110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1936, "text": "128,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1940, "text": "129", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2090, "text": "130", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2148, "end": 2151, "text": "131", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2435, "text": "132", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths and Limitations"}, {"text": "As metagenomic sequencing moves into clinical practice, it is becoming increasingly important to define its test characteristics, both through detailed use of negative controls to define specificity, as well as validation studies to definite sensitivity. Validation for metagenomic sequencing is challenging because, unlike traditional tests, there are a multitude of possible outcomes, and it is not possible to validate every potential pathogen. It is has therefore been proposed to validate a subset of organisms representing different general characteristics (e.g., viruses with different genome structures, or bacteria with different cell-wall types) using samples from patients with confirmed infection, as well as mock samples created both in vitro and in silico. 134 This approach has been described for CSF as well as respiratory samples, with report of overall sensitivity on the order of 70% and specificity >90%. 134 Using mock samples, the limit of detection for various organisms has been estimated to range between 10 to 100 copies/mL for viruses, on the order of 10 CFU/mL for bacteria, and between 0.01 and >100 CFU/mL for fungi. 134 Factors that can contribute to low sensitivity include a low level of pathogen nucleic acid, a high level of host nucleic acid as background, and a poor match between a particular pathogen's genome and the representatives included in the reference database. There is likely variability in these factors not only between types of pathogens (e.g., enterovirus versus WNV), but also between specific pathogens of the same type in different hosts (e.g., WNV in immunocompetent vs. immunocompromised patients). Factors that can contribute to low specificity include contamination from organisms on the patient's skin, microbe components present in reagents, or contamination from the laboratory environment or other samples included on the same sequencing run.

Panel (A) represents key anatomic compartments for sampling. Panel (B) provides an overview of the major diagnostic modalities. (I) Indirect evidence of infection can be provided by pathogenspecific antibody responses. Illustrated is a generic ELISA. (II) Gram stain and culture are performed for bacterial and fungal pathogens. (III) Pathogen antigen detection is most often performed by a modification of the ELISA assay. (IV) PCR detects nucleic acid from a prespecified target. (V) Multiplex PCR expands (IV) to examine a set of predetermined targets. (VI) Metagenomic sequencing amplifies all nucleic acid directly from a biological sample, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, as well as human nucleic acid and microbes present in reagent or laboratory environment. Bioinformatic analyses are used to identify potential pathogens. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.
