With inconclusive histopathological features, PCR from superficial swabs, skin scrapings or the tumour mass can be helpful (Martens et al, 2000, Martens et al, 2001a). Six clinical types with individual growth characteristics and local behaviour have been described. These include occult, verrucose (\u2018warty\u2019), nodular, fibroblastic, mixed and malignant forms (Knottenbelt, 2005). Focal dermal accumulations of fibroblastoid cells, usually in association with hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and rete peg formation (RPF) of the overlying epidermis are typical histological features. Neoplastic cells often show \u2018picket fence\u2019 alignment along the epidermis and are generally locally invasive (Marti et al, 1993, Martens et al, 2000, Scott, Miller, 2003). The latter possibly accounts for the high recurrence rate of up to 50%, and the progression from milder forms to the more aggressive types (Marti et al, 1993, Martens et al, 2001b, Knottenbelt, 2005).",

Upregulation of the chemokine CXCL5 indicates an inflammatory response which is assumed to facilitate sarcoid growth/invasion. Concurrent downregulation of immune response genes, such as TLR-4 and MHC-I, most likely enables viral infection and persistence (Yuan et al, 2008a, Yuan et al, 2010a). Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1 and -9 are also markedly up regulated. MMPs may be responsible for tumour invasiveness since their expression and BPV-1 infection supports fibroblast invasion in vitro (Yuan et al, 2008a, Yuan et al, 2010b). We aimed to assess local tumour behaviour and in vivo MMP expression in naturally occurring sarcoids using histology, immunohistological detection of MMP-1, -2 and -9, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",

Expression is regulated at transcriptional level, and induced, for example, by cytokines and growth factors (Shapiro, 1998, Westermarck, K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1999, Fields, 2013). Produced in an inactive form, MMP-1 is activated by several enzymes (K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1997, Westermarck, K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1999). In equine sarcoids, MMP-1 is present in its active form (Yuan et al., 2010b), and its release by neoplastic cells may be responsible for infiltrative dermal tumour growth, via partial destruction of the ECM, i.e. the cleaving of collagen III. This indicates increased ECM turnover, and indeed, sarcoids have been shown to exhibit an overall lower amount of collagen than the normal equine dermis, through an increased and more organised, fibrous collagen III network (Williams et al., 1982). The fate of the cleaved collagen III remains unclear, since further degrading requires the gelatinases, MMP-2 and -9 (Shapiro, 1998, Visse, Nagase, 2003, Fields, 2013), neither of which were found to be up regulated in the present nor a previous study (Yuan et al., 2010b).",

Its upper lamina lucida and lower lamina densa solidly attach the epidermis to the dermis. This anchoring system is composed of hemidesmosomes at the basal pole of the basal keratinocytes, thin anchoring filaments that traverse the lamina lucida, and anchoring fibrils (composed of collagen VII loops) originating from the lamina densa and extending towards the dermis, as well as collagen IV and laminin networks which provide the basic scaffolding of the BM and are linked via nidogen. The keratin filament of the hemidesmosomes binds to laminin 5 which in turn binds to, among others, collagen VII (McMillan et al, 2003, Breitkreutz et al, 2013). MMP-1 can degrade laminins and collagen VII; with the destruction of these two proteins, i.e. the anchoring fibrils and one of the two main networks (Shapiro, 1998, Villone et al, 2008), the BM would lose its normal stable architecture. This could account for the BM destruction seen with PFF in sarcoids and might also render the skin overlying the neoplastic infiltrate more vulnerable and liable to ulceration.",

This is not encountered in sarcoids. However, MMP-2 is also expressed by hyperproliferative keratinocytes (Krengel et al., 2002) which are found in the epidermis overlying equine sarcoids (Martens et al., 2000). This may account for the slight increase in epidermal MMP-2 expression in some of our cases. The latter was particularly obvious in association with PFF, suggesting that direct contact between the epidermis and fibroblasts is a prerequisite of proliferation (Martens et al., 2000). Alternatively, BPV-1, found to productively infect the epidermis overlying natural sarcoids (Brandt et al., 2011), could induce keratinocyte hyperproliferation.",

Invasion is the major constraint to therapy. The likelihood of recurrence is highest with surgical methods that do not include a safe margin but the difficulty in defining a safe margin for any individual lesion is a significant surgical challenge. The likelihood of recurrence is seemingly correlated with the presence of BPV DNA in the surgical margins (Martens et al., 2001c). Topical and intralesional chemotherapy options may fail because the tumour extends beyond the reach of the chemotherapeutic agent (Knottenbelt and Kelly, 2000). This study suggests that, excluding the malignant form which we have not examined, the risks of invasion are not significantly different in any particular sarcoid subtype. Early, pre-emptive, use of medications that could alter the tendency to invasion through manipulation of MMP-1 expression might provide improved outcomes when they are subsequently treated either surgically or medically.",
