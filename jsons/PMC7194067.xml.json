This was previously described in detail elsewhere and details are beyond scope of this report.4\n,\n5 Briefly, we retrieved the file previously designed by engineer and made publicly available for free download. File was saved in standard tessellation language (STL) from Airwolf 3-D\u00ae (https://airwolf3d.com/2020/03/27/covid-19-face-shield-3d-printable-file/). Next, we digitally prepared (i.e. converted) STL to G-code file using PrusaSlicer\u00ae 2.0. The G-code is the language used by computer to communicate with the printer. G-code file contains specific information regarding (1) printer setting (i.e. nozzle diameter and position, height limit), (2) print setting (i.e. 3-D printed layer height, horizontal and vertical dimensions), and (3) filament setting (i.e. type, color, diameter, density). This step is important because it controls the quality of the printed product, and the printer\u2019s speed (production time). The G-code file is saved on a secure digital (SD) card. We then transferred the G-code from computer to printer using SD card.",

We placed the filament into the extruder and turned on the printing function. Once the procedure was complete, we had the frame for the shield (Figure 1\n).",

Each 10-inch velcro hooked on the lateral projections at each end of frame (Figure 2\n). This velcro\u00ae secures the frame to the head. Next, the adhesive foam was cut into a 12-inch long strip. We attached the sticky side to the inner circumference of the frame (Figure 2). The foam acts as a cushion and prevents abrasions of the user\u2019s forehead with extended wear. Using a hole puncher, we punched 3 holes, 4-inches apart on the wide side of the transparency films. Finally, each hole fit snugly into one the 3 rounded projections along the frame (Figure 2).",

Maintaining a good balance between printing time and quality is important; adjusting the above parameters should be done with caution in order to maintain the quality of the final 3D object. Increasing extruded layer height or having larger nozzle will decrease the printing time. Our printer\u2019s speed was 80-100mm/s. In order to print multiple frames during same time interval (i.e. decrease the production time), we stacked frames on top of each other and then individually separating them (Figure 3\n). In our project, the required production time was 5 hours. Other designs production time varied from 3.5 to 9.5 hours depending on the size of the original design.",
