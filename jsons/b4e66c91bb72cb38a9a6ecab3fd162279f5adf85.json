Relative to where that country started, this minimum containment level required to prevent the epidemic from growing further would represent a 75% reduction of transmission. Countries like Ireland, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, where daily incidence rates are now slowly falling (Rc<1.0), so their epidemics could slowly fizzle away if current measures were maintained, may well have achieved 80% suppression of transmission. If sustained, current measures in these countries could be expected to see their incidence rates shrink by 98% but not disappear over the course of a year ( Figure 1A ). While this is a considerable achievement, it begs the question why these countries would not build upon their successes by further improving their epidemic response intervention packages to steepen the downslope they now find themselves on and then pursue the sequential goals of elimination and exclusion? By improving the impact of control efforts beyond the initial flattening threshold of 75% transmission reduction, so that a further 10% of transmission is prevented, would result in an overall transmission reduction of 85% and an epidemic that would contract by 40% (Rc=0.6) every 3 weeks (Approximate mean duration of infection 2 ) before petering out after a year ( Figure 1A ). Squeeze transmission down by just another 5% overall (90% reduction, Rc=0.4) and local transmission may collapse within 30 weeks ( Figure 1A ).",

Furthermore, such impressive reductions of transmission rate and relatively rapid escape trajectories from self-sustaining local transmission may be far easier to rationalize in simple arithmetic terms by considering two important, intuitive and encouraging non-linearities of pathogen outbreak and containment dynamics: (1) Transmission requires exposure behaviours by two individuals, so transmission varies in proportion to the square of the relative rates of those preventable exposure behaviours, and (2) Even modest acceleration of proportional decay rates can dramatically curtail the length of time it takes for them to approach zero.",

When intervention effectiveness is expressed as the mean proportional reduction of individual exposure behaviours, a steadystate flattened curve is achieved at an effective protective coverage of only 50% ( Figure 1B and C). Even very modest further reductions beyond this threshold result in remarkably steep expected downslopes for epidemic contraction ( Figure 1C ). For example, incidence rates are expected to drop by a third every three weeks at an effective protective coverage of 60% (R0=0.64) and by almost two thirds (R0=0.36) at an effective protective coverage of 70% ( Figure 1B and C) .",

However, the equally important implications of non-linearities in exponential decay curves are less widely appreciated. Analogous to eating a cake in proportion to its remaining size, it takes a long time to get down to the last crumbs if one eats a third, and then a third of the remaining two thirds, and so on. By comparison, consuming two thirds the first time, and then two thirds of the remaining one third the second time, reduces the cake much faster. In fact, the remaining fraction of the hypothetical cake will be four times smaller (1/9 versus 4/9) after only removing two slices and the difference in relative size grows rapidly as these two trajectories proceed. The same simple arithmetic rules apply to epidemic containment, so the expected trajectories for 60% and 70% effective protective coverage in figure 1C resemble those for our hypothetical cake. Correspondingly, these two modestly ambitious containment levels, which differ by only 10% in terms of effective protective coverage, need to be maintained for very different periods before the last cases are expected to occur. While lowering the incidence rate from 10,000 to only 1 case per week is expected to take 60 weeks at 60% effective protective coverage, the same near-elimination threshold would be reached after only 27 weeks at 70% effective protective coverage ( Figure 1C ). At 80% effective protective coverage, only 15 weeks are required to approach elimination ( Figure 1C) , and while the \"10 weeks to crush the curve\" hypothesis 7 appears questionably optimistic, it might nevertheless be plausible if 85% protective coverage could be achieved.",

Success will require meticulous closure of remaining gaps in preventative intervention coverage, as well as comprehensive containment of case importation through travel and trade. 2 However, many tractable opportunities remain to be exploited for closing the various intervention loopholes that allow residual transmission to persist through essential workers, goods and services of all kinds. 2 And many encouraging precedents exist for certifying countries as free from infection with veterinary pathogens like swine fever 12 or human pathogens like malaria. 13 It is also encouraging that viral outbreaks of Ebola in 2014 and 2018, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 all threated to become larger pandemics but were successfully contained and eliminated. However, the most convincing reason to be optimistic about SARS-CoV-2 is that several countries in Asia and the Pacific that have already crushed their epidemic curves are well on the way to elimination and exclusion endpoints.",
