Due to their similar genomic organization, they are classified within the same family Picornaviridae together with the human enteroviruses (HEV) [2, 3] . However, the common genomic features reflect modestly the characteristics of these viruses in terms of tropism and pathogenic potential. HRVs generally cause mild infections, replicating in the upper respiratory tract, but, in infants and immunocompromised patients, HRVs can reach the lower respiratory tract causing serious illnesses and act as pathogens or copathogens in bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [4, 5] . Recently a new HRV lineage designated HRV-C has been identified using molecular methods and associated with severe clinical presentations in infants and immunocompromised adults [6] . The majority of HEVs instead replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, eventually spreading to other organs such as the heart or the central nervous system giving rise to serious diseases. Only a few HEV genotypes can occasionally be identified in the respiratory secretions of patients with lower respiratory tract infections [5, 7] . Moreover, a novel HEV (HEV 104) was identified in Switzerland and later in other countries often in association with respiratory signs [7, 8] . Finally, a novel HEV (HEV 109) was molecularly identified in the nose and throat swab samples collected between June 2007 and June 2008 from children enrolled in a cohort study of influenzalike illness in Nicaragua, in some cases also associated with enteric symptoms [9] .",

From one to nine samples from each patient were collected every 30 days up to 180 days after transplantation. At each time point all the clinical data were collected. RNA was purified from all samples using the Qiagen RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer protocol. To investigate HRV infections, all samples, were subjected to first round amplification after sample extraction using Primers P1-1 (CAA GCA CTT CTG TYW CCC C) and P3-1 (ACG GAC ACC CAA AGT AG); and semi-nested amplification was performed using forward primer P1-1 and three reversed primers P2-1 (CAA GCA CTT CTG TYW CCC C), P2-2 (TTA GCC ACA TTC AGG AGC C) and P2-3 (TTA GCC GCA TTC AGG GG) as described previously [12] . Since HEV 109 was initially cross-amplified also with the previous amplification protocol (designed to amplify the widest number of Picornaviruses), we decided to further evaluate HEV 109 prevalence by using specific primers targeting the NTR region of HEV 109 (EV109 VP1 123F, 5 -GGA GAC TGG AGC AAC TAG TAA AG-3 ; EV109 VP1 363R, 5 -GGT GAA CAT TTC CAA TTT CCT ACG-3 ).",

Since multiple infections are frequently detected in respiratory samples of patients with respiratory symptoms and to better clarify the pathogenetic role of picornaviruses in coinfections, all specimens positive for HRVs or HEV 109, were also assayed for the presence of other thirteen respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza viruses (PIV 1-3), influenza A and B viruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), and adenoviruses, using a multiplex PCR strategy (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection, Seegene, Rockville). Moreover, rhinovirus positive samples were also tested for human bocaviruses (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV) and of the recently identified WU and KI polyomaviruses, using protocols described previously [13, 14] .",

In 2 out of the 7 HRV-C samples coinfections with hMPV or hCoV were identified and both were symptomatic. All of the other monoinfected HRV-C positive samples were asymptomatic. Finally, 8 out of the 15 HRV-A strains and the HRV-B strains resulted to be associated with upper respiratory symptoms such as rhinorrhea, pharingodinia or tussis, being 4 of them coinfected with other pathogens.",

The tedious pharngodynia suffered by this patient in the absence of other coinfecting respiratory viruses suggests a direct pathogenetic role of this virus as speculated in initial observations [9] . Overall, HRV infections were common and frequently asymptomatic in this group of patients, including the majority of rhinoviruses infections due to HRV-C strains. In two patients with rhinorrhea, the HRV-C strains were detected together with other coinfecting viral pathogens. These results do not confirm the previously observed high pathogenic potential of this lineage, at least in immunocompromised hosts [6] .",

Nevertheless as recently suggested, symptomatic or asymptomatic viral infections can trigger acute rejection and obliterative bronchiolitis in lung transplant recipients and warrant a continuous monitoring in immunocompromised patients, with methods able to identify an always wider panel of potential viral pathogens [15] .",
