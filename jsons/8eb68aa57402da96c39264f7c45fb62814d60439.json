Although it seems that children with diabetes have not shown a different disease pattern compared with their non-diabetic counterparts, clinicians caring for diabetic children should not become complacent, particularly in these early days when new evidence is still emerging. We continue to recommend a cautious approach in the management strategies for children with diabetes, as individuals with underlying diabetes are at increased risk of severe pulmonary infections, and diabetes was found to be a risk factor for mortality in patients infected with severe acute respiratory Specifically, those with type 1 diabetes should adhere to standard \"sick day\" guidelines with increased frequency of monitoring of blood glucose and ketones. In addition, frequent changes in dosage and correction in insulin boluses may be required to maintain normoglycemia. In ill patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage of oral anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin need to be adjusted to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis.",

Although there is some suggestion that ACE-inhibitors may increase the severity of COVID-19, reports are conflicting suggesting both increased ACE level may be a poor prognostic factor for severe pneumonia and that use of ACE-inhibiting agents reduce the severity of pulmonary inflammation. 4 The evidence has not been sufficient to change the practice for patients with diabetes thus far, but the endocrine community should remain vigilant for new evidence and guidance as more information on this issue emerges. On a similar note, there is some suggestion that ibuprofen may increase expression of ACE-2 receptor, potentially increasing binding of the virus to target cells and potentiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 Although this theoretical concern requires further substantiation, the advice from the WHO is to use paracetamol over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of fever associated with COVID-19 which is prudent. 5 It is important for clinicians to be cognizant of the possibility of delayed presentation of new cases of type 1 diabetes, as parents may delay medical attention for their children due to fear of exposure to infection in emergency services. Moreover, parents of children with suboptimal diabetic control who require closer follow up may postpone their appointments due to fear and anxiety. Where available, these patients should be offered the option of remote teleconsultation with their doctors to review their glycemic control and insulin titration, especially for young children. With many countries instituting policies to mandate home quarantine, clinicians also should be mindful of the potential of changes in dietary habits and available food choices as well as reduction in physical activity, which impact glycemic control.",

The use of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) is now the standard of care in many centers worldwide. Closed-loop CGMS systems that incorporate the use of automated decision support systems between insulin pumps and CGMS provide an added benefit, which is that insulin titration can be achieved accurately with good comparability to endocrinologist-decision making. 6 This can reduce the need for intensive physician monitoring. 6 Home testing of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be welcomed by diabetics and their endocrinologists in the face of the COVID-19 crisis.",
