To provide a more reliable definition of ARDS, an expert panel revisited the AECC definition and released the Berlin definition of ARDS [8]. However, the pathological diagnosis of ARDS using lung biopsy was not included in the Berlin definition because of the controversial definition of the pathology and concern about surgical complications [9].",

The current clinical definition of ARDS reflects only nonspecific functional or physiological abnormalities rather than pathological abnormality. Since ARDS may occur with other pathologic findings, it is uncertain if the same management should be applied to all patients. The heterogeneity of patients with ARDS included in therapeutic trials remains a challenge when interpreting results from such trials [13]. Therefore, open lung biopsy sometimes has been performed to better define the pathology and to guide therapeutic management of selected patients with ARDS [14\u201317].",

The pathologic hallmark of ARDS is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) characterized by hyaline membrane formation, lung edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and alveolar epithelial cell injury [19, 20]. A post mortem study showed that 66 % of 127 patients who met the AECC definition of ARDS had typical DAD findings [21]. Another study reported that of the 64 patients diagnosed as having ARDS using AECC criteria, 50 % (32/64) had DAD findings at autopsy [22]. A large retrospective study in Spain revealed that among 356 patients who met the Berlin definition of ARDS, 45 % had DAD at autopsy [23, 24]. However, autopsy results are based on results of analysis of samples from deceased patients and thus, there might be differences to results of analysis in the living. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DAD in patients with ARDS defined by the Berlin definition on open lung biopsy.",

The PEEP levels were set according to a lower PEEP and FiO2 strategy or at least 2 cm H2O above the lower inflection point derived from the P-V tool maneuvers of the ventilator [27]. The plateau airway pressure was maintained below 30 cm H2O combined the PEEP setting and low tidal volume strategy.

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that a DAD identified on pathological examination correlated with increased mortality in patients with ARDS identified using the Berlin definition. In a study by Parambil et al., the hospital mortality rate in patients with DAD was 58 % in patients with ARDS compared to 17 % in patients without ARDS [31]. In a study of patients with ARDS (Papazian et al.), the factors predicting survival included female gender, organ system failure score on the day of biopsy, and biopsy result leading to the addition of a new drug [17]. Another open lung biopsy study was performed in mechanically ventilated patients with undiagnosed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates to determine factors independently associated with survival [33]. They found that the Charlson age-comorbidity index score, number of organ dysfunctions, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on the day of biopsy were associated with survival. A study in patients with non-resolving ARDS, who had open lung biopsy showed that the ICU mortality rate was higher in patients with DAD than in those without DAD (67 % vs 57 %), but this was not significantly different [32]. The present study demonstrated that patients with DAD had significantly increased hospital mortality compared to those without DAD (71.9 % vs 45.5 %, p = 0.007). The poor survival outcome in patients with DAD may imply more severe lung injury in patients with ARDS with vs without DAD. However, no clinical characteristic differentiated between patients with and without DAD before open lung biopsy (Table 5). Our study highlights the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS and discrepancy between the clinical and pathological definitions of ARDS. A distinct phenotype of patients with ARDS characterized by DAD needs to be further addressed due to it having worse outcomes.",

Meanwhile, open lung biopsy could offer a specific diagnosis in 84 % of patients and altered management in 73 % of patients. Our study revealed that the surgical complication rate was 13.9 % and management alteration rate was 48.5 % in these selected patients with ARDS. The survival advantage of open lung biopsy in ARDS is still not approved due to lack of a randomized controlled trial. Practically, it is important to assess the balance between the potential risk of surgical complications and diagnosis or treatment benefit in deciding to perform open lung biopsy.",

Given the patients included retrospectively from the charts, some patients with ARDS may have been missed. In addition, the ICD-9 diagnosis code 518.82 excludes ARDS associated with trauma and surgery and includes all type of hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. Some patients with trauma-associated or surgery-associated ARDS may be missed in our study. However, it is one of the largest studies in patients with ARDS having open lung biopsy. Second, the decision to perform open lung biopsy was highly selective and only 5.5 % of patients with ARDS were referred for biopsy in this study. The results, therefore, are unlikely to be representative of all patients with ARDS. However, the potential for selection bias for patients with ARDS may be lower with open lung biopsy than with autopsy as the patients are alive. Third, only 85 % of patients had BAL before open lung biopsy. Some specific diagnoses may have been missed because their recognition depended on the availability of laboratory facilities. Fourth, the lung specimens were assessed by one pulmonary pathologist only and so the possibility of individual interpretation bias should be considered. Finally, there was no standard treatment for patients with some specific diagnoses, such as interstitial lung disease, after the biopsy result became available. Specific treatments such as corticosteroid therapy might have influenced the survival outcome in these patients.",

According to the results of pathological examination, patients with DAD had poorer outcomes than patients without DAD. However, there was no clinical characteristic that discriminated between patients with and without DAD before open lung biopsy. In future studies of ARDS, the clinical therapeutic trial may focus on this subgroup owing to the high mortality among these patients.
