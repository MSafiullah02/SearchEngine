            "text": "The role of myelinating glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), has been expanded from their effect on rapid axonal conduction to the maintenance of the axon long\u2010term functional integrity (reviewed by Nave and Trapp, 2008). Alterations in these glial cells lead to myelination defects and loss of support for axons, contributing to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore need to understand the endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms that these cells provide throughout adulthood. In addition, these glial cells are responsible for the outcome in response to injury that so much differs between the CNS and PNS. A key step that allows regeneration after injury in the PNS is the clearance of myelin debris, which provides a local permissive environment for axonal regrowth (reviewed by Chen et al., 2007). This critical step is initiated by Schwann cells (SCs) and followed by macrophages recruited from the bloodstream. A complex set of signals are exchanged among the cells at the injury site before remyelination and nerve functional recovery is completed.",

Together with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) they are the only two apolipoproteins endogenously produced in nerves upon injury (Boyles et al., 1990; Spreyer et al., 1990). Both were hypothesized to help in the demyelination or remyelination processes, based on their potential for lipid transport. ApoE was initially thought to be dispensable for sciatic nerve regeneration (Fullerton et al., 1998; Goodrum et al., 1995), although ApoE\u2010KO mice show abnormalities in unmyelinated axons (Fullerton et al., 1998) and ApoE modulates the antigen\u2010presentation capacities of SCs in vitro (Duan etal., 2007). Notably, an experimental in vivo test for the function of ApoD in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been performed so far.",

(5) Low amounts of a given template in a given condition often results in highly variable C\nT values between replicates (ranging between 35 and indetermination) that often prevents statistical evaluation of comparisons that show otherwise clear differences. In comparisons where gene amplification shows an average C\nT > 35 cycles in one of the conditions only (meaning that the gene is either turned off or turned on by the experimental condition), we filtered the outlier C\nT values reflecting marginal expression by substitution with the average C\nT of the quadruplicate. This filter around the average homogenizes values, increasing the weight of the more reliable ones, and allows for on and off changes to be assessed statistically.

However, a mixture of functional differences in sensory and motor components of the recovered nerve can still be present without showing major effects in the CMAP parameters. We therefore performed a set of behavioral tests to examine different components of sensorimotor function after CI (Table 1). Locomotion was assessed by analysis of walking tracks and walking pole tests, and sensory function was assayed by the withdrawal reflex upon mechanical plantar stimulation. Footprint width showed statistically significant changes between WT and ApoD\u2010KO at 14 d\u2010PCI in 40\u2010week mice.

ApoD\u2010KO nerves have a significant increase in the number of macrophages and mast cells in the lesion region, also accompanied by a significant increase in the number of blood vessels (Fig. 6C,E). In addition, we performed double immunofluorescence with Galectin\u20103 and the macrophage marker CD11b to assay which proportion of Galectin\u20103 expression (see Fig. 5) is due to macrophages. Most of Galectin\u20103 labeling co\u2010localizes with the cell\u2010surface macrophage marker (Fig. 6F), reinforcing the idea of an elevated presence of macrophages in the injured ApoD\u2010KO nerves.",
