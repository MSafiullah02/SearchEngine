            "text": "The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool has increased the efficiency of creating genetically modified pigs for use as biomedical or agricultural models. The objectives were to determine if DNA editing resulted in a delay in development to the blastocyst stage or in a skewing of the sex ratio. Six DNA templates (gBlocks) that were designed to express guide RNAs that target the transmembrane protease, serine S1, member 2 (TMPRSS2) gene were in vitro transcribed. Pairs of CRISPR guide RNAs that flanked the start codon and polyadenylated Cas9 were co-injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes and cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were collected as they formed on days 5, 6 or 7. PCR was performed to determine genotype and sex of each embryo. Separately, embryos were surgically transferred into recipient gilts on day 4 of estrus. The rate of blastocyst development was not significantly different between CRISPR injection embryos or the noninjected controls at day 5, 6 or 7 (p = 0.36, 0.09, 0.63, respectively). Injection of three CRISPR sets of guides resulted in a detectable INDEL in 92-100 % of the embryos analyzed. There was not a difference in the number of edits or sex ratio of male to female embryos when compared between days 5, 6 and 7 to the controls (p [ 0.22, [0.85). There were 12 resulting piglets and all 12 had biallelic edits of TMRPSS2. Zygote injection with CRISPR/Cas9 continues to be a highly efficient tool to genetically modify pig embryos.",

For example, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to create pigs with the human albumin cDNA replacing the pig locus resulting in pigs with human serum albumin that could be used to alleviate the shortage and risks associated with human blood (Peng et al. 2015) . CRISPR/Cas9 was also used to target the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene in pig zygotes to model the human von Willebrand disease (vWD) (Hai et al. 2014) . Additionally, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to efficiently manipulate a cell line for a xenotransplantation model. Three genes, GGTA1, CMAH and putative iGb3S were all edited in a cell line that was used for somatic cell nuclear transfer and resulted in live edited piglets (Li et al. 2015) . DNA editing by CRISPR/Cas9 recently made a significant impact on the swine industry when the CD163 gene was edited to create a line of pigs that are resistant to the devastating porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Whitworth et al. 2016) .",

Several studies have shown that CRISPR/Cas9 RNA injection had very little effect on overall blastocyst formation when compared to water injected controls (Hai et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015) . In a previous study, CRISPR/Cas9 RNA injection of pig zygotes resulted in 100 % of the piglets having biallelic DNA edits of the targeted CD163 or CD1D gene (Whitworth et al. 2014) . Interestingly, 7 of the 8 offspring from this study were male. There is very little information published about whether DNA editing by CRISPR/Cas9 affects embryo development and/or the sex of the resulting offspring. The objectives of this study were to measure the effects of CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNA injection on the rate of embryo development and to determine if CRISPR/ Cas9 RNA injection altered the sex ratio of the resulting blastocyst-stage embryos. The secondary objective of this experiment was to create pigs with a DNA edit in the TMPRSS2 gene for use as a biomedical model of pigs that may be resistant to certain types of influenza viruses (Hatesuer et al. 2013; Sakai et al. 2014; Tarnow et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "Design of gRNAs to build specific CRISPRs Guide RNAs were designed to be used in pairs to remove the start codon from exon 2 of the TMPRSS2 gene. Six 18-20 bp guides were designed to target sequence located adjacent to an S. pyogenes (Spy) protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (Ran et al. 2015) . The targets were selected by the following method. Repeat Masker (Smit and Green 1996) (''Pig'' repeat library) was used to identify any repetitive elements in the TMPRSS2 genomic sequence and these areas were not used as potential targets. Specificity of each potential guide was then confirmed by searching for similar porcine sequences in GenBank. If guides and the adjacent PAM sequence had similarity to other areas of the genome, they were removed from subsequent analysis. Lastly, structural analysis of the 20 bp guide with the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and the trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) (Hsu et al. 2013 ) was evaluated for potential disruption of gRNA structure by mFold (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/). If potential guides were predicted to form an appropriate ''handle'' to interact with Cas9 and were not predicted to form a tight hairpin that could potentially prevent interaction with the genome, then they were added to the finalized list of potential guides. Six guides were chosen for the experiment based on the criteria listed above. Three guides were located upstream of the start codon in exon 2, and three guides were located downstream of the start codon in exon 2 (Fig. 1) . The six guides and the PAM (bold) include TMPRSS2 Guide 1, AGACTGTAAAATTTC-CATACCGG, TMPRSS2 Guide 2, ATCAGGTACAG GTAAGTATTTGG, TMPRSS2 Guide 3, CCCTCAC CCAGAGAGCCTTCTGG, TMPRSS2 Guide 4, GG CTTTAAACTCAGTAGGTGG, TMPRSS2 Guide 5, GTTAATTATTACCTCCCTGG, TMPRSS2 Guide 6, GTGCCTTCTGTTAGTTCCAGCGG. The distances between the guides in each pair were 39 bp between 2 ? 4, 127 bp between 1 ? 5 and 222 bp between 3 ? 6 when measured from N to N in the NGG PAM sequence. Proximity to the start codon are shown in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "In vitro transcription of single guide RNAs for the CRISPR/Cas9 system Template guide DNA was first synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies in the form of a gBlock (Supplemental Table 1 ). A T7 promoter sequence was added upstream of the guide for in vitro transcription. Each gBlock was diluted to final concentration 0.1 ng/ ll and PCR amplified with a gBlock F (ACTGG-CACCTATGCGGGACGAC) and a gBlock R primer (AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCAC) with Q5 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) following standard protocol. PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation of 98\u00b0C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C (10 s), 68\u00b0C (30 s) and 72\u00b0C (30 s). Each PCR amplified gBlock was purified by using a QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) PCR purification kit following standard protocol. Purified gBlock amplicons were then used as template for in vitro transcription by standard protocol with the MEGAshortscript (Ambion, Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY). Quality of the synthesized RNAs were visualized on a 2.0 % RNAfree agarose gel and concentrations 260:280 ratios were determined via Nanodrop spectrophotometry. Capped and polyadenylated Cas9 mRNA was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 mRNA were diluted in nuclease-free water and combined at a final concentration of 20 and 20 ng/ll, respectively. sgRNA guides 1 and 5, sgRNA guides 2 and 4 and sgRNA guides 3 and 6 were each mixed together with Cas9. RNA aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C until zygote injection. For IVF, ovaries from pre-pubertal gilts were obtained from an abattoir (Smithfield-Farmland., Milan, MO). Immature oocytes were aspirated from medium size (3-6 mm) follicles by using an 18-gauge hypodermic needle attached to a 10 ml syringe. Oocytes with evenly dark cytoplasm and intact surrounding cumulus cells were then selected for maturation. Between 200 and 250 cumulus oocyte complexes were placed in a 35 mM petri dish (BD 35-1008) containing 2.0 ml of maturation medium, TCM 199 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with 3.05 mM glucose, 0.91 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.57 mM cysteine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.5 lg/ml luteinizing hormone (LH), 0.5 lg/ml follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), 10 ng/ml gentamicin (APP Pharm, Schaumburg, IL), and 0.1 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for 42-44 h at 38.5\u00b0C, 5 % CO 2 , in humidified air. At the end of the maturation, the surrounding cumulus cells were removed from the oocytes by vortexing for 3 min in the presence of 0.1 % hyaluronidase. Then in vitro matured oocytes were placed in 50 ll droplets of IVF medium (modified Tris-buffered medium with 113.1 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 7.5 mM CaCl 2 , 11 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris, 2 mM caffeine, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, and 2 mg/ml BSA) in groups of 25-30 oocytes. One 100 ll frozen semen pellet was thawed in 3 ml of DPBS supplemented with 0.1 % BSA. Either frozen wild type was washed in 45 % percoll for 20 min at 5509g and in MTBM for 10 min by centrifugation. The semen pellet was then resuspended with IVF medium to 0.5 9 10 6 cells/ml. Fifty microliter of the semen suspension was introduced into the droplets with oocytes. The gametes were co-incubated for 5 h at 38.5\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air. After fertilization, the embryos were incubated in MU2 (Bauer et al. 2010; Yoshioka et al. 2002) at 38.5\u00b0C, 5 % CO 2 in air atmosphere.",

The authors had observed a tendency for male offspring in a previous experiment that utilized CRISPR/Cas9 zygote injection and wanted to confirm that female embryos were not more sensitive to potential adverse effects of modification by this technique (Whitworth et al. 2014) . In this set of experiments, there was no significant effect of zygote injection of CRISPR/Cas9 RNA on rate of development to blastocyst stage. Additionally the sex ratio was not different in edited zygotes on day 5, 6 or 7 of embryo culture. DNA editing by CRISPR/Cas9 is a highly embryo culture dependent technique and despite this necessity, very little research has been done to determine how modification of the DNA by this method affects the resulting embryos. It has been shown previously that overall blastocyst rates are not adversely affected by injection (Hai et al. 2014; Wang Fig. 2 Genotyping results for the small deletions assay and long range assay for TMPRSS2 DNA edited piglets in litter 3 (a, c) and 37 (b, d). e An example of a zygote being injected with CRISPR/Cas9 RNA. f Healthy TMPRSS2 DNA edited pig et al. 2015). One group did utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out the pluripotency marker POU5F1 and showed that early blastocyst formation was not affected, but POUF1 was necessary for proper inner cell mass formation (Kwon et al. 2015) . The lack of measurable effect on the rate of embryo development and sex ratio further validates that this technique does not have a toxic effect on the resulting embryos. The authors acknowledge that the sample size was somewhat low and this set of RNA guides were particularly efficient in creating INDELS. A skewing of the sex ratio at the blastocyst stage was not observed in this series of experiments, but it has been shown previously that male and female embryos do respond differently to in vitro culture. Male and female bovine embryos have different metabolic requirements and male embryos have been shown to reach first-cleavage stages earlier than female embryos (Lonergan et al. 1999) . In vitro cultured human male embryos also have higher cell numbers at day 6 when compared to their female counterparts (Ray et al. 1995) . In the mouse, in vitro cultured male embryos have increased cell numbers by day 3 of culture when compared to female embryos. Interestingly the same study showed that in vivo derived female mouse embryos compact earlier than male embryos, further illustrating the differential effect of culture on the sex ratios of embryos (Peippo and Bredbacka 1995) .",

In 6 of the pigs, exon 2 was successfully deleted on at least one allele and would be expected to have a knock-out phenotype. It appeared that CRISPR guides 4, 5 and 6 were very efficient in producing INDELS by non-homologous end join repair (NHEJ) ( Table 4 ), but these guides were located in the intron preceding the targeted exon 2. If RNA splicing was not disrupted by these edits, the pigs would be expected to have normal expression of TMPRSS2 and no phenotype. As detailed in Fig. 1 , the RNA guide pairs were spaced at 3 different distances from each other, 39 bp between 2 ? 4, 127 bp between 1 ? 5 and 222 bp between 3 ? 6. The experiment was originally designed to test the efficiency of designed deletions with CRISPR guides at 3 different proximal locations. RNA guides 4, 5 and 6 clearly functioned at a higher efficiency as most INDELs were located in proximity to these guides. A comparison of distance between guides could not be systematically evaluated unless all of the guides functioned at the same efficiency. However, of the four observed designed deletions, pair 3 ? 6 (222 bp) was most effective and resulted in 3 designed deletions.",

The offspring will be an important tool to address the role of the swine TMPRSS2 protease in swine influenza pathogenesis. Since cleavage of the influenza hemagglutinin by host proteases is essential for the infectivity of influenza viruses (Hatesuer et al. 2013; Tarnow et al. 2014 ), a TMPRSS2 biallelic knock-out pig should be resistant to various influenza viruses. As observed so far, the knock-out pigs do not show a distinct phenotype, suggesting functional redundancy in the pig. The production of swine resistant to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) would not only benefit the pork industry which suffers significant economic losses associated with SIV infections, but also public health, since many SIVs have zoonotic potential and swine are considered the ''mixing vessel'' for the making of novel reassortant influenza viruses (Ma et al. 2009 ). In addition, since TMPRSS2 plays a role in the activation of the fusion proteins of influenza B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, and coronaviruses (Tarnow et al. 2014 ), a TMPRSS2 knock-out pig might be a useful model to study the role of host proteases in the pathogenesis of these respiratory infections.",

Small INDEL Assay: Small INDELs were determined by PCR amplification of the TMPRSS2 gene in a region flanking the projected cutting site introduced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system with primers TMPRSS2 F1 and TMPRSS2 R2. PCR conditions of the small INDELs assays consisted of an initial denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C (30 s), 56\u00b0C (30 s) and 72\u00b0C (1 min). Insertions and deletions (INDELs) were identified by separating PCR amplicons by agarose gel electrophoresis. The resulting PCR products were also Sanger DNA sequenced with primer TMPRSS2 F1 at the University of Missouri DNA Core. Chromatographs were analyzed for the presence of INDELS in Finch TV (Perkin Elmer Waltham, Massachusetts). Medium Range Assay: Medium sized INDELs were evaluated by PCR amplification of the TMPRSS2 gene with primers TMPRSS2 2156F and TMPRSS2 6149 R. PCR conditions of the medium INDEL assays consisted of an initial denaturation of 94\u00b0C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C (30 s), 50\u00b0C (30 s) and 68\u00b0C (5 min). Insertions and deletions (INDELs) were identified by separating PCR amplicons by agarose gel electrophoresis. The medium range assay was not further evaluated by Sanger Sequencing. Long Range Assay: Large INDELs were evaluated by PCR amplification of TMPRSS2 gene with primers TMPRSS2 3968 F and TMPRSS2 6149 R. PCR conditions of the large INDEL assays consisted of an initial denaturation of 94\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C (30 s), 50\u00b0C (30 s) and 68\u00b0C (5 min).
