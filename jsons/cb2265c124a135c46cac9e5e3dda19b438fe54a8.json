The characteristics of abdominal trauma patients with poor outcomes related to obesity require evaluation. We hypothesize that obesity is related to increased mortality and length of stay (LOS) among abdominal trauma patients undergoing laparotomies. Methods Abdominal trauma patients were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank between 2013 and 2015. Patients who received laparotomies were analyzed using propensity score matching (PSM) to evaluate the mortality rate and LOS between obese and non-obese patients. Patients without laparotomies were analyzed as a control group using PSM cohort analysis. Results A total of 33,798 abdominal trauma patients were evaluated, 10,987 of them received laparotomies. Of these patients, the proportion of obesity in deceased patients was significantly higher when compared to the survivors (33.1% vs. 26.2%, p \\ 0.001). Elevation of one kg/m 2 of body mass index independently resulted in 2.5% increased odds of mortality. After a well-balanced PSM, obese patients undergoing laparotomies had significantly higher mortality rates [3.7% vs. 2.4%, standardized difference (SD) = 0.241], longer hospital LOS (11.1 vs. 9.6 days, SD = 0.135), and longer intensive care unit LOS (3.5 vs. 2.3 days, SD = 0.171) than non-obese patients undergoing laparotomies.",

First, a one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) methodology was used to minimize selection bias between patients with laparotomies who were obese and non-obese, and constructed pairs of obese patients and non-obese patients with the greedy neighbor approach. A caliper setting of 0.1 was utilized [22] . Standardized differences (SD) were used to confirm a balanced matching result. The matching result was considered balanced when SD was less than 0.1 ( Fig. 1 , Table 2 ) [23] . After a well-balanced matching, outcomes between obese and non-obese patients were compared (Table 3) . A similar PSM was performed in obese and nonobese patients without laparotomies as a control.",

In patients who received laparotomies, the obese had a higher mortality rate (3.7% vs. 2.4%, SD = 0.241), longer hospital LOS (11.1 vs. 9.6 days, SD = 0.135), and longer ICU LOS (3.5 vs. 2.3 days, SD = 0.171) than the non-obese after matching. However, there was no significant difference in mortality rate, hospital LOS, or ICU LOS between the SBP systolic blood pressure, ED emergency department, RR respiratory rate, GCS Glasgow coma scale, ISS injury severity score, BMI body mass index, CI confidence interval obese and non-obese in patients who did not receive laparotomy after matching (Table 3 ). In addition to PSM, a MLR analysis showed that in 10,987 patients who received laparotomies, obesity serves as an independent factor to mortality (odds ratio: 1.317, 95% CI: 1.013-1.712, p = 0.040) after adjusting for age, gender (male), SBP, pulse, RR, GCS, trauma mechanism (penetrating trauma), transportation time, ED time, comorbidity, use of transfusion, and ISS (Table 4) . A similar adjusted regression model was also performed in patients who did not receive a laparotomy (N = 22,811) as a control group.

Patients undergoing a laparotomy may suffer a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, secondary pneumonia, urinary retention, or a reaction to anesthesia [27, 28] . Among patients requiring surgical intervention, obesity is a significant risk factor for surgical wound infections, increased surgical blood loss, and an increased operative time [8-10, 15, 16] . Surgical complications as well as mortality may be increased in obese patients. Therefore, the deleterious role of obesity seems magnified in patients subjected to surgical stress. In obese trauma patients who receive operations, several complications are reported including pneumothorax or hemothorax related to central catheter placement, surgical site infection, surgical wound dehiscence, failure of surgical anastomoses, and increased ventilator days. It is reasonable to assume that more obese individuals have more complications and the cumulative effect of increased complications in operative intervention leads to increased mortality [29] .",
