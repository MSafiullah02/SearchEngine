The significant increase in HAdV-7 infection between 2010 and 2011 represents an undetected outbreak in local children, which is consistent with the reported outbreaks in Chongqing (China).15,16 However, in provinces of mainland China, such as Hangzhou30 and Jiangsu, 35 most respiratory disease outbreaks were associated with HAdV-3 infection. From 2012 to 2014, HAdV-7 was the dominant HAdV infection type in Hunan. HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infections result in severe pneumonia, and HAdV-7 infection is found in children at a young age and results in epidemic outbreaks with high mortality and severe sequelae. 6,17,18 Studies from the United States (2004-2006) suggest that HAdV-7 infection has not been implicated to have a strong association with severe morbidity possibly because of a stabilization of circulating HAdV-7 genotypes in the United States, as was recently apparent in Iowa for the adenovirus type 7d2 strain, with subsequent increases in herd immunity and reductions in HAdV-7 infections. 23 A Korean (1997-2007) report suggested that the intensity of outbreaks caused by HAdV-7 decreased markedly and did not circulate endemically. Because the HAdV-7 genome types were relatively limited in Korea, stabilization of the circulating HAdV-7 genome types and the subsequent increase in herd immunity might have resulted in the decline of HAdV-7 activity in Korea. 39 By contrast, HAdV-7 infection is a major cause of LRTIs in children in China. 32 There was a high frequency of infection of HAdV-7 and HAdV-3 in pediatric pneumonia in Chongqing and Beijing, and HAdV-7 infection was associated with a higher incidence of severe pneumonia, 15,40 which reinforces the findings of the current study.

With only six confirmedHAdV-55 cases, it is difficult to analyze its clinical effect. The longterm surveillance of specific types of HAdV that can cause human infections is important, especially for newly identified genotypes, as an exploration of their clinical effect is much needed.The most common clinical ALRTI diagnosis was pneumonia (85.0%), followed by bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Most patients showed mild symptoms with good prognosis. Fever and cough were the most common manifestations of HAdV infection, which was consistent with previous studies.6 HAdV-7 infection was associated with a higher fatality rate than HAdV-3 infection, which was consistent with previous reports.[17][18][19][20] HAdV infection, particularly HAdV-7 infection, was strongly associated with severe morbidity, including required supplemental oxygen, an increased ICU stay, and a relatively longer hospitalization.6,[15][16][17][18] In this surveillance study, patients with HAdV-7 infection alone presented more severe pneumonia, relatively longer hospital stay, and more frequent transfer to the ICU compared with those in patients with HAdV-3 infection alone (all P < 0.05).The rate of coinfection by HAdV and other respiratory viruses is high in patients with HAdV infection.41,42 We found that the rate of coinfection of HAdV and other respiratory viruses was 62.0% (173 of 279), which was similar to a report from Israel.41 Comparative studies revealed similar epidemiological and clinical features among patients infected with HAdV and those coinfected with HAdV and another respiratory virus. Similar to our findings, Foulongne et al reported that the hospital stay increased in hMPV/RSV coinfected children compared with those infected by one type of virus. 43 However, some studies have reported that there are no clinical differences between patients with respiratory infections caused by one type of agent and those caused by multiple viruses detected in NPAs from hospitalized children. 44,45 From an empirical point of view, it might be logical to expect that infection with two or more types of viruses could aggravate the severity of illness; we believe that studies should focus on dual versus multiple infections as the different characteristics of the virus can cause a bias when analyzing the results. One report has indicated that the detection of viral load in respiratory specimens may be helpful for possible progress in identifying the true respiratory pathogen and may serve as an important clue to determine the virus that may have a greater influence on the clinical severity of the illness in a mixed infection. 46 As a result, further studies are needed.This study has several limitations. First, it was a single-center study and the results may not be generalized to other settings.Second, our experiments did not determine the severity of other confounding factors, such as virus combinations, that could affect outcomes. Further, this study may also suffer from a selection bias as it did not include patients who consulted outpatient departments.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors declared that there are no conflicts of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST"}, {"text": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1513-7769", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lili Zhong"}]}
