            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that are responsible for devastating illnesses in livestock and domestic animals. The identification of a novel human coronavirus as the etiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted the potential of this virus family to also cause severe human disease (Kuiken et al., 2003). Even with continuing research addressing how coronaviruses replicate and cause disease, the functions of many viral proteins remain to be elucidated. For example, 14\u201316 nonstructural proteins (nsps) are expressed from coronavirus gene 1 polyproteins, but at least seven of these nsps have no known roles in viral replication. In the past, gene 1 has been referred to as the \u201creplicase gene\u201d and gene 1 nsps as \u201creplicase proteins\u201d named by their molecular weight in kilodaltons. More recently, nsps have been named based on their order in gene 1 and are numbered consecutively beginning at the amino-terminus of the polyprotein (i.e., nsp1 through nsp16) (Harcourt et al., 2004, Prentice et al., 2004b, Snijder et al., 2003). The gene 1 nsps of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) are similar in number, size, and organization to those of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Marra et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). This resemblance suggests that MHV is an excellent model for studies of coronavirus nsp function and may increase our understanding of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Following entry of MHV into a host cell, the first event in the virus life cycle is translation of two polyproteins from gene 1 of the input RNA genome. Gene 1 is comprised of two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are connected by a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (Fig. 1A) (Bonilla et al., 1994, Bredenbeek et al., 1990, Brierley et al., 1989, Lee et al., 1991, Pachuk et al., 1989). Translation of either ORF1a or the ORF1ab fusion results in possible 495-kDa or 803-kDa polyproteins, respectively. These co-amino-terminal polyproteins are proteolytically processed by three virus-encoded proteinases, including two papain-like proteinases (PLP1 and PLP2 within nsp3) and a picoronavirus 3C-like proteinase (nsp5), to yield at least 16 mature gene 1 nsps as well as intermediate precursors. To date, all MHV gene 1 nsps tested co-localize with sites of active viral RNA synthesis at cytoplasmic viral replication complexes on intracellular double-membrane vesicles (Bost et al., 2000, Bost et al., 2001, Brockway et al., 2003, Brockway et al., 2004, Gosert et al., 2002, Prentice et al., 2004a, Shi et al., 1999, van der Meer et al., 1999). Nsps are thought to mediate replication of the MHV RNA genome and subgenomic RNA synthesis at these membrane-bound complexes. However, the viral proteinases are the only MHV nsps with experimentally confirmed functions (Baker et al., 1989, Bonilla et al., 1995, Lu et al., 1996, Lu et al., 1995). Based on homology to proteins with known functions, roles in viral RNA synthesis have been predicted for several other MHV gene 1 nsps. These proteins include two trans-membrane scaffolding proteins (nsp4 and nsp6) (Gosert et al., 2002), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) (Cheng et al., 2005, Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Lee et al., 1991), an RNA helicase (nsp13) (Seybert and Ziebuhr, 2001, Seybert et al., 2000), and several RNA processing enzymes (nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16) (Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Ivanov et al., 2004, Thiel et al., 2003, Ziebuhr, 2005). Currently, there are no known or envisaged functions in replication for at least seven MHV gene 1 proteins (nsp1, nsp2, and nsp7\u201311).",

            "text": "Previous studies have provided intriguing evidence about the potential functions of the 28-kDa amino-terminal protein nsp1 (previously referred to as p28) in MHV replication. The kinetics of nsp1 expression suggest that it might have an early regulatory role during the viral life cycle. Nsp1 is the first mature protein processed from the gene 1 polyprotein and is likely cleaved quickly following translation of PLP1 within nsp3 (Baker et al., 1989, Baker et al., 1993, Denison and Perlman, 1987, Denison and Perlman, 1986, Denison et al., 1992, Denison et al., 1995). MHV mutants that are incapable of liberating nsp1 from the nascent polyprotein exhibit delayed replication, diminished peak titers, small plaques, and reduced RNA synthesis compared to wild-type controls (Denison et al., 2004). These results emphasize the importance of nsp1 cleavage for optimal viral RNA synthesis and suggest that nsp1 might play an important role at MHV replication complexes. In support of this notion, nsp1 localizes to replication complexes in the infected cell cytoplasm during times of peak viral RNA synthesis, and biochemical experiments demonstrate interactions between nsp1 and two other replication complex-associated proteins (nsp7 and nsp10) (Brockway et al., 2004). However, later in infection, nsp1 is distinct from replication complexes and instead co-localizes with MHV structural proteins at virion assembly sites (Brockway et al., 2004). It has also been reported that exogenous MHV nsp1 expression induces cell-cycle arrest (Chen et al., 2004). Together, these results led to the hypothesis that nsp1 may participate in multiple stages of the MHV life cycle. Still, the function of this protein remains a mystery as analysis of nsp1 primary amino acid sequence does not reveal common motifs or protein homologs, and the nsp1 crystal structure has not been solved.",

Using the reverse genetic system for MHV developed by Yount et al. (2002), genomic RNA molecules that contained deletions or point mutations within the nsp1-coding region were generated and tested for their capacity to produce infectious virus following transfection into permissive cells. The results demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 is dispensable for replication in culture but is important for efficient proteolytic cleavage of the protein and optimal viral replication. In contrast, deletion of the entire nsp1 protein or a middle region of the protein resulted in the lack of virus recovered from electroporated cells. Analysis of nsp1 point mutants identified residues important for viral replication and RNA synthesis. The results of this study provide valuable information regarding the possible functions of the amino-terminal nsp1 protein in coronavirus replication.",

Clarified cell culture media harvested from cells electroporated with either icwt or nsp1\u0394C RNA were capable of initiating a productive infection in freshly inoculated DBT-9 cells, demonstrating the presence of viable virus.

Migration of VUSB7-nsp1 differed from icwt and all other point mutants, suggesting differences in protein folding or charge. No 28-kDa proteins were immunoprecipitated from mock-infected cell lysates or from lysates generated from cells infected with the nsp1\u0394C virus (Fig. 3A). Rather, from nsp1\u0394C-infected cell lysate, \u03b1-nsp1 immunoprecipitated a unique 14-kDa protein, the predicted size of nsp1\u0394C, as well as a previously undescribed 80-kDa protein (Fig. 3A). In both VUSB4- and nsp1\u0394C-infected cells, several additional proteins (30 to 60 kDa) of unknown identity were also precipitated using \u03b1-nsp1 (Fig. 3A). Antisera against nsp2 (\u03b1-nsp2) immunoprecipitated a 65-kDa protein (nsp2) from all infected cell lysates, but not from mock-infected lysates (Fig. 3B).

The nsp1 mutants showed band intensities slightly increased compared with icwt. The reason for this difference in band intensity is unknown but might be a reflection of more protein synthesis or processing with the mutants at the time of label. Still, although the amount of protein detected differed slightly, the results show that amino-terminal nsp1 point mutants do not have defects in their capacities to express or process viral proteins. Nonetheless, the detection of an 80-kDa protein from nsp1\u0394C-infected cells using either \u03b1-nsp1 or \u03b1-nsp2 suggests that cleavage of nsp1\u0394C from nsp2 may be inefficient.",

Deletion of different portions of the nsp1 amino-terminal half, as was done with nsp1\u0394FL and nsp1\u0394Mid, was not tolerated for virus viability. This result is consistent with the idea that critical replication determinants reside within the region spanning residues M1 through P123. Charge-to-alanine mutagenesis identified four candidate residues (R64 and E69 with VUSB5; R78 and D79 with VUSB6), all or any of which may be vital for some stage of the MHV life cycle. In cells transfected with RNA genomes for these non-productive mutants (nsp1\u0394FL, nsp1\u0394Mid, VUSB5, or VUSB6), foci containing 5\u201310 cell nuclei were seen. How these foci form in electroporated cell monolayers is unknown, but the presence of this CPE suggests that transient viral gene expression may have occurred. However, no viral protein was detected in transfected cell monolayers by immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence assays, and RT-PCR did not amplify subgenomic RNA, indicating that, if gene expression occurred, it was below the limits of detection using these assays. Consequently, the exact stage of the MHV life cycle at which these mutant viruses are blocked could not be determined. Still, the result that nsp1\u0394FL, nsp1\u0394Mid, VUSB5, or VUSB6 did not establish productive infections underscores the importance of the nsp1 amino-terminus and suggests that this protein has a critical function during viral replication.",

VUSB1 and VUSB4 were the most defective and resulted in viral titers approximately 0.2- to 1.3-log reduced compared with icwt. These two viruses also exhibited small plaque phenotypes, suggesting defects in cell-to-cell spread. The reduced replication and small plaques seen with VUSB1 and VUSB4 are most likely a reflection of reduced viral gene expression as both of these nsp1 point mutants showed significantly lower levels of viral RNA. Interestingly, compared with icwt, VUSB3 had increased levels of viral RNA associated with a slight reduction in viral replication, suggesting that any deviation from wild-type viral RNA levels may negatively impact viral replication. There were no detectable differences in the ratios of genome RNA versus subgenomic RNAs for any of the viable nsp1 mutants. These results suggest that nsp1 might play a role in the regulation of total viral RNA amounts rather than in species-specific viral RNA synthesis. It has been previously shown that MHV mutants unable to liberate nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein (\u0394CS1 mutants) exhibit phenotypes very similar to the nsp1 mutant viruses described in this study (Denison et al., 2004). Because the \u0394CS1 mutations resulted in a noncleaved nsp1-nsp2 fusion protein, it could not be concluded that the viral phenotypes were solely related to defects in nsp1 function. This study corroborates and extends these previous findings and directly correlates mutations in the MHV nsp1-coding region with changes in viral replication and RNA synthesis.",

Why is the nsp1 amino-terminus required for MHV replication? What function does this domain have during MHV RNA synthesis? Do the deletion and point mutations change the nature of nsp1\u2013protein interactions? Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays previously demonstrated that wild-type nsp1 directly binds to nsp7 and nsp10, two other gene 1 proteins (Brockway et al., 2004). The interactions between nsp1, nsp7, and nsp10 do not require the nsp1 carboxy-terminus (F167 through G247) but do require residues amino-terminal to F167 (i.e., residues E84 through R166). Because the nsp1\u0394Mid virus was engineered to lack this putative interaction domain, it is interesting to speculate whether the lack of viability for this mutant correlates with a loss of nsp1 binding to either nsp7 and/or nsp10. Furthermore, it is thought that charge-to-alanine mutagenesis alters a protein's capacity to participate in inter- and intra-molecular interactions (Cunningham and Wells, 1989). This mutagenesis approach is supposed to minimize disruption of protein secondary structure; however, it is possible that some of the charge-to-alanine mutations caused nsp1 to misfold. In support of this possibility, VUSB1-nsp1 was detected by \u03b1-nsp1 antisera during immunoprecipitation assays but not during immunofluorescence assays, suggesting that this mutant protein may have a different structural conformation. Regardless, the introduced mutations may have altered the capacity of nsp1 to bind to nsp7, nsp10, or other proteins resulting in viral RNA synthesis and viral replication defects.",

Immediately following translation of PLP1 within nsp3, CS1 is rapidly cleaved, releasing nsp1 as polyprotein synthesis continues (Denison et al., 1992, Denison et al., 1995, Harcourt et al., 2004, Schiller et al., 1998). Next, cleavage site 3 (CS3) is cleaved (likely by PLP2) liberating an nsp2\u2013nsp3 precursor, which is finally processed at cleavage site 2 (CS2) to release mature nsp2 and nsp3 products (Denison et al., 1992, Denison et al., 1995, Harcourt et al., 2004, Schiller et al., 1998). In nsp1\u0394C virus-infected cells, nsp1\u0394C (14-kDa) and nsp2 are present, demonstrating that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 is not absolutely essential for cleavage at either CS1 or CS2. However, the identification of an 80-kDa nsp1\u0394C\u2013nsp2 polypeptide in nsp1\u0394C virus-infected cells reveals that this region of the protein (residues K124 through L241) is important for efficient CS1 processing.",

If the mutant polyprotein is folded in such a manner that CS1 is accessible by the proteinase, then this site is cleaved normally and the mutant polyprotein follows a wild-type pattern of processing (Fig. 7B). Alternatively, if the mutant polyprotein is folded in a way that masks CS1, this site is not processed and nsp1\u0394C remains fused to nsp2 (Fig. 7C). In this model, an nsp1\u0394C\u2013nsp2\u2013nsp3 precursor is the first processed protein following CS3 cleavage. This polypeptide is then processed at CS2 to yield the 80-kDa protein (nsp1\u0394C\u2013nsp2) and nsp3. Although the high molecular weight precursors were not detected in these studies, the kinetics of appearance for nsp1\u0394C, nsp2, and the 80-kDa protein are compatible with the proposed model. During pulse-chase experiments, nsp1\u0394C and nsp2 are first detected in nsp1\u0394C virus-infected cells with the same timing as the corresponding nsp1 and nsp2 proteins in icwt-infected cells. However, the expression kinetics for the 80-kDa protein are unlike either nsp1 or nsp2, suggesting that the timing and order of polyprotein processing are different under circumstances where CS1 is not immediately cleaved. Whether the 80-kDa protein is capable of being subsequently processed into nsp1\u0394C and nsp2 could not be determined from these studies. At extended times p.c. (360 min), the 80-kDa protein is still detectable, albeit at slightly reduced levels, and there is no new accumulation of nsp1\u0394C at this same time. These data are most consistent with the idea that the 80-kDa protein is not further processed once it is generated.",

A unique RNA species migrating above RNA4 was detected in nsp1\u0394C-infected cells. The identity of this RNA band remains to be determined, but it might represent a stable replicative intermediate and implies that this mutant virus may have minor defects in discontinuous transcription. Another interesting possibility is that this band might represent a new species of subgenomic RNA. Because some molecules of nsp1\u0394C are fused to nsp2, defects in nsp2 function may contribute to the mutant viral phenotype. Alternatively, the reduced replication of the nsp1\u0394C virus might suggest that nsp1 plays an important role downstream of viral RNA synthesis, such as in virion assembly. At late times of infection, wild-type nsp1 co-localizes with the MHV structural protein M at virion assembly sites (Brockway et al., 2004). Because the \u03b1-nsp1 antisera used in this study also detects the 80-kDa nsp1\u0394C\u2013nsp2 protein, we were unable to precisely determine whether the 14-kDa nsp1\u0394C protein is capable of localizing to virion assembly sites late in infection. Nonetheless, it will be valuable to determine whether nsp1\u0394C, or any of the mutant nsp1 proteins, exhibit differences in protein localization during late times of infection.",

            "text": "In summary, the phenotypes of these MHV mutant viruses reveal new information about the possible roles of nsp1 during viral replication. However, it is important to note the limitations of the reverse genetic approach used in this study and to explore alternative explanations of the available data. For example, it has been reported that exogenous MHV nsp1 expression induces cell-cycle arrest (Chen et al., 2004). Therefore, it is also possible that the nsp1 mutations have an indirect effect on MHV replication as a result of cell biological changes during infection. Moreover, while it is clear that some of the nsp1 mutants have differences in nsp1 confirmation and interactions, it is possible that uncharacterized RNA structural elements have also been disrupted as a result of nsp1 mutagenesis resulting in changes in viral RNA synthesis and replication. Furthermore, in the absence of sequencing the entire 32-kb genomes of the nsp1 mutant viruses, the possibility that other mutations contribute to the described phenotypes cannot be excluded. To rule out the contributions of other mutations or RNA elements, wild-type nsp1 expressed in cells must complement the defects of these viruses. While ideal, trans-complementation using protein expression has not been successful for coronaviruses. In fact, efficient complementation for other positive-strand RNA viruses has required the development of replicon systems to facilitate viral replication complex formation (Appel et al., 2005, Grassmann et al., 2001, Khromykh et al., 1998, Lindenbach and Rice, 1997, Liu et al., 2002). Despite these limitations, this is the first report of detailed mutagenesis of an MHV gene 1 nsp-coding region within the context of a virus. These results will enhance our knowledge of MHV replication determinants, and future analysis of nsp1 mutant viruses will provide greater insight into the function of RNA and protein elements within the 5\u2032 end of gene 1. Even more, studies with these engineered mutant viruses are expected to contribute to understanding the replication strategies of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV.",

All assembled viruses, including the wild-type control (icwt), were generated using the icMHV fragment F plasmid corresponding to the virulent VUSS3 strain (Sperry et al., 2005). Plasmids containing the cDNA cassettes of the MHV genome were digested using MluI and BsmBI for fragment A, BglI and BsmBI for fragments B and C, NciI and BsmBI for fragments D and E, BsmBI for F, and SfiI and BsmBI for fragment G. Gel purified restriction fragments were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in a total reaction volume of 150 \u03bcl at 16 \u00b0C overnight. Following chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation of ligated cDNA, full-length transcripts of icMHV RNA were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. Fifty microliter reactions were supplemented with 7.5 \u03bcl of 30 mM GTP, and transcription was performed at 40.5 \u00b0C for 25 min, 37.5 \u00b0C for 50 min, and 40.5 \u00b0C for 25 min. In parallel, RNA transcripts encoding the MHV nucleocapsid protein (N) were generated from N cDNA. N transcripts and icMHV genomic RNA were then mixed and electroporated into BHK-MHVR cells. Briefly, BHK-MHVR cells were grown to sub-confluence, trypsinized, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS at 107 cells/ml. Six hundred microliters cells were then added to RNA transcripts in a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette, and three electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 \u03bcF were delivered with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were then seeded on a monolayer of 106 uninfected DBT-9 cells in a 150 cm2 flask and incubated at either 37 \u00b0C or 32 \u00b0C for 24 to 96 h. Virus viability was determined by syncytia formation in the electroporated cell culture and by the capacity of the clarified transfected cell supernatant to induce syncytia in a monolayer of fresh DBT-9 cells.",

Actinomycin D was added to a final concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml 30 min prior to the addition of [3H]uridine. Viral RNA was radiolabeled from 5\u20139 h p.i. and then precipitated from equal volumes of cytoplasmic lysates in replicate using trichloracetic acid. To quantitate [3H]uridine incorporation as counts per minute (CPM), liquid scintillation was used. For each experiment (n = 5), labeled viral RNA levels (CPM) for icwt were set to 100%, and nsp1 mutant viral RNA was calculated as a percentage of the icwt value. The bars represent the average percent viral RNA from all experiments, and lines indicate standard error. Statistical analysis software was used to determine P values using a one-sample t test. Asterisks (*) indicate P values \u2264 0.05. (B) Gel analysis of viral RNA. DBT-9 cells were mock-infected or infected with icwt or the indicated nsp1 mutants. RNA was labeled as in panel (A) above, and cells were lysed using Trizol. RNA was isolated from cell lysates and normalized so as to electrophorese the same amount of radiolabeled viral RNA for each mutant (approximately 400,000 CPM from a maximum of 106 cells). For the mock-infected control (m), RNA from 106 cells was used. The RNA was separated in an 0.8% formaldehyde/agarose gels and individual RNA species were visualized following fluorography. The image is from a 2-day exposure of the gel to film. Individual viral RNA species are numbered to the right of the fluorogram (RNA 1 = genome and RNA 2\u20137 = subgenomic RNAs).

PLP1 and PLP2 are shown as gray boxes within nsp3. The individual cleavage sites are labeled, and the order of processing is indicated above the closed arrowheads. Lines below the protein schematics illustrate the size of mature proteins following cleavage at individual sites. (A) Processing of wild-type nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. During infection, nsp1 (28 kDa) is cleaved rapidly at cleavage site 1 (CS1) as the polyprotein is translated (indicated by forward slashes). Next, cleavage site 3 (CS3) is processed to yield a 275-kDa nsp2\u2013nsp3 precursor. Finally, cleavage site 2 (CS2) is cleaved to liberate nsp2 (65 kDa) and nsp3 (210 kDa). (B) Wild-type pattern of processing for nsp1\u0394C mutant. The order of cleavage for nsp1\u0394C mutant polyprotein is identical to that of icwt. Nsp1\u0394C protein (\u0394C; 14 kDa) is liberated by CS1 cleavage. Next, CS3 is processed to yield a 275-kDa nsp2\u2013nsp3 precursor. Finally, CS2 is cleaved to liberate nsp2 (65 kDa) and nsp3 (210 kDa). (C) Alternative pattern of processing for nsp1\u0394C mutant. If CS1 is not initially cleaved, a 290-kDa nsp1\u0394C\u2013nsp2\u2013nsp3 precursor is made following CS3 processing. This precursor is then cleaved at CS2 to yield an 80-kDa protein (nsp1\u0394C\u2013nsp2) and nsp3.",
