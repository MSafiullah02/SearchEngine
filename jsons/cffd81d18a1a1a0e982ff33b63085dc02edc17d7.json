Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its airborne spread via droplets. The impact of environmental factors on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is under consideration. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the impact of environmental factors on human coronaviruses. Temperature, humidity and other environmental factors have been recorded as environmental drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and in other countries. Higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. In our review, the analysis of 23 studies show evidence that high temperature and high humidity reduce the COVID-19 transmission. However, further studies concerning other environmental (namely meteorological) factors' role should be conducted in order to further prove this correlation.",

Approximately ten years after SARS, another novel, highly pathogenic CoV, in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel CoV, was identified in the City of Wuhan, Hubei Province, a major transport hub of central China. The earliest COVID-19 cases were linked to a large seafood market in Wuhan, initially suggesting a direct food source transmission pathway this is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus that has emerged in the last two decades.",

Taking into consideration that the new coronavirus is a new human pathogen, which due to its outbreak in China and its rapid spread worldwide, it is important to understand reliable epidemiological information for its survival in the environment (Chen et al. 2020) . Therefore, it is necessary to find prognostic predictors to distinguish high-risk areas or countries and improve the new (Bu et al. 2020) . Concerning humidity, although the results in this review did not reveal robust associations between humidity and coronavirus survival and are always validated in combination with temperature, they need to be interpreted carefully given the monotonic functional relationship between humidity and temperature.

Mao et al. concluded that temperature has a non-linear dose response relationship with COVID-19 transmission, whereas there is a specific temperature range, in which virus transmission is facilitated and this might also explain the emergence of the epidemic in Wuhan city. Wang et al. suggest that regions with lower temperature records should take even stricter measures in order to prevent future outbreaks (Wang et al. 2020). Luo et al. and Poirier et al. suggest that changes in weather conditions alone, namely increase of humidity and temperature (which are usually met in spring and summer seasons) may not suffice to decrease the number of cases, if no proper public health interventions are adopted (Luo et al. 2020) (Poirier et al. 2020). Bonilla-Aldana et al. propose that temperature, rainfall and humidity may play a significant role in the virus transmission, as occurs for many zoonotic diseases (Bonilla-Aldana, Dhama, and Rodriguez-Morales 2020). Dietz et al. combined current literature and built environment and assessed its role in COVID-19 transmission, suggesting that built environment plays a significant role in the disease control and mediation and this may be taken into consideration in the building design market(Conraths et al. 2015). Oliveiros et al. regressed the doubling time of COVID-19 cases with the aid of temperature and humidity, whereas wind speed proved not be significantly associated (Oliveiros et al. 2020). Based on Shi et al. conclusions, lower and higher temperature rates may decrease the COVID-19 incidence rates and the role of absolute humidity has not yet been established (Shi et al. 2020). Lau et al. recorded an increase in the doubling time of COVID-cases and this was attributed to the lockdown measurements implemented (Lau et al. 2020). Chen et al. found out that the optimal temperature for COVID-19 is 8.07 \u00b0C, within a humidity range of 60-90% (Chen et al. 2020). Sun et al. concluded that cold and dry winter are considered as a common environmental condition conductive for COVID-19 (Sun et al. 2020).

Qu et al. linked the COVID-19 transmission with airborne dust (Qu et al. 2020). Gupta showed that for every 1\u00b0C increase above 5 \u00b0C, the temperature as factor may decrease the COVID-19 transmission rate by 10% (Gupta 2020). Cai et al. found no correlation between the daily mean temperature and the epidemic growth rate in case of Hunan or Wuhan, but insist that there is a weak correlation between the daily mean temperature and the mortality rates in both provinces (Cai et al. 2020). Chinazzi et al. assessed travel limitations practices applied in China and international scale and verified travel quarantine delayed the epidemic progression 3 to 5 days in China or more in worldwide basis (Chinazzi et al. 2020). Lee et al. reviewed Singapore's approach to COVID-19 epidemic concerning travel restrictions applied at all ports of entry (Lee, Chiew, and Khong 2020). Wang et al. propose that high temperature and high relative humidity significantly affects the COVID-19 transmission rates (J. Wang et al. 2020). Poole suggests that a climatological range of 4-12\u00b0C within an area of 25-55\u00b0 latitude may enhance the COVID-19 spread (Poole 2020). Bu et al. conclude that temperature rate of 13-19\u00b0C and humidity rate of 50-80% are conducive to the virus survival (Bu et al. 2020).",

The environmental factors such as meteorological factors, namely temperature and humidity proved to play a part in coronavirus outbreak besides the social factors (Jia et al. 2020). In our systematic review, overall evidence is sufficiently robust to determine the impact of temperature in virus' survival via different methods, like the effect of each 1\u00b0C increase which lowers the virus' R by 0.225 (J. Wang et al. 2020) and the doubling time of the confirmed cases which is positively correlated with temperature (Oliveiros et al. 2020). Four, studies included in this systematic review determine the exact temperature range, within which temperature is conducive to virus spread and survival. The pooled results of these 4 studies indicated that temperature range different from 4-24\u00b0C is not conducive to the survival of the coronavirus (M. Wang et al. 2020) (Sajadi, Habibzadeh, Vintzileos, Miralles-wilhelm, et al. 2020) (Poole 2020)",

Other factors concerned, such as air index, rainfall/precipitation, wind speed, do not show to have significant impact to virus stability and survival and need to be further assessed. Although not all environmental factors and not in depth are clearly described by authors of the included studies, important associations are observed and need further investigation. Variability in the results among the studies included in our review may be attributed to i) the utilization of different types of assessing methods of each environmental factor, ii) the different qualitative characteristics of the populations used, iii) sample size, iv) duration of the study and others. Environmental factors, characterized by lag effects and threshold effects, can target at two objects, host and virus, during infectious disease outbreak. On one hand, human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors. But the effect caused by environmental condition was limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme weather and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus. On the other hand, environmental impacts on the SARS-CoV-2 are more significant than the host population because the transmission and virulence of the virus varies in different conditions. Finally, environmental impacts on transmission of virus should be characterized in the dynamic model, because infectiousness estimated in the traditional dynamic model is actually a confounding effect with environmental effect. It is necessary to take account of environmental issues based on dynamic transmission model so that the impacts could be isolated and qualified.",
