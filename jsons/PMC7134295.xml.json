Aid was channeled through capital transfers and investment projects to overcome the capital shortage which hindered development in many nations. Several growth-oriented aid programs were initiated including poverty reduction, military development, educational upliftment, etc. [1]. The lack of countries\u2019 internal savings is one of the motivations for foreign aid donors to take part in the assistance. Over time, the focus of such aid has been changed to the macroeconomic stabilization, structural adjustment and debt reduction, political and economic transition, poverty reduction and social infrastructure. Past few decades, the donors started to put more emphasis on performance-based aid allocation, focusing on the global health, governance and security [2] and sustainable development goals. For the creation and development of sustainable and prosperous societies, all the actors in the society play an equally important role [3]. Foreign aid helping each sector of the societal development is an important factor for the attainment of sustainability and therefore the aid effectiveness has become a widespread topic of discussion.",

We investigate the aid effectiveness taking a case of Nepalese economy. Being one of the least developed countries in the world, Nepal is highly dependent on foreign aid. The country has been deploying foreign aid both as aid for budget support and non-budgetary aid for over six decades. However, the Ministry of Finance reports show that the share of foreign aid on the government\u2019s total budget has been declining by the improved mobilization of domestic resources which shows that the country is transforming into a self-reliant economy.",

One of the reasons for such disbursement could be that the real aim of granting aid to the recipient might not be to increase growth in many instances. \u201cPart of aid is disbursed to alleviate human disasters in the wake of natural catastrophes. Other parts might directly be granted to increase consumption of the poor in recipient countries\u201d The strategic interests of the donor have always been relevant in giving foreign aid [6]. The aid effectiveness study covering the period of 1983\u20132002 for Nepal has found that foreign aid has a positive and statistically significant effect on per capita real GDP in the long run but a negative impact in the short run. The aid effectiveness is increased in the presence of good policy environment [7]. Another recent contribution on the aid-growth literature for Nepal covers the period until 2008 which finds the similar results on aid effectiveness [8].",

Several cross-country panel estimations have found the evidence of positive aid effectiveness [10, 11]. Foreign aid, however, depends on the aid apparatus. The adaptability of foreign aid, availability, and know-how of the latest technology is something that needs to be considered for aid to be effective in future [5].

This somehow relaxes the government budget constraint. Aid, nonetheless, should not be used only to meet the non-development expenditures. Aid has a stronger positive impact on non-development expenditures than on development expenditures of Nepal [16]. Here we can get an idea that a greater portion of aid could have been used in non-development expenditures which typically do not help in the economic growth of a nation. According to the OECD data, we see that the percentage of grants on foreign aid to Nepal is more than the percentage of loans. Foreign grants mostly finance non-productive public expenditures while loans are used in public investment projects [9] therefore foreign loans can raise GDP, but grants don\u2019t.

The impact of aid on per capita real GDP is significantly positive in the long-run while taking the variable for capital and school enrolment in our existing model. This implies that, with the higher level of capital formation in-lined with enhanced technology and improved skills on human capital, foreign aid helps significantly to increase per capita real GDP in long-run. As shown in the second half of (Table 2) the significant negative error correction term indicates that any long-run disequilibrium is corrected within the current year at the adjustment speed of 2.8%. In the short-run, aid has a negative and significant coefficient which signifies that there is a negative impact of aid on per capita real GDP in the short run.\n",

One possible situation that trade leads to negative aid impact on economic growth is when the economy is facing a higher trade deficit. The Ministry of Finance data from Nepal exhibits that Nepal is having trade deficit in an increasing trend over the past two decades. The combination of policy variables money supply and budget deficit in the model, however, provides the evidence in favour of positive long-run impact of aid on per capita real GDP. On the other hand, all three different combinations of the policy variables in the model suggests that there is significant negative aid effect in the short run.",

There have been countless arguments over the period on whether aid has been utilized effectively for the economic upliftment and growth of the recipient countries [7, 8]. Taking a case of Nepal, we have been analyzed the effectiveness of aid in the economic growth of developing countries. The results show that foreign aid independently is not adequate for economic growth. The higher level of capital formation in-lined with enhanced technology and improved skills on human capital significantly increases the aid effectiveness. Aid effectiveness increases when the macroeconomic indicators show an improvement resulting in an enhanced economic situation. There is a negative impact of aid on per capita real GDP in the short run which is because of ineffective aid monitoring, problems related to aid management and aid conditionalities.",

Current status of trade in the economy is impeding foreign aid to be utilized in the targeted sector. The policy should be reviewed so that the size of ever-increasing trade deficit reduces. Similarly, foreign aid should be monitored strictly in order that its goal is fulfilled. A sudden increase in remittance, resulting in a culture of dependency, also fuels up the trade deficit which directly or indirectly reduces aid effectiveness. However, further investigation should be carried out to draw a conclusion on how remittance affects the effectiveness of foreign aid. Although one of the main objectives of this study was to research on the latest economic activities, it was not possible to cover the recent years because of the lack of data. This restricted the outcome of the paper as we were not able to see the most recent impact of aid on the growth.",
