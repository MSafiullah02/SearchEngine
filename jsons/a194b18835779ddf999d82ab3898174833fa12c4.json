The aviation sector has traditionally been a publicly controlled industry, with a high degree of government intervention, for both strategic and economic reasons. Already in 1919, the Paris Convention stipulated that states have sovereign rights in the airspace above their territory. Consequently, a series of bilateral agreements was established between countries that the airlines wished to fly over. The Chicago Convention (1944) made a distinction between various forms of freedom for using the airspace, ranging from the 1st freedom (the right to fly over the territory of a contracting state without landing) to the 8th freedom (the right to transport passengers and cargo within another state between the airports in that state). The airline sector ultimately became an overregulated -and thus inefficiently operating -industrial sector in the post-war period all.",

Various alliances have also occurred, but less mergers, to strike a balance between scale advantages and national identity/visibility. Among the above recent developments, it should be noted that one of the most striking facts in Europe has been the rapid emergence of LCCs (for example, Ryanair, easy Jet). Despite the relatively low fares, most LCCs manage to be profitable and to conquer a significant part of the (rising) passenger demand. In most cases, they offer elementary services and fly uniform -but often modernaircraft.

In the present paper we will investigate the structure and evolution of the airline network of Lufthansa, both individually and in Network Analysis network analysis, as exemplified for instance by traditional graph theory. Network analysis has become an established tool in, for example, operations research, telecommunication systems analysis and transportation science, while in more recent years it has also become an important analytical tool in industrial organization, sociology, social psychology, and economics and business administration (Barth\u00e9lemy, 2003; Gorman & Kulkarni, 2004; Gorman, 2005; Schintler, Gorman, Reggiani, Patuelli, & Nijkamp, 2005; Schintler, Gorman, Reggiani, Patuelli, Gillespie, et al., 2005; Reggiani & Nijkamp, 2006; Patuelli, 2007) . Air transport is a prominent example of modern network constellations and will be addressed in this paper from a connectivity perspective. Air transport shows indeed clear network features, which impact on the way single airline carriers operate (Button & Stough, 2000) . The abundant scientific literature on airline networks has addressed this topic in terms of theoretical modelling and empirical measurements on different typologies of airline network configurations.",

Without national or political impediments in a free market, these carriers typically organize their network into a hub-and-spoke system, where one or a few central airports called 'hubs' have a high number of links to the other airports called 'spokes'. Passengers travelling from a place of origin to a place of destination have to stop typically in one or a few hubs to change aircraft. Hubs are organised in order to allow flight connectivity by coordinating the scheduled timetable of the arriving and departing flights. Investigating the airline strategy in designing hub connectivity and timetable coordination has been the aim of several empirical network studies. Some examples of theoretical and empirical investigation of hub connectivity can be found in the works of Bootsma (1997) , Dennis (1998) , Rietveld and Brons (2001) , Veldhuis and Kroes (2002), and Burghouwt and de Wit (2003) .

Furthermore, an airline network can be interconnected or interlined to partner's networks within the alliance concerned. This classification is based on geographical, air transport-political and economic characteristics, such as airlines' degree of freedom from the Chicago Convention (see Cento, 2006 ) market liberalization, or costs and traffic demand.

As summarized in Table 10 .3, we coin networks A1 and A2, referring respectively to the flights operated by Lufthansa in Europe and in the whole world, while networks B1 and B2 take into consideration -respectively at a European and at a global level -the flights operated by all the carriers which are members of Star Alliance (to which Lufthansa belongs). The variable under analysis is represented by the number of direct connections of each airport in the summer season of the year 2006, measured on a weekly basis. In all four cases we only consider those airports where Lufthansa operates with its fleet and not by partner's airlines. When we consider A1 and A2 networks, we clearly see that the majority of Lufthansa's flights are operated at a continental level. On the contrary, nearly half of Star Alliance's flights are operated outside Europe.

It should be noted that in our MCA procedure, the entropy indicator needs to be transformed positively because the real values of the entropy function increase when networks are more heterogeneous, that is, less concentrated. The second group of macro-criteria refers to the networks' physical measurement. Here, the diameter needs to be converted in utility, because its value is higher when Here the Regime method and software has been used (Hinloopen & Nijkamp, 1990) . 10 10 networks are less centralized. The third group of macro-criteria is related to connectivity. This property is investigated through the interpolation of the ranked degree distributions, where -in the power function -the highest exponent of 0.99 implies a value of the exponent degree -in the associated power-law distribution -close to 2 (perfect hub-and-spoke). The R2 and the coefficient of the exponential function need to be converted to utility, since both values indicate random and homogeneous patterns. We have carried out five scenarios by considering: (a) all the criteria mentioned above; (b) each macro-criteria separately; (c) concentration and topology criteria together. In each scenario an equal weight, that is, unknown priority, has been given to the single criteria. The results are listed in Table 10 .7. These findings point out that network A1 prevails, however with two exceptions. The former is represented by network A2, which is the top-scorer when we consider the criteria related to the networks' concentration/geography: this finding comes from the higher centralization and concentration degree of network A2, as See Footnote 9. 11 11 10. Connectivity and Competition in Airline Networks demonstrated by the Freeman and Gini indices. The latter exception is represented by network B1, which prevails when we consider the criteria related to the physical measurement of networks.",
