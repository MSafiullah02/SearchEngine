Though chromosome banding techniques based on Giemsa staining revolutionized cytogenetic analysis, they did not become popular because of limited resolution involving only >3 Mb of DNA. Certain chromosomal aberrations such as reciprocal translocations and inversions were not easily recognizable with Giemsa stain. Besides that these techniques are very time consuming, and interpretation of karyotype is very cumbersome and uncertain.",

These techniques have been successfully applied to both animals and plants. RNA probes can be designed for any gene or any sequence within a gene for visualization of mRNA, long noncoding RNA and miRNA in tissues and cells. These probes, often derived from the fragments of DNA that were isolated, purified, and amplified for use in Human Genome Project, consist of about 20 oligonucleotide pairs and cover a space of 40\u201350 bp of target RNA. In 1982, a new method was described to localize DNA sequences hybridized in situ to chromosome. This method utilized a biotin-labeled analogue of thymidine (TTP) which could be incorporated enzymatically into DNA probes by nick translation. The sites of hybridization were detected either cytochemically by using avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, or fluorometrically by using fluorescein-labeled antibodies. Compared to autoradiography this technique decreased the time required for detection, improved resolution, and gave less non-specific background and chemically stable hybridization probes.",

Mukai et al. (1993), using multicolor FISH with total genomic probes and highly repeated sequences, reported simultaneous detection of three genomes of an allohexaploid wheat.

The probes are either labeled indirectly with a hapten or directly through incorporation of a fluorophore. The labeled probe and the target DNA are mixed together after denaturation, which allows annealing of complementary DNA sequences. In case the probe had been labeled indirectly, an extra step of enzymatic or immunological detection system will be required for visualization of the non-fluorescent hapten. Finally the signals are evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 16.3). The enzymatic detection system involves fluorochrome, which emits colored signals at the hybridization site. The immunological detection system is based on binding of antibodies to specific antigens, which is then demonstrated with a colored histochemical reaction visible by light microscope or fluorochromes with ultraviolet light.\n",

            "text": "One of the most important steps in FISH analysis is the choice of probe. A wide range of probes, extending from whole genomes to small cloned probes (1\u201310 kb), can be used. There are basically three types of probes, each with a different range of applications, whole chromosome painting probes, repetitive sequence probes, and locus specific probes, which are briefly described below.Chromosome painting refers to the hybridization of fluorescently labeled chromosome-specific composite probe pools to cytological preparations. This enables visualization of individual chromosomes in metaphase or interphase cells and the identification of chromosomal aberrations. The whole chromosome painting probes are complex DNA probes derived from a single type of chromosome that has been PCR amplified and labeled to generate a \u201cpaint\u201d which homogeneously highlights the entire chromosome. With this probe, the cytologically visible structural and numerical chromosome rearrangement in metaphase becomes obvious. The chromosomal paint is, however, not helpful in the analysis of interphase cells. Whole chromosome painting is now available for every human chromosome, allowing the simultaneous painting of the entire genetic complement in 24 colors. This has led to the development of two independent FISH techniques \u2013 multicolor FISH (M-FISH) and spectral karyotyping (SKY) \u2013 which have important diagnostic and research application values.Repetitive sequence probes hybridize to specific chromosomal regions or structures that contain short sequences, which are present in many thousands of copies. For example, pan-telomeric probes target the tandemly repeated (TTAGGG) sequences present in all human chromosomes ends. Centromeric probes target the \u03b1- and \u03b2-satellite sequences, flanking the centromeres of human chromosomes. Satellite DNA probes hybridize to multiple copies of the repeat sequences present at the centromeres, resulting in two very bright fluorescent signals in both metaphase and interphase diploid cells. These centromere-specific probes are useful in detection of monosomy, trisomy, and other aneuploidies in leukemias and solid tumors (Fig. 16.4).\nLocus-specific probes are usually genomic clones, which vary in size depending on the nature of the cloning vector from plasmids (which can carry 1\u201310 kb) to the larger PAC (P1 bacteriophage-derived artificial chromosome, which can carry 100\u2013300 kb), YAC (yeast artificial chromosome which can carry 150\u2013350 kb), and RAC vectors (which can carry 80 kb to 1 Mb). These probes are particularly useful for detection of translocations, inversions, and deletions in both metaphase and interphase.\n",

These haptens can be incorporated as labeled nucleotides by tagging technique of nick translation, random primer labeling, or PCR according to the routine procedures. Detection of hybridized digoxigenin probes is mediated by anti-digoxigenin antibodies conjugated to enzyme or fluorochrome.

IN CGH, the genomic DNA from the specimen and the control DNA extracted from an individual with a normal karyotype (46,XX or 46,XY) are differentially labeled with green and red fluorochromes, respectively, mixed in equal amounts and co-hybridized to reference human metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 16.10). The relative difference in DNA content between the normal and specimen DNA is represented by a difference in the green/red fluorescence ratios. For example, if the chromosomal material is present in identical copy numbers in both the reference and the specimen genome, the observed fluorescence is a blend of an equal contribution of red and green fluorescence. If chromosomes are lost or chromosomal subregions are deleted in the specimen genome, the resulting color is shifted to red. A gain in the certain chromosome in the specimen, such as amplification of oncogenes, is reflected by a more intense green staining of the respective chromosome in the reference metaphase preparation. The ratios of the test to reference fluorescence along the chromosomes are quantified using digital image analysis.\n",

Targeting nuclear RNA and the corresponding genes within cells or within a single cell or from a single allele can provide important information about gene expression, processing, and transport of transcripts in normal and mutant cells. The use of RNA FISH for studying the intracellular localization of RNA has increased over understanding of in situ physical characteristics of DNA transcription and transport of RNA transcripts. Similarly FISH can be used to examine many interesting biological questions about nuclear organization. Three-dimensional nuclear DNA FISH can provide high-resolution information about sub-chromosomal domains, gene position, and the relationship of genes and their transcripts in different cells and during different stages of the cell cycle. Accurate analysis of three-dimensional FISH is highly dependent on excellent quality confocal microscopy and image analysis procedures.",

CGH is performed in normal chromosome metaphase spreads, which is a distinct advantage for studying tumor samples. The resolution of identifying chromosomal gains and losses on metaphase chromosomes is several Mbs. However, this technique has been modified to increase the resolution to several Kbs by the technique of matrix or array CGH, in which the targets are cloned DNA fragments immobilized on the glass surface. This allows detection of low copy number gains and losses and may be used diagnostically to identify microdeletions or amplifications affecting only one or two genes.",
