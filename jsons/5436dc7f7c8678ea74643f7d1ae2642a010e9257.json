The infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus .",

The entire healthcare organization will eventually need to adjust to blockchain technology applications to support and fight COVID-19 outbreaks. In a globalized world in which we live, entities such as the World Health Organization have put in place the World Health Organization to ensure cooperation between different governments on issues related to global health. In the face of epidemics such as the one we are witnessing at the moment, these organizations need to obtain correct and accurate information to judge the best course of action: as we have observed over the past three months, quickly, reliable scientific data, sharing and reporting of this data, is the key to understanding, thus reducing global outbreaks.

By nature, we refer to the blockchain as a \"decentralization\" technique, which means that data is not stored in a single server but is shared among many participants, stores, and websites. As a result, health documents added to the blockchain can be accessed by all interested parties (who have the required permissions) in a transparent and reliable environment. This new technology has been proposed to disable a wide range of data-driven areas, including the health field.",

For example, by giving each patient a unique identifier and the creation of an intelligent contract between patients and professionals that ensures that the joint data is reliable and accurate and thus will increase efficiency, with a faster diagnosis.

Most importantly, cooperation between health workers around the world could also be enhanced. Accessing a patient's record can be a time consuming exercise and may delay patient care. It may also lead to poor management of these records and, in the worst case scenario, misdiagnosis. Digitizing records with a blockchain can reduce these shortcomings by creating a network where reliable information is immediately available. This paper proposes a COVID-19 Blockchain platform as a new approach could be applied to fight the COVID-19 diseases outbreaks by automatically detecting unknown infected cases as well as predicting and estimating the contagion risk of COVID-19 epidemic in the real-time for communities. Peer-to-peer blockchain, time stamping, and decentralized storage features can support and strengthen the proposed system with important features in case of infection detection, contagion risk prediction and estimation of COVID-19 virus in real societies. The proposed platform can be designed based on four subsystems, infection verification subsystem, a Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile application, and a Mass-Surveillance system.

Regular expression (far away specifying programming languages as we know about the common utilization of Regular Expression) is an interesting technique to represent data (or object) patterns and its derived follower instances. The main advantage of using regular expression for representing data patterns is the wide range of instancederivation possibilities, you can create one regular expression pattern and derive so many follower instances to this pattern, and it is a very good motivation to Specify COVID-19 Cases using Regular Expression Patterns.",

For example, if a person who has the infection instance \" has been accepted by the corresponding Automaton model, this mean that this person has high probability of contagion Additional benefits of using this technique for verifying COVID-19 contagion are that the infection patterns codes can be used to digitally store and track the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the blockchain as a new added block. On the other hand, the infection instances codes will be used in P2P communications between all citizens using the P2P-mobile application. The infection instances will be also used in estimating the contagion risk and infection probability between citizens. In the coming two sections, we will explain in more details how blockchain can be used as P2P repository and tracker for confirmed COVID-19 cases (section 3.2) , and how the P2P mobile Application can be used for detecting the unknown infected cases by automatically sending SMS notifications between persons and the relevant authorities. In addition, the P2P Mobile App will be used for estimating contagion risk from infected persons and infected places to help people to take their precautions (section 3.3). ",

The new stored infection patterns and the corresponding infection instances represent a new added block to blockchain at a specific time. Moreover the P2P design of blockchain can enable to automatically detect the unknown infected cases; this can be achieved by a hidden interaction that occurs between blockchain and the P2P mobile application once a new block is added to blockchain. With the proposed system in this study, we propose an update to the block design as well as specifying a new method by which a new block is added to the blockchain. The classical and known design of blockchain which was used since the advent of digital currencies [15] is not effective manner with the proposed system's functionality. This is due to the difference in stored data types and the mining way by which the new block is validated and added to the blockchain. Hence, the two important questions are: what is the new update in the block design? And how a new block is added to the blockchain?",

So every time a new infection code is tried, the block gets a new hash code. The Miners repeat this process by trying new infection codes many times until they randomly obtain the infection code that meets the target block hash code BHC. The new block is created when the valid BHC is obtained by the fastest miner. For example, if we have seven infection patterns registered in the blockchain as confirmed-COVID-19 cases, and the system detected corresponding 1000 infected instances (i.e.1000 persons who are probable infected cases) as well as the blockchain operator staff consist of four miners. So, each miner will try to obtain the valid hash code of the new block by doing repeated tries of the infection codes until the valid one that meets the target block hash code BHC is obtained. Figure 6 explains how blockchain is constructed as sequence of new blocks according to the proposed design. Step 4: when a specific miner succeeded to find the valid hash code of the block first, he then broadcasts this block and its hash code (BHC value) to the remaining miners in the for verifying its validity.",

The P2P-Mobile Application will provide the citizens with two important services: 1) Infection Verification Service. By this mobile service, users are able to receive SMS messages from the blockchain once a novel confirmed COVID-19 case is registered in a specific block in blockchain. The SMS message contain an infection code which represent a probable contagion from the registered confirmed COVID-19 case to the user who received an infection code in his inbox .For example, suppose a confirmed COVID-19 case has been registered in the blockchain with the infection pattern, P/B-0(1+0) * 101 , so , the following set of infection codes , { P/B 011101, P/B 000101, P/B 01011101, P/B 0000101, P/B 0101010101,------} are altogether valid infection codes which generated from the pattern , 0(1+0) * 101. Hence, these infection codes (i.e. infection instances) represent all probable infected persons and places which have been contacted with the identified confirmed COVID-19 case. The infection code in the form P******** represents probable infected person, while the infection code in the form B******** represents probable infected places. So, when a specific person receive an infection code from the blockchain, he can use his mobile-P2P mobile application to verify the validity of his infection code as well as know all details of infection information such as, contagion source (i.e. infection pattern), contagion situation, contagion location, contagion time, etc. Each user can verifies his infection code by establishing a connection between his P2P-mobile application and the infection verifier subsystem. The user can login to the system and enter his received infection code, and then the infection verifier subsystem calls the appropriate Finite Automaton machine for verifying the entered code.If the infection code is accepted by the Finite Automaton Machine, this mean that the person who hold this code is counted as a probable infected person , after that, the system send him all details of this infection case.Figure 9explains how a user can use the infection verification service through his P2P-mobile application to verify his infection code and be acknowledged with all detailed information about his infection.",

This goal can be achieved by a hidden communication established between blockchain platform and the P2P-Mobile applications. when a new confirmed COVID-19 case is registered as a new infection patterns and all the corresponding infection instances are detected by the Mass-Surveillance System , the blockchain platform sends streams of infection codes (in the form SMS messages) to all detected persons (i.e. infected instances) by Mass-Surveillance System. Using P2P-Mobile Application, each person can receive many infection codes in his inbox from the blockchain. The more confirmed-COVID-19 cases you have contacted with, the more infection codes you receive For example, if you received 10-infection codes in your inbox, this mean that you are probably infected from 10-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Using this feature of P2P-Mobile Application, the infection probability of each user can be estimated using Binomial Distribution Function as formulated in equation 3.
