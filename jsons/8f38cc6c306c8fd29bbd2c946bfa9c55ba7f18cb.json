Since 20 th February two large clusters of outbreaks have spread first in the Northern Italy, later all over the country.The virus is spreading very quickly and efficiently and to date numbers about outbreak are very worrying with dramatically increasing within a few weeks: 86,498 total cases (F=42,8%; M=57,2%), 66,414 positive people, 9,134 fatalities and 10,950 recoveries. To date, the number of total cases from Italy's outbreak exceeds those in China (data are updated to 27 th March). Median age of positive cases is 62 years old; median age of fatalities is 80,5 years old; median age of healthcare professionals (HPs) positive cases is 49 years old. Lethality is controversial, probably overestimate due to the fact that there is high number of positive undiagnosed cases. Among the dead there are also very young: 18 between 30 and 39 years old (0,2% of the total), 72 between 40 and 49 years old (0,9% of the total). Most of the dead ranging from 80 to 89 years old, 3,010 (39,7% of the total). Almost all of them with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, lung disease, psychiatric conditions, cancer, diabetes and obesity.

Our HPs are facing COVID-19 pulling 12-hour shifts in critical situations with minimal to non-existent personal protective equipments (PPE). It is utter nonsense not to protect adequately the HPs, for their safety firstly and secondly because this can increase the outbreak. Indeed, lacking PPE led both many HPs to become COVID-19 positive (7,145), and to the death of several doctors (51; about 9% of the total cases; all data are updated to 27 th March).[6] Since March 11 th Italy's government has gradually implemented increasingly restrictive measures, now very severe, extraordinary and profound. De facto almost all of Italy is in lockdown: closure of schools, university, and many business such as theaters, cinemas, pubs, and so on, blanket public transportation restrictions, quarantine zone in all country, sporting events, all religious ceremonies (also funerals and weddings) are suspended. Public parks have even been closed. There are few exceptions such as post offices, pharmacies, and markets/malls that can remain open also during weekend. However, we are a democracy, and Italian Constitution guarantees the freedom of people, so it is very difficult for the Italian government to take stricter measures. On March 26 th , the governor of the Lombardy Region, the region most affected by the virus and which sees the number of positive cases increasing, said: \"I am worried, I do not know if we missed something\". Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister has recently announced that lockdown will continues until April 13 th .",
