Of these, Causeway Bay has special significance as the origin and site of Hong Kong\u2019s two most famous annual political rituals (4 June and 1 July.) Within this area there are several streets and locations that are typically usurped from their normal entertainment or shopping functions to become sites of political and social justice claims. This includes East Point Road, Patterson Street Pedestrian area, Times Square, and Victoria Park.",

And, though only briefly discussed in this chapter, the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention center (the Center) in Wan Chai and Golden Bauhinia Square (the Square) attached to it on Victoria Harbor have special political significance (Clarke 2007) as well as serves as sites of protest as they are seen by some subalterns emblematic of the Hong Kong SAR (HKSAR) instead of Hong Kong. The Center is where the ceremonies for Hong Kong\u2019s return to China were held in 1997 and its chief executives are sworn in to office by China. The Square is also the location of the SAR formal flag rising and SAR Day celebrations on the first of each July. China\u2019s national holidays are also celebrated at the Square with flag raising ceremonies. A variety of large government forums related to Hong Kong\u2019s relationship to the mainland are also hosted at the Center by senior Chinese government officials and senior leaders. In 2012 it was the location of days-long major protests over the installation of the new chief executive by China\u2019s President Hu Jintao. As an iconic resource of the local and national hegemons, this space during the special days and events becomes \u201cactivated\u201d in the political rhetoric of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d and has an increased subaltern interest as a counter-hegemonic site of visual contention and disruption. Situated at a short distance from the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) barracks and the new central government offices in admiralty, the area will probably increase in importance as a protest site in the future given the growing contestations between Hongkongers and their local and central governments.",

In 2010, for instance, a pre-June 4th rally in the Times Square piazza featured a large replica of the Goddess of Democracy that was subsequently confiscated by the Hong Kong police; reportedly over to \u201csafety\u201d concerns raised by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department2. Activists arrested in the incident were prosecuted and found guilty under a Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance because they did not have a license to display the statue; this was the first time ever that the Ordinance had been used to squelch political speech.

Mixed with these demands is a cornucopia of local political and social justice issues. One party offers T-shirts depicting the chief executive elect as a sly wolf; others have a huge proletarian worker crushing Hong Kong\u2019s tycoons and colluding government officials for bleeding the residents dry; the Tiananmen Mothers and the \u2018Tank man of Tiananmen\u2019 are other iconic visuals on display.",

It serves both as a destination and origin for protest activities and tends to be one of the venues used more often by the so called \u201cpatriotic forces\u201d in Hong Kong. On 1 July, for example, Southorn has at various times hosted \u201cpatriotic\u201d carnivals, demonstrations, and rallies as an alternative event to the much larger and diverse 1 July \u201cdemocracy march\u201d from Victoria Park. These events, in contrast to those taking place in Victoria Park, celebrate the return of Hong Kong and the Chinese national flag is often seen. Festivities also tend to resemble mainland celebrations in that traditional Chinese cultural and ethnic themes denoting unity and harmony are emphasized. These events are also patronized by Chinese and SAR Government officials and institutions such as the PLA ceremonial and performance troops. Examples of dominant forces\u2019 other uses of the Southorn Playground include hosting election campaign rallies for the chief executive (Chan 2007a, b) and publicizing government initiatives with variety shows such as \u201cCulture in Motion: A Celebration of Racial Harmony\u201d (HKSAR Government 2007).",

The action not only placed an anti-capitalist virus in the very midst of Hong Kong, Chinese, and international corporate chieftains and tycoons, but also quite literally inserted itself in the bowels of the HSBC complex itself which encompasses large public open space. Located adjacent to Statute Square, the public area under HSBC had typically been used for various corporate and social events and activities. On Sundays, it is one of the many destinations in Central (and elsewhere in Hong Kong) where tens-of-thousands of foreign domestic workers congregate on their day off. Numerous banners and placards were set-up on the periphery of the settlement and on street railings facing a major thoroughfare next to the bank. All of which were easily visible to pedestrians, and trams and vehicular traffic. The demonstrators\u2019 \u201coccupation city\u201d consisted of bookshelves, couches, desks, sleeping bags, tents, and even a small kitchen. According to press accounts, about 50 protesters lived in the camp at the peak of the movement. Following the trend of other major cities evicting \u201coccupy\u201d settlements from public urban spaces, HSBC took legal action in June 2012 to begin the removal of the camp, claiming that it needed the public area for fund raising and other events, and that the occupation had been a nuisance to its customers and had forced the bank to incur security expenses because of the protesters; they also accused the movement of attempting to monopolize the public space (Cheung 2012).
