            "text": "Globally, there has been a broad call to reduce \"elective\" neurosurgical operations with the aim to minimize potential exposure of fragile neurosurgical patients with diseases other than COVID-19. Consequently, neurosurgeons are expected to devise alternative plans of how and when to treat non-emergent neurosurgical patients. Nonetheless, apart from clear-cut emergent cases, the timing of neurosurgery may be crucial, even in some elective procedures, such as intracranial tumors or cervical myelopathy. These situations often In fact, although some surgeries could be delayed for a significant period of time, others need to be scheduled more promptly, despite the pandemic, because of the risk of illness progression by delay (i.e., malignant brain tumors and vascular disease). With this in view, it must be understood that the choice to postpone an operation must be made with consideration of medical and logistical factors, as no one can anticipate the influence of COVID-19 in the near or more distant future, and individual cases might be deemed emergencies that cannot be safely delayed.

The neurosurgical scientific community, especially led by the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies, has promptly reacted by producing a growing number of documents that could serve as guidance for neurosurgeons all over the world. Nevertheless, the drafting of recommendations and guidelines for the best neurosurgical practices in the COVID-19 era is still on-going. We strongly believe that, during these difficult times, a daily referral to the Neurosurgical Societies' webpages will represent a key tool to spread information, suggestions, considerations and models to optimize care of neurosurgical patients all over the world, as well as to maintain high standards of surgical education, thus guiding the neurosurgical community through the COVID-19 crisis.

At this point, only published literature, reports, and suggestions could truly represent guidance for the worldwide neurosurgical community facing such a complex decision-making process. Burke, et al performed a literature review and consulted Chinese neurosurgeons who provided first-hand knowledge of how neurosurgical cases were scheduled during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. They included those recommendations as discussion points in the Evidence Review Panel (ERP). They tried to schedule neurosurgical cases according to the level of viral disease in the community, staffing shortage, and related recommendations for emergent, urgent and elective procedures. They then proposed a checklist for neurosurgical cases according to the level of urgency, availability of operating rooms and postoperative beds. The decision is made through a peer review process for patient selection 7 .This paper is an important systematic attempt to address the problems of neurosurgical practice in the COVID-19 era. There are, however, no worldwide guidelines applicable to different settings varying for virus surge and its related evolving and unpredictable situations, local hospital and health organizations, and availability of operating rooms, ICU beds and staffing.General recommendations have been suggested by the American College ofSurgeons: \"Each hospital, health system, and surgeon should thoughtfully review all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize, postpone, or cancel electively scheduled operations, endoscopies, or other invasive procedures until we have passed the predicted inflection point in the exposure graph and can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.\" (https://www.facs.org/covid-19/clinical-guidance/elective-surgery).These recommendations were adopted in the EANS website proposals: ://cdn.ymaws.com/www.eans.org/resource/resmgr/documents/corona/eans advice2020 corona.pdf). This scale is similar to the tiering of elective scheduling proposed byBurke, et al,7 but has the advantage of listing examples of neurosurgical diseases and related actions.",

This virtual platform could be used by smartphones or webcam-enabled computers and allows physicians to effectively screen patients with early signs of COVID-19 before reaching the hospital.Another topic of interest is the maintenance of essential standard medical and surgical education among students and residents during epidemic conditions. In Italy, as neurosurgical daily activities were drastically reduced and limited only to procedures which could not be deferred, some senior faculty became engaged in emergency management, reducing their neurosurgical availability and teaching time. It is evident that this unprecedented crisis has an impact on resident and medical students training, considering that it is very difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic. For teaching purposes, webinars, seminars, or other presentations should take place on the Internet, allowing participants in different locations to see and hear the presenter, ask questions, and occasionally respond to polls.
