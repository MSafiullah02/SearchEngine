            "text": "Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the leading cause for commencing invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The common causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure include pneumonia, lung edema and atelectasis1. The pathophysiology of hypoxemia in these conditions is related to the loss of alveolar space due to consolidation and alveolar derecruitment. Nevertheless, the affected lungs might not be fully aerated after the patients survive the acute critical illness. A certain extent of alveolar space loss may remain, even after patients have recovered to the status of readiness to extubate. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is a measure of lung function that can be used to quantify the extent of loss of alveolar space. Reduced FRC before extubation may have negative impact on subsequent weaning outcome2. However, whether FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure has not been evaluated.",

Previous studies suggested that FRC was a good indicator of aeration and recruitment of lung tissue4,5. The normal FRC in healthy individuals is approximate 30\u201335 mL/Kg per predicted body weight in the sitting position6\u20138. Traditionally, FRC can be measured by means of gas dilution, nitrogen washout, body plethysmography or computed tomography2,3,9. These measurement techniques require standardized pulmonary function equipment, which is difficult to use in ventilated patients in the ICU. However, new techniques are now available to measure FRC in ventilated patients without interrupting mechanical ventilation10,11. Based on a nitrogen multiple breath washout technique, a reliable FRC measuring method has been integrated into ventilators and can be easily used in the ICU10.",

The risk of extubation failure after passing an SBT is estimated to be 10\u201320%14, and reintubation is associated with poor outcome15,16. Clinical practice guidelines recommend extubating patients at high risk for extubation failure to preventative NIV17. The traditional risk factors for extubation failure include old age, coexisting COPD or congestive heart failure, and hypercapnia during the SBT17.

The results suggested that FRC had similar discrimination capacity with RSBI in our study population. RSBI is a widely used predictor for extubation outcomes and is designed to evaluate a patient\u2019s tolerance to spontaneous breathing18,19. A high RSBI score indicates a rapid shallow breathing pattern, which is an early sign of decompensation. In contrast, the measure of FRC is used to assess the change of lung volume in a disease status2. FRC usually decreases in diseases leading hypoxemic respiratory failure and increases in obstructive airway diseases. In our study, we tested the association between FRC and extubation outcomes in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure were excluded because their change in FRC may be pathophysiologically different from that in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Our findings suggested that reduced FRC was a risk factor for extubation failure. In the ICUs where bedside measurement of FRC is available, clinicians could consider using this modality to identify patients with increased risk for extubation failure, especially for patients with diseases that loss of lung volume is a key feature. However, this observational study did not test whether FRC can be used to guide the decision of extubation.",

We think this is a practical approach to assess the change in FRC at the bedside, especially when reference values of FRC are not available. The range of FRC in a healthy individual measured in a sitting or standing position is around 30\u201335 mL/kg6,7. The FRC in our study (median, 25 mL/Kg, IQR, 20\u201332 mL/Kg) was below the normal reference values. The reduction of FRC observed in this study may be attributable to disease- and measurement-related factors. Diseases causing hypoxemic respiratory failure could result in a certain extent of loss of alveolar volume. Although the patients had been recovering from hypoxemic respiratory failure when the FRC was measured, the disease-related alveolar space loss may not be totally restored. The measured values of FRC are also affected by the settings of measurement. Previous studies have shown that FRC varies largely with sex, body height, age, posture, intubation, PEEP levels8,20,21. The European Respiratory Society provides an estimate of the FRC in healthy sitting individuals according to sex, height, and age21. In addition, FRC may decrease by 25% in healthy subjects in the supine position compared with the sitting position8. Intubated patients without pulmonary diseases could have 30\u201340% decreased FRC compared with predicted values20. The effect is probably related to a cranial shift of the diaphragm and loss of muscle tension among intubated patients.",

Similar findings have been observed in previous studies22,23. These findings support the idea that patients with reduced FRC before extubation have worse gas exchange and alveolar ventilation. To diminish the detrimental effects of FRC reduction, several modalities may be applied to reduce the risk of extubation failure. NIV provides inspiratory pressure support and PEEP, which may prevent further decruitment of injured lungs after extubation24. Prophylactic NIV support after extubation could be a reasonable intervention for this group of patients. High flow oxygen therapy is another feasible intervention after extubation because it can provide a low level of PEEP25.",

According to the study enrollment procedures, the patients with simple weaning were less likely enrolled in this study because the narrow time window between starting SBT and extubation. The data support this speculation are that the patients included in the current study had average two sessions of SBTs before the planned extubation. The outcome event rate may influence the distribution of FRC of the study cohort because higher extubation failure rates usually suggest poor respiratory reserve or lower FRC.
