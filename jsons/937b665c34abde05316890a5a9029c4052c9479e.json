Many organisms are known to utilize ribosomal frameshifting to express a minority of genes. However, finding ribosomal frameshift sites by a computational method is difficult because frameshift signals are diverse and dependent on the organisms and environments. There are few computer programs available for public use to identify frameshift sites from genomic sequences. We have developed a web-based application program called FSFinder2 for predicting frameshift sites of general type. We tested FSFinder2 on the Escherichia coli K12 genome to detect potential -1 frameshifting genes. From the genome sequence, we identified 18,401 frameshift sites following the X XXY YYZ motif. 11,530 frameshift sites out of the 18,401 sites include secondary structures. Comparison with the GenBank annotation produced 11 potential frameshift sites, including 3 known frameshift sites.

This alternative translational event is called 'recoding'. Recoding events include frameshifting, read-through and bypassing [1] [2] [3] . In frameshifting, ribosomes shift reading frame by one or more nucleotides at a specific mRNA signal between overlapping genes [4] . Frameshifts are classified into different types depending on the number of nucleotides shifted and the shifting direction. The most common type is a -1 frameshift, in which the ribosome slips a single nucleotide in the upstream direction. -1 frameshifting requires a frameshift cassette that consists of a slippery site, a stimulatory RNA structure and a spacer. +1 frameshifts are much less common than -1 frameshifts, but have been observed in diverse organisms [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 283, "end": 286, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 287, "end": 290, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 890, "end": 893, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "No program exists to predict general types of frameshift.

The rest four genes, mhpD-mhpF, fliM-fliN, atoS-atoC and yijC-yijD, have no downstream secondary structures and have a lower probability of frameshifting than the other 7 genes. There exist previous works similar to our approach. Hammell et al. [7] studied -1 ribosomal frameshift signals in the large databases. Using their well-established model, they found that -1 frameshifts occur with frequencies from two-to six-fold greater than random. They considered the nucleotides of a frameshift site, spacer, and pseudoknot. However, they focused on the -1 frameshifts only. Bekaert et al. [6] performed a computational method similar to Hammell's approach. From their model, they designed a model for -1 eukaryotic frameshifting. But these two programs are not available for public use. The FreqAnalysis [9] is an application program available for public use. FreqAnalysis was implemented in the Java language and can find putative translational frameshift from probabilistic calculation. In fact, Shah et al. [9] found putative frameshift sites from the Sacharomyces cerevisiae ORFs. But FreqAnalysis does not consider the X XXY YYZ frameshift motif. Thus it is hard to compare the results of FreqAnalysis with ours directly. Fig. 7 shows the result of the FSFinder2.

The i21_1 gene located in 0 frame and the yi22_1 gene located in -1 frame are partially overlapped.
