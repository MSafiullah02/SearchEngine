This letter aims at offering an alternative viewpoint on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV2 neuroinvasion. As elegantly reported by the Authors, direct neuroinvasion via hematogenous spread or migration through the olfactory tract are possible infection routes to the Central Nervous System (CNS). However, the virus could also gain access to the CNS from the periphery and, notably, the brainstem invasion via the vagal afferents from the lung and upper airways has been postulated in COVID-19 patients [2] .",
