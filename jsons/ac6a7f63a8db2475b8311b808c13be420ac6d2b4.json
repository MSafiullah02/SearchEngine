While there have been no terrorist \"spectaculars\" or dramatic news reports in recent years, this does not mean that the CBRN threat has diminished. In 2003 a project called National NBC Protection was started in order to guarantee efficient coordination of all partners involved in CBRN prevention and incident management at all levels with the aim of improving the NBC protection in Switzerland in the long term. The availability of outstanding expertise in terms of NBC protection therefore remains as important as ever for the Swiss population.",

However, terrorism, violent extremism and the proliferation of WMD as well as transport accidents and technical incidents involving hazardous materials evoked \"new\" CBRN-threats. Especially the sarin attack in Tokyo (1995), the US Anthrax attacks (2001) and the SARS epidemic (2002/2003) have provoked serious debates about the risks of potential CBRN incidents and their respective management in Switzerland. Consequently the security policy of Switzerland with respect to potential CBRN risks has profoundly changed and called for the availability of consistent professional competence in order to serve an all-inclusive civil-based and military-supported CBRN-protection to the Swiss population. To cope with this new situation it was necessary to reassess all organisations and structures involved in today's CBRN defence.",

The Federal Council agreed, and asked the Federal Commission for NBC Protection (ComNBC) and the Director of the Federal Office for Civil Protection (FOCP) to carry out a project on \"National NBC Protection\". The aim of this project was to identify what action was needed, and to propose recommendations on how processes and organisations could be optimised. When examining the \"current status\", the project team identified several weak points that could seriously hamper the effective management of major incidents. These include a lack of coordination between federal and cantonal levels, the involvement of myriad agencies and individuals, noticeable overlapping, and the lack of a uniform approach to operational planning at the cantonal level. The project has therefore put forward 16 measures (Table 3. in prevention of CBRN incidents, optimised availability of resources, review of res-federal command structures, National coordination of strategic and operational tasks ponsibilities at the federal and cantonal level, and standardisation of operation doctrines, training courses and material components [4, 5] .",

The NBC Competence Centre in Spiez is mobilised in the event of a major NBC incident which exceeds the capabilities of the on-site civilian operational forces. Thanks to its wide range of resources and services, the NBC Competence Centre can be rapidly deployed in order to provide both civilian and military organisations with subsidiary back-up. If a nuclear or radiological incident occurs, the Radioactivity Monitoring Team of the Swiss Armed Forces (MORA), NBC Competence Centre personnel, and all available NBC Defence militia personnel are called on to offer their specialist expertise in this field. The DDPS Deployment Team (EEVBS) and the SPIEZ LABORATORY will both be deployed during a chemical incident.
