A concept is an association between attributes (terms or topics) that is coherently verified in a subset of objects (documents). Concept analysis has been largely pursued to explore taxonomic relationships within a corpus, addressing the typical limitations that peer unsupervised approaches face in high-dimensional and sparse spaces [19] . Formal concept analysis (FCA) aims at finding, in Boolean data spaces, concepts as subsets of topics that co-occur in a subset of documents. FCA is the paradigmatic approach to concept analysis [11] . Despite its well-recognized relevance to derive ontologies for content categorization, FCA is hampered by major drawbacks. First, it imposes the selection of binarization thresholds to decide whether a topic is represented in a given document, making it vulnerable to subjective choices and to the item-boundaries problem [13] . As a result, FCA is unable to retain concepts sensitive to the varying predominance of topics in a given document, neglecting the rich nature of vector space models. Also, by focusing on dense regions, FCA neglects potentially relevant concepts, such as where specific topics have a preserved order of importance in a subset of documents [24] .",

The use of biclustering for concept analysis is here termed coherent concept analysis (in contrast with formal concept analysis) since concepts are associations that satisfy specific homogeneity criteria of interest, therefore going beyond the strict Boolean formal view. Coherent concepts are sensitive to the predominance of each topic in a given document. In spite of its potentialities, existing research on biclustering text collections pursue specific forms of homogeneity [2, 5] , not offering a discussion on how different homogeneity and quality criteria affect concept analysis. In addition, existing research leaves aside current breakthroughs in the biclustering domain [12, 16] .

            "text": "FCA in Digital Collections. FCA has been largely applied in Boolean space models given either by terms or (previously extracted) topics. In [4] , a method is proposed, guided by both internal clustering quality metrics (Davies-Bouldin Index [7] , Dunn Index [9] , Silhouette coefficient [31] and The Calinski-Harabasz Index [21] ) and external metrics (Reliability, Sensitivity and F-measure [1] ). The experimental analysis used a collection of 2200 manually labeled tweets from 61 entities. The binary attributes are given by terms, named entities, references and URLs. A concept lattice is inferred using the Next Neighbours [3] algorithm. Each formal concept is here seen as a topic. Still, a large number of non-relevant topics is generated. The authors thus propose the Stability metric [22] to extract the most promising formal concepts, concluding that, if considering the external evaluation, FCA show a more homogeneous performance than the LDA and Hierarchic Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), with better overall results. Ignatov in [19] and Poelmans et al. in [28] present a survey on different contributions for FCA regarding several applications. Myat and Hla [25] developed a method for web document organization based on FCA. Cimiano et al. [6] presented an approach for the automatic extraction of concept hierarchies from text data. The authors modeled the context of a certain term as a vector representing syntactic dependencies that are automatically acquired from the text corpus with a linguistic parser, producing with the FCA a lattice of partial order that constitutes the concept hierarchy.",

Hundreds of biclustering algorithms were proposed in the last decade, as shown by recent surveys [10, 26] . In recent years, a clearer understanding of the synergies between biclustering and pattern mining paved the rise for a new class of algorithms, referred to as pattern-based biclustering algorithms [13] . Pattern-based biclustering algorithms are inherently prepared to efficiently find exhaustive solutions of biclusters and offer the unprecedented possibility to affect their structure, coherency and quality [12, 14] . This behavior explains why this class of biclustering algorithms are receiving an increasing attention in recent years [13, 18] . BicPAMS [14] consistently combines such state-of-the-art contributions on pattern-based biclustering.",

Dhillon [8] proposed the use of coclustering (a restrictive variant of the biclustering task that imposes a checkboard structure of biclusters [24] ) to explore text collections. Coclustering was applied to vector space models with entries given by w ij \u00d7 log( n nj ), where n is the number of documents and n j the number of statements containing term t j in document d i . The author was able to identify subsets of words and documents with strong correlation along the Cranfield (1400 aeronautical documents), Medline (1033 medical documents) and Cisi (1460 information retrieval documents) collections. Despite its relevance, coclustering requires all elements to belong to a concept (exhaustive condition) and to a single concept only (exclusive condition), largely limiting the inherent flexibility of the biclustering task.",

From the obtained feature matrix, topics were extracted using LSA, LDA and HDP methods. Figure 3 shows for LDA and LSA how the quality of the approaches vary with the number of topics (HDP is nonparametric). The coherence score establishes the quality of the obtained topics by computing the probability of pairs of words in a given topic appearing together on the documents associated with a given topic. In accordance, LDA was selected. A document is then seen as a vector of probabilistic values that corresponds to the likelihood (predominance) of a given topic appear in the document. Formal Concept Analysis. Figure 4 applies FCA [11] to the preprocessed dataset -a vector space model with 35000 documents and 120 topics -under a variable binarization threshold \u03b8. \u03b8 parameterization is a highly sensible choice as evidenced by its impact on the number of formal concepts (from 230 k concepts when \u03b8 = 0.05 to 48 k when \u03b8 = 0.1 and 122 when \u03b8 = 0.5), average number of topics per concept, and the stability criterion [30] . Elements in the vector space model close to \u03b8 are excluded from the concepts. By seeing topics as Bernoulli variables in a Boolean data space, binomial tail statistics [17] reveal that only a small fraction of the returned concepts are statistically significant. [14] is applied as it combines stateof-the-art principles on pattern-based biclustering. BicPAMS is below used with default parameters: varying coherence strength (\u03b4 =\u0100/|L| where |L| \u2208 {2, 3, 4, 5}), decreasing support until 100 dissimilar biclusters are found, up to 30% noisy elements, 0.05 significance level, and constant and order-preserving coherence assumptions. Two search iterations were considered by masking the biclusters discovered after the first iteration to ensure a more comprehensive exploration of the data space and a focus on less-trivial concepts. Topic-based frequency distributions were approximated, and the statistical tests proposed in [17] applied to compute the statistical significance of each concept. Table 1 synthesizes the results produced by BicPAMS [14] on the preprocessed dataset. BicPAMS is able to efficiently find homogeneous, dissimilar and statistically significant concepts (subsets of topics with coherent predominance on a subset of documents). Illustrating, a total of 327 statistically significant concepts (p-value < 1) with constant coherence (|L| = 3) and an average of 112 supporting documents were found. These initial results show the impact of placing coherence assumptions and coherence strength criteria on concept analysis. Table 2 provides the details of four constant biclusters (their respective pattern, topics, coherence strength and statistical significance) using BicPAMS. Each bicluster shows a unique pattern of topic predominance. Figure 5 visually depicts these concepts using line charts and heatmaps. Each line in the chart (and row in the heatmap) represents a document and the values (colors) show the representivity of its topics. These results motivate the relevance of finding constant concepts to group topics in accordance with their representivity in a document, a possibility neglected by FCA.",

            "text": "This work proposes comprehensive principles on how to apply biclustering for content categorization in large and heterogeneous text collections. Biclustering, a form of coherent concept analysis, is suggested to tackle the limitations of FCA since it explores all potentially relevant information available in vector spaces by focusing the searches on less-trivial, yet meaningful and statistically significant concepts. Pattern-based biclustering searches are suggested since they hold unique properties of interest: efficient exploration; optimality guarantees; discovery of concepts with parameterizable coherence; tolerance to noise and missing data; incorporation of domain knowledge; complete biclustering structures without positioning restrictions; and sound statistical testing. Results from a real corpus confirm the unique role of biclustering in finding relevant associations between topics and documents. Results further evidence the ability to unveil interpretable concepts with guarantees of statistical significance and robustness, thus providing a trustworthy context with enough feedback for content categorization in large text collections.",
