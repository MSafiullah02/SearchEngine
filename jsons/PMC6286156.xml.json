            "text": "Ca2+ signals originating from the \u2018acidic\u2019 Ca2+ stores of endosomes and lysosomes regulate a steadily growing list of cellular and developmental processes [1]. One important endolysosomal Ca2+ release pathway is activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a potent Ca2+ releasing second messenger in many cells and tissues [[1], [2], [3]]. NAADP mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ stores by engaging the activity of members of the two-pore channel (TPC) family ([[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]], but see [10,11]). TPCs are broadly expressed ion channels and evolutionarily ancient members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily [12,13]. Their identification and subsequent study has facilitated resolution of many pathophysiology processes dependent upon endolysosomal Ca2+ release [[14], [15], [16]]. For example, using knockdown or knockout approaches, a role for TPCs has been shown during viral infectivity [17], Parkinson disease [18], muscle function and development [11,[19], [20], [21]], late-onset obesity [22] and susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [23]. Such discoveries prioritize the importance of identifying small molecule modulators of TPC- and NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathways as research tools and perhaps, over the longer term, as a therapeutic avenue. For example, the natural product tetrandrine recently identified as a TPC blocker and inhibitor of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling improved survival in mice infected with Ebola [17]. Modulators of NAADP-dependent signaling have been shown to be effective against other eukaryotic pathogens [24] and viral infections [17,25] as well as regulators of neoangiogenesis [26,27].",

First, compounds that generally perturb the mobilizable, organellar Ca2+ pool (e.g. bafilomycin, a vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor and various lysosomal disruption agents [28,29]). Second, agents that interfere with NAADP binding, including trans-Ned-19 (a member of a NAADP conformer series identified by virtual screening, [30]) and the nucleotide mimetics PPADS and PPNDS [31]. Third, agents that act as TPC pore blockers, including Cav channel antagonists (diltiazem, nifedipine, <10 u M [13,32]) and possibly tetrandrine (sub-micromolar range [17] and structurally-related derivatives [25]. Finally, a flotilla of other compounds working through the above mechanisms that have inhibitory actions over a range of tens of micromolar. These include alkyl pyridinium analogs (IC50 \u223c15\u03bcM, [33]) Nav blockers (IC50 >100\u03bcM, [13]) and naringenin (IC50 \u223c180\u03bcM, [27]). Overall, there is scope for identifying an improved pharmacopeia of selective, potent modulators of the NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release pathway.",

            "text": "One approach for executing an unbiased screening campaign targeting NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ signaling is based upon interrogation of Ca2+ release responses in the sea urchin egg homogenate system, the preparation in which the Ca2+ releasing activity of NAADP (and cyclic ADP ribose, cADPR) was first discovered [34,35]. The sea urchin egg homogenate system represents a simple, yet robust preparation [36]: it is an easily prepared cell-free system that, within each independent preparation, provides reproducible and robust responsiveness to multiple Ca2+-releasing second messengers (NAADP, cADPR and IP3) within a minaturizable, high signal-to-noise, room temperature assay. Homogenate can be prepared in bulk, and stored as frozen aliquots which remain responsive for many years. For all these reasons, the system has long been regarded as the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 for studying NAADP action [34,35], and has been frequently used to assess the action of molecules eliciting Ca2+ release through each of the discrete, endogenous Ca2+ mobilization pathways [13,30,32,33,[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]]. Although the system is clearly amenable to high throughput profiling, no screening campaign has, to our knowledge, yet been reported. This is surprising given the many advantages of this preparation, not in the least the intrinsic sensitivity to the three Ca2+-releasing second messengers that permits counter-screening of small molecule specificity. Here, we have performed a pilot screen for novel modulators of NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release in the sea urchin egg homogenate system and assessed tractability of the resulting \u2018hits\u2019 against both endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca2+ responses and a pseudotyped MERS-CoV translocation assay in human cell lines [25].",

Compounds were preincubated with homogenate for 6 min (1st addition) during which fluorescence readings were monitored, followed by a single subsequent addition of NAADP (167 nM, 2nd addition). The positive control was NAADP itself (1st addition, Fig. 2C), known to self-desensitize the sea urchin NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release pathway [46]. The negative control was dual additions of vehicle (Fig. 2D). These positive (NAADP) and negative vehicle (DMSO) controls were run in parallel for each plate. The robustness of the screening platform was assessed by calculating the Z\u2019 factor (Z\u2019), a widely employed indicator of assay quality in screening applications [47]. Z\u2019 values over 0.5 are considered a prerequisite for executing reliable higher throughput screens. Calculations of Z\u2019 were therefore made using peak fluorescence values during the NAADP-evoked Ca2+ mobilization response after initial preincubation with vehicle control versus dual vehicle additions (Fig. 2D), averaging 8 replicate wells within a 96 well plate. Using this protocol, Z\u2019 = 0.73 \u00b1 0.12, an acceptable value defining assay conditions for subsequent experiments.",

Compounds that caused changes or elevations of baseline fluorescence values during the preincubation period were also excluded from subsequent analysis, one example being the ionophore A23187 (Fig. 3). Another example was the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin, which depleted the ER Ca2+ content, but did not abrogate NAADP responsiveness from the acidic Ca2+ stores (Fig. 3C). Also excluded were known modulators of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling such as thio-NADP (known to contain contaminating NAADP [48], Fig. 3C). Following this pruning, a top cohort of 18 putative inhibitors was prioritized and ranked (#1, PF-543 through #18, trifluoperazine; Fig. 3D).

Representative curves are shown in Fig. 4\nA, and IC50 values for each compound are collated in Table 1. Each of the eighteen prioritized candidates elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release, validating the robustness of the primary screen. IC50 values spanned from low micromolar (e.g. racecadotril, IC50 = 1.6 \u00b1 0.1\u03bcM) to tens of micromolar, a range that compares favorably with data obtained with currently used inhibitors of NAADP evoked Ca2+ signals, including PPADS (IC50 = 5.4 \u00b1 0.2\u03bcM) and the lower potency of commercially sourced trans-ned-19 in our hands (156 \u00b1 3\u03bcM, but compare with [30]). A recently proposed TPC2 inhibitor - naringenin [27] \u2013 also displayed little inhibitory activity in this system. The selectivity of inhibition of the NAADP pathway was assessed by monitoring effects of the same candidate (30\u03bcM) on IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals, cADPR-evoked Ca2+ signals and NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals. Representative compounds in this assay are shown in Fig. 4B. Finally, the effects of compound on 32P-NAADP binding was also examined, as one potential mechanism for inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ responses. Except for NAADP and the positive control PPADS, none of the compounds displayed significant inhibition of 32P-NAADP binding in sea urchin egg homogenates (Fig. 4C). These data were also consistent with a failure of the candidates to displace a photoaffinity probe [8,45,[52], [53], [54]] from the NAADP receptor binding protein in mammalian U2OS cell extracts (data not shown).",

            "text": "Next, the effects of the candidate drugs on lysosomal number and Ca2+ content were assessed by simultaneously monitoring changes in LysoTracker\u00ae fluorescence and cytoplasmic Ca2+ following addition of GPN (glycyl-L-phenylalanine-2-naphthylamide). GPN causes lysosomal permeabilization and Ca2+ release, concomitant with loss of LysoTracker\u00ae staining intensity [55,56]. Decreased lysosomal Ca2+ content in drug-treated samples relative to controls assessed after GPN addition, or decreases in LysoTracker\u00ae signals on initial drug addition (\u2018lysosomotropism\u2019 [28,29]) were regarded as more generalized actions of the drug candidates on the lysosomal Ca2+ stores distinct from activity against the NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release pathway. Representative traces showing ratios (F/Fo) of green (fluo-4) and red (LysoTracker\u00ae) fluorescence signals over time are shown in Fig. 5\nA for several of the candidates (examples lacking and displaying effects) and controls (vehicle, no GPN, bafilomycin and a protease inhibitor cocktail to impair GPN action). Several of the candidate drugs (for example, prochlorperazine and trifluoperazine in Fig. 5A) caused a rapid decrease in LysoTracker\u00ae staining (Fig. 5A, bottom) and a decrease in mobilizable lysosomal Ca2+ content on GPN addition (Fig. 5A, top). These effects were related, with a strong observed correlation between loss of LysoTracker\u00ae staining and GPN-evoked Ca2+ transient amplitude (Fig. 5B). Data from the portfolio of all 18 candidates are shown in Fig. 5B, identifying three broad groupings \u2013 (i) compounds with no effect on LysoTracker\u00ae or GPN signal intensity, clustering with negative controls (water, DMSO; boxed in Fig. 5B), (ii) compounds with penetrant effects on both LysoTracker\u00ae and GPN signal intensity (the positive control bafilomycin, and several phenothiazines: prochlorperazine (rank #9), thioridazine (rank #10) and trifluoperazine (rank #18) and (iii) a group of 8 compounds with a profile intermediate between these groupings (\u223c30-50% decrease in fluorescence ratio versus controls). Only the seven candidates with no effect on GPN-mobilizable Ca2+ or LTR staining - the first grouping, PF-543 (rank #1), SKF96365 (rank #2), racecadotril (rank #5), A-315456 (rank #6), LY-310,762 (rank #12), PDMP (rank #15) and salmeterol (rank #16) - were advanced for further validation. The remaining 11 candidates were not pursued further in the context of this study (shaded rows in Table 1).",

These experiments were performed by monitoring Ca2+ release kinetics following microinjection of NAADP into single cells (Fig. 6\n). Whereas injection of buffer alone evoked only a small stimulus artefact, injection of NAADP evoked a robust Ca2+ transient (peak F/Fo = 4.0 \u00b1 0.6, n = 3 injections, Fig. 6A). The action of NAADP was then examined in cells preincubated with the candidate inhibitors (10\u03bcM, 10 min pretreatment), as well as other compounds of interest. PPADS \u2013 the positive control NAADP inhibitor from sea urchin assays [31] - decreased the amplitude of the NAADP-evoked Ca2+ transient to 24.2 \u00b1 2.1% of control values (Fig. 6A). However, neither ned-19, nor naringenin significantly attenuated Ca2+ signal amplitude following NAADP microinjection (Fig. 6A). Examination of each candidate inhibitor revealed varying degrees of inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ responses under the preincubation conditions (10\u03bcM) with the most effective compounds being SKF96365 (12.4 \u00b1 8.9% of control values), PF-543 (14.1 \u00b1 3.0% of control values) and racecadotril (16.6 \u00b1 10% of control values). These compounds were highly ranked in the sea urchin screen (SKF96365 (rank #2), PF-543 (rank #1) and racecadotril (rank #5)) and compared well with PPADS (24.2 \u00b1 2.1% of control values). PDMP (rank #15) caused the lowest extent of inhibition (43.7 \u00b1 15.0% of control values) which was none-the-less still a considerable improvement over both ned-19 and naringenin in our hands.",

The unbiased screening approach described here generated an additional panel of inhibitors of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, the potential effectiveness of these compounds in the MERS pseudovirus infectivity assay was assessed. Results from this MERS pseudovirus bioassay were plotted along with the Ca2+ release inhibition data in Fig. 6B. Visual inspection of the results from both datasets revealed a strong correlation between results from these independent assays, further supporting the conclusions of the companion paper that ligands targeting the NAADP pathway inhibit MERS pseudovirus translocation [25], while highlighting new scaffolds for manipulation of NAADP-dependent signaling processes in mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Here, we prioritized candidates showing \u226580% inhibition of the peak NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signal. This comprised eighteen candidates, seven of which progressed through validation in subsequent assays. This \u2018hit\u2019 proportion (\u223c0.5% from 1534 compounds) is consistent with discovery rates observed in other screens, and is especially agreeable given the low execution cost for the urchin screening platform. Prior reticence to use this system for unbiased screening may have related to concern over tractability of structure-activity relationships from the urchin to human pathways. Differences in sensitivities between sea urchin and mammalian systems have previously been noted for structural analogs of NAADP [42] implying differences in NAADP binding protein specificity [45,52]. However, this relates to finer structure-activity relationships within defined chemical series, rather than discovery of new scaffolds. While obviously data reflects the sensitivities and specificities of an invertebrate Ca2+ release system, the utility of C. elegans and Drosophila as drug screening models is noted [57]. In our opinion, the advantages of high assay throughput in the sea urchin system offsets the need for subsequent validation of \u2018hits\u2019 against NAADP-evoked responses in human cells. Even so a similar ordering of potency was ultimately observed between the sea urchin and human cell bioassays: SKF96365, PF-543 and racecadotril were the most penetrant inhibitors in both systems (Fig. 4, Table 1). Identification of these three novel hits (Table 1) that (i) inhibited Ca2+ release by >80% in a human cell line, more than seen with tetrandrine under identical conditions [25], (ii) reduced MERS pseudovirus translocation to levels observed with fangchinoline (Fig. 1, [58]), and (iii) lacked demonstrable action in the counterscreen provides strong support for execution of a higher throughput screening campaign using sea urchin egg homogenate. Screening large compound libraries against endogenous NAADP-evoked signals mediated via TPCs within their acidic store native environment in mammalian cells would be a much more daunting prospect. Screens of TPCs targeted to the cell surface [59], or virtual screens based upon TPC recent structures [[60], [61], [62]] represent viable, complementary approaches.",

Numerous compounds and chemical scaffolds have been shown to accumulate within the acidic Ca2+ store lumen where they can modulate (e.g. functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase, FIASMAs [63,64]) or act as substrates of luminal enzymes [65] to alter the structure and/or function and even integrity of the lysosome (e.g. osmotic lysis by GPN). Examples of compounds dropped from the pipeline based on counter-screening assays, that are known to fall within this category [63,66] are multiple phenothiazine compounds (rank #3, #9, #10, #18), clemastine (rank #7) and dilazep (rank #11). These compounds display higher lipophilicity (average ClogP, 4.85) and basic pKa (average pKa, 8.9) than the remaining dataset. Other excluded compounds (GBR-12935, IPFME, ST-148, TMB-8 and oxybutynin) are new lysosomotropic suspects. This does not equate to a lack of usefulness as research tools, or even clinical drugs, as many approved therapeutics show marked lysosomotropism, a feature that may actually contribute to their clinical efficacy [63,67,68]. This is especially relevant for novel uses of existing clinical agents to target pathogens that traverse the endolysosomal system, where drug accumulation with acidic Ca2+ stores would be a desirable attribute for pathogen targeting [25,69]. Such activities may have good repurposing potential, but for our purposes here, inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release by these candidates is likely indirect.",

All inhibited NAADP evoked Ca2+ signals responses in the human cell line (Fig. 6) under conditions less penetrant than the counterscreen where no changes in lysosomal properties were observed (Fig. 5). The three top ranked hits - SKF96365, PF-543 and racecadotril \u2013 have not previously been shown to impair NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling. None of these compounds interfered with specific 32P-NAADP binding implying inhibition through other mechanisms (Fig. 4C). SKF96365 is a low voltage-activated T-type Cav blocker, with antagonist action at other Cavs and TRPC channels [50,51]. This polypharmacological profile may now extend to TPCs. Direct electrophysiological analysis will be needed to confirm if the observed inhibition of NAADP action in Ca2+-free extracellular media by SKF96365 (Fig. 6A) results from TPC pore blocking ability. Our data also suggest caution in attribution of the mechanistic basis of effects of SKF96365 in studies of Ca2+ signaling [70]. PF-543 is a cell-permeant inhibitor of sphingosine kinase [49], application of which causes a dose-dependent increases in cellular sphingosine levels. Elevated sphingosine levels attenuate acidic Ca2+ store signaling, as evidenced by impaired responses to NAADP in patients with Niemann-Pick type C1 disease [71]. This inhibition may be caused by sphingosine-dependent TPC1 activation [72], impaired lysosomal Ca2+ uptake and/or lysosomal permeabilization [65,71]. Action of PF-543 through any of these mechanisms would result in the observed inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals. Racecadotril (acetorphan) is a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (NEP), used therapeutically as an antidiarrheal agent by blocking enkephalin-mediated intestinal fluid secretion. It is also a prodrug, being rapidly converted to thiorphan, a low nanomolar NEP inhibitor. Inhibition of neprilysin (an amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide degrading enzyme) by infusion of thiorphan in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is associated with extensive lysosomal accumulation of A\u03b2 as well as changes in lysosomal number and size [73]. These data evidence lysosomal alterations which, as seen in other neurodegenerative models [18], dysregulate NAADP action. Further experiments will be needed to define mechanistically how these drugs impair NAADP action.",

Even though only a small number of compounds were profiled in this initial unbiased pilot screen, the effectiveness of the highly ranked compounds was as good as achieved through structure-activity based screening around the known tetrandrine scaffold (see companion study, [25]). These data provide strong support for execution of a higher throughput screening campaign using the sea urchin egg homogenate system to discover new ligands for manipulation of NAADP signaling, as well as for modulators of cADPR and IP3 action.",
