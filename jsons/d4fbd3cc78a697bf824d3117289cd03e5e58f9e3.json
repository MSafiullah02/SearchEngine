Williams and McNicol (1969) noted that respiratory catarrhal symptoms were commonly associated with earlier wheezing episodes, but with increasing age other factorsemotional disturbances, seasonal change, inhalant allergensbecame important precipitants. Halpern (1972) found that infection was responsible for 90% of attacks at two years, the proportion falling to about 20% at ten years. Wittig et al. (1959) found that 32% of children, mostly infants, who had had bronchiolitis subsequently developed asthma. With the infants of Zweiman et al. (1966, 1971) , the proportion was about half. An infection in infancy had apparently precipitated the first episode of asthma in those with an allergic diathesis. As the children grew older infection continued to be a common precipitant, but attacks were also set off by non-specific stimuli such as exertion, sudden weather changes and, later again, by inhalantsdust, danders and pollens. The proportion of the children that displayed sensitivity to extrinsic allergens by skin tests increased progressively with age.",

He postulated an interaction of viral antigens and serum antibodies in the lungs, that is, a Type 111 allergic reaction. Gardner et al. (1970) suggested that the bronchiolitis is the result of a second invasion of the infant by RSV, and that a Type I allergic reaction follows between the virus and reagins produced by the first attack. The eosinophilia in many young asthmatics (Wright, 1973) points to an allergic mechanism, although there may be no convincing evidence of an external allergen. Gregg (1972) has isolated rhinoviruses more frequently than any other type of virus in episodes of both upper and lower respiratory illness. In the majority of subjects liable to wheeze -that is those who have inherited or acquired bronchial hyperreactivity-rhinoviral infection was associated with an acute onset of wheeze or an exacerbation of chronic wheeze.",

However, the seasonal prevalence of asthma does not conform with the seasonal prevalence of the commonly recognised allergenshouse mites (Domrow, 1970) , fungi (Rees, 1964 (Rees, , 1966 , pollens (Moss, 1965 (Moss, , 1967 ) -review (Derrick, 1972) . The nonconformity with grass pollens is illustrated in Figure 10 . Further, in very young children, only a small proportion of asthma is caused by airborne allergens. In Adelaide, Ford ( 1963, 1969) found that extrinsic causes were dominant in 29% of those with the onset at 0-4 years (foods accounted for most of the extrinsic cases in infancy), in 56% at 5-14 years and 83% at 15-29 years. He noted that extrinsic causes were less common in hospital than in private patients.
