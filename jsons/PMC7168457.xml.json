Strangely enough, sales of this product actually increased in New Zealand during the SARS epidemic, with a BBC news website reporting that some people were asking, \u201cIs this a medicine for SARS or protection against SARS?\u201d.\n1\n In another report, a New Zealand spokesman for the manufacturer said that the company was not thinking of changing the name of the drink and was unlikely to do so if current sales trends continued.\n2\n The company also used to sell Double SARS, but I understand that this product has been discontinued.",
