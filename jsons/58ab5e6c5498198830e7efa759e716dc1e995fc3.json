Sixty-nine percent of the participants announced the trainings helped them reduce the disease-borne stress and how to mitigate the virus's impacts. Comparing the online training methodology with ordinary ones, 82% of the participants declared the first is safer with regard to the disease outbreak. The participants asked for a question and answer section, which was added as off-line access later on. Following the outbreak in China and later in Iran, the infographic contents circulation indicates exponential growth in sharing of the materials among the public on the Web, social media, and popular applications. The comments by users indicated 86% satisfaction. Some comments (12%) expressed the infographics are autonomously placed in apartments, companies, and organizations. The feedback from the public expressed that those materials, including videos containing humor, animation, and kid-friendly themes, are viewed more and had possibly higher effectiveness than those with a monolog lecture format. These contents were more attractive to different genders and age groups.",

Paying attention to the social vulnerabilities, livelihoods, and post-Corona social, psychological, and economic crises are the most challenging concerns that must be later taken into consideration.

Timely risk identification and designing an educational protocol regarding the widespread outbreak of the virus, and provision of proactive, timely, and effective public education should be considered as well. The widespread acceptance and rapid dissemination of messages generated in cyberspace and a high number of visitors reflect the effective and timely use of this space to solve these health problems. However, new educational technologies and applications and the capacity of national and private media should also be taken into account. Simple, functional, and free online courses should be available to everyone; user-friendly for the illiterate and disabled should also be considered. In addition, the comments by users and visitors on modifying and updating training messages increase the effectiveness of the training method. The educational content in different media formats can be developed and dedicated to the age of the target audience to enhance learning effectiveness. Training enhances the people's proper readiness and response to the virus; so, to manage the virus, policy-makers in the health system and all organizations involved should take steps in providing innovative, unified, and applied educational content to all people. It is also important and socially responsible for organizations and the people in these educational contexts to promote community resiliency.",
