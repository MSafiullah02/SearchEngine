TMUV-infected ducks and geese exhibit a rapid drop in egg production and daily food intake. The sudden outbreak and fast spread of TMUV have caused heavy economic losses in the major waterfowl-breeding provinces of China since 2010. Concerningly, the range of TMUV hosts is expanding. In addition to ducks and geese, chickens, pigeons and house sparrows can be infected by TMUV. Therefore, TMUV has a severe impact on development of the domestic poultry industry (Chen et al., 2016, 2017b; Zhang et al., 2017).",

            "text": "The whole TMUV genome encodes three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. Among these viral proteins, the envelope (E) protein is located on the surface of mature virions and forms head-to-tail homodimers (Kuhn et al., 2002). The E protein consists of an ectodomain (containing three domains: DI, DII and DIII) and a stem-transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the membrane. The first step in the process by which TMUV enters host cells is binding of the E protein to cellular receptors on the cell surface (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010). To date, several cellular receptors have been identified; these include glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) on BHK-21 cells, heat shock protein A9 on DF-1 cells and heparin sulfate on both BHK-21 and duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) (Zhao et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). These receptors play an important role in the first step of TMUV entry and viral attachment. Subsequently, attached TMUV enters cells by the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, after which endocytic vesicles carrying the virus are delivered to endosomes (Smit et al., 2011). Under the low-pH conditions of the endosome, the E homodimer dissociates into monomeric proteins, exposing the fusion loop in DII. Subsequently, the fusion loop inserts into the target membrane, and three copies of the E protein interact to form the E protein trimer. DIII then folds back against the trimer, directing the E stem anchor towards the fusion loop. The energy released by these conformational changes induces fusion between the viral membrane and host cell membrane. Finally, a fusion pore is formed, and delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cytosol initiates replication (Pierson and Kielian, 2013).",

DN59, an inhibitory peptide corresponding to the stem region of dengue virus (DENV) E protein, almost completely inhibited DENV infection in LLC-MK2 cells and exhibited cross-inhibitory activity against West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The WN83 inhibitor, a direct mimic of DII of the WNV E protein, reproducibly inhibited WNV infectivity at a low-\u03bcM concentration (Hrobowski et al., 2005). The inhibitory peptide Z2, which was synthesized based on the stem region of the Zika virus (ZIKV) E protein, could penetrate the placental barrier of pregnant ICR mice and inhibit vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice (Yu et al., 2017). The peptide P5, derived from the stem region of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) E protein, could block JEV and ZIKV infection in vitro. P5 also protected mice from JEV-induced lethality and reduced ZIKV-induced histopathological damage by decreasing viral load (Chen et al., 2017a). Moreover, DN59 and 1OAN1 could inhibit antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)-mediated DENV infection in vitro, suggesting peptide inhibitors as a strategy to inhibit flavivirus ADE (Nicholson et al., 2011).",

In this study, the peptides TP1 and TP2 derived from DII and the stem region of the TMUV E protein, respectively, were synthesized, and their ability to prevent TMUV infection was investigated. The data demonstrated that TP1 inhibited TMUV infection through destroying the integrity of the viral particles, while both TP1 and TP2 exerted inhibitory effects by interfering with the binding of TMUV to cells. Additional results suggested that TP2 cross-inhibited JEV infection. These findings provide new insight into the development of drugs against TMUV.",

The qRT-PCR results showed that both peptides inhibited TMUV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with TP1 or TP2 at a concentration of 10 mg/L led to slightly decreased virus production, but these differences were not statistically significant. However, incubation with 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L TP1 or TP2 caused a significant decrease in virus production. Compared with negative peptide treatment, the virus production following 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L TP1 treatment was decreased by 21.3% and 44.6%, respectively. Similarly, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L TP2 treatment reduced virus production by 37.4% and 53.4%, respectively. The results of the plaque assay and western blot analysis were similar to those obtained by qRT-PCR. In addition, the IC50 values suggested that TP2 derived from the stem region exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect than TP1 derived from DII (Fig. 1E). As expected, the negative peptide did not show an inhibitory effect. A toxicity assay was conducted to exclude the possibility that the antiviral effects of the two peptides were due to underlying cytotoxicity. The results showed no significant differences between BHK-21 cells with or without the peptides, suggesting that the two peptides are non-toxic at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 1F).

Liu et al. (2013) reported TMUV ADE when anti-TMUV antibody levels were low. Earlier studies in our laboratory indicated that duck anti-TMUV serum could enhance infection in duck peripheral blood lymphocytes, with this effect peaking with anti-TMUV serum (with a neutralizing antibody titre of 1:64) diluted 1:100 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4\n, anti-TMUV serum diluted 1:100 facilitated infection in duck peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, incubation of anti-TMUV serum mixed with TP1 or TP2 inhibited ADE in a concentration-dependent manner. Although the inhibitory peptides did not block ADE completely, treatment with TP1 or TP2 led to a significant reduction in virus production compared with that following treatment with the negative peptide. Although TP1 and TP2 inhibited TMUV ADE, the two peptides showed no cytotoxic effect on duck peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig. 4C).",

This insertion resulted in the formation of holes in the viral membrane or disrupted the membrane bilayer structure. Subsequently, negatively charged genomic RNA escaped from the viral particles. Similarly, the binding of Z2 to the E protein inactivated ZIKV by disrupting the integrity of the ZIKV membrane (Yu et al., 2017). An RNase digestion assay showed that TMUV treated with TP1, but not TP2, was sensitive to RNase digestion, indicating disruption of the viral membrane and the escape of genomic RNA from viral particles. However, the underlying mechanism by which TP1 disrupts the viral membrane is still unclear. As described in previous studies, possible explanations are hydrophobic and electrostatic effects or viral dynamic \u201cbreathing\u201d, but determining this mechanism lies beyond the scope of this study.",

This structural deformation probably interfered with cell binding. Alhoot et al.

TP1 and TP2 are likely to interfere with viral attachment by a mechanism similar to that described above.

This phenomenon increases the challenge in developing an effective and safe vaccine to provide protection against TMUV. TP1 and TP2, which show inhibitory activity against ADE, are probably favourable for the inoculation of infected ducks and geese without the concern of ADE. In addition, unlike most small-molecule antiviral drugs, the nontoxicity of TP1 and TP2 also ensures the safety of these peptide inhibitors for antiviral therapy. However, why TP1 and TP2 inhibit TMUV ADE is still unclear. Yu et al. (2017) reported that the inhibitory peptide Z2 interacted with the E protein of ZIKV and caused viral genomic RNA release, eventually resulting in the inactivation of ZIKV virions. It is presumed that the binding of TP1 to TMUV inactivates TMUV virions and hence relieves ADE-mediated TMUV infection. In addition, TP1 and TP2 were shown to interfere with the cellular binding of TMUV. It is possible that these two inhibitory peptides block ADE by reducing viral binding to cells.
