This article provides an overview of emerging infectious diseases in general and discusses some examples of viral pathogens that are currently cause for concern, including West Nile virus (WNV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. It also lays the foundation for discussions about the implications of emerging infectious diseases for the safety of the blood supply and for the care of patients who depend on the safety of the blood supply, such as those with haemophilia.",

Over the last 150 years as the global population has increased dramatically, the length of time required to circumnavigate the globe has decreased dramatically (Fig. 1) [4]. International travel and commerce have affected the size and mobility of human populations, bringing some environments, humans and other animal species into contact with each other for the first time. These changing human demographics may enable an infectious agent to become adapted to and disseminated within a new host population, often resulting in an expansion of the agent's geographic range [5].

It is uncertain how WNV spread to the USA. It has been hypothesized that the strain in the USA was transported in an infected bird illegally imported from the Middle East or Central Europe where the disease had previously been endemic. Mosquito transmission subsequently resulted in transmission to birds, horses and humans in the USA. After its initial appearance in New York City in 1999, WNV spread to the lower 48 states in the US in <2 years [6].",
