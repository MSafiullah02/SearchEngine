According to experts the number of people who can lose their jobs in various sectors are between 12.3 million and 18.5 million [19]. Although, Pakistan as a fragile and indebted economy has come up to the rescue of its vulnerable people with a multi-trillion-rupee relief package, allocating 200 billion rupees for the labour class. Under the package, some 10 million people, categorized under low-income groups, will get a lump sum amount of 12,000 PKR, initially for a period of four months in the form of Ehsaas Emergency Cash Program [20]. However, this amount is lower than the daily wages they were getting before lockdown [19]. These economically pressured masses don\u2019t have much to spend on their health especially when the public hospitals have closed their OPDs for the general public. With no were to go and no money to spend, they access their nearby pharmacies which can get them medical advice without paying for consultation and they only have to pay for the medicine if it\u2019s needed.
