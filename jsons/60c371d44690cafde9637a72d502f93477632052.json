The most severely affected regions are also the regions where healthcare services have always been considered excellent; the hospitals of Lombardy and Veneto are the Italian centers of excellence with regard to standard protocols and management for many diseases, especially neoplastic conditions, and there was a high rate of passive migration of patients from the South to northern hospitals.",

In Italy, the lethality rate is 9%, which peaks in Lombardy (>10%), whereas the lethality rate in Wuhan was 5.8% and remained <1% in the rest of the People's Republic of China 4 . An initial rationale for the higher lethality rate could be the high average age of the Italian population when compared to, for example, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea; in the latter, the majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases are young women (62%), with 30% of positive cases in the age range of 20-30 years.

In Italy, data from the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS) indicates that 1% of the patients who died had no other disease, 26% had 1 disease, 26% had 2 disease, and 47% had 3 or more conditions. The most common chronic preexisting disease in the patients who died was arterial hypertension (76%), followed by ischemic heart disease (37%), atrial fibrillation (26%), and active cancer within the previous 5 years (19%) 4 .",

As recently reported by Li et al., the transmission rate from unreported infections was 55% of the rate of reported infections, and un-reported infections resulted in 79% of reported cases (1). Therefore, for each positive COVID-19 case, there are \u223c8-10 undetected cases; thus, the actual number of COVID-19 cases could be up to 10 times higher, and recalculation of the mortality rates on this basis would cause the actual national mortality rate of COVID-19 to decrease approximately to the mortality rates of COVID-19 in the People's Republic of China.",

Certainly, as has been reiterated by the Italian government several times in the previous 2 weeks, it is necessary to limit the infection spread by not going out unless for work. On March 21, the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced the closure of all non-essential production activities. However, activities essential to guarantee essential goods and services continue to remain operational. The Minister of Health has passed a new ordinance that increases the restrictions imposed on citizens wherein outdoor activities and visits to parks and gardens are prohibited 7 . Furthermore, restaurants and bars had already been closed until the end of March 2020 6 . Some regions of southern Italy have passed ordinances that prohibit, with immediate effect and until April 14, 2020, any movement of persons entering and leaving these regions. For example, one can only enter or leave the Calabria and Campania Regions for journeys deriving from verified essential requirements related to the provision of essential services or for serious health reasons. In light of the potential exposure to infection, an immediate measure of a 14-day quarantine will apply for those who violate these restrictions 8 . 2) Increase ICU beds and create new hospitals. For this, the President of the Campania Region, Vincenzo De Luca, worried about the deterioration in southern Italy, has announced the forthcoming construction of two new modular hospitals in Napoli and Caserta. They will be a sort of \"field\" hospital, consisting of containers and blocks which will form the body of the hospitals, with 48 added beds; other intensive care places were obtained by reconverting hospitals, in some cases ones that were previously closed. Three thousand additional beds will be recovered from private clinics 9 . ",

The mortality rate in Italy is higher because asymptomatic cases are not being tested and isolated. At the beginning of the epidemic, there was misinformation that asymptomatic cases did not transmit the virus. This statement is certainly incorrect, and the recognition of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases could decrease the number of infections (1). Numerous regions of Central and Southern Italy have communicated a decision to screen doctors and nurses even if they are asymptomatic 6,9 .",

Given that the most serious outcome of COVID-19 is pneumonia, the number of deaths could reflect the presence of fine dust in the air, especially in Lombardy, and the state of the average Italian lungs, which are damaged by cigarette smoke. The fact that more men have died may be attributed to a smoking habit, and those who smoke are more likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19. 7) Protect and monitor patients with comorbidities: These patients are at a greater risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and cancer patients should consider postponing adjuvant treatments, elective surgical interventions, or follow-up visits where possible 9 . To date, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, and it might take several months for any new vaccine to be developed. 8) Therapies. Various drugs have been used, including antivirals (e.g., favipiravir, arbidol, remdesivir) and antimalarials (e.g., chloroquine) (2), or tocilizumab in patients with high levels of interleukin 6 (IL6) and extensive bilateral pulmonary lesions or severe symptoms. The Italian Drug Agency (AIFA) has announced the authorization of the TOCIVID-19 study, which will assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of pneumonia in COVID-19. The above-mentioned study will evaluate the impact of tocilizumab (approved for rheumatoid arthritis), which has recently been reported to have conferred possible benefits on patients treated by Dr. Paolo Ascierto. In the TOCIVID-19 trial, 330 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia with early signs of respiratory failure or who were intubated and placed on ventilatory treatment within the previous 24 h will be treated with tocilizumab 10 .",
