Although many of these emerging conditions appear in the literature as case reports or case series, these sentinel cases frequently raise the public awareness that drives social movements or, in some situations, represent a warning sign for subsequent outbreaks. The emerging environmental and occupational lung diseases (EOLD) may be grouped arbitrarily into two categories: (1) conditions caused by novel utilization or routes of exposure to agents known to cause EOLD and (2) conditions caused by novel agents not known to cause speci fi c EOLD in the past. Conditions in the fi rst category may include those caused by new exposure scenarios in nonindustrial settings and thus a large population may be at risk. The second category includes new risk factor(s) that were not known to be associated with a speci fi c EOLD, and thus the association between the agent and the new condition could be easily missed.

These new exposure scenarios may occur in nonindustrial or environmental settings that potentially put a large population at risk. As such, the relationship between exposure and the lung conditions would not be easily identi fi able unless the individual is aware of their exposure, which is often not the case, and a detailed history regarding the potential for other exposures in the workplace, environment, or home is obtained. The conditions that are in this category include asthma induced by isocyanates in health care technicians working on casting material [ 1 ] , roof bolters involved in mining and tunneling [ 2 ] , in home occupants exposed to spray polyurethane foam (SPF) used as the \"environmental-friendly\" or \"green\" insulation materials [ 3 ] , by methacrylate in nail salon technicians [ 4 ] , and by cyanoacrylate in recreational glue users [ 5 ] . In the case of SPF, the inciting agents may also include amines, metal catalysts, and fl ame retardants in addition to isocyanates. Asthma has also been reported to be induced by linseed oil that is increasingly used as an environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-derived materials [ 6 ] . Recent reports of silicosis occurring in denim sandblasting workers in Turkey have also been noted [7] [8] [9] [10] . Jeans that are blasted with sand have a \"distressed,\" already worn look that has been quite popular since the 1990s. The silicosis noted in these workers showed a high incidence of progressive massive fi brosis and a high mortality with a 5-year survival rate of 69%, indicating high levels of exposure [ 10 ] . The Turkish government has since banned sandblasting, but it is likely that this practice and industry has moved to other countries-including Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, and Egypt, where the issue has received little attention. Similar to this altered work practice, accelerated cases of coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP) have been noted in younger coal miners working in smaller mines in eastern Kentucky and western Virginia and may be related to increasing production and longer work hours [ 11 ] . Several outbreaks of acute lung injury/pneumonitis related to water-repellant sprays have also been reported [ 12, 13 ] . This condition was associated with fl uoropolymers that are the key waterproo fi ng ingredient in leather protectants, such as boot sprays, or grout and fl oor sealants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 730, "end": 735, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 784, "end": 789, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 920, "end": 925, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 970, "end": 975, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1031, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1330, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1435, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1439, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1443, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1760, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2256, "end": 2262, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2374, "end": 2379, "text": "[ 12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2384, "text": "13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conditions Caused by Novel Routes of Exposure to Agents Known to Cause Environmental and Occupational Lung Diseases"}, {"text": "As new agents are constantly being introduced into the workplace and other environments, more EOLDs are to be expected (Table 15 .1 ). Compared to those in the fi rst category, there are many more emerging lung conditions that belong to this category. With the continued advance in technology, more risk factors for EOLD will likely be identi fi ed in the future. Some examples of agents that cause occupational asthma include synthetic machine cooling fl uids [ 14, 15 ] , N -propyl-acrylamide and acrylate tints on thermal paper printed from point-of-sale terminals, chamomile fl ower, a medicinal agent with sedative and anti-in fl ammatory properties [ 16 ] , and a peptide coupling reagent [ 17 ] ; occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by phytase enzymes in animal feed industry [ 18 ] ; lymphocytic bronchiolitis in nylon workers ( fl ock-worker's lung); and bronchiolitis obliterans caused by diacetyl in fl avoring industry workers and in consumers exposed to butter-fl avored microwave popcorn [19] [20] [21] . More recently, several studies have reported constrictive bronchiolitis in deployed soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan [ 22 ] and acute eosinophilic pneumonia among US military personnel deployed in or near Iraq [ 23 ] . Many soldiers who developed constrictive bronchiolitis had exposure to smoke from a sulfur mine fi re and burn pits, although a fi rm causal relationship has not yet been established.

Dendriform pulmonary ossi fi cation as a new form of \"rare earth (cerium) pneumoconiosis\" was reported in a crystal factory polisher whose workplace was heavily contaminated with greenish polishing powder [ 27 ] . There is concern that recent introduction of a nanoparticulate cerium oxide-based additive to diesel fuel in United Kingdom may carry a larger environmental risk to general public [ 28, 29 ] , although no human cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported to date. Pulmonary fi brosis and pleural granuloma were found in Chinese factory workers exposed to polyacrylate nanoparticles [ 30 ] . Carbon nanotubes were found in the lung of seven World Trade Center (WTC) responders who developed severe respiratory impairment or interstitial lung disease [ 31 ] . These man-made nanoparticles and nanotubes could represent a new threat to respiratory health since nanotechnology is being applied increasingly to the manufacture of many industrial products. Also included in this category are idiopathic lung diseases with newly identi fi ed causes. A cluster of 28 sarcoidosis cases was reported in responders of the WTC attack, further underscoring sarcoidosis as a potential environmental lung disease [ 32 ] .
