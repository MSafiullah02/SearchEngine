Inhospital options for treatment include transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP); a non-invasive means of temporarily pacing the heart.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 A systematic review of the prehospital literature suggested there was inadequate evidence to determine the efficacy of TCP in this setting.4 Despite the lack of evidence in the prehospital and emergency setting, the 2005 International Liaison Council of Resuscitation consensus document12 recommends the use of TCP for hemodynamically unstable bradycardia. Moreover, TCP capable defibrillators are currently approved for use in Canada and the United States and some EMS systems have adopted TCP as a standard of care.",

A meta analysis was not possible given the differences in study design.4 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to ascertain TCP effectiveness for hemodynamically unstable bradycardia in comparison to dopamine in the prehospital setting is probably justified; however, operational constraints in the prehospital setting can be challenging and often there are unanticipated logistical issues which may compromise the rigour of a randomized controlled trial. Before launching a prehospital trial in TCP, it is prudent to demonstrate that such a trial is feasible first.",

In practice it might not be possible to supply or keep ambulances stocked according to a predefined randomization schedule. Paramedics might find the study intervention too time-consuming to administer, or may lack confidence in it. Given the chaotic nature of the prehospital setting, even if paramedics are willing and able to randomize patients, allocation may not be distributed equally across the control and treatment groups. While TCP appears to be safe in the hospital environment,9, 13, 14 it might be less safe or less dependable in the field. Moreover, collecting reliable and valid data in this situation may be difficult. And finally, conducting the study with a waiver of consent is challenging in the US setting. A feasibility trial plays an important role before a main trial in revealing barriers and evaluating protocol design and providing justification for a larger study.15\n",

Atropine was withheld in patients presenting with 2nd degree AV block, type II or new 3rd degree block with wide QRS. If patients improved after the first dose of atropine they could continue to receive it each time they deteriorated, up to a maximum of 3 mg, as long as they continued to respond. If the blood pressure and heart rate or signs and symptoms failed to respond to any dose of atropine within 3 min of administration or reached the 3 mg maximum and met the inclusion criteria they were randomized. Patients randomized to the control group received dopamine in accordance with the current protocol for hemodynamically unstable bradycardia, i.e. starting at 5 \u03bcg/(kg min) and increasing the dose by 5 \u03bcg/(kg min) every 2 min until an improvement in signs and symptoms was observed, titrating to a maximum dose of 20 \u03bcg/(kg min).16 Patients in the treatment group received TCP in accordance with the current ACLS guidelines,16 i.e., 0.03 mg/kg midazolam was administered initially, the TCP rate was set at 80, and the current was set to its lowest setting (5 mA) and increased until mechanical capture was achieved as demonstrated by a palpable pulse with each paced beat. Paramedics were instructed to continue pacing at a current setting 10% higher than the threshold of mechanical capture.16 Patients in the treatment group who failed to respond to TCP crossed over to receive dopamine in the same manner as those in the control group.",

Only 39% met the inclusion criteria and of these only 98 or (65%) were able to receive TCP for practical reasons in the field for a variety of reasons not captured in the inclusion criteria. Hence a large multi-centre randomized controlled trial will be required to ascertain TCP effectiveness compared with dopamine in the prehospital setting and the inclusion criteria will need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect the target population most likely to receive the treatment. Randomization was executed successfully with 86% of eligible cases enrolled and the follow-up rate was 100%.

Eligible patients who were not enrolled were more likely than enrolled patients to present with a SBP between 80 mmHg and 100 mmHg with other signs and symptoms (change in GCS, chest pain, or crackles). As a result, there was insufficient time to enroll most of these patients as they required additional treatment by more than one medical directive. We did not consider these patients missed patients as the natural course of the illness precluded their receiving TCP or dopamine prior to arrival at hospital. It was within a paramedic's scope of practice to choose to treat with a medical directive prior to the research protocol if the treatment was felt to be more urgent than the treatment of the bradyarrhythmia. More importantly it is likely the paramedics would not apply TCP to any of these eligible patients practically in the field for the same reasons that they did not enroll them in the trial. The inclusion criteria should be adjusted to include only patients who meet eligibility prior to transporting the patient to the ambulance as there would be sufficient time to address other medical concerns and offer treatment for the bradyarrhythmia.",

The overall number of emergency calls declined during SARS for reasons that are poorly understood (personal communication, Alan Craig, Director, Toronto EMS, January 2005). Since the initial SARS case was treated and transported by paramedics, which resulted in the subsequent exposure of patients, receiving hospitals and other paramedics to the SARS virus, Toronto residents may have been reluctant to call 911 during this period of the study. Despite this decline, it appears that enrollment continued, suggesting that paramedic commitment to the study endured through challenging conditions.",

However, patients with a short length of stay before discharge were grouped with those with much longer stays; moreover, we were unable to determine whether they were subsequently readmitted to another institution. For the main trial, we recommend that survival to 30 days be used as the primary outcome, regardless of discharge status. This could be collected by direct telephone contact with the patient or the patient's next of kin and this planned contact could be outlined in the information letter with an option to withdraw from follow up. Where consent is required based on ethical guidelines and ethics board approval, consent for follow up could be obtained during the hospital stay. The cost of the trial would increase with in-hospital consent, particularly in sites with a large number of receiving hospitals, and it may be more challenging to acquire in patients who are discharged rapidly.",

In particular, the pre/post study intervention vital signs were difficult to collect, not so much because of case report form (CRF) design, but rather a lack of accompanying date/time stamp information on the source documents. Understandably, conditions in the field are not conducive to meticulous record keeping. There is often a delay between the time when paramedics attend to their patients and when they have a chance to complete the paperwork. On occasion paramedics are required to respond to another call before paperwork has been completed, thereby adding further to the delay. Nonetheless, rigorous abstraction rules can be used to at least make the abstraction process reliable and valid.23 The attending paramedics can be contacted for clarification and, based on our experience, are keen to help. The accuracy of data collection was augmented by a study-specific data checklist that captured the important variables and all source documents were subject to review by a central validation committee. It is recommended that future feasibility trials include reliability and validity coefficients as standard feasibility trial outcomes.",

Though some protocol refinements particularly to the inclusion criteria were recommended to ensure the protocol is practical and enhance the comfort with TCP for both the patient and paramedic, it was concluded that a trial of TCP in comparison to conventional treatment for hemodynamically unstable bradycardic patients is feasible in an urban, prehospital setting with a mature EMS system and medical control.
