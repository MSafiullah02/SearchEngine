Methods: We used suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and differential screening analysis to profile the mRNA expression patterns of children with CD and age-and sex-matched controls without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results: Sequence analysis of 1000 clones enriched by SSH identified 75 functionally annotated human genes, represented by 430 clones. The 75 genes have potential involvement in gene networks, such as antigen presentation, inflammation, infection mechanism, connective tissue development, cell cycle and cancer. Twenty-eight genes were previously described in association with CD, while 47 were new genes not previously reported in the context of IBD. Additionally, 29 of the 75 genes have been previously implicated in bacterial and viral infections. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on ileal-derived RNA from 13 CD and nine non-IBD patients confirmed the upregulation of extracellular matrix gene MMP2 (P = 0.001), and cell proliferation gene REG1A (P = 0.063) in our pediatric CD cohort. Conclusion: The retrieval of 28 genes previously reported in association with adult CD emphasizes the importance of these genes in the pediatric setting. The observed upregulation of REG1A and MMP2, and their known impact on cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, agrees with the clinical behavior of the disease. Moreover, the expressions of bacterial-and virus-related genes in our CD-patient tissues support the concept that microbial agents are important in the etiopathogenesis of CD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel. The cause of CD is unclear and a complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immune components has been implicated. 1 The prevailing hypothesis for the pathogenesis of CD is that an aberrant immune response, generated against microbial agents in genetically susceptible hosts, results in chronic intestinal inflammation. Thus far, 71 genes have been implicated in CD based on genome-wide association studies, and include genes involved in autophagy, maintenance of mucosal barrier integrity and immune regulation. 2, 3 The NOD2/CARD15 on chromosome 16 was the first locus implicated, mutations of which are thought to affect bacterial recognition. 4 Subsequently, four genes, IL10RA, IL10RB, PSMG1 and TNFRSF6B, have been linked to pediatric CD. 5, 6 The polygenic nature of CD suggests that direct targeting of individual disease susceptibility genes is unlikely to be therapeu-tically effective.

[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique provides a complementary, non-biased approach to the identification of new genes or pathogens associated with CD. In SSH, suppression PCR normalizes the representation of rare and abundant cDNA within the target population, and the subtraction step removes common nucleic acid sequences between the target specimen and its matched control. This results in an enriched pool of sequences specific to the target population. 15 The advantage of this approach is that no assumed knowledge of gene identity is required, as it does not rely on a defined set of gene library or conserved sequence signatures as probes for gene identification. 7 Hence SSH complements microarray studies by identifying potentially important genes that may not be represented on the array platforms utilized by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) microarray studies. SSH has been successfully used in the discovery of novel viruses, and the transcriptome profiling of human hepatoma and bone regeneration.

This was however contrary to a recent study comparing the expression of REG1A in the terminal ileum of adult CD and non-IBD controls, which reported a downregulation in REG1A expression. 13 The difference in REG1A expression could indicate a distinction between the pathogenesis of early onset CD and adult-onset CD. Based on the knowledge that REG1A gene expression is associated with cancer development, 59 the high level of REG1A expression in the terminal ileum of some CD pediatric patients could indicate an increased risk for colorectal cancer development. Individuals with early onset CD have been previously described to have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. 60 The increased levels of MMP2 observed in CD ileum are consistent with previous studies conducted on colonic tissue where MMP2 is highly expressed in the intestinal epithelia during IBD. 61, 62 Other studies have suggested the involvement of MMP2 in the regulation of epithelial barrier function. 25 Since epithelial barrier dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, the increased expression of MMP2 may serve as a response to counteract tissue damage, hence protecting against colitis. 63 The fluctuation in REG1A and MMP2 gene expression between ileal biopsies of different patients and also between biopsies taken at different ileal locations of the same patient, suggest a spatialtemporal nature of gene regulation during early CD pathogenesis.

Evidence of response to bacterial infection is reflected by the enrichment of receptors for adherent invasive Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori (CEACAM6, CD74). 28, 30 The enrichment of MMP2, SERPINA1, OTUD4, MACF1, PLS1, MUC17 and CLCA1 transcripts suggests the presence of infectious agent(s) early in disease pathway as these genes have previously been reported to be upregulated during bacterial or viral infections. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] The involvement of SLC5A1 and SF3B1 gene products in the impairment of intestinal glucose absorption and apoptosis due to HIV-1-induced glucose channel mis-sorting and cell cycle arrest suggest the occurrence of viral activities in early CD pathogenesis. 48, 50 The PSME2, PTMA, HLA-DRA, LRRC25 and XRN1 genes or gene products have been previously reported to be associated with defense against viral and bacterial infections.
