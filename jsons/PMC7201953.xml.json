Some evidence about those relative roles can be obtained by examining temporal changes in the proportions of different age groups among detected COVID-19 cases. Our results, based on applying the RR statistic [6,7] to data on COVID-19 cases in Germany [8] suggest that individuals aged 15\u201334 years (particularly the 20\u201324-year-olds) had their share in SARS-CoV-2 incidence increase with time compared with the 35\u201349-year-olds and children aged 10\u201314 years. Further work is needed to assess the reasons behind those relative increases, including the possibility of elevated mixing because of lesser adherence to physical distancing guidelines for persons aged 15\u201334 years.

Having the later period to be week 13 alone rather than weeks 13-14 has a very minor effect on the results of the paper (Supplementary material). We assess relative changes in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases in different age groups in Germany using data on detected (reported) COVID-19 cases [8]. The ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (case detection rate) in each age group may vary with time because of changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour and other factors. We believe that it is unlikely that the likelihood of seeking medical care/being tested increased substantially more for 15\u201334-year-olds than for 35\u201349- or 10\u201314-year-olds as the risk of severe disease is generally smaller in the former age groups compared to the latter. In addition, to address the possibility that testing practices during the early period focused on specific age or risk groups, we excluded week 9 from the early period and conducted sensitivity analyses (Supplementary material) with the early period assumed to be week 11 only (rather than weeks 10\u201311). In those sensitivity analyses, there was a further increase in RR for the 15\u201324 year age group, and the RR estimates in the 25\u201334 year age group remained higher than in age groups 35\u201349 and 10\u201314 years. All of this suggests that the observed temporal increases in the relative share of individuals aged 15\u201334 years among detected COVID-19 cases aged 10\u201349 years should be indicative of an actual increase in the prevalence of 15\u201334-year-olds among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population aged 10\u201349 years. In addition, data on mixing patterns in different age groups during regular times [2] suggest that those age groups are expected to have the largest role in driving the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Moreover, the age distribution of detected cases in South Korea [5] further supports our conclusion about the role of younger adults during SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Finally, because it is possible that symptomatic older adults and younger children may be more likely to seek medical care/get tested compared with other age groups as the awareness about the epidemic increases with time, those age groups were not included in our analyses based on the RR statistic.
