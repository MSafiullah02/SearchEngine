            "text": "It is well known that hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) are a significant source of morbidity, pain, patient dissatisfaction, and unnecessary increased cost in the hospital care of children. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] HAPIs can result in permanent damage to the skin and underlying tissues. A single HAPI has been shown to add approximately $43,180 to hospital care of a child. 3, 4 Other estimates indicate that the costs of HAPI in the United States could exceed $26.8 billion. 4 Despite being a preventable hospital-acquired condition (HAC), HAPIs occur in approximately 1.4% of hospitalized infants and children. [7] [8] [9] In children, HAPIs include both those related to immobility and medical devices. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Some reports show that up to 27% of patients in pediatric intensive care units experience HAPIs. 10 Following the HAPI prevention bundle (a group of actions which together have been shown to reduce the incidence of HAPI), individual hospitals demonstrated a reduction of serious harm. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) network recommends a 3-pronged approach to the identification and prevention of HAPI: (1) conduct active surveillance to detect pressure injuries, (2) implement and measure compliance with the HAPI prevention bundle, and (3) deployment of a wound ostomy nursing team. 1 Thirty-three hospitals that participated in the SPS phase 1 initiative to reduce HAPIs saw a statistically significant reduction in SPS-reportable HAPIs (stage 3, 4, and unstageable). These participating hospitals achieved an 80% compliance rate with the established HAPI prevention bundle. 1 Despite being a participating SPS children's hospital and having attempted implementation of the SPS HAPI prevention bundle, our hospital remained at a HAPI rate that was more than 3 times the mean for SPS participating Abstract Introduction: Despite being a participating Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) children's hospital and having attempted implementation of the SPS hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) prevention bundle, our hospital remained at a HAPI rate that was 3 times the mean for SPS participating children's hospitals. This performance led to the launch of an enterprise-wide HAPI reduction initiative in our organization. The purpose of this article is to describe the improvement initiative, the key drivers, and the resulting decrease in the SPS-reportable HAPI rate. Methods: We designed a hospital-wide HAPI reduction initiative with actions grouped into 3 key driver areas: standardization, data transparency, and accountability. We paused all individual hospital unit-based HAPI reduction initiatives. We calculated the rate of SPS-reportable HAPIs per 1,000 patient days during both the pre-and postimplementation phases and compared mean rates using a 2-sided t test assuming unequal variances. Results: The mean SPS-reportable HAPI rate for the preimplementation phase was 0.3489, and the postimplementation phase was 0.0609. The difference in rates was statistically significant (P < 0.00032). This result equates to an 82.5% reduction in HAPI rate. Conclusions: Having an institutional pause and retooled initiative to reduce HAPI with key drivers in the areas of standardization, data transparency, and accountability had a statistically significant reduction in our organization's SPS-reportable HAPI rate. (Pediatr Qual Saf 2020;5:e289; doi: 10.1097/ pq9.0000000000000289; Published online April 7, 2020.) children's hospitals. Specifically, the baseline rate of serious pressure injuries was 0.32 per 1,000 patient days when compared with the SPS benchmark mean rate of 0.09. Quality and nursing leaders paused all current unit-specific HAPI activities due to a lack of consistent bundle compliance and standards. We then launched an enterprise-wide HAPI reduction initiative. The purpose of this article is to describe the improvement initiative, the key drivers, and the resulting decrease in the HAPI rate. The goal of this improvement initiative was to reduce the SPS-reportable pressure injuries by 10% in the first year by implementing an action plan with key drivers determined by a causal analysis.",

Our institution utilizes deep dives after the occurrence of HAPIs (stage 3, 4, unstageable, and deep tissue injury) to identify modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that resulted in the HAPI occurrence. These deep dives require a team approach and involve the unit clinical nurse specialist, bedside nurses, unit management, and physicians, in coordination with the wound ostomy team. The deep dive process is completed partially by the unit and partly by the wound care team. The unit is responsible for following up with those who provided care for the patient and collecting information about factors that may have contributed to the event. The wound care team identifies the source of the injury through patient activities in the days before the event in conjunction with the location and severity of the injury. The wound team also looks at systemic issues or concerns that may have resulted in a higher likelihood of injury. With the newly designed process, for each SPSreportable HAPI, there is a deep dive investigation to evaluate potential deviations in care that contributed to the event. The deep dive involves review by both certified wound and ostomy nurses, as well as unit-based leaders. The wound care nurses serve as subject matter experts and identify the suspected cause of the injury, potential contributing factors, and deviations in standard care. The deep dive looks more broadly for additional risk factors and practice deviations, such as identifying what interventions were in use, the overall patient condition, Braden QD score, 7 and time in the operating room. Additionally, the deep dive identifies barriers to prevention efforts and steps that may prevent HAPIs in the future.",

The transparency of data from the individual patient level to the aggregate unit level allowed unit leadership and the wound care team to easily identify trends or gaps in the HAPI bundle elements and address them in real time. The Braden QD Scoring was also incorporated into the HAPI bundle round report in Epic for ease of use in the identification of patients at risk for HAPIs for unit leadership to more effectively target staff for bundle education rounds and allocate resources to the patients most at risk.",

For our fiscal year 2019 (September 2018-August 2019), HAPI reduction was a core quality and safety goal for the organization. This goal was a shift from prior years, where a HAC aggregate metric had been the focus of our organization. This shift in focus from a HAC aggregate to HAPI reduction resulted in significantly more attention and engagement in HAPI reduction efforts. Accordingly, inpatient units developed their own HAPI reduction goals, beginning in July 2018. An email was sent to all staff from the executive offices to commend units for their commitment to HAPI reduction, make staff aware of the planned organization-wide efforts to support HAPI reduction, and request that additional unit-based nonenterprise-wide interventions not be deployed without involvement of the enterprise-wide HAPI reduction team. We created a HAPI Oversight structure within our quality and safety governance structure. This structure included the creation of the enterprise-wide HAPI reduction team, monthly report outs from that team on the progress in standardization, data transparency, and accountability groups to the hospital HAC Steering Committee. It also included the establishment of a HAC Leadership Meeting in which the leaders of the enterprise-wide HAPI reduction teams reported out monthly on progress and barriers to quality and nursing leadership.By providing visibility to the HAPI reduction activities, the structure helped drive accountability and allow hospital leadership to provide resources or support when the team readily encountered barriers.",

The SkIPE team members, a unit-based resource for skin and wound concerns, ensured the use of appropriate prevention efforts, provided education for areas of individual practice deviation, and facilitated the implementation of nursing practice changes related to pressure injury prevention. As part of our improvement initiative, changes were made to improve the accountability of the SkIPE team by creating and enforcing clear expectations in terms of meeting attendance, activities on their units, and participation in pressure injury prevalence surveys. Additionally, the wound care team worked with individual unit managers to reinforce the accountability of SkIPE team member expectations.",

Despite our initial efforts to adhere to the SPS 3-pronged approach, 1 we were unsuccessful in reducing our baseline SPSreportable HAPI rate, and it remained well above the SPS average. Our institutional rate significantly decreased after we paused individual unit HAPI reduction efforts and implemented an organization-wide improvement initiative with key drivers in the areas of standardization, data transparency, and accountability with many action items in each of those areas that. Standardization provided 1 standard screening tool, clear alignment between bundle elements and interventions, and real-time education. Data transparency provided bedside clinicians visibility to HAPI bundle compliance rates and unit leadership a modality to compare bundle compliance with HAPI rate. The accountability provided clear strategic alignment across the organization, governance structure for oversight and implementation, and reset of the SkIPE team membership.",

First, as the HAPI reduction improvement initiative consisted of many different subinitiative action items which were launched in a staggered overlapping fashion, it is not possible to attribute which action items contributed the most to the HAPI reduction. Such a \"bundle\" approach is not uncommon with improvement initiatives. Related, the roll-out of the subinitiative actions occurred in a busy pediatric healthcare system with many competing other initiatives and projects. Therefore, because of issues with the timing of allocation of resources, such as information services, it was not possible or ever envisioned that all of the action plans would be enacted simultaneously. The actions were rolled out over time in an overlapping fashion. In this retrospective look back to review the effectiveness of the overall initiative, the point in time separating the preinitiative to the postinitiative time frames is somewhat arbitrary. July 1, 2018, was chosen for the reasons described in the Methods.",

The reduction of the HAPI rate by 82.5% well exceeded the initially established goal of a 10% reduction and was also statistically significant. This reduction shows not only a direct improvement in the care that we provide to children but has also had a positive impact on other processes. The HAPI reduction success was used as an example of an improvement project for our hospital's recent successful application for Magnet certification and also will have a positive impact on external evaluation processes such as the U.S. News and World Report process for ranking of children's hospitals. For all of these reasons, the success has been a source of pride for the staff and physicians who work in our healthcare system. We hope that success has also engaged our workforce so that they will be more apt to embrace other improvement initiatives launched in the future openly. Fig. 3 .
