Optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned before extubation or reintubation, and several strategies have been further suggested to reduce exposure to aerosols, such as covering the patient with plastic drapes or boxes, halting flow of oxygen before extubation, clamping the endotracheal tube, and use of suctioning devices.6 During an uncontrolled extubation, aerosolized viral particles might be forcefully coughed out, and many of these strategies to prevent exposure might not have been implemented, further increasing provider exposure risk. A forced extubation might also increase the travel distance of aerosolized particles. In addition, providers might not be wearing PPE if extubation was unplanned and emergent reintubation required. It is strongly recommended that providers don appropriate PPE before any airway procedure, no matter how emergent.",

In addition to UE, this type of intentional and controlled extubation due to endotracheal tube obstruction also places health care providers at increased risk of contamination.",

Adding to the known shortfall in the availability of mechanical ventilators, fewer critical-care-trained health care providers might be available to manage the increased numbers of intubated COVID-19 patients, thereby increasing the risk of accidental extubation, provider contamination, and both provider and patient morbidity and mortality.",

In addition, during any high-risk procedure such as proning or movement of the patient, one provider must be responsible for maintaining control of the endotracheal tube during the procedure. Increased awareness of circumstances that might increase the incidence of UE is important. Maintaining safe patient/provider ratios and using critical care providers when possible is also important. Becausethis has become challenging in COVID surge areas, increased awareness and education about UE and how to reduce risk to both patients and providers becomes even more vital. Clear communication and recognition of risk factors and strategies to reduce risk to both providers and patients can be incorporated into airway management protocols developed for COVID-19 patients. Optimal endotracheal restraint systems and processes for protecting the tube during high-risk procedures such as proning should be utilized, and medical personnel responsible for the care of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients must wear full PPE to protect them from contamination.",
