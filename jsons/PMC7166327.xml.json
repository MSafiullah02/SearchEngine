In Europe, the first few cases have been reported in Germany and France and most recently in Italy and Spain. The death toll from the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak is now 305 and the number of totals recovered 348. (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). In Italy, two cases have been registered in Rome, in a couple of Chinese tourists hosted in a Hotel placed in the center of the city. The Chinese tourists had arrived in Milan on 23 January 2020 from Wuhan, and thereafter they traveled to Rome. After relevant symptoms of coronavirus diseases, the couple has been admitted to Rome's Spallanzani Hospital, which is specialized in infectious diseases. In Italy, a state of emergency has been declared as a consequence of these two confirmed cases of infection that have been labeled as the first cases of Coronavirus transmission described in Italy.",

Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that Chinese tourists were probably infected before their arrival in Italy, since the viral strains sequences intermixed with Chinese isolates of the epidemic dating back probably to 19 January 2020 before their arrival in Italy. Furthermore, the Chinese tourist's viral strains isolated in Italy clustered with other European strains from France, and Germany intermixing with other Chinese sequences, thus suggesting that strains introduced in Europe up to day are from China. While the outbreak seems to be centered in Wuhan, China, the genomic analysis and the phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that Wuhan, acting as a source for 2019\u2010nCoV, or as stepping stone spot, favored viral dissemination to other areas in and outside the country, which might have been influenced by the increased human mobility. Here we showed evidence of likely imported cases from China in Rome, Italy, confirming that tourist mobility was responsible for virus isolation in Italy. In conclusion, our study shows that genomic data generated in real\u2010time can be employed to assist public health laboratories in monitoring and understanding the diversity of emerging viruses. In the globalization era characterized by high human mobility, this report suggests that the spread of a new epidemic is favored, rapidly reaching other countries even in other continents as we observed during the last days. Immediate quarantine and prompt action for infection control represent the best tools to avoid further spread of infection, as the Italian government provided.",
