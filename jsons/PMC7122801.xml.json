            "text": "The application of histological techniques and examination in forensic pathology is an unique and specialised aspect of pathology practice. Compared to clinical histopathology practice, in which similar techniques are applied, there are several notable differences. First, the nature of specimens varies significantly between forensic pathology practice and clinical histopathology practice. In clinical histopathology practice, specimens and biopsies generally comprise parts, fragments, or segments of various organs, and diagnoses are made from histological sections of tissues obtained through targeted sampling of the specimens, usually after adequate fixation. In contrast, the forensic pathologist routinely examines organs in their entirety and, in the first instance, in their unfixed state. The organs are quite often already in varying stages of autolysis and putrefaction. The starting point of histological sampling and examination is different from the outset. Second, the spectrum of organ and tissue examination varies between clinical histopathology practice and forensic pathology practice. In histopathology practice, small biopsies of the breasts, the aerodigestive tract, the female genital tract, etc. form an integral part of the workload. Biopsies of the many organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, brain, and kidneys often fall into areas of sub-specialised histopathology practice. In contrast, the forensic pathologist routinely examines entire hearts, lungs, livers, brain, and kidneys albeit with slightly a different focus and emphasis. While the breasts, intestines, and lymph nodes are also examined, less attention would be given to those compared to the major organs that are more often associated with the cause of death. The ability to identify macroscopic pathology in unfixed whole organs is an essential prerequisite in forensic pathology practice. Having said that, it is, naturally and nevertheless, necessary for the forensic pathologist to be able to recognise pathology in all organs, properly examine and report on them. Third, the emphasis of histological examination of surgical and clinical specimens is on diagnosis and prognostication. Marginal clearance in surgical specimens for neoplastic lesions is of vital importance in planning further and subsequent management. Specific grading, refined typing and classification of various neoplasms are also of primary significance in treatment and prognosis. In contrast, the main aim in the forensic postmortem examination is to properly determine the cause of death. Often the cause of death is obvious after macroscopic examination without any histological input. In these cases, all other factors, including incidental pathologies, may be considered to be of secondary or academic significance.",
