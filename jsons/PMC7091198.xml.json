Disease X would be a new disease with an epidemic or pandemic potential caused by an unknown pathogen (www.who.int/activities/prioritizing-diseases-for-research-and-development-in-emergency-context). At that time, we believed that the first Disease X could be a transmissible infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus originated from bats. This supposition was based on a live SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), designated SARSr-CoV-WIV1, isolated from bat fecal samples in Vero E6 cells. It had 99.9% whole genome sequence identity to that of SARSr-CoV-Rs3367 identified from Chinese horseshoe bats and another novel strain, SARSr-CoV-RsSHC014, both of which could utilize human, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the host cell receptor for infecting human, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat target cells (Ge et al. 2013; Cui et al. 2019). This evidence prompted us to accelerate our efforts to develop viral fusion inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies with broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against divergent human coronaviruses and SARSr-CoVs (Zeng et al.2017; Xia et al. 2019).",

However, no name for the pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV infection has been provided by WHO or by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) so far. Accordingly, some researchers decided to denote this novel coronavirus as \u201cnovel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP)\u201d in their publication (Li et al. 2020). However, in the generally accepted lexicon, one would then have to write \u201cnovel coronavirus-infected pneumonia coronavirus (NCIP-CoV)\u201d, which could be an awkward construct. Most reporters and media are still calling it \u201cWuhan pneumonia\u201d, but this terminology is detrimental to Wuhanese already facing lockdown and economic loss. The obvious dilemmas call for a renaming of the disease and virus causing the disease, one that is both lexicographically and taxonomically appropriate (news.ifeng.com/c/7tf2GFqwL4a).",

However, several experts in the coronavirus field have expressed their concern that the term PARS seems to exclude associated respiratory syndrome arising from other etiologies of pneumonia. Therefore, we herein propose the following alternative terminology: \u201ctransmissible acute respiratory syndrome (TARS)\u201d and \u201cTARS-CoV\u201d for the virus, similar to SARS-CoV, since 2019-nCoV is one of the most transmissible coronaviruses identified so far. Although the estimated R0 (~ 2.6) of 2019-nCoV (Zhao et al.2020) is generally in line with that of SARS (R0: 2\u20135), it is much higher than that of MERS (R0: < 1) (Chen et al.2020). In addition, the number of 2019-nCoV-infected patients via human-to-human transmission is at least 3- and 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected patients, respectively. On 5 February 2020, the New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (trial version 5) published by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China indicated that the routes of transmission via aerosols and digestive tract were also possible, even though 2019-nCoV is, thus far, known to be primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and contacts (m.chinanews.com/wap/detail/sp/sp/shipin/cns/2020/02-05/news9080314.shtml), rendering the virus even more transmissible or infectious. Please be aware that WHO may not take our suggestion and ICTV should make the final decision about renaming 2019-nCoV, as they did for naming MERS-CoV in 2013 (de Groot et al. 2013).",

EK1 peptide could protect hDPP4-transgenic mice or regular mice treated with EK1 via intranasal application before or after challenge with MERS-CoV or hCoV-OC43, respectively. Most recently, Jiang and colleagues showed that EK1 peptide and the peptide derived from the HR2 domain in spike (S) protein of 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV-HR2P) could effectively inhibit 2019-nCoV pseudovirus infection and S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion (Xia et al. 2020), indicating that either EK1 or 2019-nCoV-HR2P could be promising candidates to be developed for prevention and treatment of infection by 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and possibly other emerging and reemerging coronaviruses in the future.",

Interestingly, we have previously demonstrated that antibodies induced by SARS-CoV S-RBD could cross-neutralize infection by bat SARSr-CoVs, including bat-SARSr-CoV-W1V1 and bat-SARSr-CoV-SHC014 (Zeng et al.2017). Most recently, we have shown that one SARS-CoV S-RBD-specific monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could potently bind with 2019-nCoV S-RBD, using different probative assays (Tian et al.2020). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV S-RBD-based vaccine candidate should be tested for its in vitro and in vivo efficacy in inducing neutralizing antibody responses and protection of animals against 2019-nCoV infection. If it works, the already developed RBD-based anti-SARS vaccine candidate has sufficient potential to go to clinical studies for the prevention of 2019-nCoV infection.",
