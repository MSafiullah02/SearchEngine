Conjunctivitis is present in 3.175% of patients with COVID-19; however, only 0.703% of patients present with conjunctivitis as the first presenting feature [2-4] and 1.949% of patients demonstrate the virus in tear/conjunctival specimen [2] . These findings indicate ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is also a possibility of local replication of the virus followed by systemic involvement, especially in cases of droplet or aerosol transmission through the ocular route [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

In vitro studies demonstrate corneal and conjunctival expression of ACE2, thus suggesting a link between the ocular system and respiratory system in case of COVID-19 [13] . Another route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 to human host is through its interactions with CD147 [14] , which is present in tear and human ocular tissues, e.g., corneal epithelium, endothelium, keratocytes, conjunctiva, and retinal pigment epithelium [15] . Thus, the conjunctival route may play a major route in establishment of infection [5] .",

In rabbit model of adenoviral conjunctivitis, topical povidone iodine along with dexamethasone was found to be very effective [24] . In clinical settings, povidone iodine (5% and 1%) already showed clinical benefit in cases of adenoviral conjunctivitis [25] [26] [27] . Now, coming to the efficacy of povidone iodine treatment in SARS-CoV, treatment with povidone iodine for 2 min reduces viral infectivity to below detectable level and the efficiency of povidone iodine was similar to 70% ethanol in terms of reducing viral infectivity [28] . There are reports citing efficacy of povidone iodine gurgle/mouth wash against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [29, 30] , and on the basis of these findings, povidone iodine mouth wash/gurgle is being recommended in cases of SARS-CoV-2 also [31, 32] by various authors.",

Occurrence of resistance is not an issue with povidone iodine. So, here comes a theoretically potential role of using povidone iodine 1% locally (eye drop) in case of accidental ocular exposure or in case of 2019-nCoV-associated conjunctivitis. However, toxicity profile of povidone iodine is to be to be considered and we need more clinical data for further validation.",
