Device reports are typically not delivered in a form that can be easily processed per node, so we perform the equivalent of a parallel bucket sort [12] . Our previous work developing algorithms for computational cosmology demonstrated the utility of abstracting the most challenging aspect of a parallel algorithm into a sort [13] . We eliminate nodes that have fewer than 10 reports in a day. We also eliminate nodes that report over a short part of the day (less than 8 hours) to avoid biasing the mobility stastistic downward with transient reports. We calculate a number of statistics intended to capture the mobility of a population ( Figure 1 ). The max-distance mobility M max is the maximum Haversine (great circle) distance (in units of km) from the initial location report of the day. Outliers (which can occur with bad position reports caused by poor GPS fixes or other errors) are trimmed by eliminating the top 10% of the distribution. The bounding box mobility is computed by determining the area of the bounding box of the reports A bb , and then converting to an equivalent linear distance in km, M bb = 111 \u221a A bb cos(latitude). The convex hull mobility is computed by determining the area of the convex hull A ch of the reported positions, and then converting it to an equivalent linear distance in km via M ch = 111 \u221a A ch cos(latitude). For a canonical position of each processed node (such as the first or last report of the day in local time, or a derived location such as the centroid of node locations) we reverse geocode the location to a country and administrative region. We use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes for the country_code and GeoNames feature names and codes for subcategories. Admin1 is the first-order administrative division, being a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States. Admin2 is a second-order administrative division, such as a county or borough in the United States.

We also store the data in a comma-seperated values (CSV) format which may be more familiar to users of traditional geographic information systems or mapping tools. One significant caveat to the accuracy of the statistics we present here is related to systematic sampling errors. We assume that the sampling of devices is \"fair\" and represents the behavior of the population as a whole. Since data is available for only a small fraction of the total number of devices (a few percent at most), it is possible that those position reports that are selected for inclusion in the raw location data we use as input have a correlation with behavior that is not representative of the average. For instance, if the data vendor includes position reports from a transportation \"app\", we expect those reports to show considerably more distance traveled than an app that would be used while at home. As long as the data from both sets of apps is consistently included, the systematic sampling error would be expected to be small. However, if the data vendor loses access to one type of app, that would skew the mobility statistics, and not represent a change in actual behavior. Similar types of error would be expected if there was a correlation between changes in mobility, and the probability of appearing in the location dataset (e.g. if people who travel long distances are more likely to disable location reporting). We mitigate the effects of these sampling errors to the extent possible by analysis of multiple datasets, and we seek to validate the statistics through independent observations.",
