Resveratrol is a pharmacologically active compound that interacts with multiple targets in a variety of cardiovascular disease models to exert protective effects or induce a reduction in cardiovascular risk parameters (Tang et al., 2014). Endothelial hyperpermeability induced by hyperglycemia is the initial step in the development of atherosclerosis, one of the most serious cardiovascular complications in diabetes. Resveratrol ameliorates high-glucose-induced hyperpermeability mediated by caveolae via VEGF/KDR pathway (Tian et al., 2013). Polydatin, a resveratrol glucoside extracted from P. cuspidatum, attenuates cardiac hypertrophy through modulation of cardiac Ca2 + handling and calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway (Ding et al., 2014).",

Its antiproliferative effect might be associated with the downregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by the suppression of the Src-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, hence blocking cell cycle progression. TSG could prevent cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload in rats (Xu et al., 2014b), which may be related to a decreasing angiotensin II level, an antioxidant effect, suppression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 expression, and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Proteomic analysis was used to investigate the molecular events occurring in the atherosclerotic rats after TSG treatment (Yao et al., 2013). TSG treatment suppresses atherosclerosis by altering the expression of different proteins. Calreticulin, vimentin, HSP 70, lipocortin 1, and Apo A-I are key proteins that may be novel molecular targets responsible for atherogenesis suppression induced by TSG treatment.",

Genetic diversity, population structure, and colonization patterns in the invasive P. cespitosum, a highly selfing, tetraploid Asian annual introduced to North America, were examined using nine diploidized polymorphic microsatellite markers (SSR; Matesanz et al., 2014). Low heterozygosity was found in all 16 populations, consistent with the selfing mating system of P. cespitosum. Despite the high selfing levels, substantial genetic variation within and among P. cespitosum populations was revealed, based on the percentage of polymorphic loci, allelic richness, and expected heterozygosity. Inferences from individual assignment tests and pairwise FST values indicated high among-population differentiation, which indicates that the effects of gene flow are limited relative to those of genetic drift, probably due to the high selfing rates and the limited seed dispersal ability of P. cespitosum. Population structure appears to be the result of the random movement of propagules across the introduced range, possibly associated with human dispersal. The high population differentiation, genetic diversity, and fine-scale genetic structure (populations founded by individuals from different genetic sources) in the introduced range suggest that multiple introductions to this region may have occurred. High genetic diversity may further contribute to the invasive success of P. cespitosum in its introduced range.",

Age estimates for Polygonaceae were obtained by calibrating a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (Schuster et al., 2013), using a relaxed molecular clock with fossil data. Eighty-one species of Polygonaceae were analyzed with MrBayes to infer species relationships. One nuclear (nrITS) and three chloroplast (cp) markers (the trnL-F spacer region and matK and ndhF genes) were used. Seven calibration points including fossil pollen and a leaf fossil of Muehlenbeckia (a Southern Hemisphere group) were used to infer node ages. Results of the Beast analyses indicate an age of 110.9/118.7 million years (My) with an uncertainty interval of 90.7\u2013125.0 My for the stem age of Polygonaceae. This age is older than previously thought (approximately 65.5\u201370.6 My). The estimated divergence time for Muehlenbeckia is 41.0/41.6 (39.6\u201347.8) My and its crown clade is 20.5/22.3 (14.2\u201333.5) My.

Molecular phylogenetic studies using three cpDNA regions and nrITS sequences were performed to explore the hybrid speciation in Persicaria (Polygonum, Polygonaceae; Figure 12.4\n) (Kim and Donoghue, 2008), with an emphasis on sampling within section Eupersicaria. There are major conflicts between the combined cpDNA tree and the nrITS tree; a variety of incongruence tests rejected stochastic error as the cause of incongruence in most cases. Both the tree incongruence results and information on chromosome numbers suggest that the origin of 10 polyploid species involved interspecific hybridization.

Fifteen species seem to be allopolyploids, which is higher than the number found in previous comparisons of cp DNA and nrITS phylogenies (Kim and Donoghue, 2008). This underestimation of the extent of allopolyploidy is due in at least three cases to homogenization of nrITS toward the maternal lineage. The diploid species, P. lapathifolia, has been involved in at least six cases of allopolyploid speciation. Of the diploids, this species is the most widespread geographically and ecologically and also bears more numerous and conspicuous flowers, illustrating ecological factors that may influence hybridization frequency.

Trib. Polygoneae and trib. Rumiceae are recovered on both cp and ITS trees (Figure 12.4), while trib. Atraphaxideae is not. The placement of P. bistorta is uncertain due to conflict between cp and ITS trees (Figure 12.4). It was proposed that the genus Koenigia be circumscribed to include five species, that is, perennials (K. forrestii and K. nummularifolia) and annuals (K. islandica, K. pilosa, and K. nepalensis). However, on both cp and ITS trees, K. nepalensis (P. nepalense) is more closely related to P. capitatum and P. chinense (Figure 12.4), instead of Koenigia. K. islandica and K. fertilis (P. fertile, Figure 12.4a), both of which are from the Himalayan region, can be merged into a single species. P. delicatulum (K. delicatula), P. campanulatum, and P. lichiangense occupy an isolated position at the base of the Polygonaceae (Figure 12.4a), which might be reassigned to a new genus.",

It is not entirely clear that P. hydropiper served as the maternal parent, since the relationship between P. hydropiper and P. minor is weakly supported in the cpDNA tree (Figure 12.4b).
