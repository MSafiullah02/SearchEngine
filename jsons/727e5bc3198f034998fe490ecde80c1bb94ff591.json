Alone the increasing infected numbers, the death rates (death person versus confirmed cases within selected area) seem to be less than 3% but much higher in new burst out countries. Most of the aged people are in dangerous status especially the one also has served medical history. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may be found, but not all, in infected patients include fever (Infrared thermo-sensor can be used to detect high temperature persons), coughing, myalgia, fatigue, some with productive cough, headache, hemoptysis, and even diarrhea. Some patients will have severe pneumonia with difficulty in respiration (18% calculated from record in China). 1 More recently, some patients were found to be with a disability to distinguish smell and/or tests (neurological disorder).

The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients. One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets. Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV or not is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome. The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the manpower almost in every country. Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed. In this review article, we sort out some state-of-the-art novel approaches that might be applied for a fast, sensitive, and precise detection of SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV not only to help the routine laboratory testing but also to improve effective quarantine.",

Since no one knows who has already been infected and becomes infectious to others, they are at the same time freely to go out for their daily activities which, unfortunately, easily causes COVID-19 transmission. This situation causes a serious problem during the establishment of prevention network in every country. In Taiwan, to avoid the false-negative case, it requires at least three sequential negative tests of the SARS-CoV-2 before the case can be confirmed negative (combined with the positive or negative result to influenza virus). According to the Taiwan model, to quarantine any suspicious individuals for a period time according to the activities and contact history of the confirmed cases can efficiently slow down the transmission of COVID-19. However, it could profoundly disturb the daily life of a large population if related cases are confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. In general, for personal epidemic prevention of COVID-19, avoiding contact from hands, nose, and eyes and droplets is the primary task. How to foresee the SARS-CoV-2 infected targets and to just isolate selected population for advanced treatments while keeping others healthy (and free from quarantine) is one of the important goals during this global war against SARS-CoV-2.",

According to the current data, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has similar infection route to the SARS-CoV. [2] [3] [4] Both viruses utilize the surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which expresses in certain types of human cells such as type 2 alveolar cells, as a receptor for its spike protein to attach to the host cells. 3 The entry of the attached virus requires endocytosis through priming the S protein by host TMPRSS2 serine protease, 4 and is regulated by the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). Disruption of AAK1 might interrupt the entry of the virus into host cells and the intracellular assembly of virus particles. 5 The structures of several SARS-CoV related proteins, including the spike proteins, main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and ACE2, [6] [7] [8] have been resolved to provide valuable information for the following development of new detection sensors or even the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",

In Taiwan, such method is relatively mature since the breakout of SARS in 2003. However, it still takes around 4 hours to get the results, including 2 to 3 hours of reaction and around 1 hour of medical consultations and sampling. Moreover, to carefully confirm the infection, three regions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences are selected for the assay: coding region for spike protein, ORF1, and ORF8. To shorten the reaction time, some company tried to develop new instruments and related kits for this purpose, for example, the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test (Cepheid), and AutoSAT with related kit, etc. These improvements may shorten the examination reaction within 1.5 hours.",

Since this method is not a direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there could exist blind spot when the samples are found to be negative.

A specific exonuclease II (recognizing THF site) will be utilized to cut the double-strand status due to targeted RNA sensed the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (such exo FRET probe is designed to be located within the targeted amplicon). Once this cut happens, it allows the restore of the FAM fluorescence since the quencher BHQ1 leaves. The authors claim that the sensing limit of this ultrasensitive detection method can be as low as 0.32 aM (0.32 \u00d7 10 -18 M) of RNA. 13 ",

However, the increased susceptive populations nearly exhaust the routine test Special Invitation. (2020) XXX:XXX J Chin Med Assoc procedure in many countries. Indeed, some of the new emerged approaches has potential for the future rapid diagnostics to release the heavy loading of rRT-PCR test, if their specificity and efficacy can be proved through clinical trial. For example, the antibody-based test developed by Academia Sinica has a great potential for fast exam since it can be adapted in the commercial flu-like test. The challenge will be the amplification of mAb, which is the rate-limit stage for large production of this kit. On the other hand, another novel method combining a modified RNA amplification technique with FRET quenching concept provide convincing results for future usage. Finally, in addition to the above example, the FRET-based strategy can also be applied to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 receptor, or the activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease using specific peptide sequence as substrate between the FRET pair fluorescent proteins.",
