            "text": "Akabane virus (AKAV) is transmitted by arthropod vectors such as Culicoides oxystoma (Kurogi et al., 1987) and it is the etiological agent that causes Akabane disease. AKAV causes abortions, stillbirths, and congenital disorders in cows, goats, and sheep (Kurogi et al., 1987). AKAV has been detected in Japan, Korea, China, Israel, Australia, Turkey, Sudan, and Kenya (Kurogi et al., 1975, Lee et al., 2002, Jun et al., 2012, Stram et al., 2004, Della-Porta et al., 1976, Taylor and Mellor, 1994, Elhassan et al., 2014, Davies and Jessett, 1985). AKAV belongs to the Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus in the family Bunyaviridae. In addition to AKAV, the Simbu serogroup includes Aino virus, Peaton virus, and Shamonda virus. Recently, a novel Orthobunyavirus called Schmallenberg virus emerged in Europe, which is associated with reduced milk production and diarrhea in adult cattle, as well as congenital malformations in cows and sheep (Garigliany et al., 2012, van den Brom et al., 2012). The AKAV genome comprises three segments of negative sense single-stranded RNA: large (L), medium (M), and small (S). The L segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the M segment encodes the precursor of glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a nonstructural protein (NSm), and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N) and a nonstructural protein (NSs). The nonstructural proteins are assumed to interact with the vector/host immune system, thereby contributing to viral pathogenesis (Eifan et al., 2013, Bridgen et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are intracellular signal transduction pathways that respond to various extracellular stimuli, which are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process, including growth, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis (Strniskov\u00e1 et al., 2002). The three major MAPK cascades are the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase cascade, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, and the p38 MAPK cascade. JNK is a regulator of the transcription factor c-Jun and a mediator of intra or extracellular stresses such as heat shock, osmotic shock, cytokines, and UV, which is also known as the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascade (Robinson and Cobb, 1997). The p38 MAPK cascade is another SAPK signaling pathway; however, there is considerable cross-talk as well as shared components with the JNK cascade (Plotnikov et al., 2011). The activated JNK translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates and transactivates c-Jun, and the phosphorylated c-Jun then leads to the formation of activator protein 1 (AP-1). The formation of AP-1 is related to the transcription of a wide variety of proteins, including proapoptotic factors (Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008). p38 MAPK is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), activating transcription factor 1, and cAMP response element-binding protein (Dorion and Landry, 2002, Cowan, 2003).",

            "text": "In general, activation of the JNK cascade and p38 MAPK cascade induces apoptosis. These two activated cascades mediate intracellular signaling and lead to caspase-3 activation, which is indispensable for apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Caspase-3 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme, which is activated via cleavage at specific Asp residues to yield the active enzyme that contains large (p20) and small (p10) subunits (Cohen, 1997, Cho and Choi, 2002). JNK activation is the mediator of apoptosis induction by some viruses such as infectious bursal disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and equine influenza virus (Wei et al., 2011, Yin et al., 2012, Lin et al., 2001). Furthermore, some viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 and rotavirus can manipulate the JNK signaling pathway to regulate viral replication (McLean and Bachenheimer, 1999, Holloway and Coulson, 2006). The p38 MAPK signaling pathway is activated to induce apoptosis by bluetongue virus, soft-shelled turtle iridovirus, and other viruses as well as to control viral replication by viruses such as coxsackievirus B3 and varicella-zoster virus (Mortola and Larsen, 2010, Huang et al., 2011, Si et al., 2005, Rahaus et al., 2004). In case of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, p38 MAPK induces cell death in Vero E6 cells and JNK is related to persistent infection (Mizutani et al., 2004, Mizutani et al., 2005). Viruses in the Simbu serogroup replicate and induce apoptosis in cultured cells (Lim et al., 2005, Barry et al., 2014, Varela et al., 2013).",

As shown in Fig. 4C, the inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway by the addition of SP600125 led to marked inhibition of caspase-3 compared with that of untreated cells. In contrast, the amount of cleaved caspase-3 did not differ between control cells and those treated with SB203580 (Fig. 4C). The copy numbers of AKAV RNA in the AKAV-infected cells treated with the two inhibitors were almost the same as those in untreated AKAV-infected cells according to real-time PCR at 48 hpi (data not shown).

In this study, we investigated whether AKAV infection induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation and found that both signaling pathways were activated persistently by AKAV infection. In MAPK cascades, activation of the JNK cascade and the p38 MAPK cascade tend to promote apoptosis, and several studies have demonstrated that virus-mediated activation of these two cascades leads to apoptosis (Franklin and McCubrey, 2000, Wang et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2009). Our data clearly showed that JNK inhibition by treatment with each specific inhibitor resulted in marked suppression of AKAV-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK did not. Thus, the JNK cascade plays a crucial role in apoptosis caused by AKAV. Oropouche virus is a member of the Simbu serogroup and a cause of acute febrile illness in humans. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and activation of caspase-9 and -3 are detected during viral infection, and Oropouche virus infection causes apoptosis via an intracellular pathway that involves mitochondria (Acrani et al., 2010). JNK promotes the translocation of the Bcl-2 family pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, into mitochondria via the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins that cause dissociation of Bax, where this translocation is essential for mediating the apoptotic release of cytochrome C (Tsuruta et al., 2004, Papadakis et al., 2006). Thus, we suggest that AKAV-induced JNK activation exerts a pro-apoptotic effect via the mitochondrial pathway, thereby regulating Bax translocation into the mitochondria, cytochrome C release, and caspase activation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results indicate that AKAV infection induces the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK as well as their downstream substrates, c-Jun and HSP27 in cultured cells. In particular, JNK activation plays a crucial role in AKAV-induced apoptosis. AKAV causes abortions, stillbirths, and congenital disorders in animals. This study is useful to understand the pathogenicity of AKAV.",
