Due to a previous lack of in-depth research on the characteristics of the disease, the mortality of severe illness is high(4). It is very important to analyse the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in international regions and identify risk factors to reduce the incidence of severe and critical illness in the early stage.

The mean age was 49.03 years in severe patients and 40.83 years in non-severe patients, with a significant difference (p=0.007). There were 95 males (56.89%) and 72 females (43.11%); however, there was no significant differences in sex between the two groups. Among 167 patients, 146 had fever (87.43%), 132 had cough (79.04%) and 61 had shortness of breath (36.53%). The prevalence of shortness of breath was 73.33% in severe patients, which was significantly greater than the 28.47% prevalence in non-severe patients (p<0.001). There were 44 patients (26.35%) with comorbidities, of which 9 had multiple comorbidities (5.39%). Among patients with diabetes, severe cases were significantly more common than in non-severe patients (p<0.001). Compared to non-severe patients, fingertip oxygen saturation decreased significantly in severe patients (p<0.001), which predisposed patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to acute exacerbation. Since SARS-CoV-2 affected multiple organs by binding angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor(6) and many severe COVID-19 patients had comorbidities, multidisciplinary team (MDT) consultation played an important role in reducing the mortality of severe infection.
