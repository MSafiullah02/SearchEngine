            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first emerging infectious disease in the 21st century with a fatality rate of ca. 8% and is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) [1]. The nucleocapsid protein is a key component of the virus and is essential for virus formation. It binds to the viral RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein core, which can enter the host cell and interact with cellular processes [2], [3], [4], [5]. The free protein presumably exists as a dimer in solution, with the dimerization domain located at the C-terminus [6], [7]. We have previously defined the structural domains of the SARS-CoV N protein [8]. The C-terminal structural domain coincides with the dimerization domain identified in previous studies, and our biochemical studies showed that it exists as a dimer in solution. Denaturation studies have shown that dissociation of the SARS-CoV N protein is coupled with loss of structure, implying a structure-dependent mechanism for self-association [9]. Understanding this mechanism would not only provide insights into the viral assembly process, but also identify additional targets for drugs to combat SARS through disruption of N protein self-association. However, there has been no 3D structure of the dimerization domain of coronavirus N protein published and the underlining principle governing the self-association of coronavirus N protein dimer is also unknown. We have employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to investigate the structure of the dimerization domain of SARS-CoV N protein. We report our results in this communication.",

Isotopically labeled protein samples were prepared by culturing the cells in standard M9 media, supplemented with 15NH4Cl (1 g/L) (For 15N-labeling) and/or u-13C-glucose (2 g/L) (For 13C-labeling) and appropriately labeled Isogro (0.5 g/L) (Isotec, OH, USA). Perdeuterated isotopically labeled protein samples were prepared by culturing the cells in the same media in D2O (80% D2O for samples used in filtered experiments) and supplemented with deuterated Isogro and glucose. Deuteration rates for all clones were on the order of 85% (65% for samples used in filtered experiments) as measured by mass spectrometry. The cells were broken with a microfluidizer and the protein purified through a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, CA, USA) in buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, and pH 7.4) containing 7 M urea. The protein was then allowed to refold by dialysis in liquid chromatography buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, and pH 7.4). Renatured protein was loaded onto an AKTA-EXPLORER fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) system equipped with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany) was added to the purified protein. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit as per instructions from the manufacturer (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The correct molecular weight of the expressed protein was then confirmed by mass spectroscopy.",

All NMR data were acquired at 30 \u00b0C on 500, 600 or 800 MHz Bruker AVANCE spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance TXI cryoprobe with an actively-shielded Z-gradient. Experimental parameters were set as described previously [11], [12]. Sequential backbone resonance assignments for 1HN, 15N, 13C\u03b1 and 13C\u03b2 were derived from standard 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments [13]. (Hm)CmCH-TOCSY experiments were also obtained to correct for isotope effect on 13C chemical shifts [14]. The assignments of H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 resonances were achieved from analysis of the HBHA(CO)NH spectrum. H(CC)(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH and HCCH-TOCSY spectra were analyzed to obtain side chain assignments. To identify the interface region involved in dimer interactions, F1[13C, \n15N]-filtered, F3-15N-edited and F1[13C, \n15N]-filtered, F3-13C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra were obtained using a (u-2H,13C,15N)NP248\u2013365(65% deuteration)/NP248\u2013365 hetero-dimer sample prepared by mixing labeled NP248\u2013365 sample with equal amount of unlabeled NP248\u2013365 sample [15], [16]. The protein was denatured in 8 M urea and renatured by extensive dialysis in desired NMR buffer conditions. Data were processed with the XWINNMR suite and AURELIA software (Bruker, Germany) on SGI workstations or NMRPipe on Linux workstations [17]. The 1H chemical shift was referenced to DSS at 0 ppm as suggested [18].",

NP248\u2013365 is the most stable domain which retains the dimer structure. Shortening the fragment causes structural changes and lengthening the fragment has no effect on the structure of NP248\u2013365. Backbone assignment for most amino acids of NP248\u2013365 was achieved except for residues located at the N-terminus and H301 (Fig. 1\nA). Perdeuteration of NP248\u2013365 was necessary to obtain triple-resonance spectra due to short T2 (transverse relaxation time) of the dimer. The secondary structure of NP248\u2013365 was determined from standard NMR parameters, such as the characteristic NOE patterns, the consensus chemical shift indices (CSI), the magnitude of the 3\nJ\nHN\u03b1 value, and the HN exchange rates (Fig. 1B).

            "text": "The short T2 of the NP248\u2013365dimer (MW = 28 kD) precluded full assignment of side chain resonances due to weak signals even on cryoprobe-equipped spectrometers, thus hampered complete 3D structure determination of the dimer to high resolution. However, most H\u03b1, H\u03b2 and aliphatic side-chain nuclei could be assigned from (Hm)CmCH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Further analysis of the intramolecular dimer-interface NOEs identified a number of contacts between the two \u03b2 strands, which allowed us to define the \u03b2 hairpin structure (Fig. 2\nA). This information allowed us to manually assign the intermolecular NOEs at the dimer interface from analysis of the F1[13C, \n15N]-filtered, F3-15N-edited and F1[13C, \n15N]-filtered, F3-13C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra using u-(2H,13C,15N)NP248\u2013365(65% deuteration)/unlabeled-NP248\u2013365 sample. Our results indicate that the dimer interface is composed of a continuous four-stranded \u03b2-sheet, formed by extensive hydrogen bond interactions between the two long \u03b2 strands of the two \u03b2-hairpins, contributed one from each of the two monomers (Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n). The dimer is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between residues on one side of the amphipathic long helix E and the \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 3B). The presence of the extensive interactions between the two monomers in a dimer provides strong stabilization force and explains why the two monomers cannot be separated without denaturing the protein, even though there is no cysteine in the dimerization domain to form a covalent disulfide bond. This arrangement is reminiscent of the dimer-interface of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid protein (Fig. 3C) [19], the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 (Fig. 3D) [19] and the peptide recognition domain of the human histocompatibility antigen (HLA) [20], [21].",

However, we show that there are common principles that underlie the architecture of a nucleocapsid protein in both SARS-CoV and PRRSV. They both contain two regions, one for RNA-binding and the other for dimerization or oligomerization [8], [23], albeit the two domains in SARS-CoV N protein is linked by a much longer flexible linker of \u223c120 a.a. Most importantly, the structures of the dimer interface of the two viruses are very similar. The presence of extensive interactions in the dimer interface may render this dimer interface to become self-contained, i.e., it is less likely to be dependent on the global structure of the protein. In fact, we have found that a.a. NP281\u2013365 still retained dimerization potential, even though structural differences were evident from NMR spectra (Fig. 4\n). Similar observations have been reported in the literature [6]. It is evident that the tight dimer interface structure permits certain extended perturbation in the global structure without affecting the dimer structure. Such characteristics make this particular fold ideal as a common building block for dimer interfaces in a variety of proteins.",

Sequence alignment coupled with secondary structure prediction show that many share the \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 topology observed in SARS-CoV (Fig. 5\n). In particular, the long \u03b2-strand and the long C-terminal helix are predicted to be present in all cases. Most of them also contain the short \u03b2-strand, with the exceptions of BCoV, HCoV and PHEV. These results raise the possibility that all coronavirus employ the same interface mechanism for dimerization and they belong to the same structural class, however this cannot be verified by the class-dependent prediction algorithm because of the lack of known tertiary structure [26].",
