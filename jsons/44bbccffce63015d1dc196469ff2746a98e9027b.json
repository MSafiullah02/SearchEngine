Why do we seem to be so powerless in the face of such a microscopic entity and how can we prevent another catastrophe following the same path in years to come?",

We have platform technologies for vaccine production where a key gene of the novel virus could be slotted into a genetic cassette to replace the equivalent gene in a virus backbone already known to be safe and effective for the prevention of similar infections. The problem is that the time taken is too long to be able to affect a current pandemic caused by a virus with a short incubation period. This is illustrated well by a report on the outcome of committing tremendous resources to make a vaccine against pandemic influenza that appeared in the spring of 2009. 2 A vaccine was prepared, but only arrived just after the peak of the first wave of cases. The major delays were in producing reagents required for gaining conventional regulatory approval, followed by vaccine manufacturing capacity and bottling and labelling capacity. 2 It should also be noted that the regulatory path for influenza vaccine is already shorter than for others, because it is based on assessing variation of a process that is already licensed for production of seasonal influenza vaccines.",

We would need to have drugs that can inhibit several members of a virus family with the hope that the novel strain that emerges will retain susceptibility to this drug. Thus, targeting inhibition of a key enzyme needed for replication, such as the polymerase, would be a good starting point. We have the ability to design such chemicals, produce them in pharmaceutically acceptable forms, conduct clinical trials to show their safety and efficacy (using volunteers challenged with respiratory viruses if necessary) and to produce sufficient quantities to act as a stockpile in case infection arrives in the future. 3 However, we choose not to do this because of the economic cost.",

We should not be thinking of making a product and measuring its success by serial plots of drug sales displayed proudly on the wall of the office of the chief financial officer of the responsible company. Instead, we should focus on the value that the stockpile of drug has for the world community in terms of the reassurance it provides against the death and disruption that would otherwise be caused by a novel virus. For example, if such a stockpile had been made against SARS virus after 2003, it would have been ready to protect us against death from SARS-CoV-2. The money saved from preventing the current pandemic would have paid many times over for the cost of developing such a drug and stockpiling it. Those who make decisions at the international level should therefore be encouraged to think of the cost in terms of paying an insurance premium to provide reassurance against a future adverse event. We also need to anticipate and forestall adverse criticisms from the general press who are likely to complain about the cost of buying and storing a quantity of drug that may never be used; much as they did when oseltamivir stocks were procured following the 2009 influenza pandemic. We need to remind them that citizens do not complain when they reach the end of the year to find that they have not had to claim on an insurance policy; no one explained why we need to act to protect ourselves against the inevita-Their vision was correct but, tragically for many, the next plague came too soon.",
