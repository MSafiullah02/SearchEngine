Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit 36 protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly 37 advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein 38 in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation 39 of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following 40 mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses 41 against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising 42 activity and capacity to block ACE2/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-43 specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected 44 within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) 45 constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma 46 neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but 47 notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets. Thus both 48 qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immunity to spike constitute 49 informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. 50 51 52 All rights reserved.

In contrast to 56 historical pandemics, such as the 1918 \"Spanish\" H1N1 influenza, modern 57 recombinant technology enables a rapid scientific response, with multiple vaccines 58 under development, almost exclusively aimed at eliciting antibodies to the viral 59 \"spike\" protein. The spike (S) protein of beta-coronaviruses is expressed as a single protein, with 62 proteolytic cleavage yielding S1 and S2 subunits 1 . S localises on the virion surface 63 and mediates both recognition of cellular receptors and membrane fusion. In the case 64 of SARS-CoV-2, a receptor binding domain (RBD) within S1 directly interacts with 65 high affinity with the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 66 2-4 . The S2 subunit of S mediates membrane fusion. The S/ACE2 interaction mediates 67 viral entry and provides an attractive target for vaccine-elicited humoral immunity 5 , 68 with antibodies potentially capable of either (i) directly blocking binding of ACE2 by 69 S, (ii) blocking conformational changes in S critical for membrane fusion, (iii) 70 eliminating infected cells through antibody effector mechanisms such as antibody-71 dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or (iv) driving accelerated clearance of free 72 virus. 73",

For example CR3022 which binds a cryptic epitope on the RBD 6,7 , 77 while S309, derived from the memory B cells of a SARS-CoV recovered subject, 78 blocks ACE2 engagement by SARS-CoV-2 S 8 . A recent report of monoclonal 79 antibodies recovered from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors revealed multiple non-80 overlapping epitopes on the RBD, with different capacities for mediating 81 neutralisation 9 . Few neutralising epitopes localised outside the RBD have been 82 characterised to date, with preliminary reports of neutralising epitopes within the N- immunogens in humans are poorly resolved. Here we undertook an in-depth 94 characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against spike in humans who 95 recovered from mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find antibody responses 96 to both S and the RBD are consistently elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 97 magnitude of which correlates with both plasma neutralising activity and inhibition of 98 RBD/ACE2 binding. S-specific B cells comprise a significant proportion of the 99 circulating memory B cell pool following infection, with RBD-specific B cells 100 constituting a minor subpopulation in most subjects. Assessment of the circulating T 101 follicular helper (cTFH) population reveals that S-specific cTFH cells are also readily 102 detected in convalescent subjects, while T cell responses toward the RBD are 103 All rights reserved.

            "text": "Serological responses to spike antigens following SARS-CoV-2 infection 110 We recruited a cross-sectional cohort (N=41) of Australian adults recovered from 111 mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection and isolated plasma and PBMC samples at a 112 median of 32 (IQR: 28-35) days post-positive PCR test. The cohort had a median age 113 of 59 (IQR: 54-65) and was 43% female (17 of 41). Subjects reported mild to 114 moderate upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms with only 5 (12%) requiring 115 hospitalisation, and none requiring mechanical ventilation (Table S1) . A control 116 cohort of 27 healthy adults was recruited prior to widespread infection in Australia 117 (Table S2) . As we had an interest in the degree to which baseline cross-reactive 118 coronavirus immunity affected SARS-CoV-2 responses, we pre-screened the 27 119 uninfected subjects for serological reactivity against the beta coronavirus HCoV-120 HKU1 (HKU1) ( Figure S1 ), selecting individuals with the 5 highest and 5 lowest 121 plasma titres as controls for the study. 122 123 Serological profiles are presented stratified across the cohort based on neutralisation 124 activity for each subject. Antibodies binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike ( Figure 1A ) or 125 the RBD ( Figure 1B) were consistently observed in all 41 infected individuals by 126 ELISA, with minimal reactivity in the controls. Titres of S-and RBD-specific 127 antibody were highly correlated ( Figure S2 ). Consistent with previous reports 18 , low-128 level antibody responses cross-recognising the SARS-CoV RBD were observed in 129 most of our SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort ( Figure 1C ). Antibody responses to the 130 human coronavirus strain HKU were prevalent at moderate to high levels across the 131 cohort, in line with previous reports of widespread seropositivity to S proteins of 132 human coronaviruses in adults 19,20 ( Figure 1D ). The capacity of immune plasma to 133 block interaction between recombinant ACE2 and RBD was assessed by ELISA, with 134 modest levels of inhibition detected in most subjects, and selected subjects exhibiting 135 potent inhibitory activity ( Figure 1E ). Virus neutralising activity in the plasma was 136 similarly assessed using a microneutralisation assay with live SARS-CoV-2 infection 137 of Vero cells as previously described for 22 . 138 Neutralising antibody titres ranged from 40 to 508 (IQR:113-254) ( Figure 1F ). In 139 summary, antibody responses against both S and the RBD are consistently elicited in 140 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, the endpoints titres of which correlate significantly 141 with neutralising activity (r=0.55 and r=0.61 respectively) and ACE2 binding 142 inhibition (r=0.72 and r=0.72 respectively) in the plasma ( Figure S2) . 143 144 B cell responses to S antigens following SARS-CoV-2 infection 145 We next examined the frequency and specificity of class-switched B cells in 146 convalescent subjects using SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD proteins as flow cytometric 147 probes. Clear antigen-specific populations of CD19 + IgD -B cells (gating in Figure S3 ) 148 binding spike, spike and RBD or RBD alone could be resolved in our cohort of 149 recovered from SARS-CoV-2 subjects, with minimal background staining in 150 uninfected controls (Figure 2A ; Figure S4 ). Frequencies of spike + RBD -, spike + RBD + 151 and spike -RBD + B cells as a proportion of the CD19 + IgDpopulation were a median 152 0.38% (IQR 0.24-0.52), 0.047% (IQR 0.023-0.084) and 0.033% (IQR 0.015-0.045), 153 All rights reserved.
