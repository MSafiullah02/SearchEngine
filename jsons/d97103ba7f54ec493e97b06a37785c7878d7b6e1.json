The authors noted that there were only three randomized studies comparing NIV with invasive ventilation and that they had different endpoints and results [ 2 ] . A year later, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) published guidelines on the use of NIV in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). They did not consider the treatment of ALI due to respiratory infection. Conversely, at this time severe hypoxemia was regarded as a contraindication for NIV [ 4 ] . Certainly, there was no link to high-risk infection at that time. The Canadian Critical Care Trials group made no recommendations about the use of NIV in ARDS patients or those with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in 2011 [ 5 ] . In summary, compared to NIV for exacerbated COPD (hypercapnic respiratory failure), cardiogenic lung edema, or postextubation failure, the data regarding the use of NIV in patients with hypoxemic ARF are less clear [ 1 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 330, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 629, "end": 634, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 869, "end": 874, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1097, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Guidelines and Protocol for NIV in the Acute Care Setting"}, {"text": "Tables 40.1 and 40.2 summarize common accepted indications and contraindications for NIV.

Selection of the optimal interface-which connects the ventilator to the nose, mouth, or both-is an essential part of NIV. Air leakage, discomfort, or claustrophobia might result in patient intolerance. In the acute care setting, nasal, oronasal, or full-face masks are primarily used [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] . There are few randomized controlled trials comparing the use of an oronasal mask with a nasal mask.

As patients with ARF are often agitated and have pronounced respiratory drive, ventilation triggered by the patient's own respiratory efforts is benefi cial compared to controlled, timebased ventilation. When there is not suffi cient spontaneous inspiratory effort or it is inadequate to trigger the ventilator, pressure-controlled ventilation could be used [ 1 , 2 ] . Other guidelines do not emphasize a mode of ventilation on the strength of insuffi cient evidence [ 5 ] . Similar to invasive ventilation, ventilator settings should be adjusted to provide the lowest inspiratory pressures or volumes needed to improve oxygenation and patient comfort, which can be estimated by the decrease in the respiratory rate and respiratory muscle unloading [ 2 ] .

Therefore, organizations such as the World Health Organization [ 14 ] and the UK National Health Services Agency [ 15 ] published guidelines that treat NIV as a high-risk procedure.
