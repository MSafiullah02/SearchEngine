IBV is an economically important disease in the poultry industry, and several vaccines have been used to prevent the spread of IBV. IBV shows extensive antigenic variation, reflecting mutation of the spike protein gene (Cavanagh et al., 1988, Cavanagh et al., 1997, Wang and Huang, 2000). Vaccines targeting individual IBV serotypes yield poor cross-protection; therefore, various attenuated and inactivated multivalent vaccines (derived from several different serotypes) are used (Deguchi et al., 1998, Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011\n",

            "text": "The spike protein (S) is an envelope glycoprotein that forms a dimer or trimer, and has been shown to play an important role in viral infection (Cavanagh et al., 1986, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994, Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). S is highly glycosylated, and based on its amino acid sequence, the spike protein is predicted to contain 21 to 35 N-glycosylation sites. S has two main functions: to attach the virus to the host cell receptor, and to activate fusion of the virion membrane with the host cell membrane (Casais et al., 2003, Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). The S protein is the most important antigen in inducing neutralizing antibodies against IBV, and the N-terminal S1 region is especially important (Cavanagh et al., 1986, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994, Kant et al., 1992, Koch et al., 1990, Promkuntod et al., 2014). The S1 domain forms the bulbous head of the spike protein, and several virus neutralization (VN) epitopes have been reported to reside within the first and third quarter of the S1 sequence (Cavanagh et al., 1988, Kant et al., 1992, Koch et al., 1990, Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011). Thus, analysis of the antigenicity of the S1 domain is expected to be critical to the development of effective anti-IBV vaccines.",

Immunization with recombinant S1 protein expressed from baculovirus has been shown to provide in chicken effective protection against IBV infection (Song et al., 1998). Other groups also have reported that immunization with recombinant S1 epitope peptide expressed from Escherichia coli (E. coli) protected chickens against IBV infection (Yang et al., 2009a, Yang et al., 2009b). Furthermore, viral vectored vaccines co-expressing the S1 protein and host cytokines have been reported to induce anti-S1 antibodies (Chen et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2011, Tomley et al., 1987, Wang et al., 2009, Zeshan et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2012). However, in these reports of protection, recombinant antigen did not provide perfect protection and antibody titers were evaluated only by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the respective authors did not indicate whether these antigens retained their native neutralizing antigenicity (Song et al., 1998, Yang et al., 2009a, Yang et al., 2009b). Therefore, it remains unknown whether recombinant S1 protein, without the S2 domain, completely retains its conformational epitopes and neutralizing antigenicity.",

The primer set used for RT-PCR was 5\u2032-CAAATTATTGGTCAGAGATGTTGG-3\u2032 (S1.1) and 5\u2032-GAATCATTAAACAGACTTTTTAGGTCT-3\u2032 (S2R1).

Furthermore, DNA sequences encoding a 6\u00d7 His-tag peptide sequence, with or without those encoding a T4 phage fibritin coiled-coil trimerization motif (GSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFLG), were inserted in-phase and downstream of the recombinant S1-encoding gene.

The ELISA using recombinant S1 used sera that already had been adsorbed with His-tag peptides, precluding a role for the purification (His-tag) domain in the induced antibody response. In the ELISA using native S1, the native protein may have contained non-cleaved spike protein, thus including both S1 and S2 domains as part of the antigen. However, we found (data not shown) that inclusion (\u201cspiking\u201d) of S2 protein did not affect the results of the native S1 ELISA. This observation is consistent with other reports suggesting that the S2 region contains fewer neutralizing epitopes than does the S1 region; the literature indicates that most epitopes are located in the S1 region (Cavanagh et al., 1986, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994, Kant et al., 1992, Koch et al., 1990, Promkuntod et al., 2014). These results excluded the possibility that the other viral components affect the titer in ELISA. Thus, although recombinant S1 protein induced antibodies, this recombinant protein was decreased the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the recombinant S1 expressed in mammalian cells may change its character. In a separate test, we observed that antigen from inactivated virus that was denatured by boiling (5 min, 95 \u00b0C) did not induce neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). This result suggested that the correct conformation is important for S1 protein to induce neutralizing antibodies.",

In contrast, recombinant S1 protein expressed in 293 GnTI\u2212 cells (which lack N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase I activity and so do not generate complex N-glycans) ran as a sharper band of a size similar to that of native S1 protein. Together, these data indicated that the glycosylation pattern of recombinant S1 protein might differ from that of native S1, and that this difference reflects the level and nature of N-glycosyl modifications. We hypothesize that the native spike protein is typically decorated with high-mannose or hybrid-type N-glycans, and/or that the complex-type glycans decorating the native spike proteins are few in number and are homogeneous. It is known that glycosylation characteristics differ between species, and glycosylation affects the conformation of glycoproteins (Helenius, 1994). Therefore, glycosylation pattern differences may affect the conformation and antigenicity of the S1 protein. Furthermore, glycans attached on the surface of the envelope protein are known to mask antigenic sites, thereby permitting evasion of the host immune system (Sun et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2015). We infer that recombinant S1 protein antigenic sites also may be masked by glycans. From these hypotheses, there is the possibility that S1 expressed in other expression systems, which have different glycosylation character, also changes its antigenicity.",

            "text": "Other reports suggest that the S2 region of the IBV spike protein is important for the correct conformation of S (Callison et al., 1999, Promkuntod et al., 2013). Therefore, the recombinant S1 protein secreted in this study might assume a non-native conformation. We hypothesize that expression of the S1 domain without the S2 region results in the assumption of an unnatural conformation, resulting in unnatural glycosylation patterns, or that unnatural glycosylation of S1 protein causes the recombinant peptide to assume an unnatural conformation. Recombinant S1 protein may expose hidden epitope(s) that are normally latent in the protein. However, some researchers have reported that secreted recombinant S1 protein, when expressed fused to the trimerization motif peptide, binds the cell receptors (Promkuntod et al., 2013, Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). These reports suggested that the secreted S1 protein retains receptor binding ability. In addition, expression of other viral envelope proteins (specifically, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 and influenza virus hemaglutinin (HA)) as secreted proteins have been reported to induce neutralizing antibodies (Pancera et al., 2005, Wei et al., 2008). These reports indicated that secreting envelope proteins with a trimerization motif is an effective method for creating vaccine antigens. Additionally, Cavanagh (2007) reported that IBV S1 protein was sufficient for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (thought S1 was not sufficient for protection against IBV infection). Furthermore, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity induced by immunization of nucleocapsid protein (NP) has been shown to be important for virus clearance (Collisson et al., 2000, Seo and Collisson, 1997). However, in the present study, while immunization with recombinant IBV S1 (expressed as a secreted protein fused to the fibritin motif) induced antibodies, the response mainly consisted of non-neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, recombinant S1 protein (expressed as a secreted protein in mammalian cells) may be insufficient for use as a vaccine antigen. Recently, virus-like particle (VLP) -based antigens have been tested as new candidates for subunit vaccines against IBV (Cavanagh, 2003, Lv et al., 2014). Receptor binding domain (RBD) peptides also have been tested as vaccine candidates against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2012). These alternative approaches to antigen production may overcome the challenges observed in the present work.",
