Importantly, the method accounts for time delays between illness onset and case notification. Incorporation of this lag is critical for accurate interpretation of the most recent data in the analysis, to be sure that an observed drop in the number of reported cases reflects an actual drop in case numbers.",

Imported and locally acquired cases were assumed to be equally infectious. The method for estimating R eff is sensitive to this assumption. Hence, we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of stepwise reductions in the infectiousness of imported cases on R eff as a result of quarantine measures implemented over time (see Figures S2, S3, and S4 ). The sensitivity analyses suggest that R eff may well have dropped below 1 later than shown in Figure 2 .",

Note that further border measures were implemented during this period, including enhanced testing and provision of advice on arrivals from selected countries based on a risk assessment tool developed in early February [11] . On 15 March, Australian authorities imposed a self-quarantine requirement on all international arrivals, and from 27 March, moved to a mandatory quarantine policy for all international arrivals.

Confidence in the estimated values is indicated by shading, with reduced shading corresponding to reduced confidence. The horizontal dashed line indicates the target value of 1 for the effective reproduction number required for control. Results are produced assuming stepwise changes in the relative infectiousness of locally acquired to imported cases according to quarantine requirements for returning travellers introduced on 15 and 27 March (indicated by vertical grey lines). We assumed 20%, 50%, and 99% of imported cases did not contribute to transmission prior to 15 March, between 15 and 27 March (inclusive), and after 27 March, respectively.",
