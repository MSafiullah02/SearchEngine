A fly in the ointment or a wakeup callWhen we started writing this article active transmission of measles had been eliminated in the UK. However in Birmingham, along with a number of other major UK cities, measles has re-emerged. It is the most infectious disease in the world so ICP protocols are essential to prevent nosocomial spread. How can we achieve this?There are four important steps: recognition, isolation, contact tracing and protection of high risk individuals.1.Recognition.\nWe need to actively educate team members on what clinical measles looks like as the majority will not have seen measles for many years, if at all.2.Isolation of suspected or confirmed cases.\nStaff must isolate patients with measles from other children as soon as it is suspected, especially if they have fever, rash and conjunctivitis. This means that full protective measures should be initiated including wearing face masks, protective fluid shields and ensuring all staff strictly follow the 5 and 6 stages of hand hygiene.3.Contact tracing.\nA complete list of patients and staff exposed needs to be compiled so that vaccine status can be checked and MMR administered within 3 days if necessary.4.Patient and staff with risk factors need to be identified.\nRisk factors include age less than 6 months, immune deficiency, received less than 2 doses of MMR or pregnant. In these cases intramuscular immunoglobulin should be given within 6 days.",

Are there any special ICP procedures that need to be considered in this case?Most young children even with active pulmonary TB are unlikely to be significantly infectious. They do not expectorate sputum, swallowing it instead. However any procedure that leads to potential aerosolisation such as a NG tube placement (vomiting) or hypertonic saline nebuliser are risks and merits staff wearing a FFP3 face mask and visor.The child is unlikely to infect anyone else on your ward but they will have contracted TB from an infectious source, most likely a family member. So before adults and children over 12 years can come onto your ward, without wearing a surgical mask, you need to ensure they do not have active TB. This usually requires them to have a chest X-ray. In this case his mother, the source, had denied any symptoms until she had a chest X-ray. She was smear negative therefore significantly less infectious.

Influenza vaccination of staff should be actively encouraged even though there is limited evidence that this prevents transmission to patients.
