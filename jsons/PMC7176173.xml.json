            "text": "\nMacro domains are conserved in a wide variety of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The name macro domain refers to the early finding that members of this group of proteins are related to the nonhistone domain of the histone macroH2A (Pehrson and Fried 1992). Macro domains are also conserved in a number of positive-strand RNA viruses, including specific genera of the Nidovirales, members of the Togaviridae, Rubella virus and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Gorbalenya et al. 1991; Snijder et al. 2003). The biological role of macro domains in the life cycle of positive-strand RNA viruses has not been resolved. ADRP is a side-product of cellular pre-tRNA splicing, a pathway seemingly unrelated to viral RNA replication. ADRP activity was first identified for a macro domain homolog from yeast using a proteomics approach (Martzen et al. 1999) and subsequently demonstrated for other related proteins including homologs from three coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, TGEV, and SARS-CoV, as well as alphaviruses and HEV (Egloff et al. 2006; Putics et al. 2005, 2006). Inactivation of macro domain-associated ADRP activity in HCoV-229E did not affect viral genome replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis in cell culture, suggesting that the activity, which is conserved across members of the Coronaviridae, may have important functions in vivo, for example in evading antiviral host responses (Putics et al. 2005).",

To date, the catalytic residues of the coronavirus macro domain have not been well defined. Only one absolutely conserved Asn residue (N41, Fig. 7.1a) could be implicated in ADRP activity whereas other residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center are not conserved and therefore less likely to be critically involved in catalysis. Similar to archaebacterial macro domains, SARS-CoV and several other RNA virus macro domains were shown to have poly(ADP-ribose)-binding activities (Egloff et al. 2006). A possible binding mode for poly(ADP-ribose) which does not appear to involve a charged groove (Fig. 7.1b) has been modeled by Egloff et al. (2006). The significance of the observed poly(ADP-ribose)-binding activity and the biologically relevant substrates of RNA virus macro domains are currently not clear and remain to be studied in more detail.\n",

Initial crystallization trials of bacterially expressed SARS-CoV nsp8 remained unsuccessful until 2005, when the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp8 in complex with SARS-CoV nsp7 was solved (Zhai et al. 2005). The crystal structure revealed a hexadecameric complex composed of eight molecules of nsp8 and eight molecules of nsp7 (Fig. 7.3a). This so-called nsp7\u2013nsp8 supercomplex has an intricate hollow cylindrical structure with an inner diameter of about 30 \u00c5.

The inner dimensions and electrostatic properties enable the cylindrical nsp7\u2212nsp8 structure to encircle and interact with nucleic acid.

One of the conformations was described as a \u201cgolf-club\u201d-like structure composed of an N-terminal \u03b1-helical \u201cshaft\u201d domain and a C-terminal, mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 \u201chead\u201d domain (Fig. 7.3b). The second conformation was described as resembling a golf club with a bent shaft, whereas the rest of the structure (particularly, the head domain) is very similar to the first structure (Fig. 7.3b). The eight nsp8 molecules constitute the framework of a large protein complex made up of \u201cbricks\u201d (nsp8) and \u201cmortar\u201d (nsp7), with nsp7 filling some of the remaining space between individual nsp8 molecules, thereby stabilizing the structure of the complex. Despite a number of intricate interactions between nsp7 and nsp8, the absence of nsp7 is not generally thought to markedly change the overall shape of the structure. On the basis of the architecture and electrostatic properties of the complex it was suggested that nsp7\u2212nsp8 might function as a processivity factor, similar to bacterial (\u03b22-clamp) or eukaryotic DNA polymerase processivity factors, such as PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen).",

A recombinant form of the SARS-CoV nsp8 proved to be capable of synthesizing short oligonucleotides (<6 residues). It had relatively low fidelity and strongly preferred RNA with a 5\u2032-(G/U)CC-3\u2032 trinucleotide consensus sequence as a template. Three charged/polar residues, Lys-58, Lys-82 and Ser-85, all of them located in the N-terminal domain, were found to be essential for activity and may be part of a network of residues that catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer reaction. A structure and activity-based model of the nsp8-associated RdRp activity is presented in Fig. 7.3c,d. The structure of the C-terminal \u201chead\u201d domain of nsp8 appears to be distantly related to the catalytic palm subdomain of RNA virus RdRps. Moreover, it was shown that the \u201ccanonical\u201d coronavirus RdRp domain residing in nsp12 contains a conserved sequence, called motif G, that is usually found in primer-dependent RNA polymerases (Gorbalenya et al. 2002). Taken together, the available information suggests that nsp8 may function as a primase to catalyze the synthesis of RNA primers to be used by the primer-dependent coronavirus nsp12 RdRp.",

The studies consistently established that nsp9 is a single-strand RNA/DNA binding protein. The structure of SARS-CoV nsp9 has a central core comprised of seven \u03b2-strands. The core is flanked by a C-terminal \u03b1-helix and an N-terminal extension (Fig. 7.4a). X-ray crystallography, dynamic light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and GST pull-down experiments indicate that nsp9 forms dimers in solution (Campanacci et al. 2003; Imbert et al. 2008; Sutton et al. 2004). RNA binding by nsp9 has been suggested to involve the loops of the \u03b2-barrel domain while the C-terminal \u03b2-hairpin and helix, which are well conserved across coronaviruses, are probably involved in dimerization and interactions with other proteins. Database searches did not reveal structural homologs for nsp9 (Egloff et al. 2004). However, the short six-stranded \u03b2-barrel of nsp9 includes an open five-stranded barrel that is reminiscent of the five-stranded \u03b2-barrel structure of oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding (OB)-fold proteins. About two-thirds of the proteins belonging to this protein superfamily are nucleic acid-binding proteins (Arcus 2002). As in OB-fold proteins, SARS-CoV nsp9 appears to bind nucleic acids by using a network of positively charged amino acids for binding the phosphate backbone of the substrate, whereas several exposed aromatic residues probably make additional stacking interactions with nucleobases (Fig. 7.4b). The nucleic acid-binding properties of nsp9 were subsequently confirmed by surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence quenching studies (Egloff et al. 2004) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Sutton et al. 2004). To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the nucleic acid-binding activity of nsp9 is sequence-specific.\n",

Moreover, the structural disorder of the nsp8 N-terminal region in solution has been reported to decrease when nsp9 was added to a solution containing nsp8 (Sutton et al. 2004). On the basis of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 hexadecameric structure (see Sect. 7.2.2), it was suggested that the most probable nsp9 binding site is formed by the N-terminal 50 residues of nsp8. This part of the structure is close to the entrance of the central pore and appears to be quite flexible, as indicated by the lack of electron density for these residues. Both the nsp9 structure and tryptophan fluorescence quenching data suggest that ssRNA is wrapped around the nsp9 dimer (Egloff et al. 2004). It has been speculated that nsp9 dimers bind to single-stranded nascent and template strands as they emerge from the channel of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex at a time when stable secondary structures have not yet formed, thereby protecting ssRNAs from ribonucleolytic cleavage.",

It was shown that a MHV temperature-sensitive mutant carrying a nonsynonymous mutation in the nsp10 coding sequence has a defect in minus-strand RNA synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature (Sawicki et al. 2005; Siddell et al. 2001). Crystallization of nsp10 revealed monomers and homodimers (Joseph et al. 2006) whereas a complex dodecameric structure was observed when nsp10 was expressed and crystallized as a fusion with nsp11 (Su et al. 2006). The nsp10 monomer consists of a pair of antiparallel N-terminal helices stacked against an irregular \u03b2-sheet, a coil-rich C-terminus, and two zinc fingers (Fig. 7.5).

First, site-directed mutagenesis of the nsp10\u2013nsp11 cleavage site in the MHV genome generated nonviable viruses, indicating that 3CLpro-mediated cleavage at this site is essential for viral replication (Deming et al. 2007). Second, the monomer structure has an intact second zinc finger which appears to stabilize the structure of the C-terminal tail of nsp10. By contrast, in the dodecamer structure, the second zinc finger lacks the C-proximal cysteine residue, resulting in local disorder at the nsp10 carboxyl terminus. Finally, substitutions of residues predicted to be crucial for the dodecamer formation did not cause a lethal phenotype in MHV (Donaldson et al. 2007).",

Distantly-related homologs of NendoU were also identified in some prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they form a small protein family prototyped by XendoU, a Xenopus laevis endoribonuclease involved in the nucleolytic processing of intron-encoded box C/D U16 small nucleolar RNAs (Laneve et al. 2003; Snijder et al. 2003). Mainly on the basis of this sequence relationship, it has been speculated that NendoU may (also) have cellular substrates and it should be interesting to investigate whether NendoU is involved in producing small regulatory RNAs (similar to the small nucleolar RNAs produced by XendoU). Nsp15 activity is significantly stimulated by manganese ions and the enzyme generates 2\u2032\u20133\u2032 cyclic phosphate ends (Ivanov et al. 2004a). It is generally accepted that nsp15 functions as a homohexamer, even though the enzyme has some activity as a monomer (Guarino et al. 2005; Ivanov et al. 2004a; Joseph et al. 2007; Ricagno et al. 2006). NendoU cleaves downstream of uridylates, both in single and double-stranded RNA. The sequence context of the uridylate has been shown to affect cleavage efficiency and differential cleavage efficiencies have been reported for base-paired and nonbase-paired uridylates, respectively (Bhardwaj et al. 2006; Ivanov et al. 2004a).",

Nsp15 exhibits a unique fold and assembles into a toric hexameric structure (Fig. 7.6b) with a central pore and six potentially active catalytic sites at the periphery. Unlike the situation in the nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex, the diameter of the central pore seen in the nsp15 hexamer is too small to accommodate RNA. Furthermore, this part of the structure does not appear to interact with RNA (Bhardwaj et al. 2006; Ricagno et al. 2006). Each protomer contains nine \u03b1-helices and 21 \u03b2-strands (Fig. 7.6a). Alanine substitutions of highly conserved residues demonstrated that the C-terminal domain contains the active site. There are striking similarities between the active site residues of nsp15 and RNase A, suggesting that the enzymes use common catalytic mechanisms, although they are not related in their tertiary structures (Ricagno et al. 2006). The general acid\u2013base mechanism used by coronavirus NendoUs probably involves His-234, His-249, and Lys-289 (SARS-CoV nsp15 numbering). Additional conserved residues likely involved in substrate specificity have been identified by X-ray crytallography and site-directed mutagenesis (Bhardwaj et al. 2008; Ricagno et al. 2006).\n",

Although endonucleases are ubiquitous enzymes that are involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism, they are extremely rare in the RNA virus world, with only very few exceptions (e.g., in orthomyxo-, pesti-, and retroviruses). Although the precise role of the enzyme in the viral life cycle and its biologically relevant substrates remain to be identified, it seems reasonable to think that NendoU acts as part of a larger protein complex and that nucleolytic activity and substrate specificity are tightly regulated by additional factors to minimize uncontrolled nucleolytic cleavage of viral and cellular RNAs.",

A multitude of structural and functional studies into SARS-CoV replicative enzymes have been published over the past few years, giving a major boost to coronavirus and, more generally, nidovirus research. Interestingly, in several instances, crystal structures of coronavirus proteins have uncovered new biochemical and enzymatic activities, thus opening up new vistas for future studies and stimulating exciting biochemical and genetic studies into the biological functions of specific coronavirus nonstructural proteins. Also, the SARS-CoV structural work has been extremely rewarding for crystallographers interested in novel folds and original enzymes. There are still major challenges ahead, mainly with respect to ORF1b-encoded proteins. For example, there is still no crystal structure available for the special type of primer-dependent RNA polymerases encoded by coronaviruses. Also studies of the zinc-binding domain-containing superfamily 1 helicase (Ivanov et al. 2004b) and 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease (Minskaia et al. 2006) domains residing in nsp13 and nsp14, respectively, and the functionally interesting nsp16 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (Decroly et al. 2008) promise to reveal exciting new structural and functional insight. Undoubtedly, these upcoming structures will greatly stimulate coronavirus (nidovirus) research and perhaps even reveal novel and truly unique RNA processing pathways involved in the replication of these viruses.",
