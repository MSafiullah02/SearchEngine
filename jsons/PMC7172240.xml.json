While of course we would all agree that even \u2018the smallest feline is a masterpiece\u2019 (with apologies to Leonardo da Vinci), the study of the pathogens that plague them is (to me at least) the most fascinating aspect of feline medicine. Perhaps part of the reason that cats are so adept at procreation is to stay one step ahead of an abundance of infectious agents, often lurking in clinical silence, waiting to seize on any chink in the armor of the feline immune system.",

While we inch tantalizingly closer each year to understanding this most intriguing of feline viral diseases, our hopes for reliable diagnostic methods and treatment protocols seem to move one step forward and two steps back \u2013 a classic story of the more you know, the more you know you don't know. At least three types of mutations in feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) now command our attention in the transition of a FECV to a feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), two in the spike and one in the accessory 3c genes. They tease us with the possibility of unveiling the molecular secrets underlying the transition from FECV to FIPV and the immune response to infection.",

Eliot was probably not alluding to animal models of human disease when he wrote \u2018You now have learned enough to see that cats are much like you and me\u2019, but nonetheless the sentiment rings true for a number of the articles featured in this issue. The link between infection and cancer is explored in Dr. Julia Beatty's cutting edge review on viral causes of feline lymphoma, in which she announces the successful molecular identification of the first gammaherpesvirus of the domestic cat, Felis catus gammaherpesvirus 1 (FcaGHV1), and explores a possible role for these novel viruses in the pathogenesis of feline lymphoma (Beatty, 2014). Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is the infectious agent most frequently linked with lymphoma in cats, so this novel discovery is exciting news indeed. New information on potential markers of disease progression in FIV-infected cats is also featured in a short communication by Dr. Joanne Meers\u2019 group from the University of Queensland (Kann et al., 2014), while the risks of horizontal and vertical transmission of naturally acquired FIV infection are investigated in a two-part US-based study (Litster, 2014).",

The first paper reports a study which investigated infectious agents identified in cats rescued from large-scale hoarding situations (Polak et al., 2014), while in a second article, the effect of different kinds of shelter management models on the prevalence of upper respiratory pathogens is reported (McManus et al., 2014).
