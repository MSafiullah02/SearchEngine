Participants were recruited from December 2013 to July 2014, from March 2012 to July 2013, and from November 2013 to April 2016, for studies of doctors, nurses, and medical students, respectively. Recruitment employed non-random convenience sampling, with the three samples accessed via a lecture series conducted by one of the authors (A. F.), at medical meetings and hospital grand rounds, contacts and referrals in hospitals and clinics in New Zealand, and e-mails distributed via professional organizations (i.e., District Health Boards, Primary Health Organizations, speciality interest groups, and medical and nursing schools). Inclusion criteria required that participants were practicing as medical professionals, were registered nurses, or were enrolled as medical students in New Zealand. Prospective participants were sent an email containing a link to a description of the study and a 20-min survey.",

Of the 1700 participants included in this study (Table 1), 47.10% were nurses, 30.40% were physicians, and 22.50% were medical students. Across samples, 74.20% were female.

Nurses averaged 26.11 years of clinical experience, physicians 27.02 years, and medical students 1.06 years.

To prevent possible multicollinearity, only clinical experience was included in the regressions, rather than both age and clinical experience.

The study also has a few major limitations\u2014a reliance on self-report measures, use of a cross-sectional and observational design, use of a non-standardized three-item measure of work stress, and the absence of measurement specifically identifying the particular types of stress and self-compassion of relevance. Reliance on self-report may inflate the associations amongst measures (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff 2012) and measures of work stress, burnout, QOL, and self-compassion may be subject to social desirability, self-presentational, and recall biases (Podsakoff & Organ 1986; Podsakoff et al. 2012). Although self-compassion and QOL may be difficult to access outside of-self-report, alternate measures such as the Implicit-Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz 1998) or behavioural measures are worth considering. The cross-sectional and observational design does not allow the direction of causation in the associations between stress, burnout, QOL, and self-compassion to be determined. The non-standardized (but face valid) three-item measure of work stress used in the study might not possess the same level of construct or content validity as a broader or more extensively validated measures of stress (such as the Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen 1994) and different types of stress might be more or less usefully managed with self-compassion. Future studies examining the possible stress-moderating effects of self-compassion in healthcare would benefit from incorporating standardized stress measures capturing different types of stress.",

Of the two, focussing on the specific elements of self-compassion is especially important, given that there are several major ways in which it can be conceptualized (i.e., kindness, common humanity and mindfulness; Germer & Neff 2013), with evidence also indicating that compassion and kindness too may be distinct constructs (Gilbert, Basran, MacArthur, & Kirby 2019). It is also possible that the observed interaction (or lack thereof) between self-compassion and stress in predicting outcomes may be different for different elements of the global self-compassion construct and/or various types of stress. These would be fertile avenues for future research, along with (a) a deeper consideration of how specialization is relevant to the professional dynamics linking stress and self-compassion to outcomes, and (b) a focus on fears regarding self-compassion (e.g., Hermanto et al. 2016; Miron, Sherrill, & Orcutt 2015).",
