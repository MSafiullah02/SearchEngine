A major emphasis of our national biodefense strategy is to establish fast, accurate and sensitive assays for diagnosis of infectious disease agents likely to be used in a bioterrorist event. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have identified three priority classes or \u201cselect agents\u201d of pathogens and toxins. These are designated A, B, and C, and are likely candidates since they can be easily disseminated, usually in aerosol form, require small numbers of organisms or molecules to cause disease, and result in rapid morbidity and mortality.",

As our first line of defense, the vast majority of physicians may not be able to distinguish the early events of a bioterrorist event from other atypical pneumonias or cutaneous infections. The challenge of rapid pathogen or toxin recognition is to aid physicians in the diagnostic process and to help identify at an early stage a potential deliberate outbreak [1]. Such assays will ensure early and appropriate treatment of infected patients, and will alert public health authorities and law enforcement to help contain an outbreak.",

Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms of many of these diseases are nonspecific so it is critical that highly sensitive and reliable tools are available to identify infected individuals. The first step toward effective patient and public health control is to identify rapidly the infecting pathogen and its source. Some of these select agents are highly transmissible in the early stages of disease and it is critical to identify infected patients to limit the risk to the remainder of the population. In some cases, such as hemorrhagic fever with Ebola virus, it is hypothesized that patients become infected through contact with an infected animal. Yet, the natural reservoir of the virus is unknown, as is the manner in which the virus first appears in a human at the start of an outbreak [4]. Whether the initial source can be elucidated or not, rapid diagnostic procedures are critical to support infection control measures that monitor and limit the spread of infectious diseases agents [5, 6]. Finally, accurately defining the scope and progression of an infectious disease outbreak helps mobilize resources more efficiently and eases public anxiety that can lead to panic [7].",

Most clinical laboratories, however, still rely upon culture-based technology with phenotypic endpoints, approved by FDA and/or CDC. These assays can take several days for definitive results. In addition to time delays, these techniques often lack adequate sensitivity and specificity and some organisms are difficult to isolate in culture. Delays often translate into the initiation of empiric therapy in the absence of positive pathogen identification. The problem is not limited to a bioterrorism outbreak as hospital and public health laboratories, confounded by inadequate and slow methodology for pathogen detection, often have difficulty identifying pathogens. When occurring with very ill and/or immunocompromised patients, these delays can increase morbidity and mortality.",

The inadequacy of phenotypic-based diagnostic assays is illustrated graphically by the \u201cgold standard\u201d public health laboratory-testing algorithm that was in place for positive identification of Bacillus anthracis from environmental samples during the October 2001 anthrax outbreak (Fig. 16.1a\n). A complicated matrix of phenotypic and biochemical assays required 3\u20135 days for a positive endpoint. What was needed was a streamlined approach that could progress from primary specimen to a positive or negative outcome in a matter of hours or less (Fig. 16.1b). Rapid diagnostics have finally come of age and offer exceptional promise in this regard for accurate pathogen identification.\n\n",

While conventional serodiagnosis has a limited ability to detect acute infections with select agents, it is invaluable for monitoring disease kinetics and dispersion of these agents within exposed or high-risk populations, especially where asymptomatic infections are frequent. Such information is crucial to therapeutic intervention and prophylaxis, as well as to isolation protocols in the context of a biological attack. Serodiagnosis is particularly useful for mass screening of infectious diseases because such techniques are generally simple to perform, inexpensive and amenable to high throughput technologies. The assay takes advantage of the exquisite sensitivity and specificity of antigen-antibody interactions. Antigen capture assays represent a somewhat more recent addition to serological techniques. These methods have been useful for rapidly diagnosing acute infections where antigen levels are relatively high, especially in the urine where they may be concentrated.",

It relies on specific antigen-antibody interactions to identify a pathogen [10]. Typically, a preliminary test can be performed quickly, usually within 3\u20134 h. A positive ELISA test can be confirmed by performing a Western Blot with target-specific antibodies or by an immunofluorescent antibody (IFA). Unfortunately, pathogen antigen production or a host antibody response is not always robust enough to permit reliable testing, especially in the early stages of an infection. In addition, a false positive result with an ELISA test can occur due to interference from other antibodies. Although the ELISA test is highly specific, an antibody response may not be detected in either the early or late stages of a disease. Improved sensitivity may be obtained by expanding the class of antibodies detected to IgG, IgA and/or IgM classes of antibodies [11].",

A newer format for antigen-antibody detection where the detector antibody is labeled by chemiluminescence facilitates an even greater sensitivity [13]. In one approach, target antigen is first complexed to paramagnetic beads coated with capture antibody and then identified using a detector antibody. An electrochemical flow cell with photon detector is used to detect the target-antibody interactions with detection limits approaching 200 fmol/L and dynamic ranges of six orders of magnitude [10]. More recently, a novel type of biosensor for rapid pathogen identification has been described using B cells as sensing elements. This system know as CANARY (cellular analysis and notification of antigen risks and yields) utilizes B lymphocytes genetically engineered to express both cytosolic aquorin, a calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein, and membrane bound antibodies specific for a given pathogen or toxin [14]. Interactions of antigen with antibody elevate intracellular calcium levels resulting in light emission by the cytosolic aquorin molecules. The system responds in a fashion that is more rapid, sensitive, and specific than most antigen detection systems, and has been shown to detect Yersinia pestis in less than 3 min at levels of 50 colony forming units [14].",

Genetic-based molecular assays are currently in development that not only include all category A through C pathogen and toxin genes but also include a wide range of common bacteria, viruses and fungi. With this approach, it is possible to recognize in clinical (respiratory secretions, blood, urine, tissue), environmental (including letters, nasal swabs and hair) and food or water samples the presence of a pathogenic organism that is present as a homogeneous population or is cloaked by dispersion within a large population of nonpathogenic organisms. It is also possible to detect unnatural events such as the expression of a lethal toxin gene (such as a botulinum toxin genes) in a recipient nonpathogenic organism such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. Similarly, a mixed powder containing anthrax-laden spores in a background of 99.9% B. subtilis spores would be perceived as harmless, until the 0.1% B. anthracis component began to cause disease.

They can also be used in real-time assays in which product formation is continuously monitored and validated. This is an important consideration for a clinical microbiology lab because PCR amplification has the potential to amplify small amounts of target DNA from contaminating organisms or even human DNA. Real-time PCR does not require post-PCR sample handling, preventing potential PCR product carry-over contamination and facilitating high throughput assays.

The LightCycler system measures the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two linear oligonucleotide probes labeled with different fluorophores in a glass capillary tube format. The probes are hybridized to the target in a head-to-tail motif during the annealing stage of the PCR which bring the fluorophores in a close proximity, causing a transfer of energy resulting in an emission of a detectable fluorescent light. TaqMan probes are linear oligonucleotides that contain a 5\u2032 reporter dye and 3\u2032 acceptor with overlapping emission-absorption spectra. The reporter dye remains quenched by the 3\u2032 acceptor, while hybridized to its target. Cleavage of the 5\u2032 reporter by 5\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase results in strong fluorescence signals. TaqMan can be utilized in a 96 well format, amenable to high throughput screening. One limitation of FRET-based systems is that multiplexing is more limited since several quenchers in the same reaction are required and spectral overlap can be a problem. Molecular Beacons are small, single stranded nucleic acid hairpin probes that brightly fluoresce when bound to their targets [43]. The probes possess a stem and loop structure in which the loop contains a complementary target sequence. The stem forms by the annealing of short complementary nucleotide sequence arms adjacent to the target sequence. A fluorophore is covalently linked to one end of the stem sequence with a quencher covalently linked to the other end. In free solution, Molecular Beacons do not fluoresce because the stem structure keeps the fluorophore close to the quencher and fluorescence energy is absorbed and released as heat. In the presence of target DNA, however, the loop sequence anneals to the target and a probe-target hybrid is formed forcing the stems containing the fluorophore and quencher apart, and fluorescence occurs. Molecular Beacons are better suited than most linear probes to monitor authentic amplicons in PCR reactions because a single nucleotide mismatch can prevent a Molecular Beacon from binding to its target and lighting up [24]. Both TaqMan and Molecular Beacons can detect single nucleotide changes and are highly suitable for allelic discrimination [24, 44].",

Typically, different probes are labeled with a range of fluorophores that have unique emission spectra that can be discerned with discrete optics or dispersed onto an array for detection. When dealing with fluorophores, the spectral properties of the probe-target hybrid must be significantly different from the unbound probes to permit unambiguous probe identification. LightCyclerTM, TaqManTM and Molecular Beacon probes are all suitable for multiplex assays.

Nucleic acids are amplified by multiplex PCR using up to 64 primers, each labeled by a photo-cleavable link with a different molecular weight tag.

Sample preparation depends on the type of biological material that vary in consistency and viscosity. Highly viscous samples (such as mucous) can be difficult to handle and process. Bacterial and fungal spores are encased in a heat and largely chemical resistant shell, making the isolation of nucleic acids troublesome. New cell and spore disruption techniques involving mechanical, chemical, enzymatic and thermal treatments have improved extraction efficiencies markedly [48\u201351].",

When possible, liquid biological samples should be centrifuged to concentrate bacteria, spores and fungi prior to nucleic acid extraction, increasing purity and efficiency. Anticoagulants such as EDTA, heparin or citrate can limit product formation by interfering with the PCR as can large excesses of free genomic DNA. Differential surface-based binding procedures have been developed to purify and concentrate target DNA away from genomic DNA and host-associated inhibitors, improving sensitivity. Magnetic bead technology is an ideal choice for nucleic acid isolation and purification because of its greater affinity for nucleic acids than other conventional methods. It reduces the risk of sample cross contamination found in other extraction methods by eliminating centrifugation and other manual steps during the extraction and purification process. Magnetic bead based nucleic acid extraction can be performed from micro (<100 \u03bcL) volume samples, is completely automated for high throughput and can rapidly isolate purified nucleic acid in about 1 h. Commercial systems such as MagNA Pure LCTM, KingFisherTM and NucliSens easyMAG\u2122 are readily available in clinical laboratories for extraction of both DNA and RNA from a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi present in clinical samples. These standardized products allow for highly efficient target capture and are scalable over a wide range of nucleic acid levels.

Genetic-based rapid assays were developed for all major threat list agents for which adequate genomic sequence is available, as well as for other pathogens requested by various government agencies.
