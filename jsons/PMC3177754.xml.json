            "text": "The development of effective antiviral immunity requires robust and specific immune activation during acute virus infection. This process is dependent on the ability of the host cell to first sense the viral pathogen and then to signal within the infected cell, alerting neighboring bystander cells and adaptive immune cells that a viral infection is underway. This form of cellular communication requires that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) work in concert to sense specific pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by the virus which are distinct from the host. Several PRRs have now been described to sense and distinguish viral PAMPs. The toll-like receptor (TLR) family of PRRs resides at the cell surface and in endosomal compartments and are poised to sense extracellular or actively engulfed pathogens but not those in the cytoplasm [1]. By contrast, several PRRs have been identified that recognize microbial products within the cytoplasm of infected cells. These include the nuclear oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), proinflammatory DNA-binding receptors such as AIM2 and DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1), and the RLRs [2, 3]. Although we now have a strong understanding of the signaling pathways which PRRs engage in response to viral infection, it is only in the past few years that we have began to understand the unique crosstalk that exists between these pathways. This review will present an overview of contemporary studies defining RLR function and their signaling crosstalk that programs the immune response to virus infection.",

            "text": "The RLR family members include retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation gene-5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology-2 (LGP2). They contain a distinct DEX/DH box RNA helicase domain involved in RNA binding and ATPase function to drive a conformation change that initiates signaling activation [4]. In addition, RIG-I and MDA5 but not LGP2 contain two N-terminal Caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) which facilitate their interactions with other CARD containing molecules. These CARD\u2013CARD interactions promote RIG-I/MDA5 binding to interferon promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1; also called MAVS/VISA/Cardif) through a CARD\u2013CARD interaction, leading to IPS-1-dependent activation of interferon regulator factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [5]. These processes result in transcriptional activities that direct the expression of IFN and the induction of a variety of antiviral effector genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose actions limit virus replication and spread [6]. Furthermore, the C-terminus of RIG-I and LGP2 has been described as a repressor domain (RD) that acts to keep these molecules in an inactive \u2018closed\u2019 confirmation in the absence of activating RNA [7].",

In these studies, the DNA mimetic poly (dA:dT) was found to trigger IFN responses in a RIG-I-dependent manner. This was driven by the host cell RNA polymerase III, which functioned to transcribe DNA to RNA ligands that were then recognized by RIG-I in the cytosol. Several DNA viruses have now been shown to activate this pathway including herpes-simplex virus-1, Adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and Vaccinia virus (VV) (Figure 1) [15\u2022\u2022, 16\u2022\u2022, 17, 18]. Surprisingly, the intracellular gram negative bacterium, Legionella pnuemophila, was also shown to activate type I IFN responses through RIG-I signaling [16\u2022\u2022]. It is likely that other intracellular bacterium will be identified to trigger this pathway thus reflecting a broad role for RLR signaling in anti-microbial immunity.",

            "text": "The characterization of PAMP motifs that are recognized by RLRs to trigger innate immune signaling is ongoing. RIG-I was initially described to bind dsRNA [19] however, key findings have now identified that ssRNA containing a 5\u2019tri-phosphate motif (5\u2019ppp) was required for recognition by RIG-I [20, 21]. This interaction provides a way by which RIG-I can distinguish between host and viral RNAs as host mRNAs are capped at their 5\u2019 ends while mature tRNA and rRNA lack 5\u2019ppp and are covered as ribonucleoproteins respectively, thus preventing 5\u2019ppp from recognition by RIG-I. This concept has been called into question by studies that showed that in addition to 5\u2019ppp, RIG-I triggering requires some double stranded nature in the RNA, and that previous studies involving the 5\u2019ppp contained double stranded hairpins that were introduced by the T7 polymerase in vitro [22]. An examination of 5\u2019ppp RNA generated with non-hairpin coding polymerases is necessary to for definitive demonstration of this however. A study by Saito et al. [23] has also revealed a mechanism for self/non-self recognition by RIG-I. Here, it was shown that RIG-I engagement actually requires 5\u2019ppp and specific sequences including uridine or adenosine-rich regions that are found within a PAMP motif of the Hepatitis C virus RNA and a number of other viruses recognized by RIG-I [23]. In the case of HCV, deletion of this region form the viral RNA abolished RIG-I binding despite the presence of 5\u2019ppp. Thus, multiple motifs likely mark a viral RNA as non-self, including 5\u2019ppp and specific sequence domains and secondary structures.",

            "text": "RLR activation is thought to trigger the formation of an IPS-1 antiviral signaling complex or signalsome anchored at mitochondria-associated membranes, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. However, it is currently unclear how signaling at these distinct sites is orchestrated [25, 26\u2022]. IPS-1 signaling leads to activation of Tank Binding Kinase-1 (TBK-1) and I\u03baB kinase \u025b (IKK\u025b) which then mediates downstream activation of IRFs and NF-\u03baB as well as IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression [12]. Several adaptors have been characterized to function in this complex including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) associated factors (TRAFs), TRAF3 [27], and TRAF2/TRAF6 [28, 29], NEMO/Ikk\u03b3 [30], Fas-associated death domain (FADD), receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1), TRADD and Caspase 8 and 10 [31]. These molecules participate in distinct signaling responses which drive the bifurcation of IRF and NF-\u03baB; the findings of which have been reviewed in great detail elsewhere [12, 32] (Figure 2\n). In addition, to IPS-1, another adaptor molecule, stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA) was shown to interact with RIG-I and IPS-1 and potentiate IRF/IFN activation [33, 34]. Further analysis has demonstrated that STING/MITA play crucial roles to IFN induction upon DNA stimulation however, the significance for STING/MITA in RLR signaling during RNA viral infection is still an area of contention.",

LGP2 itself was found to act as both a positive and negative regulator of RLR signaling, wherein its over expression enhanced ISG induction to a variety of viruses including SeV and NDV [35, 36, 37], and LGP2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed increased IFN responses and decreased susceptibility to VSV but not EMCV infection in vitro and in vivo [38]. By contrast, examination of an independently generated LGP2\u2212/\u2212 mouse line or mice with mutations in the LGP2 ATP binding site (LGP2K30A/K30A) demonstrated decreased IFN responses and increased susceptibility to VSV, EMCV, SeV, JEV but not IAV [39]. These differences could be due in part to genetic background distinctions of mouse lines, as well as the nature of each targeting construct used to make the LGP2 null lines. A more complete examination of LGP2 in a cell/murine strain-specific manner is required for understanding the function of LGP2 in RLR signaling of immunity.",

In line with these observations, the E3 ligase, Triad3A was also shown to target TRAF3 for degradation via K48-ubiquitination [44].

In line with this idea, the de-ubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) has been shown to directly interact with TRAF3 and mediate the removal of K63-ub chains.

By contrast, the proteosome molecule, PSMA7(\u03b14) subunit was shown to bind directly to IPS-1 and limit its ability to translate downstream IFN signals. This regulation operates though a mechanism dependent on proteosomal degradation of IPS-1. In addition, since VSV infection triggers expression of PSMA7\u03b14, this factor may act as a negative feedback loop stimulated by virus infection [48]. PCBP2 was also shown to interact with IPS-1 and mediate its ubiquitination and degradation by the E3 ligase AIP4 [49], while the autophagy conjugate Atg5\u2013Atg12 was shown to regulate RLR signaling by interacting directly with both RIG-I and IPS-1 to limit downstream IFN production [50]. Specific regulation of MDA5 function by protein interactions is less well understood. However, regulation of MDA5 has been described to occur via the dihydroacetone kinase (DAK), in which overexpression of the molecule led to decreased IFN responses to MDA5 agonists. Further, DAK was found to interact with MDA5 but not RIG-I suggesting that the mechanism for action was at the level of preventing MDA5 activation and interaction with IPS-1 [33]. Further comparison of regulatory mechanism involved in RIG-I versus MDA5-specific signaling are required in order to define the processes of RLR regulation through protein interaction.",

Two recent studies have identified unique roles for Caspase family members in the regulation of RLR signaling. Caspase-8 has been shown to associate with the IPS-1 signalsome via interactions with FADD, RIP-1 and IPS-1 after dsRNA stimulation of cells [31]. Caspase-8 may function to suppress RLR signaling through two distinct mechanisms. First, Caspase-8 promotes a direct depletion of RIG-I, through a mechanism dependent on its ability to bind FADD but independent of its catalytic cleavage ability. Secondly, Caspase-8 cleaves RIP1 at the IPS-1 signalsome/RLR signaling complex which leads to loss of IFN induction [52\u2022]. Both of these functions of Caspase-8 are thought to act to negatively regulate and shut down the RLR response at later times after initial RLR triggering during acute virus infection. However further interrogation into the mechanism by which RIP-1 cleavage mediates this regulation is required in order to fully understand how this process regulates the IPS-1 signalsome and RLR functions.",

The exact mechanism by which Caspase-12 regulates TRIM25 was not described in this study, therefore warranting further analyses. In addition, as only a small percentage of the human population expresses Caspase-12 its role in regulation of the RLRs in humans remains debatable. Despite this caveat, these studies identify the potential for cross-talk between RLRs and Caspase signaling pathways as a regulatory feature that governs the innate antiviral immune response. Since CARD\u2013CARD interactions play an important role in both RLR signaling and Caspase responses, further interactions between such CARD proteins will likely be identified and revealed as regulatory interactions.",

            "text": "Viral targeting of RLR signaling components has also been described. In particular, the cleavage and inactivation of IPS-1 by multiple viruses has been shown as a mechanism for RLR antagonism. The HCV protease, NS3/4A cleaves IPS-1, removing it from intracellular membranes and preventing RLR signaling of IFN induction, resulting in increased cell permissiveness to HCV [55, 56]. In addition, the Coxsackie virus protease B3C was recently shown to cleave IPS-1 and block downstream signaling responses, while the Hepatitis A virus protease precursor, 3ABC, was shown to cleave IPS-1 [57, 58]. Other viruses have been shown to block RLR signaling by sequestering signaling components or targeting their degradation through host machinery. The V proteins of several Paramyxoviruses have been shown to directly bind MDA5 and block its downstream signaling actions [59, 60]. Further, the NS1 protein of IAV was also shown to directly bind and sequester RIG-I from its downstream signaling complex [61]. Importantly, NS1 was also shown to directly bind TRIM25 and effectively block K63-ub of RIG-I [62\u2022]. This activity is of interest as it demonstrates the ability of viruses to not only target the RLR signaling pathway but a key pathway involved in RLR signaling and metabolism as well. More recently, the Arenavirus family member, LCMV, was also shown to directly interact with RIG-I and MDA5 through its nuclear protein (NP). Here, NP functioned to modulate the late phase of IFN production both in vitro and in vivo; however, the mechanism of this regulation and interaction has yet to be elucidated [63].",

The Hepadna virus, Hepatitis B virus X protein can bind IPS-1 and target it for degradation via K63 ubiquitination [64]. The VV virus protein E3 was also shown to bind RNA polymerase III generated RNAs and may act to prevent their recognition by RIG-I [18]. The protease of HIV, a lentivirus, was also recently shown to sequester RIG-I and limit ISG induction, thus linking RIG-I signaling to recognition of HIV-derived nucleic acid products [65]. However, as HIV RNA is known to be capped and polyadenylated it is unclear as to the actual viral RNA species which could actively trigger the RLR pathway during HIV infection. In addition, to blockade of RLR signaling by HIV, recent studies from our lab and others have demonstrated HIV directly depletes IRF-3 to block ISG induction downstream of TLR, RLR and other signaling pathways [66, 67]. This activity has been linked to the viral proteins Vpr, Vif [67] and now Vpu (Doehle et al. submitted) and appears a common mechanism employed by multiple viruses [68].

            "text": "NLRs play important roles in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial genes, and inflammasome activation. For example, the NLR, NOD2 is known to signal through the adaptor RIP2 to trigger NF-\u03baB upon activation by the bacterial cell wall component, muramyl-dipeptide (MDP) [69]. NLRs, NLRC4, NLRP1 and NLPR3 are likewise involved in the activation of inflammasome cleavage of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and IL-33 [51]. Interestingly, two recent reports have identified unique links between RLRs and NLRs in these signaling responses. First, Sabbah et al. [70\u2022\u2022] demonstrated that NOD2 could respond to viral infection and mediate the activation of IRF-3 and that this was mediated through direct interactions between NOD2 and IPS-1. This response occurred through the recognition of ssRNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a novel ligand for NOD2, which triggered the activation of IRF-3 and IFN expression. This study indicates for the first time, a model in which a bacterial trigger of NOD2 drives a RIP2-dependent activation of NF-\u03baB genes while viral infection triggers an NOD2/IPS-1 driven IRF-3 response, thus defining host-pathogen interactions of polymicrobial infection. It is unclear whether NOD2 acts as a direct sensor for ssRNA or simply associates with RNA binding factors. One intriguing possibility is that NOD2 may interact with RIG-I or MDA5 which then sense the ssRNA, thus triggering IPS-1 dependent signaling (Figure 4\n). Polymicrobial infection presents complexities of host interactions that are likely to engage a variety of response pathways, including RLRs, NLRs, and others. Future studies are necessary to define these interactions and their role in polymicrobial infection and immunity.",

Interestingly, RIG-I and MDA5 could directly interact with CARD9 to drive this response during acute VSV infection or 5\u2019ppp RNA stimulation.

Cellular factors known to contribute to regulation of multiple stages of RLR signaling are depicted in the figure. Factors involved in ubiquitin mediated regulation are denoted in red text, factors which require direct interaction with RLR signaling components are depicted in blue text and factors with unknown mechanisms of regulation are shown in black text.",

Both RIG-I and MDA5 can interact with CARD9/BCL10 to activate NF-\u03baB. This leads to induction of pro-IL-1\u03b2. RIG-I but not MDA5 can directly associate with ASC bifurcating NLR mediated activation of Caspase-1. This leads to cleavage of IL-1\u03b2 and secretion from the cell.",
