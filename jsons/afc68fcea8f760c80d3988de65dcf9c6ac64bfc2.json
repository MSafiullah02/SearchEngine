This review first describes the needs for biodefense, which include protection of civilian populations with detect-to-warn and detect-to-treat modalities, and the needs of the military. The different microfluidic technologies applied to each step of threat detection are then discussed. The technology areas covered are microscale 324 Jovanovich and Horn sample preparation, immunomagnetic separations, immunoassays, toxin detection, proteomics, microarrays, and microelectrophoresis. For each technology area, the potential microfluidic solutions are introduced and current relevant examples are described. For each area, the potential applications to biodefense are detailed. The present state of fully integrated microfluidic devices is reviewed. Finally, perspectives for the future are discussed.",

This incident sparked the testing of tens of thousands of samples for the presence of anthrax, straining the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) system. The New York City experience after the anthrax attacks is telling [3] . The increase in incoming samples went from one every several months to about 6,000 in two weeks, requiring a coordinate growth of analytical staff and laboratories by over twenty-fold. The operational expectation had been that any surge would primarily be composed of human clinical samples; instead most of the samples were environmental. A recent study of acute care facilities in Mississippi found that the diagnostic capacity of hospitals would be overwhelmed by a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) attack [4] ; similar conclusions regarding the lack of diagnostic surge capacity in alternate locales were reached in other studies [5] [6] .",

For example, reduced consummable use, weight and size are directly tied to the drastic reduction of reaction volume employed in microfluidic systems and the use of miniaturized microfluidic components. Increasing the number of recognized agents can also be accomodated without high order reaction multiplexing by using multi-channel microfluidic devices with single-plex reactions carried out in parallel. In theory, with microfabricated microchips adding more channels is simple a 'cut and paste' exercise once the issues of connections and integation are solved. There are considerable issues in integrating all processing and analysis steps in a 'hands-free' device. However, microfluidics requires a 'hands-free' implementation once samples are loaded since typically there is nothing the user can do to intervene.",

Microvalves replace both conventional valves and tubing between reservoirs providing a leak-free, self-contained fluid transport. The BeadStorm module manipulates input liquid and swabs of biological samples by bead purifying the samples, fully preparing them for downstream analysis such as PCR and immunoassays. Immunomagnetic separations have also been performed in this format. The BeadStorm device has been successfully used to automate DNA extraction from buccal swabs for STR amplification.

IMS is used to capture, concentrate, and then purify specific target antigens, proteins, toxins, nucleic acids, cells, and spores in a single step. IMS works by binding a specific affinity reagent, typically an antibody, to paramagnetic beads, which are only magnetic in the presence of an external magnetic field. The beads can be added to complex samples such as aerosols, liquids, bodily fluids, or food. After binding of the target to the affinity reagent (which itself is bound to the paramagnetic bead) the bead is captured by application of a magnetic field. Unbound or loosely bound material is removed by washing purifing the target from other, unwanted materials in the original sample. A similar approach can purify nucleic acids using a complementary nucleic acid strand attached to a bead. Because beads are small and bind high levels of target, when the beads are concentrated by magnetic force, they form bead beds measured in the hundreds of nanoliters (or as low as a single bead), thus concentrating the target at the same time it is purified. The purified and concentrated targets can be conveniently transported, denatured, lysed or analyzed on-bead, or eluted off-bead for further sample preparation and analysis. Immunomagnetic separations are commonly used as an upstream purification step before qPCR, electrochemiluminescence, and magnetic force discrimination.",

IMS has also been coupled with qPCR [78] , fluorescence microscopy, and solid-phase laser scanning cytometry [79] . Key parameters affecting detection sensitivity were shown to include the amount of nanoparticles per assay, immunoreaction incubation time, concentration of the target organism, matrix background, and interferents. Generally, interference by non-target microorganisms is less than 1% [80] . IMS can also be combined with PCR to effectively increase the specificity of the overall process by combining the specificity of antibody-antigen recognition and the sensitivity of PCR.

The gold aggregates due to the bivalency of the antibodies and produces a line that is visible by eye. Home pregnancy tests are probably the best-known lateral flow devices. Lateral flow devices are simple to use, require little training or equipment, and have been devised to detect biothreat agents. Simple dipstick immunoassays for E. coli O157:H7 can detect 1 cell per g in ground beef, after outgrowth of the sample [89] .

A poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microfluidic immunoassay device was modified with poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), an amine-bearing polymer, to increase antibody binding ten-fold [101] ; the authors believe this is due to the spacer effect as well as the addition of amine groups. Due to the smaller dimensions, the microchip reactions were ten-fold faster than 96 well plates and had a dynamic range of 5 to 1000 ng/mL. An early study using glass capillary tubes as a solid support to assay E. coli O157:H7 employed a competitive-based immunoassay and achieved a detectable limit of 1 cfu per 10 g of ground beef [102] .

This basic design became the Rapid Cycler (Idaho Technologies), the forerunner to RAZOR, in use today for biodefense applications. Sample volumes were reduced to 1-10 uL with cycling times of less than 15 min [157] . A medium-throughput automated capillary sample preparation system that processed 1,000 one uL samples per day was developed [158] ; the Acapella-1K (U. Washington, Seattle) utilized a mechanical capillary handling system, air cycling, and a piezoelectric reagent dispenser [159] . Jovanovich and co-workers developed a 500 nL sample preparation system also using an air cycler with a 384-channel capillary cassette (Fig. 10.2) . This system used 150 um ID capillaries without a coating and standard PCR conditions (except for elevated Mg +2 concentrations). DNA samples were forced onto the surface of the glass capillary using chaotrophic agents, the DNA-coated capillary was then evacuated, and 500 nL of PCR reagents re-filled the tube by capillary action. PCR reaction efficiencies were equivalent to full volume reactions.",

            "text": "One of the first miniaturized real-time PCR instruments was developed for biodefense applications. The Advanced Nucleic Acid Analyzer (ANAA), devised at LLNL, used an array of 10 silicon reaction chambers with thinfilm resistive heaters and solid-state optics to rapidly test samples for simulants of biothreat agents with detection limits of 100 to 1,000/mL [183] [184] . A compact version of a qPCR instrument with a notebook computer, two reaction modules with integrated four-color fluorescence detection was developed and shown to detect Bacillus spores [166] . A handheld device, the Handheld Advanced Nucleic Acid Analyzer (HANAA), also developed at LLNL, used plastic reaction tubes with silicon and platinum-based thermal cycler units and two light emitting diodes to detect bacteria including B. anthracis Ames [185] . The LLNL group, working with Sandia, went on to develop the APDS, which performs continuous monitoring with a multiplexed immunoassay trigger and confirmatory qPCR assays. This has been demonstrated for aerosolized B. anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Bacillus globigii, and botulinum toxin [186] . LLNL and Sandia also developed a \"Biobriefcase\" device with a smaller footprint that has multiplexed, autonomous detection with immunoassays, toxin assays, and qPCR. The Biobriefcase incorporated inhibitor removal and concentrated the sample by mixing aerosol-collected liquid with a chaotrophic agent prior to silica bead bed purification [187] . The LLNL group has also developed a 10-plex PCR amplification with hybridization to beads upstream of a flow cytometry readout; 1000 samples were processed in 8 hours [188] . The LightCycler (Idaho Technology) has been adapted into a \"ruggedized\" Advanced Pathogen Identification Device, RAPID, which has been used for field analysis of bioagents and pathogens [189] . Y. pestis was detected at about 20 genome equivalents in 75 min using this system. The latest innovation from LLNL is amplification in emulsion of single copy DNA in a lab-on-a-chip format; the system produces 10 pL droplets that can perform qPCR with thresholds exceeded significantly earlier than conventional instruments [190] .",

DNA microarray technology is a widely used powerful technique that uses large arrays of microspots of DNA on a solid support or beads to detect complementary DNA or RNA products from a sample. (Protein arrays were briefly discussed in the Proteomics section). For RNA samples, amplification of RNA is commonly done by first performing reverse transcriptase to create DNA from RNA, and then the resulting DNA can be amplified using standard DNA amplification methods such as PCR, or whole genome amplification, or by in vitro transcription followed by another cycle of re-verse transcriptase. Fluorescent labeling can be introduced into the sample at various steps in the process. Typically, tens of thousands of spots, each containing a unique sequence, are interrogated in a single experiment with fluorescent detection. The data can represent a fingerprint of the transcriptional state of an organism (e.g. biothreat agent, or of the response of a human potentially infected with the agent), identify DNA sequences present in an organism, or resequence organisms [207] [208] . The strength of the microarray platform is the depth of characterization. The 10,000s of analytes measured on a single microarray slide can generate massive amounts of data. In the future, DNA microarrays may be displaced or challenged by digital gene expression methods using next-generation DNA sequencing to produce 100,000's or more sequences from a sample or single mRNA detection and enumeration strategies (e.g., Nanostring).",

AFLP is rapid-it employs a relatively simple multi-step workflow with standard reagents regardless of the organism typed. AFLP has been applied to differentiate a wide variety of microorganisms at the subspecies level [228] , including B. anthracis [229] and is widely used to classify plants, yeasts, and other organisms. The AFLP process begins with a two-enzyme restriction digest followed by ligation of fluorescently labeled restriction half-site adapters to reconstruct the restriction site at the end of the fragments and serve as PCR primers. Two or three degenerate nucleotides on the end of the adapter reduce the complexity of the amplified products during the high stringency PCR amplification. By selection of proper restriction enzyme pairs, fluorescently labeled fragments in the range of 100 to 1,000 bases can be produced, and then are separated and detected by capillary electrophoresis. The resultant pattern is a fingerprint of the test organisms' genomic and extra-chromosomal restriction patterns. A post-labeling fluorescent method using dye-terminator chemistry can visualize both RFLP and AFLP products [230] . cDNA-AFLP can also be performed to visualize the gene expression pattern of an organism [231] .",

The classic Twin-T injector defines roughly a 100 to 500 picoliter volume in a short sample plug (100 to 500 um) in the separation channel with electrokinetic loading [250] . This is only a small fraction of the sample, even if the prepared sample is only 100 nL: for biodefense applications this means losing orders of magnitude of potential sensitivity during the analysis step. This can be ameliorated with isotachaphoresis, field amplified stacking, DNA binding, and other methods that locally increase the sample concentration. Isotachaphoresis concentrates samples between leading and trailing electrolytes and can increase detection limits by 50-fold or more for DNA [251] [252] , and stack up to a million-fold [253] . Field amplified sample stacking, routinely used in capillary electrophoresis, has been adapted to microchip electrophoresis using pressure driven flows to move low osmotic strength samples into position for stacking on the column. Concentration effects range from 65-fold increase in signals [254] to 180-fold for model compounds [255] .",

Swerdlow and colleagues developed an automated prototype with a sample loop in an air cycler coupled to a separation capillary [274] . A fully integrated miniaturized integrated microsystem using capillaries was shown to perform all steps including PCR amplification in 125 nL and separations starting from buccal cells [275] . Integration of PCR reactions in capillaries with separations in capillaries has been shown to be effective for DNA typing from blood [276] and other materials for human and viral targets [277] . PCR reactions and DNA cycle sequencing in capillaries and capillary separations have been fully integrated to create a microvolume system with readlengths of 257 bases in 4 hrs from human DNA [278] . PCR reaction chambers have now been monolithically integrated with microelectrophoresis to create fully integrated microsystems that perform PCR on the same device as the separation. Burns et al. integrated sample preparation, gel electrophoresis, and on-chip detection for low resolution separation of DNA fragments [279] . The Mathies lab showed PCR amplification and microelectrophoresis separation to determine sex of humans from DNA in 15 min [280] . A portable system with 200 nL PCR reactors, solid state lasers, pneumatically actuated on-chip micropumps, and microelectrophoresis was able to detect 2-3 E. coli or S. aureus cells in less than 10 min including determining drug resistance [281] . The Mathies lab has extended their DNA sequencing on microchips upstream to include integrated nanovolume sample preparation and purification. First, nanoscale PCR reactions were combined with capillary electrophoresis analysis [282] . Then, sample preparation, cleanup, and DNA separations were combined to integrate DNA sequencing, as shown in Fig. 10 .3, [283] . A 250 nL cycle sequencing reaction was performed on microchip, and then moved by micropumps onto an acrylamide gel capture matrix with an oligonucleotide hybridization probe to capture the target DNA in a 60 nL capture chamber. The affinity capture removes template DNA, desalts, and pre-concentrates the sample for microchip electrophoresis for higher injection efficiencies. The sample is then electrophoresed into an injector and separated on microchip. Readlengths up to 556 bases were obtained from 1 fmol of template. The key to the integration was pneumatically actuated microvalves and micropumps [288] .",

The probes bind to their homologous targets, if present. The labeled DNA is then moved through a narrow channel one molecule at a time where it is interrogated by laser-induced fluorescence. The resulting pattern of binding sites is a fingerprint that can identify known and unknown agents from a database [287] . One advantage of the approach is the analysis of individual molecules is done without apriori knowledge of the sequence. This potentially enables detection of genetically engineered or previously unknown pathogens. In the future, next generation DNA sequencers, mass spectroscopy, and DNA microarrays will provide additional solutions to begin to address genetically engineered organisms.",
