The present study analyses changes in cause\u2010specific mortalities and hospital admissions during and for 2 days after weekends and Christmas. The hypothesis was that reduced medical services in holiday periods might be able to handle everyone requiring rapid lifesaving treatment if they happened at a time of average demand, such as average weekends, but not when demand is raised by respiratory epidemics and other illness. Such demand could be expected to be high at Christmas with the onset of winter. Separate analyses were made for all\u2010causes, respiratory disease, and ischaemic heart disease, and also for elective and emergency admissions to National Health Service hospitals in South\u2010east England.",

We therefore looked first for any net increases in mean daily deaths during and for 2 days after weekends, which could be attributed to cutbacks in admissions at weekends.",

Low temperature then can be expected to increase illness and mortality (Bull & Morton 1975; Eurowinter Group 1997; Donaldson & Keatinge 1997). Respiratory infections by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are high at that time (http://www.phls.co.uk/topicsaz/index.htm). Haemoconcentration resulting from cold stress (Keatinge et al. 1984; Neild et al. 1994), and increased blood fibrinogen resulting from respiratory infections (Woodhouse et al. 1994), both tend to increase ischaemic heart deaths. Mortality was rising linearly before Christmas, and the rate of rise was analysed for any abrupt change that would give evidence of a specific effect of reduced admissions on Christmas Day.",

Even emergency admissions for respiratory disease were sharply reduced on Christmas Day and respiratory deaths then increased above trend on the next and subsequent days. This increase was too rapid in its early stages to be attributable to spread of infection at Christmas Day gatherings. Pulmonary symptoms resulting from infection by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses only start 3 days, and symptoms of influenza 2\u20134 days, after infection (Tyrrell et al. 1993; Isaacs 1996). The cutback in hospital admissions, and probably in other medical services, on Christmas Day provides the most likely explanation for the acceleration of deaths immediately afterwards.",

The cutbacks in admissions at weekends were apparently successfully confined to patients without such pressing need for treatment. We know of no estimate of the overall proportion of admissions made up of such patients, although 1\u201320% of admissions to British hospitals have been judged inappropriate to the nature and severity of the patient's illness and the facilities of the hospital, and therefore unlikely to benefit the patient, rapidly or otherwise (Anderson et al. 1988; Victor & Khakoo 1994; Smith et al. 1997; McDonough et al. 2000). The selective admission of seriously ill people at weekends can incidentally explain high hospital mortality reported among people admitted at weekends (Bell & Redelmeier 2002), without needing to attribute that mortality to deficiencies in hospital treatment at weekends.",

The cutbacks in hospital admissions at that time may be partly because of patients\u2019 choice, although it seems unlikely that many people acutely ill with respiratory infections would refuse admission in order to spend Christmas at home. Action to reduce cold stress, particularly outdoors, could reduce both the respiratory and other illness in cold weather (Keatinge 1987; Eurowinter Group 1997). Immunization against respiratory syncytial virus, in addition to current immunization against influenza (Treanor & Falsey 1999), may also have scope to do so. However, the main implication of the present results is that any major respiratory epidemic is likely to require a large number of admissions to beds with facilities for managing respiratory failure, if unnecessary deaths are to be avoided. Current epidemics of respiratory infections are minor compared to the influenza epidemics of 1970s, but the recent appearances of the Fuji strain of influenza, and of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have raised the possibility that a new virus may produce another large epidemic of respiratory disease before natural or artificial immunity to it can be established.",
