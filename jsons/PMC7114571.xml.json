            "text": "Children, especially children aged three years and under, have a high frequency of infectious disease episodes.1 Children in daycare nurseries have more infections than children cared for elsewhere,2, 3, 4 mainly because of direct transmission between children, contact or respiratory droplet transmission, and inadequate hand hygiene. Although indirect transmission of infection via the nursery environment has not been studied extensively, it is likely to play a role. Previous research on bacteria in the nursery environment has shown positive cultures in 10\u201360% of samples, depending on location, but almost all bacteria isolated were of low pathogenicity.5, 6, 7 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the diversity of bacteria in the nurseries has shown that the most common bacteria in the nursery environment are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas-like bacteria, all of which rarely cause disease in healthy children.8 Less is known about viruses in the nursery environment in spite of the frequency of viral respiratory infections caused by rhinovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 In a study of the prevalence of 16 different respiratory viruses on surfaces in 23 nurseries during the winter of 2010\u20132011, using the same technique as in this study, respiratory viruses were found to be widespread in the environment, especially on toys (publication pending). This study found that toys were not washed or disinfected systematically. The Danish Health Board recommends monthly cleaning,15 but it is not known whether regular cleaning of toys in nurseries can affect the pathogen load and reduce infection.",

            "text": "Sampling was performed before and after the intervention in December 2012 and April 2013. Ten predefined sampling points (seven in the playroom and three in the toilet area) were sampled in each of the 12 nurseries. The playroom sampling points were undersides of tables, plastic toys, wooden toys, food toys, teddy bears, pillows and sofas. The toilet sampling points were toilet seats, changing mats and basin taps. The sampling area for most sampling points was 10 \u00d7 10 cm, but where it was not possible to sample a 10 \u00d7 10 cm square (e.g. on smaller toys), the whole object was swabbed. Sampling was performed using: (1) a dry, sterile, cotton-tipped swab, immersed in ox serum broth after sampling (Department of Clinical Microbiology, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark); and (2) a double-sided dipslide (25 \u00d7 80 mm) with tryptic soy agar (TSA) agar on one side and violet red bile glucose agar on the other side, with both sides containing a neutralizer against disinfectants (Model No. DPSLDTV, 3M, Copenhagen, Denmark). The dipslides were incubated for 48 h and the ox serum broth was incubated for seven days at 35\u201337\u00b0C. Following incubation, the ox serum broth was plated on to a blood agar plate (Item No. 677, SSI\n-Diagnostika, Copenhagen, Denmark) and a lactose agar plate (Item No. 694, SSI) and incubated for 24 h. Total bacteria count was determined using the TSA side of the dipslide and the supplied key from the manufacturer, and reported as colony-forming units (cfu)/cm2. The different species from both dipslides and the ox serum broth were identified using conventional identification and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) (Bruker Daltonics Scandinavia AB, Frederikssund, Denmark). MALDI-TOF was only used for potential pathogens (all faecal bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and nasopharyngeal bacteria). Bacteria (and fungi) were divided into four groups: skin bacteria (CoNS, Micrococcus spp., Poprionibacterium spp. and S. aureus), water and soil bacteria and fungi (Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas-like spp., Aeromonas spp., Comamonas spp., Bacillus spp. and moulds), nasopharyngeal bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella spp. and non-haemolytic streptococci) and intestinal bacteria (all Enterobactereaceae and Enterococcus spp.). Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were used as indicators of faecal contamination.",

After sampling, each swab was placed in a 15-ml sterile plastic container with 5 ml Nuclisens Lysis buffer (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). On arrival at the laboratory, the tubes were placed on a shaking table for 20 min and the lysis buffer was transferred to a 3.6-ml cryotube and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis.

This is in accordance with a study by Lee et al., who investigated the bacterial diversity in a nursery through a combination of cultures and 16S rRNA sequencing.8 They found that the most prevalent bacteria cultured were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., while 16S sequencing analysis was dominated by Pseudomonas spp. and Oxalobacteria spp. The present study found a very low prevalence of potential pathogens (6%), and this was lower than reported in many other studies; for example, Laborde et al. reported faecal coliform rates of 20\u201350% on toys, sinks and tables in toddlers' classrooms;16 and Ekanem et al. reported a faecal coliform rate of 13% on classroom objects.17 The discrepancies may be due to different sampling techniques, different sampling points and different sampling areas. It may be more efficient to sample larger areas using cloths in order to maximize the chances of finding pathogenic bacteria present in the environment.",

Other studies have found similar pathogens in the throats of children with respiratory infections.9, 11, 18 These studies found rhinovirus, RSV, coronavirus and adenovirus to be the most prevalent viruses. This corresponds well with the present results, where bocavirus was the most prevalent virus, followed by coronavirus, adenovirus and rhinovirus. RSV detection was lower, but this may have been because the severity of RSV infection keeps children away from nurseries. The similarity between the present findings in the environment and findings in children's throats indicates that viruses are transmitted to the environment. The weakness of the PCR technique is that viral nucleic acid is detected rather than \u2018live\u2019 viruses, and the prevalence of infectious viruses may be overestimated. To assess this, the viruses would have to be grown in cell cultures. This was not possible due to time and economic constraints. Moreover, some viruses, such as norovirus, cannot be cultured.",

            "text": "The main endpoint in this study was the number of days of absence due to sickness. This study did not find a decrease in total sickness absence or in sickness absence due to respiratory infection. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to measure the isolated effect of cleaning toys on infectious diseases in nurseries. However, a few studies have \u2018touched upon\u2019 the subject. Krilov et al. showed a significant decrease in the number of infections in a specialized preschool following the implementation of an infection control programme.19 This programme included cleaning toys, but this was combined with other measures such as hand hygiene and environmental cleaning. Numerous studies have shown the presence of coliforms and different pathogenic bacteria and viruses on toys in hospitals and other clinical settings.20, 21, 22, 23 Consequently, the general recommendations to date have been that toys should be cleaned regularly in order to prevent infections. The data from this study, however, do not support these recommendations. Possible reasons for failure to observe an effect of cleaning toys include: too great an interval between washes; not washing all toys at the same time; and the effect of person-to-person transmission overshadowing the effect of cleaning. This raises the question of whether commercial cleaning of toys is cost-effective. It is likely that the most effective ways to prevent infections in daycare nurseries are rigorous hand hygiene and other well-established infection control measures, or simply to keep the children at home for longer when they are ill.24, 25, 26, 27, 28 The latter is confirmed by the absence timelines in this study (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), which included the period before and after the Christmas holiday in December. During this holiday, the nurseries were closed for two weeks. There was a marked decrease in sickness absence after the holiday in both groups, with the percentage of children with respiratory infection decreasing from 1.6% to 0.5% in the intervention group and from 1.1% to 0.4% in the control group. If feasible, absence from nurseries might be the best way to reduce the spread of infection in children.",
