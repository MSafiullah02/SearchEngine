Kessler, M.D., former FDA commissioner (Revelle, 1995) . Screening donated blood for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through blood transfusion is very important in ensuring safety. The United States has the safest blood supply in the world (Revelle, 1995) , and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is striving to keep it safe by decreasing the risk of infectious disease transmission. The regulatory agency is continuously updating its requirements and standards for collecting and processing blood. An important step in ensuring safety is the screening of donated blood for infectious diseases. In the United States, tests for infectious diseases are routinely conducted on each unit of donated blood, and these tests are designed to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 21 .1). The field of clinical microbiology and virology is now moving into the focus of molecular technology. Currently, nucleic acid testing techniques have been developed to screen blood and plasma products for evidence of very recent viral infections that could be missed by conventional serologic tests. It is time for all blood safety staffs to use molecular detection techniques. This approach can significantly aid in blood safety to reduce the risk of transmission of serious disease by transfusion. This chapter will review the current antigen/antibody-based technology, molecular biological technology, and published regulatory policy data for blood safety.",

For indirect virus detection by virus specific antibodies [e.g., an immunofluorescence assay or enzyme immunoassay (EIA), etc.], there is a problem in that shortly after infection by a pathogenic virus, there is a window period in which antibody generation is insufficient for detection (Chamberland, 2001) .

The nucleic acid tests can also provide evidence for genetic variation in viruses. Molecular methods include the use of nucleic acid probes as well as amplification based and DNA sequence-based techniques. More and more molecular diagnostic methods are now available commercially. In comparison to classical methods, molecular biological methods are superior in terms of rapidness, specificity, and sensitivity. The current nucleic acid detection methods in the field may be grouped into two major classes: amplifying techniques such as PCR and nonamplifying techniques such as Southern blot hybridization. Amplifying techniques are more sensitive than nonamplifying techniques. There are two different amplifying methods (Hayden, 2005) , target amplification methods and signal amplification methods. Target amplifying techniques include PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (Guichon et al., 2004 , Starkey et al., 2004 , self-sustaining sequence amplification (3SR), transcription-based amplification (TAS), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), and ligase chain reaction (LCR). Signal amplification methods include branched DNA signal amplification (bDNA) (Peter and Sevall, 2004) , cleavage-based signal amplification (cycling probe technologies and invader assay), Q\u00df replicase, hybrid capture, cycling probe technologies (CPT), and rolling-circle amplification (RCA) (Tang et al., 1997) .

This technique is used to detect specific sequences within mixturesof DNA, which is size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis andthen transferred by capillary action to a suitable membrane. After blocking of nonspecificbinding sites, the nitrocellulose replica of the original gel electrophoresis experiment is then allowed to hybridize with an oligonucleotide probe representing the specific DNA sequence of interest. Should specific DNA be present on the blot, it will combine with the labeled probe and be detectable. By co-electrophoresing DNA fragments of known molecular weight, the size(s) of the hybridizing band(s) can then be determined. Southern blotting hybridization technology is one of the major tools that have already helped clinical staffs worldwide interpret genomic information. Other competing methodologies include in situ hybridization and solution hybridization. Important clinical examples of the use of this technology are DNA fingerprinting and the ability to detect DNA gene rearrangements.",

There is not any technique that has had a greater impact on the practice of molecular biology than PCR. With this technique, we can detect infectious disease agents at an extremely low level. It is based on the ability of sense and anti-sense DNA primers to hybridize to a DNA of interest. After extension from the primers on the DNA template by DNA polymerase, the reaction is heatdenatured and allowed to anneal with the primers once again. Another round of extension leads to a multiplicative increase in DNA products. Therefore, a minute amount of DNA can be efficiently amplified in an exponential fashion to result in easily manipulable amounts of DNA. By including critical controls, the technique can be made quantitative. The current level of the sensitivity and detection limit is as low as 10-50 copies per mL in HIV testing (Ginocchio et al., 2003) . Important clinical examples of the use of PCR are detection of HIV and HCV (Abbott, 2003; Roche, 2003; Katsoulidou, 2004) . PCR techniques have evolved into different branches. Some of them are now widely in use for virus detection in clinical diagnostics. These are real-time PCR by Taqman (Roche), Light Cycler (Roche), and Smart Cycler (Cepheid), and in situ PCR, nested-PCR, broad-range PCR, multiplex PCR, RT-PCR, arbitrarily primer PCR, long PCR, and quantitative PCR. Real-time sequence technology will be coming soon for more detailed detection.",

Chronic infection results in a high risk for liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver, which cause about 1,000,000 deaths each year. Each year up to 200,000 people become newly infected in the United States alone. Since screening for HBV began in 1969, the rate of infection through blood transfusions has greatly decreased. However, as of 2000, HBV is still transmitted through blood transfusions in 1 out of 137,000 units of blood. One reason for this is that currently available blood screening technologies detect core antibodies or surface antigens, which appear up to 8 weeks after infection.

Fortunately, most patients recover completely and test negative for HBsAg within a few months after the illness. A small percentage of people become chronic carriers of the virus, and in these cases, the test may remain positive for years. Chronically infected people can develop severe liver disease as time passes and need to be followed carefully by an experienced doctor. To reduce the occurrence of post-transfusion hepatitis, it is essential to screen all blood donations for hepatitis B surface antigen by the most sensitive and specific assays. Blood donations that are found to be reactive in the HBsAg test are automatically confirmed by the HBsAg confirmatory assay. If the specimen is neutralizable in the confirmatory test, the specimen is considered positive for HBsAg. Hepatitis B surface antigen testing of donated blood was begun in 1975 (Table 21.1) .",

There are some commercially available test methods for detecting HBV DNA in the market now, such as Chiron's Quantiplex HBV DNA (Krajden et al., 1998) , Digene's Hybrid Capture, Abbott's HBV DNA assay, and Roche's Amplicor HBV Monitor. Using these commercial hybridization or PCR-based assays, HBV DNA can be detected 1 to 3 weeks before the appearance of HBsAg (Hollinger and Jake, 2001) . All HBsAg positive patients (blood donors) have detectable HBV DNA in their serum. Some chronically infected patients who have lost their HBsAg remain HBV DNA positive but are disqualified as potential blood donors. Molecular detection of HBV DNA is more sensitive than current methods employed for HBsAg screening.",

If an individual has a positive anti-HBc test, but the HBsAg test is negative, it may mean that the person once had hepatitis B but has recovered from the infection. Of the individuals with a positive test for anti-HBc, many have not been exposed to the hepatitis B virus; thus, there is a frequent problem of false positives.

Hepatitis caused by HCV is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. Over 4 million Americans are believed to be infected. HCV can also be transmitted through blood transfusion. HCV causes inflammation of the liver, and up to 80% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection, which can lead to liver inflammation, cirrhosis, cancer, and death. Eventually, up to 20% of people with HCV may develop cirrhosis of the liver or other severe liver diseases. As in other forms of hepatitis, individuals may be infected with the virus but may not realize they are carriers because they do not have any symptoms. Because of the risk of serious illness, people with HCV need to be followed closely by a physician with experience evaluating this infection. Since the full length HCV cDNA was first cloned in 1989, significant progress has been made in characterizing its molecular biology (Lamballerie, 1996) . But, the natural history of HCV infection is still largely unclear and current treatment options for patients are limited. There is no vaccine for HCV, and the only available treatment, a combination of alphainterferon and ribavirin, is efficacious in only a minority of patients (Wang and Heinz, 2001) . The life cycle of the HCV is poorly understood due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system (Cohen, 1999) . There is an urgent need to develop a highly sensitive detection method for studying possible extrahepatic sites for the replication of hepatitis C virus. We recently established a cell culture system for the replication of HCV by using human T and B leukemia cell lines. (Hu et al., 2003) This model should represent a valuable tool for the detailed study of the initial steps of the HCV replication cycle and for the evaluation of antiviral molecules. Currently, appropriate therapeutic and vaccine strategies for HCV have not been developed. Early detection and prevention of HCV infection are most important for blood safety.",

High-sensitivity detection of HCV during the window period is a long-term technical challenge in the field. Tests for HCV RNA genome detection based on the PCR or other highly sensitive RNA detection systems have been used for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis (Major et al., 2001) . Sensitive detection of HCV RNA based on RT-PCR or other nucleic acid amplification techniques can be readily accomplished with kits that are now available commercially. For example, in 1999 the FDA approved Roche's Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Ultra Sensitive quantitative assay. It can measure HIV levels at as few as 50 copies/mL and another commercial kit, the LCx HIV RNA Quantitative Assay from Abbott Laboratories, also has a detection limit at 50 copies/mL. Some research papers even showed a sensitivity limit at 1 copy (Palmer et al., 2003) . In fact, a qualitative assay should be much more sensitive than a quantitative assay for HIV/HCV screening. A sensitive qualitative HCV molecular detection assay will possibly interdict and virtually prevent all transfusion-associated HIV/HCV. The current sensitivity standard for clinical diagnostics is 100 copies per mL, but since there has been an improvement in technology, this would be the time to change sensitivity standard to 50 copies per mL.",

The test is designed to detect antibodies directed against antigens of the HIV-1 or HIV-2 viruses. HIV-1 is much more common in the United States, whereas HIV-2 is prevalent in Western Africa. Donors are tested for both viruses because both are transmitted by infected blood, and a few cases of HIV-2 have been identified in U.S. residents. In 1985, the first blood-screening EIA test to detect HIV was licensed and quickly implemented by blood banks to protect the blood supply. And, in 1992, testing of donor blood for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies (anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2) was implemented. In 1996, HIV p24 antigen testing of donated blood was mandated although the test does not completely close the HIV window. Now, the p24 antigen testing is going to be compared with a PCR-based test for their ability to detect HIV in the window period. (Anti-HTLV-I, -II) HTLV retroviruses are endemic in Japan and the Caribbean but relatively uncommon in the United States. They cause adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a neurological disorder similar to multiple sclerosis. The infection can persist for a lifetime but rarely causes major illnesses in most people who are infected. In rare instances, the virus may, after many years of infection, cause nervous system disease or an unusual type of leukemia. HTLV-II infections are usually associated with intravenous drug usage, especially among people who share needles or syringes. Disease associations with HTLV-II have been hard to confirm, but the virus may cause subtle abnormalities of immunity that lead to frequent infections, or rare cases of neurological disease.",

The virus can infect people, horses, many types of birds, and some other animals. WNV was shown in 2002 to be transmissible by blood (Biggerstaff and Peterson, 2003) , with an estimated mean risk of 2/10,000 to 5/10,000 in outbreak regions in the United States. The most common symptoms of transfusion-transmitted cases of WNV were fever and headache. Detection of WNV includes either a measurement of WNV antibodies or of WNV nucleic acid (detecting genetic material from the virus itself). There are two types of WNV antibody testing: IgM and IgG. In most individuals, IgM antibodies will be present within 8 days after the initial exposure to WNV, followed by IgG production several weeks later. But, the antibodies tested to detect WNV are not expedient for donor blood screening. Nucleic acid testing involves amplifying and measuring the West Nile virus's genetic material to detect the presence of the virus in blood or tissue. WNV NAT will be negative in the blood once clinical illness has occurred. In this situation, both NAT and IgM antibody testing may be needed. Nucleic acid tests to screen blood for WNV are commercially available and in current use. But, the viral yield for WNV infection is much lower than other viruses. Consequently, a more sensitive WNV NAT system for donor blood screening will be required, which could further reduce the risks of transfusion transmitted WNV.",

Blood centers began testing for this shortly after World War II, when syphilis rates in the general population were much higher.

Sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests vary depending on the type of test performed and the stage of the disease. If the donor has spirochetemia, their serologic tests are usually negative, and if the donors are antibody positive, their blood is not infectious.

The most effective way of screening donors is to take a proper history of malaria or of fever that could be due to malaria. Donor selection criteria should be designed to exclude potentially infectious individuals from donating red blood cells for transfusion. Because there are no practical laboratory tests available to test donor blood, donors traveling to high-risk malaria areas are excluded from donating blood for 6 months. However, there is a need to develop suitable screening tests, especially for use in an endemic area. A number of clinical research approaches have been developed for the extraction, amplification, and detection of malaria parasite DNA from blood products (Pass, 2001) .",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus is a newly recognized coronavirus whose genome sequence does not belong to any of the known coronavirus groups and which quickly spread all over the world from Asia in 2003. There has been no evidence that this infection is transmitted from blood donors to transfusion recipients, but the virus associated with SARS is present in the blood of people who are sick, and it is possible that the virus could be present in blood immediately before a person gets sick, so that an individual with infection but no symptoms possibly could transmit SARS through a blood donation. To help determine whether or not an individual might be infected with SARS, a blood collection facility will ask a potential donor orally or in writing about any travel to a SARS-affected country or a history of SARS or possible exposure to SARS. Enzyme-linked immunoassays for detection of specific IgG and IgM antibodies and RT-PCR for detection of SARS coronavirus-specific RNA in SARS patients has been developed. Rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of SARS and other novel coronaviruses by molecular methods will be very important in the future.",

It is still possible that unexplained cases of post-transfusion hepatitis may be caused by a new, undiscovered pathogen. In recent years, numerous new infectious agents found worldwide have been identified through time-consuming procedures. By the time a new virus, such as HCV, HIV, and SARS, is found, many people are infected and there could be a large number of fatalities. There is an urgent need to develop methods for rapid identification and characterization of previously unknown pathogenic viruses. The most recent technologies for detecting and identifying previously unrecognized pathogens are expression library screening, representational difference analysis, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction. But they are all time-consuming approaches. The new unrecognized and uncharacterized viral agents can be rapidly identified by some of the new molecular approaches, for example, subtraction hybridization (Hu and Hirshfield, 2005) and DNA microarray.",

The high safety level of the blood supply is the result of continued improvements in blood donor screening and testing. It will be achieved by introducing more updated nucleic acid tests to the field of blood safety. Nucleic acid testing is a method of testing blood that is more sensitive and specific than conventional tests that require the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. Also, NAT works by detecting the low levels of viral genetic material present when an infection occurs but before the body develops an immune response to a virus. This improved sensitivity should enable us to significantly decrease the infection window period, allowing for earlier detection of the infection and diminishing the chances for transmission of the agent via transfusion. We are not only to protect the blood supply from known pathogens but also the emergence of new and unrecognized and uncharacterized infectious agents. The NAT methods are more sensitive and specific compared with non-NAT. In the future, NAT technology, such as PCR, may allow routine screening of donors for all the known and unknown pathogens of concern to blood safety.",
