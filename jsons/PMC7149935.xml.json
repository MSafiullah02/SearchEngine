            "text": "The interaction of immune cells with pathogens, antigens, antibodies, cytokines, microbiota, and other assaults leads to changes in gene expression that culminate in appropriate cellular differentiation, proliferation, activation, tolerance, or cell death for an effective immune response. The gene expression program of each immune cell type is precisely controlled in a signal-, cell lineage-specific, and kinetically precise fashion to achieve this goal. A proportion of this specificity is dictated by defined signaling pathways that employ a set of transcription factors (TFs) that bind specific sequences in promoter-proximal and -distal DNA elements to activate gene transcription. However, epigenetic factors, namely, covalent modifications on DNA or histones, provide a critical link that enables or prevents access of these TFs to identical DNA sequences in different immune cell types. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications make the DNA accessible, or not, to the recruitment of transcriptional machinery, in a time-sensitive fashion, either rapidly after activation or in a delayed fashion [1]. Importantly, appropriate histone modifications also prevent unwanted expression of potent mediators [2] and enable context-specific repression or enhancement of secondary gene expression programs triggered by restimulation of immune cells [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Thus the particular cell-type exclusive combinations of DNA and histone modifications are critical for immune cells to collectively achieve their goal: an assault on pathogens, while usually avoiding deleterious inflammation to the host. Much of the epigenetic landscape of immune cells is set during cellular differentiation; however, importantly, environmental triggers also induce further changes in histone modifications in differentiated cells. Emerging evidence demonstrates that these new environment-triggered histone modifications in immune cells can be maintained for significant periods. A disruption of immune cell epigenetic regulation is thus predicted to be a major contributor to unrestrained immune responses and immune tolerance disruption that lead to diseases such as autoimmunity and inflammation. Furthermore, pathogen-induced epigenetics of immune cells may have implications for the design of vaccination strategies and could lead to improvement of vaccination efficacy [8].",

            "text": "Epigenetics is defined as heritable modifications of DNA/chromatin that does not include changes in the DNA sequence. In broader terms, however, epigenetics describes the mechanisms by which chromatin-associated proteins, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones, and covalent modifications of DNA regulate transcription. The \u201chistone code\u201d hypothesis [9], proposed by David Allis and colleagues, explains how single and/or combinatorial PTMs on histones define and regulate transcriptional states of DNA. According to the hypothesis, the histone code is as important to gene expression as the DNA sequence itself. The development of techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in recent years has enabled unprecedented advance in our understanding of the function of various histone modifications in general, and of the numerous enzymes that contribute to the establishment of histone modifications, as well as the assorted effector proteins that bind them. Whether histone modifications truly constitute a strict \u201ccode\u201d or not, it is clear that the elaborate combinations of PTMs on histones function to tightly regulate cell-type-specific gene transcription. It is arguable if histone modifications are truly \u201cepigenetic,\u201d as it is not yet understood how histone modifications are maintained through cell division or intergenerationally. Certainly in cells of the immune system, heritability of induced epigenetic modifications has yet to be demonstrated. However, functionally, pathogen-induced epigenetic modifications, particularly in cells of the innate immune system, can influence secondary responses to the same or different pathogens in the short term (1 week to 3 months) at least. This aspect will be discussed in further detail. Misexpression of many chromatin-modifying enzymes is increasingly being identified in multiple diseases, making proteins that \u201cwrite,\u201d \u201cerase,\u201d and \u201cread\u201d histone tail and DNA modifications the most promising and intently pursued targets in drug discovery today. We will discuss rapidly accumulating evidence of their potential as targets in immunologic disease, for enhanced responses to pathogens, and prevention of unwanted inflammation.",

            "text": "Epigenetic (\u201cepi\u201d = outside of or above) regulation of gene expression is a dynamic process that establishes precise cellular development and function in genetically identical cells. Such regulation is brought about by covalent modification of the DNA itself and of DNA-associated histone proteins. DNA modifications primarily are CpG cytosine-5 methylation [10] and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine [11], but hydroxylation, formylation, and carboxylation have also been observed [12]. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into the nucleus along with histone and nonhistone proteins, collectively called chromatin. The unit of chromatin is a nucleosome, which consists of 147 bp nucleotides wrapped around a histone octamer. The histone octamer contains two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Nucleosomes are packaged into progressively higher-order structures and ultimately give rise to chromosomes that are visible under a light microscope at metaphase. NH2-terminal tails of histone proteins protrude from the nucleosome, and are subject to covalent chemical modifications. Recent mass spectrometry analysis identified more than a dozen different types of PTMs on histone tails [13], the most studied of which are acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, citrullination, and ubiquitination [14]. With the exception of methylation, histone-tail modifications lead to a change in the net charge of the nucleosomes, loosening interactions between histones and DNA. This in turn affects the levels of chromatin compaction, creating condensed \u201cheterochromatic\u201d or more open \u201ceuchromatic\u201d regions, which are refractory or permissive, respectively, to binding of TFs. Thus histone modification leads to changes in chromatin compaction, affecting access of TFs to promoter and enhancer regions, thus affecting gene expression. What effect histone methylation has on gene expression largely depends on the position of the amino acid residues that are methylated and whether the residues are mono-, di-, or trimethylated. Methylation of histone 3, lysine 4 (H3K4), H3K36, and H3K79 are associated with areas of active transcription whereas methylation of H3K9, H3K27, or H4K20 are associated with transcriptional repression [10], [15].",

            "text": "The dynamic nature of chromatin modifications serves a key requirement of changeable gene expression patterns: while on the one hand, histone modifications can be stably maintained, they are amenable to a high turnover of varying modifications to keep up with changing developmental, metabolic, and environmental needs. This delicate task is accomplished by several proteins that have traditionally been divided into three main classes: \u201cwriters,\u201d which establish the epigenetic modifications [DNA and histone methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases (HATs), kinases, etc.], \u201cerasers,\u201d which remove these marks [demethylases, histone deacetylases (HDACs), phosphatases], and \u201creaders,\u201d which interpret the modifications by docking to them through defined protein domains such as bromodomains, chromodomains, and plant homeodomain (PHD) (Fig. 12.1\n; see Table 12.1\nfor examples of epigenetic enzymes). Some reader proteins have also been shown to be essential for the assembly of appropriate transcriptional machinery at sites of recognition, for example, gene promoter regions. In sum, histone modifications determine the accessibility of DNA to TF as well as serve as sites of recruitment of transcriptional machinery to specific loci. Several other nuclear processes such as nucleosome occupancy and positioning along DNA [16], incorporation of alternative nonallelic histone variants at promoter and enhancer regions [17], and expression and binding of noncoding RNAs such as long noncoding RNAs [18] also contribute substantially to epigenetic regulation of gene expression.",

            "text": "Various lysine residues along N-terminal histone tails can be modified to gain methylation (\u2013CH3). Histone lysine methylation is the one modification known so far that can either function to promote (eg, histone 3, lysine 4 (H3K4), H3K36, and H4K20) or repress (H3K9, H3K27) transcription [15], [19]. Enzymes that act as histone methyltransferases (\u201cwriters\u201d) and demethylases (\u201cerasers\u201d) collectively maintain a dynamic histone methyl landscape. H3K27 methylation has a key role in regulating transcriptional responses from innate immune cells. The histone H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3, shown to utilize the jumonji (jmj) catalytic domain, showed a rapid induction in response to proinflammatory stimuli [20]. JMJD3 is recruited to the transcription start sites of > 70% of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced genes [21], thus contributing both to removal of repressive H3K27 methylation and to transcriptional upregulation of LPS-inducible genes. Further, JMJD3 is essential for M2 macrophage polarization in response to helminth infection and chitin, although dispensable for M1 responses [22]. The histone methyltransferase (G9a) catalyzes methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me). H3K9 methylation is found at a subset of promoters of LPS-inducible genes such as IL12b and CCL22 but is rapidly lost following LPS stimulation [23]. Similarly, H3K9 dimethylation levels at type I interferon (IFN) and IFN stimulatory genes (ISGs) inversely correlate with the scope and amplitude of IFN and ISG expression. Professional IFN-producing dendritic cells have significantly lower levels of H3K9 dimethylation at these gene promoters compared to weak producers of IFN such as fibroblasts, cardiac myocytes, or neuroblastoma cells. Indeed, H3K9 methyltransferase G9a knockout fibroblasts show enhanced IFN production and improved ability to suppress virus [2]. The repressive effects of di- or trimethylation of H3K9 are achieved by several means: influencing DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation, occluding deposition of the \u201cactivating\u201d histone acetylation, and active recruitment transcriptional repressors of the HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) family [24]. Signal transduction via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other immune sensors affect permissive histones downstream, mainly H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at transcriptionally active promoter and H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) at regions of active transcription. At least two immune cell types show enrichment of activating histone marks in an LPS-inducible fashion. Dendritic cells stimulated with LPS upregulate H3K4me3 that is very stable for 2 h following stimulation with the exception of about 30 loci that are lowly expressed prestimulation and become strongly induced after stimulation [25]. Similarly, macrophages upregulate H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at the promoters and enhancers, respectively, of multiple genes following exposure to a range of stimuli, with the majority of acquired H3K4me3 returning to basal levels within a few hours [4], [26].",

            "text": "Histone acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification catalyzed by HATs that transfer the acetyl moiety of acetyl-CoA to lysine (K) residues. HDACs catalytically reverse this process. LPS-stimulated macrophages show increased histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac), an indicator of open chromatin at numerous sites across the genome. This induced histone acetylation at lysine 5, 8, and 12 (H4K5/8/12Ac) usually occurs at promoter regions of genes, within 1 h of stimulation, decreasing after 2 h [26]. In DCs, a dramatic H4K27 acetylation was reported over an LPS time course correlating with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding [25]. Histone acetylation is exclusively \u201cread\u201d by bromodomains. There are 46 bromodomain-containing proteins in the human genome. Bromodomains of individual proteins have defined affinities to specific locations of lysine acetylation and some have been shown to recruit distinct proteins to the chromatin [27]. Hence each subclass of bromodomain proteins likely has unique functions in regulating gene expression. Most work has focused on the role of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of bromodomain-containing proteins that consists of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and a testes-specific BRDT. BET proteins connect histone acetylation state to the transcriptional elongation machinery [1], [28]. For instance, BRD4 can recruit positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) through its C-terminal domain and removes the pausing complex negative elongation factor and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor, thus allowing transcriptional elongation [28], [29]. Brd4 can also coactivate transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB via specific binding to acetylated RelA [30]. Knockdown of BRD2, 3, or 4 proteins, however, results in reduced expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines in macrophages suggesting all three BET proteins control the transcription of inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages [26]. This is likely through the ability of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 to interact with the PAF1 (polymerase associated factor 1) complex, or other chromatin modifying proteins such as NSD3 or JMJD6 [31].",

However, the emerging picture is that the presence of variant histone proteins in chromatin confers novel structural and functional properties to the nucleosome. In the context of immune responses, IFN treatment has been shown to trigger robust H3.3 incorporation into activated genes, which remain even after cessation of transcription [17]. Interestingly, this deposition was dependent on the histone methyltransferase Wolf\u2013Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1) that interacts with HIRA, the H3.3-specific histone chaperone. Indeed, WHSC1 also interacted with BRD4 and P-TEFb, demonstrating that deposition of histone variants can facilitate transcriptional elongation [17].",

The Fitzgerald laboratory identified lncRNA-Cox2 as a highly inducible lncRNA in both macrophages and dendritic cells following microbial stimulation. LncRNA-Cox2 is essential for controlling basal levels of ISGs as well as for proinflammatory cytokine production following microbial challenge. LncRNA-Cox2 mediates its repressive functions on ISGs through interactions with hnRNP-A/B and A2/B1. Knockdown of lncRNA-Cox2 or hnRNP A/B or A2/B1 resulted in decreased levels of RNA Pol II recruitment to the promoter of Ccl5 in macrophages [18]. LncRNAs have also been shown to be upregulated in the context of viral infection and downstream IFN production. Approximately 500 lncRNAs were differentially expressed following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or influenza [33] and more than 200 lncRNAs were upregulated following treatment of human hepatocytes with type I IFN [34]. One lncRNA, lnRNA-CMPK2, was a potent negative regulator of ISGs and its knockdown resulted in reduction of hepatitis C virus replication [34]. LncRNAs have also been shown to be important to T-lymphocyte differentiation. Recently, a chromatin associated lincRNA, Linc-MAF-4, was shown to be specifically expressed in CD4+ TH1 cells [35]. The expression of Linc-MAC-4 inversely correlates with the TF MAF, expressed in TH2 cells. Linc-MAF-4 was shown to modulate expression of MAF-4 in trans by recruitment of chromatin modifiers LSD and EZH2. Indeed, downregulation of the Linc-MAF-4 was shown to skew CD4+  T-cell differentiation toward the TH2 phenotype [35].",

            "text": "The precise kinetics of innate immune cell gene transcription following pathogen assault is tightly regulated by changes in histone modifications and the action of chromatin remodeling complexes. ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes influence transcriptional status just like histone modification. This is accomplished by sliding of the nucleosomes, as well as by insertion and ejection of histone octamers. The remodeling complexes have been classified into four families: SWI/SNF, CHD (chromodomain and helicase-like domain), ISWI, and INO80 (including SWR1 or SRCAP in mammals). Macrophages are preprogrammed to enable expression of a defined set of primary response genes (PRGs) within minutes of cell activation [36], [37]. This is thought to be accomplished early in naive macrophages, likely during lineage commitment, by enrichment of activating histone tail modifications commonly found at the promoters of actively transcribed genes (eg, H3K4me3, H4Ac), and the presence of CpG islands that may be protected from the repressive DNA methylation and as well as high levels of RNA Pol II association [1], [26]. Thus these genes do not require extensive chromatin remodeling (eg, SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling) or de novo protein synthesis for their activation, since they are epigenetically primed for transcription, their chromatin state is permissive to swift access by relevant TFs. In a naive stage, PRGs are transcriptionally active at a low level, producing low levels of unspliced and unstable transcripts. Upon appropriate stimulation these genes recruit the positive elongation factor (P-TEFb) and switch to expression of mature, processed mRNAs [1]. In contrast, late primary response genes such as Ifnb1 and secondary response genes (SRGs) such as Il12b and Il6, which are only transcribed hours after cell stimulation, possess low-density CpG promoters, display low H3K4me3, H4Ac, and RNA Pol II occupancy in naive macrophages, and require the SWI/SNF complex for chromatin remodeling for transcription to take place [36], [37].",

However, the ability to remember and respond more vigorously to a second pathogen encounter has been described in organisms devoid of T and B cells. Indeed, plants and invertebrates do not possess an adaptive immune system, which first appeared during evolution at jawless or early-jawed vertebrates [38]. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the immune system of plants and invertebrates can be primed by previous infections to mount stronger recall responses upon pathogen rechallenge [39], [40]. Now, examples of innate immune antigen- and nonantigen-specific \u201cmemory\u201d in mammals are rapidly emerging [4], [5], [6], [7], [41]. Innate monocytes and neutrophils from mice infected with attenuated Listeria monocytogenes were capable of \u201cbystander\u201d killing of an unrelated pathogen (Leishmania major) upon secondary infection [42], [43]. However, such priming was orchestrated primarily by IFN\u03b3 and other inflammatory mediators produced by memory T cells [42], [44]. Certainly, other studies have now shown that memory T cells can trigger activation of innate immune cells following reinfection [45], [46]. Examples of innate immune boosting by means that are independent of adaptive immunity have also emerged. A combination of aerosolized TLR agonists could protect mice against bacterial pneumonia and influenza infection [47], [48]. Infection with Heligmosomoides polygyrus significantly inhibited type I diabetes (T1D) in nonobese diabetic mice through CD25- and IL-10-independent mechanisms [49]. In humans it was shown by the Netea laboratory that monocytes recovered from healthy volunteers that were vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), a widely used live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis, produced significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines following exposure to nonmycobacterial bacteria and fungi [7]. Importantly, this nonantigen-specific innate immune \u201ctraining\u201d was maintained up to 3 months post the initial vaccination. Further, such monocyte immune \u201ctraining\u201d was completely independent of T and B cells since severe combined immunodeficiency mice vaccinated 2 weeks prior with BCG survived significantly longer after a lethal inoculum of Candida albicans\n[7]. Moreover, Rag1-deficient mice were protected from a secondary challenge of C. albicans or LPS following priming with C. albicans. These findings suggest that \u201ctraining\u201d of innate immune cells in mammals could be cell intrinsic, or at the very least independent of the adaptive immune system.",

Until recently it was thought that cell-lineage and signal-specific gene expression programs are fundamentally predetermined during cellular differentiation. However, recent evidence demonstrated that terminally differentiated cells such as monocytes and macrophages can acquire additional histone modifications upon pathogen exposure that affect gene expression upon subsequent stimulation. TLR4 activation by LPS induces histone modifications that lead to altered and repressed gene expression upon secondary LPS stimulation [3], [50]. Many of these pathogen-induced epigenetic changes in macrophages, particularly monomethylation of lysine(K)-4 on histone 3 (H3K4me1) at enhancers persist despite washout of the stimulus and removal of the TFs responsible for the initial deposition. Moreover, H3K4me1 was associated with a faster and stronger induction of multiple genes upon nonspecific restimulation [4].",

            "text": "\nC. abicans-induced innate immune training was associated with changes in the activating H3K4me3 at certain gene promoters in peritoneal macrophages 7 days post initial infection. In addition, a methyltransferase inhibitor prevented this induced training [6]. A follow-up study by the same group showed that \u03b2-glucan, the cell wall component of C. albicans, could induce changes in H3K4me3 as well as H3K27ac in human monocytes 7 days after washout. Without a direct comparison to induced H3K4me3 or H3K27Ac after acute stimulation it remains difficult to interpret whether these are maintained epigenetic modifications or are just demonstrative of active transcription in these cells triggered by other mechanisms. Nonetheless, many genes with altered H3K4me3 or H3K27ac profiles 1 week after C. albicans exposure were involved in innate immune signaling, and a large proportion with enhanced H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac were associated with glycolysis [5], raising an interesting potential of a metabolic switch in innate immune training. Multiple epigenetic modifications have a well-established link to central metabolism, as histone-modifying enzymes require metabolites as substrates or cofactors: demethylases and TET proteins are Fe(II) and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dioxegenases, HDACs are NAD-dependent enzymes, and S-adenosylmethionine is required for function of DNA/histone methyltransferases. Therefore, these enzymes are likely sensitive to fluctuations in these metabolites [51]. Interplay between metabolism and epigenetics would allow the relative metabolic activity of the cell to feed back into transcriptional regulation in an effort to maintain homeostasis. In fact, it has been proposed that epigenetic processes may initially have been a means to transduce metabolic events into phenotypic results [52]. This is well documented in cancer cells that undergo a switch to anaerobic metabolism (the \u201cWarburg effect\u201d) and exhibit multiple epigenetic imbalances [51]. Interestingly, macrophages and other innate immune cells are frequently found in inflamed sites, which are characterized by low oxygen levels and therefore may also rely heavily on the relationship between metabolism and epigenetics for gene expression. Certainly, activation of TLRs, notably TLR4, leads to a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in immune cells [53]. Succinate, which is known to inhibit \u03b1-ketoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases such as histone and DNA demethylases, as well as prolyl hydroxylases [52], is elevated in inflammation and sustains IL-1\u03b2 production through HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization [54]. Also differentiation of monocytes to macrophages results in a change in abundance of enzymes responsible for peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation pathway, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle [50]. \u03b2-Glucan-trained monocytes exhibited reduced oxygen consumption, enhanced glucose consumption, increased production of lactate and an increased NAD+/NADH ratio [5], which may be responsible for the observed alterations in H3K4me3, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me1 in these cells [5], [50].",

Cells of the innate immune system have been generally thought to be short lived. However, tissue macrophages have been shown to live for months if not years, particularly at sites of inflammation or tumors [55], but if they proliferate remains unclear. If demonstrated to be long lived, it is to be expected that trained immunity through epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms will have important consequences for the design of vaccination strategies.

Interestingly, L. monocytogenes secretory protein LntA directly interacts with the chromatin repressor BAHD1, probably dislodging BAHD1 from ISG promoters and causing subsequently upregulating some ISG [58], [59]. This seemingly counterintuitive strategy is proposed to be a mechanism used by the pathogen to fine tune host IFN I and II response to infection. Constitutive LntA expression leads to faster bacterial clearance, and BAHD1 deletion heterozygous mice are more resistant to infection compared to wild-type siblings [59].",

            "text": "Several bacterial pathogens despite lacking histones or higher-order chromatin structures produce histone-modifying proteins. For instance, the SET domain-containing protein RomA, required for pathogenesis of Legionella pneumonia, localizes to several gene promoters including innate immune gene promoters and catalyzes a previously unreported H3K14 methylation genomewide, leading to global gene repression [75]. BaSET, of Bacillus anthracis, is required for virulence and methylates lysine residues on H1, leading to repression of various NF-\u03baB target gene promoters [64], [70]. The Ankyrin-repeat (Ank)-containing proteins are yet another class of eukaryotic protein mimics found in intracellular pathogens of the Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Ricketssia, Orientia, Coxiella, and Legionella species. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, a tick-transmitted pathogen causing human granulocytic anaplasmosis, propagates within the primary antimicrobial defense cells, the neutrophils. A. phagocytophilum infection leads to a decrease in H3 acetylation at a subset of defense gene promoters and an overall increase in expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Consistent with this, treatment with HDAC1 inhibitors severely restricts the bacterium\u2019s ability to survive in the host, suggesting that the pathogen may survive the harsh environment of the host cell by HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and suppression of host defense genes [75]. It has been\nsuggested that an Ank-containing bacterial secretory protein that binds AT-rich chromatin regions is responsible for HDAC recruitment to relevant gene promoters in the host [68], [77]\n",

These NS1\u2013histone-like tails associate with the PAF1 (polymerase-associated factor 1) transcriptional elongation complex as well as with the CHD1 chromatin-remodeling complexes of the host. Like histone H3 tails, the NS1 tails bind to the PAF1 complex unmodified or after lysine methylation, but not upon lysine acetylation.

A chronic autoimmune condition that can affect virtually any organ system, SLE is characterized by the production of autoantibodies targeted to a variety of nuclear antigens. Early studies in SLE demonstrated that CD4+ T cells treated with DNA methylation inhibitors convert to autoreactivity, and the introduction of synthetically demethylated CD4+ T cells into mouse models resulted in a lupus-like syndrome [80]. Subsequently, several studies have highlighted the importance of DNA methylation in SLE etiology. SLE is characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation phenotype, particularly in CD4+ T cells and B cells, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, a reduction in expression of the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, is observed in SLE patients compared to healthy controls, leading to overexpression of many genes [81], [82]. Expression levels of IL-6 are correlated with disease severity in SLE, and the promoter region of IL-6 was found to be hypomethylated in SLE B cells [83]. Monozygotic twins are an ideal model to study epigenetic influences that contribute to autoimmune processes. One recent study compared DNA methylation genomewide in a cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for SLE, RA, and dermatomyositis [84]. Monozygotic twins discordant for SLE manifested DNA methylation and expression changes in genes relevant to SLE pathogenesis and a global decrease in the methylation content [84].",

The clinical onset of RA requires a combination of genetic susceptibility factors, deregulated immunomodulation as well as environmental influences.

Certainly, an altered DNA methylome signature in synovial fibroblasts derived from RA and osteoarthritis patients, in PBMC from RA patients and healthy controls, as well as reduced amounts of 5-mC in synovial tissues of RA patients, have been described by various research groups. Hypomethylated genes cluster in key pathways related to cell migration including focal adhesion, cell adhesion, transendothelial migration, and extracellular matrix interactions (reviewed in [92]). DNA hypomethylation and derepression of L1 retrotransposons has also been observed in these cells [82]. Moreover, the promoter region of the death receptor gene DR3 is hypermethylated in RA synovial cells, resulting in a reduced expression of DR3 protein and resistance to apoptosis [93]. Interestingly, normal fibroblasts treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-CdR acquired a hypomethylated and activated phenotype [82]. In RA monocytes, unmethylated CpG islands within the IL-6 promoter region have been associated with a local hyperactivation of the inflammation circuit [94]. Finally, hypermethylation of the promoter region of Foxp3, a TF key to the generation of Tregs, has also been reported in RA, systemic sclerosis, and T1D [95], [96].\n",

Moreover, the disease incidence has been increasing over the past decades, as demonstrated by data from Finland, where T1D yearly incidence has increased from 12 to 63 per 100,000 [103]. Studies of epigenetic alterations in T1D, however, are limited. Monozygotic twins discordant for T1D varied at >100 loci in DNA methylation [104]. Additionally, a significant increase in H3K9me2 in several high-risk T1D genes including CTLA4 was observed in peripheral lymphocytes and monocytes from T1D patients, compared to normal subjects [105]. T1D is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and differentiation of subtype T helper cells is governed by epigenetic factors [106]. Increased body weight and insulin resistance may be associated with T1D in adults. In addition, methyl donors (methionine, choline) and cofactors (vitamin B12, folic acid, and pyridoxal phosphate) that are essential for DNA methylation are dietary derived. Hence it is conceivable that epigenetic mechanisms associated with changes in nutrition might also contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D. In support of this hypothesis, hyperglycemia was observed to affect histone methylation [107].",

Studies in monozygotic twins minimize the confounding effects of genetic heterogeneity in disease etiology and have implicated epigenetic discordance between disease affected and nonaffected twins in inflammation in diseases like T1D [110], SLE [84], and asthma [111]. Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chromatin-interacting proteins as significant susceptibility loci for inflammatory diseases: variants in histone reader proteins are associated with incidence of Crohn\u2019s disease and MS [112], [113], variants within the DNA methylation writer DNMT3A with Crohn\u2019s disease [112], and the histone demethylase JARID1A (KDM5A) with ankylosing spondylitis [114]. Three SNPs in the BRD2 locus were found to be associated with a subset of RA patients positive for citrullinated \u03b1enolase peptide 1 and cyclic citrullinated peptides, independently of the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles [115]. In addition, an SNP in the locus of another epigenetic reader protein, namely, BRD1 (BRPF2), was shown to be protective in joint damage progression in stage I of a genomewide association study (GWAS) in ACPA+ RA patients [116].",

Patients with APECED carry autoantibodies in their serum, develop multiorgan autoimmunity, and display variable symptoms, such as premature gonadal failure, hypothyroidism, enamel hypoplasia, pernicious anemia, T1D, autoimmune hepatitis and gastritis, alopecia, keratitis, and vitiligo. AIRE is a central regulator of negative selection of self-reactive T cells in the thymus. Primarily a transcriptional activator, AIRE induces variable ectopic gene expression in subsets of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), resulting in promiscuous expression of normally tissue-restricted genes in the thymus. mTECS then present these proteins as self-antigens inducing clonal deletion by apoptosis of self-reactive thymocytes, leading to elimination of T cells that would otherwise target the self. AIRE, highly expressed in mTECs, is critical for this development of self-tolerance: AIRE-deficient mice display impaired clonal deletion of self-reactive thymocytes leading to the production of autoantibodies and lymphocytic infiltrates in peripheral tissues [117]. AIRE comprises various protein domains (caspase-recruitment domain, CARD [15], a nuclear localization signal [16]), a SAND (for Sp100, AIRE, nuclear phosphoprotein 41/75 or NucP41/75, and deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 or Deaf1), and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers [18]. CARD domain is shown to be critical for AIRE homooligomerization and speckled nuclear localization, the PHD of AIRE functions as an epigenetic reader, specifically recognizing unmethylated lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me0) [118]. The first plant homeodomain (PHD1) is shown to be absolutely critical for AIRE\u2019s transcription\u2013transactivation activity, as well as for its capacity to prevent multiorgan autoimmunity in transgenic mouse models. Recently, multiple cases and families with monoallelic mutations in the PHD1 zinc finger of AIRE that followed dominant inheritance were identified, typically characterized by later onset, milder phenotypes, and reduced penetrance compared to classical APS-1 [119]. Individuals with biallelic disease-causing AIRE mutations developed classic early-onset APS-1 phenotypes, whereas those carrying one of three different monoallelic mutations in the PHD1 finger (p.C311Y, p.V301M, and p.C302Y) segregated with clear but varying autoimmune phenotypes, ranging from late-onset classical APS-1 to APS-2 and isolated organ-specific autoimmunity (eg, vitiligo, PA, and APS-1-specific autoantibodies) [119].",

These studies suggest that modulating the \u201ceraser\u201d of these suppressive modifications, JMJD3 demethylase, by small molecules may be one way to curtail inflammation. However, this possibility is complicated by the fact that regulation of proinflammatory genes by JMJD3 may be independent of its demethylase activity [21]\n. Also the degree of sequence similarity among the JmjC domains of histone demethylases made it unclear if small molecule inhibitors could exhibit adequate substrate specificity. GlaxoSmithKline answered this challenge by identifying a highly selective inhibitor (GSK-J1 and a cell-permeable GSK-J4) of a lysine-specific demethylase UTX and JMJD3 that acted as an \u03b1-ketoglutarate mimic [139]. GSK-J4 prevented demethylation of the repressive H3K27me3 and reduced RNA Pol II recruitment, which prevented transcription of TNF and other inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated human monocytes [139]. Interestingly, a single knockdown of either UTX or JMJD3 did not reduce TNF, suggesting that these demethylases act together in the control of cytokine transcription.\n",

Some recent and elegant single-cell analyses revealed that histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation at a gene locus alters downstream transcription kinetics by as much as 50%, affecting two temporally distinct events. First, acetylation enhances the search kinetics of transcriptional activators, and later the acetylation accelerates the transition of Pol II from initiation to elongation [140]. In mammals, HDACs are divided into three classes on the basis of their cellular localization and tissue distribution. Class I HDACs are ubiquitously expressed and are predominantly nuclear. Class II HDACs are both nuclear and cytoplasmic and only expressed in certain tissues. Class III HDACs, also called sirtuins (SIRT1\u20137), are NAD+-dependent enzymes.",

            "text": "Although successfully used for the treatment of cancer, research now suggests that targeting certain HDACs (\u201cerasers\u201d) could be utilized for treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, RA, inflammatory bowel diseases, and some virus infections. Indeed, various class I as well as class II HDAC targeting inhibitors like trichostatin A (TSA), vorinostat (suberanilohydroxamic acid, SAHA), phenylbutyrate, and givinostat have shown antiinflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Table 12.3) [121], [122], [124], [141]. Recently, it was shown that butyrate exposure of mouse colonic lamina propria macrophages leads to an increase in expression of proinflammatory mediators NO, IL-6, and IL-12 but not of TNF, and an increase in H3K9Ac levels at the promoter regions of these genes in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages [142]. In contrast to the previously described pan-inhibitors of HDACs, specific class and isoform HDAC inhibitors have been identified for HDAC1 and HDAC3, and show antiinflammatory effects in animal models of inflammatory diseases and in PBMCs [121] from RA patients [92], respectively (Table 12.3). Further studies using new and even more potent HDAC inhibitors showed that largazole (LAR), a marine-derived class I HDAC inhibitor, suppressed the TNF\u03b1induced expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in RA synovial fibroblasts, whereas the TNF\u03b1induced MMP2 activity was reduced. Furthermore, the authors showed that LAR modulated expression levels of HDAC1, HDAC5, and HDAC6 and indicated a role of HDAC6 in the LAR-induced changes of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression levels [143]. Despite the reasonable success of HDACs as antiinflammatory agents, their exact mode of epigenetic regulation as antiinflammatory agents in vivo is unclear; the elucidation of which is only further confounded by the fact that most HDACs act on both histone or nonhistone substrates, and that HDAC inhibition leads to both gene expression and suppression in a cell context-dependent manner (reviewed in [144]).",

Moreover, targeting epigenetic \u201creaders\u201d seemed an appealing way to specifically interrupt the interpretation of epigenetic modifications without altering the overall epigenetic landscape of the cell, which could conceivably occur by targeting \u201cwriters\u201d or \u201cerasers.\u201d Bromodomain modules share a conserved fold that comprises a left-handed bundle of four \u03b1-helices that surround a central acetylated lysine-binding site. I-BET762 (also known as GSK525762A) and GSK525768A (which is the [R]-enantiomer of I-BET762) were identified initially through a screen for upregulation of APOA1. Upon subsequent chemoproteomics involving immobilization of the compounds on a matrix, followed by affinity purification of interacting proteins from cell extracts and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the interacting proteins were identified as BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4. I-BET762 acts as a histone mimic and competitively inhibits binding of BET proteins to acetylated histone peptides, and has a low affinity toward other bromodomain family members making it a specific inhibitor of the BET subfamily [26]. Treatment of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages with I-BET762 selectively inhibited activation of a subset of LPS-inducible cytokines, chemokines, and several TFs required for an inflammatory response [26]. LPS-inducible and I-BET-susceptible genes showed significantly reduced enrichment of the BET proteins BRD2, 3, and 4, P-TEFb, and Pol II demonstrating that I-BET762 successfully prevented assembly of chromatin activating and elongation promoting complexes for these promoters. The vast majority of genes that were suppressed by I-BET were late PRGs and SRGs with low CpG, low H4Ac, low H3K4me3, and low Pol II at their promoters in naive macrophages. PRGs or housekeeping genes with high CpG, high H3K4me3, and high H4Ac could not be inhibited with I-BET treatment, possibly because of the inability of I-BET, acting as a histone mimic, to outcompete the preexisting levels of acetylation at those loci. Importantly, I-BET administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.) also prevented LPS-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis in mice [26], highlighting its potential as an antiinflammatory agent. A second class of BET family bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET151, with improved pharmacokinetics [31] was also shown to reduce levels of circulating IL-6 and protected mice from LPS-induced death [133]. Independent studies using an alternative pan-BET inhibitor, JQ1, also observed suppression of proinflammatory cytokine induction, and rescued mice from LPS-induced death [26], [134]. Finally, in murine macrophages, MS436, a compound that preferentially targets the first bromodomain of BRD4, blocked the transcriptional activity of BRD4 in the NF-\u03baB-directed production of nitric oxide and IL-6 [126].",

            "text": "Genetic factors are unable to fully account for the risk and prognosis of immune diseases. Epigenetics provides an important link between genetic susceptibility and the environment in the development of immune-based diseases. Moreover, the field of epigenetics within immunology is rapidly emerging. Numerous studies now support the importance of epigenetics in the initiation and perpetuation of immune-based disorders. This is illustrated by recent discoveries of new classes of chromatin-modifying enzymes, greater insight into the function of some of these chromatin-associated proteins in immune cells, findings of mutations in genes coding for epigenetic machinery in immune-based disorders, and the development of highly potent and specific small molecule inhibitors to epigenetic enzymes that demonstrate potency in immune cells. Moreover, our idea of innate immunity is swiftly changing with the developing concept that the innate immune system may bear some \u201cmemory\u201d of previous pathogen encounters through maintenance of altered epigenetics. Pathogens that have been difficult to target through conventional vaccination strategies could benefit from \u201ctraining\u201d of the innate immune system via epigenetic manipulation. While it is still unclear whether epigenetic alterations in autoimmune diseases are a product of an abnormal immune response that leads to the disease, or whether such alterations are the result of the disease process itself. Epigenetic modifications could potentially find application as biomarkers and taking individual epigenetic variation into account will lead to better precision medicine for immune diseases in the future. Further, adjusting whole subsets of inflammatory genes, rather than individual inflammatory mediators through druggable epigenetic enzymes, would better serve the multitude of inflammatory disorders that currently lack effective therapies. Future understanding of the plethora of epigenetic modifiers, newly developed chemical probes, as well as the ongoing documentation of epigenetic landscapes in immune cells through such initiatives as the BLUEPRINT consortium (http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu), NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org), and the Structural Genomics Consortium (http://www.thesgc.org/epigenetics) will help to achieve this goal.",
