Given the broad scope of infectious diseases that affect men, we have selected several topics that are especially relevant to this patient population. These topics include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), sinusitis, otitis media and externa, influenza, viral hepatitis (A, B and C), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, infectious diarrheas, and sexually transmitted diseases. Our aim in this chapter is not to provide an exhaustive review of these topics, but primarily to present an up-to-date and evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment of these common illnesses for primary care physicians in caring for male patients.",

Further complicating the treatment of CAP is the emergence of antibiotic resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, perhaps the most common organism implicated.1 The rates of pneumonia are higher in men discharged from the hospital (4.1% in men versus 3.1% in women).2\n",

Dental infections of the upper teeth, particularly the second bicuspids and first and second molars, are responsible for 5\u201310% of cases of maxillary sinusitis. Environmental factors including high altitude, air pollution, and living in the Midwest or southern United States increase the risk of acute bacterial sinusitis.

These agents have been proved to be superior to placebo and are as effective as other agents that are more expensive, have a greater risk of adverse effects, and should be reserved for more serious infections that require treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime.11 For partial but incomplete resolution of symptoms after an initial course of antibiotics, the duration of initial therapy should be extended to complete a course for 21 days. In patients with moderate disease or in those with minimal to no improvement with initial therapy, high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate or levofloxacin should be used.11 In areas of the United States where there is a high level of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, resistance to macrolides and TMP/SMX will also be prevalent, and second-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefuroxime) should be used as initial therapy.7 More recently, high-dose short-course regimens (3\u20135 days) have been used to improve adherence and to decrease drug exposure.7 Clinical outcomes using these regimens compare favorably to more traditional 10\u201314-day regimens.13\nTable 11-5\nhighlights examples of both long- and short-course treatments.",

Unfortunately, these signs and symptoms are quite nonspecific and may be confused with other viral infections. Therefore, a high index of suspicion must be maintained and HIV testing must be performed if any risk factors are discovered after careful evaluation (Table 11-9\n).

Although traveler's diarrhea is usually self-limited, TMP-SMZ or a fluoroquinolone can reduce the duration of illness from 3\u20135 days to 1\u20132 days.45 Patients with fever and bloody diarrhea should be treated empirically with TMP-SMZ or a fluoroquinolone.45 These patients are most likely to have invasive disease with Shigella or Campylobacter species. Antimotility agents can be used for uncomplicated traveler's diarrhea but should be avoided in patients with fever and bloody diarrhea or those with fecal leukocytes.45 Treatment of EHEC 0157 with antimicrobial agents has been associated with an increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome and should therefore be considered carefully.

This lesion ulcerates within a few days, producing the classic painless chancre, which usually resolves in 3\u20136 weeks.\u2022\nSecondary syphilis: Weeks to months later, the majority of untreated patients will develop symptoms and signs of secondary syphilis including diffuse lymphadenopathy, focal alopecia, mucosal lesions, and condyloma lata. A classic rash, characterized as a symmetric red and papular eruption involving the entire trunk and extremities including the palms and soles where it can become squamous, is the most characteristic finding of secondary syphilis, occurring in approximately 90% of patients. Nonspecific symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, sore throat, myalgias, and weight loss.\u2022\nLatent syphilis: If untreated, clinical manifestations of secondary syphilis last for 2\u20136 weeks. Latent syphilis starts after the resolution of secondary syphilis and is defined by a positive serologic test result in an asymptomatic patient. Infection of less than 1 year is defined as early latent (infectious) and of more than 1 year as late latent (noninfectious).48\n\u2022\nTertiary syphilis: After a variable level of latency, tertiary syphilis develops in about one third of untreated patients presenting as gummatous (i.e., nodules found anywhere in the body, most often in the skin and bones), cardiovascular, or neurosyphilis manifestations.54\n\n",

Darkfield examinations and direct fluorescent antibody tests of lesion exudates or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis.48 Serologic tests for syphilis are classified into nontreponemal and treponemal assays. Nontreponemal tests include the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasma Reagin tests. Treponemal tests include the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed and T. pallidum particle agglutination tests. The use of only one type of serologic test is insufficient for diagnosis because false-positive nontreponemal test results may occur as a result of various medical conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases). The nontreponemal tests are recommended as screening tools, and the treponemal tests are required for confirmation. Nontreponemal tests usually correlate with disease activity and usually become nonreactive with time, which can provide a false-negative result if they are the sole test performed in a patient with a previous infection. Reactive treponemal tests usually remain reactive regardless of treatment or disease activity. Some HIV-infected patients can have atypical serologic tests results (unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating titers).48 Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VDRL results are diagnostic of neurosyphilis, if the specimen is not contaminated with blood. CSF leukocytosis and increased CSF protein levels are common in cases of neurosyphilis.",

Nineteen percent of men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States have been found to be seropositive for HPV-16.48 The most consistent risk factor for HPV acquisition is unprotected sexual activity and is directly related to the number of sexual partners a patient has had. In men, HPV most commonly presents as a painless, cauliflower-like anogenital wart (i.e., condyloma acuminatum) that grows over time. Although the diagnosis of HPV is most often made on a clinical basis, definitive diagnosis can be obtained via biopsy. There is currently no antiviral medication available for HPV eradication; however, ablative treatment is useful (see Table 11-12). HPV can be transmitted even when lesions are not present, and condom use does not guarantee protection because the virus is often transmitted through nonpenetrative sexual contact. Males who practice anal receptive intercourse should have yearly examinations for anal warts and, if lesions are present, a biopsy should be performed to evaluate for anal cancer. A vaccine against many serotypes of HPV (Gardasil) has shown success in various trials and was approved by the FDA in 2006, but it currently only has an indication in females aged 9\u201326 years.",

Although HSV-2 is responsible for most cases of genital infection, the prevalence of HSV-1 is rising, especially among women. The highest rates of HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States have been reported among female prostitutes and homosexual males (83%).57 Males are only one half as likely as females to be infected with both HSV-1 and HSV-2.57 There is a wide spectrum of HSV genital disease, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to a painful genital ulcer with dysuria, painful inguinal adenopathy, and fever. In men, a vesicular penile ulcer with an erythematous base and dysuria are the most common presenting symptoms. Recurrent genital lesions are common, especially with HSV-2 (60%).57 Nineteen days is the average duration of lesions seen in primary infection, and this decreases by up to 10 days with recurrences. Although transmission to sexual partners is higher with active lesions, 70% of transmissions are attributed to asymptomatic viral shedding. Transmission is greater with male versus female source patients (17% versus 4%). Diagnosis is usually suggested by a painful, shallow, genital ulcer, but viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody testing, and PCR can be used as confirmatory tests.57 PCR is especially useful in the diagnosis of asymptomatic carriage. Serologies are most helpful for epidemiologic studies and are not useful acutely to diagnose infection. Various treatment options for HSV genital infection are outlined in Table 11-12.48\n",
