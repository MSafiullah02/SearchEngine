Previous studies revealed that P protein of Rinderpest virus played an important role in transcription and replication of the genome (Kaushik and Shaila, 2004, Saikia et al., 2008). The bottleneck effects occurring during virus transmission may result in the fixation of mutation in P gene.

Muniraju et al. estimated that the evolutionary rate of PPRV genome was 9.09 \u00d7 10\u22124 nucleotide substitutions/site/year according to the analysis based on 12 PPRV genomes (Muniraju et al., 2014c). The TMRCA of PPR viruses collected in China during 2013\u20132014 is estimated to be in early August 2013, which is three months earlier than the confirmation of the first outbreak in Yili region of Xinjiang province. It is possible that the virus was transmitted into Xinjiang, China and kept undetected for several months. The presence of a single putative common ancestor around August 2013 for all PPRV China 2013\u20132014 genome sequences provided clear evidence for a single introduction of the virus. The same conclusion was drawn by previous phylogenetic analysis on N gene or F gene partial sequence (Wu et al., 2015). Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequence of N gene revealed that China/XJYL/2013 was most closely related to PPR viruses circulating in middle-Asian countries (Kock et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2015). Since no genome sequence of PPRV Central-Asian strain was available, it is not possible to investigate the phylogenomic relationship between PPRV China 2013\u20132014 strains and central-Asia strains in this study. More genome sequences of PPRV strains circulating in neighboring countries especially in central Asia will help locate the origin of PPRV China 2013\u20132014 epidemic.",

The second wave of outbreaks started from the end of January 2013 to the beginning of June 2013. During this wave of outbreaks, more than 200 sporadic outbreaks were reported in 21 provinces. It is of question how the virus spread out of Xinjiang province and then across most part of China. BSP analysis conducted in this study revealed that a sudden increase of viral population was found during January 2014, which was consistent with the occurrence of the second wave of outbreaks. The timing of this wave coincides with the Spring Festival (31st January 2014) which is associated with rising of lamb-consuming and therefore increased risk of long-distance animal transmission. Field investigation revealed that the infected farms in Xinjiang province had intended to fatten the purchased goats and sell to other provinces. In this study, we constructed the transmission pathway of the spread of virus basing on the full-length genome sequences. It revealed that viruses collected from the second wave of outbreaks shared three putative ancestor viruses with those from the first wave of outbreaks. It indicated that the second wave of PPR in China was caused by multi-origin transmission from Xinjiang Province.",

Transmission network of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia was reconstructed using full genome sequences (Assiri et al., 2013, Cotten et al., 2013). Emergence and evolution of Norovirus in Sydney was investigated by using genetic sequences (Eden et al., 2014). Evolution of Rift Valley fever virus during an outbreak in Kenya during 2006\u20132007 was described using genome sequences (Bird et al., 2008). In this study, we constructed the transmission pathway of the spread of PPR virus basing on the full-length genome sequences and identified five clusters of infections. Farms in each clusters showed dispersed geographical location, with farm-to-farm distance ranging from 360 km to 3400 km. It indicated that such transmission between farms was caused by long-distance animal movement. Putative-ancestor-virus-centered radial shape of each cluster suggested that samples collected from different province might come from a same virus origin. Previous epidemiologic analysis suggested that infected animals in different provinces could be traced back to some national livestock markets (Fan et al., 2015). These animals were found bought from the market and transferred thousands of kilometers away to the farms by trucks. The incubation period of PPR is typically 4\u20136 days, which may range between 3 and 14 days. According to the convenient highway network in China, it is suggested that the infected animals which were during incubation period were transferred from Xinjiang province to some national livestock market and then mixed with sheep and goats in the market. It is of most possibility that the suspected animals in the market were infected with PPR and were transferred to the farms in other provinces by long-distance translocation during incubation period.",

The network analysis revealed a number of long branches (more than 10 nt substitutions) between the putative ancestor virus and viruses collected from infected farms, which may indicate the presence of intermediate undetected infected farms. Although more than 200 infected farms were reported during 2013\u20132014 PPRV epidemic in China, only 25 of them were full-genome sequenced and analyzed in this study. Another possibility is that long branches were a result of intra-farm evolution of the virus within an infected farm because we analyzed only one sample from each farm. In further research, analysis with samples collected from more infected farms and more samples from one infected farm will provide deeper information on transmission pathway.",
