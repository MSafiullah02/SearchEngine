            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in children, who may experience multiple infections per year until they are 10 years of age (Arnold et al., 2006). Viruses are responsible for the majority of ARTI, with rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (INF) and parainfluenzaviruses (PIV) considered the major pathogens. Traditionally, the diagnosis of these infections relied on the isolation and identification of the viral agent by cell culture or detection of viral antigens by direct immunofluorescent assays (DFA) (Arnold et al., 2006). However, using these methods a large proportion of respiratory infections remained undiagnosed.",

            "text": "Recent advances in molecular biology, particularly the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, have greatly improved the detection of viral respiratory pathogens. Yet, even with the most sensitive molecular techniques, only 40\u201360% of infections were able to be associated consistently with a causative microorganism (Louie et al., 2005). This suggested that additional respiratory pathogens were likely to exist (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). In fact, since 2001, seven previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of clinical specimens from the human respiratory tract (Table 1\n). These are human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 2001(van den Hoogen et al., 2001), three new human coronaviruses (HCoV); the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus in 2003 (Ksiazek et al., 2003), coronavirus NL63 (NL63) in 2004 (van der Hoek et al., 2004), coronavirus HKU1 (HKU1) in 2005 (Woo et al., 2005a), as well as human bocavirus (HBoV) in 2005 (Allander et al., 2005) and the recently described human polyomaviruses KI (KIV) and WU (WUV) in 2007 (Allander et al., 2007a, Gaynor et al., 2007). These new viral agents were detected by novel molecular methods such as VIDISCA (van der Hoek et al., 2004), pan-viral DNA microarrays (Wang et al., 2003), and high throughput sequencing (Allander et al., 2005, Allander et al., 2007a, Gaynor et al., 2007) (Fig. 1\n). These methods were comprehensively reviewed by Ambrose and Clewley (2006). More broadly, the advent of these new technologies has greatly stimulated efforts to identify novel viruses in the respiratory tract and in other human disease states.",

These modified postulates now propose that a causal relationship between an organism and disease may be established if (i) the organism is consistently present in patients with the disease at a significantly greater prevalence than in matched control subjects, (ii) the disease may be replicated in an appropriate animal model after challenging with the viral pathogen, and subsequent isolation of the agent from the challenged animal, and (iii) a specific immune response to the virus by the host can be demonstrated.",

Like other human respiratory viruses, HMPV may cause upper and lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children (Williams et al., 2004, Williams et al., 2006). It is second only to RSV as a cause of bronchiolitis in early childhood (Boivin et al., 2002, Freymouth et al., 2003, van den Hoogen et al., 2003, Viazov et al., 2003, Mullins et al., 2004, Williams et al., 2004, Chano et al., 2005, Sasaki et al., 2005). Children younger than 5 years of age are most susceptible to HMPV infection (van den Hoogen et al., 2004), and those younger than 2 years of age are most likely to be hospitalized with severe symptoms, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and bronchitis (Kahn, 2006, Heikkinen et al., 2008). Recently, Heikkinen et al. (2008) showed that acute otitis media developed in 61% of HMPV-infected children younger than 3 years of age. There are no clinical manifestations of HMPV infection that are unique, and infection in young children cannot be distinguished from infection with RSV or INF (Peret et al., 2002, Bastien et al., 2003, Boivin et al., 2003, Esper et al., 2004, McAdam et al., 2004, van den Hoogen et al., 2004, Williams et al., 2004, Vicente et al., 2007). Several studies have reported the association of HMPV and asthma exacerbations in children (von Linstow et al., 2004, Williams et al., 2004, Williams et al., 2005b, Vicente et al., 2007), and with exacerbations of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (Falsey and Walsh, 2006).",

In these subjects the virus can cause prolonged and serious infections, and several case studies have described the detection of HMPV in patients with severe lung disease including several fatalities (Pelletier et al., 2002, Cane et al., 2003, Esper et al., 2004, Larcher et al., 2005, Martino et al., 2005, Williams et al., 2005a).

Usually the peak of infection is coincident with or follows the peak of RSV infection (Boivin et al., 2003, Karron et al., 2003, Osterhaus and Fouchier, 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Esper et al., 2004, Konig et al., 2004, Mullins et al., 2004, Bouscambert-Duchamp et al., 2005, Chano et al., 2005, Agapov et al., 2006, Kaida et al., 2006, Nicholson et al., 2006, Sarasini et al., 2006). Many respiratory viruses share seasonality and susceptible populations. As a result, co-detection of HMPV with other respiratory viruses has been reported at rates ranging from 1% to greater than 10% (Viazov et al., 2003, Esper et al., 2004, Williams et al., 2004, Xepapadaki et al., 2004). One study reported that dual infection with HMPV and RSV is associated with severe bronchiolitis and significantly increased the risk of admission to a paediatric intensive-care unit (Semple et al., 2005). This is at odds with previous findings which failed to detect a predisposition to more severe disease in patients with multiple respiratory virus detections (Lina et al., 1996).",

Circulating strains of HMPV differ in different populations at any single time, and the same strain may be present in geographically distinct locations in different years. In an Australian study, the predominant genotype of HMPV switched over 4 consecutive years from genotype A1 to A2 to B1 (Sloots et al., 2006a). Similar observations have been reported elsewhere (Gerna et al., 2005). So far there are no data to suggest that severity of illness may be associated with a specific genotype (Kahn, 2006).",

This suggests that primary infection with HMPV occurs early in childhood, typically between the ages of 1\u20135 years (van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Ebihara et al., 2003, Wolf et al., 2003, Leung et al., 2005).

The novel virus present in these cases was isolated from patients\u2019 lungs and sputa on Vero E6 cells (Drosten et al., 2003a, Drosten et al., 2003b, Peiris et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). Sequencing of the viral isolate showed the presence of a new human coronavirus (Rota et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). It was demonstrated that this virus was the aetiologic agent for SARS by transmission of respiratory disease to nonhuman primates (Fouchier et al., 2003). The SARS epidemic was halted by a highly effective global public health response co-ordinated by the World Health Organization, and there is no evidence that SARS\u2013CoV is currently circulating in humans. However, the SARS outbreak focussed renewed attention on coronaviruses generally, resulting in the identification of two more human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1.",

After the initial discovery, several groups have reported presence of these viruses in their populations illustrating global presence (Fouchier et al., 2004, Arden et al., 2005, Bastien et al., 2005, Chiu et al., 2005, Ebihara et al., 2005a, Kaiser et al., 2005, Moes et al., 2005, Choi et al., 2006, Esper et al., 2006, Gerna et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006b, Vabret et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2006). These reports showed that NL63 and HKU1 may be detected in 1 to 10% of patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of these viruses with other respiratory viruses was commonly reported (van der Hoek et al., 2006a). Like SARS\u2013CoV, NL63 has been successfully cultured in monkey epithelial cell lines (Fouchier et al., 2004, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Schildgen et al., 2006), but to date, it has not been possible to culture HCoV\u2013HKU1, despite attempts to do so in many cell lines. This difficulty with isolating some newly identified viruses particularly explains why they have not previously been detected.",

This virus was identified by a procedure based on DNase treatment of pooled respiratory samples, random amplification and cloning, followed by large-scale sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. In their original study, Allander et al. (2005) showed HBoV had a prevalence of 3.1% in Swedish children with LRTI. Soon thereafter, a second study from Australia reported a 5.2% prevalence of HBoV in respiratory samples collected from children with ARTI during winter (Sloots et al., 2006b). In a study of hospitalized patients, Arnold et al. (2006) detected HBoV in 5.6% of children, showing a peak prevalence of infection in spring. Subsequently, presence of the virus has been reported by investigators in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Asia, and Australia, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.5% to 11.3% in these populations (Allander et al., 2005, Arnold et al., 2006, Bastien et al., 2006, Bastien et al., 2007, Choi et al., 2006, Foulongne et al., 2006, Kesebir et al., 2006, Ma et al., 2006, Manning et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006b, Fry et al., 2007, Maggi et al., 2007, Naghipour et al., 2007, Neske et al., 2007). However, the results from these studies, regarding seasonality, indicate that there is no obvious regular seasonal occurrence of HBoV. A common feature of these studies was that HBoV was most frequently detected in infants younger than 3 years of age.",

HBoV was detected at high frequency in subjects with overt disease, whereas the virus was either not found or was found very infrequently in control subjects.

Also, Albuquerque et al. (2008) reported the detection of HBoV in Brazilian children with gastroenteritis in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Although these findings suggest that HBoV may play a role as an agent of acute gastroenteritis, it is possible that this is a clinical presentation of a systemic response to HBoV infection by the host. This data however, does add new knowledge about potential mechanisms of transmission for this virus.",

It is however difficult to assess the pathogenic role of these viruses without examining samples collected from matched control populations. Three recent studies have sought to do this for WUV, reporting prevalence rates in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects of 7.0% versus 4.2% (Han et al., 2007), 2.5% versus 6.4% (Abed et al., 2007) and 1.0% versus 5.4% (Norja et al., 2007). However, these data must be interpreted with caution as each of these studies examined only small numbers of controls and some of these were not well matched to the symptomatic population tested. Interestingly, although Norja et al. (2007) reported a high prevalence of KIV (5.4%) and WUV (5.4%) in their control subjects, 5 of the 6 (83%) positive specimens came from subjects who were classified as immunosuppressed. If consistent, the presence of KIV and WUV in control populations may represent a latent or persistent infection with subsequent asymptomatic reactivation or prolonged shedding from a prior respiratory tract infection.",
