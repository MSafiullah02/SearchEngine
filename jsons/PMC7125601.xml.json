Because the intracellular target for a wide range of anticancer and antibiotic drugs is DNA, the binding studies of small molecules with DNA are very useful in understanding the drug\u2013DNA interactions, designing new and promising drugs for clinical use and developing sensitive chemical probes of nucleic acid structure. Although DNA has a natural fluorescence, the intensity is so weak that the direct use of the fluorescence emission of DNA is limited to study its properties [10]. Ethidium bromide (EB), acridine orange, methylene blue and similar fluorescent compounds are normally used to probe DNA structure in drug\u2013DNA and protein\u2013DNA interactions [11]. The binding of these pigments to double-stranded DNA greatly enhances their fluorescence intensity and lifetime [12], [13], [14]. There is a higher affinity of EB with DNA duplex because EB provides greater accessibility for DNA binding rather than acridine orange and methylene blue [15]. Thus, EB was selected as the probe in this paper.",

This family of polyphenolic compounds is an important constituent of the human diet, where the average intake is in the range of 50\u2013800 mg/day [17]. Variation in the two benzene rings (A and B) of the basic structure gives rise to flavonols, flavones, catechins, flavanones, anthocyanidins and isoflavones. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is one of the most common flavones present in nature. It is also one commonly used herbal medicine in China and other East Asian countries, and it has been officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia for a long time [18]. Baicalein, wogonin and baicalin (Fig. 1\n(a\u2013c)) are the main active components in Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi [19]. These components possess anti-allergic [20], antioxidant [21], [22], anti-HIV [23], [24], anti-inflammatory [25], anti-tumor [26], [27], [28], anxiolytic [29], anti-hepatitis B virus [30], antigenotoxic activity [31], and anti-SARS coronavirus effects [32].",

Flavonoids form the stable compound with various metal cations, which have demonstrable antibacterial properties and anti-tumor activity [36], [37]. It is obvious that a better knowledge of the interaction between flavonoid\u2013metal complexes and DNA may permit a better understanding of the biological and pharmaceutical properties of flavonoids in presence of metals.

Generally, red shift (or blue shift) and hypochromic (or hyperchromic) effect are observed in the absorption spectra of small molecules if they intercalate with DNA. The UV\u2013vis spectra of the flavonoids are characterized by two transitions: a lowest energy absorption in the 304\u2013350 nm region (bandI), and a highest energy band in the 250\u2013280 nm region (bandII). The absorption spectra of flavonoids are given in Fig. 2\n. Baicalein has three peaks, 217, 275 and 335 nm, wogonin has four peaks, 214, 240, 280 and 360 nm, respectively and baicalin has three peaks, 215, 278 and 315 nm. The absorption peaks of 275, 280 and 278 nm are attributed to the absorption of benzoly of ring A (bandII), and the absorption peaks of 335, 360 and 315 nm are attributed to the absorption of cinnamoyl of ring B (bandI). The spectral changes in the presence of DNA are clearly observed. Because there is no substituent group of ring B, the absorption at 335, 360 and 315 nm is without any change. A blue shift of 14, 6 and 6 nm are observed from the absorption at 275, 280 and 278 nm, and the absorption intensity increase by 97.9%, 42.9% and 45.8% when 0.11 mmol L\u22121 DNA is added, respectively. Because the A ring in the flavonoids is coplanar with the B ring and the A ring is stabilized by the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds (O2\u2013H\u2013O5), which would also facilitate its entry into the intercalation site. The electronic absorption spectra of the three kinds of flavonoids in the presence of DNA show strong hyperchromicity and blue shift in the absorption of benzoly of ring A, indicating the intercalation of the three kinds of flavonoids with DNA.",

Fluorescence quenching can be dynamic, resulting from the collisional encounters between the fluorophore and quencher, or static, resulting from the formation of a ground-state complex between the fluorophore and quencher [47]. The plots of the quenching of EB bound to DNA by the flavonoids progressively loose its linearity, which indicates that not only one type of quenching process occurred. First, based on the Stern\u2013Volmer equation and curves in Fig. 6, the K\nsv can be obtained (Table 1\n). Based on K\nsv\n = \nK\nq\n\u03c4\n0 and \u03c4\n0 values [43], [47], the K\nq can be obtained (Table 1). For baicalein, wogonin and baicalin, the values of K\nq (Table 1) are much greater than 2.0 \u00d7 1010\n L s\u22121\n mol\u22121, the maximum diffusion collision quenching rate constant of various quenchers with biopolymers [49]. The experimental results demonstrate that the quenching process is static quenching. Secondly, dynamic quenching depends upon diffusion. Since increasing the temperature results in higher diffusion coefficients, the quenching constants are expected to increase [45], [50]. The deviation of the plots toward the y-axis and the upward concave curvature are significant when the temperature increases. The increasing of the angular coefficient caused by the higher temperature suggests the occurrence of dynamic quenching for DNA\u2013EB quenching by flavonoids. On the other hand, a non-linear Stern\u2013Volmer plot may be suggestive of the existence of more than one binding site with different accessibilities for flavonoids in the proximity of DNA, and such sites would facilitate flavonoids penetration into the hydrophobic region of DNA. It is also possible that the increasing number of binding sites can be the result of conformational changes in the DNA molecule, or it may indicate the occurrence of combined quenching.",

These results show that the binding of flavonoids to DNA is endothermic, and the acting force between flavonoids and DNA is mainly hydrophobic interaction forces. When the chromophore penetrates the DNA helix, the main interaction is hydrophobic contact, but the van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds cannot be excluded. The stabilization of the flavonoid\u2013DNA complexes is due to a hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic segment of the flavonoids and the intercalation site, which would permit this part of the chromophore to penetrate the DNA helix and to arrange its planar structure parallel to the adjacent planes of the nitrogenous bases. It is known that the hydrogen bond can be formed to stabilize the already intercalated molecules. A strong hydrogenous bond between a flavone (2,6-dimethoxyflavone) and orthophosphoric acid was found in an interesting study based on X-ray crystallographic data [53].",

Intercalation of small molecules into the double helix is known to cause stabilization of base stacking and increase the DNA melting temperature, at which the double helix denatures into single stranded DNA [55]. Intercalation binding can stabilize the double helix structure and T\nm increases by about 5\u20138 \u00b0C, but the non-intercalation binding causes no obvious increase in T\nm\n[56]. The DNA melting curves obtained in the absence and presence of flavonoids are shown in Fig. 7\n, and the T\nm value decreases from 89 to 85 \u00b0C. Because the planar of flavonoids is different with the rigid planar of the typical intercalator, the decreased value is less than those obtained with classical intercacators.

However, a partial and/or nonclassical intercalation of ligand may bend (or kink) the DNA helix, resulting in the decrease of the effective length and the viscosity [57], [58], [59]. Fig. 8\nshows the effect of increasing the flavonoid concentration on the relative viscosity of the DNA. The relative viscosity of DNA increases, which follows the order, baicalein > baicalin > wogonin. The increased relative viscosity of DNA indicates the intercalation of flavonoids into DNA, which can be also explained by the molecular structure, as the A ring in the flavonoids is coplanar with the B ring and the A ring is stabilized by the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds (O2\u2013H\u2013O5) that may lead to the intercalative mode.",

It is apparent that intercalative binding and groove binding are related to the groove in the DNA double helix, but the electrostatic binding can take place out of the groove. When NaCl exists in the system, the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate skeletons on adjacent nucleotides is reduced with increasing the concentration of Na+. That is to say, electrostatic interactions are shielded by the presence of ions and the DNA chains will be tightened. However, for groove binding modes, a small molecule binds in the groove of DNA duplex and exposes much more to the solvent surrounding than it does for the intercalation [56], [60]. Thus, the groove bound molecules can be released from the helix by increasing the ionic strength, whereas it is difficult for the intercalating bound molecules to be released [56]. So the effect of NaCl on the fluorescence of flavonoid\u2013DNA\u2013EB and DNA\u2013EB were studied. Classical intercalators are planar aromatic ring systems such as acridines, anthracyclines, EB, etc. [61]. In particular, EB molecule is a planar aromatic ring system positively charged. Thus, the interaction between EB and DNA has two binding modes: intercalative binding and electrostatic binding.",

It can be seen from Table 4 that the quenching constants increase with the increase of the ionic strength. The reason of the increase for quenching constants is that the EB molecule by electrostatic binding is released from the helix due to the electrostatic attraction between phosphate group and Na+. However, the EB molecule by intercalative binding cannot be influenced by the ionic strength. On the other hand, the existence of Na+ ions makes the double helix structure of DNA gather together longitudinally, and flavonoids are likely to intercalate the helix through the addition of salt. These results indicate that ionic strength has an influence on the binding behavior of EB with DNA, however, the effect of ionic strength on the flavonoids\u2013DNA system is very limited. So the interaction between flavonoids and DNA is intercalative binding.",

The peak of 270 nm with addition of Cu(II) or Mg(II) first shows a decrease in the absorbance, and then an increase with blue shift (13 nm). Red shift occurs at peak of 344 nm (14 nm). But the absorption spectra of baicalein\u2013Al(III) complex only shows a decrease of the absorption intensity. The titration of baicalein\u2013metal complexes is characterized by forming two isosbestic points, and the absorption spectra appear a new peak at the wavelength of 426 nm and increase progressively in absorbance, which indicate that baicalein can form stable complexes with metal ions.",

Fluorescence quenching experiments were conducted by adding flavonoids into the samples containing the fixed of DNA\u2013EB and metal ions concentration. When the molar ratio of the flavonoid to DNA increased, the extent of the fluorescence quenching increased gradually at the same concentration of the metal ions. The quenching curves are shown in Fig. 10\n. It can also be found from Fig. 10 that the fluorescence of DNA\u2013EB is quenched efficiently by the baicalein\u2013Al(III) complex. When baicalein concentration increases to 2.66 \u00d7 10\u22125\n mol L\u22121, the change of fluorescence intensity tends to be constant. However, the action of baicalin\u2013Al(III) to quench the DNA\u2013EB is weakened in the system. The planarity of baicalein\u2013Al(III) complex efficiently intercalates into DNA base pairs, but the branch chain of baicalin is not helpful to intercalate. The branch chain of baicalin is likely to bind DNA by out-side self-stacking along the DNA helix, or bind DNA in the groove. This can be explained that baicalein\u2013Al(III) has a higher binding affinity with DNA compared with wogonin\u2013Al(III) and baicalin\u2013Al(III).",

There are a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity (>50%) and a red shift in the emission wavelength. These spectral characteristics strongly support intercalation of flavonoids into DNA, and the intercalated EB is displaced from the DNA\u2013EB complex by flavonoids. This conclusion is further reinforced by melting experiments, viscosity measurements and salt effects. From a variety of experiments, it is concluded that baicalein, wogonin and baicalin intercalate into the double-stranded DNA molecules, which accounts for the high binding constant. In addition to the binding mode, the complete thermodynamic profiles for the binding of flavonoids to DNA are also constructed, and results show that the binding of flavonoids to DNA is endothermic. The different behavior of baicalein, wogonin and baicalin binding to DNA duplex is due to the different side chain of the benzoly of ring A, and the branch chain of baicalein provides greater accessibility for DNA binding than those of wogonin and baicalin. This is also confirmed by the spectral and viscosity measurements, so that the benzoly of ring A of the planarity of flavonoids is important for binding.",
