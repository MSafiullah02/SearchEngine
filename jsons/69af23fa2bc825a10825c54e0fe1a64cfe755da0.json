The pandemic started to develop strongly by the end of January and beginning of February 2020, first in China with subsequent rapid spread to other countries with new epicenters of the outbreaks concentrated mainly within the 30-50\u00baN latitudinal band (e.g., South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain). Simultaneously, an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing at latitudes around 40\u00baN was observed on global scale, in line with an anomalously strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. This atypical situation could have resulted in favorable meteorological conditions for a quicker spread of the virus over the latitude band detailed above. This possible connection needs further attention in order to understand the meteorological and climatological factors related to the COVID-19",

            "text": "Interestingly, it has been pointed out recently that the first main COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in regions and countries along an east-west longitudinal direction within a latitude band between 30-50\u00baN. On average, it seems that these regions had in common a mean air temperature of around 5-11\u00baC and low specific humidity levels of around 3-6 g/kg (Sajadi et al., 2020) . Thus, after the outbreak in China in early January 2020, the disease mainly moved in February and March to countries such as Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Spain, which are all located within the above mentioned latitudinal band, while not affecting significantly other regions immediately north and south of China. This spatial spread of the main outbreaks between January and early March 2020 does not seem to follow either population proximity connections or volume of international exchanges (Sajadi et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is plausible that the anomalous atmospheric circulation pattern that occurred between January and March 2020, characterized by strong high-3 pressure anomalies centered in the 40\u00baN belt, helped to modulate the spatial pattern of the first outbreaks of the COVID-19. The AO is a teleconnection pattern that summarizes the northern polar vortex variability at surface level (Baldwin et al., 2003) , and is characterized by pressure anomalies of one sign over the Arctic and the Norwegian sea, balanced by anomalies of opposite sign centred around latitudes between 35 and 50\u00b0 of the Northern Hemisphere. The positive phase pattern of the AO shows lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic region and higherthan-average pressure at mid-latitudes. The AO index for JFM 2020 reached exceptionally high values during these three months; in fact, they are the maximum ever recorded for the available 1950-2020 period ( Figure 2 ). These anomalous positive values of the AO resulted in a reinforced polar vortex during JFM 2020, in line with the maps shown in Figure 1 . A strong polar vortex in February and March delays the spring arrival in the polar stratosphere, keeping very low temperatures in its core and producing stratospheric ozone depletion (Rex et al., 2004) . Indeed, a remarkable ozone loss was registered over the Arctic 4 region during last March 2020 (Witze, 2020) . Moreover, it is interesting to note that the dynamical forcing by the greenhouse gases related to the anthropogenic climate change could lead to an enhancement of the AO (Shindell et al., 2001) .",

In fact, for example, the rate of deaths per population by the end of March 2020 averaged over latitude bands shows a clear maximum centred around 40\u00baN, which matches the peak in positive air pressure anomalies (Figure 1, right) . It can be argued that along this band corridor around 35-50\u00baN, the positive pressure anomalies caused a tendency towards dry and calm conditions, as well as temperate conditions, that fit with the optimal meteorological conditions for the initial spread of the COVID-19 as has been reported by Sajadi et al. (2020) . For instance, Sanchez-Lorenzo et al. (2020) have shown that the unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 could have resulted in ideal atmospheric conditions for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. Therefore, in a year without this anomalous positive AO index, the same mild temperatures and low specific humidity levels recorded this JFM 2020 might have not been observed, and consequently a different spatiotemporal spread of the COVID-19 disease would have been expected.",

This anomalous atmospheric circulation may have provided optimal meteorological conditions for the virus propagation by decreasing the body's defense mechanisms, favoring the social contact patterns and/or enhancing the transmission of the 5 virus by means of the droplets and aerosols emitted after a cough. In fact, the strong stability associated with the anticyclonic conditions and subsidence along the 40\u00baN band may have promoted the airborne transmission, which has been recently suggested as a crucial way to infect people with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (Morawska and Cao, 2020) .",

A clear evidence of a stable atmospheric circulation can be seen (i.e., positive anomalies) along the 30-50\u00baN belt of the Northern Hemisphere, and the opposite (i.e., negative anomalies) north of 60\u00baN.The latitudinal averages of the 300 hPa and 500 hPa(Figure 1, right) highlight a maximum of the anomalies centered just at 40\u00baN, whereas very negative anomalies are reached above 70\u00baN.
