Members of the Bovidae group of mammals are distinguished by characteristics such as an even number of toes, a compartmentalized forestomach, and horns. These animals are obligate herbivores and, as adults, derive all their glucose from gluconeogenesis. The subfamily Caprinae includes sheep and goats. The genus and subgenus Ovis includes domestic sheep as well as wild Asian and European sheep species. Domestic sheep are Ovis aries. The subgenus Pachyceros includes the wild North American species as well as snow sheep (O. nivicola) of northeastern Siberia. Capra hircus is the domestic goat that originated from western Asian goats. Capra pyrenaica (Spanish goat), C. ibex (goats of the Red Sea and Caucasus area), and C. falconiere (wild goat of Afghanistan and Pakistan) are other members of the genus. The subfamily Bovinae and genus Bos include all domestic and wild cattle. The subgenus taurus contains all of today's domestic cattle. Common genus and species terminology for modern-day cattle includes Bos taurus and B. indicus. Bos taurus (domestic cattle), originally from the European continent, have no hump over the withers. Bos indicus, also known as Zebu cattle, have a hump over the withers and drooping ears. These cattle include breeds found in the tropics and are extremely heat tolerant, and some breeds are known for parasite resistance. Bos taurus and B. indicus have been crossed, and new breeds have been developed during this century (Briggs and Briggs, 1980; Walker et al., 1983).",

Healthy, normal young ruminants serve as models of cardiac transplantation and as preclinical models for evaluation of cardiac assist or prosthetic devices, such as vascular stents and cardiac valves (Salerno et al., 1998). For many years, ruminants have been useful research subjects for reproductive research, such as research on embryo transfer, artificial insemination, and control of the reproductive cycle (Wall et al., 1997). Several important milestones in gene transfer, cloning, nuclear transfer, and genetic engineering techniques have been developed or demonstrated using these species (Ebert et al., 1994; Schnieke, 1997; Cibelli et al., 1998a,b) (see Fig. 1\n). One of many proposed uses of genetically engineered ruminants is the production of proteins that will be secreted in the milk and later isolated (Ebert et al., 1994; Memon and Ebert, 1992). Healthy sheep and goats are also often used for antibody production (Hanly et al., 1995). Genome mapping developed rapidly during the 1990s; extensive information is available and is increasing for sheep and cattle (Broad et al., 1998; Womack, 1998).",

These animals provide obvious benefits over the use of cattle in research from the standpoint of size, ease of handling, cost of maintenance, and docile behavior. Sheep are also widely used models for basic and applied fetal and reproductive research (Buttar, 1997; Rees et al., 1998; Ross and Nijland, 1998). The species is used for investigating circadian rhythms related to day length (Lehman et al., 1997), and the interaction between olfactory cues and behavior (Kendrick et al., 1997). The number and diversity of natural- and induced-disease research models in sheep are great and increasing. Natural models include congenital hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic organic anion excretory defect (Dubin-Johnson syndrome) in the Corriedale breed, congenital hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic organic anion uptake defect (Gilbert syndrome) in the Southdown breed, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in the Dorset breed, GM1 gangliosidosis in the Suffolk breed, and pulmonary adenomatosis (jaagsiekte) in many breeds (Hegreberg, 1981a). Induced models include arteriosclerosis, hemorrhagic shock, copper poisoning (Wilson's disease), and metabolic toxocosis (Hegreberg, 1981b).",

Stress decreases feed intake, and the resulting energy, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies will affect the growth and development in younger animals. Reproductive soundness and rumen function are affected by transport and similar stresses. Standard practices such as weaning, castration, dehorning, vaccinations, deworming and treatments for external parasites, shipping and the associated feed and water deprivation, introduction to a new housing environment and new personnel, and intercurrent disease are all stressors (Houpt, 1998). Animals should be acclimated to the use of halters and leads, temporary restraint devices, and other handling equipment associated with the research program. Personnel in the research facility who are unfamiliar with ruminants should be trained in appropriate handling techniques. Appreciation for ruminant behaviors has grown in recent years, and refined ruminant handling techniques have been published (Houpt, 1998; Grandin, 1998).",

Even adult goats and younger cattle are quite comfortable in cold, even subfreezing temperatures, if provided with adequate amounts of dry dust-free bedding and draft protection. Sheep, because of their wool, are remarkably tolerant to both hot and cold extremes. Newborn lambs and recently shorn adults are susceptible to hypothermia, hyperthermia, and sunburn.

Chain-link fences are dangerous because goats (as well as some breeds and ages of sheep) are curious and tend to stand on their hind legs against fencing or walls. Fore-limbs may be caught easily in the mesh. Floors in any areas where animals will be housed, led, or herded must ensure secure footing at all times to prevent slipping injuries. All ruminants are social and herding animals. Therefore, they should be housed in groups or at least within eyesight and hearing of other animals. Singly housed animals should have regular human contact. Environmental enrichment should be governed by the experimental protocol or standard operating procedures, and durable play objects should be supplied to those animals that are housed in confinement. Calves, in particular, that must be singly housed or that have been recently weaned, need play objects (Morrow-Tesch, 1997).",

There is a three-compartment forestomach (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) and a true stomach (abomasum). The mature rumen functions as an anaerobic fermentation chamber in which the enzymes, such as cellulase, of the resident bacteria allow the animals to prosper as herbivores. Digestion is also aided by other microorganisms, such as protozoa (105\u2013106/ml) and bacteria (109\u20131010/ml), that contribute to rumen fermentation. The result is the production of volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, and butyric). Unlike in the monogastrics, fermentative digestion and volatile fatty acid absorption also occur in the large intestines. The main sources of energy for ruminants are volatile fatty acids (VFAs) rather than glucose. Glucose is formed from propionic acid (or from amino acids) for metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS), uterus, and mammary glands. Plasma glucose in ruminants is much lower than and is regulated differently from that in nonruminants. The rumen microorganisms also synthesize vitamins, such as B and K, and provide protein that is used by the animals\u2019 systems. Large amounts of fermentation gases such as CO2 and methane, and small amounts of nitrogen, are naturally eructed (Hecker, 1983; Schimdt et al., 1988).",

Goats are browsers and will readily eat grasses, as well as seeds, nuts, fruit, and woody-stemmed plants. Goats, however, can also be selective eaters and will only eat the leafy, more nutritious parts of the plant. Therefore, goats have a tendency to \u201cwaste\u201d hay. Other eating habits should also be considered. Finely ground concentrates are not tolerated well by goats; pelleted concentrates are preferred because the goat will pick out large particles in mixes. Generally, goats do not prefer \u201csweet\u201d feeds that contain molasses and do not need supplemental concentrates if a good-quality pasture or hay is fed. When given access to a salt block, goats generally are self-regulating. Grass-fed goats and lactating goats may need supplementation with calcium and phosphorus, whereas alfalfa-fed goats do not (Bretzlaff et al., 1991). Horse and sheep feeds may be fed to goats provided that the feed does not contain much molasses (Bretzlaff et al., 1991). The copper content of horse feed is not excessive for goats, as it is for sheep. Pelleted horse feeds with 25\u201328% fiber and 12\u201314% protein are good goat rations.

In some cases, the presence of mature cycling cows influences heifer puberty. With adequate nutrition, dairy breeds will reach puberty at 10\u201312 months and beef breeds at 11\u201315 months, and estrous cycles will occur regularly after the pubertal (first) estrus. Maturing heifers will often have one or more ovulations before showing overt signs of estrus. Only one follicle usually ovulates per estrous cycle (Hafez, 1987) Estrus, or standing heat, in cattle averages 12\u201316 hr in length, with a range of 6\u201324 hr (\u201cLarge Animal Internal Medicine,\u201d 1996). Detection of standing heat is important because it is closely related to the time of ovulation. Ovulation occurs approximately 25\u201332 hr after estrus. Detection of estrus is usually accomplished by visual observation of vaginal mucous discharge, mounting behavior by other females (i.e., the cow standing to be mounted is the individual in estrus), and receptivity to a bull (willingness to stand). Successful visual detection of standing heat is dependent on observation skills of handlers, knowledge of the herd, stresses (e.g., detection decreased in Bos taurus during heat stress), barn and yard surfaces (estrus detected better on dirt than on concrete), and maintaining a consistent observation schedule. Teaser animals outfitted with marking devices are also used. Other methods of detecting estrus include monitoring progesterone levels; glass slide and other evaluations of cervical mucus; change in vaginal pH; and body temperature changes (Hafez, 1987). Estrous cycles are usually 21 days in length, with a range of 17\u201325 days. It is recommended that a heifer deliver her first calf by 2 years of age.",

If possible, the dam should be confined to a birthing pasture or sanitized maternity pen a few days prior to parturition. The birthing environment will be very important in the overall health of the dam and offspring; stress minimization and a clean environment will benefit the immune health of both in the short and long term. Outdoor parturition in a small birthing pasture has advantages. There is less stress and less intensity of pathogens. Indoor maternity pens should be clean, dry, warm, well bedded, well ventilated but draft-free, and well lighted. Adequate space per pen minimizes losses of neonates from being stepped and sat on by the dam. Management of these pens, especially if concentrated in an area, is important to minimize pathogens to which dam and young are exposed. Water troughs or buckets should be elevated or placed outside the pen, because lambs and kids have a tendency to fall or be pushed into them. Soiled bedding should be removed from the birthing pen between dams, the area sanitized and allowed to dry, and fresh bedding installed for the next occupant. Moving the female immediately before or during parturition may delay the birthing process. In goats, furthermore, in utero death may occur if parturition is unduly delayed. Dams should be monitored closely during parturition for dystocias; these may result in loss of young or in young severely weakened from the prolonged birthing process.",

Crutching refers to removing wool around the perineal and mammary areas; this minimizes fetal contamination during the birth process. Foot trimming can be done at this time as well. The tail and perineal area of the doe should be clipped and cleaned to improve postbirth sanitation. In general, the pregnant doe needs a 14ft2(1.2 m \u00d7 1.2 m) area for the birthing process, and area needs to be increased after birthing to allow spacing for kids. Each cow should have a minimum pen area of 10 ft \u00d7 10 ft. Evaluation of a cow's udder prior to breeding and especially as parturition approaches is important in order to assure adequate nutrition and success of passive transfer by the neonate. If the udder is edematous or if mastitis is present, for example, an alternate source of colostrum (such as frozen reserves) must made be available. Poor udder conformation may also be problematic; contingency plans should be made to ensure adequate support for the young if they cannot suckle from those udders. Inexperienced heifers may react indifferently or aggressively to their offspring and should be monitored more closely than older, multiparous cows with uneventful calving histories.",

Approximately 24 hr prior to birth, rectal temperature will fall to slightly below normal. Many large dairy-goat facilities attempt to control the onset of parturition in order to assist birthing. The drug of choice to induce parturition in the goat is prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) (Ott, 1982). On day 144 of gestation, goats given PGF2\u03b1 (2.5\u20135 mg) will deliver kids within 28\u201357 hr. Most goats prefer to kid alone and do so unaided. Human interaction can actually interfere with normal birthing, especially in young or nervous does. Some does may reject kids if extensive human interference occurs. Does nearing parturition have an obviously swollen udder and a red, swollen vulva. Pelvic ligaments at the base of tail relax. The doe may circle to make a bed, get up and down, look at her tail or sides, push other goats away, and bleat softly. Signs of impending parturition include restlessness; vocalization (bleating softly); uneasiness, including getting up and down, pawing, and bedding; and a mucous discharge, leading to a moist tail. Eight to 12 hr prior to parturition, the cervix will dilate and the cervical mucous plug will be evident as a tan, smeared substance on the tail and perineum of the dam. Kids should present within 1\u20136 hr in either anterior or posterior position. A posterior presentation can be recognized by the presence of upward-pointing feet. Most does will rest between fetuses and are best left alone. However, if labor is prolonged more than 1 hr, a vaginal exam is indicated.",

Administration of ACTH to a fetus, or administration to the dam, results in premature birth. Pregnancy is extended if fetal pituitary or adrenal glands are removed surgically. The fetal cortisol probably affects placental steroid production, accounting for sharp increases in the estrogens and estrogen precursors. Coincident with this, maternal progesterone levels fall. The rising levels of estrogen cause release of maternal PGF2\u03b1 and induction of oxytocin receptors. Most cows will separate themselves from the rest of the herd. A cow will lift her tail and arch her back when she is within a few hours of delivering the calf, and most cows are recumbent when delivering the calf. Typically, the whole birthing process takes about 100 min. The length of labor of cows carrying larger calves also will be longer. Nervous heifers will take longer to deliver, and if they are disturbed, their labor may cease. All postparturient animals should be monitored for successful passage of these fetal membranes within 12 hr of birth. Veterinary intervention is required if not. Cows occasionally eat placentas, which may subsequently obstruct rumen outflow and require surgical correction. For cattle, it is now recommended practice to remove membranes that have passed, in order to prevent ingestion.",

In a well-managed flock, many lambs and ewes will not need much assistance. When assistance is given, the newborn lamb's nose and mouth should be wiped free of secretions; gently swinging the lambs, head down, aids in removal of these fluids. The lamb should be dried off and stimulated through rubbing to aid its breathing. The lamb's navel should be dipped in an iodine solution to prevent subsequent navel infections. And the lamb should be identified by the application of an ear tag or ear notch. It is extremely important that the lamb be supplied with high-quality colostrum within the first 12 hr of birth. Lambs that are not nursing on their own should be tube-fed with colostrum that has been collected and saved previously (i.e., frozen in ice cube trays) or collected from the mother after parturition. Passive transfer can be assessed by measuring serum \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels (Tessman et al., 1997). After the first few days, colostrum changes over to milk. Nursing lambs will ingest increasing amounts of milk as they grow. If the ewe cannot produce sufficient milk, the lamb should be \u201cgrafted\u201d onto another ewe or fed artificially with a baby bottle. Powdered milk replacers are commercially available; the content of ewe milk is much different from that of cow's milk; thus lamb milk replacer should specifically be used. One report notes that 50\u201370% of lamb deaths occur during the first week of life and up to 90% occur within the first month. Good management of ewes during gestation, care of the lamb at parturition, application of an appropriate vaccination program, and observation and intervention within the first several weeks of a lamb's life will minimize losses (Ross, 1989).",

            "text": "Synchronization of cattle estrous cycles and superovulation are used as management techniques in certain commercial cattle and dairy production settings where estrus synchronization or embryo transfer is advantageous to production and management. The methodology is also used in the research setting for coordinating donors and recipients of embryos or other genetically manipulated tissues for implantation. The options and dosing regimens are described in detail in veterinary clinical texts (Wenzel, 1997; Vanderboom et al., 1997). In synchronization, the principle is lysis of the existing corpus luteum. The more common practices involve the use of products approved for use in cattle such as PGF2\u03b1, one of its analogs, or products containing estradiol valerate. Progestogens are also used in conjunction with estradiol valerate. Other approaches, involving management techniques combined with pharmacologic interventions, are considered less successful. Superovulation regimens involve injections of FSH either alone or with PGF2\u03b1 at timed internals. Estrus is expected 48 hr after the final injection, and two inseminations are performed at 12 hr intervals after estrus detection. Preparation of recipients involves injection of PGF2\u03b1 or progestogens with gonadotropins such as PMSG. For greatest success as management tools, these must be combined with a consistent program that provides appropriate nutrition for all cattle involved. Synchronization of animals is also influenced by several other factors, however, such as time in the cycle when hormones are administered, response by each individual animal, whether the cow is a dairy or beef animal, parity and maturity of the cows, success of heat detection after the luteolysis, and accurate record keeping.",

In sheep, about 1 week after breeding, the embryos are surgically removed from the donor's uterus. In cattle, the procedure is nonsurgical. About 75% of expected embryos (determined by counting corpora lutea) can be recovered; successful recovery is affected by factors such as age of the donor, reproductive health, and experience of the surgeon or technician. Furthermore, not all collected embryos are of transferable quality. Recipients are hormonally synchronized with the donor animals. On the day of embryo collection, transferable embryos are implanted into the uterus of the recipient; laparoscopy has been used in the past and is now being replaced by nonsurgical methods.

Once semen is collected, it should be handled carefully and kept warm to prevent sperm death, leading to improper conclusions about the male. Typically, the characteristics usually evaluated as a determinate of sperm quality are volume (normal between 0.7 and 2.0 ml); motility (% of sperm moving in a forward wave; high quality is associated with motility of approximately 90%); concentration (sperm count per unit of volume as measured by a hemocytometer; high-quality semen should contain 1.8 \u00d7 109 sperm per ml); morphology (live versus dead cells, as determined by special stains and the percentage of abnormal-appearing sperm; neither the abnormalities nor the dead sperm should exceed 10% in high-quality semen).",

Generally, fine-wooled breeds, such as Rambouillet, are the most gregarious and are best handled in groups. The meat, or \u201cdowns,\u201d breeds tend to be less gregarious, and the long-wooled breeds tend to be solitary (Ross, 1989; ASIA, 1996). Nonetheless, movement of animals is simplified by proper facility design. Sheep have a wide-angle visual field and are easily scared by activities that are taking place behind them. Sheep should be moved slowly and gently. To capture individuals within a flock, it is best to confine the flock to a smaller space and use a shepherd's crook or to gently catch the animal in front of the neck/thorax. Grabbing the wool can injure the animals, as well as damage the wool and the underlying tissues. Sheep move best in chutes that have solid walls, and individual animals will generally follow a lead animal. Any escape route will be challenged and, if successfully breached, will disrupt the entire flock movement. Sheep movement is also disrupted by contrasts such as light and shadows that impinge on a chute or corral. Finally, like most animals, sheep have a flight zone (minimum zone of comfort), the penetration of which will result in sheep scattering. This minimal flight distance can be modified by increasing handling of the animals and working at the edge of the zone, but it should always be considered when working with animals in chutes, pens, or other confined areas.",

Goats are also inquisitive, restless, agile jumpers and climbers, and quite mischievous. If maintained in paddocks, strong high fences are essential, as are adequate spaces for exercise or boulders or rock piles for hoof maintenance and recreational climbing. Goats are more tolerant of isolation and are more easily acclimated to human contact than sheep are, but goats will confront unfamiliar intruders and make sneezing noises.

In cows, the organism localizes in supramammary lymph nodes and udders and in the endometrium and placenta of pregnant cows. Infection may cause abortions after the fifth month, with resulting retained placentas. Permanent infection of the udder is common and results in shedding of organisms in milk.

Clinically, the encephalitic form begins with depression, anorexia, and mild hyperthermia after an incubation period of 2\u20133 weeks. As the disease progresses, animals exhibit nasal discharges and conjunctivitis and begin to walk in circles, as if disoriented. Facial paralytic lesions, including drooping of an ear or eyelid, dilation of a nostril, or strabismus occur unilaterally on the affected side as the result of dysfunction of some or all the cranial nerves V-XII. The neck will by flexed away from the affected side. Facial muscle twitching, protrusion of the tongue, dysphagia, hypersalivation, and nasal discharges may be noted.

Skin or teat lesions and dermatitis increase the prevalence of disease. Acute mastitis can be diagnosed in ewes with associated systemic signs of disease by physical examination of the udder and inspection of the milk. Subclinical mastitis is often suggested by somatic cell counts elevated above 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. When high somatic cell counts are identified, subclinical mastitis can be diagnosed by milk culture. The California mastitis test may also be helpful as an indicator of mastitis. Manual palpation of a hard, indurated udder as well as serological testing for the maedi/visna virus is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of diffuse chronic mastitis. Treatment for acute bacterial mastitis should include aggressive application of broad-spectrum antibiotics (intramammary and systemic) and supportive therapy such as fluids and anti-inflammatory drugs. It is may be helpful to milk out the infected udder frequently; oxytocin injections preceding milking will improve gland evacuation.

The mortality rate in more mature cattle is low, however, unless there is secondary bacterial pneumonia. Fever, anorexia, restlessness, hyperemia of the muzzle, gray pustules on the muzzle (that later form plaques), nasal discharge (that may progress from serous to mucopurulent), hyperpnea, coughing, salivation, conjunctivitis with excessive epiphora, and decreased production in dairy animals are typical signs. Open-mouth breathing may be seen if the larynx or nasopharygneal areas are blocked by mucopurulent discharges. Neonatal calves may develop respiratory as well as general systemic disease. In these cases, in addition to the symptoms already noted, the soft palate may become necrotic, and gastrointestinal tract ulceration occurs. Young calves are most susceptible to the encephalitic form; signs include dull attitude, head pressing, vocalizations, nystagmus, head tilt, blindness, convulsions, and coma, as well as some signs, such as discharges, seen with respiratory tract presentations. This form is usually fatal within 5 days. Abortion may occur simultaneously with the conjunctival or respiratory tract diseases, when the respiratory infection appears to be mild, or may be delayed by as much as 3 months after the respiratory tract disease signs. Infectious pustular vulvovaginitis is most commonly seen in dairy cows, and clinical signs may be mild and not noticed. Otherwise, signs are fever, depression, anorexia, swelling of the vulvar labia, vulvar discharge, and vestibular mucosa reddened by pustules.

If uncomplicated, the infection lasts about 4\u20135 days, and lesions heal in 2 weeks.

The profound impact of this disease on the cattle industry in Great Britain during the past two decades is well known. The disease may be caused by a scrapielike (prion) agent. It is believed that the source of infection for cattle was feedstuff derived from sheep meat and bonemeal that had been inadequately treated during processing. The incubation period of years, the lack of detectable host immune response, the debilitating and progressive neurological illness, and the pathology localized to the central nervous system are characteristics of the disease, and are is comparable to the characteristics of other TSE diseases such as scrapie, which affects sheep and goats. In addition, the infectious agent is extremely resistant to dessication and disinfectants. Confirmation of disease is by histological examination of brain tissue collected at necropsy; the vacuolation that occurs during the disease will be symmetrical and in the gray matter of the brain stem. Molecular biology techniques, such as Western blots and immunohistochemistry, may also be used to identify the presence of the prion protein. Differentials include many infectious or toxic agents that affect the bovine nervous and musculoskeletal systems, such as rabies, listeriosis, and lead poisoning. Metabolic disorders such as ketosis, milk fever, and grass tetany are also differentials. There is no vaccine or treatment. Prevention focuses on import regulations and not feeding ruminant protein to ruminants; recent USDA regulations prohibit feeding any mammalian proteins to ruminants.",

These viral infections may be complicated by parasitic infections (e.g., Cryptosporidium, Eimeria) or bacterial infections (e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter). Treatment is aimed at correcting dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis; cessation of milk replacers and administration of fluid therapy intravenously and by stomach tube may be necessary, depending on the presence of suckle reflex and the condition of the animals. Diagnosis is by immunoassays available for some viruses, viral culture, exclusion or identification of presence of other pathogens (by culture or fecal exams), and microscopic examination of necropsy specimens. Prevention focuses on calves suckling good-quality colostrum; other recommendations for calf care are in Section II,B,5.

Neonatal isoerythrolysis may occur because of the antierythrocyte antibodies stimulated by one vaccine product. Vaccinated animals can still become infected and become carriers. The cattle vaccine has shown no efficacy in smaller ruminants, and there is no A. ovis vaccine. Identifying carriers serologically and treating with tetracycline during and/or after vector seasons may be an option. Removing carriers to a separate herd is also an approach.

Ingested zoites invade epithelial cells and eventually undergo sexual reproduction, resulting in new oocysts, which the cats will shed in the feces. Cats rarely show clinical signs of infection. One cat can shed millions of oocysts in 1 gm of feces, but the asymptomatic shedding takes place for only a few weeks in its life. Oocysts sporulate in cat feces after 1 day. Ruminants are intermediate hosts of toxoplasmosis and become infected by ingesting sporulated oocyst-contaminated water or feed. As in the definitive host, the ingested sporozoite invades epithelial cells within the intestine but also further invades the bloodstream and is transported throughout the host. The organism migrates to tissues such as the brain, liver, muscles, and placenta. Placental infection develops about 14 days after ingestion of the oocysts. The damage caused by an infection is due to multiplication within cells. Toxoplasma does not produce any toxin.",

There are three common species of flukes in ruminants of the continental United States: Fasciola hepatica, Fascioloides magna, and Dicrocoelium dendriticum. Fasciola hep\u00e1tica infections are primarily seen in Gulf Coast and western states. Fascioloides magna infections are typically seen in Gulf, Great Lake, and northwestern states, where ruminants share pasture with deer, elk, and moose. Dicrocoelium dendriticum infections occur only in New York State. Liver fluke eggs are passed in the bile and feces and hatch in 2\u20133 weeks to form the free-swimming miracidia. It is important to note that each fluke egg represents the source of eventually thousands of cercariae or metacercariae. The miracidia penetrate the body of an intermediate host (usually freshwater snails) and develop through sporocyst and redia stages, finally forming cercariae. (Dicrocoelium is unique because it utilizes a land snail that expels slime balls, each containing several hundred cercariae. These are eaten by a second intermediate host, the ant Formica fusca.) The cercariae leave the intermediate host, swim to grassy vegetation, lose their tail, and become a cystlike metacercaria. The metacercariae may remain in a dormant stage on the grass for 6 months or longer until ingested by a ruminant. The ingested metacercariae penetrate the small-intestinal wall and migrate through the abdominal cavity to the liver. There they locate in a bile duct, mature, and remain for up to 4 years.",

Chronic disease may result from fluke-induced physical damage to the bile ducts and cholangiohepatitis. Blood loss into the bile may lead to anemia and hypoproteinemia. Liver damage also is evidenced by increases in liver enzymes such as \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Persistent eosinophilia is also seen with liver fluke disease. Other clinical signs of liver fluke disease include anorexia, weight loss, unthriftiness, edema, and ascites.

The disease also occurs in Limousin cattle, humans, and some other species. In the homozygous recessive animal, symptoms of the disease may vary from mild to severe and occur at different times of the year and in different ages of animals. A reddish brown discoloration of teeth and bones is a characteristic of the disease, as is discolored urine, general weakness and failure to thrive, photosensitization, and photophobia. Bones are more fragile compared with bones of normal animals. A regenerative anemia occurs as the result of the shortened life span of erythrocytes, due to accumulations of porphyrins. The genetic defect is associated with low activity of an essential enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, in the porphyrin\u2013heme synthesis pathway in erythrocytic tissue. The ranges in the presentation of the disease are believed to be related to varying cycles of porphyrin synthesis. Porphyrins are excreted in varying amounts in the urine and the discoloration fluoresces under a Wood's lamp. Diagnosis is based on these clinical and visible signs of porphyria; skin biopsy provides definitive diagnosis. Heterozygotes may have milder symptoms.",

Displacement to the right (RDA) may be further complicated by torsion (RTA), a surgical emergency. Left displacement (LDA) is more common than RDA. Clinical signs include anorexia, lack of cud chewing, decreased frequency of ruminal contractions, shallow respirations, increased heart rate, treading, and decreased milk production. Diagnosis is based on characteristic areas of tympanic resonance during auscultation-percussion of the lateral to lateral-ventral abdomen (\u201cpings\u201d), ruminal displacement palpated per rectum, and clinical signs. Cow-side clinical chemistry findings include hypoglycemia and ketonuria; more extensive evaluations will often indicate moderate to severe electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities. DA occurs because of gas accumulation within the viscus, and the abomasum \u201cfloats\u201d up from its normal ventral location to the lateral abdominal wall. No exact cause of DA has been identified, but it is commonly associated with stress; high levels of concentrate in the diet, leading to forestomach atony; and many disorders, including lack of regular exercise, mastitis, hypocalcemia, retained placenta, metritis, or twins. Factors such as body size and conformation indicate the possibility of genetic predisposition. Treatments include surgical and nonsurgical techniques for LDA; the former has a better chance of permanent correction. Emergency surgery is necessary for RTA; the disorder is fatal within 72 hr. Recurrence is rare after surgical correction. Electrolyte and acid-base imbalances are likely in severe cases and especially with RTA. Prevention includes reducing stress, taking greater care in the introduction and feeding of concentrates, and reducing incidence of predisposing diseases noted above (Rohrbach et al., 1999).",

Factors in the development of the condition include negative energy balance related to the normal decreased dry matter intake as parturition approaches; hormonal changes associated with parturition; and concurrent diseases of parturition that decrease feed intake and increase energy needs. The possible concurrent diseases include metritis, retained fetal membranes, mastitis, parturient paresis, and displaced abomasum. Signs are nonspecific and include depression, anorexia, and weakness. Prognosis is usually guarded. Diagnosis is based on herd management, the animal's condition, ketonuria, and clinical signs. In prepartum cattle and in lactating cows, blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) greater than 1000 \u03bcEq/liter and 325\u2013400 \u03bcEq/liter, respectively, are abnormal (Gerloff and Herdt, 1999). Triglyceride analysis of liver biposy specimens are useful. In affected cows, body fat is mobilized, in the form of NEFA in response to the energy demands. Hepatic lipidosis occurs rapidly as the NEFA are converted into hepatic triglycerides. The ability of the liver to extract the albumin-bound NEFA from the blood is better than that of other tissues that need and can also use NEFA as an energy source. Treatment for any concurrent diseases must be pursued aggressively, as well as measures to increase and stabilize blood glucose, decrease NEFA production, and increase forestomach digestion to improve production of normally metabolized volatile fatty acids. Therapeutic measures include intravenous glucose drips, insulin (NPH or Lente) injections every 12 hr, and transfaunation of ruminal fluid from a normal cow. Prevention includes minimizing stress to late-gestation cows. Dry and lactating cows should be maintained separately; their energy, protein, and dry matter requirements are very different.

The condition most frequently occurs in animals that have been recently fed abundant quantities of succulent forages or grains. Bloat is classified into two broad categories: frothy bloat and free-gas bloat. Frothy bloat is associated with ingestion of feeds that produce a stable froth that is not easily expelled from the rumen. Fermentation gases such as CO2, CH4, and minor gases such as N2, O2, H2, and H2S incorporate into the froth, overdistend the rumen, and eventually compromise respiration by limiting diaphragm movement. The froth is often derived from a combination of salivary mucoproteins, protozoal or bacterial proteins, and proteins, pectins, saponins, or hemicellulose associated with ingested leaves or grain. Typical foodstuffs that cause frothy bloat include green legumes, leguminous hay (alfalfa, clover), or grain (especially barley, corn, and soybean meal). Free-gas bloat is less related to feeds ingested; rather, it is caused by rumen atony or by physical or pathological problems that prevent normal gas eructation. Some examples of causes of free-gas bloat are esophageal obstructions (foreign bodies, tumors, abscesses, and enlarged cervical or thoracic lymph nodes), vagal nerve paralysis or injury, and central nervous system conditions that affect eructation reflexes. Clinically, the animal will exhibit rumen distension, and tympany will be observed in the left paralumbar fossa. Additional signs may include colic-like pain of the abdomen and dyspnea. Passage of a stomach tube helps to differentiate between free-gas bloat and frothy bloat; and with free-gas bloat, expulsion of gas through the stomach tube aids in treatment of the disorder. Once rumen distension is alleviated with free-gas bloat, the underlying cause must be investigated to prevent recurrence. Frothy bloat is more difficult to treat, because the foam blocks the stomach tube. Addition of mineral oil, household detergents, or antifermentative compounds via the tube may help break down the surface tension, allowing the gas to be expelled. In acute, life-threatening cases of bloat, treatment should be aimed at alleviating rumen distension by placing a trocar or surgical rumenotomy into the rumen via the paralumbar fossa. Limiting the consumption of feedstuffs prone to induce bloat can prevent the disease. Additionally, poloxalene or monensin will decrease the incidence of frothy bloat.",

            "text": "Lactic acidosis, or rumen acidosis, is an acute metabolic disease caused by engorgement of grains or other highly fermentable carbohydrate sources. The disease is most frequently related to a rapid change in diet from one containing high roughage to one containing excessive carbohydrates. Diet components that predispose to acidosis include common feed grains; feedstuffs such as sugar beets, molasses, and potatoes; by-products such as brewer's grains; and bakery products. Biochemically, ingestion of large amounts of the carbohydrate-rich diet causes the normally gram-negative rumen bacterial populations to shift to gram-positive Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species. The gram-positive organisms efficiently convert the starches to lactic acid. The lactic acid acidifies the rumen contents, leading to rumen mucosal inflammation, and increases the osmolality of rumen fluids, leading to sequestration of fluids and osmotic attraction of plasma and tissue fluid to the rumen. Lactic acid-induced rumenitis predisposes the animal to ulcers, to liver abscesses from \u201cabsorbed\u201d bacterial pathogens, to laminitis from absorbed toxins, and to polioencephalomalacia from the inability of the new rumen bacterial populations to produce sufficient thiamine needed to maintain normal nervous system function. Clinically, animals will become anorexic, depressed, and weak within 1\u20133 days after the initial insult. Incoordination, ataxia, dehydration, hemoconcentration, rapid pulse and respiration, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lameness will also be noted. Rumen distension and an acetone-like odor to the breath, milk, or urine may also be observed. Diagnosis is based on history and clinical signs. Blood, urine, or milk ketones can be detected (Moore and Ishler, 1997). Additionally, rumen pH, which is normally above 6.0, will drop to less than 5.0 and in severe cases may achieve levels as low as 3.8. Similarly, urine pH will become acidic, blood pH will drop below 7.4, and hematocrit will appear to increase due to the relative hemoconcentration. Necropsy findings will be determined by secondary conditions. The primary lactic acidosis will cause swelling and necrosis of rumen papillae and abomasal hemorrhages and ulcers. Treatment must be applied early in the syndrome. In early hours of severe carbohydrate engorgement, rumenotomy and evacuation of the contents are appropriate. The patient should be given mineral oil and antifermentatives to prevent the continued conversion of starches to acids and the absorption of metabolic products. Bicarbonate or other antacids like magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide introduced into the rumen will aid in adjusting rumen pH. Furthermore, animals can be given oral tetracycline or penicillin, which will decrease the gram-positive bacterial population.",

They will frequently be dark in color, and multiple papillae will clump together. Abscessation may be observed. Histopathologically, papilla surfaces will have hyperkeratinization of the squamous epithelium. Chronic laminitis may be observed. However, diagnosis of parakeratosis is generally made at necropsy.

In addition to concentrate feeding, inadequate roughage in the diet is also associated with this disorder. Rumenitis may occur with contagious ecthyma infection or following ingestion of poisons or other irritants. Because rumenitis is often associated with lactic acidosis, it tends to occur in feedlot animals. The inflamed ruminal epithelium becomes necrotic and sloughs, creating ulcers. Endogenous rumen bacteria such as Fusobacterium necrophorum may invade the ulcers, penetrate the circulatory system, and induce abscesses of the liver. Clinically, the animals will appear depressed and anorexic. Rumen motility will be decreased, and animals will lose weight. The disease may resolve in a week to 10 days; mortality may reach 20%. Necropsy lesions include rumen inflammation and ulcers in the anteroventral sac. Granulation tissue and scarring may be observed following healing.

The complete pathogenesis of laminitis is poorly understood; however, it is thought that changes in the diet cause changes in rumen microbial populations, resulting in acidosis and endotoxemia. Dramatic changes in the vascular endothelium result in chronic inflammation of the sensitive laminae of the hoof, separation of corium and hoof wall, and rotation of the third phalanx. Affected animals may be reluctant to get up or walk, will shift their weight frequently, and will grind teeth or walk on carpi. Chronically, the hoof wall takes on a \u201cslipper\u201d appearance.

The photosensitive chemicals are usually ingested, but in some cases exposure may be by contact. Animals with a lack of pigment are more susceptible to the disease. Three types of photosensitization occur: primary; secondary, or hepatogenous; and aberrant. Primary photosensitization is related to uncommon plant pigments or to drugs such as phenothiazine, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines. Secondary photosensitization is more common in large animals and is specifically related to the plant pigment phylloerythrin. Phylloerythrin, a porphyrin compound, is a degradation product of chlorophyll released by rumen microbial digestion. Liver disease or injury, which prevents normal conjugation of phylloerythrin and excretion through the biliary system, predisposes to photosensitization. The only example of aberrant photosensitization is congenital porphyria of cattle (see Section III,B,1). Pathologically, the photosensitive chemical is deposited in the skin and is activated by absorbed sunlight. The activated pigments transfer their energy to local proteins and amino acids, which, in the presence of oxygen, are converted to vasoactive substances. The vasoactive substances increase the permeability of capillaries, leading to fluid and plasma protein losses and eventually to local tissue necrosis. Photosensitization can occur within hours to days after sun exposure and produces lesions of the face, vulva, and coronary bands; lesions are most likely to occur on white-haired areas. Initially, edema of the lips, corneas, eyelids, nasal planum, face, vulva, or coronary bands occurs. The facial edema, nostril constriction, and swollen lips potentially lead to difficulty in breathing. With secondary photosensitization, icterus is also common. Necrosis and gangrene may occur. Diagnosis is based on clinical lesions and exposure to the photosensitive chemicals and sunlight. Treatment is symptomatic. The prognosis for hepatogenous type may be guarded if hepatic disease is severe.",

Vaginal prolapses usually occur during late gestation and may be related to relaxation of the pelvic ligaments in response to hormone levels. In sheep, these are most common in overconditioned ewes that are also carrying twins or triplets. Overconsumption of roughages, which distends the rumen, and lack of exercise leading to intra-abdominal fat may predispose an animal to vaginal prolapse by increasing intra-abdominal pressure. The condition may result from excessive straining associated with dysuria from the pressure of the fetuses and/or abdominal contents on the bladder. If the prolapse obstructs subsequent urination, rupture of the bladder may occur. The vaginal prolapse can be reduced and repaired if discovered early, and techniques in small and large ruminants are comparable. The animal should be restrained, and the prolapsed tissue should be cleansed with disinfectants. Best done under epidural anesthesia, the vagina is replaced into the pelvic canal and the vulvar or vestibular opening is sutured closed (Buhner suture).

Several factors predisposing to dental wear should be considered. The diet should be properly balanced for minerals, especially calcium and phosphorus, because primary or secondary calcium deficiency during teeth development results in softening of the enamel and dentin. Dietary contamination with silica (i.e., hays and grains harvested in sandy regions) will lead to mechanical wear on the teeth. Likewise, animals grazing or being fed in sandy environments will have excessive tooth wear. Sheep older than about 5 years of age are especially prone to tooth wear and should be checked frequently, especially if signs of weight loss or malnutrition are evident. Managing the content and consistency of the diets can best prevent the disease.",
