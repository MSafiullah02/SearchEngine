Including those two samples with endpoint values >5 (Sample 1 and 2, Table 1 ), concordance between the assays would have been 92%. Importantly, in the absence of endpoint value review and further testing, a discordance rate of 23% may result in laboratories that rely exclusively on the Xpert\u00ae assay to report negative results in samples harboring low levels of viral RNA. With expansion of testing to identify pre-symptomatic patients, the number of specimens falling into this low level viral RNA range may be expected to increase, and repeat testing of negative Xpert\u00ae results may be indicated with a secondary method.",
