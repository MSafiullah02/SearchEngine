            "text": "\nC. serrata Royle (synonym; Toona sinensis (Juss.) M. Roem.) is locally known as Hill Toon, Meem and Daral in Pakistan. The plant belongs to mahogany family (Meliaceae) of flowering plants consisting of over 500 species and about 50 genera of trees and shrubs growing in the tropical and subtropical regions. (\u201cMeliaceae.\u201d Britannica Academic) C. serrata hard bark served as fuelwood and is used in construction, roofing, fencing and utensils (Ahmad et al., 2009). For agricultural purposes, this tree was the best to be intercropped in a bean/banana intercrop (Ouma, 2009). Additionally, this plant is used customary for the treatment of various diseases such as; diabetes mellitus (Jan et al., 2011; Hamayun, 2005; Yaseen et al., 2015; Awan et al., 2011; Rashid et al., 2015), diarrhea (Jan et al., 2012), fever (Khan et al., 2015) and skin infections (Awan et al., 2011). Moreover, its crude extract contains several phytochemicals, mainly Phenolics and flavonoids, having diverse pharmacological properties ranging from cytotoxic to anti-glycating activities. The plant does possess potential to be explored further, as the number of pharmacological activities and results reported for this plant may not be normalized and validated enough to consider the plant for further mechanistic and molecular level studies. Before any in-depth studies, a comprehensive data and pharmacological reports along with toxicity profile must be studied and established for C. serrata.",

Among these isolated compounds, Quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-galactoside showed greater in vitro anti-oxidant activity as compared to Kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-glucoside, confirming the superiority of Quercetin glycosides over Kaempferol glycosides in terms of antioxidant potential. Besides, these compounds showed better antioxidant activity as a mixture than pure compounds suggesting synergistic effect of these flavonoids.

Ahmad et al., using agar well diffusion method, tested methanolic extract of C. serrata leaves and bark. The methanolic fraction of the bark extract exerted in-vitro antimicrobial action against the gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis, and the gram-negative organisms: Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp and Salmonella typhi. The bark extract showed significant inhibition of Citrobacter spp growth with an inhibition zone of 22.33 \u00b1 0.05 mm at the concentration (150 \u03bcg/ml). It is suggested that C. serrata antimicrobial activity is due to its high contents of phenols present in the bark (Ahmad et al., 2013). Another study was conducted by Jan et al., evaluating the antibacterial effect of C. serrata crude extract at various concentrations (10, 20 and 30 mg/ml). Using agar well diffusion method, the crude extract of C. serrata showed an in-vitro inhibitory potential towards microbes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. Zones of inhibition were measured for different concentrations of C. serrata crude extract. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of C. serrata ethanolic fraction was 3 mg/ml for P. aeruginosa and 6 mg/ml for E. coli, S. typhi, S. aureus and P. vulgaris. According to Jan et al., antimicrobial activity might contribute to the presence of tannins, steroids and volatile oils or the presence of phenolic compounds (Jan et al., 2012). Bibi et al., reported C. serrata methanolic leaves extract in-vitro antimicrobial activity at 20 mg/ml against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas spp with a maximum zone of inhibition of 16 mm and a minimum of inhibition Escherichia coli growth. However, it showed moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Kelbsiella pneumoniae (Bibi et al., 2018). S. aureus, S. typhi, E. coli and S. flexneri are the chief infectious agents causing diarrhea in humans (Anne and Geboes, 2002). The use of C. serrata and various herbal remedies for the treatment of diarrhea is reported in different communities, especially in Pakistan (Jan et al., 2012). C. serrata showed potent antimicrobial activities against various strains of bacteria causing diarrhea. Such activity may support its community use as an anti-diarrheal agent. Additionally, C. serrata exhibited antiviral activity against of the life-threatening virus (i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Its crude tender leaf extracts exerted in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV replication with EC50 value of 30 \u03bcg/ml (Chen et al., 2008).",

Besides, the dose applied with claim to have significant result i.e. 3 and 6 mg/ml, is too high. To be considered as potent antibacterial, the extract and plant parts must possess activity at very low concentration and especially against emerging strains of bacteria where the world is endangered and posed with resistance phenomenon. The statistical tool used in the studies was improper. A proper ANOVA or t-test based data evaluation and analysis with P=0.05 should be reported to make the data reliable and significant. IC50 was observed in none of the studies and there were no MIC or MEC value reported which is of prime importance for human clinical uses.

At 24 mg/ml, the chloroform fraction of C. serrata extract showed 34.91% inhibition of F. oxysporum growth whereas the methanolic fraction showed 23.38% inhibition (Bibi et al., 2018). The methanolic fraction of C. serrata bark extract showed significant in-vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans with a IC50 value of 39.3 \u03bcg/ml, whereas the chloroform fraction of the leaves extract showed significant activity against Trichophyton rubrum with IC50 value of 25.9 \u03bcg/ml (Ahmad et al., 2013). C. albicans is reported by Robert et al., to be attributed to diarrhea caused by certain antimicrobial medications (Robert et al., 2001). Its anti-fungal activity against this strain of fungi may support the customary use of C. serrata for the treatment of diarrhea (Jan et al., 2012). The supportive data from a particular group of people is not suffcient evidence to use these plants or extracts in any fungal infection. The antifungal study here seems to be a very preliminary data and for sure a gap for more research exists in terms of evaluating the effect of these extracts on resistant as well as commonly prevailed strains and to take this research till mechanistic level where the adverse effects may be reported too. The worriyng factor here is the dose as mentioned above, this may be potentially toxic at high concentration i.e. used for human treatmnets. Thus it is very critical to develop advanced models for antifungal potential including resistant strains, low doses, proper standards as well as statistical models for comparing the data.",

            "text": "Besides its anti-parasitic activity against Leishmania spp., C. serrata exerts potent antiparasitic activity against other species of parasites including Trypanosoma spp. The n-hexane fraction of leaves extract showed potent in-vitro activity against T. brucei with IC50 value of 8.17 \u03bcg/ml, whereas the chloroform fraction of the bark extract showed even more potent activity against T. cruzi with IC50 value of 1.37 \u03bcg/ml. The n-hexane fraction of the leaves extract exhibited similar activity against T. cruzi with IC50 value of 2.24 \u03bcg/ml (Ahmad et al., 2013). The activity against parasites is interesting and significant here. However, what is the value of such extract in real practice for these parasites? This needs to be explored further. Mostly, these results vary up to a great extent when the model for treatment is changed. The same dose concentration may be easily applied in clinical trials especially in patients with leishmanial diseases. However, the risk-to-benefit ratio for the extract in terms of side effects, adverse effects, dose and therapeutic outcome is more important to make the plant as a useful and respective species in the market. It is worthy to add here, that leishmanial disease is an important field and scope of research for a number of laboratories and researchers, where they are utilizing every possible resource to find a significant and potent agent to eradicate leishmanial diseases. Despite, much work is needed to properly apply the plant in current disease. The very basic hindrance of using plant parts i.e. extracts which are treated with toxic solvents such as n-hexane and chloroform may be conisdered seriously. Most of the times it is the solvent and its resdiues which may play a cytotoxic or antiparasitic role. This may be overruled first. Literature reports suggest the very low dose of chloroform sufficient enough for death. Hence, microbes or parasites may be killed at a compratively more low doses. Likewise, none of the study reported the phytochemical or its class in the same plant responsible for such activity. More probably it may be a synergistic effcet exerted by the leaves or bark extract of the plant responsible for such activity. None of the positive or especially negative control were observed in the study in order to assure the effect was due to extract potential rather then the solvent itself. In the very case, even if these factors are overuled, still the same study needs to be applie din proper pharmcological models of cell culture techniques and in vivo models. Toxicity profile for the extracts with minimum dose selection have a key importance to apply the model in clincial studies. To overcome this, further research is essential in terms of isolation of the active chemical entity, structure elucidation and clinical trials at the level of multicenter and mutlifaceted studies. The model used for the activity with proper standards (positive and negative), underlying mechanisms, effective and safe dose, cytochrome P-450 enzymes utilized during metabolism and more importantly the interactions with other drugs needs to be defined.",

            "text": "One of the hypotheses suggested for hyperglycemia-induced vascular pathologies and diabetic end complications is increased levels of advanced glycation products (AGEs). It is suggested that AGEs are produced in case of intracellular hyperglycemia, which triggers intracellular auto-oxidation of glucose into various reactive products, which react with intracellular and extracellular proteins forming AGEs (Brownlee, 2001). Diabetic patients can be protected from glycation-derived free radicals damage using antioxidants. Compounds having combined antiglycation and antioxidant activity are reported to be more effective anti-diabetic agents. C. serrata bark extract (200 \u03bcL extract at different concentrations) showed highest in vitro activity against AGEs formation with an IC50 value of 0.61 \u00b1 0.02 mg/ml. Similarly, the leaves extract showed significant in vitro antiglycation activity with an IC50 value of 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 mg/ml. As C. serrata contains the highest contents of phenols and flavonoids in its bark and leaves, respectively, this plant's antiglycating activity may be attributed to the presence of such compounds (Ahmad et al., 2013). Additionally, the ethyl acetate fraction of C. serrata leaves extract showed significant in vitro antiglycating activity with IC50 value of 0.62 \u00b1 0.02 mg/ml. The extract was prepared by dissolving 1 mg in 3 ml as stock solutions and further three dilutions were prepared in a concentration of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 from stock solution (Ahmad et al., 2016). Having antioxidant and antiglycating activity, C. serrata could be a useful for preventing diabetic complications in diabetic patients. As mentioned above, several ethnobotanical studies reported the cultural use of C. serrata in Pakistan for the treatment and management of diabetes (Yaseen et al., 2015; Hamayun, 2005; Jan et al., 2011; Awan et al., 2011). The mentioned pharmacological studies support its use.",

The AGEs is an emerging domain where most of the researcher are on-the-way to find novel and effective source for treating glyoxal, methylglyoxal, fructose amine adducts etc. The extract of the bark from this plant may play a vital role to provide a source of AGEs inhibitors. The predictive model of its mechanism is very important to be elucidated in order to successfully utilize the plant and its chemical entities for AGEs and its related complications, especially in diabetic patients. The plant and its extract may be particularly studied for its hepatotoxicity potential as diabetic people may have co-morbidities, where the plant and its extract may not affect the liver conditions. Furthermore, the interaction of the plant extract or compounds may have lack of effect on the conventional drugs used for treating diabetes and AGEs related complications.

Besides, expanded studies in the shape of clinical trials are intensively needed to treat effectively the very emerging and prevalent disease of AGEs. With respect to antioxidant activity, a number of questions do exists. Generally, all the plants and its extracts possesses antioxidant activities due to commonly occurring flavonoids and phenolic compounds. First of all, the presence of an antioxidant potential does not guarantee a valid or authentic activity always. Especially for those studies where the protocols involves merely a competitive bleaching of probe (Crocin bleaching assay, ORAC assay), reaction with different probe (TOSC assay) or indirect methods for reduction or oxidation of persistent radicals (DPPH, TEAC, FRAP etc.). An extensive data is available where the researcher claims an antioxidant potential based on aforementioned protocols. In fact, these models are not reproducible pharmacologically when applied in vivo or in human models. Current study is one of such examples. It is very interesting to see the antioxidant and antiglycating potential for this plant, however, data at such level is very na\u00efve and preliminary for any conclusion. The debate regarding antioxidant potential always exists as every plant and its extract have some phenolic and flavonoid moiety imparting antioxidant potential to plants.

This compound has shown its activity against DU145 prostate cancer cells via different mechanisms including; mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DU145 cells growth at G2/M phase (Chen et al., 2009). Additionally, C. serrata crude leave extract has shown in vitro cytotoxic activity against lung cancer. The crude leave extract induced the activation of caspase-3-like proteases enzymes leading to apoptosis of A549 cells. Also, the extract showed anti-proliferative activity through the interferance with cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression (Chang et al., 2002). Similarly, the phenolic components of C. serrata leaves showed antiproliferative and apoptotic activity against human premyelocytic leukemia (HL-60 cells). Phenolic components of C. serrata exerted their apoptotic activity against HL-60 cells through various mechanisms including; caspase 3 activation, release of cytochrome c, specific proteolytic cleavage of PARP, also known as poly ADP-ribose polymerase, generation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2) and reduction of Bcl-2 levels (Yang et al., 2006) (Kakumu et al., 2014).

Halogenated solvents are well known for toxicity and death even at very low solvent ratio. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies does not involve such solvent for data generation. It is better to perform such activities using DMSO in allowed and specified concentration.

Proper pharmacological and toxicological guidelines are available where the toxicity potential is studied in in vitro experiments first. Following in vitro experiments the extracts are studied animal toxicity models using histological and immunohistochemistry studies. Hence, the plant needs much attention on this aspect as the data may not justify its cytotoxic and hence it's further use as an agent for the treatment of cancer. The very preliminary cell culture studies may decide a track for this plant extract, whether to utilize and study it for further anti-cancer studies. The simple cytotoxicity potential may not be sufficient to put the plant in the list of cancer treatment drugs.",

The plant finds extensive custom uses for diabetes and hypertension as well as liver diseases and dysentery. Moreover, these studies were supported by the pharmacological activities performed for various parts of the plant in different solvents. These studies establishes a preliminary role for C. serrata as an antioxidant for liver diseases, antimicrobial for dysentery and inhibitor of advanced glycation products i.e. glyoxal, methylglyoxal and fructose amine adducts during diabetes. Although a potential role may be assumed for the plant at this stage, these activities lack a major gap before application into human systems. These gaps include; lack of data showing the confirmation of these pharmacological activities in human subjects i.e. volunteers or patient's models, unavailability of mechanistic study for pharmacological activities, absence of any phase-0 to V studies where the micro dose and therapeutic/sub-therapeutic dose, as well as the toxicity and adverse effects associated with plants use, may be concluded. Proper positive and negative controls alongwith duration and dose of extracts applied is required especially in the case of antioxidant assays as discussed in detail previously. Moreover, the active moieties isolated and reported are very few and mostly they are reported compounds. None of the novel hit or lead compound has been reported so far from this plant. In addition, the already isolated compounds were not further studied for any toxicity, or clinical studies so to make a proper dosage form of the drugs from the plant and market it for the availability of end user. There were no in vivo pharmacological studies or clinical trials held for C. serrata till date and www.clinicaltrials.org correspondingly does not report any clinical trials for C. serrata or any of its parts, extract or isolated known compounds. Even, the secondary metabolites isolated, as reported, may be explored further for its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties as well as side effects and toxicity in clinical trials, so that they may be converted into potential marketed drug moieties.",

This may be a good chance for researchers to apply the plant and its extracts in mentioned activities as well as to report the toxicity profile for the plant in animal models. Currently, very limited studies have reported these biological effects and detailed studies on toxicity, side effects at various doses as well as with long-term use are highly needed to address underlying mechanism for aborting inflammation, analgesia and CVS related disorders. There is a plethora of evidences where hepatic toxicity associated with the use of conventional or crude drugs is reported due to perturbation of the immune system. It is of vital interest to investigate the possibility of acute and/or chronic liver damage following ingestion of this plant extracts containing alkaloids and flavonoids in natural herbal extracts. For the very reason, anti-inflammatory, CVS, analgesic and therapeutic effect of this plant may be studied in chronic hepatitis, cholestasis, drug-induced autoimmunity, vascular lesions, and hepatic fibrosis animal models. Besides, lack of evidence exists for C. serrata extracts interactions with cytochrome P-450 enzyme i.e. in case the compounds in extract binds covalently with these enzymes, a possibility may exist whereby T-cells are activated and cytokines may release thus leading towards a complicated immune response. The foremost important phenomenon is to observe the effect with the conventional drugs available for the mentioned pharmacological activities or diseases such as NSAIDs, antihypertensive, diuretic, etc. The synergistic or antagonist effects for such drugs when used concomitantly with C. serrata extracts or its phytochemical are of prime importance for achieving a successful Pharmaceutical care model, hence further clinical trials with multicenter and multifaceted population are of key importance here.",

Similarly, few compounds were isolated and tested in respective diseases whereby they showed some basic mechanism of antioxidant, free radical entrappers, cytotoxic, bacteriostatic/bactericidal and glycation of products in diabetes. The mechanisms studied so far includes traditional basic level protocols involving merely a competitive bleaching of probe (Crocin bleaching assay, ORAC assay), reaction with different probe (TOSC assay) or indirect methods for reduction or oxidation of persistent radicals (DPPH, TEAC, FRAP etc.). Advanced level with reproducible and valid results such as cell-based antioxidant assays are much needed to resolve the phenomenon of antioxidant potential in plants. C. serrata has enormous potential to be worked on further. The area of interest for researcher may include; isolation of lead compounds as well as the compounds due to which current plant have a potential respect in treatment of diseases in a number of communities, specific compounds to have establish role of being antidiabetic, antihypertensive as well as useful for liver disease, pharmacological activities with mechanistic potential in order to explore the proper mechanism of these extracts or pure compounds in treatment of diabetes, hypertension and liver diseases, toxicity determination of the herbal extract and isolated compounds in different preclinical and clinical in vivo systems, clinical trials for the herbal products and isolated compounds at various stages including Phase-0 to V as well as translating the pre-clinical data in to clinical studies and finally conversion into a suitable dosage form in order to be used in common population. The plant has the potential to be studied further and maybe an interesting species to attract researchers for future studies. The authors supported the presence of many pharmacological activities based on phenolic and flavonoids compound, present in this plant. In most of the cases, the phenolic and flavonoids compounds are reported with in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial and antidiabetic potential. It is mandatory to confirm the source and nature of such compounds, concerning structure, in C. serrata plant. The compound with mentioned activities may be previously reported in other species as well as advanced studies may be possibly being conducted by some other researchers. To decide regarding the ethnopharmacological and phytochemical relevance as well as the importance of the plant, such compounds may be isolated and reported whereas in case of novel compound more in-depth and molecular target-based studies are urgently needed to produce a new drug for health related purposes.

The toxicity of C. serrata was reported by few ethno-medicinal surveys, yet no toxicity cases were reported. About 11 compounds were isolated from C. serrata ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts. Few quantitative phytochemical analysis studies were conducted exploring this plant's active phytochemicals. However, its flavonoids and phenolic compounds got several researchers' attention. The flavonoids predominantly existed in C. serrata leaves whereas the Phenolics predominantly existed in its bark. Two classes of flavonoids were identified; Quercetin and Kaempferol glycosides. Moreover, eight phenolic acid compounds were identified (e.g. Ferrulic acid, Caffeic acid, o-Coumaric acid, etc.).

C. serrata bark extract showed the strongest inhibition of AGEs formation suggesting that C. serrata phenolic content is attributed to this activity as well. C. serrata in vitro cytotoxic activity has been an area of interest for many researchers and its activity was established on various types of cell lines. This article aimed to provide good insights for reviewers to understand C. serrata potentials to be studied further and explored in depth. As this plant showed some therapeutic potentials in modern in-vitro studies hence more in vivo and advanced studies with pharmacologically reproducible and valid models consisting of proper dose, duration and frequency of extract applied, controls used in study and molecular mechanisms are needed to enroute the plant towards isolation of active chemicals and establish their pharmacological activities for clinical trials. The more important and hot area of research nowadays is herb-drug interactions, as most of the people prefer to use natural products i.e. herbs while using conventional drugs. There remains a possibility of interactions, whether may be inductive or inhibitive. However, these effects need to be explored for any plant or its extract if they claim to possess pharmacological activity.
