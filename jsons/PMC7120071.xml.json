            "text": "Cell fusion is a phenomenon combining genetic and epigenetic information between two different types of cells, resulting in the creation of a new cellular phenotype and function. Fused cells can grow as polynuclear cells, called heterokaryons. In other cases, one combined nucleus is formed through cell division after cytoplasmic membrane fusion. The phenotype of hybrid cells varies depending on the combination of parental cells for fusion. Specialized gene products from one of the parental cells are maintained; others are often extinguished via a tissue-specific repressive mechanism, a phenomenon called extinction (1). Thus, it has been believed that epigenetic information derived from parental cells coordinately regulates the new phenotypes and functions of somatic hybrid cells.",

The union of two pronuclei from an MII oocyte and sperm creates the next generation with genetic diversity. Soon after fertilization, sperm chromatin is reprogrammed by nucleoplasmin because of the exchange of sperm-specific basic proteins to histones (2), almost resulting in the equalization of paternal and maternal chromatin through subsequent cell divisions. Cell fusion is also involved in the technique of animal cloning. The somatic donor nucleus is introduced into a recipient MII oocyte by cell fusion or direct injection. In the cloned embryos, the somatic type of cell phenotype and function is reprogrammed to the pluripotential type as a result of genomewide epigenetic modifications via the activity of trans-acting factors preserved in unfertilized oocytes. This phenomenon has been called nuclear reprogramming.",

            "text": "Using electrofusion between ES cells and adult somatic cells, it has been demonstrated that ES cells have an intrinsic capacity for the nuclear reprogramming of specialized somatic genomes (3,4). In hybrid cells of ES cells and thymocytes, epigenetic modifications specific to somatic cells are fully reprogrammed to the ES epigenotype, as shown by (1) the successful contribution of the ES hybrid cells to the normal embryogenesis of chimeric embryos, (2) reactivation of the inactivated X chromosome derived from female thymocytes, (3) reactivation of pluripotential cellspecific genes (Oct4 and Tsix) derived from somatic cells, (4) tissue-specific gene expression from the reprogrammed somatic genomes after in vivo and in vitro differentiation, and (5) de-condensed chromatin formation in the reprogrammed somatic nuclei as marked by histone-tail modifications of H3 and H4 hyperacetylation and H3 lysine 4 hypermethylation (3,5,6). Moreover, embryonic germ (EG) cells derived from gonadal primordial germ cells of mouse E11.5 and 12.5 embryos, in which the majority of parental imprints are erased (7), possess additional activity for inducing reprogramming of parental imprints on somatic genomes accompanied by DNA demethylation in the EG hybrid cells (8). Therefore, electrofusion between pluripotential stem cells and somatic cells will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming involved in epigenetic modifications on DNA and chromatin.",

Since Harris\u2019s group reported cell fusion between two different species, mouse and human, in 1965 (10), the technique has proven to be a powerful approach to analyzing biological interactions between differentiated cell types. Various techniques lead to cell fusion mediated by other viruses such as Paramyxoviruses, including Oncornavirus, Coronavirus, Herpesvirus, and Poxvirus and by treatment with various chemical agents such as calcium ions, lysolecithin, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). However, virus- and chemicalmediated cell fusion has difficulties with respect to the efficiency of inducing cell fusion and reproducibility and biomedical safety for clinical applications. Since the 1980s, efforts have been made to optimize many parameters of electrofusion, resulting in improvements in fusion efficiency, which is now significantly better than that of cell fusion with polyethylene glycol (11). The electrofusion parameters, however, were optimized for making hybridomas for the stable production of antibodies.\n",

The electrofusion procedure is subdivided into several parts: (1) cell culture of ES and fused cells; (2) pretreatment of somatic cells; (3) setup of the Electro Cell Manipulator (ECM) 2001 (BTX), AC (alternating current)/DC (direct current) pulse generator with a Microslide chamber; (4) operation of the electrofusion generator; (5) selection of postfusion cells; and (6) isolation and cloning of fused cells. In the process of electrofusion, AC pulses induce the alignment and compression of the cells, and DC pulses transiently make revertible pores in cytoplasmic membranes to initiate the process of fusion among cells. The alignment voltage, pulse length, and electroporation voltage and the number of DC pulses should be precisely controlled.\n\n",

Consequently, ES cells hybridized with the thymocytes can survive and grow only in medium supplemented with a protein synthesis inhibitor, G418. The ES hybrid cells and their derivatives are visualized as cells positive for X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside) staining, which allows one to observe their contribution in chimeric embryos and tissues (3,5,8).",

The somatic cell-derived Hprt gene rescues the HPRT activity in the hybrid cells. In DNA synthesis, the purine nucleotide can be synthesized by the de novo pathway and recycled by the salvage pathway. When electrofusion-treated cells are cultured in medium with HAT (hypoxantine, aminopterin, and thymidine), the de novo pathway is interfered with, and only the salvage pathway functions. As a consequence, the Hprt-deficient ES cells die; ES hybrid cells are able to survive and grow (5,66).",

The pearl chain formation is mainly influenced by cell density and contamination from cell debris, serum, or salts in mannitol buffer. Do the following to improve the conditions:\nPellet the mixed cells by centrifugation and resuspend the cells in a suitable amount of fresh 0.3 M mannitol.Increase the cell density if pearl chains are poorly formed.Decrease the cell density if cell movement is disturbed.Total cell volumes in 0.3 M mannitol have to be carefully controlled to obtain a smooth electric current.
