            "text": "Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit a wide range of viruses (reviewed in (Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Perreira et al., 2013)). Humans have five IFITMs including IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 among which IFITM1, 2 and 3 exhibit antiviral activities (Hickford et al., 2012). These three IFITMs are ubiquitously expressed in different tissues, and respond to type I interferon stimulation. IFITM5 is strictly expressed in osteoblasts and has a role in bone mineralization (Moffatt et al., 2008). The function of IFITM10 remains unknown. Many important human pathogenic viruses are sensitive to IFITM restriction. These include influenza A virus, flaviviruses, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, Rift Valley fever virus, reovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), etc. (Anafu et al., 2013, Brass et al., 2009, Huang et al., 2011, Jiang et al., 2010, Lu et al., 2011, Mudhasani et al., 2013). The importance of IFITM proteins in host antiviral defense is demonstrated by the high mortality of ifitm3-knockout mice infected with influenza A virus and by the possible association of an SNP in the human ifitm3 gene with the disease severity caused by influenza virus infection (Bailey et al., 2012, Everitt et al., 2012, Wakim et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "IFITMs are small transmembrane proteins containing 120 to 135 amino acids (Siegrist et al., 2011). IFITM2 and 3 share higher homology as compared to IFITM1, which has a relatively shorter N-terminal region and a longer C-terminal region. IFITM proteins have two predicted transmembrane (TM) domains. However, recent data suggest that only the C-terminal TM domain of IFITM3 crosses the membrane, whereas the N-terminal one serves as an intramembrane domain (IMD) (Bailey et al., 2013, Jia et al., 2012, Yount et al., 2012). This IMD likely associates with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer with the help of palmitoylated cysteine residues (Yount et al., 2012). This type of membrane topology allows the cytoplasmic exposure of a large portion of IFITM sequences that may interact with cellular factors and machineries that collectively modulate the functions of IFITMs. One example is the 20-YEML-23 motif of IFITM3 that interacts with the adaptor protein AP-2 and regulates IFITM3 endocytosis from the plasma membrane en route to late endosomes (Chesarino et al., 2014, Jia et al., 2012). The K24 residue of IFITM3 is a major site of ubiquitination. This modification affects IFITM3 subcellular localization and antiviral activity (Yount et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The IFITM proteins inhibit virus infection by impairing virus entry (Feeley et al., 2011). Two models of inhibition have been proposed. One model suggests that IFITM proteins interfere with membrane hemifusion (Li et al., 2013). This model is supported by the results that IFITM proteins suppressed cell membrane hemifusion that was created by low pH at cold temperature. This inhibition was rescued by oleic acid that promotes membrane hemifusion (Li et al., 2013). The second model proposes that IFITM proteins impede the formation of viral fusion pore (Desai et al., 2014). In support of this latter model, no effect was detected on lipid mixing between viral membrane and endosomal membrane upon IFITM3 overexpression. Yet, the release of viral genome into the cytoplasm was blocked by IFITM3 (Desai et al., 2014). Both models are consistent with the notion that IFITM proteins can modulate the biophysical property of lipid bilayer, such as membrane fluidity and curvature, through mechanisms that possibly involve the interaction of IFITMs with VAPA and the disruption of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013). In support of this mechanism, a cholesterol-binding agent amphotericin B overcomes the inhibition of influenza A virus infection by IFITM3 (Lin et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In order to evaluate the susceptibility of different primate lentiviruses to inhibition by IFITM1, 2 and 3, we selected the following viruses for study, including three HIV-1 strains (the laboratory adapted strain NL4-3, primary isolate YU-2 and the circulating recombinant form A/G), one HIV-2 strain (HIV-2Rod), five SIV strains from chimpanzees (SIVCPZ1.9), African green monkeys Chlorocebus sabaeus (SIVAGM-sab) and Chlorocebus tantalus (SIVAGM-tan), rhesus macaques (SIVMAC-1A11) and sooty mangabeys (SIVSMM). Since these viruses either use CXCR4 or CCR5 as the co-receptor, we chose to infect the HIV indicator cell line TZM-bl that expresses both CXCR4 and CCR5 and are thus susceptible to infection by all these viruses. We first transduced TZM-bl cells with retroviral vectors expressing human IFITM1, 2 or 3 and selected the stably transduced cell lines with puromycin. Ectopic expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was confirmed by western blotting (\nFig. 1A). We then challenged these TZM-bl cell lines with different doses of HIV or SIV. Virus infection was monitored by measuring luciferase activity that was expressed under the control of HIV-1 LTR promoter in TZM-bl cells. The data report the effect of IFITM proteins on the early phase of HIV/SIV infection until viral Tat protein is produced. Fig. 1B shows the luciferase activities of one representative infection experiment that was performed with different doses of viruses. The averages of three independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 1C. The results showed that SIVAGM-tan was inhibited the most, whereas infection of HIV-1, SIVCPZ1.9 and SIVMAC were not profoundly affected by the three human IFITM proteins. On the basis of the degrees of inhibition, these primate lentiviruses are ranked as SIVAGM-tan>SIVAGM-sab, SIVSMM, HIV-2Rod>HIV-1NL4-3, HIV-1YU-2, HIV-1A/G>SIVCPZ1.9 and SIVMAC. The results also revealed that IFITM2 was the most inhibitory, followed by IFITM3 and IFITM1.",

            "text": "Since IFITM proteins are known to inhibit virus entry (Feeley et al., 2011, Lu et al., 2011), we asked whether the strong inhibition of SIVAGM by IFITM2 is a result of impaired virus entry. To this aim, we prepared the BlaM-Vpr-containing HIV and SIV particles, and used these virions to infect IFITM-expressing TZM-bl cells. The efficiency of virus entry was determined by measuring the cleavage of CCF2 by BlaM-Vpr that enters the cytoplasm together with viral cores. The results showed that the entry of HIV-1NL4-3 and SIVMAC into TZM-bl was marginally affected by IFITM1, 2 or 3 (\nFig. 2). In contrast, the entry of SIVAGM-tan and SIVAGM-sab, to a lesser extent SIVSMM, was strongly impaired by IFITM2 and IFITM3 (Fig. 2). This similar reduction in the entry of SIVAGM-tan and SIVAGM-sab contrasts with a moderately stronger inhibition of SIVAGM-tan infection by IFITM2 and 3 as shown in Fig. 1. This difference suggests that SIVAGM-tan may be inhibited not only at the entry step, but also at a downstream step until viral Tat is produced, which is measured in the assays shown in Fig. 1.",

Both SIVAGM-tan and SIVAGM-sab showed significantly higher infection in the IFTIM2/3-knockdown cells (Fig. 3B). Since the BlaM-Vpr containing SIVAGM-sab particles generated much stronger signals in the entry assay than SIVAGM-tan (Fig. 2), we further measured the effect of IFITM2/3-knockdown on the entry of SIVAGM-sab. We also treated TZM-bl cells with IFN\u03b12b to increase the expression of endogenous IFITM2 and 3. The results showed that IFN\u03b12b reduced the entry of SIVAGM-sab by 2-fold and this diminution was completely lost when IFITM2 and 3 were depleted with shRNA (Fig. 3C and D). When the endogenous IFITM2 and 3 were knocked down in a human T cell line called C8166 that constitutively express relatively high level of IFITM2, the entry of SIVAGM-sab increased by approximately 50% (Fig. 3E\u2013G). IFN\u03b12b treatment increased the expression of IFITM2 and 3, and results in a 40% reduction in SIVAGM-sab entry. Depletion of IFITM2 and 3 under IFN\u03b12b treatment restored SIVAGM-sab entry to the control level (Fig. 3E and F). We also observed that shRNA3 depleted IFITM2 much more efficiently compared to shRNA1 and shRNA2 (Fig. 3E), which correlates with a moderately greater entry of SIVAGM-sab in shRNA3-transdued C8166 cells than in shRNA1- or shRNA2-transduced cells, albeit that this increase does not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3F and G). Together, these data indicate that endogenous IFITM2 and 3 inhibit the entry of SIVAGM-sab.",

            "text": "It has been reported that amphotericin B prevents IFITM3 from inhibiting influenza A virus through modulating membrane fluidity (Lin et al., 2013). We suspected that, if IFITM2 and 3 use the same mechanism to inhibit SIVAGM and influenza A virus, then amphotericin B should also rescue the infection of SIVAGM in IFITM2/3-expressing cells. Indeed, when amphotericin B was added with increasing doses, the infection of both SIVAGM-sab and SIVAGM-tan in IFITM2 or IFITM3-expressing TZM-bl cells were restored to the level of infection in control cells (\nFig. 4A and B). HIV and SIV are known as pH-independent viruses (McClure et al., 1988). Yet, the high sensitivity of SIVAGM to IFITM2 and 3 inhibition raises the possibility that this SIV may have become pH-dependent similar to the influenza A virus. Contrary to this speculation, SIVAGM showed resistance to the treatment of chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 both of which neutralize the pH in late endosomes and thus inhibit VSV G protein-mediated pH-dependent virus entry (Fig. 4C). In further support of this observation, the dynamin inhibitor dynasore moderately stimulated the infection of SIVAGM (Fig. 4D), which suggests that, in contrast to VSV that enters the cell via endocytosis and is thus sensitive to dynasore treatment, the entry of SIVAGM is independent of endocytosis. Together, these data indicate that IFITM2 and 3 exploit a similar mechanism to inhibit viruses that enter cells via different pathways.",

            "text": "We next asked whether SIVAGM is inhibited by IFITM proteins of its natural host, African green monkeys. To answer this question, we first cloned IFITM1 and IFITM3 from the African green monkey kidney cell lines called COS-7 and Vero. The agmIFITM1 exhibits a much higher homology to macaque IFITM1 than to IFITM1 of humans and chimpanzees (\nFig. 5A). Similar to human IFITM1, agmIFITM1 exhibited no or only weak inhibition of HIV or SIV (Fig. 5B). Four agmIFITM3 sequences were identified that differ at amino acid positions 22 and 38 (Fig. 5A), no distinct agmIFITM2 sequence was found. All four agmIFITM3 proteins inhibited HIV and SIV, with SIVAGM-tan and SIVAGM-sab being the most inhibited (Fig. 5B). The agmIFITM3 appears to elicit a much stronger inhibition than human IFITM2 or IFITM3 (Fig. 1), which might have enabled agmIFITM3 to suppress the infection of SIVAGM-tan and SIVAGM-sab to similar low levels. The differences at amino acid positions 22 and 38 affected the antiviral activity of IFITM3, agmIFITM3(I22H38) elicited the strongest inhibition (Fig. 5B). Notably, the I22 residue is located within the 20-YEML-23 motif that directs the endocytosis of human IFITM3 (Chesarino et al., 2014, Jia et al., 2012, Jia et al., 2014). This may explain the effect of M22I change on the antiviral function of agmIFITM3. Since SIVAGM is potently inhibited by both human IFITM2 and agmIFITM3, it is likely that SIVAGM is much more susceptible to IFITM restriction than other HIV and SIV strains regardless of the species origin of the IFITM proteins.",

Some viruses are strongly inhibited, examples are influenza A viruses, flaviviruses, Ebola viruses, and SARS coronaviruses (Brass et al., 2009, Huang et al., 2011). Some are moderately inhibited, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (Weidner et al., 2010). Some are resistant to IFITM, including LCMV, MACH, LASV, MLV, papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus and adenovirus (Brass et al., 2009, Warren et al., 2014). Infection of human coronavirus OC43 is even stimulated by IFITM2 or 3 (Zhao et al., 2014). Results of our study showed that members of the same virus family such as lentiviruses can be affected by IFITM proteins to markedly different degrees that range from virtually no inhibition of SIVCPZ1.9 and SIVMAC to a 10-fold restriction of SIVAGM by human IFITM2.",

            "text": "This observation appears to mirror the species-specific antiviral activity that has been described for some host restriction factors such as tetherin (Sauter et al., 2009). Human tetherin does not inhibit HIV-1 because of the countering action of viral antagonist Vpu, but it can block the release of SIVAGM. In a similar vein, African green monkey tetherin potently inhibits HIV-1 owing to the inability of HIV-1 Vpu to antagonize this monkey tetherin. However, our results showed that agmIFITM3 inhibits SIVAGM more potently than human IFITM2 does, which suggests that SIVAGM may have not been sufficiently pressured to escape from the agmIFITM3 restriction. It is known that, in contrast to HIV and SIV infections that cause AIDS, SIVAGM or SIVSMM infection of their natural hosts is not pathogenic, which is at least partially attributable to the rapid resolution of innate immune responses at the acute infection stage and the lack of chronic immune activation (Harris et al., 2010, Jacquelin et al., 2014). Therefore, after establishing the infection, SIVAGM or SIVSMM does not face the inhibition by interferon and ISGs including IFITM proteins. In the absence of selection by interferon, SIVAGM or SIVSMM may, in theory, develop any level of sensitivity to IFITM proteins. It is therefore not a surprise that SIVAGM is more restricted by IFITM3 compared to SIVSMM.",

In other words, neither of the two copies of macaque ifitm3 genes has changed significantly enough to become a distinct ifitm2 gene as seen in humans and chimpanzees. It is possible that in different primate hosts, the ifitm3 duplicate have undergone different levels of selection and as a result, exhibit different levels of divergence.

We further confirmed the pH-independent nature of SIVAGM by showing its resistance to chloroquine and BafA1 both of which neutralize the pH of late endosomes. We also observed that SIVAGM infection is refractory to dynamin inhibitor dynasore, which suggests that SIVAGM does not need endocytosis to enter cells. Since both SIVAGM and influenza A viruses are potently inhibited by IFITM proteins, it is evident that the routes of virus entry do not necessarily determine the susceptibility of viruses to IFITM restriction. Since the cholesterol-binding compound amphotericin B counters the inhibition of SIVAGM and influenza A virus by IFITMs, IFITM proteins likely utilize the same mechanism to change the membrane fluidity at the virus entry portals and thus block viral membrane fusion.",

(A) The BlaM-Vpr-containing viruses were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with pBlaM-Vpr DNA and each of the HIV-1NL4-3, SIVAGM-tan, SIVAGM-sab, SIVMAC or SIVSMM DNA. These viruses were then used to infect TZM-bl cell lines that stably express IFITM1, 2 or 3. Virus entry was determined by measuring the cleavage of CCF2 by BlaM-Vpr.

Three shRNA clones targeting both IFITM2 and 3 were transduced into TZM-bl cells with or without IFN\u03b1-2b treatment (1000 U/ml, 16 h). Levels of endogenous IFITM2 and 3 were assessed by Western blotting. (B) Effect of endogenous IFITM2 and 3 on the infection of SIVAGM-sab and SIVAGM-tan. IFITM2/3-knockdown TZM-bl cells were first treated with IFN\u03b1-2b and then infected with SIVAGM-sab or SIVAGM-tan. Viral infection was determined by measuring luciferase activities in the infected TZM-bl cells. Results of three independent experiments are summarized in the bar graph with the infection of control TZM-bl cells arbitrarily set as 100%. (C) Effect of endogenous IFITM2 and 3 on SIVAGM-sab entry in TZM-bl cells. BlaM-Vpr-containing SIVAGM-sab was used to infect the IFITM2/3-knockdown TZM-bl cells. Levels of virus entry were assessed by measuring the cleavage of CCF2 using flow cytometry. (D) The results of three independent virus entry experiments are summarized in the bar graph.
