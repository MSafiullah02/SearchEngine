One probable scenario suggests that COVID-19 cases outside of China might spread and remain undetected for a relevant time period, resulting in delayed countermeasures in many countries. In fact, new current disease epicenters have formed in Italy, Japan, South Korea and Iran.",

Hence, by means of this study, we will analyze whether there is any indication of underreported COVID-19 cases in countries with a lower HAQ vs. higher HAQ-Index countries. We will compare the amount of COVID-19 cases in both groups by distinguishing the relation of non-travel associated COVID-19 cases vs. those with travel history to China.

Interestingly, most unidentified cases in these countries are not associated with travel history to China. This study is the first to investigate the role of unidentified COVID-19 cases with respect to the virus' spread pattern. Despite limited data and constantly changing case numbers available at the time of analysis, our findings indicate that despite enormous efforts launched by China to contain COVID-19 spread, there is a significant danger of a continuous undetected spread of COVID-19 cases. It is possible that, at later stages, multiple COVID-19 epicenters appear in developing countries as seen by the latest explosion of case numbers in Iran. This development in countries without sustainable medical surveillance can give further rise to both local and global virus outbreaks. In this case, despite continuous restrictions in air traffic, shipping, or other means of transportation, COVID-19 might further establish itself as a pandemic, especially since this virus shows exceptionally high transmission rates and structural stability on surfaces.5\n,\n6 With only limited data available, results must be evaluated with caution. We also want to emphasize that results cannot be generalized. There will be exceptions to this depending on the local situation. For example, Taiwan has many more imported than locally transmitted COVID-19 cases but has also performed extensive laboratory studies among both groups of patients with and without travel background to China. Other reasons for potential increasing COVID-19 case numbers might be because infected travelers from China may have traveled to developed countries earlier as well as more frequently than to developing countries. This could have facilitated local spread much earlier than was detected, considering the incubation time of 7\u201314 days. Furthermore, developed countries more often hold international conferences and meetings with Chinese participants, another aspect which could have facilitated the spread of COVID-19. In these cases, conference participants would not be classified as individuals with travel background to China. All in all, our findings further support concerns of a continuous global COVID-19 spread.",
