The role of active transport as part of daily routines, for example, has excited considerable interest for its potential for reducing pathologies associated with sedentarism, overweight and obesity, in journals and at international meetings (Lyn and Sallis, 2018). These have stimulated interest and built closer ties between researchers and practitioners.",

This system of \u201cautomobility\u201d (Sheller and Urry, 2000; Beckmann, 2001; Urry, 2004) has placed cars at the centre of transport and city planning and, ideologically, made them a key measure of freedom, social progress and economic development. Automobility plays out very differently, however, in the Global South, where cars clog the roads but are accessible to only a minority of the population, due to widely disparate levels of wealth and income. These issues make sustainable mobility and health central to equity and the social sustainability of transport in diverse and sometimes hard to identify ways.",

As the virus struck Latin American cities, Bogota's local government expanded Ciclovias, making the cycle routes a permanent part of city streets to promote social distancing, while in Santiago some mayors were closing parks, but leaving malls open for business as usual. How the health-transport links identified to date are put to work in this new environment, amidst the additional challenges of climate and global change, requires expanding on existing research and applying increasingly sophisticated analyses that can help policy-makers and civil society define the best ways forward for each particular place. These challenges also highlight opportunities to make cities more resilient, by paying more attention to health-transport links and their potential to drive positive change.",
