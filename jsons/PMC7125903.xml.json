            "text": "There are at least 48 species of virus that infect dogs, but only about half are considered to cause clinical problems, and fewer than 10 of these are regarded as important pathogens of dogs. These are canine herpesvirus (CHV), infectious canine hepatitis virus (canine adenovirus type 1: CAV-1), infectious canine laryngotracheitis virus (canine adenovirus type 2: CAV-2), canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), rabies virus, and canine coronavirus (CCoV). Of these, CAV-1, CPV-2 and CDV cause serious infections with high mortality, especially in non-immune puppies, and therefore vaccines against these infections are regarded as \u2018core\u2019 vaccines for dogs. Vaccination against these pathogens is widely practiced throughout the world. Non-core vaccines include those for CHV, CPIV and CCoV, and are essentially optional.",

CAV-2 vaccination provides immunity against infectious canine hepatitis caused by CAV-1 because of their shared immunogens. In practice, canine vaccination starts in pups as young as 4 weeks of age, and puppies have to receive several injections until 3 months old, both because these pathogens are ubiquitous, and residual high levels of maternally derived antibodies may inhibit immunization. It is recommended that thereafter dogs should have a booster vaccination with an appropriate interval. For reviews of canine vaccination, see ref. [1].",

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has traditionally been used in cell cultures for vaccine production, and it is now widely recognized that FBS, serum components such as albumin, and other proteins of animal origin are not only the cause of such adverse events but may also be the source of adventitious microbial contaminations. Nuisance contaminants are generally fungi, bacteria, viruses, microbial nucleic acids, and more specially the prion of bovine spongiform encephalopathy [2]. Consequently, there is a requirement for a method of growing viruses without the use of animal proteins.",

The difference may relate to the host cell activity shown in Fig. 1. The parental MDCK cells grew faster than the MDCK-SP cells under the present experimental conditions. It is well known that actively dividing cells are required for efficient replication of parvoviruses, and the same is true for CPV-2. The cellular DNA polymerase that is expressed only in mammalian cells during the S phase of the cell cycle is an essential factor for parvovirus replication [15]. Thus, it may be necessary to devise methods for obtaining the virus fluid with higher titers; for example, making use of a higher m.o.i. and of higher cell density in a smaller volume of medium, or of the parvovirus efficient culturing method [3] as applied for the preparation of the stock seed CPV-2 (Table 1).",
