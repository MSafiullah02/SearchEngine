            "text": "There is a Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic, which originated in Hubei Province in China. There is evidence of community transmission throughout the world, including Australia. Infection can cause severe acute respiratory illness, but there is a spectrum of disease ranging from mild to severe symptoms. 1 To help reduce the incidence of COVID-19, quarantine measures have been implemented in Australia. These measures are changing rapidly. People who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and people who have travelled from, or who have transited through, affected areas are required to quarantine for 14 days. People who are tested for COVID-19 include those who have symptoms of the disease, such as fever, or acute respiratory infection (e.g. shortness of breath or cough), with or without fever, and have either travelled, or transited through, a country considered to pose a risk of transmission in the 14 days before illness onset, or have had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the 14 days before illness onset. 2 Routine population screening is currently being conducted in some areas, however it has not been mandated by the Commonwealth. The Australian Commonwealth Government has recently announced Australian border closures, with some State Governments also shutting borders to domestic travelers. This is in addition to new social distancing measures, and the closure of non-essential services, 3 in response to the continued growth of COVID-19 within the community. 4 The RFDS is one of the largest aeromedical services in the world, 5,6 with 77 aircraft and 140 healthcare vehicles, located across its 23 Australian bases. 7 In 2018/19, 370,706 patient contacts were made through RFDS clinics, aeromedical transports and telehealth consultations. At the same time, there were 82,081 road transfers. 7 The RFDS deals with respiratory and infectious diseases routinely. However, COVID-19 presents challenges in terms of potential volumes of patients needing care and the impacts it has on organisational capacity. Since identification of COVID-19 within Australia, the RFDS has been transporting patients with confirmed COVID-19 and those who have developed symptoms after being in a high risk situation. This has included cases from the cruise ship",

If mass infection occurred in rural and remote towns, it could have dire outcomes. This is due to rural and remote populations having higher rates of respiratory disease than their major city counterparts, as well as higher rates of other chronic diseases. 12, 16 Specifically, rural and remote populations are also more likely to suffer poorer outcomes of respiratory disease, including bronchiectasis. 17 COVID-19 directly affects the lungs and patient's ability to breathe, with severe cases requiring oxygen therapy via a respirator. 16 Furthermore, many remote communities have high proportions of Indigenous Australians, 18, 19 and higher levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. 20 The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is significantly lower than non-Indigenous Australians, with Indigenous Australians more likely to suffer from many chronic diseases at a younger age, including type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. 21 As such, in the event of mass infection, it is vitally important that we develop care strategies for mild COVID-19 patients in rural and remote areas, including dedicated COVID-19 clinics or in-situ field hospitals (or similar). Another strategy would be to increase the use of RFDS telehealth platforms.",

This included data on all patients who underwent an aeromedical retrieval for diseases of the respiratory system (coded in Chapter 10 of the ICD-10-AM) between 01 July 2015 and 30 June 2019 (4-years). Patient data was collected within flight and included the patient's sex, age, and self-reported Indigenous status (See",

The designed and validated DES model was subsequently used in a full factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate the system's performance under various scenarios, combining individual levels of supply of RFDS services and the potential COVID-19 related demand. The factors included in experimental design were: number of aircraft available within the operational command area, as well as daily rates of potential additional COVID-19related demand in patients with respiratory system disease for different priority categories.",
