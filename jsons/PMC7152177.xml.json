Gatherings can be short term (for a few hours as in a sporting event or concert) or longer (for several days to weeks, as in the Olympic Games or the hajj). A gathering can be held at one location or spread over different sites. The sizes of mass gatherings vary. For example, there were around 3.4 million spectators during the FIFA World Cup in Brazil in 2014; the hajj pilgrimage usually attracts some 2 million Muslims each year; the Hindu pilgrimage Kumbh Mela in India can attract up to 130 million pilgrims. There is no consensus on a threshold of the number of people that constitute a mass gathering.",

Heat/meteorologic conditions may trigger heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and/or accidents due to lightening. Overexertion may result in dehydration or severe cardiovascular events.

Saudi Arabia has developed a comprehensive program, which is updated annually to ensure that all aspects of hajj rituals are conducted safely and without major incident.17 The inevitable overcrowding in a confined area of such large numbers increases the risk of respiratory infections. The hajj has historically been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal disease, with a major outbreak of serogroup A occurring in 1998.4, 5 In response to this outbreak, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia introduced vaccination against serogroup A as a hajj visa requirement. In 2000 and 2001 outbreaks of meningococcal disease due to W135 serogroup were reported, including a high acquisition rate of W135 meningococcal carriage.18 Returning pilgrims with W135 carriage triggered various clusters of W135 meningococcal disease in household contacts.19 Tetravalent meningococcal vaccine covering A, C, Y, and W135 became a mandatory hajj visa requirement in 2002, and no further hajj-related outbreaks occurred. The Saudi Ministry of Health also introduced eradication of meningococcal carriage through administering single-dose antibiotics to pilgrims arriving from the African meningitis belt. Monitoring carriage states of visitors and local inhabitants in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as the implementation of preventive measures that impact carriage, are warranted to reduce the risk of hajj-related and umrah-related meningococcal disease outbreaks.20\n",

For example, shaving heads during the hajj was reported to increase the risk of hepatitis B, slaughtering of animals during the hajj was associated with Orf and Rift valley fever, stoning rituals were associated with accidents, and walking barefoot resulted in severe sole burns.16 A large proportion of hajj pilgrims are older adults, many with preexisting illnesses that may be aggravated by heat or exertion. Overcrowded conditions during the mass migration from one ritual event to the next led to many deaths due to stampede. The most recent one occurred at Hajj 2015 with more than 2000 victims.24\n",

For those traveling from areas where wild poliovirus is still circulating, polio vaccination 4 weeks prior to departure should be given. Yellow fever vaccination should be given for those traveling from yellow fever\u2013endemic countries to countries where Aedes mosquitoes exist. Furthermore, the importance of being immune against measles cannot be overemphasized, particularly in light of declining vaccine coverage rates in some countries, highlighting that routine immunizations should be up to date. If prolonged crowding conditions are to be expected, quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine may be indicated. The quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is a hajj visa requirement.
