            "text": "The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), also known as novel coronavirus pneumonia, first occurred in Wuhan, China in early December 2019. Within 2 months, it had spread all over the world and caused 77,059 confirmed infections, with 2446 fatal cases, in China by 24 February 2020 [1, 2]. The SARS-COV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pathogen shares similarities with SARS-CoV in its genome sequence, biological behavior, and clinical manifestations [2\u20135]. It has four major structural proteins: the spike surface glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein [3, 6]. The spike protein binds to host receptors via the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7]. The ACE2 protein has been identified in various human organs, including the respiratory system, GI tract, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain [8]. The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [5]. SARS-COV-2 is believed to be more transmissible than SARS-COV [9].",

The tissues were received fixed in neutral buffered formalin for over 24 h, and then routinely processed under standard biosafety measures. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were prepared and slides were examined by two pathologists (SFT and SYX). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed in a liver specimen from Case 1, who had a history of CLL. It was used to verify subsets of the small lymphocytes found in portal tracts, using antibodies against CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, CD4, and CD8 (Agilent Technologies, US). All antibodies were used in prediluted form, and IHC was performed using the automated Leica Bond-Max instrument.",

Cases 1, 2, and 3 showed hyaline membrane formation and vascular congestion, suggesting an acute-phase component (Fig. 3a\u2013c). Occasionally, these were mixed with scant inflammatory cells. In addition, Case 1 exhibited pneumocyte injury with focal sloughing and formation of syncytial giant cells (Fig. 3a). There was also focal lymphocytic infiltration that likely represented her history of CLL. Case 2 exhibited no prominent inflammatory cellular infiltration (Fig. 3b), and Case 3 exhibited focal interstitial thickening (Fig. 3c). Case 4 showed more advanced changes. In addition to remnants of hyaline membranes in some airspaces, large areas of intra-alveolar hemorrhages and intra-alveolar fibrin cluster formation were observed nearby (Fig. 3d). In addition, the alveolar wall contained increased stromal cells, fibrin, and infiltration by mononuclear inflammatory cells. Together with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, these led to interstitial thickening (Fig. 3e). Fibrinoid necrosis of the small vessels was noted as well (Fig. 3e, inset). In this patient, there was also evidence of consolidation by abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with bronchopneumonia of a superimposed bacterial infection (Fig. 3f).",

Mild thickening of alveolar walls is also evident in some cases, suggesting a more advanced stage. However, mature fibrosis is not seen. A common feature of the chest radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia is GGO, which may represent an early exudative phase of COVID-19 pneumonia. With advancing disease, consolidation occurs in severely ill patients, likely due to intra-alveolar organization by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix formation, and interstitial thickening. In some patients, the radiographic consolidation may be caused by massive intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, likely due to superimposed bacterial pneumonia. These were identified in Case 4, who had a longer clinical course of 52 days. Previously, we identified pathological changes in resected lung specimens of two pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, including edema, proteinaceous exudate, and focal hyperplasia of pneumocytes with only patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and the absence of hyaline membranes [13].

In contrast, specimens included in the current study were obtained 1 h after death, largely avoided postmortem degenerative changes.

Therefore, no autopsies could be performed on patients who died of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak. Autopsies were later permitted to be performed under stringent biosafety regulations, but in Wuhan, there is a shortage of autopsy labs meeting these requirements. Faced with these challenges, we sought for alternatives such as the postmortem biopsies used in this study. This method was also used by another team from Beijing at around the same time [12]. We recognize that due to limited sampling in needle core procedures, studies using postmortem biopsies carry certain limitations. For example, RT-PCT showed direct evidence of the viral sequence in the liver in only one of three cases tested. This may be due to either limited test sensitivity or sampling problem. Because Wuhan is still under lockdown, technical services remain very limited. Rather than working up a protocol optimized for FFPE tissue, a PCR kit designed for pharyngeal swabs was used instead. Second, there is a possibility of RNA degradation, which is common in clinical samples, particularly when specimens are not immediately stored in a transfer medium suitable for preserving RNA. Hopefully, future studies will be able to avoid these challenges and provide a more complete picture of the viral distribution in different tissues.",
