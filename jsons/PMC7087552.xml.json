            "text": "The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Most of the initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but person-to-person transmission was established quickly while viral transmission prior to the appearance of symptoms remains controversial [2, 3]. From the same family as the SARS and MERS coronaviruses (10% and 35% fatality rates respectively [4, 5]), 2019-nCoV has also led to serious cases of pneumonia, albeit with a lower estimated fatality rate of 2-3% at the present time [6]. Given that a vaccine cannot be developed and deployed for at least a year, preventing further transmission relies upon standard principles of containment, two of which are the isolation of known cases and the quarantine of persons believed at high risk of exposure (with the latter extended inside China to prevent travel to or from Wuhan, and globally via the cancellation of air travel to and from China).",

While it was not possible to pinpoint exact dates of infection, the dates at which symptoms in both infectees and (presumed) infectors occurred were determined, and the difference in these dates taken as a proxy for the elapsed time since infection of the infector (see [7] for technical issues that arise from this approach).

Using both leads to an infected person being detected at the minimum of the time a person self-detects due to symptoms and the time a person would be identified via contact tracing. The expected number of infections prevented then follows from Eq. 6 after substituting the probability density for the minimum of the two detection times. To illustrate, assume independence between self-identification and contact-tracing detection times, that self-identification occurs at twice the incubation time, contact identification times follow b(t) as previously, and quarantine/isolation is unlimited in duration. The associated \u03b2IQ denoting expected infections averted via isolation and quarantine now equals 1.64, which reduces the reproductive number from 2.26 to 0.62, well below the epidemic threshold.",

One important suggestion is that people should receive flu shots, for in addition to protecting against influenza, vaccination would reduce the number of false positive 2019-nCoV cases reported since fewer people would have the common symptoms of both flu and coronavirus, and if a vaccinated person did get sick, it would raise the probability that the case is coronavirus as opposed to flu and make it more likely said person would seek care [13]. There are other practical aspects to explore, including the development of a less-precise but more rapid diagnostic mechanism, determining how long one can safely delay ill patients with symptoms from coming to the hospital to help alleviate congestion, and figuring out how quickly Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (negative pressure units) can be created by hacking the ventilation system in ordinary wards to increase isolation capacity [14].",
