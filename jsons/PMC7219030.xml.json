We believe this launch comes at a critical time, as the response to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) consumes government, public health and clinical resources. But what does this mean for vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs)?",

This will likely reduce community transmission of many VPDs. But lockdown will also present a huge challenge for general practitioners (GPs) and community healthcare to deliver immunisations to 2020 birth cohorts, initiate catch-up campaigns with older cohorts and deliver immunisations to at-risk groups. Household isolation and COVID-19 illness in families with new-born children, combined with disruption to vaccine supply, healthcare staffing shortages and enhanced infection prevention procedures, are likely to significantly reduce opportunities for timely delivery of routine immunisations.",

The fall in MMR vaccine coverage has been followed by large outbreaks of measles, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases globally in 2019, more than in any single year since 2006 [3,4]. While spring and summer 2020 are anticipated to be accompanied by a lower incidence of many VPDs, possible further declines in routine vaccine uptake in 2020 birth cohorts may surpass recent years, and thus generate a record number of susceptible children. If lockdown ends, social distancing relaxes and formal schooling returns before, or during the 2020/21 autumn and winter season, then outbreaks of diseases such as measles, pertussis, and rotavirus gastroenteritis appear inevitable.",

This is clearly the appropriate public health approach, but the practicalities of delivering immunisations under the strain of the COVID-19 outbreak will inevitably lead to unintended drops in vaccine coverage.",
