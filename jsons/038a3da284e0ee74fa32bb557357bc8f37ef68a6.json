            "text": "30 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, double-stranded DNA tumor viruses carried by diverse 31 vertebrates. PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, 32 with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed 33 short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the 34 horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese 45 horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with 46 each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of 47 positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis 48 indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of 49 PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of 50 inter-family host-switching events of PyV in mammals and challenge the prevailing evolutionary 51 paradigm for strict host restriction of mammalian PyVs. 52 53 Author summary 54 Since the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been 55 considered both genetically stable and highly host-restricted in their mammalian hosts. In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of 67 PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other 68 DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans. 69 71 Bats (order Chiroptera) account for more than 20% of mammalian species with > 1,100 known 72 species in > 200 genera worldwide [1]. These diverse mammals harbor numerous highly virulent 73 viral pathogens, including rabies virus [2], Marburg virus [3], Ebola virus [4], Nipah virus [5], 74 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus [6-8] and the newly identified 75 swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus [9]. Spillover of viruses from bats to humans or 76 domestic animals can give rise to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [10]. 77 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses containing a circular and 78 highly stable double-stranded DNA genome [11, 12]. PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation 79 in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15]. 80 Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the 81 family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and 82 classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine 83 floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17]. PyVs are highly host-specific in different 86 mammalian species, and long-range host jumps leading to productive infection and transmission 87 within mammalian genera are considered rare or nonexistent [17, 18]. Recently, an intra-host 88 divergence model with contributions from viral lineage duplication, recombination and, 89 potentially, host-switching at evolutionary timescales has been proposed to explain the extant 90 diversity based on the available genetic data [17]. 91 Currently, 15 alphapolyomaviruses and 10 betapolyomaviruses have been formally recognized 92 in insectivorous and frugivorous bat species within the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia 93 (Indonesia) and the Pacific (New Zealand) [19-26]. These studies identified significant diversity 94 and high positive rates (10-20 %) using PCR-based approaches [27]. PyVs with complete or 95 partial genomes has also been identified by metagenomic analyses in bats collected in China and 96 recently from Saudi Arabia [28-30]. Investigation of PyVs in African insectivorous and 97 frugivorous bats [25, 26] has revealed evidence for short-range host-switching events of PyVs in 98 horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) following identification of nearly 99 identical viruses (99.9% at the genomic level) in Rh. blasii and Rh. simulator [26]. 100 In the present study, we have characterized the diversity and genetic relationships of novel 101 PyVs from a large number of insectivorous and frugivorous bat samples collected in diverse 102 ecological environments in China, resulting in the identification of inter-family host-switching 103 events in these bat-borne PyVs. The findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of intra-host PyV 104 diversification in their mammalian hosts and extend the knowledge of PyV genetic diversity, 105 evolution, host restriction and host-switching. 106 107 Results 108 Sampling information and detection of polyomaviruses. 109 In 2015-2016, a total of 1,083 bats belonging to 20 species in 6 families (Rhinolophidae, 110 Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) were 111 collected from 29 different colonies (colonies 1-29 in Fig 1 and S1 Table) from five provinces in 112 southwest (Yunnan and Guangxi), southeast (Fujian and Zhejiang) and northwest (Xinjiang) 113 provinces in China.

To test whether the host-switching events of the PyV species occurred after the divergence of 314 host species, the times to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of both bat hosts and the PyVs 315 were estimated employing a Bayesian approach. As shown in Fig 5A, species-specific polymorphisms. Importantly, these polymorphisms were found to be present in [38].

Additionally, since there is a dearth of commercially available, standardized 469 bat cell lines for isolation and identification of bat-borne viruses there are now added options to 470 establish immortalized bat cell lines from many bat species by using LTAg genes cloned from 471 divergent PyVs identified in specific Chinese bat species. At present, the Tb1 Lu cell line derived 472 from the free-tailed bat (Tardarida brasiliensis, family Molossidae) is currently the only bat cell 473 line available in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Nr. CCL-88) [51]. Recently, 474 however, Banerjee et al. [52] have reported immortalization of primary bat kidney cell lines from 475 the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, family Vespertilionidae) which were stably transformed by a 476 plasmid harboring a little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, family Vespertilionidae) PyV LTAg. The 477 ability to establish cell lines from different tissues of diverse bat species and to make these 478 available to researchers is a prerequisite for replication studies, virus-host interactions and new 479 virus discoveries. 480 Papillomaviruses (PVs), which are closely related to PyVs and share similar properties such 481 as, high genetic stability and strict host specificity, have been shown to cause transient and 482 potentially cross-species infections. Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. [53] reported that PVs do not follow strict 483 host restrictions in free-ranging Iberian bats (Eptesicus serotinus, family Vespertilionidae), as 484 they found evidence of host-switching events between two different bat species (E. serotinus and 485 E. isabellinus). They therefore recommended a revised paradigm of strict host specificity in PVs 486 [53]. 487 The findings presented here have possible implications for the study of zoonotic transmissions 488 involving highly virulent viral pathogens in bats. For example, horseshoe bats within the family 489 Rhinolophidae have been found to harbor genetically diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome 490 (SARS)-like corona viruses, which acted as major reservoirs for spillover of SARS coronavirus 491 to humans [7]. The Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has similarly been 492 associated with severe disease and lethal respiratory infections, mostly in Saudi Arabia. Likely 493 transmitted via dromedary camels, it has been shown to be closely related to several bat 494 coronaviruses, including those sequenced from species within the family Vespertilionidae 495 (Neoromicia capensis, Pipistrellus abramus and Vespertilios uperans) [54]. Recently, swine 496 acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) coronavirus has been associated with high morbidity and 497 mortality in pig populations in Guangdong province, China in close proximity to the origin of the 498 SARS pandemic, and striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in 499 geographical, temporal, ecological and etiological settings exist [9]. We consider noteworthy that 500 in the present study we identified host-switching events of the normally highly host-restricted 501 PyVs within the bat families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. Whether this reflects a greater 502 propensity for host-switching in these bat families when compared with others and what 503 mechanisms are involved require further functional studies. Conceivably, given the high 504 prevalence we and others have detected of bat PyVs, co-infection of bat species within the 505 families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae may affect the prevalence and/or transmission of 506 CoVs and other high virulent pathogens in bats.

The best-supported solution also suggested that the lineage of Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 had given rise to Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1.

The tMRCA analysis transmitted from Rhinolophus bats to A. stoliczkanus bats for a long period of time, had co-evolved with A. stoliczkanus and, finally, had formed a novel PyV species. In addition to these observed host switching events, the tMRCA estimation and correlation analysis showed least in bats, is not as rare as previously thought.An issue raised by the present study is how to define and name a PyV species when estimation. All these findings suggest that host-switching of PyVs has occurred not only in different bat species but also at different time points in different geographical locations. The host species in the naming scheme: for instance, species belonging to BFDV have been classified as Aves polyomavirus 1. This naming scheme could also be expanded using the more descriptive host species, as with the mammalian PyV species. So far, PyVs with host-switching events have only involved two host species, illustrating the limited ability of PyVs for transmission between different mammalian hosts. Therefore, the improved naming scheme of novel PyVs with host-switching events proposed here would include the binomial names of both host species; e.g., hosts, indicating that the \u2265 15% cut-off in LTAg gene identity for species demarcation is perhaps no longer adequate and should be updated to \u226510%.

Due to the complexity of the PyV-related reads detected by the viral metagenomic analyses, the PyV-specific nested PCR protocol [69] based on the VP1 gene developed byJohne et al. in 2005 [27]  was employed to screen all metagenomic samples, and partial VP1 amplicons were cloned and bidirectionally sequenced by standard methods. In addition, the PCR was expanded to screen genomic DNA extracts from rectal tissues of bats collected from other Chinese provinces.Genomic DNA from each bat tissue sample was extracted manually using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR screening employed the PCR master mix (Tiangen) with the following thermocycling conditions: 45 cycles for both outer and inner PCRs with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 46\u00b0C (outer PCR) or 56\u00b0C (inner PCR) for 30 s or 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, with ddH 2 O as a negative control. Positive PCR amplicons were purified by gel extraction (Axygen) and sequenced directly on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Genewiz) to confirm homology to PyVs and then ligated into vector pMD-18T (TaKaRa) and used to transform E. coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells 593 (Tiangen). Four clones from each VP1 amplicon were picked for Sanger sequencing. GenBank accession numbers of 192 partial PyV VP1 sequences are showed in S3Table.Oligonucleotide primers for inverse PCRs for amplification of the 5 kb PyV genomes were design based on the partial VP1 sequences. Multiple pairs of hemi-nested degenerate primers were subsequently designed for VP1 clusters which showed close phylogenetic relationships (seeS6 Table). All ~5 kb products were amplified from bat genomic DNA by inverse PCR employing the PrimeSTAR MAX DNA polymerase (Takara), purified by gel extraction (Axygen), cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and bidirectionally sequenced by primer walking to Phred quality scores > 30 by 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Genewiz). After removal of vector sequences, the full genomes of each PyV were assembled by Geneious software using the partial VP1 and 5 kb products.A real-time PCR (qPCR) method (S6Table)was established based on a 59 nt fragment of the VP1 genes of Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus XJPp02 and Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus",

The nucleotide sequence of host cytb, the sequences of PyV genes and proteins were aligned using MAFFT under the algorithm FFT-NS-i [71]. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using MrBayes v3.2, with 10 6 generations chains to ensure < 0.01 standard deviations between the split frequencies and 25% of generations discarded as burn-in [72], as described previously [73]. For the LTAg multiple-sequence alignment, a mixed substitution model was used to explore the best substitution model when inferring the topology. On the other hand, the best fitting nucleotide substitution models for host cytb and the PyV LTAg coding sequence alignments were chosen with MEGA7 [74] by choosing the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC).The tMRCA for hosts and viral samples were estimated with Bayesian analyses conducted as 625 4 independent MCMC chains of 10 million generations each, sampled every 1,000 generations(BEAST v2.4.6 [75]).
