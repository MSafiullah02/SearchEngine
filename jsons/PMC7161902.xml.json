Three domains (I, II, and III) have been mapped to elicit neutralizing antibodies where domain I (130\u2013150 aa) is located in the N terminus of the S1 subunit; however, specifics of the neutralization mechanism remain unknown.7 Domain II contains the 318\u2013510 aa RBD, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies.7, 8 Domain III includes the 1,143\u20131,192 aa HR2, which can be neutralized by disturbing HR1\u2010HR2 interaction.9 The receptor\u2010binding domain of the S protein is a primary target for subunit vaccine development.8, 10, 11, 12 According to one report, RBD protein expression in mammalian cells elicits a more potent neutralizing antibody response than RBD protein expression in Escherichia coli or insect cells.10 In addition, glycosylation residues adjacent to the RBD protein have been shown to affect neutralizing antibody titers.11 S protein RBD is considered a key function domain for receptor binding and contains neutralizing epitopes,13 including one at the N terminus of the S protein and the other near HR2.14 Residues 1,143\u20131,157 in HR2 have been identified as a 15\u2010residue epitope that is recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.9\n",

In a third study, researchers intramuscularly injected a DNA vaccine containing codon\u2010optimized truncated S protein (1\u20131,242) into BALB/c mice. They observed a strong T\u2010cell response (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against S protein), neutralized antibody production, and a greater than 106 reduction in virus replication in the lungs of vaccinated mice in response to SARS\u2010CoV challenges.17\n",

A recombinant baculovirus\u2010expressed S protein containing only the ecto\u2010domain or a His\u2010tagged full\u2010length version has been found to elicit high titers of SARS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice.4 S protein antigenicity is characterized by 38 monoclonal antibodies and three neutralizing epitopes (12\u2013327 aa, 318\u2013510 aa, and 528\u2013635 aa).5 A truncated S protein (248\u2013680 aa) fused with an N protein fragment (321\u2013422 aa) has been shown to provide post\u2010challenge protection from virus replication in mice.19 With the exception of the full\u2010length S protein, the RBD region is the major target for developing protein subunit vaccines. Fusion proteins containing RBD and human IgG1 Fc can induce highly neutralizing antibody response.8 When compared with recombinant RBD expressed in 293T cells, Sf9 cells, and E. coli, rRBD expressed in 293T cells is capable of eliciting stronger immune responses.10 Furthermore, rRBD deglycosylated by PNGase F shows a lower neutralizing antibody response.11 According to these findings, rRBD expressed in mammalian cells is (i) capable of correct folding and glycosylation and (ii) more antigenic. CHO cells have therefore been used to establish cell lines that stably express rRBD.12\n",

The intron addition significantly enhanced STR2 protein expression.20 STR2 protein contains RBD and two other neutralizing epitopes, suggesting that it is capable of inducing more neutralizing antibodies than the rRBD antigen alone.21 In this study, we obtained stable CHO cell clones using dhfr\u2010directed gene amplification, because the weaker dhfr gene promoter generally results in more copies following MTX selection.22 Accordingly, for gene amplification, we constructed two expression vectors, one containing the IRES\u2010driven dhfr gene (ISID) and one containing the SV40\u2010driven dhfr gene (ISIZ). We selected clones that expressed high\u2010level STR2 and analyzed differences in gene amplification and amplified gene stability between the two vectors, thereby generating stable CHO cell clones for subunit vaccine development against SARS\u2010CoV.",

Single cell cloning from a total of 48 stable clones was conducted and examined for the STR2 expression by western blotting. Sixteen clones showing high\u2010STR2 expression from ISID\u2010transfected cells and another sixteen clones from ISIZ\u2010transfected cells were selected for dhfr\u2010mediated gene amplification. These clones were passaged into six\u2010well plates for MTX selection. MTX was a folate antagonist to inhibit DHFR protein. MTX concentration was gradually increased from 0.02\u20130.08 to 0.32\u20131.0 \u03bcM. To adapt the increasing concentration of MTX, the dhfr gene in the transfected cells would be amplified accompanying STR2 gene amplification. The gene amplification process is shown in Figure 4. Stable clone selection at each MTX concentration required 2\u20133 weeks of effort, with recovery time generally ranging from 1.5 to 3 weeks, though longer in some cases. Cells required more time to recover at higher MTX concentrations; ISID cell clones needed more recovery time than ISIZ cell clones. Five ISIZ\u2010transfected clones and three ISID\u2010transfected clones survived following treatment with 1.0 \u03bcM MTX. Surviving cell clones at each MTX concentration were collected (in the same quantities as cells collected during MTX selection) and analyzed by western blotting for STR2 expression. The results indicate that all ISID (Figures 5A and 6) and ISIZ (Figures 5B and 6) clones experienced increases in STR2 expression during MTX selection. Although ISID clone survival rates were lower than for ISIZ clones (3/16 vs. 5/16), average STR2 expression levels were higher in the ISID clones.",

CD CHO Medium is a chemically defined medium that contains no proteins, hydrolysates. EX\u2010CELL\u00ae CHO DHFR\u2212 medium is an animal component\u2010free medium that contains recombinant human insulin, plant hydrolysates, and other organic compounds. The definition of robust cell growth was based on single passage assay. After adaption of the cells to serum\u2010free media, the same amount of cells were seeded and maintained in each medium. After 3\u2010day serum\u2010free cultures, the amount of the cells was calculated to show better growth using EX\u2010CELL\u00ae CHO DHFR\u2212 medium compared with CD CHO medium (data not shown). As CHO cells grew more robustly in the EX\u2010CELL\u00ae CHO DHFR\u2212 medium, we chose it for subsequent analyses. ISID clones 6, 9, and 62 and ISIZ clones 22, 40, and 51 were individually suspended in 35 mL of EX\u2010CELL\u00ae CHO DHFR\u2212 medium. With the exception of 51, the cell densities of all clones increased within 5 days and decreased on day 6 (Figure 9A). Cells from each clone were collected on day 5 for western blot assays. Our results indicate no change in STR2 glycoform (\u223c115 kDa) in the serum\u2010free medium, meaning that stable clones expressing STR2 are capable of adapting to serum\u2010free and suspension cultures without altering the post\u2010translational modification process (Figure 9B).",

CHO cells were used as host cells in this study because they are capable of amplifying target genes following dhfr gene amplification, thus increasing productivity. Therefore, we used a CHO/dhFr\u2212 cell expression system to establish stable amplified cell lines that were capable of producing proteins exhibiting proper folding, assembly, and post\u2010translational modification.22 We established several amplified cell clones that produced more recombinant STR2 protein than unamplified cells, depending on the individual clone. The gene amplification process requires considerable time, meaning that highly variable antigens are not suitable for amplification. According to one recent study, the S proteins of SARS\u2010CoV strains are very stable,23 and therefore, generating stable CHO cell clones may be considered a good platform for developing SARS\u2010CoV subunit vaccines.",

After MTX selection, the numbers of dhfr copies of both ISID and ISIZ clones increased at various levels, depending on the individual clone. With the exception of ISIZ clone 51, numbers of dhfr copies of ISID clones were generally greater than of ISIZ clones, and STR2 expression in ISID clones was stronger than in ISIZ clones. The exception of ISIZ clone 51 may be due to the random integration into the genome at transcriptionally less active sites. These results confirm that the weaker dhfr gene promoter generates greater gene amplification, which in turn enhances STR2 expression. According to one recent report, a weaker promoter driving dhfr gene expression can increase amplification range.22 Another research team used a weak herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV\u2010tk) promoter to construct a dhfr\u2010amplifiable vector,24 and a third used a novel approach using RNA interference to suppress dhfr gene expression.18 It is possible to enhance gene amplification by combining RNAi and weak promoters, but doing so makes the process more difficult and requires even more time to establish stable and amplified cell clones.",

The major form of STR2\u2010expressing CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells had molecular weights of \u223c115 kDa, which were sensitive to endo H treatment. A 130 kDa endo H\u2010resistant glycoprotein was also detected during transient transfection; this glycoprotein showed a N\u2010glycan pattern that favored Golgi complex processing20 (Figure 3A). During the stable clone selection and gene amplification processes described in this report, STR2 had variable glycoforms, molecular weights ranging from 88 to 115 kDa, and a 115 kDa (as opposed to 130 kDa) amplified form (Figure 5). During our experiment, we observed that the STR2 glycoform depended on cell density in terms of adhesion culture. The molecular weight of STR2 may be smaller than 115 kDa when cell confluence reaches 100%. Too high\u2010cell density would result in increased ammonia in the medium, which comes from cellular metabolism or chemical decomposition of glutamine. It was reported that increased concentration of ammonia in the medium could increase heterogeneity of glycoproteins produced by CHO cells.25, 26, 27\n",
