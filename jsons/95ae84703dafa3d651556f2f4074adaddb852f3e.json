Highlights \uf0b7 How to integrate environmental concerns into Chemical Engineering education \uf0b7 University education in Sustainable Developent through two case studies \uf0b7 Human waste can be managed to obtain energy, fertilizer and improve sanitation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 \uf0b7 Mathematical Optimization is used in this context and explained for nonspecialists Abstract Given the damage that the natural environment suffers from human activities, it is relevant to provide ecological literacy to all Chemical Engineering students. Sometimes, this information is offered through elective courses and/or seminars and consequently it might not reach the whole class. Some courses have more obvious connections to environmental issues, while others do not appear to. In this paper, we aim to show through some solved examples how to introduce an environmental topic in the subject",

The context is that of improving the sanitation and hygiene in areas of the developing world, while simultaneously creating job opportunities within the communities. The research that we have conducted for finding the proper way to address the environmental analysis in class, led us first to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but later on, other theories such as the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) have proven to be more comprehensive and therefore, better. We believe that this multidisciplinary paper shows how to integrate environmental concerns and understanding in the Chemical Engineering curricula.",

According to (Bonnett, 2010) , it is important to provide environmental education to avoid that students effectively become just process operators that perpetuate business as usual, causing serious environmental problems.",

            "text": "What we are witnessing is that in general only interested students receive some information through elective summer programs, elective courses or by voluntary attendance of seminars outside the standard contact hours. A different approach that would reach the whole class and not just the interested students would be ideal. This is the main intention of this paper. Given its characteristics, it is easier to include environmental topics in certain courses while it may seem to be less easily done in other subjects. For instance, including environmental issues in Mathematical Optimization does not seem to be obvious; but we will show that it is possible through contextualizing the tutorial problems. These problems can be given with just the essential information (bare-bone) to proceed straightaway to the required calculations, or they can be transformed in a way that the same mathematical problem is given with an environmental context that can motivate class discussion. Goals (SDGs) for the progress of the world to 2030 (UN, SDGs web). These Goals intend to represent who we want to be in a decade from now. According to the UN (UN, SDGs web), there is an urgent call for action by all countries, therefore, educators at all levels, including universities (Sarabhai, 2016; SDSN_Australia/Pacific; UNESCO, 2017) , have a critical role to play in the achievement of these goals. That said, (Kopnina, 2016 (Kopnina, , 2018 (Kopnina, , 2020 show concern for the outcomes of applying just the SDGs because these assume Nature as a commodity that can be used as a resource or as an ecosystem service; therefore, analyzing environmental problems through the Goals might induce environmental and social unsustainability. According to this author, these Goals somehow justify business-as-usual by assuming that it is possible to disconnect the link between Nature resource consumption and economic growth. Because there is a biophysical limit to growth (Rees, 2020) , these Goals can aggravate the environmental problems by excluding nonhuman species that will lead to more biodiversity loss, pollution, climate change and inevitably social tensions. Instead of using the SDGs, this author advocates to use circular economy and Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) theory (Kopnina, 2019; McDonough and Braungart, 2002) . C2C theory roughly means the opposite of what we are doing at present: producing goods that have a life cycle from cradle to grave. The bottom line is to produce goods bearing in mind the whole cycle of the materials involved. The concept of waste must disappear; according to (McDonough and Braungart, 2002) there are two types of waste: biological waste that can be integrated in the biological cycle and technical waste that should not abandon the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 technical cycle. The whole point is to guarantee that \"waste = food\", like Natural cycles do.",

The academic solved problems presented here deal with human waste management in the context of informal settlements in a developing country. This waste can cause serious health problems if not dealt with properly (Barberton, 2016; Taing et al., 2013) . An almost universal way to \"get rid\" of human waste is by using flush-toilets connected to a water-flushed network of sewers. This solution is lately being under debate (Baz et al., 2008; Troy, 2008) because of the vast amount of potable water being flushed through the toilet (EPA) and the associated stress to the ecosystem.",

These digesters are considered to be environmentally friendly devices to obtain clean energy from waste (Morgan et al., 2017) . When biodegradable waste is fed to anaerobic bio-digesters, it simultaneously produces valuable biogas and organic fertilizer with multiple positive outcomes (Ding et al., 2012) . Many anaerobic bio-digesters constructed all over the globe, use cattle manure as feed material. There is little reported research on biodigesters fed with human excreta, but that which is published is positive (Andriani et al., 2015; Col\u00f3n et al., 2015; Dahunsi and Uranusi, 2013; Ding et al., 2012; Mudasar and Kim, 2017; Muralidharan, 2017; Owamah et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2017) . The use of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 human waste has become a topic of renewed interest in the context of energy generation since it is an abundant renewable source of energy that has a negative environmental impact if not treated properly (Mudasar and Kim, 2017) .",

These dry toilets are equipped with removable cassettes that enables collection and transport of waste in a hygienic manner (Holmlund and Windh, 2018) . The bottom-line behind these problems is to send the collected cassettes to centralized bio-digesters for the provision of energy to public buildings like schools or hospitals. These multidisciplinary problems are very useful for introducing environmental concern to Chemical Engineering students because they have the potential to bring interesting debates to the classroom. Some of the issues that can be tackled are: (a) the importance of human waste management, (b) the significance of using potable water for getting rid of such waste, (c) the relevance of anaerobic biodigestion dealing with biological waste and (d) the applicability of mathematical optimization in solving logistic problems, etc. The discussion can then go as far as talking about what is an \"ecocentric worldview\" where humans, non-humans, entire ecosystems etc., have moral value (Washington et al., 2018) . This line of thinking clearly challenges the following quote from 20 th century that seems to still encompass prevailing attitudes (quote-website): \"Engineering is the art of organizing and directing men and controlling the forces and materials of nature for the benefit of the human race\".",

The cost and distances for transportation appear in Table 1 from the three informal settlements to the bio-digesters sites.

These values arise by setting the number of families in each settlement: 873, 1100 and 1138 respectively. It is required three times per week that all cassettes be ready at a pickup point in each settlement to be loaded into the truck. Therefore, there must be a worker with a small van, for fetching all the cassettes from all the households to the pickup point. Table 3 shows these costs on a monthly basis. These values are independent on the month, because all the cassettes must be swapped and the worker needs to visit all the households anyway.

Fig. 3 shows that for most of the months the cassettes from informal settlement 1 must be sent to the university, except for January, July and December where the cassettes should be sent to the hospital. As for informal settlement 2, there is a distribution of cassettes between the two bio-digesters that is difficult to predict beforehand. For most of the year, Informal settlement 3 must send its cassettes to the hospital, but during January and July the cassettes must be sent to the university. From Fig. 5 and 6 show the distribution for transporting the cassettes for case study 2. As in case study 1, Fig. 5 and 6 show that the optimal answer to the problem is not trivial and impossible to be solved manually. The optimized cost of the project for case study 2 is \u20ac809883/year for transport considerations only (similar to the amount obtained in case study 1). We need now to add the cost of installation and operation of the three bio-digesters selected. The latest amount is \u20ac91522/year. Therefore, the total amount is \u20ac901405/year.",

Most likely students will point out to Goals number 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 15 (see Fig. 1 ). Table 8 shows in brief possible answers. A reasonable question that must be derived from the Goals analysis is the following: is this project entirely sustainable? An analysis by means of the C2C theory clearly indicates that even though the central part of the project is environmentally sustainable (produce sustainable energy and ecological fertilizer from human waste) there are other parts that might not be. A list of discussion outcomes from the C2C theory appears in Table 9 . The discussion in class about the project could be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 extended further through the following considerations: Can poverty reduction be decoupled from economic growth that entails consumption of natural resources? If a different economic system is not going to be implemented, how can we guarantee that by raising the standard of living of poor communities it is still possible to avoid potential catastrophic impacts on the global ecosystem? If the ecosphere is going to be damaged as a result of economic growth, how can intergenerational and interspecies justice be addressed in a democratic system? Perhaps a bit of economic deliberation is also appropriate at this stage. According to (Rees, 2020) the neoliberal thinking assumes that the economy and the ecosphere are two independent systems, but this author believes that they are not and that by promoting economic growth, the biophysical systems upon which our existence depends, shrinks. The biophysical laws of the biosphere clash with the economic theory that we, humans, have invented. Since the laws of Nature are not going to change, (they are intrinsic to the Planet), it seems reasonable that it is us who need to adjust to Nature's cycles by adopting a new economic thinking. Some people might say that it is not possible to stop the inertia of what we have been doing for the last 200 years, but as we write this section, the COVID-19 pandemic is hitting the so-called developed countries hard, and consequently, economic activity has been voluntarily stopped by confining most citizens to their homes. The global paralysis of the economy that we are seeing is unprecedented and most governments are studying how to maneuver in the new situation. In the end, it becomes obvious that it is possible to stop the economy and change things.",
