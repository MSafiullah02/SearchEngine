Since the first electron microscopic (EM) examinations of human enteric particles resembling coronaviruses in India [Mathan et al, 19751 and in England [Caul et al, 19751, coronaviruslike particles (CVLP) [Macnaughton and Davies, 19811 have been suspected to cause several sorts of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in humans [Chany et al, 1982; Vaucher et al, 19821. However, conflicting data have been reported concerning their role in this disease [Caul and Egglestone, 19821, and their viral nature has also been questioned [Dourmashkin et al, 19801 . Furthermore, from epidemiological surveys performed in different geographical areas by EM observation of fecal extracts, it seems that human enteric CVLP were observed more frequently in tropical areas than in Europe or North America [Macnaughton and Davies, 19811 . The reasons for these differences are not known. Because there is no serological test for them, CVLP can only be identified by EM according to morphological characteristics previously established from virus isolates [Caul et al, 1977; Macnaughton and Davies, 19811. In this article, we report a very high prevalence of CVLP in stools of nonhospitalized control and diarrheic children of an equatorial African country, Gabon. From the differences observed in the prevalence of CVLP in both control and diarrheic children according to the seasonal and age group studied, we here postulate the existence of at least two biologically different varieties of CVLP in human feces and consider the possible influence of relative humidity (RH) as well as temperature and rainfall in their prevalence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 187, "text": "[Garwes, 19821.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 304, "end": 328, "text": "[Mathan et al, 19751 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 340, "end": 392, "text": "[Caul et al, 19751, coronaviruslike particles (CVLP)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 393, "end": 423, "text": "[Macnaughton and Davies, 19811", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 509, "end": 528, "text": "[Chany et al, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 529, "end": 576, "text": "Vaucher et al, 19821.

In the area of our study, there is a short dry season from December to January, a long rainy season from February to May, a long dry season from June to September, and a short rainy season from October to November. Previous studies in areas with similar climates generally recorded the monthly rainfall and the monthly average of the daily maximum and minimum levels of temperature and relative humidity (RH) [Hieber et al, 1978; Viera de Torres et al, 1978; Soenarto et al, 1981; Paniker et al, 19821 .

In the area of our study, we found that fluctuations of monthly rainfall and monthly average of daily maximum temperature followed the classical seasonal division (Fig. 4A,B) . As expected, the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum RH did not show any obvious seasonal fluctuations (not shown).

CVLP were found in diverse groups of individuals with different dietary habits. These included individuals from the indigenous ethnic groups as well as other Africans, Europeans, and North Americans living in Gabon (data not shown). This observation and the fact that we found CVLP frequently in domestic animals (goats and dogs) and in primates maintained in captivity at the CIRMF (data not shown) suggested that the higher prevalence of CVLP in tropical countries [Macnaughton and Davies, 19811 is not due to the different alimentary habits or to metabolic differences [Mathan et al, 19751 but rather to the higher prevalence of a transmissible agent. Interestingly, we found that CVLP were more frequently present in control children than in diarrheic children, as did Schnagl et a1 in studies on Australian aboriginals [ 19781. Moreover, CVLP in the controls were more abundant in stools of children over 2 years old than in children under 2 years old, whereas no significant age difference was found in the diarrheic group. However, in children over 2 years of age (group 11), a significantly higher prevalence of CVLP in controls than in diarrheic patients was observed ( Table I) . The fact that this was not observed in the group I subjects indicated that the reduced CVLP prevalence in diarrheics might be primarily a characteristic of the age group and secondarily an effect of the diarrhea. The reason(s) for this age-dependent difference remains to be elucidated, but it could be explained by the existence of different CVLP in the two age groups.

It is possible that the cyclical variation in prevalence of CVLP depends on a complex interaction between these three climatological parameters. Alternatively, there may exist other unknown cyclical environmental factors which play a role in this apparent seasonal variation. Comparative studies of the prevalence of CVLP in tropical and temperate settings in relation to all the climatological factors might help in understanding the strikingly different prevalences of CVLP observed in these geographical areas.
