Irrespective of the initial cause of myelin degradation, many of these disorders are associated with some degree of CNS inflammation, as indicated by the local activation of microglia, recruitment of macrophages or the intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin. Many of these phenomena are now being duplicated in animal models, providing not only new insights into the pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases, but also unexpected interrelationships between the immune response in the CNS and the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimers disease and HIV encephalopathy. Autoimmune mediated models of inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease have proved particularly valuable in this respect as they allow the effects of defined immune effector mechanisms t o be studied in the absence of CNS infection.",

            "text": "Demyelination in MS is believed to be mediated by an autoimmune response against CNS myelin. This concept is derived from studies of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) , an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS induced in susceptible species following immunisation with CNS tissue or CNS myelin in Freunds complete adjuvant (74). Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that the initiation of clinical disease in EAE is dependent on the expansion and activation of a myelin-specific Th-1 subset CD4+ T cell response. Once activated, this T cell population is able to cross the blood brain barrier and initiate an antigen-dependent, MHC class I1 restricted inflammatory response in the CNS (74). This results in a pronounced increase in the permeability of the blood brain barrier to serum proteins, edema and the recruitment of macrophages into the CNS. It is this macrophage population that is responsible for the neurological deficit associated with the inflammatory response (14) . However, although CNS inflammation results in acute neurological dysfunction in EAE, it does not necessarily induce extensive primary demyelination. This is seen in both the Lewis rat and marmoset, species in which the adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T cell lines or clones specific for the myelin basic protein (MBP) induce CNS inflammation, but virtually no demyelination (24, 27) . In these species, the formation of confluent demyelinating lesions similar to those seen in MS is dependent on a myelin-specific autoantibody response to specifically direct immune effector mechanisms to attack the myelin sheath (43, 44) . However this autoantibody response must be accompanied by an encephalitogenic T cell response in order that its pathogenic potential can be expressed (26) .",

These can result in not only demyelination but also axonal degeneration as is seen in the CNS of the SJL1J mouse following the adoptive transfer of myelin-specific T cells (69) . Tissue damage in this species is apparently antibody-independent and was originally described as \"by-stander\" demyelination. This was for many years loosely attributed to the action of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic products of macrophages and T cells invading the CNS. Only now are the molecular details becoming clear through a combination of in vitro studies using cultured oligodendrocytes and transgenic rodents that develop chronic CNS inflammation as a result of the over-expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS (7, 31, 51) .",

The most striking clinical example is seen in patients with a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy associated with plasma cell dycrasia, many of who (60-70%) develop monoclonal IgM autoantibodies against a sulphated glucuronic acid epitope shared by Po protein, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and several acidic glycolipids in PNS myelin.

Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies demonstrate that MOG is a specific product of the oligodendrocyte which is preferentially located at the outer surface of the myelin sheath and oligodendrocyte plasma membrane (7). The first indication that MOG was an immunodominant target for a demyelinating autoantibody was obtained in guinea pigs with EAE induced by immunisation with autologous spinal cord tissue (25, 28). Subsequently, MOG-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies were shown to mediate demyelination in vivo in rats with EAE (24, 27) .",

In MOG-induced EAE, this concept breaks down as antibody and the associated Th-2 T cell subset are additional factors that must be considered when designing immunotherapies. In particular, strategies based on immune deviationmodifying the immune response to favor a non-inflammatory Th-2 T cell response, rather than a pro-inflammatory Th-1 T cell subset response may be ineffectual, as this will enhance the circulating antibody response without completely eliminating the inflammatory Th-1 component.",

In vitro studies suggest that this may be due to a selective susceptibility of the oligodendrocytes to damage mediated by pro-inflammatory factors, including cytokines, complement and free radicals. The most extensively studied of these potential effector mechanisms is mediated by TNFalpha (TNF). In tissue culture, exogenous TNF, as well as lymphotoxin is not only selectively cytutuxic for primary oligodendrocytes, but also causes myelin damage in myelinating CNS explants (63) . Although several groups have attempted to analyse this effect in vivo by the injection of exogenous TNF, a more elegant approach is to generate transgenic animals that overexpress TNF in defined sets of cells in the CNS. One such animal model was recently developed by Probert and coworkers (50) , who produced a strain of transgenic mice specifically overexpressing TNF in a subpopulation of CNS neurons. TNF is a powerful proinflammatory cytokine (71) that is not only produced by monocytes, but also by neurons in the normal brain (6). TNF overexpressing transgenic mice spontaneously develop a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, which starts at 3-8 weeks of age. Affected animals develop progressively more severe neurological symptoms ranging from mild tremors to paralysis and premature death within -8 months. Interestingly, as a consequence of expression of the transgene, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited into the meninges and CNS parenchyma of the transgenic mice, an event also seen in MS and EAE, where migration of T lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier plays a central role in disease pathogenesis.",

In addition, the transgenic mice develop a pronounced reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis, a characteristic response of the adult CNS to inflammation which once again is also seen in MS (52) and EAE (67). Although the expression of TNF in the CNS clearly results in chronic inflammation and demyelination, it is still not possible to attribute the demyelinating response simply to a direct cytopathic effect of TNF production in the CNS on oligodendrocytes, similar to that described in vitro (55, 62, 63) . Alternative mechanisms may involve TNF acting in synergy with other proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-I) to trigger the local production of other cytopathic mediators, such as nitric oxide, which also has toxic effects on oligodendrocytes (33, 40, 5 5 ) . However, demyelination in this model may not be a direct consequence of the local over-production of TNF, but rather a consequence of the chronic inflammatory response induced in the CNS. It should be noted that both in this TNF model, as well as in transgenic mice engineered to overproduce IL-3 in astrocytes in the CNS (8) , chronic CNS inflammation is associated with microglial activation and proliferation. The molecular mechanisms by which this inflammatory response mediates demyelination are as yet unknown, however the similarities between the two models suggest that chronic activation of the microglial population may play a key role in initiating demyelination. Irrespective of the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for demyelination in these animal models, it is important to note the dysregulation of TNF or IL-3 production in the CNS results in a pathology (CNS inflammation, reactive astrocytosis, microgliosis and myelin disruption) similar to that seen in MS lesions. Dysregulation of intrathecal cytokine production must therefore be consid-ered as yet another potential mechanism in the immunopathogenesis of demyelination in human CNS disease.",

The immunopathogenesis of TMEV is critically dependent on a TMEV-specific CD4+ T cell response that mediates an inflammatory response in the CNS that is similar in many respects to that seen in adoptively transferred EAE in the mouse. In addition, virus antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and demyelinating autoantibodies may also play a role in the immune pathogenesis of demyelination (75). Rodriguez and coworkers ( 5 7) analyzed the role of persistent CNS inflammation in the prevention of spontaneous remyelination in chronically infected SJL/J mice by treatment with either cyclophosphamide, or monoclonal antibodies specific for either CD4 or CD8. Both treatments resulted in significantly better remyelination than was seen in control animals (56), revealing a crucial role 'for T cells in the immunopathogenesis of demyelination/impaired remyelination in TMEVinfected mice. However, it should be noted that spontaneous remyelination in TMEV infected mice is limited and occurs rather late in the disease process, possibly reflecting a marked decrease in the expression of viral antigens in the CNS with time (10, 35) . Unfortunately, as yet neither the effector mecha-nisms nor the target antigens recognized by the T lymphocytes responsible for demyelination have been fully defined in TMEV. This is in contrast to coronavirus MHV-JHM CNS infections in the rat in which at least one mechanism of immune mediated demyelination is relatively well understood. MHV-JHM mediates the formation of sub-acute demyelinating lesions in a significant number of infected rats. Histopathology and immuno-electron microscopy in this model suggest that an anti-viral spike protein antibody response may play a major role in demyelination (75). Spike protein is displayed on the surface of infected oligodendrocytes in the lesions, which are associated with complement activation/deposition, together with high numbers of B cells and plasma cells. These observations suggest that demyelination is mediated by the humoral response to this viral protein, anti-S protein antibodies targeting the oligodendrocyte in the same way as has been described in MOG-mediated EAE (78).",

In one possible scenario, oligodendrocytes and possibly more importantly their precursors may just simply be depleted in the lesions. Indeed, in chronic MS lesions surviving oligodendrocytes are located predominantly at the periphery of the lesions and are rare in the center (53) . Such findings may also be explained by a lack of those factors within lesions that are necessary to sustain and promote oligodendrocyte growth, differentiation and migration. Candidates for such factors are fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, or platelet-derived growth factor, all of which are ubiquitous factors influencing oligodendrocyte growth in vitro (41).

Although the genetic basis of the majority of these disorders involves defects in genes involved in lipid metabolism, several exhibit a selectively detrimental effect o n CNS function which in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is characterized by progressive demyelination of the cerebral white matter. ALD provides an interesting link between a metabolic defect affecting CNS white matter and inflammatory CNS disease, as demyelinating lesions in ALD are associated with a n intense inflammatory response. Infiltrating macrophages and reactive astrocytes are particularly conspicuous at the active edge of the lesions, the frequency of the latter appearing to correlate directly with the intensity of inflammatory demyelination. In contrast, T lymphocytes and plasma cells are concentrated in perivascular cuffs, but not in the parenchyma. In fact, the perivascular cuffs in ALD display a very similar cellular composition as those found in active MS or EAE lesions, containing CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, and, to a lesser degree, B cells and plasma cells (12, 46, 47) . These similarities frequently resulted in ALD and MS being considered similar entities (60), and the suggestion that demyelination in ALD was also immune mediated. However, there appears to be no specific primary immunopathogenic mechanism operating in ALD. Unlike MS lesions where T cells are found at the active demyelinating edge of the lesion, in ALD inflammation appears to be secondary to myelin destruction (60). Moreover, although increased levels of IgA and IgG were found in ALD tissues (4, 70) and high levels of myelin-specific antibodies were detected in sera of ALD patients (61), it is not characteristic for ALD cerebrospinal fluid to contain elevated IgG levels as typically seen in MS.",

These can take the form of missense mutations (49) , in-frame deletions (20), as well as insertions leading to frameshift mutations (22) and, in principal virtually any exons of the PLP gene can be affected (Exon 2 (13, 49) , exon 3 and 4 (20), exon 5 (48), exon 6 (50), or exon 7 (22)).

Two of the most extensively characterized natural mutants are the jimpy (jp/Y) mouse and myelin deficient (md/Y) rat. The jp/Y mutation involves the deletion of the fifth exon, spanning 74 bp of the PLP gene (38), due to an A to G conversion at a conserved AG residue of the 3'-spIice site (30, 37) . The ensuing shift of the reading frame leads to a PLP protein with an altered C-terminal sequence, that is toxic to oligodendrocytes even in the presence of transgenic, wildtype PLP (61).

In contrast, antiserum to PLP failed to reveal any immunoreactive structures in the white matter. Using anti-transferrin antibodies as a marker, some oligodendrocytes of normal morphology could be detected in md/Y rats, but were completely absent in jp/Y mice. Koeppens findings suggest that cells differentiate along the oligodendrocyte lineage in these mutants up to a particular point in their developmental program, but fail to survive as mature cells. This is thought to be due to either a lack of PLP, or alternatively the cytopathic effects of hydrophobic peptides derived from the proteolysis of the aberrant protein product.

This has been observed in several lines of PLP/DM20 transgenic mice and rats that were produced over the last few years. In DM-20 overexpressing transgenic mice (65) that carry 70 copies of a transgene cassette encompassing a human PLP gene promoter element and human DM-20 cDNA, life span is shortened and demyelination is seen in the CNS. Abnormalities in these DM-20 transgenic animals became apparent at -3 months and included an unsteady gait that progressively worsened with time, and an increasing frequency of seizures. Death occurred at 8-10 months of age. These clinical symptoms correlated with CNS demyelination. A t 3 months of age, when DM-20 overexpressing transgenic mice were phenotypically still asymptomatic, no pathological changes could be observed in the CNS. However, 7 months later a dra-matic decrease in the overall amount of CNS myelin was evident, many axons in the optic nerve were thinly myelinated or even completely denuded of myelin. Moreover, many of the surviving myelin sheaths were abnormal or exhibiting signs of disruption and axonal degeneration. These changes were associated with a prominent astrogliosis and the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates (3 1). The mechanism of demyelination in DM-20 overexpressing mice is not known, but could be due to the downregulation of PLP synthesis by the DM-20 transgene. Alternatively, elevated levels of DM-20 may result in a block in myelin synthesis/maintenance following completion of the initial phase of neonatal myelinogenesis. Intriguingly, a premature arrest of myelin formation was also reported for transgenic mice with an increased proteolipid protein gene dosage (1 7, 54) .",

During this time the trangenic animals were clinically normal and indistinguishable in behavior from wild-type littermates. However, after 2-3 months of age, a progressive degeneration of the myelin sheaths could be observed in the CNS. This abnormality was clinically asymptomatic until an age of about six months at which time heterozygous transgenic mice displayed tremors and ataxia, followed by severe convulsions. These symptoms coincided with a rapid degeneration of myelin sheaths, associated with a very marked survival of oligodendrocytes and axonal sparing. These highly selective demyelinating lesions were extensively infiltrated by \"microglia-like cells\" (microglia or macrophages). This selective and abrupt destruction of myelin was ascribed to a systemic immune response, possibly involving the production of autoantibodies, rather than to a direct affect of the transgene on the oligodendrocyte. In this scenario, the initial slow degeneration of myelin eventually triggered a myelin-specific autoimmune response, culminating in demyelination in the absence of chronic inflammation. It should however be noted that this pathology was not observed in other lines of heterozygous PLP overexpressing transgenic mice produced by Readhead and coworkers (54) . These workers reported that although isolated uncompacted myelin structures and a slight overall reduction of myelin thickness occurred in aged heterozygous animals, there was no evidence for the extensive degeneration of myelin sheaths or destruction of oligodendrocytes. In contrast, homozygous animals exhibit a dysmyelinating pheneotype in which oligodendrocytes were only rarely engaged in myelination (17, 54) , and microglia-like cells with inclusions (17), or astrogliosis (54) were prominent features.",

In some cases, immune responses to antigens expressed by oligodendrocytes are primary events. In this situation activated antigen-specific T cells cross the endothelial blood brain barrier, initiate a local inflammatory response and pave the way for other blood borne cells and molecules such as antibodies to enter the CNS. Destruction of myelin sheaths can then be mediated by either antibody, or the local action of inflammatory cytokines.",

In this and related disorders, damage to myelin sheaths occurs first as a consequence of genetic defects that preferentially affect cells in the CNS. Only in later stages of disease do inflammatory cells become evident and mediate myelin disruption. The availability of novel animal models that mimic these pathologies provide us for the first time with the basic tools to elucidate the many different mechanisms that can result in the selective destruction of CNS myelin in human disease.",
