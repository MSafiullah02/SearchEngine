Individual plate wells are coated with the wild-type cis-acting DNA elements for several inflammation-related transcription factors. After addition of nuclear extract, cellular transcription factors bind to their consensus sequences and interactions are measured by colorimetric changes. As the standard microplate reader could only register one blank well per TransFactor plate, relative negative controls were used to determine the activity of each experimental sample, with a sample reading of 2-fold higher than the controls being deemed significant. The transcription factors c-Fos, FosB, CREB-1, and ATF2 were all activated by the addition of SARS-CoV N protein to the sample well, with CREB-1 having the most dramatic increase in activity, about five times higher than the vector control (Fig. 3\n). c-Fos, FosB, and ATF-2 all showed increased colorimetric activities as indicated in Fig. 3. These factors are components of AP-1 signal transduction pathway, and their activation suggested that SARS-CoV N protein is involved in AP-1 activation. In contrast, NF-\u03baB sample did not show increased signals, suggesting that the increase of signals of AP-1-related factors is specific.",

The PathDetect pAP-1Luc reporter vector uses the inducible cis-enhancer element (TGACTAA)7 to bind potential regulators of AP-1 activity. Two cell lines were used in this assay, Vero cells, and Hu7 cells. We used pcDNA-N as N protein expression vector pcDNA3.1(\u2212), and a construct expressing SARS-CoV membrane protein in pcDNA3.1 (pcDNA-M) to investigate whether NC specifically induces AP-1 signal transduction pathway. We also transfected serial dilutions of the aforementioned constructs to determine if AP-1 activation is dose-dependent. The luminometer reading for the mock transfection was considered blank for this experiment. As shown in Fig. 4A\n, the results from Vero cells indicated that transfection of pcDNA-N resulted in about four times higher chemiluminescence reading than that in cells transfected with either the pcDNA3.1(\u2212) or pcDNA-M. With a decrease in amount of pcDNA-N, Ap-1 activities decreased accordingly in the pCDNA-N transfected cells, clearly suggesting that induction of AP-1 by SARS-CoV N protein is dose-dependent. Noticeably, transfection of cells with neither the pcDNA-M nor pcDNA3.1 vector was found to affect AP-1 activities. To further determine whether this activation is cell-type specific, the Huh7 cells were used under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 4B, AP activation by SARS-CoV N protein is four times higher than that observed in cells transfected with either pcDNA3.1(\u2212) or pcDNA-M. Clearly, results obtained from the two cell lines are consistent in terms of AP-1 activation.",

To our knowledge, this is the first time that a coronavirus N protein has been identified as AP-1 signal transduction activator. In addition, we have also found that the induction of AP-1 by SARS-CoV N protein is not cell type-specific because in both Vero and Huh7 cells AP-1 activities were increased by SARS-CoV N protein expression. Finally, the fact that expression of SARS-CoV M protein did not result in an increase in the level of AP-1 activities not only rules out the possibilities of experimental artifacts but also strengthens the claim of selective activation of AP-1 by SARS-CoV N protein.",

C-Fos and FosB are cellular homologues of a viral oncogene carried by murine sarcoma virus, and together with Jun or ATF transcription factors, assemble to form the heterodimer AP-1 complex. The Jun transcription factors can form homodimers with other Jun subunits or heterodimers with any of the AP-1-related factors, and are therefore also central to the AP-1 signal transduction pathway [14].",

Interaction of the nucleocapsid proteins from other members of the coronavirus with the AP-1 pathway has not been documented in the literature. Whether SARS-CoV NC directly interacts with components of AP pathway or other intermediate proteins requires vigorous investigation. Furthermore, dissection of the functional domains of SARS-CoV N protein and/or identification of amino acid residue(s) involved in AP-1 activation will provide insightful information regarding pathogenesis of SARS. These studies are currently under way in our laboratories. In conclusion, our study for the first time shows that SARS-CoV can activate important signal transduction pathway with appreciable selectivity since AP-1, not NF-\u03baB, is activated by SARS-CoV N protein, while the SAS-CoV M was found not to activate either AP-1 or NF-\u03baB.",
