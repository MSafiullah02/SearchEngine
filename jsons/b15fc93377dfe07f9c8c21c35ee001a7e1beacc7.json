In the present study, two different rodent models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were used to demonstrate the ability of murine gammaherpesvirus-68 ( + HV-68) to exacerbate development of neurological symptoms. SJL mice received UVinactivated + HV-68 or intranasal + HV-68, followed by immunization against proteolipidprotein peptide 139-151. Infected mice became moribund within 10 days postimmunization, whereas mice exposed to UV-inactivated + HV-68 recovered. In the second model, Lewis rats were exposed to UV-inactivated + HV-68 or to + HV-68, followed by passive transfer of encephalitogenic T lymphocytes specific for myelin basic protein. Consistently, infected rats had higher clinical scores, and this result was observed during acute or latent + HV-68 infection. It is unlikely that this + HV-68-induced exacerbation was due to significant viral replication within the central nervous system since nested PCR, viral plaque assays, and infectious-centers assays demonstrated no detectable virus in spinal cords or brains of infected rodents undergoing EAE. Taken together, these studies demonstrate increased clinical symptoms of EAE in rodents infected by a gammaherpesvirus that has a limited ability to invade the central nervous system.",

            "text": "At the forefront of the list of possible environmental factors that might exacerbate the development or severity of MS are viral infections. In fact, Theiler's-virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) has been widely used as a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that consistently reproduces the symptomology of human disease [8] . A coronavirusmurine hepatitis virus -has also been shown to cause a demyelinating disease of the CNS [9] . Recent studies have suggested an association between infection with the human gammaherpesvirus, EBV, and the risk of MS. In one prospective epidemiological study, anti-EBV antibody levels were elevated in women with MS, suggesting that EBV might be involved in the etiology of this autoimmune disease [10] . This recent work supports previous studies that demonstrated increased anti-EBV antibody titers in patients with MS [11] . In addition, a particular T cell receptor from an MS patient recognized both a myelin-basic-protein peptide and a peptide derived from an EBV protein [12] . These studies suggest a mechanism of molecular mimicry that might facilitate development of MS at some time after EBV infection. Fig. 1 . SJL mice infected with + HV-68 show increased clinical scores and weight loss during immunization-induced EAE. (A) Groups of SJL mice were exposed to UVinactivated + HV-68 (closed squares, n=8) or infected with + HV-68 (closed circles, n=10), 2 days prior to immunizing with PLP peptide 139-151. Control mice (closed triangles, n=4) were + HV-68 infected, but immunized with an irrelevant peptide. An arrow indicates the day of immunization (i.e. day 0). Following immunization, mice were scored daily for the presence of clinical symptoms. Results are presented as mean clinical scores (\u00b1 standard deviations) at the indicated times post-immunization. (B) Mice were weighed daily and the percent decrease in body weight determined. Results are presented as mean body weights (\u00b1 standard deviations). Asterisks indicate significant differences (p X 0.01) when comparing + HV-68-infected mice versus mice treated with UV-inactivated + HV-68. These studies are representative of three separate experiments.",

            "text": "A direct relationship between viral infection and the development of MS has been difficult to prove because of the reliance on human autopsy material or material taken from blood and spinal fluid. To circumvent such limitations, rodent models of MS have been developed and have contributed greatly to our understanding of the cellular and molecular events that occur during demyelinating diseases of the CNS. Relapsing EAE is a Thelper-cell-and macrophage-mediated disease, characterized by inflammation and then demyelination within the CNS. The SJL mouse is often used as a model for such a disease, and active immunization with the immunodominant peptide of proteolipid protein (PLP 139-151) induces relapsing EAE in these mice [13] . EAE can also be induced by passive transfer of CD4 + encephalitogenic T lymphocytes into certain strains of mice [14] and rats [15] . Such passive transfer of antigen-specific T helper cells obviates the need to actively immunize mice, and allows studies of post-immunization events in developing EAE. Passive transfer of encephalitogenic T lymphocytes into Lewis rats provides a reproducible nonrelapsing form of EAE that has been used to investigate the acute form of the disease [16] .",

To address whether + HV-68 was present in the CNS, a sensitive, nested PCR procedure was performed to detect the presence of the DNA encoding + HV-68 gp150 in the spleens and spinal cords of infected mice, and infected mice undergoing clinical EAE. Fig. 2 shows the results of one such PCR where viral genomes were easily detectable in peripheral lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen), but not in the spinal cord of infected mice. This was true even when nested PCR was performed for 20 + 25 cycles, whereas such viral DNA sequences were abundant in the spleen using only 20 + 20 PCR cycles. Although qualitative, these differences in viral genome presence in the CNS versus peripheral lymphoid organs suggested that minimal viral replication or latency occurs in the CNS.",

Within the latter group, some rats were non-treated (EAE -) or some rats were administered encephalitogenic T cells to induce EAE (EAE +) as indicated. Rats that were exposed to UVinactivated + HV-68 or infected with + HV-68, without EAE induction (n=3), were killed at day 15 post-infection, which represents the peak of leukocytosis. Rats infected and administered encephalitogenic T cells to induce EAE (n=3) were killed at day 12 post-infection, when rats had clinical scores between 1 and 2. After the rats were killed, tissue from the spleen and spinal cord was taken and DNA extracted for PCR to amplify the genes encoding + HV-68 gp150 or G3PDH. The number of PCR cycles used for each amplification is indicated. Results are presented as amplified PCR products electrophoresed on ethidium-bromidestained agarose gels. These studies were performed twice with similar results.",

However, upon resolution of the mononucleosis-like acutephase of the disease, splenomegaly resolves and + HV-68 remains latent in leukocytes. We questioned whether rats with latent + HV-68 infection also had increased clinical scores following passive administration of encephalitogenic T cells. For these studies, groups of rats were exposed to UV-inactivated + HV-68 or infected with + HV-68, and allowed to recover from acute infection and splenomegaly. By this time post-infection, rats had viral genomes present and latent virus in splenic leukocytes, but no detectable plaque-forming virus in tissue homogenates. On day 41 post-infection, 3\u00d710 6 encephalitogenic T lymphocytes were given intravenously, and rats were scored daily for the development of clinical symptoms. Consistently, rats with latent + HV-68 infection had increased clinical scores when compared with animals exposed to UV-inactivated + HV-68 (Fig. 8 ). To address this possibility, a sensitive, nested PCR procedure was performed to detect the presence of the DNA encoding + HV-68 gp150 in the spleens and spinal cords of infected rats and infected rats undergoing clinical EAE. Fig. 9 shows the results of one such PCR where viral genomes were easily detectable in peripheral lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen), but not in the spinal cord of infected rats. When nested PCR was performed for 20 + 25 cycles, no + HV-68 gp150 DNA could be detected in spinal cord, whereas such viral DNA sequences were abundant in the spleen using only 20 + 15 PCR cycles. Similar results were found when nested PCR was performed using frontal cortex and cerebellum (data not shown).",

Groups of SJL mice were exposed to UV-inactivated + HV-68 ( + HV-68 -) or infected with + HV-68 ( + HV-68 +), and non-immunized (EAE -) or immunized to induce EAE (EAE +) as indicated. Mice that were exposed to UV-inactivated + HV-68 or infected with + HV-68, but nonimmunized (n=3), were killed at day 15 post-infection, which represents the peak of leukocytosis. Mice infected and immunized to induce EAE (n=3) were killed at day 10 post-infection, when mice had clinical scores between 2 and 3. After mice were killed, tissue from the spleen and spinal cord was taken and DNA extracted for PCR to amplify the genes encoding + HV-68 gp150 or G3PDH. The number of PCR cycles used for each amplification is indicated. Results are presented as amplified PCR products electrophoresed on ethidiumbromide-stained agarose gels. These studies were performed twice with similar results.",
