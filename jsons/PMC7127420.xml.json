            "text": "We previously reported on several 2-adamantyl-substituted thiazolidin-4-ones showing modest anti-HIV-1 activity [1]. In the case of racemic (\u00b1)-2-adamantan-1-yl-3-(4,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)-thiazolidin-4-one, a remarkable antiviral potency (EC50\n = 0.35 \u03bcM) was observed. The presence of the adamantane moiety played an important role in the eventual antiviral activity of the compound. This compound behaved as a typical non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) with non-competitive inhibition of RT with respect to the nucleotide substrate (K\ni\n = 12 \u03bcM; K\ni/K\nm\n = 5.5). Separation of the enantiomers via diastereoisomeric salts was performed for this thiazolidinone. X-ray studies enabled us to ascribe the R configuration to (+)-2-adamantan-1-yl-3-(4,6-dimethyl-pyridin-2-yl)-thiazolidin-4-one. Furthermore, it was found that the (+)-isomer shown in\nFig. 1, was predominantly responsible for the potent anti-HIV-1 activity (EC50 value of 0.178 \u03bcM), while the levo isomer was more than 60-fold less active. These findings confirm the general rule, that only one defined NNRTI enantiomer inhibits RT while the other one is usually markedly less potent or even inactive [2], [3].",

The thiazolidinones 22\u201329 have fluorine or chlorine substituted phenyl ring at the 2-position instead of the adamantane moiety and consist of the adamantyl group connected via methylene or ethylene bridges at the nitrogen atom of the thiazolidinone ring. It should be mentioned that such haloaromatic substituents were present in the most active thiazolidinones described by Monforte et al. [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Many of these thiazolidinones had the pyridyl or pyrimidyl groups as N-substituents [7], [8]. Results obtained by these authors showed that compounds with a pyrimidine nucleus were mostly 2\u20133 times less active against HIV-1. The most active thiazolidinones contained MeO or dihalo substituents attached to the aromatic ring and a methyl group at the pyridyl nucleus.",

The structural difference between compounds 8\u201311 and compound 7 consists only in the replacement of a pyridin-2-yl by a pyrimidin-2-yl or pyrimidin-4-yl nucleus in 11, as the N-substituent. The thiazolidinone 8 (EC50\n = 0.67 \u03bcM), bearing a 4,6-dimethylpyrimidinyl group, is only \u223ctwo times less potent than the parent reference compound 7. Its antiviral potency and selectivity was close to that of the clinically-used compound nevirapine. The replacement of the 4,6-dimethylpyrimidinyl by the 4-methylpyrimidynyl in 10 (EC50\n = 4.50 \u03bcM) results in a 6-fold reduction in antiviral potency. A similar tendency was observed in our previous work on thiazolidinones containing 4,6-dimethylpyridinyl- and 4-methylpyridinyl-rings. Thus, 4,6-dimethyl-substituents connected to a heterocycle seem to be crucial for the activity. It was also striking to notice that minor modifications such as the inclusion of a methyl and/or chloro group at the pyrimidine ring may have a dramatic effect on the eventual antiviral activity of compounds (Table 2).",

In contrast to 8\u201311, these compounds contain an adamantylmethylene instead of an adamantyl substituent connected to the heterocyclic ring at the 2-position. This little modification of structure invariably causes reduction of antiviral activity (EC50\n = 8.6\u201353 \u03bcM). For example, when a methylene bridge was inserted between the 1-adamantyl and the heterocyclic ring in 8 giving compound 12 (EC50\n = 8.60 \u03bcM), a 13-fold reduction of potency was observed. This tendency is also evident when comparing, for instance, 10 (EC50\n = 4.50 \u03bcM) and 17 or 18 (completely inactive), with their respective anti-HIV-1 agents reported previously [1]. These data point to crucial and rather fixed interaction points of adamantane and other parts of the inhibitory molecule with the HIV-1 RT enzyme, a property which is often observed for many other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It is interesting that compounds 8 and 12 having a pyrimidin-2-yl ring at the N-3 position showed activity against HIV-1 whereas 11 and 21 with a pyrimidin-4-yl substituent lost their antiviral properties.",

For example 24, 26 and 29 showed EC50's of 1.0\u20132.0 \u03bcM, while the 50%-effective concentration for 23 and 28 were 7.8 and 11.0 \u03bcM, respectively. In this series the effect of the alkylene bridge length is not unambiguous, since the ethyl results in a more pronounced anti-HIV-1 activity than methyl in compounds 23 and 29 (compare with 22 and 28), whereas the presence of a methyl resulted in more active agents than ethyl in compounds 25 and 27 (compare with 24 and 26). It should also be noticed that these thiazolidinones exhibit a certain antiviral activity against HIV-2 (EC50\n = 6.5\u201346 \u03bcM), but it is currently unclear whether this activity reflects a specific antiviral effect rather than (and most likely) a toxic effect of the compounds.

The molecules 12, 18 and 21 are topologically non-distinguishable, what can be seen from values of both volumes and surfaces of the molecules. Slightly smaller is molecule 7 (see Table 4). In our opinion the dipole moment might be treated as a global measure of electrical properties of molecules. From Fig. 5 one can see that the four molecules have distinct electro-negative regions (shown in red to yellow) and electro-positive ones (shown in blue to green). The molecules in the upper row of Fig. 5 are endowed with higher dipole moments with the higher electrostatic potential localized in the groove region between the carbonyl oxygen and the aromatic nitrogen atoms. The major difference between molecules in the upper and those in the bottom row of Fig. 5 is that the latter have hydrogen atoms of the pyridine/pyrimidine ring in the close vicinity of the carbonyl oxygen of the thiazolidinone whereas 7 and 12 have on these sites nitrogen atoms and hence a more negative potential. One can also see that the thiazolidinone fragment of both molecules is more co-planar with the aromatic ring than it is for the upper-row molecules. These facts might correlate with the anti-HIV activity of compounds listed in Table 4. Compound 26 belongs to a completely different class of molecules but from the topological point of view it is very similar to the others and it has a very similar volume and surface. This molecule has the dipole moment similar to 7 and 12. The crystal structure of 8 hasn't been studied. However, because of the similar activity to the previously studied molecule 7\n[1], it was essential to compare values such as the dipole moment and the electrostatic potential distribution for this molecule. We therefore performed simple quantum-mechanical calculations to evaluate these values. As can be derived from Table 4 and Fig. 4 compounds having higher dipole moments and twisted aromatic rings in relation to the heterocyclic one showed anti-HIV activity whereas the remaining thiazolidinones are completely inactive.",

The first one includes the thiazolidine-4-ones with the adamantyl moiety attached directly, or via methylene or ethylene bridges, to the thiazolidinone ring. Compounds with the adamantyl group at the 3-position of the heterocyclic ring belong to the second subclass of NNRTIs. Compounds 7 and 8 bearing a 4,6-dimethylpyridinyl and 4,6-dimethylpyrimidinyl nucleus showed the highest anti-HIV activities (EC50\n = 0.35 and 0.67 \u03bcM, respectively). The X-ray measurements revealed that these agents exist in a \u201cbutterfly conformation\u201d common for many NNRTIs. Quantum chemical calculations revealed also that the anti-HIV activity of the compounds strongly depends on their dipole moments.",
