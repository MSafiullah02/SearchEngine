This versatile technology has made tangible and innovative breakthroughs due to an increasing demand for customized devices in personalized therapy and diagnostics in addition to bio-inspired medical devices. The technique requires printing one or more materials in a layer-by-layer manner with a 3D printer, and by adjusting the shape of each individual layer, a complex, solid object can be formed from a digital model. The main advantages of 3D printing include high reproducibility and control, fast manufacturing, individualized product series, facile modifications of a product at a designed level with no restrictions on its spatial arrangement and convenient cost-effective manufacture [1]. The most significant applications are found in regenerative medicine (mainly tissue and organ fabrication), ophthalmological implants, 3D printed drugs, customized prosthetic, medical phantoms and cancer research.",

This AM technology is also called 3D bioprinting. As in conventional 3D printing, it produces objects based in a layer-by-layer approach. Generally, two strategies are used: fabrication of acellular functional scaffolds which are further seeded with cells and cell-laden constructs developed to mimic their native analogues [4]. An alternative approach can be in vivo bioprinting, the technique in which cells and materials are deposited directly into or on the patient. This can be a solution for in vivo regeneration of tissues right after an injury or to accelerate healing [5\u20137].",

            "text": "Specialized bioprinters use biological inks (often called bioinks) such as cytocompatible hydrogels. Hydrogels are defined as insoluble hydrophilic polymeric networks which have the ability to swell and absorb a high degree of water without disintegration. Hydrogels are particularly attractive materials for such applications due to (i) their ability to mimic the ECM, (ii) their tunable characteristics that allows an efficient and homogenous seeding of various cells and (iii) they possess a porous structure that allows the transfer of different nutrients, fundamental for cell viability and differentiation [8, 9]. Hydrogels can also provide support for printing of high resolution, customized 3D geometries. Furthermore, self-healing hydrogels with shear-thinning properties allow the ability to print in any direction [10, 11]. Even though 3D bioprinting has shown varying degrees of success, it has a major drawback as stated in Gao et al. paper [11]. The main downside is that 3D printing only takes into account the initial state of the printed structure and supposes is static and inanimate. To overcome this problem, a new concept called 4D printing was introduced in 2013, allowing bioengineered constructs to be pre-programmed to evolve in a particular way after printing [12]. Unlike previous technology, 4D printing uses the ability of shape and functionality transformation over time when exposed to an intrinsic/external stimuli allowing a more accurately imitation of the dynamics of the native tissues, and is based on the integration of smart biomaterials [13\u201316]. Among the possible responsive materials, self-healing polymers, thermally activated polymers, smart/nano-composites, piezoelectric materials, shape memory alloys and shape memory polymers have gained increasing interest [17]. Furthermore, as expected, 4D bioprinting or laser assisted bio-printing has recently emerged. 4D bioprinting is a specialized extension of 3D bioprinting that aims at reconstructing the biochemical and biophysical composition, as well as the hierarchical morphology of various tissues using stimuli-responsive biomaterials and cells [18].",

Five-axis 3D printing is an extension of 3D printing where the print head has the ability to move around from 5 different angles due to a mobile plateau. This allows creating curved layers which are stronger than the traditional 3D printed flat layers [19]. Furthermore, this means that curved-shaped products or implants with improved strength can be produced with promising applications in orthopedics and dentistry [20].",

The curing is activated by the decomposition of a photoinitiator into free radicals when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) or visible light sources. Even though this technique is extensively used to produce polymeric scaffolds, the simultaneous printing of cells is not recommended due to the fact that photoinitiators are usually insoluble in water and need to be dissolved in organic solvents. This can be highly toxic for cells and a major drawback for stereolithography. Another issue is that UV light can damage the cell during curing, so they are usually embedded in the scaffold after printing [27].",

The correct choice of material is a critical step in the printing process and can lead to constructs with improved functionality, good mechanical properties and customized 3D geometries. The materials range from thermoplastics, thermosets, polymer-based composites to polymers blended with various biomolecules [12]. The generation of complex, functional archetypes and life-changing products for biomedical applications has induced the need for printing with biocompatible or \u2018biofunctionalizable\u2019 inks, also called bioinks. Their composition and design is based upon the type of printing employed and targeted application, but typically they are composed of the matrix components (usually cyto- and biocompatible hydrogel precursor formulations or block co-polymers), nutrients, and/or bioactive signals [39]. Some polymeric mixtures include living cells isolated from the patient and raised in the laboratory. During the printing the bio-ink fluid is gelled by physical, chemical or photo-crosslinking procedure in order to preserve its shape and to minimize the structure collapse. A required condition is that the gelation should occur after the material exits the nozzle tip to prevent blockages inside the printing head. The final bioink construct consists of a template that acts as a support for the suspended cells [40].",

[51] have created an alginate hydrogel for nerve tissue engineering applications by using indirect bioprinting. This method involves the application of a sacrificial framework that temporarily supports the formation of the polymer scaffold. Gels with various polymer concentrations were obtained (0.5%, 1.5%, and 3%) wherein the sacrificial framework was based on a 50% gelatine scaffold. The results show that both the mechanical and biological properties of the fabricated scaffolds are affected by the concentration of alginate as well as the proposed sterilization technique (ethanol disinfection or UV irradiation). The scaffolds were characterized biologically using Schwann cells and showed a better cell functionality when fabricated with a lower concentration of alginate compared to a higher one. The strategy of manufacturing and testing the printed material is briefly illustrated in Fig. 3.",

The multi-component hydrogel was obtained by graft polymerization of hydroxylethyl acrylate to hyaluronic acid and then grafting of methacryloyl-gelatin via radical polymerization mechanism. The resulted bioink has excellent biocompatibility, good swelling, appropriate viscosity, shear-thinning, and viscoelasticity, cytocompatibility, has as well the ability to deliver small molecular drugs (such as dimethyl-oxaloyl-glycine) and most importantly the gel showed printability in good shape. In another study, HA was combined with methylcellulose to obtain bioprinted structures with high cell viability for tissue engineering applications [67]. The results showed that the mechanical properties can be easily regulated by altering the ratio between the polymers, and mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), encapsulated in the gel, survived the 3D bioprinting process and remain viable for one week. Furthermore, remarkable efforts have been made to regulate neuronal growth by using 3D polymeric networks based on HA [68].",

Furthermore, owing to its excellent mechanical strength, PCL has been successfully used to create bioresorbable cardiovascular stents in a one-step process by using Fused Filament Fabrication and a 3-axis 3D printing technology. The stents showed a good radial behaviour with an average of 320% of radial expansion and an average of 22.78% of recoil. The final characteristics of the printed device and the dimensional precision of the printing process were strongly influenced by the printing temperature and printing flow rate [85]. In addition, the authors continued the study and analysed the effects of various sterilization processes on the stability of PCL stents which showed that ethanol can be an effective sterilization treatment because it doesn\u2019t affects the material properties. Researchers have also approached acid poly(lactide), PLC and PCL/PLA blends for 3D printed stents to restore the functions of vascular tissue (Fig. 4). The PLA, PLC and PCL / PLA composite stents were additionally seeded with 3T3 cell and evaluated and compared with regards to cell proliferation, degradation rates, mechanical dilatation and radial dynamic tests to determine the best parameters for the medical device. The PCL / PLA blend stent, which showed medium levels of degradation rates and mechanical modulus, and a printing accuracy of 85\u201395%, was proved having the best results [86]. Overall, these studies have shown that 3D printing technology may be suitable for the production of biodegradable cardiovascular stents which degrade in time to restore vessel patency and permit remodelling while maintaining recoil [87\u201389].",

[10] have reported a self-repairing 4D multifunctional material that can be used in the production of components for human-machine interactions and soft robotics. The material is based on photo-crosslinking PCLDMA macro-monomers with methacrylates bearing UPyMA motifs. To analyse the thermally activated shape memory effect and self-healing properties of the proposed chemical structure an opposing thumb with a forefinger was printed via DLP technology. The sample was further partially cut. Next, the material was heated to a temperature higher than the PCL melting temperature (Tm), which allowed the sample to be deformed in a desired temporary form. Once deformed, the structure was cooled down in order to fix the temporary shape by the crystallization of PCL crystalline domains. Re-heating the structure at a temperature T > Tm allows the sample to recover its initial printed shape, thus demonstrating the potential to be used as actuator devices in soft robotics applications. Furthermore, various complex and intricate folding transitions have been obtained by using the conventional properties of shape memory thermoplastics polymers (SMP) such as PLA, ABS, PC, and PU [154, 155].",

PDMS serves as the flexible matrix component while the magnetic particle subjected to the magnetic field could obtain or lose their magnetization due to their low magnetic coercive force and high permittivity, compelling macroscopic change. Furthermore, the printed material changes its shape under the magnetic force but recover its initial configuration due to the ink\u2019s elastic behaviour when the magnetic field is removed. By using direct-ink writing, McCracken et al. developed revolutionary iron oxide nanoparticle\u2013loaded ionotropic hydrogels which are capable to actuate in the presence of local magnetic fields [166]. In order to characterize the proposed material, they printed various structures that mimic elementary dynamic/flexural features of Echinoderm and Cnidarian organisms, with a particular focus on the tentacle morphologies of sea jellies. Studies have shown that the devices have high mechanical toughness and flexibility, their structure remains intact in aqueous environments with shear and turbulent flow, but they can also move in different directions in response to stimuli while submerged. Another example was proposed by Wei et al. [167]. The authors have described an approach to constructing 4D printed stents with magneto-responsive materials developed by direct-write printing of ultraviolet cross-linking PLA-based inks.

These include the impossibility to print large volumes of materials, slow print times, limited material availability, inaccurate actuation, high-cost printers, and there is no possibility to print more materials on the same printer. For bioprinting, it is essential to further develop in-depth and complex in vitro and in vivo studies assessing efficacy, and safety. More importantly, there is only one AM product approved by the FDA on the medical market. The main obstacles can be found in the lack of regulation and control standards for the additive manufactured medical devices. However, regulatory requirements are hard to implement, mainly due to the variability of AM methods. Taking into account all the techniques and materials currently available, there is no possibility to provide a universal set of guidelines for all printing methods. Furthermore, although the studies highlighted in this review are certainly innovative and may form the basis of future medical devices, follow-up studies that use and in-depth characterize the applied concepts are generally not pursued. So far, for example, reports that demonstrate the performance of an implanted device made by using the AM technology remain scarce. Few materials present complex geometries and elastic properties that mimic the human tissue. Moreover, studies that demonstrate the application of these research efforts in a clinical context have hardly been published. These are the main current limitations of AM applicable to the biomedical field that companies and researchers are trying to solve in order to produce devices in predictive and reproductive ways.",

In the coming years, a quantitative increase will also be recorded in the development of high-performance printers, a good example being the 5D technology. Five-axis 3D printing is currently of high interest because it addresses some of the challenges associated with regular 3D printing. Thus, due to its ability to build an object from several directions, stronger parts can be produced. Multi-material printers will also be developed. The investments in this area will further lead to innovations in high-performance biocompatible materials. A strong emphasis on personalization and individualization will also be pursued.",

Furthermore, it seems that AM technology is turning into a multidisciplinary field that will require scientists to become knowledgeable outside of their main field of study, including biology, material science, and chemistry.
