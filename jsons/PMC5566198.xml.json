ICD-10-CM will include significantly more codes (68 000). However, the increase in granularity is not uniform, but, instead, is concentrated in specific chapters (eg, injury and external cause), and a big portion of the new codes are created by formulaic expansion (eg, laterality, episode of care).17\nTable 1 shows examples of the loss of specificity encountered when encoding diseases in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM, compared to SNOMED CT. Many rare congenital skin anomalies are encompassed by a single code in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and cannot be distinguished from each other. Lumping groups of diagnoses together occurs even for more common conditions like acidosis and brachial plexus disorders. The lack of specificity in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM will affect the ability of the EHR to deliver disease-specific clinical decision support, because diseases with very different etiologies and management strategies are lumped together in these terminologies.\n",

One unique feature of SNOMED CT is extensibility by post-coordination \u2013 the creation of new meaning by modifying or refining existing concepts. The only way to extend ICD is to add local extension codes, which (as the name implies) are only interpretable locally and are meaningless to an outside reader. With post-coordination, computability and interoperability are preserved. It is possible to determine equivalence and subsumption between existing concepts and post-coordinated expressions, so that post-coordinated expressions can be shared and integrated. Liu et al.18 found that post-coordination could potentially increase SNOMED CT\u2019s coverage of summary-level clinical concepts from 80 to 96%. According to Campbell et al.,19 only 1.5% of problem list terms could not be represented in SNOMED CT with post-coordination. However, from an implementation perspective, post-coordination is nontrivial. Challenges include data entry interface design, data storage and retrieval, and computational requirements. In the study by Lee et al.,4 6 of the 13 healthcare organizations interviewed were able to use post-coordination in some way.",

In ICD-9-CM, the corresponding code is E878.2 Surgical operation with anastomosis, bypass, or graft, with natural or artificial tissues used as implant causing abnormal patient reaction, or later complication, without mention of misadventure at time of operation. Since such descriptions cannot be used directly in data entry, the ICD implementers often need to create interface terms that clinical users can readily recognize. There is no such need in SNOMED CT, because the terms in SNOMED CT are words and phrases directly used in clinical discourse.",

To facilitate counting and ensure data comparability, only codes at the lowest level (the leaf codes) can be used. To satisfy these requirements, two special types of codes are necessary: the \u201cunspecified\u201d (also known as \u201cnot otherwise specified\u201d or NOS) and \u201cnot elsewhere classified\u201d (or NEC) codes. The unspecified codes are used when specific information is missing. For example, 480.0 Viral pneumonia, unspecified is used when the medical record does not contain the specific virus causing pneumonia. The unspecified code is necessary, since the parent code 480 Viral pneumonia (which essentially conveys the same meaning as Viral pneumonia, unspecified) cannot be used. NEC codes are used when there is additional specific information in the medical record, but no corresponding specific code. Pneumonia caused by Human metapneumovirus is coded as 480.8 Pneumonia due to other virus not elsewhere classified, since there is no specific code for this condition. In data entry, clinical users may be confused by the NOS and NEC codes. In SNOMED CT, there are no NOS and NEC codes. The clinician can use codes at any level of specificity, as warranted by the clinical situation.",

The subtle change in the meaning of NEC codes is even more problematic, because it is difficult to detect (since the code and its description remain the same). This is called semantic drift, in Cimino\u2019s desiderata paper.21 For example, the code 480.8 Pneumonia due to other virus not elsewhere classified included SARS Pneumonia before 2003, but not afterwards, because 480.3 Pneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus was added.",

Firstly, SNOMED CT is a poly-hierarchy (one concept can have multiple parents), while ICD is a strict hierarchy (one parent per code). A strict hierarchy is necessary in a statistical classification, to avoid double counting. ICD codes for similar diseases can be assigned (somewhat arbitrarily) to different sub-branches or chapters, making it a challenge to find them all. To identify all hypertensive patients, one might be tempted to use the codes under 401\u2013405 Hypertensive disease, but will find that set is missing codes like 410.9 Myocardial infarction with hypertension and 642 Hypertension complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium.

By focusing on the frequently used terms, we made the mapping effort more manageable.

Moreover, starting from a common subset reduces variability between local terminologies and improves interoperability. Detailed statistics about SNOMED CT implementation are difficult to find in the literature.4 Based on the 2011 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) user annual reports, 823 users have used the CORE Subset, about 40% of them in relation to the EHR.",

It is likely that one would see a lower overall coverage of local terms in a dataset where not all the terms are mappable to SNOMED CT. On the other hand, the high usage coverage is consistent with our results. For the three smallest datasets (IH, RI, and BI), which are comparable to the Wright dataset, the average usage coverage was 90.8%.",

One prerequisite for convergence is that frequently used concepts are clustered and not randomly distributed in SNOMED CT. There is evidence for such clustering. A CORE Subset of approximately 5000 concepts, corresponding to only 5% of SNOMED CT clinical concepts, already covers 80% of the frequently used concepts in any dataset. Furthermore, over half of the frequently used concepts not covered are direct parents or children of CORE concepts.
