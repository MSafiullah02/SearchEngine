Prospective cohort study started on March 25 th 2020 for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy. Arterial and central venous blood samples were contemporary collected to calculate the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentration within 24 h from tracheal intubation (T 0 ), and 24 hours after canakinumab administration (T 1 ). Results. At the T 0 19/21 (90.5%) patients showed a pathologic Delta a-cv lactate (median 0.22 mmol/L; IQR 0.07-0.36), suggesting severe inflammation. In the 13 patients undergoing canakinumab administration, at the T 1 Delta a-cv lactate decreased in 92.3% of cases, being the decrease statistically significant (T 0 : median 0.15, IQR 0.07-0.25 mmol/L; T 1 : median -0.01, IQR -0.09-0.04 mmol/L; p=0.002).",

Less is known about the meaning of a Delta a-cv lactate reversal (a-cv difference > 0 mmol/L), which could reflect a derangement in the lung cells mitochondrial metabolism induced by inflammation or other uncoupling mediators, likely to be responsible for the large lung parenchymal disruption (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]like) [6] . Indeed, patients affected by severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia usually present with a first phase of disease characterized by acute viremia (fever, cough, myalgia), followed by a second one, where lung injury is mainly caused by severe inflammation due to a massive release of cytokines ('cytokines storm') [7] . Administration of anti-inflammatory drugs (immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies) such as tocilizumab and canakinumab have been proposed to limit the 'storm effect' and therefore reduce lung damage [8] . Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted at interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta which is used as treatment of the juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other autoinflammatory conditions [9] [10] [11] [12] . Canakinumab is a relatively new biologic agent and so far its clinical use has been limited to autoimmune diseases. Our hypothesis is that the lung injury could be well depicted by an abnormal lactate a-cv gradient, while the antiinflammatory effect of canakinumab, if any, could be mirrored by a reduction of that parameter. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the correlation between the lactate a-cv gradient and the use of Canakinumab. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Both samples were analyzed with an Automatic QC gas Analyzer (Siemens, Munich, Germany) and, the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentration were calculated. PaO 2 and PaCO 2 were also measured and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was determined. Serum interleukin 6 (IL-6, pg/ml), creatinine (mg/dl) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, U/L) levels were also measured at the same time. Since the laboratory simply reported IL-6 as '> 1000' when its concentration exceeded this threshold, a concentration of 1000 pg/ml was considered for analysis purposes in these cases. Canakinumab (Ilaris -Novartis) 300 mg was administered by subcutaneous route in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation because of severe pneumonia caused by the COVID-19. Delta a-cv lactate was reassessed 24 h after drug administration in patients treated with canakinumab.",
