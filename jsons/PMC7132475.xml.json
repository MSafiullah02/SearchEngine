There has been a renewed focus on the disaster literature, following other infectious disease outbreak situations, and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 in particular (Kain and Fowler, 2019), but end-of-life care planning within this rarely features. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has presented a new scenario given the large numbers dying worldwide from in critical care units, or makeshift units. Following the H1N1 outbreak and a surge in critical care demand, Downar et al. (2010) described the need for a palliative pandemic plan, with a view to providing palliative care outside the critical care unit. Downar et al. (2010, p 293) outlines four key aspects; Stuff (stockpiling equipment and palliative medication such as opioids, anti-psychotics for delirium/nausea, antimuscarinic agents for secretions and syringe drivers, sub-cutaneous butterflies for medication administration); Staff (identifying staff with expertise, education, preparing protocols and guidelines for practice, ensuring grief/bereavement counsellors), Space (maximising existing palliative care beds/hospice facilities and identifying non-clinical areas appropriate for large numbers of people to die) and Systems (ensure advance care plans and care plans in place, triage for specialist palliative care, liaison across provider networks to access knowledge and facilitate direct access for clinicians needing consultation support).",

Focusing on ward-based patient care, the guidance defers to critical care expertise around ventilatory withdrawal. These principles are already described in the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) (2019) end of life care in critical care guidance. However, in a pandemic situation, teams do not have the luxury of providing the best end-of-life care possible as advocated in the literature and guidance (Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, 2019, Pattison and Campbell, 2016, Pattison et al., 2013). Adjustments have to be made, and expectations altered.",

            "text": "End-of-life care in these scenarios is pressured by rapid bed turnover, far exceeding usual bed pressures. COVID ventilation practices focus on limiting lung damage and minimising staff risk, and withdrawal of ventilation at end of life also has to minimise any risk to staff of aerosol exposure. Extubation, practiced at end of life in many countries but less commonly in the UK, is an aerosol generating procedure and may have to be reconsidered above turning off ventilators. Nurses and teams have to provide care in extreme situations, and may even be providing care in critical care which is outside their area of usual practice. Offering clear, accurate and consistent communication to patient and families at end of life in critical care in this situation is challenging, with senior critical care nurses bearing much of the brunt of managing these scenarios. Having access to equipment to provide supportive end of life care, such as syringe drivers outlined above, is also increasingly difficult as demand for supplies increases day on day while we approach the height of the pandemic. Creative care planning can help mitigate some of these challenges, and staggering end of life care and withdrawal across units to ensure nurses can be fully present with patients as they are dying. Initiatives such as critical care gardens (Alexander and Tantam, 2020, BBC) are being expedited to ensure patients have humanising experiences in the midst of an unfolding disaster, and that end-of-life care provided is as good as it possibly can be. Ensuring a critical care nursing presence, an interpersonal process characterised by sensitivity, intimacy, vulnerability alongside empathy and holistic care, is key to this (Finfgeld-Connett, 2008). Critical care nurses are swiftly finding alternative ways to communicate with families, such as videoconferencing, as most families will not be present, given pandemic visiting restrictions in place across critical care units worldwide. Bad news may have to be broken this way. In these challenging times, person-centred critical care nursing and high quality, empathic communication at end of life becomes most important.",

Families bereaved in critical care experience worse outcomes, with a greater prevalence of PTSD (44%) and prolonged grief disorder (complicated grief) (52%) at six months than seen in the general population, which is around 5\u201310% (Fujisawa et al., 2010, Kentish-Barnes et al., 2015, Lundorff et al., 2017).

            "text": "Unexpected death is a marked feature of coronavirus-related death, and this feature of bereavement can lead to maladaptive coping and difficulty adjusting. These bereavement experiences are compounded by the fact that most families will not have been permitted to say their goodbyes in person. Nurses and doctors in critical care are having to inform families of bereavement by phone, or share last moments via teleconferencing and videoconferencing facilities, placing an enormous emotional and psychological burden on teams and individuals, as well as families. Usual meaning-making practices, so important for bereavement adjustment (Park, 2010, Milman et al., 2019), such as fingerprinting, hair locks and patient diaries are harder, if not impossible altogether, to carry out. There is also a social legacy in disaster-related deaths, like in this pandemic. Collective grief, as seen in situations of high-profile deaths and disaster situations (K\u00fcbler-Ross and Kessler, 2005), is a recognised phenomenon, with shared mourning through bonding with strangers who have undergone a similar bereavement. This is really important for us to consider in terms of how we shape and provide bereavement support around COVID-related deaths. As K\u00fcbler-Ross and Kessler (2005) suggest, trauma in such circumstances invites us to learn about our strength, endurance and eventually reach hope.",
