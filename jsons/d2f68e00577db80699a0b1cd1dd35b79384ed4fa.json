Thus, we initiated a baseline study to compare demographics, management and outcomes of severely injured patients between Southern Finland and Northern Estonia utilizing regional trauma repositories. Methods A comparison of data fields of the Helsinki University Hospital trauma registry (HTR) and trauma registry at the North Estonia Medical Centre in Tallinn (TTR) between 1/1/2015 and 31/12/2016 was performed. The inclusion criterion was Injury Severity Score > 15. Transferred patients, patients with penetrating injuries, and pediatric patients were excluded. The data for comparison included demographics, Trauma Score-Injury Severity Score (TRISS), mortality, and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Primary outcome was mortality and SMR per TRISS methodology. Results During the 2-year study period, 324 patients from the HTR and 152 from the TTR were included. Demographic profile was similar between the repositories with the exception of severe abdominal injuries being more prevalent at the TTR (25.0% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.002). Predominant injury mechanism was non-ground level fall in both repositories. Mortality was similar at 14.5% and 13.6% at the TTR and HTR, respectively (adj. p = 0.762; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64-1.99). SMR was lower at the HTR compared to the TTR (0.65 vs. 0.77, p > 0.05), however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Benchmarking trauma repositories at a national level provides opportunities for quality and performance improvements. We observed comparable demographic profile and outcome indicators in the compared regional trauma systems.",

            "text": "The overall demographic profile of the two cohorts was similar with a sole exception of a higher admission rate of severe abdominal injuries at the Estonian system that may result from greater proportion of non-ground level falls resulting in higher energy transfer and more frequent Non-ground level falls and GLF contribute to the most of the cases in both regions and similar results have been reported by other authors from European trauma centers [10, 11] . GLF as a trauma mechanism may appear \"insignificant\", however, frequently resulting in serious injuries especially in the head and cervical region [12, 13] . A study by Velmahos et al. reported that during a 9-month study period 37% of patients admitted to a Level I trauma center after GLF or low-level fall had significant injuries often requiring ICU admission [12] . An independent risk factor for significant injuries was older age, thus, both our study regions are at a \"risk group\" with a rather high mean age and significant proportion of GLF-particularly in Southern Finland with almost quarter of the patients being older than 65 years. Also, frequent use of anticoagulants among elderly population exposes to a higher risk for hemorrhage.",

A recent study by Haltmeier et al. investigating patients with severe isolated head injury and field GCS < 9 reported significantly higher mortality for patients with pre-hospital endotracheal intubation compared to patients without pre-hospital intubation performed [15] . A study by Bossers and colleagues observed that outcome of pre-hospital intubation depends on the skills and experience of the pre-hospital providers and should be abandoned when a provider lacks ample training [16] . In the current study, the pre-hospital intubation rate was notably higher in the Finnish trauma system. The causality for this observation is unclear and may be related to greater transportation distances at the catchment area of the HUH and more frequent presence of a physician on the scene. However, as TTR does not register if the on-scene care provider was a paramedic or physician, a detailed analysis is not feasible, thus, this serves as a quality improvement purpose for the TTR to add a data field to record if a paramedic or physician was on-scene. None of the severely injured patients in Estonia were transported by helicopter compared to almost 5% helicopter transportations in Southern Finland. However, the subject is still controversial and a recent Cochrane Database metaanalysis could not find clear benefits of helicopter transportation due to lack of high-quality evidence and heterogeneity of the studies [17] . Nevertheless, there may be a potential benefit for certain subgroups of patients transported from highways distant to the hospital or during rush hours, potentially decreasing pre-hospital times [18] .",

Also, both regions showed better outcome compared to predicted mortality per TRISS methodology, however, due to relatively low number of cases the SMR should be interpreted with caution.

One of the most important limitations is simplistic dichotomous stratification of age variable: \u2264 55 and > 55 years. With increasing average of life-expectancy and evolving medical care make such a strict cut-off per age questionable. Also, some authors have shown that TRISS performance is low for traumatic brain injuries and for certain mechanisms of injuries. Kennedy and co-authors noted that TRISS methodology has a poor performance for patients after low-level falls [19] .
