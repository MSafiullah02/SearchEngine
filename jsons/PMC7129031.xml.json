The investigators used a cross-sectional design that tested serum samples from about 10 000 people in Saudi Arabia whose age and sex distribution was similar to that of the general population. By use of a rigorous serological testing algorithm, the investigators identified MERS-CoV antibodies in 15 (0\u00b715%, 95% CI 0\u00b709\u20130\u00b724) of 10 009 samples from the general population. Men had a significantly higher proportion of infections (11 [0\u00b725%] of 4341) than did women (two [0\u00b705%] of 4378; p=0\u00b7025), and more infections were noted in central rural areas than in coastal provinces (14 [0\u00b726%] of 5479 vs one [0\u00b702%] of 4529; p=0\u00b7003). The investigators also obtained samples from camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers, and showed that seroprevalence of MERS-CoV was 15\u201323 times higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. The findings from this study suggest that young men in Saudi Arabia who have contact with camels in cultural or occupational settings are becoming infected with MERS-CoV, often without being diagnosed, and might proceed to introduce the virus to the general population in which more severe illness triggers testing for the virus and disease recognition. This hypothesis could account for cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome without previous animal exposure.",
