            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a eukaryotic organelle that forms an interconnected network of tubules, vesicles, and cisternae within cells. The general structure of the ER is an extensive membrane network of cisternae (sac-like structures) held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses a space, the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum vary greatly depending on the exact type of endoplasmic reticulum and the type of cell in which it resides. The ER is the entry station for all proteins of the synthetic/secretory pathway and consists of nuclear envelope, rough ER (rER), smooth ER (sER), transitional ER (tER), and intermediate compartment (IC) (Marie et al. 2009; Lippincott-Schwartz et al. 2000). Rough endoplasmic reticula synthesize proteins, while smooth endoplasmic reticula synthesize lipids and steroids, metabolize carbohydrates and steroids, and regulate calcium concentration, drug metabolism, and attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins. Different subcompartments of ER have characteristic biochemical and physiological properties and they serve specific subcellular functions. Structurally ER is seen as a three-dimensional, reticular network of continuous tubules and sheets creating the largest membranous organelle of the cell. Functionally ER is responsible for the synthesis and processing of secreted proteins, membrane proteins and organelle resident proteins. The ER is also part of a protein sorting pathway and seen as a compartment that participates in the assembly, sorting, and degradation of proteins as well as in the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration (Harter and Wieland 1996). It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. From ER, properly folded and assembled proteins are further transported via IC to the Golgi complex by specific carrier vesicles which bud on the ER and move to cis-Golgi membranes. Folded proteins may remain in the ER if it is their home compartment or else they are transported to the secretory pathway. COPII, a coat complex which forms a main structure of transport vesicles, is responsible for forward transport of cargo from the ER to Golgi complex. COPI vesicles in their turn carry cargo between Golgi and ER and in intra-Golgi transport (Barlowe et al. 1994; Letourneur et al. 1994; Schekman and Orci 1996). Sorting of synthesized proteins at the ER occurs by selective incorporation of secretory and membrane proteins into vesicles that bud from the ER (Pelham 1996; Wieland and Harter 1999). The majority of ER resident proteins are retained in the ER through a specific carboxy terminal retention motif. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequence is KDEL (lys-asp-glu-leu). However, variation on KDEL does occur and other sequences can also give rise to ER retention. There are three KDEL receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established. The lumenal soluble proteins of the ER carry a specific carboxyterminal KDEL signal which prevents the secretion of these proteins. Those ER-resident KDEL proteins which have escaped the ER, are recycled back from the Golgi to ER by COPI vesicles (Poussu 2001). Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the ER membrane. Proteins that are transported by the ER and from there throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Proteins that are destined for places outside the ER are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination.",

            "text": "The Golgi is a stack of polarized tubular/saccular compartments with a defined cis- to trans content reflecting the presence of specialized processing enzymes that extensively modify newly synthesized proteins. The membrane-bound stacks are known as cisternae (singular: cisterna). Between four and eight stacks are usually present, although, in some protists as many as 60 have been observed. Each cisterna comprises a flattened membrane disk, and carries Golgi enzymes to help or to modify cargo proteins that travel through them. They are found in both plant and animal cells and the overall morphology of the ER-Golgi system can vary between cell types such as in budding to higher eukaryotes. The Golgi has earlier been viewed as a static station for the processing of secretory material, but now it seems that Golgi undergoes continuous remodeling. Traditionally, Golgi has been viewed as a series of stable compartments, named the cis-, medial- and trans-Golgi, as well as TGN (Glick 2000). The trans- face of the trans-Golgi network is the face from which vesicles leave the Golgi. These vesicles then proceed to later compartments such as the cell membrane, secretory vesicles or late endosomes. New cisternae form at the cis-Golgi network. The cis- and trans-Golgi networks are thought to be specialised cisternae leading in and out of the Golgi apparatus.",

The Golgi apparatus plays an important role at the crossroads of the secretory pathway. It receives freshly synthesized proteins and lipids from the ER, modifies them, and then distributes cargo to various destinations. Proteins coming from ER to Golgi enter the organ on its tubulovesicular cis-face, travel across the stacks, and leave the Golgi on its trans-face. Cis-Golgi network not only receives the material from the ER but is also involved in sorting and recycling of lipids and proteins to the ER. On the way through the Golgi, newly synthesized glycoproteins are subjected to several posttranslational modifications such as ordered remodeling of their N-linked oligosaccharide side chains and biosynthesis of O-linked glycans. To effect such modifications, the Golgi complex is organized as polarized stacks of flattened cisternae enriched in transmembrane processing enzymes. To be able to send cargo even long distances through the cytoplasm, the Golgi complex is closely associated with the cytoskeleton. It is situated around the microtubule organizing center and is surrounded by actin cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins (Holleran and Holzbaur 1998).",

For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. The Golgi plays an important role in the synthesis of proteoglycans, which are molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals. It is also a major site of carbohydrate synthesis. This includes the production of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), long unbranched polysaccharides which the Golgi then attaches to a protein synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum to form proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi polymerize several of these GAGs via a xylose link onto the core protein. Another task of the Golgi involves the sulfation of certain molecules passing through its lumen via sulphotranferases that gain their sulphur molecule from a donor called PAPs. This process occurs on the GAGs of proteoglycans as well as on the core protein. The level of sulfation is very important to the proteoglycans\u2019 signalling abilities as well as giving the proteoglycan its overall negative charge.",

            "text": "The trans-Golgi network is the site of the sorting and final exit of cargo from the Golgi. It refers to the trans-side of the Golgi and structurally it is seen as a sacculotubular network. The structure and the size of TGN varies remarkably from one cell type to another: in cells with a low number of secretory granules but with an extensive lysosomal system, TGN is massive, while secretory cells showing small or large secretory granules typically possess small TGN or even lack it (Clermont et al. 1995). Newly synthesized proteins traverse the Golgi stack until they reach the TGN. The trans-Golgi network sorts the proteins into several types of vesicles. Clathrin-coated vesicles carry certain proteins to lysosomes. At TGN, cargo molecules are sequestered into coated vesicles and directed to their correct destinations. For example, proteins with specific recognition signals are packed into clathrin-coated vescicles (CCVs) and transported to endosomal/lysosomal system in a selective pathway (Marks et al. 1997). Proteins carrying specific sorting signals are targeted and transported to plasma membrane through a so-called constitutive pathway (Pearse and Robinson 1990). In specialized cells producing large quantities of particular products in response to extracellular stimuli (e.g. hormonal or neural stimuli), there exists another secretion pathway leading to cell surface called the regulated secretory pathway (Traub and Kornfeld 1997). Other proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles for immediate delivery to the cell surface. Still other proteins are packaged into secretory granules, which undergo regulated secretion in response to specific signals. The sorting function of the Golgi apparatus allows the various organelles to grow while maintaining their distinct identities.",

            "text": "Protein traffic moving from ER to Golgi complex in mammalian cells passes through the tubulovesicular membrane clusters of the ERGIC, the marker of which is the lectin ERGIC-53. Because the functional borders of the intermediate compartment (IC) are not well defined, the spatial map of the transport machineries operating between the ER and the Golgi apparatus remains incomplete (Fig. 3.1). However, studies showed that the IC consists of interconnected vacuolar and tubular parts with specific roles in pre-Golgi trafficking. The identification of ERGIC-53 has added to the complexity of the exocytic pathway of higher eukaryotic cells. Ffractional analysis of the ERGIC from Vero cells suggested that in the secretory pathway of Vero cells O-glycan initiation and sphingomyelin as well as glucosylceramide synthesis mainly occur beyond the ERGIC in the Golgi apparatus (Schweizer et al. 1994; Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri 2006). Marie et al. (2009) provided novel insight into the compartmental organization of the secretory pathway and Golgi biogenesis, in addition to a direct functional connection between the IC and the endosomal system, which evidently contributes to unconventional transport of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the cell surface. The ERGIC defined by ERGIC-53 also participates in the maturation of (or is target for) several viruses such as corona virus, cytomegalovirus, flavivirus, poliovirus, Uukuniemi virus, and vaccinia virus. Understanding the targeting of viruses and viral proteins to the ERGIC could lead to development of general approaches for viral interference. Further analysis of the ERGIC-53 as a marker protein should provide novel results about the mechanisms controlling traffic in the secretory pathway (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_7).",

In addition, cells contain numerous clathrin/adaptor complexes\u2014with each coat budding vesicles from a discrete subcellular location. COPII has been implicated in the selective packaging of anterograde cargo into coated transport vesicles budding from ER. In higher eukaryotes, transport from the ER is initiated by COPII mediated budding of vesicular carriers, but this is restricted to specialized, long-lived subdomains of the ER, the ER-exit sites (ERES). ERGIC clusters containing ERGIC-53 are close to but clearly distinct from ERES and delineate the subsequent stage in transport to the Golgi. The ERES are thought to generate transit vesicles and pleiomorphic tubular carriers through the activity of COPII coat machinery to yield pre-Golgi intermediates. In mammalian cells, these vesicles coalesce to form tubulo-vesicular transport complexes (TCs), which shuttle anterograde cargo from the ER to Golgi complex.",

These structures appear heterogenous and move in a microtubule-dependent manner toward the Golgi complex. These results suggest a sequential mode of COPII and COPI action and indicate that the transport complexes are ER-to-Golgi transport intermediates from which COPI may be involved in recycling material to the ER (Scales et al. 2000).",

Specific cargos are recruited into clathrin-coated vesicles with the aid of CLASP proteins (clathrin-associated sorting proteins), such as ARH and Dab2. Clathrin-associated protein complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. At least 20 clathrin adaptors have been identified, which share a common design composed of a compact domain plus a long unstructured region that binds the clathrin beta-propeller. The two major types of clathrin adaptor complexes are: heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes, and the monomeric GGA (Golgi-localising, \u03b3-adaptin ear domain homology, ARF-binding proteins) adaptors. Whereas clathrin heavy chain provides the structural backbone of the clathrin coat, it was suggested that clathrin light chains (CLCs) are not required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis but are critical for clathrin-mediated trafficking between the TGN and the endosomal system. In CLC-deficient mice CI-MPRs cluster near the TGN leading to a delay in processing of the lysosomal cathepsin D. In mammalian cells CLCs function in intracellular membrane trafficking by acting as recruitment proteins for huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R), enabling HIP1R to regulate actin assembly on clathrin-coated structures (Poupon et al. 2008).",

AP complexes connect cargo proteins and lipids to clathrin at vesicle budding sites, as well as binding accessory proteins that regulate coat assembly and disassembly. There are different AP complexes in mammals. AP1 is responsible for the transport of lysosomal hydrolases between the TGN and endosomes. AP2 associates with the plasma membrane and is responsible for endocytosis. The AP-1 and AP-2 complexes are the most abundant adaptors in CCVs, but clathrin-mediated trafficking can still occur in the absence of any detectable AP-1 or AP-2. AP3 is responsible for protein trafficking to lysosomes and other related organelles. AP4 is less well characterised. AP-4 is localized mainly in the Golgi complex, as well as on endosomes and transport vesicles. Mammary epithelial cells contain an unexpectedly high quantity of clathrin coated vesicles. Analysis of CCV adaptor composition showed that approximately 5\u201310% of total APs consist of AP-2 in mammary gland CCV whereas it represents approximately 70% of the total APs from bovine brain CCV. Relatively high quantities of furin and CI-MPR were detected in mammary CCV. AP-1 and the CI-MPR were localized in Golgi-associated vesicles and on the membrane of secretory vesicles. CCV in lactating mammary epithelial cells are involved in the transcytotic pathway, in sorting at the TGN and in the biogenesis of casein-containing secretory vesicles (Pauloin et al. 1999).",

            "text": "The main function of lysosomes in the cell is the degradation of internalized material by lysosomal enzymes, the acid hydrolases. These enzymes are synthesized in the ER and during their maturation in the Golgi apparatus they acquire the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. Most of these soluble hydrolases are transported to lysosomes through specific M6P receptors. The receptor-enzyme complexes segregated in TGN are transferred to the lysosomal compartments via the secretory pathway through clathrin-coated vesicles.In mammalian cells, the targeting of newly synthesized hydrolases, as well as others ligands with M6P residues on their N-linked oligosaccharides, to the lysosomes depends on their recognition by two specific M6P receptors at the TGN: the cation-dependent M6P receptor (CD-MPR) and the cation-independent M6P receptor (CI-MPR), also called mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor in eutherian mammals, in which it binds IGF-II (Kornfeld 1992; Varki and Kornfeld 2009) (Fig. 3.2). These two receptors (M6PRs) are considered sorting receptors because of their routing function. In the pre-lysosomal compartment, acidity induces release of enzymes from both MPR, which are then recycled into the Golgi apparatus. However, the CI-MPR, which participates to this cellular routing, is also anchored to the cell surface membrane and can internalize extracellular ligands (Kornfeld 1992; Munier-Lehmann et al. 1996; Dahms 1996\n). Thus, the pool of lysosomal acid hydrolases comes both from in situ synthesis, which involves the two M6P receptors, and from endocytosis through the CI-MPR (Ni et al. 2006; Nykjaer et al. 1998). It is now well accepted that the TGN is the major site where proteins are sorted from the biosynthetic pathway for efficient delivery to endosomes. There, the MPRs and their bound ligands are segregated into nascent clathrin-coated vesicles, probably together with other transmembrane proteins destined to the endosomes/lysosomes. After budding and uncoating, these Golgi-derived vesicles fuse with endosomal compartments where the MPRs discharge their bound ligands. While the soluble lysosomal enzymes are directed toward the lysosomes, the MPRs recycle back to the TGN (Duncan and Kornfeld 1988) or to the cell surface where they are found in small amounts at steady state. At the plasma membrane, the MPRs undergo endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits like many other cell surface receptors (Fig. 3.1).\n",

Both receptors localize to hepatocytes at all ages and, additionally, the CD-MPR was reactive in megakaryocytes at early stages. In adult rat liver, CIMPR is detected intensely in hepatocytes and weakly in sinusoidal Kupffer cells and interstitial cells in Glisson\u2019s capsule. A high level of expression of CI-MPR mRNAs in hepatocytes and of CD-MPR mRNA in Kupffer cells was detected by in situ hybridization. Differential changes during perinatal development and adults suggest that two MPRs play distinct roles during organ maturation (Romano et al. 2006; Waguri et al. 2001). It was found that the activity of glycosidases changes during development, reaching a peak at the tenth day after birth and correlated with the expression and binding properties of CD-MPR. It was suggested that lysosome maturation in rat liver occurs around tenth day after birth, and that the CD-MPR may participate in that event. In hepatocytes of MPR-deficient neonatal mice, lysosomal storage occurs when both MPRs are lacking, whereas deficiency of CI-MPR only has no effect on the ultrastructure of the lysosomal system (Schellens et al. 2003). A biochemical comparison between autophagosomes and amphisomes from rat liver showed that the amphisomes were enriched in early endosome markers [the asialoglycoprotein receptor and the early endosome-associated protein as well as in a late endosome marker (CI-MPR)]. Amphisomes would thus seem to be capable of receiving inputs both from early and late endosomes (Berg et al. 1998). In human HepG2 and BHK cells, the two receptors were identified at the same sites: the trans-Golgi reticulum (TGR), endosomes, electron-dense cytoplasmic vesicles, and the plasma membrane. It was suggested that the two MPRs exit TGR via same coated vesicles. However, on arrival in the endosomes CD-MPR is more rapidly than CI-MPR segregated into associated tubules and vesicles (ATV) which probably are destined to recycle MPRs to TGR (Klumperman et al. 1993).",

Although intense reactivities of both MPRs were observed in the same groups of neurons in the same regions, the spatial differences in immunoreactive intensity for CI-MPR were greater, particularly in the telencephalon such as the basal forebrain and cerebral cortex, than those for CD-MPR. While CD-MPR is ubiquitously necessary for the general function of neurons, the CI-MPR is selectively necessary for certain region- and neurotransmitter-specific functions of neurons (Konishi et al. 2005). In rat brain during perinatal development, the expression of CI-MPR decreases progressively from fetuses to adults, where as CD-MPR increases around the tenth day of birth, and maintained there after. This shows that the two receptors play a different role in rat brain during perinatal development; CD-MPR being mostly involved in lysosome maturation (Romano et al. 2005). Given the critical role of endosomal-lysosomal (EL) system in the clearance of abnormal proteins, it is likely that the increase in the CI-MPR and components of the EL system in surviving neurons after 192-IgG-saporin represents an adaptive mechanism to restore the metabolic/structural abnormalities induced by the loss of cholin-ergic neurons (Hawkes et al. 2006).",

Osteoclast expresses large amounts of immunoreactive CI-MPR, despite the fact that most of the lysosomal enzymes it synthesizes are secreted. In osteoclast, M6P receptors are involved in the vectorial transport and targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, presumably via a constitutive pathway, to the apical membrane where they are secreted into the bone-resorbing compartment. This mechanism could insure polarized secretion of lysosomal enzymes into the bone-resorbing lacuna (Baron 1989). The rapid inhibition of bone resorption by calcitonin involves the vesicular translocation of the apical membranes and the rapid arrest in the synthesis and secretion of lysosomal enzymes in osteoclasts (Baron et al. 1990). IGF2R/CI-MPR is present in rat calvarial osteoblasts. Osteoblasts bind IGF-II with high affinity (KD ~ 2.0 nM). The osteoblastic Ca2+ response to IGF-II is caused by an intracellular release of Ca2+ which is mediated by the IGF-II/CI-MPR (Martinez et al. 1995). The phosphorylated monosaccharide, M6P stimulates alkaline phosphatase produced by osteoblasts. Glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1-phosphate also stimulated osteoblast alkaline phosphatase production, but not to the same extent as M6P. Since, the stimulatory effect of M6P is similar to that of IGF-II, it supports similar mechanism for signal transduction for both IGF-II and M6P (Ishibe et al. 1991).",

The Tg has been shown to be phosphorylated and to carry M6P signal in terminal position. In porcine thyroid follicle cells, the CI-MPR is primarily located in elements of the endocytic pathway such as coated pits and endosomes. This localization of the CI-MPR in thyrocytes differs from the receptor sites in other cell types by the rare occurrence of CI-MPR in cisternae of the Golgi complex. The CI-MPR in thyrocytes might be unable to bind and to convey Tg efficiently. The receptor is, however, a binding site for Tg at the apical plasma membrane and may, therefore, be involved in the binding of Tg and its transfer from the follicle lumen to lysosomes (Lemansky and Herzog 1992; Scheel and Herzog 1989). Using antibodies against Tg and CI-MPR, Kostrouch et al. (1991) suggested three types of endocytic structures: those slightly positive for MPR and ArS-A, those strongly positive for both markers, and those only positive for ArS-A. These compartments exhibited the properties of early endosomes (EE), late endosomes (LE), and lysosomes (L), respectively. The data indicate that internalized Tg molecules are transported to EE and then transferred from EE to LE.",

Like germ cells, Sertoli cells in primary culture endocytosed 125I-M6P-bearing ligands at levels that were about 10% of the endocytic activity measured for 3T3 fibroblasts. This indicates that both spermatogenic and Sertoli cells have surface MPRs capable of mediating endocytosis (O\u2018Brien et al. 1989, 1993). Tsuruta and O\u2019Brien (1995) and Tsuruta et al.

Multiple CD-MPR transcripts were detected in these cells, including a 2.4-kb CD-MPR mRNA that was indistinguishable from CD-MPR transcripts in somatic tissues and Sertoli cells.

Evidence is also presented that the CI-phosphomannosyl receptors are responsible for the interaction with alpha-mannosidase. These findings suggest a new role for extracellular transport mediated by the M6P receptor. Both MPRs undergo changes in distribution as spermatozoa passed from rete testis to cauda epididymis. CI-MPR was concentrated in the dorsal region of the head in rete testis sperm and that this labeling extended to the equatorial segment of epididymal spermatozoa. CD-MPR, however, changed from a dorsal distribution in rete testis, caput, and corpus to a double labeling on the dorsal and ventral regions in cauda spermatozoa; staining for either CI-MPR or CD-MPR increased from rete testis to epididymis. Changes in MPRs distribution may be related to a maturation process, which suggests new roles for the phosphomannosyl receptors (Belmonte et al. 2000).

The receptors from human and rat liver are antigenically related. Both are immunologically distinct from the CI-MPR of 215-kDa from human liver. The CD receptor exists in solution as a dimer or tetramer (Dahms and Hancock 2002). Modification of arginine and histidine residues reduced the binding of the receptor to immobilized ligands. Presence of M6P during modification of arginine residues protected the binding properties of the receptor, suggesting that arginine is a constituent of the M6P binding site of the receptor (Stein et al. 1987c). PC12 cells express CI-MPR, but not CD-MPR as much.

The microsomal membranes containing the receptor and the location of the five potential N-linked glycosylation sites indicate that the receptor is a transmembrane protein with an extracytoplasmic amino terminus. This extracytoplasmic domain is homologous to the approximately 145 amino acid long repeating domains present in the 215-kDa CI-MPR (Dahms et al. 1987). The full-length cDNA for the goat CD-MPR46 protein was expressed in MPR deficient cells. It exhibits oligomeric nature as observed in the other species. The binding and sorting functions of the expressed protein to sort cathepsin D to lysosomes were similar to natural protein (Poupon et al. 2007). 46-kDa MPR mediates transport of endogenous but not endocytosis of exogenous lysosomal enzymes. Internalization of receptor antibodies indicated that the failure to mediate endocytosis of lysosomal enzymes is due to an inability of surface 46-kDa MPR to bind ligands rather than its exclusion from the plasma membrane or from internalization (Stein et al. 1987a, b).",

No correlation between the genomic organization and known protein domains of the MPR46 was apparent (Klier et al. 1991). Moreover, the sequence of about 150 amino acids within the luminal domain of MPR46, which is homologous to the 15 repeats that constitute the luminal domain of the MPR300, does not correlate with intron/exon borders.

Both are present at one copy per haploid genome and map to chromosomes 6 and 3, respectively. Comparison of the complete 10-kb sequence of the functional gene with the cDNA indicates that it contains seven exons. Exon 1 encodes the 5\u2032-untranslated region of the mRNA, the others (exons 2\u20137) encode the luminal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of the CD-MPR. Exon 7 also contains a 1.2-kb-long 3\u2032-untranslated region of the mRNA. A unique transcription-initiation site was determined by primer extension of mouse liver mRNA. The promoter elements in the 5\u2032 upstream region of this site resemble those contained in genes constitutively transcribed. However, Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the CD-MPR is variably expressed in adult mouse tissues and during mouse development. The pseudogene, which is flanked by direct repeats, is almost colinear with the cDNA indicating that it presumably arose by reverse transcription of an mRNA. However, the pseudogene differs from the cDNA. It contains at its 5\u2032 end, an additional 340-nucleotide (nt) sequence homologous to the promoter region of the functional gene. This sequence exhibits some promoter activity in vitro. Furthermore, a 24-nt insertion interrupts the region homologous to the 5\u2032-noncoding region of the cDNA. In the functional gene, this 24-nt sequence occurs between exon 1 and 2, where it is flanked by typical consensus sequences of exon/intron boundaries. Therefore, it may represent an additional exon of the functional gene. These two features of the pseudogene suggest that expression of the CD-MPR gene may be regulated by use of different promoters and/or alternative splicing.",

CD-MPR mutants lacking various potential glycosylation sites showed that the presence of a single oligosaccharide chain, particularly at position 87 significantly enhanced its M6P-binding ability when compared with non-glycosylated receptors. It was suggested that N-glycosylation of the bovine CD-MPR facilitates the folding of the nascent polypeptide chain into a conformation that is conducive for intracellular transport and ligand binding (Zhang and Dahms 1993). A soluble truncated form CD-MPR encoding only the extracytoplasmic region, Stop155, and a truncated glycosylation-deficient form of the CD-MPR, Asn81/Stop155, which has been modified to contain only one N-linked glycosylation site at position 81 instead of five, were purified from baculovirus-infected High Five insect cells. The extracellular region of the CD-MPR is sufficient for high-affinity binding and that oligosaccharides at positions 31, 57, and 87 do not influence ligand binding (Marron-Terada et al. 1998). The recombinant insect-produced CD-MPR existed as a dimer in the membrane. The cytoplasmic domains of the MPRs are sufficient to determine the steady-state distribution of the full-length proteins (Dahms and Hancock 2002; Mauxion et al. 1995).",

The lysosomal enzymes of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum are also recognized by the MPR on these cells; however, none of the oligosaccharides from these enzymes contain two phosphomonoesters. Instead, most contain multiple sulfate esters and two residues of M6P in an unusual PDE linkage. Further study shows that nearly all of the \u03b1-mannosidase molecules contain the oligosaccharides required for uptake, and that each tetrameric, holoenzyme molecule has sufficient carbohydrate for an average of 10 Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides. Results suggest that the interactions of multiple, weakly binding oligosaccharides, especially those with 2 PDE, are important for high rate of uptake of the slime mold enzymes.

Mutant receptors containing a single amino acid substitution toward a lysosomal enzyme showed that substitution of Gln66, Arg111, Glu133, or Tyr143 results in a >800-fold decrease in affinity, suggesting that these four amino acids are essential for carbohydrate recognition by CD-MPR. Furthermore, Asp103 has been identified as the key residue which mediates the effects of divalent cations on the binding properties of the CD-MPR. The MPRs encounter a variety of conditions as they travel to various compartments where they bind and release their ligands. Key to their function is pH-dependence of ligand-protein interaction. Cells treated with reagents that raise the pH of endosomal/lysosomal compartments exhibit decreased sorting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes and a concomitant increase in the secretion of these enzymes into the medium (Imort et al. 1983). This observation implies that it is essential for MPRs to release their ligands in the acidic environment of endosomes in order to be able to recycle back to the TGN to retrieve additional lysosomal enzymes. To determine whether different pH conditions elicit conformational changes in the receptor that alters ligand binding affinities, CD-MPR structures were obtained under different conditions representing various environments encountered by the receptor: bound state at pH 6.5 and pH 7.4 and unbound state at pH 6.5 and pH 4.8 (Olson et al. 2002, 2008) (Fig. 3.4).\n",

Unlike what has been observed in other lectins, the structure of the ligand-free CD-MPR differs considerably from the ligand-bound form in that changes in both quaternary structure and positioning of loops involved in sugar binding, along with changes in the spacing of the two carbohydrate binding sites in the dimeric receptor (the C\u03b1 atoms of His105 located in Loop C are ~34 \u00c5 apart in the open conformation and ~26 \u00c5 apart in the closed conformation). Loop D (residues Glu134\u2013Cys141) exhibits the most dramatic change in position, with Val138 displaying the largest displacement (C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distance of 16 \u00c5). The CD-MPR conformation differs dramatically from other lectins in an unbound state, where water molecules fill the shallow binding grooves of other most lectins in absence of bound sugar. Instead of essential side chain interactions being shifted from the carbohydrate hyroxyls to water, the pocket of CD-MPR undergoes restructuring: loop D swings into the binding pocket in the absence of ligand and provides contacts that hold essential residues in the proper orientation so that they are maintained in a \u201cready-state\u201d to accept ligand. The two conformations also display a dramatic difference in their quaternary structure that can be described globally as a scissoring and twisting motion between the two subunits of the dimer. Results indicate that the CD-MPR is dynamic and must be able to transition between two conformations as it moves to different organelles, with changing environment of each (Dahms et al. 2008; Olson et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Based on these structures, distinct mechanisms for the dissociation of lysosomal enzymes at the cell surface and under the acidic conditions of the endosome were proposed for the CD-MPR (Olson et al. 2008). His105 is the only residue of the receptor in which a titratable side chain is involved in binding the phosphate group of M6P. Deprotonation of His105 and the phosphate moiety of M6P appear to be key elements in the release of ligand at the cell surface: loss of the electrostatic interaction between the uncharged His105 and M6P is predicted to facilitate dissociation of phosphorylated ligands at pH 7.4. In the acidic environment of the endosome, it is proposed that disruption, via protonation, of intermonomer electrostatic interactions that tie loop D of one monomer to the \u03b1-helix of the other monomer in the ligand bound conformation would \u201cfree\u201d loop D to move into the binding pocket, resulting in the displacement of ligand. In addition, protonation of Glu133 that is located in the binding pocket is predicted to weaken its interaction with the 3- or 4-hydroxyl group of M6P and disrupt the electrostatic environment of the entire binding pocket, thereby enhancing the release of M6P. The repositioning of loop D into the binding pocket eliminates its intermonomer interaction with the N-terminal \u03b1-helix. This loss of intermonomer contact may trigger the reorientation of the two monomers as the receptor changes its quaternary structure, adopting a more closed conformation in the unbound state (Dahms et al. 2008; Olson et al. 2008). These results allowed to suggest that the receptor regulates its ligand binding upon changes in pH; the pKa of Glu133 appeared to be responsible for ligand release in the acidic environment of the late endosomal compartment, and the pKa values of the sugar phosphate and His105 were accountable for its inability to bind ligand at the cell surface where the pH was about 7.4.",

            "text": "Sequence comparison between CD-MPR and CI-MPR shows that they are related. In fact, the extracytoplasmic domain of CD-MPR is homologous to the approximately 145 amino acid long repeating domains present in the CI-MPR with sequence identity ranging from 14% to 28%. These studies allowed to conclude that these two receptors located on different chromosomes (12p13 and 6q26, respectively) have diverged from a common ancestral gene (Dahms et al. 1987; Klier et al. 1991). This receptor is a 46 kDa single polypeptide chain that contains a putative signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. The CD-MPR is a single membrane-spanning domain, which separates a N-terminal extracytoplasmic region with five potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites, from a C-terminal cytoplasmic region without Asn-glycosylation sites. Sequence analysis of the bovine CD-MPR revealed that it consists of a 28 amino-acid residue N-terminal signal sequence, a 159 amino acid residue luminal domain, a 25 amino acid residue transmembrane domain and a 67 amino acid residue C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It is highly conserved from mouse to human (93% homology). The CD-MPR appears to be a homodimer at the membrane (Stein et al. 1987a), and either a dimer or a tetramer in solution (Dahms et al. 1987; Tong and Kornfeld 1989; Stein et al. 1987b).",

            "text": "Soluble acid hydrolases constitute a group of over 60 heterogeneous enzymes that differ in size, oligomeric state, number of N-linked oligosaccharides, extent of phosphorylation, and the position of the M6P moiety and its linkage to the penultimate mannose residue in the oligosaccharide chain (Dahms et al. 2008). The two MPRs have been shown to display different affinities and capacities for transport of various acid hydrolases, and both receptors are necessary for the efficient sorting of all lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome as neither MPR can fully compensate for the other (Dahms et al. 2008). These studies indicate that the two MPRs recognize distinct but overlapping populations of acid hydrolases. A proteomic analysis of serum from mutant mice deficient in either the CD-MPR or CI-MPR revealed that several lysosomal proteins are preferentially sorted by the CD-MPR (e.g., tripeptidyl peptidase I) or CI-MPR (e.g., cathepsin D) (Qian et al. 2008). Amine-activated glycans, covalently printed on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated glass slides, interrogated with different concentrations of rCD-MPR or soluble CI-MPR. Neither receptor bound to non-phosphorylated glycans. The CD-MPR bound weakly or undetectably to the phosphodiester derivatives, but strongly to the phosphomonoester-containing glycans with the exception of a single Man7GlcNAc2-R isomer that contained a single M6P residue. By contrast, the CI-MPR bound with high affinity to glycans containing either phospho-mono- or -diesters although, like the CD-MPR, it differentially recognized isomers of phosphorylated Man7GlcNAc2-R. This differential recognition of phosphorylated glycans by the CI- and CD-MPRs has implications for understanding the biosynthesis and targeting of lysosomal hydrolases (Song et al. 2009). Future studies will shed light onto the functional significance of two distinct MPRs in a given cell type.",

            "text": "The CD-MPR and CI-MPR share a number of similarities with respect to carbohydrate recognition. For example, both MPRs bind the M6P with essentially the same affinity (7\u20138 \u00d7 10\u20136 M). Mannose or glucose 6-phosphate interact poorly with the MPRs (Ki = 1\u20135 \u00d7 10\u20132 M) (Tong et al. 1989; Tong and Kornfeld 1989). Like mammalian MPRs, calotes MPR-300/IGF-IIR also binds IGF-II with high affinity (KD ~12.02 nM). A number of synthetic analogs and those with the highest affinity to the CI-MPR were found to be isosteric to M6P. Several M6P analogues with phosphonate, carboxylate or malonate groups displayed a higher affinity and a stronger stability in human serum than M6P itself. These derivatives could be used to favour the delivery of specific therapeutic compounds to lysosomes, notably in enzyme replacement therapies of lysosomal diseases or in neoplastic drug targeting. Although analogues containing two negative charges were the best ligands, the presence of a phosphorous atom was not necessary for recognition (Gary-Bobo et al. 2007). In addition, linear mannose sequences which contain a terminal M6P linked \u03b11, 2 to the penultimate mannose were shown to be the most potent inhibitors (Distler et al. 1991; Tomoda et al. 1991), suggesting that the MPRs bind an extended oliogosaccharide structure which includes the M6P \u03b11,2 Man sequence. The crystal structure of CD-MPR complexed with \u03b11, 2-linked phosphorylated trimannoside has revealed the site of penultimate and prepenultimate mannose rings in the binding pocket and their hydrogen bond interactions with the receptor (Olson et al. 2008). Furthermore, multivalent interactions between the receptor and a lysosomal enzyme result in high affinity binding, of the order of 1\u201310 nM for both MPRs (Dahms et al. 2008; Watanabe et al. 1990). The two MPRs exhibit optimal ligand binding at ~pH 6.4 and no detectable binding below pH 5, which is in accordance with their function of releasing ligands in acidic environment of the endosome.",

            "text": "In contrast to these similarities, the two MPRs differ in their binding properties, which depend on pH, cations, and nature of phosphodiesters. The CI-MPR retains phosphomannosyl binding capabilities at neutral pH which corresponds well with the ability of this receptor to bind and internalize lysosomal enzymes at the cell surface. In contrast, the ligand binding ability of the CD-MPR is dramatically reduced at a pH > 6.4 (Tong et al. 1989; Tong and Kornfeld 1989) which is consistent with its decreased ability to bind and internalize lysosomal enzymes at the cell surface (Stein et al. 1987a, b). The inability to purify the CD-MPR by phosphomannosyl affinity chromatography performed in the absence of cations led to its designation as a \u201ccation-dependent\u201d receptor (Hoflack and Kornfeld 1985a, b). However, the presence of cations increases the binding affinity of the CD-MPR towards M6P (Tong and Kornfeld 1989) and lysosomal enzymes only fourfold (Sun et al. 2005) but has no effect on the binding affinity of CI-MPR. This finding differentiates the CD-MPR from C-type lectins which have an absolute requirement for calcium to carry out their sugar binding activities. Mutagenesis studies (Sun et al. 2005) indicated that a conserved aspartic acid residue at position 103 of the CD-MPR, which is not present in the CI-MPR, necessitates the presence of a divalent cation in the binding pocket to obtain high affinity ligand binding by functioning to neutralize the negative charge of Asp103 juxtaposed to the phosphate oxygen of M6P. The CI-MPR, unlike the CD-MPR, is able to recognize MP-GlcNAc phosphodiesters as well as lysosomal enzymes derived from Dictyostelium discoideum which contain mannose 6-sulfate residues and small methyl phosphodiesters, M6P-OCH3, but not phosphomonoesters (c/r Dahms et al. 2008).",

The binding of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes to the CD-MPR is markedly influenced by pH. At pH 6.3, almost all of the lysosomal enzymes bound to the receptor. Results indicated that at neutral pH the phosphorylated oligosaccharides on some lysosomal enzyme molecules are oriented in a manner which makes them inaccessible to the binding site of the CD-MPR. Since the same enzymes bind to the CI-MPR at neutral pH, at least a portion of the phosphomannosyl residues must be exposed. It appeared that small variations in the pH of the Golgi compartment where lysosomal enzymes bind to the receptors could potentially modulate the extent of binding to the two receptors (Hoflack et al. 1987).",

The transport of proteins from the secretory to the endocytic pathway is mediated by carrier vesicles coated with the AP-1 Golgi assembly proteins and clathrin. The MPRs are segregated into these transport vesicles. Together with GTPase-ARF-1, these cargo proteins are essential components for the efficient translocation of cytosolic AP-1 onto membranes of the TGN, the first step of clathrin coat assembly. The transport of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes requires two distinct determinants in the CD-MPR carboxyl-terminal domain, a casein kinase II phosphorylation site critical for the efficient interaction of AP-1 with its target membranes and the adjacent di-leucine motif which appears more important for a post AP-1 binding step in the CD-MPR cycling pathway.",

The return pathway from the early endosomal compartment to the Golgi is probably mediated by PACS-1-assisted packaging into AP1-containing CCVs, whereas that from the late endosomal (LE) compartments is mediated by TIP47 and Rab9. Some of the MPRs go to the cell surface either from early or late endosomes through the recycling endosome (RE), or from proximal TGN cisternae as a consequence of mis-sorting.

The identification of a TGN exit signal in its cytoplasmic tail elucidates the trafficking pathway of uncovering enzyme, a crucial player in the process of lysosomal biogenesis (Nair et al. 2005).

The mammalian AP-3 adaptor-like complex mediates the intracellular transport of lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (Le Borgne et al. 1998b). Electron microscopy showed that AP-3 is associated with budding profiles evolving from a tubular endosomal compartment that also exhibits budding profiles positive for AP-1. AP-3 colocalizes with clathrin, but to a lesser extent than does AP-1. The AP-3- and AP-1-bearing tubular compartments contain low amounts of the CI-MPR and the lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs) 1 and 2. AP-3 defines a novel pathway by which lysosomal membrane proteins are transported from tubular sorting endosomes to lysosomes. In an attempt to find the site of action of AP-3 Chapuy et al. (2008) showed that sorting of TRP-1 and CD-MPR was AP-1 dependent, while budding of tyrosinase and LAMP-1 required AP-3. Depletion of clathrin inhibited sorting of all four cargo proteins, suggesting that AP-1 and AP-3 are involved in the formation of distinct types of CCVs, each of which is characterized by the incorporation of specific cargo membrane proteins. Harasaki et al. (2005) indicated that three proteins: CI-MPR, carboxypeptidase D (CPD) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) have AP-dependent sorting signals, which may help to explain the relative abundance of AP complexes in CCVs.",

(1993) indicated that CD-MPR is required for efficient intracellular targeting of multiple lysosomal enzymes, although homozygous mice lacking CD-MPR suggested that other targeting mechanisms could partially compensate for the loss of CD-MPR in vivo. The cytoplasmic domain of the M6P/IGF2R has two signals for lysosomal enzyme sorting in the Golgi, a di-leucine-based motif (LLHV sequence) and the tyrosine-based endocytosis motif (YKYSKV sequence) (Johnson and Kornfeld 1992), whereas a di-leucine-based motif near the carboxyl terminus of the CD-MPR (HLLPM sequence) in cytoplasmic domain is essential for efficient targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes (Johnson and Kornfeld 1992). Several other transmembrane proteins destined to the lysosomes also contain di-leucine-based motifs in their cytoplasmic domains that are essential for their proper delivery to lysosomes (Sandoval and Bakke 1994). In the light of these different results, it has been proposed that di-leucine-based motifs mediate sorting of membrane proteins in the TGN. In both MPRs, the di-leucine motifs are flanked by casein kinase II phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated in vivo (M\u00e9resse et al. 1990; Hemer et al. 1993). Such a post-translational modification occurs when the M6P/IGF2R exits from the TGN and represents a major, albeit transient, modification (M\u00e9resse and Hoflack 1993). Thus far, the functional importance of the phosphorylation sites in the M6P/IGF2R trafficking has remained controversial (Johnson and Kornfeld 1992; Chen et al. 1993). Mouse L cells deficient in the M6P/IGF-IIR were transfected with normal bovine CD-MPR cDNA or cDNAs containing mutations in the 67-amino acid cytoplasmic tail and assayed for their ability to target the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D to lysosomes. Mutant receptors with the carboxyl-terminal His-Leu-Leu-Pro-Met67 residues deleted or replaced with alanines sorted cathepsin D below the base-line value (Johnson and Kornfeld 1992). Of the eight amino acids mutated in bovine CD-MPR, four (Gln66, Arg111, Glu133, and Tyr143) were found to be essential for ligand binding. In addition, mutation of the single histidine residue, His105, within the binding site diminished the binding of the receptor to ligand, but did not eliminate the ability of the CD-MPR to release ligand under acidic conditions (Olson et al. 1999a).",

MPR-negative fibroblasts have a low capacity of recruiting AP-1 which can be restored by re-expressing the MPRs in these cells.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses of constructs containing single amino acid substitutions showed that these conserved residues (Gln644, Arg687, Glu709, Tyr714) are critical for carbohydrate recognition by domain 5. Furthermore, the N-glycosylation site at position 711 of domain 5, which is predicted to be located near the binding pocket, has no influence on the carbohydrate binding affinity. Using endogenous ligands for the MPRs demonstrated that, unlike the CD-MPR or domain 9 of the CI-MPR, domain 5 exhibits a 14\u201318-fold higher affinity for MP-GlcNAc than M6P, implicating this region of the receptor in targeting phosphodiester-containing lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome (Chavez et al. 2007). Crystallographic studies have shown that at pH 6.5, the CD-MPR bound to M6P adopts a significantly different quaternary conformation than the CD-MPR in a ligand-unbound state, a feature unique among known lectin structures. Additional crystal structures of the available CD-MPR revealed the positional invariability of specific binding pocket residues which implicate intermonomer contact(s), as well as the protonation state of M6P, as regulators of pH-dependent carbohydrate binding (Olson et al. 2008).",

Because a diaromatic amino acid sequence is also present in the cytoplasmic tail of other receptors known to be internalized from the plasma membrane, this feature may be a general determinant for endosomal sorting (Schweizer et al. 1997). However, the CI-MPR lacks such a di-aromatic motif. Studies indicate that sorting of the CD-MPR in late endosomes requires a distinct di-aromatic motif with only limited possibilities for variations, in contrast to the CI-MPR, which seems to require a putative loop (Pro49-Pro-Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly55) along with additional hydrophobic residues in the cytoplasmic tail. This raises the possibility of two separate binding sites on Tip47 because both receptors require binding to Tip47 for endosomal sorting (Nair et al. 2003).",

            "text": "Evasion of lysosomal degradation of the CD-MPR requires reversible palmitoylation of a cysteine residue in its cytoplasmic tail. Because palmitoylation is reversible and essential for correct trafficking, it presents a potential regulatory mechanism for the sorting signals within the cytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR. The two cysteine residues (Cys30 and Cys34) in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD-MPR are palmitoylated via thioesters and Cys34 residue influences the biologic function of the receptor. Mutation of Cys34 to Ala resulted in the gradual accumulation of the receptor in dense lysosomes and the total loss of cathepsin D sorting function in the Golgi. A Cys30 to Ala mutation had no biologic consequences, showing the importance of Cys34. Mutation of amino acids 35\u201339 to alanines impaired palmitoylation of Cys30 and Cys34 and resulted in abnormal receptor trafficking to lysosomes and loss of cathepsin D sorting. The palmitoylation of Cys30 and Cys34 leads to anchoring of this region of the cytoplasmic tail to the lipid bilayer. Thus, anchoring via Cys34 is essential for the normal trafficking and lysosomal enzyme sorting function of the receptor (Schweizer et al. 1996). The palmitoylation of the CD-MPR occurs enzymatically by a membrane-bound palmitoyltransferase, which cycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane. The localization of the palmitoyltransferase indicates it as a regulator of the intracellular trafficking of the CD-MPR and also affects the sorting/activity of other receptors cycling through endosomes (St\u00f6ckli and Rohrer 2004).",
