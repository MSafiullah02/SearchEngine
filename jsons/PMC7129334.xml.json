While most confirmed MERS-CoV cases originate in the Arabian Peninsula, several MERS-CoV infections have been imported to Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, all with direct or indirect connection with the Middle East [4]. These imported cases highlight the fact that MERS-CoV, like other airborne viruses such as influenza, has the capability for worldwide spread. Clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to very severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multi-organ failure resulting in death [3], [4], [5].",

Knowledge and application of basic hygiene principles and measures in such an environment is therefore vitally important. However, pilgrims may not be aware of MERS-CoV and the protective measures that should be followed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases during the Hajj as had been reported in previous studies [8], [9]. As pilgrims' awareness is highly important to control the disease, this study aimed to evaluate pilgrims' knowledge, attitude and practices regarding MERS-CoV during the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.",

The ritual performed on these days is called the Stoning of the Devil and it takes place at Jamaraat, Mina. During this ritual, pilgrims throw seven tiny pebbles at each of three white pillars and then they go back to their place of residence in Mina, where they had plenty of time to fill out the questionnaire.",

The survey consists of four sections with a total of 35 questions.(1)Section one: This section is comprised of eight items; it is mainly focused on participants' characteristics including age, gender, nationality, etc.(2)Section two: The main aim of this section is to evaluate the Hajj pilgrims' general knowledge about coronavirus. Dichotomized \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d and \u201cdon't know\u201d options were used for the purpose of evaluation using nine items. To make a clear demarcation of participants' knowledge level, the responses were scored. Every correct answer added one mark to a participant's total score, and zero was given for wrong or uncertain answers. The minimum possible score for each section (knowledge, attitude and practices) is zero, while the maximum is nine. To discern the knowledge differences among the groups, the knowledge score was further divided into three categories: a cut-off value of \u22658 was taken as good knowledge, while between 5 and 7 was considered moderate and a score of \u22644 was considered as a poor knowledge score.(3)Section three: This section evaluated participant attitudes and beliefs about coronavirus. Nine items were provided for the participants to disclose their beliefs using a three-item Likert-type scale (agree, disagree, uncertain). Every appropriate attitude added one mark to a participant's total score, and zero was given for inappropriate attitude. A cut-off value of \u22658 was taken as good attitude, while between 5 and 7 was considered moderate and a score of \u22644 was considered as a poor attitude score.(4)Section four: This section is comprised of nine items that assess practices and behaviours of pilgrims regarding coronavirus using dichotomized \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d options. Every appropriate behaviour added one mark to a participant's total score, and zero was given for inappropriate behaviour. A cut-off value of \u22658 was taken as good practice while between 5 and 7 was considered moderate and a score of \u22644 was considered as a poor practice score.\n",

In terms of knowledge regarding the incubation period of coronavirus, most participants (55%, 142/257) did not know that the incubation period or the period between exposure to coronavirus infection and the appearance of the first symptoms is from two to 14 days, and fewer than half of the participants (45%, 115/257) did not know that people with comorbidity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other chronic diseases) are more likely to be infected with coronavirus. Meanwhile, fewer than half of Hajj pilgrims were not aware that there is no vaccine available in the market to protect against coronavirus (42%, 109/257). Ninety-seven (38%) participants incorrectly believed that the main source of coronavirus is a plant.",
