This is in agreement with Schnagl et al. 11978, 19791 , who detected CVLPs in the stools of Australian aboriginal children with similar frequency whether healthy or with acute diarrhea. Moreover, Sitbon 119851 found a higher proportion of healthy children in Gabon shedding CVLPs (65.2% ) than children with diarrhea (38.5%). Thus it is unlikely that CVLPs shed by children in developing populations are a major cause of diarrhea. Nevertheless, causation of diarrhea cannot be ruled out, as prolonged infection could occur, starting with diarrhea and resulting in reduced pathogenicity and hence tolerance. Assuming that CVLPs are enteric viruses, spread could be by the fecal-oral andlor respiratory route. If the spread is fecal-oral, then transmission is most likely to be related to conditions of hygiene rather than to the quality of drinking water, because no association between CVLP shedding and quality of water was found [Esrey et al., 19871. Twenty-five 5% of children shed a t least one bacterial pathogen in this study, which is a further indication that hygiene standards were low. However, CVLP shedding was apparently unrelated to the amount of water used per household, the presence of a latrine, or characteristics of the mother that might be related to hygiene.

It is not known what these factors might be. Poor hygiene and malnourishment may play a role. It is also possible that susceptible children such as those found in our study are effectively immunocompromised as a result of repeated exposure to pathogens. The figures reported by other authors, revealing high rates of shedding in some third world populations [Mathan et al., 1975; Sitbon, 1985; Schnagl et al., 1978, 19791 may also reflect exposure to multiple pathogens.

Although we could not demonstrate prolonged shedding, chronic infection with seasonal shedding cannot be discounted. It seems more likely that the progressive decrease in the proportion of children shedding CVLPs over the 5-week study period was due to seasonal shedding.
