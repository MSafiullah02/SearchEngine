He was examined by JJYS. His fever had gone by March 12, and his chest radiograph was normal. His platelet count was 94\u00d7109/L and white-cell count was 3\u00b74\u00d7109/L (monocytes 0\u00b74\u00d7109/L). A nasopharyngeal swab grew no pathogens. He was admitted to the SARS triage ward on March 13, and was started on oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day and levofloxacin 500 mg daily. Further blood tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (platelets 61\u00d7109/L, D-dimer 630 ng/mL, prothrombin time 11\u00b71s, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 43\u00b73s). His white-cell count was 1\u00b78\u00d7109/L (neutrophils 1\u00d71\u00d7109/L, lymphocytes 0\u00b75\u00d7109/L, and monocytes 0\u00b72\u00d7109/L. His chest radiograph showed a prominent right hilum. CT of his thorax showed an ill-defined opacity with an air bronchogram in the apical posterior segment of the right lower lobe and diffusely in the right middle lobe. He was started on oral ribavirin 1\u00b72 g thrice daily and intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily. His fever settled the next morning and his coagulopathy improved (APTT 40\u00b77 s, platelet count 105\u00d7109/L, and D-dimer of 564 ng/mL). On March 19, 2003, oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg was started.",

A secondary bacterial chest infection was suspected, and cefipime 2 g was given intravenously. Over the next 2 days he became increasingly breathless and his coagulopathy became worse (D-dimer 716 ng/mL, prothrombin time 11\u00b79 s, platelets 199\u00d7109/L). The patient was given a single dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously and 4 L/min of oxygen. After this, he began to get better. Coagulation parameters returned to normal, he was weaned off of oxygen, and was discharged from hospital on March 31, 2003, on 0\u00b73 mg/kg prednisolone and ribavirin 600 mg orally three times a day. On April 7, his chest radiograph showed worsening consolidation of the consolidation of the right middle zone and the prednisolone was increased to 0\u00b75 mg/kg.",

There is often a break in the fever between the viraemic stage (days 1\u20133) and the lung inflammation phase of the illness. Patients who become apyrexial for several days still need up to 10 days of quarantine and follow-up. Haemorrhagic-fever-like illness with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy does occur but is usually mild. Although 78\u00b73% of SARS patients in our centre had an abnormal chest radiographs when feverish,3 some can have relatively normal radiographs. As shown in this case, a chest CT can show hidden pneumonic changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis.",
