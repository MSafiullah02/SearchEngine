Each data point represents one mouse. (h) Large areas of AEC2 depletion are present in both wild-type and HIF1\u03b1 -/lungs, quantified in (i). SPC staining in airways (h, right) is an artifact of the goat anti-pro-SPC antibody. (i) Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n=4 wild-type, n=3 HIF1\u03b1 -/mice from 2 independent experiments. (j) HIF1\u03b1 -/mice recover weight more rapidly than their wild-type counterparts after influenza injury. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n=10 wild-type, n=10 HIF1\u03b1 -/-, n=8 uninfected wild-type mice from three independent experiments. (k) Significant difference in average arterial oxygen saturation at 13 days postinfection between HIF1\u03b1 -/and wild-type mice. Each data point represents the average % O2 saturation reading for a single mouse at this time point (see Fig. 1h ). Data are mean \u00b1 SEM, n= 7 HIF1\u03b1 -/-, n = 14 wild-type (2 Shh-Cre neg , 12 C57BL6) mice from two independent experiments. Analysis is 11 days post-infection unless otherwise indicated. p values derived by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, except in (k) derived by Mann Whitney. ",
