Here, we use population size for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and forecasting of the epidemic. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and using nonlinear filtering theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. The model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter. Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its selection criterion. We estimate the mean of the basic reproductive number of China and the rest of the globe except China (GEC) to be 2.46 (95% CI: 2.41-2.51) and 3.64 (95% CI: (3.55-3.72), respectively. We infer that the number of latent infections of GEC is about 7.47 \u00d7 10 5 (95% CI: 7.32 \u00d7 10 5 -7.62 \u00d7 10 5 ) as of April 2, 2020. We predict that the peak of infections in hospitals of GEC may reach 3.00 \u00d7 10 6 on the present trajectory, i.e., if the population size for pathogen transmission and epidemic parameters remains unchanged. If the control intensity is strengthened, e.g., 50% reduction or 75% reduction of the population size for pathogen transmission, the peak would decline to 1.84 \u00d7 10 6 , 1.27 \u00d7 10 6 , respectively.",

Faced with the severe epidemic trend of COVID-19, many countries have declared a state of emergency and have instituted drastic actions and interventions to stop the spread of the virus. For example, China implemented unprecedented intervention strategies on January 23, 2020 to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19. These policies have included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases which have made a huge difference in controlling the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, the outbreak is still continuing and having a devastating impact in Europe, USA and many other countries. Many scientific research groups in the world including those in China, Europe, and the United States are working independently or together by sharing their results and experiences, including analyzing the mechanism of disease transmission [2] [3] [4] and identifying optimal control measures [5] [6] [7] for countries where the outbreak is in its early stages. In addition, the prevention and control experience of the 2003 SARS epidemic [8] [9] [10] , the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [11] , and the 2012 MERS-CoV [12] are also being used for COVID-19.",

The classical SIR, SEIR and GLEAM models are extensively used [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] for comprehending the mechanism of disease transmission, its spread and forecasting. These approaches have become remarkably successful in free infection and transmission patterns and predicting the temporal evolution of ongoing epidemics. However, under strict control measures, the abundance of different, often mutually incompatible, forecasting results, suggest that we still lack a fundamental understanding of the key factors of infection and transmission dynamics. One of the them is the population size under consideration for pathogen transmission. Here, we assume that there exists a closed subsystem in a city or country when the uninfected people are in home quarantine or some cities are locked down. The population size of the subsystem is considered as the population size for pathogen transmission, which is usually much smaller than the total population of a city or county when deploying intervention strategies. The total population is divided into the population for pathogen transmission and the isolated uninfected population (see Fig. 1 ). Figure 1 : The total population and its division.",

Fig. 2(b) shows the prediction for Beijing City. It indicates that when N is greater than 10 5 , the predicted values are the same, i.e, N is unidentifiable. This is consistent with Propositions 1-2. In fact, early on in the epidemic, Beijing took very strict control measures so that the basic reproductive number is very small, the small number of infections cannot spread to a larger population. Therefore, for global prediction, it is required to select the population size carefully. Through the selection criterion (18) and setting J = 7, we select the population size based on the prevalence data of COVID-19 epidemic [28] , [29] from the date of the first confirmed infection to April 2, 2020. Table 1 gives the selected values of N and national populations [30] of several major epidemic affected countries and GEC. Here, we restate that N is the population size for pathogen transmission. The total national population is divided into the population for pathogen transmission and the isolated uninfected population. It shows that the selected N under public health interventions are far less than the national population. Comparing Iran with Italy, they have a similar total population, however, Iran has a smaller size N for pathogen transmission, i.e, stronger control measures [31] . Moreover, to validate the selected population sizes N , Fig. 3 shows the reported confirmed infections from the date of the first confirmed case to April 2, 2020, daily prediction of one time step and the corresponding 95% CIs for several major epidemic affected countries and GEC, respectively. It indicates that the 95% CIs can cover the true confirmed infections, no matter what in the outbreak phase (see Fig. 3(a) , 3(c)-3(l)), or end of the outbreak (see Fig. 3(b) ).",

Besides, Fig. 3(l) indicates the epidemic trend of COVID-19 globally is still in the outbreak with exponential growth. Furthermore, more prediction results of 1-7 days are updated and available on https://github.com/SCU-Bigdata/2019-nCoV-Forecast in time since February 7, 2020. 4(a) shows the estimation of the basic reproductive number R 0 of China from January 21, 2020 to March 18, 2020 when there were no local newly confirmed cases [28] . It shows that the basic reproductive number increases monotonically early on in the outbreak, then monotonically decreases with a sharp infection point. This is consistent with the policy decision in which Chinese government implemented unprecedented public health interventions to prevent the spread of the epidemic and the incubation period is about 7-14 days [4] . The reason for monotonic increase in the early stages of the epidemic may be that, in a limited local city, the density of infections increases as a result of the infections increasing exponentially. It results in a quick growth of the contact rate \u03b1(t). The recovery rate is very low due to the recovery cycle. The reason for monotonic decrease is that the public health interventions (e.g. scales of quarantine, strict controls on travel, hand hygiene, and use of face masks etc. [32] ) significantly decrease the contact rate \u03b1(t) and the recovery rate gradually increases, which results in a monotonic decrease of R 0 . In Fig. 4(b) , although the basic reproductive number of GEC has passed the infection point, which is consistent with the policy decision in which European countries and USA have implemented strict public health interventions, the current R 0 is still high and fluctuates around 3.64. We also present the estimated mean values and 95% CI of the key epidemiological parameters of GEC and China in Table 2 . The mean of the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 in China is 2.46 (95% CI: 2.41-2.51). This finding aligns with other recent estimates of the basic reproductive number for this time period [5, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . ",

In this study, we developed a stochastic SEIR model under public health interventions, the nonlinear filtering and prediction methods and selection criterion for the population size for pathogen transmission, which could be valuable to national and international agencies for public health situation perception and design of intervention strategies. Our technical contributions are made with a the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that has engulfed the world. We infer that USA has the most serious situation as it has 1.90 \u00d7 10 5 (95% CI: 1.87 \u00d7 10 5 -1.92 \u00d7 10 5 ) latent infections as of April 2, 2020. And in England, the latent infections account for a very large fraction as high as 58% of the total number of infections, which would maintain outbreaks with a lag time about 1-2 weeks. And then, similar phenomenon will occur in Austria, Japan and Netherlands. The global latent infections of GEC is about 7.47 \u00d7 10 5 (95% CI: 7.32 \u00d7 10 5 -7.62 \u00d7 10 5 ) as of April 2, 2020.

Here we regard the population size N for pathogen transmission as one of the measures of the control intensity, which is conducive to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions. Moreover, it is valuable to obtain the more accurate number of the latent infections, which is helpful to design control strategies (e.g., scales of quarantine, strict controls on travel, contact isolation, hand hygiene, and use of face masks) in the future. However, on the population size N , we selected it by minimizing the prediction error based only on the current data, which may be prone to overfitting of the data. One possible improvement approach is to include the prediction covariance in the selection criterion. Besides, the stochastic model (8)- (13) ignored the impact of the imported cases, which are considered as random noises. If the airline transportation data can be obtained, by combining the networked dynamic metapopulation model (e.g., [14, 18, 40] ) and selection of the local population sizes in time, more accurate prediction methods and results for the local and global trend may be obtained. We believe that it is extremely important to predict further spread of COVID-19 globally and evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies and to try to mitigate the impact of this pandemic on the entire global population.",

We find that except Korea, by decreasing of the population size, i.e., strict control measures, the peaks would have a decrease, especially in Austria, England, France, Germany, Iran, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and USA, and the time of peaks would arrive earlier. It is worth noting that this is different from the results in [5]. The reason is that the authors in [5] assume that the population size is fixed and strengthen the control intensity by reducing the contact rate \u03b1(t). Thus, it is not contradictory. In Korea, there are no effects of different population sizes. The reason is that Korea is near the end of the epidemic. There are very small number of the latent infections. The prediction of states are same for different N when they are large enough. This is consistent with Propositions 1-2.",
