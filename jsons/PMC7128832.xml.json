In 1346 the Tatars laid siege to the Black Sea city of Kaffa. When their soldiers began to die of plague, they catapulted the victims' bodies over the walls and into the besieged city. Kaffa's survivors fled by ship to Genoa and Venice. The infected refugees are believed to have initiated the \u201cBlack Death\u201d plague epidemic that killed one-third of Europe's population during the 14th and 15th centuries (9).",

Long-term mental health complications may result from the acute psychological stress during the event, or from the intoxication itself (23). After the Tokyo sarin attack, these complications were reported to be significant. Other examples of adverse effects, related to the specific chemical agent, include neurological damage after nerve agent exposure, and chronic pulmonary damage after phosgene exposure. Follow-up clinics should be established as soon as possible after the incident to optimize long-term surveillance and treatment (16).",

A non-conventional attack on an unprepared civilian population could become a major catastrophe. It has the potential to defeat all civilian order, health and managing systems bringing chaos and demoralization to the community. It is essential that prompt emergency plans be instituted to cope with this kind of terrorism. Preparedness programs at all medical levels should include staff education as well as acquisition of protective, treatment, and decontamination capabilities. Furthermore, integration and cooperation of all relevant organizations is crucial in case of such an attack (24).",
