            "text": "Background: Minimally-invasive approaches to aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) are technically and logistically demanding. However, few centers have started using these approaches with standard equipment because of the limited resources. We sought to report intra-and postoperative clinical outcomes and address health resource utilization after MIAVR. Results: A total of 102 eligible patients who had aortic valve replacement were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted from June 2015 to December 2017. Fifty patients underwent aortic valve surgery via upper inverted T-shaped hemi-sternotomy (MS), and 52 patients were operated using full sternotomy (FS) in two centers in a developing country. Central cannulation was performed in all cases. Major adverse cardiac events, pain, and wound complications were compared. A cost analysis was performed, and exposure and feasibility for cannulation were assessed. The mean length of MS skin incision was 5.82 \u00b1 0.67 cm. Cumulative cross-clamp time was insignificant between both groups (91.87 \u00b1 34.41 versus 94.91 \u00b1 33.96 min; p = 0.66). MS exhibited shorter ventilation time (6.18 \u00b1 1.86 versus 10.68 \u00b1 12.78 h; p = 0.029) and intensive care stays (33.27 \u00b1 19.75 versus 49.42 \u00b1 47.1 h; p = 0.037). Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were compared, and MS group exhibited fewer transfusions (1.18 \u00b1 0.89 versus 1.7 \u00b1 0.97 units; p = 0.002), fewer pulmonary complications (1 (2%) versus 2 (3.8%); p < 0.001), and less sternotomy wound infection (1 (2%) versus 5 (9.6%); p = 0.048). Total operative mortality of 4.46% was recorded (n = 5). Significant cost reduction was recorded favoring MS; central cannulation saved $907.16 and carried a total cost reduction of $580 (9.3%) when compared with the FS approach (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: With a lack of logistics in developing countries, MIAVR not only has a cosmetic advantage but carries a significant reduction in blood use, respiratory complications, pain, and cost. MIAVR can be feasible, with a rapid learning curve in developing centers.",

The sample size was small, and the calculation was based on a single outcome of the ICU stay. Other vital outcomes were mentioned as secondary outcomes. Despite the orientation of all surgical teams with both approaches, several surgeons still preferred a traditional FS, so there might have been some selection bias as allocation was according to surgeons' preference. The unequal number of groups was another issue. However, the groups were almost matched demographically. Despite the FS group had of higher BMI, we included cases with morbid obesity in the mini-sternotomy group up to 158 kg/BMI 60.2 kg/m 2 without impact on postoperative outcomes. The study might be underpowered to detect significance in the difference in low-frequency events. This may or may not have affected some of the important outcomes such as pulmonary or neurological complications but not the ICU stay. Although we incorporated fast recovery protocols in our ICU, the duration of endotracheal intubation and length of postoperative stay was decided by the individual surgeon. No conversions were recorded. Aortic surgery via mini-sternotomy has already been done in many centers worldwide, this study introduced MS at our centers with limited resources and achieved excellent outcomes with some benefits.",
