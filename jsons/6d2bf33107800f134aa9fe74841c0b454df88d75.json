Vaccination, whenever available, is the best way to prevent the spreading, because it eventually immunizes individuals. However, vaccines are not perfect, and total immunization is not guaranteed. Imperfect immunization has driven the emergence of antivaccine movements that totally alter the predictions about the epidemic incidence. Here, we propose a mathematically solvable mean-field vaccination model to mimic the spontaneous adoption of vaccines against influenzalike diseases and the expected epidemic incidence. The results are in agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the epidemics and vaccination coevolutionary processes. Interestingly, the results reveal a nonmonotonic behavior on the vaccination coverage that increases with the imperfection of the vaccine and after decreases. This apparent counterintuitive behavior is analyzed and understood from stability principles of the proposed mathematical model.",

Specifically, this approach has shed light on many conundrums by considering the networked structure of contacts, their timevarying and multilayer character, as well as the recurrent nature of mobility patterns [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Vaccination, whenever possible, is the most effective way to harness and prevent the spreading of a disease [9] . Under normal circumstances, the decision of getting vaccinated can be considered as an act of cooperation, since it bestows benefits on the whole population at the expenses of single individuals. Notwithstanding, we are recently witnessing the emergence of widespread antivaccine movements, which are mainly fueled by misconceptions and mischievous news about vaccines [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Scientists (including physicists) are devoting tremendous efforts in designing efficient immunization strategies [17] as well as shedding light on the mechanisms behind the deliberate decision of not getting vaccinated and their harmful consequences [18, 19] .",

Under such premises, the evolution of vaccines' voluntary adoption can be investigated using the machinery of game theory [20, 21] and statistical physics [22, 23] . The first studies carried out on vaccination games use classical game theory, with single round games in which agents have perfect knowledge of their odds to get infected [24, 25] . In reality, however, individuals are not perfectly aware of the risk to get infected, and vaccination coverage may evolve in time as a byproduct of personal experiences or imitation. Therefore, evolutionary game theory is the natural workbench to tackle the problem. The seminal works in this direction assumed the simultaneous evolution of vaccination and spreading dynamics [26] [27] [28] . A different approach was used in the case of seasonal influenza, by considering that the spreading process reaches its stationary state before vaccination games take place [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

This, in turns, allows us to estimate the risk of future outbreaks by encapsulating agents' strategies into an epidemic model. We get analytical results and insightful conclusions from the analysis of this framework in well-mixed populations. More specifically, we unveil how the interplay between the probability of infection, vaccine effectiveness, and cost, gives rise to nonlinear responses in vaccine uptake. Our analysis reveals a nonmonotonic behavior on the vaccination coverage which, surprisingly, increases as the vaccine quality deteriorates.

We assume that this population has initially undergone a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) disease spreading [2, 3] . To stay simple and keep the problem still analytically solvable, we set the disease incidence in such previous season equal to \u03b1. Such quantity is an input parameter of the model and acts as a proxy for the perception of infection risk, e.g., advised through the mass-media. After the first outbreak, the vaccination dynamics takes place. As a result, agents converge to the decision of vaccinating (V) or not (NV). The resulting strategy is the outcome of the evolutionary dynamics (see below) given the previous incidence, \u03b1, infection probability, \u03b2, recovery cost, T , the cost of the vaccine, c, and its failure rate, \u03b3 , or equivalently, its effectiveness (1 \u2212 \u03b3 ). The corresponding vaccine coverage-given by the fraction of vaccinated agents y eq -is used as the input of a new SIR spreading process, having the same \u03b2 and T . The results of the SIR dynamics allow us to estimate the total infection incidence, R \u221e , as a function of the relevant parameters, especially \u03b1. The mathematical definition of \u03b1 is the probability of infection, in the previous outbreak, of an agent without protection against the disease.",

As effectiveness decreases, the risk for a not vaccinated agent of getting infected by a previously vaccinated one becomes y eff \u00d7 \u03b2\u03b1\u03b3 . Conversely, the risk of a vaccinated agent to get infected by a nonvaccinated becomes (1 \u2212 y eff ) \u00d7 \u03b2\u03b1\u03b3 . Comparing these two risks, the vaccinated agent has an advantage over the nonvaccinated if y eff > (1 \u2212 y eff ), which translates into y eff > 0.5. Hence, the counterintuitive act of vaccinating when the efficiency of the vaccine is low turns out to be a rational decision to mitigate the infection pressure. Moreover, the existence-for each infectivity \u03b2-of a maximum fraction of vaccinated agents, y * max , delimitates a region of \"tolerable effectiveness\" beyond which agents decide to non vaccinate. Also, the position of y * max versus \u03b2 splits the phase space into two distinct regions (Fig. 2 inset) . Interestingly, this effect has been observed previously in other coevolutionary models [31] [32] [33] , but never explained hitherto. At variance with y, the fraction of effectively vaccinated agents, y eff , is always lowered by a decrease of the vaccine quality, i.e., d[(1\u2212\u03b3 )y * ] d\u03b3 < 0. Therefore, the higher vaccination coverage is not counterbalancing the lower vaccine quality. Let us analyze this dependency more in detail.",

As expected, a remarkably high fraction of recovered agents is observed for a highly infective epidemic (large \u03b2) paired with a small fraction of infected agents in the previous outbreak (small \u03b1). In Fig. 3(b) , one can observe that, given a value of \u03b1, the fraction of recovered individuals is maximal at the vaccination threshold\u03b2. A way of finding the maxima and minima of the fraction of recovered agents, R \u221e , is considering its derivative with respect to the tranmission probability, \u03b2, d R \u221e d\u03b2 . Note that in an infinite system, the transcendental equation Eq. (12) takes three different forms depending on the vaccination coverage:",

In these regimes the vaccination coverage does not vary with \u03b2 (y eq = 0 and y eq = 1, respectively), wherefore R \u221e increases monotonously with \u03b2. In the intermediate regime\u03b2 < \u03b2 < \u03b2/\u03b3 , though, where y eq = y * , R \u221e monotonously decreases with \u03b2 ( dR \u221e d\u03b2 < 0). Consequently, vaccination emerges in a way such that it outweighs the increased transmission probability and hinders the epidemic spreading, as illustrated in Fig. 3(c) . From these considerations, we can conclude that the fraction of recovered agents is locally maximal at \u03b2 =\u03b2, and locally minimal at \u03b2 =\u03b2/\u03b3 . The numerical exploration of the parameter space has confirmed hitherto that the former is also a global maximum. Moreover, the highest fraction of recovered, R max \u221e , for a fully vaccinated population (y eq = 1) would correspond to meaningless values of the parameters. Depending on the parameters, the system will not be in all of the three regimes presented in Eq. (18) as the transmission probability, \u03b2, is varied. If the parameters are such that\u03b2/\u03b3 > 1, the system will never fall in the third regime. Consequently, R \u221e monotonously decreases once vaccination emerges. Similarly, one might have\u03b2 > 1 for which the system shows no vaccination and R \u221e monotonously increases with \u03b2. The different cases are illustrated in Fig. 3(c) .",

Albeit appearing irrational and counterintuitive at first sight, such behavior is-instead-due to the interplay between the vaccination game and the disease spreading processes. The model predicts also that highly infective-but under control-epidemics might prove dangerous for future infections, since they alter the \"risk perception\" of the agents and induce them to nonvaccination. Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, the timescale between the two dynamics (decision and spreading) has always been considered fixed. The sole exception, up to our knowledge, are childhood diseases with long term immunity [27, 34] . The framework presented here could be used to fill the gap among different model formulations and unify them.",
