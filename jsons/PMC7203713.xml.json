According to the guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial Version 7th) China [1], confirmed COVID-19 cases need to be referred to a designated hospital while suspected cases need to be quarantined under medical surveillance. The medical care for quarantined patients and isolation for people with whom they have had close contact requires larger public health surveillance and response systems with an enormous medical burden. Chest CT can yield a quick positive result prior to positive real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is the gold standard for confirming COVID-19 at present [2] but with a notable false negative rate [3\u20135]. Although typical and atypical CT image findings are reported in several papers [2, 6\u201315], overlapping CT image features with viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases also make an exclusion diagnosis difficult. We attempted to develop a simple and practical method to stratify cases requiring different repetition times of RT-PCR to identify highly suspicious cases and highly excluded cases.",

All CT findings were described according to the Fleischner Society recommendations and similar studies [19\u201321]. Peripheral distribution was defined as any lesion affecting a peripheral area (3\u20134 cm in thickness at the lung periphery) with or without central distribution. Central distribution was defined as ONLY central distribution (the central tubular structures in a secondary pulmonary lobule), and any lesion with a peripheral area affected was excluded. Ground glass opacification was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure the underlying bronchial and vascular margins; consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of bronchial structures and pulmonary vessels [19](Fig. 1a, b). A crazy-paving pattern is ground-glass opacity superimposed with lines of reticular patterns [22](Fig. 1c). Rounded GGO is a round-shaped GGO in any plane (Fig. 1a). The subpleural bandlike GGO is a pronounced peripheral, subpleural distribution along with axial pleura (Fig. 1d). Central (peribronchovascular) distribution was defined as typically around the bronchiolar vascular bundle and sparing the subpleural surfaces. They are typically at least 5\u201310 mm away from the pleural surfaces [23] (Fig. 1e). The tree-in-bud sign was defined as peripheral, small, centrilobular, and well-defined nodules of soft-tissue attenuation connecting to linear, branching opacities that have more than one contiguous branching site [24] (Fig. 1f).",

Chest CT examination plays a vital role in the initial and early diagnosis of COVID-19 [8]. Positive chest CT can be obtained before the initial positive RT-PCR. Given the varied isolation and treatment principles of suspected COVID-19 with epidemic history, it is important to focus on baseline CT findings that radiologists first encounter to differentiate non-COVID-19 from COVID-19 in the patients\u2019 first consultation at a general hospital. Although Bai et al. [25] revealed that radiologists were capable of distinguishing COVID-19 from viral pneumonia upon chest CT with high specificity and moderate and varying specificity (24\u201394%) among 7 different readers from China and the USA, an easily understood and simple method is still urgently needed in epidemic areas, especially areas lacking medical resources and well-trained radiologists. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients are more likely to present with some CT image features according to previous studies. We have summarized the 7 most common imaging features in COVID-19 patients as a positive score point. All of the positive score points assessed in our study were significantly different between the two groups, except for GGO with or without consolidation. GGO can result from the pathology of alveolar damage filling with blood, pus, water or cells [9, 26] in viral infections, including COVID-19, and bacterial infections. GGO with or without consolidation is to some extent related to the different course of the disease. However, consolidation would be increased in the progressive stage (5\u20138 days) [10]. To reduce interference by consolidation, our study confined the cohort to within 7 days after onset of symptoms. The small COVID-19 virus, 60\u2013140 nm in diameter [1], could go straight to the terminal alveoli, reasonably favouring peripheral distribution while other, much larger pathogens would not pass through the alveolar pores easily. The \u2018crazy-paving\u2019 pattern results from thickening of the interlobular septa, and it can be seen primarily in any airspace, interstitial, or mixed disease [27]. Rounded GGO as well as subpleural bandlike GGO are very conspicuous and characteristic signs at the first glance on examination of the COVID-19 CT images. Although there was no explanation for these two signs, they could be easily detected; we used them as our positive scoring points.",

Based on the fact that most of the reported COVID-19 cases affected more than 2 lobes of the lungs, only one lobe involvement was taken as a negative scoring point. Meanwhile, single-lobe infection has been reported in some cases of community-acquired pneumonia [28]. Some progressive COVID-19 cases may affect the central area from the peripheral lung [15]. An image showing only central (peribronchovascular) distribution indicates distal small airway wall destruction or peribronchovacular infection, which is similar to the reason for the tree-in-bud pattern. The pathogenesis of bronchial wall thickening can be inflammatory damage of the bronchial wall, which may serve as a potential indicator for bacterial pneumonia [29], resulting in the destruction of bronchial wall structure and proliferation of fibrous tissue fibrosis [19]. It is more likely to present in severe COVID-19 patients but rarely in ordinary patients at the early stage. All three signs strongly indicated non-COVID-19 infection and were taken as distinctive negative scoring points.",

When tested in our group of suspected COVID-19 cases, the scoring system achieved good diagnosis performance with AUC = 0.854 (95%CI: 0.752\u20130.926). Our larger cohorts and good-to-excellent diagnostic performance confirmed a similar study of Himoto et al. [30] in Japan with simpler criteria and moderate-to-excellent inter-reader concordance. Their study proposed a statistically proven powerful tool for triaging patients based on positive COVID-19 image features while ours added some negative values. Using a score > 4 as a cut-off, our scoring system showed a high specificity of 95.35% (95%CI: 84.2 to 99.4%) and made only 2 false-positive diagnoses (false-positive rate: 4.65%); a score > 4 could be strongly suspected for COVID-19. For suspected cases with a score > 4, even negative results were shown several times by RT-PCR; hence, we still suggest that repeat RT-PCR testing is necessary. If using a score > 0 as the diagnostic cut-off, the sensitivity is 100% with no false-negative (0%) diagnoses of COVID-19; thus cases with scores \u22640 are less likely to be COVID-19. We can exclude COVID-19 in these cases with more confidence and reduce the testing by RT-PCR. Patients with scores of 0\u20134 should be classified as suspected COVID-19 and be quarantined under medical surveillance followed by at least two RT-PCR tests according to the suggestion of the newest edition of guidelines.",
