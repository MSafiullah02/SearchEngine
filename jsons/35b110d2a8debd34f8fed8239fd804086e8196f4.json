J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused considerable disruption across the world, resulting in more than 235,000 deaths since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. Objective To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene.",
