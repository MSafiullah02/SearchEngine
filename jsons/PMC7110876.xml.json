A study of 75 patients from the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong did not find an association of total lymphocyte counts and progression to ventilatory support and intensive care,10 although there are differences in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), oxygen saturation and gastrointestinal symptoms in these two cohorts. However, an association of lymphopenia with more severe disease was seen in another cohort of SARS cases from Hong Kong.6 In contrast with other series of adult SARS cases, in the study reported here all patients had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection. In two series totalling 25 children with probable or suspect SARS (although only four children had laboratory-proven SARS), total lymphopenia was common and more prominent in older children with more severe disease.13, 14\n",

A significant CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lymphopenia has been observed in the first two weeks of the SARS illness in 31 patients,11 but in this study, a more prolonged CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia was noted. CD4+ and CD8+ cells fell by approximately one half in the second week of the illness before returning to near normal by the end of week 5. In addition, patients with more severe disease had lower counts that took longer to rise. The data show that the CD4+ and CD8+ counts were lower in more severely ill patients and in those that died. The CD4+/CD8+ ratios were not significantly different in the various patient groups. CD19+ B lymphocytes were the first lymphocytes to numerically recover after two weeks and their recovery was associated with the appearance of SARS-CoV specific IgG and IgM. CD16/56+ NK cells also began to decrease in the first week (although there was a rise in NK cells towards the end of week 1) to their lowest levels during week 4, and had not returned to normal by week 5.",

Total and subset lymphopenia occurs in other acute (e.g. measles, cytomegalovirus) and chronic (e.g. HIV) viral infections in humans and animals, but lymphopenia has not been a feature of other human coronavirus infections in adults.15, 16, 17 Lymphopenia has been described in some cases of experimental coronavirus 229E infections in humans.18 A possible reason for the lymphopenia may be that lymphocytes are directly infected and destroyed by SARS-CoV. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a functional cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV, a protein that is not expressed on B or T lymphocytes.19, 20 This would suggest that direct viral invasion and destruction of lymphocytes is not a major cause of the acute lymphopenia in SARS, but this requires further study.",

Apoptosis has been observed in vitro in measles-induced lymphopenia,22 and coronavirus 229E can cause in vitro apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages.23 Whether different strains of SARS-CoV have variable effects on immune responses and clinical disease (as occurs with experimental measles in macaques)24 is unknown. It is possible that the SARS-CoV-induced immune suppression predisposes to secondary infections, especially in the more severely ill patients, and it is unknown if there are any longer term effects on humoral or cell-mediated immunity following SARS.",
