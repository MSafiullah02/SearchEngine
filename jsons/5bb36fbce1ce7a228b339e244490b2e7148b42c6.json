            "text": "Background: Smartphones have become an indispensable part of the daily lives of adolescents in the 21st century, which is characterized by a highly digitized modern world. Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t-test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers' education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem. The content used in the education program includes strategies that originally aimed at increasing consumption. The effectiveness of the program can be enhanced further in the future along with self-regulatory additions.",

Even the mere existence of a smartphone on a table when studying was found to result in reduced cognitive capacity and up to a 10% decrease in IQ [23, 24] . Studies show that it takes 23 min on average for a fully concentrated individual to come back to the previous state after being interrupted with a notification message [25] . Worsening the case, the probability that the individual will self-interrupt increases by 8%.",

As an example, Instagram and some other social media platforms changed their infinite scroll feature so that the users can scroll back up to two days. Again, as of 2019, Instagram started to hide the number of 'likes' to a post to avoid a meaningless competition of having more likes.",

Undertaking such a study in Turkey is especially important since Turkey is classified as one of the countries with the highest risk potential of problematic smartphone use.

These concerns arise out of the degree and type of engagement between the brand and consumers due to the highly engaging gamified experience.

This allows consumers to take the action step literally in an effortless manner. Auto-activation of the smartphone camera by a single swipe and the similar features serve the same goal. The next step is the variable reward. It is what the notification is all about. For example, the user might have uploaded a photo album that consists of many photos. The variable reward is the discovery of which photo got the most likes, how many likes are received in total, who have commented and what they said about the posts and so on. The fact that the reward is variable allows the unconscious to be stimulated by surprise, causing dopamine release in the brain and regarding the perception of the reward as reinforcing [55] . Immediate variable rewards work perfectly well when the brain is in the unconscious mode [55] by gradually associating the reward with the trigger.",

The flow state is a state of mind characterized with enjoyment and perceptual distortion in time and space contributing to the addictive behavior [36] . The Hook model could be classified as a more sophisticated form of gamification since it targets the unconscious, applying gamification elements such as variable rewards and is designed to be addictive in nature. In this study, both hook and gamification strategies will be included in the education program considering their potential to create new habitual behavior [30] .",

Afterwards, steps that could be taken to prevent the problem were introduced. On WhatsApp, for example, the adolescents were advised to avoid immediate reply to not-so-urgent incoming messages and to put a deliberate delay so that the other party's anticipation for an immediate reply was lowered. Then, the educator taught the participants to build the communication rules and facilitate the quality of social communication without phone. Recent studies showed that 72% of adolescents (as opposed to 48% of adults) feel an urge to respond to an incoming call or a message immediately [63] . This phenomenon can be attributed to the wrong interpersonal communication etiquette as well as low self-control and peer pressure.

The problematic smartphone use did not differ on the basis of gender nor has been associated with age. Only the problematic smartphone use differs for grades and parental education. The second hypothesis, which constitutes the main objective of this study, is about inquiring the effectiveness of a novel education program for reducing problematic smartphone use in adolescents. In order to achieve this, a marketing based education program has been developed and then later measured the effect before and three weeks after the program. The change in problematic smartphone use showed a significant decrease. Moreover, the last hypothesis is related to the demographic factors, specifically gender, age and grades. These demographics are critical in order to understand which ones differed after the education for future references.

Thus, the first hypothesis of this study is rejected confirming the previous studies [59, 60] . There are many studies that indicated female addiction is higher than males [64] [65] [66] . These studies attribute females' higher tendency for mobile addiction to females' being more likely to engage in interpersonal communication and social relationships via their mobile phone [67, 68] . Moreover, Demirci et al.'s (2014) study conducted in Turkey indicated higher SASA scores for female participants. The fact that the difference between boys and girls is not significant in this present study can be explained first by age factor. The participants of this study consisted of adolescents while Demirci et al.'s (2014) study consisted of college students. Second, not only the age group might have brought out the discrepancy between these studies but also the six years' difference (2014-2020) might have changed the rates. Indeed, gender gap is predicted to decrease over the years with the advances in technology spreads, which also explains the current gender similarity in terms of addiction [69] . The total SASA scores of the adolescents in this study (girls were 84.99 and boys were 81.06) are higher but the gender difference has closed compared to previous findings [60] as (females were 78.7 and males were 72.2). As a matter of fact, this finding confirm that the gender gap is closing and problematic smartphone use has gradually become more prevalent among adolescents in recent years [32] .",

This fact might be due to the more conservative nature of families in Turkey [75] in which adolescents are still protected closely. Finally, the social network dependence factor did not change significantly after the education. The two items that measured social dependence did include social applications as Facebook and Twitter.
