These figures are likely to be an underestimate as hepatitis infection often shows no symptoms. Only 26.0% of the cases in 2017 included data on the mode of transmission, the most common of which was injecting drug use accounting for 44.0% of those cases with complete information on transmission status [1]. WHO in 2016 recommended a dramatic scale-up of HCV testing and linkage to care to achieve elimination of HCV by 2030 [2]. HCV screening and treatment interventions carry a double public health benefit: reducing both morbidity and incidence through a treatment-as-prevention effect [3].",

There are also barriers to providers wishing to offer HCV screening, including time constraints, lack of specific knowledge about HCV and discomfort in asking about risk behaviours [4]. Peer counselling offered in community-based voluntary counselling and testing (CBVCT) services can help men who have sex with men (MSM) overcome additional barriers to testing such as homophobia and internalised homonegativity [5]. The WHO recommends that CBVCT services form part of a country\u2019s national testing strategy, including testing by trained non-medical professionals. Many CBVCT services, recognising the needs of their clients, have moved beyond HIV screening and now offer screening for HCV and syphilis [6].",

Services are heterogenous, variously targeting the general population or mix of key populations; (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), migrants or sex workers (SW). Clients enter CBVCT services seeking an anonymous and confidential HIV, hepatitis C or syphilis screening. Not all services offer testing for all diseases. The HCV screening tests detect antibodies to HCV in human serum, plasma or whole blood (giving result: reactive/unreactive). Clients with a reactive specimen then require referral for an RNA test to identify current HCV infection (giving result: active HCV infection/no active HCV infection). RNA testing is not part of the standard offer for CBVCT services but they can report to the COBATEST data collection tool if they have the result of the RNA test performed at another site. The COBATEST Network began in 2013 with the goal of homogenizing the monitoring and evaluation of HIV testing activities at the community level [8, 9] and later expanded to syphilis and HCV screening. The standardised data collection tools collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, reasons for testing, previous HIV/HCV/syphilis screening testing, risk behaviours, HIV/HCV/syphilis screening test results, linkage to care. Since 2014 this data has been collected and centralised in a single database. In 2018, 45 organisations in 20 countries in the WHO European region submitted data on their testing activity.",

For this study, all disaggregated data submitted before the censuring date of 28 February 2019 was included. CBVCT services use a unique Client Identification Code to anonymise the client data and allow the identification of repeat testers. In the case that one person was screened multiple times for HCV over the study period, only the most recent HCV screening test was included in the study. Those with no reported HCV screening test result or aged under 16 were removed from the analysis. The flowchart of inclusion criteria is presented in Fig. 1.

Although this sample is not representative of all CBVCT services in Europe or CBVCT services in each country, it may reflect the increasing number of CBVCT services offering HCV screening. The rising number of tests performed in the network comes with a decrease in proportion of reactive HCV tests, reflecting services increasingly offering screening to populations at low risk of HCV.

We found a high proportion of reactive HCV tests in PWID, in line with the lower end of the estimated range from the ECDC (7\u201395.4%) [11]. The low number of PWID tested reflects the fact that PWID are not the target population for the majority of the CBVCT services in this study. PWID could benefit from improved access to services offering HCV screening which are tailored to their needs. Peer counselling for this group has been suggested as a way to destigmatise testing [12].",

HIV + MSM account for a small fraction of all people tested but show a high proportion of reactive tests, reflecting studies that find the HCV burden in MSM is concentrated in HIV + MSM [13]. The COBATEST questionnaire does not collect enough information to identify other sub-populations of MSM at higher risk of HCV such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users. A study in France in 2016-early 2017 found the incidence of primary HCV in HIV + MSM similar to that of HIV-MSM who use PrEP and recommends both groups should be targeted for HCV screening (Cotte et al. [14]. ECDC public health guidance for HCV testing recommends that MSM, trans people and SW be tested for HCV every 6\u201312 months depending on ongoing risk (sexualised drug use, PrEP or PEP use, HIV infection, history of rectal bacterial STI), that PWID be tested up to every 6 months and migrants be tested once with re-testing based on individual risk assessment [15]. To assess clients\u2019 ongoing risk, from the beginning of 2019 the COBATEST data collection tool will collect information on PrEP use and chemsex.",

The study includes services in 10 countries but the results are not representative of all CBVCT activity in these countries, nor in the European region, and therefore cannot be generalised to the region. We do not have complete information on how centres select who to screen for HCV, and why over 84,000 clients were screened for HIV and not HCV. There was a high proportion of missing data for some variables but, according to the sensitivity analysis, the estimated effect of this was minimal. There are issues with the data quality and documentation at service level which have been identified in a recent study [10] and have not all yet been resolved. CBVCT services offer anonymous and confidential screening services, and no on-site RNA test, thus it is unsurprising that there is a high percentage of missing information on RNA tests. In order to understand if CBVCT services are diagnosing active HCV infections, the reporting of RNA tests and results should be improved. This could be achieved by collaborating with local infectious disease clinics or laboratories to share RNA test results with the consent of the client. Further investigation is needed to understand if CBVCT services have functional linkage to care pathways for clients with a reactive HCV screening test.",

CBVCT services that historically focussed on HIV testing are now expanding to offer screening for HCV and other diseases. This could boost testing coverage, especially for key populations, which is an essential element of any European country\u2019s strategy to eliminate HCV. Countries should incorporate the CBVCT service model as part of a national strategy to increase HCV diagnosis and linkage to care in order to reduce the burden of disease. Governments can support CBVCT services by facilitating circuits that allow fast referral to an RNA test for clients who have had a reactive HCV screening and ensure linkage to care for those with an active infection.",
