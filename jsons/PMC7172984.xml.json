            "text": "Over the past two decades, tremendous attempts have been made to discover antiviral drugs that effectively treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (De Clercq, 2015, De Clercq, 2012, De Clercq, 2014, Welzel et al., 2014, De Clercq and Li, 2016). The first generation of FDA-approved HCV drugs includes: interferon alfacon-1 (approval year: 1997, discontinued in 2013 due to severe adverse events), ribavirin (1998), pegylated interferon alfa-2b (2001), and pegylated interferon alfa-2a (2002). These drugs had low cure rates and may cause severe adverse events (Manns et al., 2006); yet they have been the only standard-of-care treatments over a decade and are still popular in several countries. Subsequently, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represented a breakthrough in in vitro experiments and in clinical trials. In May 2011, telaprevir and boceprevir became the first FDA-approved drugs in the DAA class. The advent of DAAs marks a new era of anti-HCV drugs that directly target HCV proteins, offering promising cure rates and minimum adverse events. Similar to cocktail therapies against human immunodeficiency virus, combination therapies that target different stages of the HCV life cycle have been conceived to avoid cross-resistance. Importantly, their cure rates could attain more than 90% in clinical trials and real-world cohorts. Forthcoming therapies are endowed with higher cure rates, shorter treatment duration, lesser side effects, while being based upon all-oral regimens.",

We searched literature in PubMed using the keywords of HCV drugs within the publication period from 2013/01/01 to 2016/10/01. To search the most recent publications that are unavailable in PubMed, similar queries were also performed by visiting the websites of eleven journals (NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, Lancet infectious diseases, Gut, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Journal of hepatology, The American Journal of Gastroenterology, Annals of Internal Medicine). Only clinical trials in the phase 2, 3 and 4 stages were considered, while case reports were excluded from our literature review because of their small samples and rare subjects. We also extracted information about clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) or the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT, https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/index.html). Clinical studies in the drug labeling of the FDA (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov) were also included in our literature search. Three exclusion criteria were undertaken. First, data from the meta-analysis or reports that summarized clinical trials in other publications were not considered so as to avoid duplicates. Second, publications (e.g. HCV-TARGET (Terrault et al., 2016), real-world study (Backus et al., 2016)) that reported the coinfections with HCV and other infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, HBV) were not collected because coinfections were beyond the focus of our review. Third, in order to highlight the SVR rates of antiviral drugs in each HCV genotype, only publications that clearly addressed SVR rates of HCV therapies in individual genotypes were summarized. Moreover, we communicated with every corresponding author if SVR rates in certain patient groups were not addressed in a publication. By doing so, we managed to obtain SVR data from most publications except for a phase 2 study (Osinusi et al., 2013), the ANRS C023 CUPILT study (Coilly et al., 2016), the A1444040 study (Sulkowski et al., 2014a), the C-EDGE Head-2-Head study (Sperl et al., 2016), and the C-EDGE treatment-experienced study (Kwo et al., 2017).",

Now, HCV can be found in worldwide populations (Shepard et al., 2005), while the immediate sources of HCV associated with its pandemic spread have been traced to the circulation in Central and West sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia over hundreds of years (Simmonds, 2013). Although its origin remains unclear, HCV might have originated from zoonotic sources such as non-human primates (e.g. monkeys, apes) and mammals (e.g. dogs, horses) (Simmonds, 2013). As of today, HCV has been recognized as one of the most lethal infectious diseases next to measles, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus (Mortality, 2016, Disease et al., 2016). According to the WHO global health survey, 130 to 150 million people are currently living with HCV, causing approximately 700,000 deaths every year. Importantly, more than 95% of HCV-infected patients are unaware of their status in worldwide populations (Cox, 2015).",

Due to the sequence variation of different HCV strains, 7 genotypes (genotypes 1 to 7) have been recognized and their global prevalence is unequally distributed. Among 7 HCV genotypes, genotype 1 (46.2%) and 3 (30.1%) dominate the global infections; genotypes 2, 4, and 6 circulate in approximately 22.8% of HCV infections; genotype 5 accounts for the remaining less than 1% (Messina et al., 2015); genotype 7 has been identified so far in very few patients originating from Central Africa (Murphy et al., 2015). It is worth mentioning that the nucleotide diversity of HCV genomes is approximately 32.4% between HCV genotypes, and 14.6% within HCV genotypes (Cuypers et al., 2015). An average of 1.3 \u00d7 1012 virions are produced per day in each HCV-infected patient (Neumann et al., 1998).

Although HCV can circulate in many human organs, it infects predominately hepatocytes in the liver and evades the host innate and adaptive immune system (Rehermann, 2009). With an incubation period of 2\u201312 weeks, HCV infection begins with an acute phase that usually goes undiagnosed, during which symptomatic infections (10%\u201315%) and asymptomatic infections (85%\u201390%) are observed (Maheshwari et al., 2008). Approximately, 25%\u201352% of symptomatic infections and 10%\u201315% of asymptomatic infections undertake spontaneous viral clearance, indicating that HCV is cleared from HCV-infected patients by specific immune responses (Maheshwari et al., 2008). If not cleared, acute HCV evolves into chronic HCV. Without proper treatment, patients with chronic HCV are threatened by serious complications such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure (Thrift et al., 2017). Of note, liver damage is the consequence of long-lasting inflammation when host immune responses are activated to fight HCV infections (Antonelli et al., 2008).",

Advanced cirrhosis eventually causes end-stage liver disease and liver failure with debilitating symptoms such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Ge and Runyon, 2016). As the most common type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma can be found in 1%\u20133% of HCV-infected patients over three decades (El-Serag, 2012).

Similar to genome-wide protein interactions in human immunodeficiency virus (Li and De Clercq, 2016), HCV proteins cooperatively play multiple functions that take part in different stages of the viral life cycle (Dubuisson and Cosset, 2014, Bartenschlager et al., 2013). Major functions of HCV proteins are briefly described herein. (i) The core protein is the key element to form viral nucleocapsid that encapsulates HCV RNA genome inside viral particles. (ii) Envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 constitute a non-covalent complex that takes part in receptor binding and fusion processes during the viral entry. (iii) The non-structural protein p7 in the form of hexamers has a cation channel activity and plays multiple roles in viral particle maturation and release (Scull et al., 2015). (iv) The NS2-NS3 autoprotease cleaves the link between NS2 and NS3 in the same polyprotein during the HCV polyprotein processing. (v) NS3 protease with its cofactor NS4A in a structural complex cleaves four links (NS3-NS4A, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B) in the polyprotein to release NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B for their maturation. (vi) NS4B induces the formation of the membranous web which serves as the principle site of viral replication and assembly (Egger et al., 2002, Gosert et al., 2003). (vii) The NS5A phosphoprotein is a replicase factor that interacts with many other viral and host proteins to regulate HCV replication (Bartenschlager et al., 2013). (viii) The NS5B polymerase is the key enzyme that synthesizes viral RNA to produce new viral particles. Overall, ten HCV proteins play important roles in the viral life cycle, making them potential drug targets to inhibit HCV replication and infection. More details about HCV life cycle can be found in other reviews (Bartenschlager et al., 2013, Moradpour et al., 2007, Scheel and Rice, 2013, Lindenbach and Rice, 2005, Bartenschlager et al., 2011).",

Known drug targets include one non-structural protein (NS5A) and two HCV enzymes (NS3/4A, NS5B) (De Clercq, 2014). Three drug targets therefore offer ideal drug binding pockets for the design of HCV combination therapies, leading to the tremendous success of pan-genotypic therapies (e.g. Epclusa\u00ae) with more than 90% of sustained virologic response. Approved DAA combination therapies are commonly composed of two or three compounds that inhibit either NS3/4A, NS5A, or NS5B with different mechanism of drug action (Fig. 1). In comparison to individual compounds, combination therapies offer much higher efficacy to inhibit HCV infections.",

            "text": "Four classes of drug actions have been discovered. First, NS3/4A inhibitors (e.g. asunaprevir, boceprevir, telaprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, simeprevir, vaniprevir, voxilaprevir) can inhibit the enzymatic activity of NS3/4A. Second, NS5A inhibitors (e.g. daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, elbasvir, velpatasvir) might inhibit replication complex formation at the endoplasmic reticulum and sequester NS5A in lipid droplets to inhibit virus formation and release (Nettles et al., 2014). Without affecting the stability and dimerization of NS5A, NS5A inhibitors not only block HCV RNA synthesis at the stage of membranous web biogenesis (Berger et al., 2014), but also impair viral assembly by inhibiting the delivery of HCV genomes to assembly sites (Boson et al., 2017). In spite of their high potency, NS5A inhibitors slowly inhibit HCV RNA synthesis in comparison to HCV protease or polymerase inhibitors (McGivern et al., 2014). It is also worth mentioning that the cooperation interaction between pairs of NS5A inhibitors may enhance drug resistance barrier and restore antiviral activity against NS5A resistance variants (Sun et al., 2015). Third, nucleotide inhibitors (e.g. sofosbuvir triphosphate) bind to the catalytic site of NS5B and compete with incoming nucleoside triphosphates to interrupt the RNA synthesis. Fourth, non-nucleotide inhibitors (e.g. dasabuvir) bind to the allosteric binding pockets outside the NS5B catalytic site based on the non-competitive mechanisms of action that inhibit the RNA synthesis (Gotte and Feld, 2016). In addition to these known drug binding sites, alternative drug targets in other viral and host proteins have been explored by experimental drugs. The following sections provide more details about the approved and experimental drugs.",

After the failure of screening efforts over four million compounds, boceprevir was derived from an \u03b1-ketoamide (Fig. 2) using structure-based drug design approaches (Njoroge et al., 2008). The advancement of structure-based drug design was promoted by the discovery of NS3 protease crystal structures revealed in 1996 (Kim et al., 1996, Love et al., 1996). As a potent NS3 protease inhibitor, boceprevir blocks the serine hydroxyl of HCV NS3/4A protease (Njoroge et al., 2008). According to in vitro experiments, the EC50 values of boceprevir were 196 \u00b1 56 nM against GT-1a, 251 \u00b1 71 nM against GT-1b, 283 \u00b1 36 nM against GT-2a, 315 \u00b1 30 nM against GT-2b, and 159 \u00b1 5 nM against GT-3a (Silva et al., 2013).

Here, we summarize SVR24 rates of this therapy against genotype 1 infections in regard to cirrhosis and prior treatment history (Table 4\n). For treatment-na\u00efve patients without cirrhosis, SVR24 rates reached 59.2% (87/147) in the HCV-TARGET study (Sterling et al., 2015), 64% (387/604) in a phase 3 study (Poordad et al., 2013), 76.3% (74/97) in the SPRINT-1 study (Kwo et al., 2010), and 67.4% (223/331) in the SPRINT-2 study (Poordad et al., 2011). For treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis, SVR24 rates were 41.7% (68/163) in the HCV-TARGET study (Sterling et al., 2015), 64.1% (86/134) in a phase 3 study (Flamm et al., 2013), 66.4% (17/22) in the RESPOND-2 study (Bacon et al., 2011), and 64.2% (104/162) in the PROVIDE study (Vierling et al., 2014). For treatment-na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis, SVR24 rates were approximately 32%\u201355% in phase 2 or 3 studies (Sterling et al., 2015, Poordad et al., 2011, Poordad et al., 2013, Kwo et al., 2010). As for treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis, SVR24 rates were between 31.1% and 77.3% in clinical trials (Table 3). Although boceprevir plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV was the first FDA-approved therapy, its efficacy was superseded by new DAAs, and its discontinuation was announced by Merck in 2015.",

Telaprevir (formerly VX-950) in combination with PegIFN\u03b1/RBV was the second FDA-approved therapy against HCV genotype 1 infections (Table 1). Illustrated in Fig. 2, telaprevir was discovered from a viral NS5A/5B substrate (sequence: EDVVCCSMSY) of the HCV protease using structure-based drug design approaches (Kwong et al., 2011). The principle was based on the fact that HCV protease could be inhibited by its own cleavage products (Kwong et al., 2011), a mechanism similar to protease inhibitors explored for HIV (Li and De Clercq, 2016). Telaprevir is a reversible noncovalent NS3 inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in HCV cell cultures and animal models. Moreover, the EC50 values of telaprevir reached 252 \u00b1 54 nM to 953 \u00b1 103 nM in HCV GT1, GT2, and GT3 replicon assays (Silva et al., 2013).",

Table 6 illustrates the efficacy of 400 mg sofosbuvir QD plus ribavirin at 12 weeks in clinical studies such as POSITRON (Jacobson et al., 2013), FUSION (Jacobson et al., 2013), Electron (Gane et al., 2013a), FISSION (Lawitz et al., 2013a), and HCV-TARGET (Feld et al., 2016a, Welzel et al., 2016a). The SVR12 rates were approximately 62.8% (22/35) against GT1, 90.8% (750/826) against GT2, 55% (297/540) against GT3, and 73.4% (61/83) against GT4. Table 7 illustrates the efficacy of 400 mg sofosbuvir QD plus ribavirin at 24 weeks in clinical studies such as ASTRAL-2 (Foster et al., 2015b), ASTRAL-3 (Foster et al., 2015b), VALENCE (Zeuzem et al., 2014a), and BOSON (Foster et al., 2015a). SVR12 rates were approximately 58.7% (37/63) against GT1, 100% (17/17) against GT2, 82.4% (610/740) against GT3, and 90.1% (73/81) against GT4. Moreover, recurrent HCV infections after liver transplantation in patients, including those with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and decompensated cirrhosis, might be treated by sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, achieving modest efficacy (SVR12: 59%) (Forns et al., 2015a). The most common side effects of sofosbuvir plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia.",

Simeprevir (formerly TMC435) is a potent inhibitor targeting HCV NS3/4A (Rosenquist et al., 2014) (Fig. 2). It is worth mentioning that the NS3/4A inhibitor simeprevir in the combination with the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir is considered to efficiently inhibit different stages of HCV life cycle \u2013 a principle in line with the standard cocktail treatment for HIV. Simeprevir was discovered during the extensive exploration of novel P2 cyclopentane macrocyclic inhibitors using HCV NS3 protease assays, the cellular replicon system, and structure-based design (Rosenquist et al., 2014). Moreover, EC50 values of simeprevir were 28.4 nM and 8.1 nM in Huh7-derived replicon cells with genotype 1a (strain: H77) or genotype 1b (con1b), respectively (Lin et al., 2009). Indeed, simeprevir showed excellent in vitro and in vivo biological, antiviral and safety pharmacology profiles, which paved its way to clinical trials.",

We attempted to estimate drug efficacy by merging all clinical data regardless of the distinct nature between different clinical trials. (i) For the treatment of 150 mg simeprevir plus 400 mg sofosbuvir QD at 12w, its SVR12 reached 93.8% (407/434) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, 97.9% (476/486) in GT4-infected patients without cirrhosis, 81.7% (371/454) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis, 84.8% (84/99) in GT4-infected patients with cirrhosis (Table 8\n). (ii) Regarding the treatment of 150 mg simeprevir plus 400 mg sofosbuvir QD for 24w, its SVR12 reached 96.9% (31/32) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 100% (10/10) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis (Table 8). (iii) Regarding the treatment of 150 mg simeprevir QD plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 12w + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 12w, its SVR12 reached 76.2% (1087/1426) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, 50.2% (88/175) in GT1- infected patients with cirrhosis (Table 9\n). (iv) Regarding the treatment of 150 mg simeprevir QD plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 12w + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 36w, its SVR12 reached 83.2% (252/303) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, 65.9% (29/44) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis (Table 10\n). In the RESTORE study, patients received simeprevir plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 12w followed by PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 12w or 36w (Moreno et al., 2015). SVR12 rates were 66.6% (72/108) in GT4-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 40.8% (20/49) in GT4-infected patients with cirrhosis. Furthermore, 12w of simeprevir plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV followed by additional 36w of PegIFN\u03b1/RBV was approved for patients co-infected with HIV and HCV infections. In clinical studies, the most common side effects of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir were fatigue, headache and nausea, while simeprevir plus sofosbuvir may have caused common adverse events such as rash, pruritus, nausea, and photosensitivity reactions.",

Ledipasvir is a potent NS5A inhibitor (Fig. 3), while the nucleotide analogue sofosbuvir targets NS5B to inhibit its activity (Fig. 4). Ledipasvir (formerly GS-5885) was discovered through a series of modifications in an unsymmetric benzimidazole-difluorofluorene-imidazole core and distal [2.2.1] azabicyclic ring system (Link et al., 2014). In HCV replicon assays, the EC50 values of ledipasvir were 0.031 nM against GT1a, 0.004 nM against GT1b, 21 nM against GT2a, 16 nM against GT2b, 168 nM against GT3a, 0.39 nM against GT4a, 0.15 nM against GT5a, and 1.1 nM against GT6a (Cheng et al., 2016). Pharmacokinetic studies in animal models (e.g. rats, dogs, monkeys) further supported the potent antiviral activity of ledipasvir (Link et al., 2014).",

For instance, the SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies indicated that the ledipasvir + sofosbuvir + ribavirin therapy for 12 weeks led to high rates of SVR12 (>85%) even in patients with decompensated cirrhotic before and after liver transplantation (Charlton et al., 2015b, Manns et al., 2016). Here, we attempted to estimate drug efficacy by merging all clinical data regardless of the distinct nature between different clinical trials. (i) Regarding the treatment of 400 mg sofosbuvir + 90 mg ledipasvir QD for 12 weeks, the SVR12 rates were 96.1% (3674/3824) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 92.2% (867/940) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis, 91.6% (44/48) in GT4-infected patients without cirrhosis, 96.8% (31/32) in GT5-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 95.6% (22/23) in GT6-infected patients without cirrhosis (Table 11\n). (ii) Regarding the treatment of 90 mg ledipasvir + 400 mg sofosbuvir QD for 24 weeks, its SVR12 reached 99.3% (266/268) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 96.9% (127/131) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis. (iii) Regarding the therapy of 90 mg ledipasvir + 400 mg sofosbuvir QD with ribavirin for 12 weeks, SVR12 rates were 98.9% (467/472) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 93.3% (393/421) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis (Table 12\n). Moreover, the drug resistant mutations at baseline exerted minimal effects on patient responses to the therapy of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir (Sarrazin et al., 2016). The most common adverse events with the treatment of Harvoni\u00ae were headache, fatigue and asthenia.",

            "text": "In December 2014, the FDA approved the fixed-dose combination tablets of paritaprevir + ombitasvir + ritonavir copackaged with dasabuvir (Viekira Pak\u2122). Regarding the mechanisms of drug action, paritaprevir (formerly ABT-450), ombitasvir (ABT-267), and dasabuvir (ABT-333) are antiviral inhibitors against HCV NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B proteins, respectively. In addition to its known function as a booster to HIV protease inhibitors (De Clercq and Li, 2016), ritonavir in Viekira Pak\u2122 effectively inhibits human gene CYP3A encoding important enzymes in the human body that oxidize small foreign organic molecules for drug metabolism. The inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism of paritaprevir thus increases the plasma concentration of paritaprevir. In replicon cell lines, paritaprevir demonstrates potent activities against different genotypes, and the EC50 values of paritaprevir were estimated to be 1.0 \u00b1 0.33 nM against GT1a, 0.21 \u00b1 0.07 nM against GT1b, 5.3 \u00b1 1.2 nM against GT2a, 19 \u00b1 5.2 nM against GT3a, 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 nM against GT4a, and 0.69 \u00b1 0.09 nM against GT6a (Pilot-Matias et al., 2015). Based on cell-culture experiments, it has been shown that EC50 values of ombitasvir were approximately 14.1 \u00b1 6.8 pM against GT1a, 5.0 \u00b1 1 pM against GT1b, 12.4 \u00b1 2.7 pM against GT2a, 4.3 \u00b1 1.2 pM against GT2b, 19.3 \u00b1 5.8 pM against GT3a, 1.71 \u00b1 0.88 pM against GT4a, 4.3 \u00b1 0.9 pM against GT5a, and 415 \u00b1 97 pM against GT6a (DeGoey et al., 2014). Regarding the discovery of ombitasvir, it was optimized from a symmetric series of N-phenylpyrrolidine-based inhibitors with chiral pyrrolidine-based cores (DeGoey et al., 2014) (Fig. 3). As for dasabuvir (Fig. 5), it is a nonnucleoside inhibitor that targets the allosteric site within the NS5B palm region (Liu et al., 2012). The EC50 values of dasabuvir were 7.7 nM against GT1a and 1.8 nM against GT1b in replicon cell lines (Kati et al., 2015).",

Here, we summarize the efficacy of Viekira Pak\u2122 in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, including PEARL-II (Andreone et al., 2014), PEARL-III (Ferenci et al., 2014), PEARL-IV (Ferenci et al., 2014), SAPPHIRE-I (Feld et al., 2014), RUBY-I (Pockros et al., 2016), AVIATOR (Kowdley et al., 2014b), MALACHITE-I (Dore et al., 2016a), MALACHITE-II (Dore et al., 2016a), TURQUOISE-II (Poordad et al., 2014), TURQUOISE-III (Feld et al., 2016b), and SAPPHIRE-II (Zeuzem et al., 2014c). (i)\nTable 13\nhighlights the efficacy of 12.5 mg ombitasvir + 75 mg paritaprevir + 50 mg ritonavir once-daily fixed-dose two pills plus 250 mg dasabuvir BID for 12w. We attempted to estimate drug efficacy by merging all clinical data regardless of the distinct nature between different clinical trials. The SVR12 rates of this regimen reached 96.9% (1065/1099) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 100% (84/84) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis.

Based on clinical studies, the SVR12 rates of this therapy reached 96.4% (2518/2612) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 95.7% (630/658) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis. (iii)\nTable 15\nillustrates the efficacy of 12.5 mg ombitasvir + 75 mg paritaprevir + 50 mg ritonavir fixed-dose two pills QD plus 250 mg dasabuvir BID plus ribavirin for 24w. In the TURQUOISE-II study, SVR12 rates reached 95.9% (165/172) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis (Poordad et al., 2014). Overall, the SVR12 rates of Viekira Pak\u2122 achieved above 90% in the treatment of GT1-infected patients with or without cirrhosis. The most common side effects of Viekira Pak\u2122 in these clinical studies were fatigue, nausea, skin rash, pruritus, insomnia, and asthenia.",

Noteworthy, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir bind to the NS5A and NS5B proteins, respectively. Daclatasvir (BMS-790052) was designed by the extensive optimization of a leading iminothiazolidinone (Fig. 3) obtained from the high throughput phenotypic screening (Belema and Meanwell, 2014). Daclatasvir in the symmetric and dimeric form may bind at positions 31 and 93 of HCV NS5A, thus interfering with the protein-protein interactions at the membrane interface (Nettles et al., 2014). Moreover, the cooperative interaction between daclatasvir and other NS5A inhibitors (e.g. syn-395) suggests the possible synergistic anti-HCV activity, providing additional options for HCV combination therapy (Sun et al., 2015). In HCV replicons, the EC50 values of daclatasvir achieved 0.05 \u00b1 0.013 nM against GT1a, 0.009 \u00b1 0.004 nM against GT1b, 0.071 \u00b1 0.017 nM against GT2a, 0.146 \u00b1 0.034 nM against GT3a, 0.012 \u00b1 0.004 nM against GT4a, and 0.033 \u00b1 0.01 nM against GT5a (Table 2). Moreover, pharmacokinetic analyses in animal models (e.g. rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey) further supported the potent antiviral activity of daclatasvir (Belema and Meanwell, 2014). In addition to the combination of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir, daclatasvir was previously considered to be used with asunaprevir (Poordad et al., 2015, Muir et al., 2015, Toyota et al., 2016). Although the combination of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir was declined by the FDA, this regimen was approved in Japan.",

Grazoprevir (MK-5172) and elbasvir (MK-8742) bind to HCV NS3/4A and NS5A, respectively. On the one hand, grazoprevir (Fig. 2) was discovered using a molecular modeling-derived strategy that optimized the contacts of protease inhibitors with a P2-to-P4 macrocyclic ring to the HCV NS3/4A active sites (Harper et al., 2012, Liverton et al., 2008). On the other hand, elbasvir was discovered by introducing a tetracyclic indole into the early clinical candidate MK-4882 (Fig. 3) that significantly improved its virologic profiles (Coburn et al., 2013). In HCV cell-based replicons, the EC50 values of grazoprevir were 0.4 nM against GT1a, 0.5 nM against GT1b, 2.3 nM against GT2a, 2.1 nM against GT3a, 0.3 nM against GT4a, 6.6 nM against GT5a, and 0.9 nM against GT6a (Lahser et al., 2016). Meanwhile, EC50 values of elbasvir achieved 0.004 nM against GT1a, 0.003 nM against GT1b, 0.003 nM against GT2a, 0.14 nM against GT3a, 0.0003 nM against GT4a, 0.001 nM against GT5a, and 0.009 nM against GT6 (Lahser et al., 2016). The combination of grazoprevir plus elbasvir not only exhibited a potent activity against HCV replication, but harbored a higher genetic barrier to drug resistance compared to individual compounds (Lahser et al., 2016). Overall, both grazoprevir and elbasvir attained potent antiviral activities in cell culture assays and animal models (Lahser et al., 2016, Harper et al., 2012, Coburn et al., 2013).",

Here, we attempted to estimate drug efficacy by merging all clinical data regardless of the distinct nature between different clinical trials (Table 18\n). (i) Regarding the therapy of 100 mg grazoprevir QD + 50 mg elbasvir QD for 12w, the SVR12 rates were 95.5% (751/786) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, 96.3% (181/188) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis, 94.1% (32/34) in GT4-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 63.2% (12/19) in GT6-infected patients without cirrhosis (Table 18). (ii) Regarding the treatment of 100 mg grazoprevir QD + 50 mg elbasvir QD + RBV BID for 12w, its SVR12 rates fulfilled 94.6% (142/150) in GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 94.8% (73/77) in GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis. With limited number of enrolled patients described in the C-SCAPE study (Brown et al., 2015), the SVR12 rates in non-cirrhotic patients were 80% (24/30), 100% (10/10), 100% (4/4), and 75% (3/4) against GT2, GT4, GT5, or GT6 infections, respectively. Due to the enrollment of patients co-infected with HCV and HIV in the C-EDGE TE study (Kwo et al., 2017), we were unable to obtain the SVR12 data of grazoprevir + elbasvir + RBV to treat HCV mono-infections. The most common side effects of Zepatier\u2122 were anemia and headache. Furthermore, NS5A polymorphisms at 4 amino acid positions (M28, Q30, L31, Y93) may reduce the treatment efficacy in clinical trials (Komatsu et al., 2017). Overall, the combination of grazoprevir plus elbasvir with or without ribavirin is effective and safe for patients with GT1 or GT4 infections (see Table 19).",

Epclusa\u00ae is the first pan-genotypic therapy approved for the treatment of all HCV genotypes except genotype 7. While the global prevalence of genotype 7 is rather low (Murphy et al., 2015), a case report showed the treatment success of Epclusa\u00ae in one patient infected with HCV genotype 7 (Schreiber et al., 2016). As the key component of Epclusa\u00ae, velpatasvir (Fig. 3) was discovered as a second-generation NS5A inhibitor with potent antiviral activity in cell culture assays. EC50 values of velpatasvir were 0.013 nM against GT1a, 0.015 nM against GT1b, 0.009 nM against GT2a, 0.01 nM against GT2b, 0.013 nM against GT3a, 0.009 nM against GT4, 0.059 nM against GT5, and 0.007 nM against GT6 (Cheng et al., 2013). Moreover, sofosbuvir is the best-in-class NS5B inhibitor manufactured by Gilead Sciences. Thus the fast approval of sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir marks a new era of anti-HCV therapies that effectively cure the majority of HCV-infected patients regardless of HCV genotypes. Unlike most FDA-approved therapies which require 12- to 24-week treatment, Epclusa\u00ae also attained a promising efficacy at 8 weeks (Everson et al., 2015).",

The therapy of 100 mg voxilaprevir in combination with 100 mg velpatasvir plus 400 mg sofosbuvir once daily is now examined in phase 3 clinical trials. In previous phase 2 clinical trials investigating this triple-DAA therapy at 8 weeks, SVR12 rates were 100% (36/36) in treatment-na\u00efve GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, and 94% (31/33) in treatment-na\u00efve GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis (Lawitz et al., 2016c). In addition, this 12-week treatment attained an SVR12 rate of 100% in DAA-experienced patients with or without cirrhosis (Lawitz et al., 2016c). Another phase 2 study further showed its high efficacy in patients infected with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6, demonstrating that the SVR12 rates were 100% (36/36) in treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis versus 97% (28/29) in treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis (Gane et al., 2016a). The third clinical trial investigated the 4w, 6w and 8w treatment of this combination therapy against genotype 1 or 3 infections, demonstrating that 8-week treatment provided high SVR12 rates in most treatment-na\u00efve or -experienced patients with or without compensated cirrhosis (Gane et al., 2016b). In clinical trials, voxilaprevir, sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir was well-tolerated and caused mild or moderate adverse events (Lawitz et al., 2016c, Gane et al., 2016a, Gane et al., 2016b, Rodriguez-Torres et al., 2016). In October 2016, Gilead Sciences announced the latest findings from four phase 3 trials (POLARIS-1 to POLARIS-4) in which the SVR12 rates of once-daily single tablet containing voxilaprevir, sofosbuvir, and velpatasvir were more than 96% in treatment-failure patients infected with GT1 to GT6 (http://www.gilead.com/). On December 8, 2016, Gilead Sciences submitted the new drug application of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir plus voxilaprevir. Overall, this combination therapy offers short-duration treatment and potentially provides salvage therapy for DAA-experienced patients.",

This macrocyclic noncovalent reversible NS3/4A inhibitor had a slow-off rate and exhibited favorable potency across multiple HCV genotypes (Jiang et al., 2014a). The IC50 values of danoprevir (Fig. 2) were 1.6 nM against GT2b, 3.5 nM against GT3a, and 0.2 nM\u20130.4 nM against GT1a, GT1b, GT4, GT5 or GT6 infection (Jiang et al., 2014a). Moreover, danoprevir may restore the insulin sensitivity in GT1-infected patients (Moucari et al., 2010). Early clinical studies supported the clinical use of danoprevir plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV that offered modest potency and safety against GT1 infection (Gane et al., 2011, Gane et al., 2014b, Forestier et al., 2011, Marcellin et al., 2013). In the INFORM-1 trial, danoprevir plus mericitabine significantly reduced HCV RNA levels in GT1-infected patients (Gane et al., 2010). In the MATTERHORN study, the combination of danoprevir/r, mericitabine plus PegIFN\u03b1/RBV for 12 weeks was well-tolerated and yielded an SVR24 rate of 84.6% against GT1 infections (Feld et al., 2015b). In a phase 2a trial enrolling 25 GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, the four-week treatment of danoprevir, ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir exhibited an SVR12 rate of 40% (10/25) (Kohli et al., 2015c).

Additionally, alisporivir inhibits the interaction between cyclophilin A and NS5A in a dose-dependent manner (Coelmont et al., 2010). Of interest, alisporivir acts synergistically with NS5A inhibitors (e.g. daclatasvir, sofosbuvir) to achieve significant antiviral effects (Chatterji et al., 2014). Moreover, alisporivir stimulates antigen presentation and promotes antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation by 40%, thereby leading to the significant anti-HCV activity (Esser-Nobis et al., 2016). In the phase 2 VITAL-1 study enrolling GT2- or GT3-infected patients, the SVR24 rate of alisporivir plus PegIFN\u03b1 and ribavirin (92%, 56/61) was higher than that of alisporivir alone (72%, 13/18) (Pawlotsky et al., 2015).

Moreover, this study presents the first detailed survey of drug efficacy of all FDA-approved therapies based on more than 100 clinical trials and real-world studies. Similar to HIV cocktail therapies, HCV combination therapies containing two or three DAAs to block different stages of the viral life cycle can offer favorable inhibitory efficacy and low incidences of side effects. Unlike the first generation of anti-HCV drugs with pegylated interferons and ribavirin, many FDA-approved DAAs directly bind to HCV proteins (NS3/4A, NS5A, NS5B). Furthermore, the pursuit of next generation anti-HCV inhibitors yields a large number of investigational agents with novel mechanisms of drug actions. Most inhibitors have been synthesized to inhibit HCV proteins (E1/E2, p7, NS4B) or human proteins (e.g. cyclophilin A, cyclin G associated kinase, scavenger receptor B1). Accumulated over the past five years, a large pool of FDA-approved drugs and promising experimental inhibitors provides a strong reinforcement to cure HCV infections in most patients. Nevertheless, many challenges lie ahead to develop next generation DAAs against HCV infections in worldwide populations.",

It has been suggested that treating HCV-infected patients early in their disease course may prevent HCV-related cirrhosis and its complications (AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidance Panel, 2015), whilst the pre-emptive DAA treatment may benefit the prevention and treatment of liver graft infection (Felmlee et al., 2016). A recent study reported unexpected high rates of early tumor recurrence after the treatment of DAAs in 103 HCV-infected patients with prior hepatocellular carcinoma (Reig et al., 2016). Despite the high potency of DAAs, the occurrence of liver cancer cannot be reduced in HCV-infected cirrhotic patients with sustained virologic response (Conti et al., 2016). Nevertheless, a following study integrating three distinct prospective cohorts showed no increased risk of HCC recurrence in 267 patients after DAA treatments (Thecollaborative st, 2016). Whether DAA treatments increase HCC occurrence or recurrence rates will remain a subject for debate until very large patient cohorts have emerged with a proper control arm to assess this important question (Llovet and Villanueva, 2016).",

On the one hand, it is crucial to apply pan-genotypic therapies for all HCV genotypes, especially when genotyping tests are unavailable in resource-limited areas. Until today, Epclusa\u00ae is the only therapy approved for the treatment of GT1 to GT6 infections. On the other hand, drug resistance remains a concern, and natural variations in different genotypes may confer resistance to genotype-specific drugs (Sarrazin, 2016, Pawlotsky, 2016). For instance, NS5A resistance-associated substitutions were presented in 8\u201316% of GT1-infected patients prior to the treatment of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir, while their presence exerted a negative impact on treatment outcomes (Zeuzem et al., 2017). Moreover, HCV GT3 variants within the NS5A region not only reduced sensitivity to nucleotide analogues (e.g. sofosbuvir) but also increased viral fitness in cell culture systems (Ramirez et al., 2016). In addition, many NS3/4A inhibitors show potent activities against GT1 but not GT3, because of the polymorphisms between HCV genotypes in the drug binding pocket, as well as the substantial loss of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions and dynamic cross-correlations between NS3/4A inhibitors and the active site of NS3/4A in GT3 (Soumana et al., 2016). Lists of HCV resistance-associated substitutions are available at (Sarrazin, 2016, Pawlotsky, 2016). Altogether, development of pan-genotypic drugs remains important.",

In the length of approximately 3011 amino acids, the HCV genome codes for three structural proteins (core, E1, E2) and seven non-structural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) whose amino acid positions are mapped accordingly. The 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) and the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) are also indicated. Approved antiviral agents directly target to NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B for effective inhibition of HCV replications. (B) A total of 15 NS3/4A, NS5A, NS5B compounds plus ritonavir are displayed in the circle. Colored links in the center visualize 13 drug combinations: (i) boceprevir (Victrelis\u00ae) + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV, (ii) telaprevir (Incivek\u00ae) + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV, (iii) sofosbuvir (Sovaldi\u00ae) + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV, (iv) simeprevir (Olysio\u00ae) + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV, (v) ledipasvir + sofosbuvir (Harvoni\u00ae), (vi) ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir + dasabuvir (Viekira Pak\u2122), (vii) ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir (Technivie\u2122), (viii) daclatasvir (Daklinza\u2122) + sofosbuvir (Sovaldi\u00ae), (ix) elbasvir + grazoprevir (Zepatier\u2122), (x) sofosbuvir + velpatasvir (Epclusa\u00ae), (xi) vaniprevir (Vanihep\u00ae) + PegIFN\u03b1/RBV, (xii) asunaprevir (Sunvepra\u00ae) + daclatasvir (Daklinza\u00ae), (xiii) voxilaprevir + velpatasvir + sofosbuvir. Notably, (i) to (x) were approved by the FDA and could be used with or without ribavirin; (xi) and (xii) were approved in Japan; and (xiii) is currently under assessment by the FDA.
