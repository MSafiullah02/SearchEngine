            "text": "All known porcine coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, of the order Nidovirales (de Groot et al. 2008) [https://data.ictvonline.org/taxonomy-search.asp?msl_id=30 (Fig. 4.1)]. Affections of gastrointestinal, respiratory, peripheral and central nervous systems are usually visualised. Five swine CoVs are recognised: (1) the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), first defined in 1946; (2) the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a mutant of TGEV, isolated in 1984; (3) the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), isolated in 1977; (4) the PHEV (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) isolated in 1962; and (5) the PDCoV (porcine deltacoronavirus) described in 2012. The first two, TGEV and PRCV, belong to the Alphacoronavirus 1 species together with closely associated CoVs of cats and dogs, and PEDV and human CoVs (229E and NL63) form distinct species in the Alphacoronavirus genus. PHEV and PDCoV belong to the Beta- (Betacoronavirus 1 species) and Deltacoronavirus genera, respectively. PDCoV is closely related to the deltacoronaviruses from Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers (Ma et al. 2005). While PRCV induces primarily subclinical infections in pigs, enteropathogenic swine alphacoronaviruses (TGEV, PEDV, SeCoV, porcine enteric alphacoronavirus) and PDCoV are allied with a severe enteric disease of variable severity depending on the animal age and immune status. One serotype is recognised for each swine CoV species.",

Recently in Europe, a pathogenic recombinant TGEV/PEDV variant (swine enteric coronavirus, SeCoV) was recognised and described (Akimkin et al. 2016; Belsham et al. 2016; Boniotti et al. 2016). SeCoV that contains PEDV S protein on a TGEV backbone apparently leads to disease clinically indistinct from the TGEV- and PEDV-produced ones (Table 4.1). Additionally, a novel bat-HKU2-like porcine coronavirus [porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), GDS04 strain] associated with severe diarrheal disease in suckling piglets was identified in Southern China in 2017 (Gong et al. 2017) (Table 4.1).

            "text": "Currently, PHEV, the only porcine betacoronavirus, has a worldwide prevalence (Li et al. 2016). In neonatal piglets devoid of maternal antibodies (generally in those purchased from infection-free herds), PHEV causes either encephalomyelitis or a condition characterised by vomiting and wasting. Generally, maternal immunity protects piglets which have taken colostrum for up to 15 weeks, while in pigs older than 3\u20134 weeks and adult swine the infection is mostly subclinical. Therefore, it is seldom considered to be of economic importance. However, a recent report of an uncommon respiratory (influenza-like) presentation and increasing prevalence of PHEV in adult exhibition swine in the USA (Lorbach et al. 2017) may indicate a potential tropism shift that could lead to a substantial change in its epidemiology. To clear this complex epidemiological position, continuing monitoring and development of state-of-the-art rapid and reliable tools and techniques are needed to confirm and provide a clear differential diagnosis (Kim et al. 2001; Masuda et al. 2016).",

Swine CoV shaves single-stranded, polyadenylated, large genomic RNA (25\u201330 kDa) of positive-sense polarity that is infectious. The genome profile, replication strategies as well as protein expression match to other human and animal CoVs (Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst 1995; Gonzalez et al. 2003; Laude et al. 1993). Most porcine CoVs have four basic structural proteins: a large surface glycoprotein (S, spike protein that forms a monolayer of club-shaped spikes defined as the corona); a small membrane protein (E); an integral membrane glycoprotein (M); and a nucleocapsid protein (N). However, PHEV contains a haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein that forms a second shorter layer of surface spikes (de Groot et al. 2008). TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV also transcribe 1\u20132 accessory proteins encoded by open reading frame (ORF)3 (TGEV and PEDV), ORF6 (PDCoV), and ORF7 (TGEV and PDCoV). The complete genome organisation is 5\u2032UTR-ORF1ab, S, ORF3, E, M, ORF6, N and ORF7-3\u2032UTR.",

All classical PEDV strains contain inserts and omissions in the spike gene (S INDEL) that are not present in the majority of the highly virulent emerging PEDV strains (Vlasova et al. 2014). Thus, these highly virulent strains that originally emerged in China in 2010 and transmitted to the USA, Europe and other Asian parts are referred to as emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains. Recombinants between these two major groups of PEDV contain a set of deletions-insertions in their spike gene identical to those of the classical strains. They are called S INDEL strains and circulate in Asia, Europe and the USA. Additionally, a few reports described other uncommon PEDV variants that bear large deletions (194\u2013216 aa) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein and designated as S1 NTD-del type of PEDV (Diep et al. 2017; Oka et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2015). Unlike the altered tissue tropism from enteric TGEV to respiratory PRCV, these (S INDEL and S1 NTF have been reported-del) PEDV strains have kept their enteric predilection, but with lower virulence (Suzuki et al. 2016; Hou et al. 2017).",

They can cause sporadic outbreaks (endemic) or large-scale epidemics in swine-producing countries (Fig. 4.2). No specific treatments are available for any of the swine enteric CoVs that so far have resisted eradication efforts in different geographic regions. In this chapter, we have reviewed the diseases due to CoVs that continue evolving in domestic and wild swine, as well as another possible reservoir (avian or bat species) or secondary hosts including carnivores, or via the interspecies spread, recombination and generation of deletion escape variants. We also review PRCV that has lost its enteric tropism but is capable of inducing protective immune responses against TGEV that altered its global epidemiology.",

The distension of the stomach and the small intestine are seen to be filled up with curdled milk and sometimes petechial haemorrhages are visualised (Hooper and Haelterman 1966a). The small intestinal wall is thin and transparent. The villous atrophy in the jejunum and lesser in the ileum regions are the major TGE lesions and are more pronounced in neonatal pigs than in \u22653-week-old piglets (Moon 1978; Hooper and Haelterman 1966b). The increased severity of TGEV infection results in higher mortality (often 100%) in piglets less than 2 weeks of age that decreases in older pigs (Table 4.1). Although swine of any age is susceptible to TGEV, the mortality in TGEV seropositive groups and swine more than 5 weeks of age is usually low. Mechanisms that represent age-dependent susceptibility to clinical ailment comprise the slower substitution of tainted villous epithelial cells with newly differentiated enterocytes migrating from crypts in newborn pigs (Moon 1978). These lesions are similar to PEDV/PDCoV (Debouck et al. 1981; Jung et al. 2015a) lesions, but more severe than those caused by rotavirus (RV) (Bohl et al. 1978). Pathologic observations and degree of villous atrophy are exceptionally variable in pigs from endemic herds (Pritchard 1987).",

They include acute, watery diarrhoea due to malabsorption induced by the massive loss of absorptive enterocytes. Additional signs may include vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, lethargy and death. Vacuolation of the infected colonic epithelial cells may inhibit water and electrolyte reabsorption. The seronegative pigs are susceptible to PDCoV infection at any age, with high morbidity that can reach 100% in piglets. Evaluation of filed cases in the USA, China and Thailand in 2014 shows that PDCoV infection is associated with up to 40\u201380% mortality among suckling pigs (Anon 2014). The infection on breeding establishments remains self-limiting and stops when pregnant sows develop lactogenic immunity adequate to secure their offspring.",

Lesions look like those seen in TGEV and PEDV infections but are mild (Chen et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2016; Jung et al. 2015b; Ma et al. 2015). Histological findings are intense, multifocal to diffuse, mild to extreme atrophic enteritis of jejunum and ileum, at some point joined by mild vacuolation of caecal and colonic epithelial cells (Jung et al. 2015b). Amid acute infection, PDCoV antigens are available in the villous epithelium of the mid-jejunum to the ileum and a lesser degree, in the duodenum, and caecum/colon (Jung et al. 2016a). PDCoV antigens may also be noticed in immune cells of the intestinal lamina propria, Peyer\u2019s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (Hu et al. 2016). Inflammatory cell (macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil) infiltration can be observed in the lamina propria. Acute necrosis of PDCoV-infected enterocytes (Jung et al. 2016a) results in marked villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum, but not duodenum or large intestine, which coincides with fewer PDCoV antigen-positive duodenal, caecal or colonic epithelial cells (Chen et al. 2015; Jung et al. 2015b). Acute-phase viremia with low PDCoV RNA titres in serum is observed (Chen et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2016). After recovery of pigs from clinical disease, huge amount of PDCoV antigens are found in the gut lymphatic tissues (Hu et al. 2016). Additionally, low or moderate quantities of PDCoV RNA, but not antigens, are detected in multiple organs, feasibly as of viremia (Chen et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2015; Jung et al. 2016b). Decreased levels of PDCoV shedding (compared with PEDV and TGEV) in the faeces may be indicative of its incomplete adaptation to pigs and can contribute to its slower spread among swine herds and the lower mortality of nursing pigs (Jung et al. 2015b).",

Since then the disease has been reported in several pig-rearing countries practicing intensive pig farming system, including Europe, Asia (Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan), the Americas (North, Central and South) and Africa (Za\u00efre, Ghana). Despite the widespread application of vaccines, TGEV infections were a prime reason for enteric disease and mortality in piglets in the USA and globally in the 1960s\u20131980s. The presence and extensive prevalence of PRCV, a deletion mutant of TGEV, narrowed the clinical impact of TGE (Laude et al. 1993; Pensaert et al. 1986, 1993; Brown and Cartwright 1986; Pensaert 1989; Yaeger et al. 2002). Currently, sporadic outbreaks of profuse diarrhoea in piglets due to TGEV in TGEV/PRCV seronegative herds are yet to be confirmed in North America, Europe and Asia. However, careful differentiation between TGEV and emerging TGEV/ PEDV recombinants may be needed.",

Note that the historical prevalence of classical PEDV in the European swine population is unknown.

In India, 21.2% of 528 serum samples from pigs (2\u20136 months old) were confirmed positive for PEDV antibodies (Barman et al. 2003).

The S-INDEL PEDV strains were detected in Japanese (Suzuki et al. 2015) and Korean (Lee et al. 2014) farms in 2013 and 2014, respectively. To date, other PEDV variants that carry a large deletion in the NTD of the S protein were detected exclusively in pigs in Japan. Besides the avirulent TTR-2 strain (Suzuki et al. 2016), 15 novel field PEDV mutants with large deletions in the NTD of S gene ranging from 582 to 648 nt were detected from diarrhoeic pig faecal or intestinal samples collected between December 2013 and June 2015 (Diep et al. 2017). Interestingly, all of these samples contained at least two PEDV strains with distinct large genomic deletions, and the majority of these PEDV strains were confirmed to contain an intact S gene. These variants with large deletions in the S gene were found in both primary and recurring PED outbreaks. In summary, classical, emerging non-S INDEL and S-INDEL PEDV strains exist in Asia and Europe, but only emerging non-S INDEL and S-INDEL PEDV strains are currently confirmed to circulate in the Americas. No PEDV infections have been reported in the African and Australian continents so far.",

Among intestinal or faecal samples obtained from diarrhoeic pigs from 5 Ohio farms, 92.9% were found to be positive for PDCoV by RT-PCR (Wang et al. 2014b). The PDCoV sequences shared high nucleotide similarity with the two Chinese prototype PDCoV strains, HKU15-44 and HKU15-155, identified in 2012. Other two genetically similar PDCoV strains, USA/IA/2014/8734 and SDCV/USA/Illinois121/2014, were detected in US states during the same time period (Li et al. 2014; Marthaler et al. 2014a). After this PDCoV has been confirmed in 19 US states (www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/secd) but is still less widespread than PEDV. PDCoV origin in US swine is unknown; however, serologic evidence suggests that it was circulating in US swine before its recognition in 2014 (Sinha et al. 2015; Thachil et al. 2015).",

Intestinal and serum IgA TGEV antibodies and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) have been detected in pigs after oral, but not after parenteral, administration with TGEV (Saif et al. 1994; VanCott et al. 1993, 1994; Kodama et al. 1980). Presence of IgA antibody (likely of intestinal origin) in the serum is considered to be an indicator of active immunity to TGE (Kodama et al. 1980; Saif 1999). Besides local antibody responses, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is also important in protection against TGEV infections (Brim et al. 1995; Frederick et al. 1976; Shimizu and Shimizu 1979). Retinoic acid may enhance CMI after immunisation of piglets with an inactivated TGEV vaccine by increasing the trafficking of CD8+ T cells to lymph nodes and small intestine (Chen et al. 2016b). It was conceived that a low natural killer (NK) cell activity might associate with the higher susceptibility of piglets and parturient sows to TGEV infection (Cepica and Derbyshire 1984). A virulent (SHXB) however not attenuated (STC3) TGEV strain impeded the capacity of porcine intestinal DCs or monocyte-derived DCs to sample antigen, migrate and incite T-cell expansion in vivo and in vitro (Zhao et al. 2014), suggestive of the immune-suppressive potential of TGEV.",

This partial immunity is associated with rapid increases in TGEV-VN antibodies (Cox et al. 1993; Wesley and Woods 1996) and numbers of IgG and IgA ASCs in the intestines (Saif et al. 1994; VanCott et al. 1994). Movement of PRCV IgG and IgA ASCs from the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT) to the gut of the PRCV-exposed pigs after TGEV challenge may clarify the quick anamnestic response and induces the partial protection (VanCott et al. 1994). However, neonatal pigs needed a week after PRCV encounter to develop partial immunity to subsequent TGEV challenge (Wesley and Woods 1996).",

However, TGEV serology is complex, as both TGEV and PRCV prompt VN antibodies that are quantitatively and qualitatively similar (Pensaert 1989). A blocking ELISA that uses MAbs to TGEV differentiates easily from PRCV (Garwes et al. 1988; Bernard et al. 1989; Callebaut et al. 1989). However, blocking ELISA works better on a group basis since certain pigs with low antibody titres to TGEV or PRCV may not show positivity (Callebaut et al. 1989; Sestak et al. 1999b; Simkins et al. 1993). Further, the accuracy of commercial ELISAs for distinguishing US strains of PRCV and TGEV is low (Sestak et al. 1999a).",

Although loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays (Ren and Li 2011; Yu et al. 2015) are recognised more recently as highly sensitive in detecting PEDV RNA, they have still not reached diagnostic labs. In situ hybridisation can be utilised to recognise PEDV RNA in fixed tissues (Stadler et al. 2015).",

Recently, IgG and IgA antibodies to PEDV are observed in oral fluids, suggesting that they may be appropriate to monitor prior herd exposure to PEDV (Bjustrom-Kraft et al. 2016). PEDV antibodies have been demonstrated using indirect ELISAs based on the whole cell-culture-adapted virus antigens (Carvajal et al. 1995; Hofmann and Wyler 1990; Kweon et al. 1994; Thomas et al. 2015), S/N viral proteins extracted from infected Vero cells (Knuchel et al. 1992; Oh et al. 2005) or bacteria or mammalian expression systems (Wang et al. 2015; Gerber et al. 2014; Gerber and Opriessnig 2015; Okda et al. 2015; Paudel et al. 2014). Blocking and competitive ELISAs have additionally been used for the detection of PEDV antibodies utilising MAbs or polyclonal antibodies (Carvajal et al. 1995; Okda et al. 2015; van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra 1991). Serum IgG antibodies against the N proteins of PEDV can be detected by 9\u201314 dpi; they peak around 21 dpi and then decline gradually (Okda et al. 2015). The VN test in Vero cell culture is used to assess VN antibodies to PEDV (Thomas et al. 2015; Okda et al. 2015; Paudel et al. 2014). These serological assays have generally been employed to screen prior exposure to the virus and to assess the viability of vaccines.",

The methodologies discussed for TGEV and PEDV apply to PDCoV diagnosis. The confirmatory finding of PDCoV infection incorporates detection of PDCoV RNA or antigens in the faeces or intestinal substance/tissues. Diagnosis can also be made utilising RT-PCR assays that target a conserved region of PDCoV M or N genes (Marthaler et al. 2014b; Wang et al. 2014c), IF or IHC using virus-specific MAbs or polyclonal antibodies (Chen et al. 2015; Jung et al. 2015b; Ma et al. 2015), and in situ hybridisation (Jung et al. 2015b). A duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of PDCoV and/or differentiation from PEDV in intestines and faeces was developed (Zhang et al. 2016b).",

Three potential reservoirs for TGEV between seasonal epidemics proposed are (1) herds with enzootic TGE; (2) hosts other than swine and (3) carrier pigs. Dogs, cats and foxes could be the possible carriers, facilitating its spread on farms, as the shedding of the virus occurs for variable periods (Haelterman 1962; McClurkin et al. 1970) with the excreted virus (by dogs) remaining infectious for pigs (Haelterman 1962; Reynolds et al. 1980).",

Likewise, housefly (Musca domestica) is also proposed as a mechanical vector for TGEV (Pilchard 1965). TGEV antigen is seen in flies on a swine herd and TGEV shedding up to 3 days from experimentally feeding flies (Gough and Jorgenson 1983). Notably, surveys done in Central Europe confirmed the presence of TGEV antibodies in nearly 30% of the feral pigs (Sedlak et al. 2008). Although TGEV shedding is detectable for up to 104 dpi (Underdahl et al. 1975), it is undefined yet whether infectious virus particles are shed or transmitted at that time. Adding of sentinel pigs to a herd at 3, 4 and 5 months after a past TGE outbreak resulted in no new disease in the introduced pigs (Derbyshire et al. 1969).",

To note, intramuscular, parenteral or intra-mammary administration of pregnant sows with live attenuated, inactivated or subunit vaccines did not offer complete protection but were found to be effective to reduce piglet mortality rates (Brim et al. 1994). Unlike natural intestinal infection with the virulent virus, attenuated viruses do not stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis sufficiently for the induction of immunity similar to that observed following this. There are two commercial vaccines based on a live-modified TGEV strain for combined oral-intramuscular administration produced by Merck Animal Health: PROSYSTEM\u00ae TGE/Rota and PROSYSTEM\u00ae TREC.

This practice is called feedback and results in the rapid development of immunity in pregnant sows (particularly in those due to farrow 2 weeks or more after the start of the outbreak) and reduces losses in newborn piglets. However, it may also result in dissemination of other pathogens (potentially present in TGEV-containing faeces/intestinal contents) to adjacent herds. On small-scale farms, herd immunity is accomplished, and TGEV infection is self-limiting. In contrast, in larger farms (\u2264200 sows) with a continuous farrowing system and continual influx of susceptible animals, TGEV infection frequently becomes endemic after the primary outbreak (Saif and Sestak 2006). Elimination of endemic TGE in a herd can be attempted using the feedback method. After this is done, no weaning of piglets should occur during the following 3\u20134 weeks so that there remains no susceptible host in the herd while TGEV is circulating on the farm.",

In China, the CV777-based inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines were approved in 1995 and 1998, respectively (Wang et al. 2016b). Soon after, attenuated vaccines based on classical PEDV strains KPEDV-9 and DR13 were commercialised in 1999 and 2004, respectively, in Korea (Kweon et al. 1999; Song et al. 2007). Since 1997 a commercial attenuated PEDV vaccine based on cell culture-adapted classical PEDV P-5V strain (Nisseiken Co. Ltd., Japan) is administered to sows in Japan (Sato et al. 2011). These vaccines based on classical PEDV strains appeared to satisfactorily control PED in Asia until the highly virulent non-S INDEL PEDV strains have emerged (Lee 2015). As demonstrated in the field, the classical PEDV vaccines have failed to protect pigs from severe diarrhoeal disease associated with the emerging highly virulent non-S INDEL PEDV strains (Lee 2015).",

The first vaccine was developed in June 2014 using a replication-deficient Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus packaging system expressing the S protein of an emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain (Crawford et al. 2016). The second vaccine developed in September 2015 was an inactivated whole-virus (non-S INDEL PEDV) vaccine plus an adjuvant (Crawford et al. 2016). In October 2016, an inactivated vaccine based on non-S INDEL PEDV strain AJ1102 was licensed in China (Wang et al. 2016b). In South Korea, an inactivated vaccine candidate based on non-S INDEL strain KNU-141112 was demonstrated to be protective in sows and their suckling piglets (Baek et al. 2016). However, the efficacy of these vaccines/vaccine candidates in the field is not assessed. To date, reverse genetics platforms have been generated for both classical and emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains using different approaches (Beall et al. 2016; Jengarn et al. 2015; Li et al. 2013) and can be used for the future rational design of safe and effective PEDV vaccines.",

In the absence of any suitable vaccines or antivirals to control PDCoV disease, reliable regime includes symptomatic action giving bicarbonate liquids and ad lib water to alleviate acidosis and dehydration in suckling pigs. Antibiotics administration may be beneficial in the case complicated by concurrent/secondary bacterial infection. In the event of heavy mortality, feedback techniques must be opted to stimulate lactogenic immunity and reduce mortality. Additionally, during PDCoV epidemics, a strict biosecurity plan must be implemented to lessen PDCoV spread via infected fomites. The systems all in/all out and thorough disinfection (using phenolic disinfectants, bleach, peroxides, aldehydes or iodophors) can break the disease cycle.",
