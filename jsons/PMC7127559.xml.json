Particularly, as an chemical-free biomacromolecule, natural rubber latex (NRL) has been used in manufacturing medical products such as medical gloves, condoms, blood transfusion tubing, catheters, injector closures and safety bags due to its excellent elasticity, flexibility, anti-virus permeation, good formability and biodegradability [4], [5], [6]. More recently, with the worldwide spread of the epidemic diseases such as acquired immure deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis B, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A (H5N1), it becomes increasingly important and urgent to develop high performance NRL protective products.",

Though various anti-ageing agents have been successfully developed for dry NR products and limited anti-ageing agents for NRL were reported by using tris (nonylated phenyl) phosphite [7] and non-water-soluble amino acids [8], no ideal anti-ageing agents have been identified so far for medical NRL products where strict safety and hygiene are required.",

Such an improvement in combined characteristics is particularly significant at low loading levels of nano-fillers, which do not significantly increase the density of the compound or reduce light transmission. Therefore, introduction of inorganic nano-fillers into NR matrixes to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of NR has recently attracted enormous interest. Most of these are using clay minerals with a unique multi-layered structure to reinforce NR via melt-intercalation [14], [15], latex-compounding [16] and solution-mixing methods [17]. It was found that the organically modified clays with a loading up to 10 wt% have a good reinforcement on the NR matrix due to the intercalation/exfoliation of silicates and formation of a skeleton silicate network in NR matrix [15], [16]. Nair et al. [18], [19], [20] also used nano crab chitin whiskers to reinforce NR. It was found that there is a three-dimensional chitin network within the NR matrix, which results in significantly improved solvent resistance and mechanical properties.",

The improvement in the properties is largely due to the uniform distribution of SiO2 nanoparticles and the strong interactions between SiO2 and polymer matrixes.

However, due to a large difference in rigidity between SiO2 and PDDA and the charge density of PDDA is significantly larger than that on SiO2, all of the former charges cannot form short-distance ion pairs with surface charges of rigid SiO2 particles [30]. Therefore, the positive charge on PDDA cannot completely neutralized by the negative charge on SiO2 particles during the assembly, and the SiO2/PDDA core-shell particles will appear positive and be ready for next assembly with negatively charged NRL particles. To avoid the flocculation of NRL caused by the introduction of high molecular weight water-soluble cationic polyelectrolytes, PDDA that is not effectively assembled with SiO2 is removed by the rinse presented in experimental section.",

If the pH is lower than the isoelectric point of NRL (4.5\u20135.0), basic ionization will occur and NRL particles will be positively charged. Under isoelectric condition, NRL particles will remain neutral. As the pH used in the experiment (pH 10) is higher than the isoelectric point, acidic ionization is generated.

These primary aggregations are unlikely caused by the strong particle\u2013particle interaction, but the adsorption between polymer molecular chain and SiO2 nanoparticles, i.e. PDDA molecular chains adsorb quite a few separate nanoparticles to form nano-clusters in the stage of assembly. Therefore, the SiO2 is not distributed in NR matrix as individual nanoparticles, but as nano-clusters. Similar assumption was found in polyethylene oxide (PEO)/silica nanocomposites. Gunb\u2019ko et al. [31] reported that each PEO molecules could interact with many primary fumed SiO2 particles to form small aggregates.

A similar result was also found in PVA/SiO2 nanocomposites where both primary and secondary aggregations were observed at a SiO2 content higher than 5 wt% [21], [23]. However, without further information, we could not explain how and why the strong aggregation starts from this critical level.

As more SiO2 is added, the size distribution becomes significantly broader. Similarly, the average diameter of the SiO2 clusters is quite stable (<85 nm) as SiO2 is less than 4.0 wt%, it then markedly increases with the further addition of SiO2. Fumed silica nanoparticles have been extensively used to prepare polymer/silica nanocomposites via melt compounding [32] and other physical blending [33]. However, silica has a number of hydroxyl groups on the surface, which results in the strong filler\u2013filler or particle\u2013particle interactions, and therefore has strong self-aggregation nature. In such conditions, the fumed SiO2 nanoparticles tend to form loosely agglomerates that are dispersed with an average size in the range 300\u2013400 nm, and these aggregated particles cannot be broken down by the shear forces during melt compounding [32]. Compared to other physical blending process, the process in the current work possesses significant advantages, as the size of SiO2 is only around 85 nm.",

When SiO2 is introduced into NR matrix, the main decomposition peak shifts to a higher temperature and is gradually divided into two peaks.

Therefore, the diffusion of decomposition products from the bulk polymer to gas phase is slowed down. Consequently, the nanocomposite has a more complex decomposition and a pronounced improvement of ageing resistance compared to the pure NR.

The elongation is just focused on 100%, 200% and 300%, as the filler\u2013polymer interactions play a critical role at a low elongation, while at a high elongation the strain-reduced crystallisation of NR dominates the elongation [15].
