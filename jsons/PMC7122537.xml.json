SiaAc is expressed in cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific manners, and is involved in various biological phenomena, such as immune reactions, virus-cell adhesion, malignancy, and others [1, 10]. Sialate:O-acetyl-transferases [1, 11] and sialate:O-acetyl-esterases [12\u201314] are important enzymes for acetylation and deacetylation of Sia. The importance of 9-O-acetylated Sia during early development was evidenced by the transgenic expression of Influenza C hemagglutinin esterase in mice, leading to mice deficient in 9-O-acetylated Sia [4]. Recent analyses on sialate:O-acetyl-esterase deficient mice showed impairment of B cell-related functions that could be related to the inhibitory activity of siglec-2 ([5]; siglecs are discussed by Schwardt et al. [15]).",

Due to a genetic defect in CMAH, humans do not express a functional CMAH and thus do not endogenously produce Neu5Gc. However, Neu5Gc can be metabolically incorporated from dietary sources (particularly red meat and milk) into glycoproteins and glycolipids. Human fetuses, tumors, and some normal tissues were shown by mass spectrometry to incorporate Neu5Gc. Moreover, Neu5Gc has been demonstrated to be metabolically incorporated and covalently expressed on cultured human cell surfaces. Metabolically incorporated Neu5Gc is immunogenic in humans [18], and the presence of human anti-Neu5Gc antibodies has been associated with tumor progression [19] and vascular inflammation [20].

            "text": "Kdn contains a hydroxyl group at the C-5 position, instead of the acetamide-group in Neu5Ac (Fig. 1). Kdn was discovered in glycoproteins from rainbow trout eggs [22, 23]. In mammalian tissues, Kdn occurs at a very low level and amounts to <1% of total Sia. However, expression of Kdn increases in certain ovarian cancers, and the amount is proportional to the degree of malignancy [24]. Under hypoxic conditions free Kdn increases in mammalian tumor cells. As hypoxia-resistance is a frequent property found in tumors, it is likely that Kdn supports this state of mammalian cells [25]. In rat liver, cytosolic Kdn increases in an age-dependent manner. The level of free Kdn was reported to be high in erythrocytes of the umbilical vein. These findings demonstrate that attention has to be paid to the physiological significance of Kdn in malignancy and in aging [23]. Of interest in this context, Kdn residues, in contrast to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, are resistant to known bacterial and mammalian sialidases [22, 23]. In salmonid fish, Kdn caps polySia chains in egg polysialoglycoproteins, thus stopping chain elongation and possibly protecting polySia from bacterial sialidase attacks [22, 23]. Biological roles of Kdn in mammals remain to be elucidated, but increase of the Kdn level in cells and tissues may be a biomarker for some cancers and in aging cells.",

Methods for the detection of SiaS are not so well developed, and occurrence of SiaS has been only demonstrated in a limited number of animal species so far [26\u201334]. In sea urchin, 8-O-sulfated Neu5Ac (Neu5Ac8S) and Neu5Gc8S are present in glycolipids [27\u201329], in glycoproteins from the vitelline layer polysialylated glycoprotein [30], and in the sperm flagellar glycoprotein, flagellasialin [31, 32]. In mammals, Neu5Ac8S and Neu5Gc8S residues are found in gangliosides from bovine gastric mucosa [33, 34], and Neu5Ac8S was detected in tissues from human, rat, and mouse [35, 36]. The glycoconjugates carrying SiaS in mammals have remained undetermined with the exception of the bovine gastric gangliosides [33, 34]. Similarly, the biological significance of the SiaS in animal tissues is not known. It is interesting, however, that chemically synthesized SiaS-containing compounds have been applied as artificial inhibitors for fertilization [37] and bacterial infections [38], irrespective of the very limited knowledge on the natural occurrence of SiaS. These facts point to the potential importance of the SiaS residues in various biologic processes.",

In two cases Sia has been identified as an internal sugar between neutral sugars: Fuc\u03b11\u2192O\nglycolylNeu5Gc\u03b12-4Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Glc1- in echinoderms [39] and a polymer of \u21924Neu5Ac\u03b12\u21926Glc/Gal1 disaccharide in the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups Y and W-135, respectively [40]. Moreover, Sias can be linked to each other to form diSia, oligoSia, and polySia (by definition DP > 8 is termed polySia). First identified in the glycocalyx of neuroinvasive bacteria, polySia has so far been demonstrated to be a posttranslational modification on six glycoproteins, the fish egg polysialoglycoprotein (PSGP), the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a voltage-gated sodium channel in eel, CD36 in human milk, NRP2 in human lymphocytes, and SynCAM-1 in mouse brain (for recent reviews see [41\u201343]). Polysialylation occurs in some tumors (probably on NCAM) and is involved in metastasis. By virtue of its net negative charge at physiological pH and exclusive volume, polySia serves as a mediator of ligand\u2013receptor and cell\u2013cell interactions via an anti-adhesive effect [44]. In addition, polySia has been demonstrated to function as a reservoir molecule for BDNF, dopamine, and FGF-2 [41, 43, 45\u201349] and to be involved in the regulation of ion transport via interactions with channels [32, 50\u201352]. Compared to what is known about polySia, the information on oligoSia is limited [43, 53, 54]. DiSia and oligoSia are common glyco-epitopes between glycolipids and glycoproteins. The functions of diSia on the glycolipids (GD3 and GT1b) have been well studied, while far less knowledge about the functions of diSia and oligoSia on the glycoproteins has been reported [55\u201357]. Interestingly, oligoSia and polySia with the degree of polymerization up to 16 have been recently found in glycolipids of sea urchin sperm [58], although their functions remain to be elucidated.",

One is a hydrolysis, 0.1 N trifluoroacetic acid at 80\u00b0C for 2 h to release free Sia from sialoglycoconjugates at step 1. The second is the DMB labeling which takes place in 0.01 N trifluoroacetic acid at 50\u00b0C for 3 h (step 2). Attention must therefore be given to the acid lability of some Sia substituents. No significant degradation of Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn has been reported. For SiaS, the glycosidic bonds of SiaS were completely hydrolyzed under the hydrolysis conditions, while their sulfate esters are hydrolyzed by, at most, 4% [64]. No apparent desulfation occurred under the labeling conditions. The O-acetyl groups on Sia are very labile to basic conditions and more stable under acidic conditions. Although no quantitative data are available for the lability of O-acetyl group during the DMB-derivatization procedures, quantitative analysis is basically possible as long as authentic O-acetylated Sia compounds are used as a standard. It is of interest to note that the 8-O-acetyl ester is more labile than a 9-O-acetyl ester, and acetyl-groups tend to migrate to the C-9 position at the end, even under neutral conditions at room temperature [65]. However, no such migration takes place with the 8-O-sulfate ester of Sia.",

The O-acetylated Sia are eluted more slowly than the corresponding non-O-acetylated Sia. To separate the various SiaS from each other, an acidic solution of acetonitrile/methanol/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (9:7:84 by volume) [64] is recommended. This solution will enable the separation of DMB derivatives of Neu5Ac8S, Neu5Ac9S, Neu5Gc8S, and Neu5Gc9S. For the separation of DMB derivatives of Kdn8S and Kdn9S, a solution with higher polarity, acetonitrile/methanol/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (4:6:90 by volume), is appropriate [64]. The described protocol enabled the separation of DMB derivatives of nine different sulfated and non-sulfated Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn (Fig. 2). The relative peak area represents the proportion of the peak area of each DMB-Sia to that of DMB-Neu5Ac, and can be used as an index for relative detection efficiency.

To release di-, oligo-, and polySia, 20 \u03bcL of 0.01 N TFA and 20 \u03bcL of 7 mM DMB solution in 5.0 mM TFA containing 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 18 mM sodium hydrosulfite, are added to the samples These samples are incubated at 50\u00b0C for 1\u20132 h or at 4\u00b0C overnight. The DMB-labeled samples are applied to an HPLC analysis. HPLC equipped with a Mono or Mini Q HR5/5 (0.5 \u00d7 5 cm, GE, Uppsala, Sweden), Resource Q (1 mL, GE, Uppsala, Sweden), CarbopacPA-100, or DNApak1 PA-120 (4 \u00d7 250 mm, Dionex) anion exchange column, and a fluorescence detector (FP-2025, JASCO). After equilibrating the column with 5 mM to 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 26\u00b0C, samples are applied and the DMB-labeled di-, oligo-, and polySia are eluted at a flow rate of 0.5\u20131.0 mL/min with a linear gradient of NaCl (0\u21920.4 M) after 15\u201330 min wash with 5\u201320 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (flow through). The fluorescence of the DMB-labeled samples is detected with a fluorescence detector at excitation 373 nm and emission 448 nm. The separation is dependent on the anion exchange column and buffer conditions. Mono Q and Resource Q are suitable for shorter oligo- and polymers. Mini Q and Carbopac PA-100 have almost the same ability to separate polymers with DPs ranging from 2 to DP 50\u201390 (Fig. 3). Additionally, this method can be applied to determine the glycosidic linkage (\u03b12\u21928, \u03b12\u21929, and \u03b12\u21925) of diSia units (Neu5Ac\u2192Neu5Ac, Neu5Ac\u2192Neu5Gc, Neu5Gc\u2192Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc\u2192Neu5Gc, Kdn\u2192Kdn, and so on) and their component Sia species [70] according to their elution time. If the sample is pure sialyloligo or -polymer, it can be detected on a UV detector or a pulse amperometric detector (PAD) [71], instead of the DMB-derivatization/fluorometric detection method.\n",

Second, the C9-derivatives formed do not always arise from \u03b12\u21928-linkages, because 8-O-substituted Neu5Acyl residues may also give the same C9-derivatives. Therefore, mild alkali treatment of samples is usually carried out prior to periodate oxidation. Third, the molar proportion of C9-derivatives to C7-derivatives does not directly represent the DP unless it is a linear polySia chain. Thus, the method does not yield the DP for multiply sialylated chains present in the same sample. In general, glycoproteins have more than one glycan chain and even one glycan chain bears two to four non-reducing terminal residues that may be terminated by monoSia or oligoSia residues.",

Group I consists of the \u201canti-polySia antibodies\u201d that recognize chains of \u03b12\u21928-linked Sia with a DP \u2265 8, including fully extended polySia chains with a DP ~ 200\u2013400. These antibodies recognize the helical conformation formed by Sia residues within the internal region of the polySia chains, but not the non-reducing terminal residues. Group II antibodies, designated as \u201canti-oligo + polySia antibodies,\u201d recognize both oligoSia with DP 2\u20137 and polySia chains. These antibodies recognize the distal portion of oligo/polySia chains, including the non-reducing termini. Group III antibodies, designated as \u201canti-oligoSia antibodies,\u201d recognize specific conformations of di- and oligoSia with a DP 2\u20134, but do not bind polySia. Group III antibodies can be further classified into two subgroups. One group is composed of \u201canti-diSia antibodies\u201d that recognize the diNeu5Ac structure (S2-566, 1E6), and the other includes the \u201canti-oligoSia antibodies\u201d (AC1). Group II and III antibodies would be useful for detecting and determining di- and oligoSia structures, in combination with treatment with exo- and endo-sialidases, as described below (Table 3). The antibodies can be applied to Western blotting (Fig. 5a), immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5b), and FACS analysis (Fig. 5c) [86].\n\n",

[88]) can serve as a specific molecular probe to detect and selectively modify \u03b12\u21928-linked polySia chains. The soluble enzyme derived from bacteriophage K1F, designated endoN, catalyzes the depolymerization of polySia chains as follows: (\u21928Neu5Acyl\u03b12\u2192)n\u2212X (n \u2265 5) \u2192 (\u21928Neu5Acyl\u03b12\u2192)2\u22124 + (\u21928Neu5Acyl\u03b12\u2192)2\u2212X. Two other types of endo-sialidases whose substrate specificities are different from the endoN of bacteriophage K1F [89] have been isolated: endoNE [90] and an endosialidase [91] from a bacteriophage. The minimum chain length required for cleavage is DP \u2265 11 and DP \u2265 3, respectively. Exo-sialidases have been isolated that cleave specific linkages, for example, \u03b12,3-sialidase (NANase I), \u03b12,3-, \u03b12,6-sialidase (NANase II), \u03b12,3-, \u03b12,6-, \u03b12,8-sialidase (NANase III), and \u03b12,3-, \u03b12,6-, \u03b12,8-, and \u03b12,9-sialidase. As the endoN is insensitive toward di- and oligoSia structures and they should be cleavable by these exosialidases, it is possible to confirm the length of given di-, oligo-, and polySia chains in conjunction with endo- and exo-sialidase treatments before and after immunostaining with anti-diSia, oligoSia, and polySia antibodies (See Table 3) [43, 53, 54].",

Direct demonstration of the presence of 9-O-acetylated Sias in mammalian tissues was indirect (modifications of the PAS technique) until the development of a chimeric dual-functional probe derived from influenza-C hemagglutinin esterase (InfCHE). This probe was constructed using a soluble and versatile form of the InfCHE that retains both the hemagglutinin and esterase activity and also has the binding properties of IgG Fc. The esterase activity is very similar to that of the native protein, and pH conditions can be adjusted to remove either 9-O-acetyl groups alone or both 9- and 7-O-acetyl groups completely (by causing migration of the latter to the 9-carbon position). DFP (di-isopropyl fluorophosphates) inactivation stabilizes and \u201cunmasks\u201d the hemagglutinin activity, resulting in a probe that specifically detects 9-O-acetylated sialic acids at ambient temperatures. Since CHE-FcD and CHE-Fc differ only by a single di-isopropyl group, each can be used as control for the other. Thus, when the CHE-Fc is used to remove 9-O-acetyl esters, the CHE-FcD can be used as an inactive control. Conversely, when CHE-FcD is used to probe for 9-O-acetylated Sias, the CHE-Fc can be used as a control for nonspecific binding. The two forms can even be used sequentially; i.e., treatment with CHE-Fc can be used to remove the 9-O-acetyl esters prior to probing with CHE-FcD, leaving only nonspecific staining, if any. It should be noted that the CHE-Fc does have a masked hemagglutinin activity, which can give a weak positive response at low temperatures, and even at ambient temperatures if the density of O-acetylated Sias is very high [6, 100\u2013105].",

            "text": "Structural diversity of Sia is not so large in each animal compared with that which we know in nature. In humans, Neu5Ac is a dominant Sia species, with NeuGc and Kdn contributing to only small amounts. 9-O-Acetylated Neu5Ac is a major modified Sia, but is still a minor form of total Neu5Ac in human. In rainbow trout, on the other hand, Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn appear to be equally expressed, although in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, which Sia species each animal expresses for particular biological roles depends on the animal species. Evolutional pressures for the selection of Sia species may come from critical interactions for survival of life, such as pathogen\u2013host interactions, and species-specific sperm\u2013egg interactions in fertilization. Thus, in some cases, a particular Sia species is specifically functional; in other cases, no specific Sia is necessary. The presence of Kdn-specific sialidase in bacteria, the preferential recognition of Neu5Gc by mouse siglec-2, and an inhibitory effect of polySia, but not di- and oligoSia, on homophilic binding of NCAM may exemplify the significance of the structural diversity of Sia species. Importantly, modifications of Sia are often changed dynamically, including the O-acetylation/de-O-acetylation cycle and transient degradation of polySia to oligoSia. However, currently there is very little knowledge available about the enzymes involved in these modification/re-modification reactions. Future studies will be directed toward this identification of Sia-modification enzymes and their genes.",
