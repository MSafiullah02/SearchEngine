In these children, airway obstruction is documented by classical signs (cough, decreased air entry, wheezing), symptoms (cough, wheezing, dyspnoea, expectorations), accessory muscle use and impaired air exchange parameters. Reversibility is reflected by the improvement following bronchodilator and/or corticosteroids; and hyper-reactivity is supported by deterioration upon exposure to specific triggers.8\n;\n9 Children meeting these criteria can be diagnosed with asthma at the very first episode, thus avoiding unnecessary delays in treatment.",

The PEAK trial involved 285 children aged 2 to 3 years with a high risk of asthma, that is, with four episodes or more in the prior year, and either one major risk factor (parental history of asthma or personal history of atopic dermatitis) or two of three minor risk factors (allergic rhinitis, eosinophilia, and wheezing without colds). More than 57% of enrolled children had positive aeroallergen skin tests, suggesting allergic or multi-trigger asthma in the majority of children.18 Low dose daily fluticasone for two years was associated with a significant reduction in episode-free days, rescue bronchodilator use, and exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids and significantly improved lung function over placebo. The efficacy of daily maintenance inhaled corticosteroids to improve symptoms and prevent exacerbations in patients of all ages with multi-trigger asthma is clearly established.",

Of interest, in 549 children aged 2 to 5 years with viral-induced asthma, but including children with symptoms between exacerbations, daily montelukast did not show any group difference in rescue oral corticosteroids it appeared more effective than placebo for reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations.20 As the latter study included children with interim symptoms between episodes, it is unclear whether the observed benefits primarily apply to children with multi-trigger or those with viral-induced asthma.",

Moreover, in a large placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of 700 children aged 10-60 months with mild-to-moderate viral-induced wheezing, oral corticosteroid was not superior to placebo for reducing the length of stay in hospital or improving the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure clinical score, despite adequate power.2 Critics have suggested that the absence of responsiveness to oral corticosteroids may due to: (1) a large proportion of children with bronchiolitis (with asthma documented in only 16% of children); (2) mild disease severity not requring corticosteroids; (3) insufficient corticosteroids dosage (1 mg/kg of prednisolone) and (4) the prolonged stay in hospital perhaps not supported by severity.13 Yet, this study elicited a major discomfort regarding acute asthma management in young children, raising the possibility that preschool-age and/or viral triggers may be responsible for the poor apparent responsiveness.",

In fact, in a subgroup analysis, preschoolers treated with prednisolone paradoxically experienced a higher rate of unscheduled medical visits compared to those receiving placebo. Although preschool age and perhaps viral trigger may again be cited as causal, the following hypotheses were also raised to explain the lack of efficacy of parent-initiated treatment in view of the efficacy of physician-initiated oral corticosteroids: (1) the lower severity of exacerbations managed at home compared to those leading to a physician visit and (2) the difficulty for parents of making an accurate assessment of severity and need for oral corticosteroid treatment in their child.",

In a study of children aged 3-36 months, those infected with rhinovirus showed fewer relapses when treated with oral prednisone compared to placebo, suggesting that rhinovirus did not impair responsiveness to corticosteroids.36 In a placebo-controlled trial of 283 young children with wheezing, prednisolone did not significantly decrease the overall time to discharge; however, it reduced by half the length of stay in children infected with picornavirus and by fourfold that of children with enterovirus, suggesting that response may be organism-dependant.37 Clearly, oral corticosteroids may not be as effective in patients with viral infections as in those without, perhaps due to neutrophilic airway inflammation, a condition associated with poor response to corticosteroids.

In paediatrics, exposure to tobacco smoke has been associated with a higher incidence of URTIs and prevalence of asthma, and a greater severity of exacerbations.40 However, the impact on the therapeutic response has not been documented in children, as asthma trials have not examined or failed to report subgroup analyses on environmental tobacco smoke exposure or active smoking. Yet, heavier environmental tobacco smoke exposure in preschoolers who spend more time at home than school-aged children41 may explain a poorer response in young children.

Two major groups of genes are of interest: (1) those affecting susceptibility to asthma and specific phenotypes and (2) those directly interfering with response to corticosteroids by coding for major components of the pathway involved in corticosteroid action (Table 1\n). In the first group, 8 key polymorphisms in 7 genes have been identified; they can be divided into those coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and those coding for mediators of inflammation and immunity, specifically the ones demonstrated to affect lung function, disease severity and interaction with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.43 The selected polymorphisms affect gene function with top-ranking single nucleotide polymorphisms in a number of association studies. TGFB1 polymorphisms were found to correlate with disease severity;44\nCC16 polymorphisms play a role in the development and persistence of the asthma phenotype in childhood;45\nCD14 polymorphisms have been linked to pathogenesis of asthma and lung function in smokers.46 The ORMDL3 gene confers susceptibility to early-onset asthma, particularly through interaction with early life exposure to environmental tobacco smoke;43, 47\nGSTM1 null and GSTP1 genotypes have been associated with an increased risk of asthma48 and rapid decline of lung function among smokers.49 The ADRB2 receptor gene was found to contribute to the occurrence of wheeze among children who were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero and early childhood.50\n",

There is increasing evidence that, in contrast to those with allergic or multi-trigger asthma, preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma may display a certain degree of corticosteroid resistance, requiring higher doses of corticosteroids to overcome it. Other than design and confounding issues including mixed diagnoses, heterogeneous phenotypes and mild severity, other determinants of responsiveness may include age, trigger, tobacco smoke exposure, and genetic make-up. The mechanistic pathway for \u201ccorticoresistance\u201d may originate from an interaction between genetic and environment, leading to non-eosinophilic or mixed eosinophilic/neutrophilic inflammation. Maintenance low-dose inhaled corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of the management of multi-trigger asthma of any age, while they show no evidence of effectiveness in children with viral-induced asthma. If a trial of daily montelukast is insufficient to control episodes, episodic high-dose inhaled corticosteroids with careful monitoring of medication use and growth may be considered for viral-induced asthma. Phenotype-specific treatment of children with asthma should be the focus of future research endeavours.",
