Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LPV/RTV (400 mg/100 mg) twice a day in addition to standard care (n = 99) or standard care alone (n = 100) for 14 days. The result showed no difference in clinical improvement between the two groups (hazard ratio = 1.24, 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was also similar in both groups (19.2% vs 25.0%, 95% CI, \u201317.3 to 5.7).

RDV is an adenosine nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which acts as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps).8 RDV inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription and has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads in mice infected with MERS-CoV.9 A recent in vitro study indicated that RDV potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 = 0.77 \u03bcM) in Vero E6 cells.10 A single case report by Holshue et al11 described clinical improvement after RDV used to treat the first US case of COVID-19. There are several randomized control trials currently being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19. Two phase III trials initiated in China in February 2020, aimed to evaluate RDV in hospitalized adult patients with mild/moderate (NCT04252664) or severe (NCT04257656) COVID-19 (RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days vs placebo). Preliminary results of these trials are expected to be announced at the end of April 2020. Thereafter, three international phase III trials were launched in the USA and Asia, including hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 (RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily up to a 10 days course vs placebo; NCT04280705), patients with moderate COVID-19 (RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 4 days vs RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days; NCT04292730), and patients with severe COVID-19 (RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 4 days vs RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days; NCT04292899). Two of these trials are estimated to complete in May 2020.",

These two drugs are weak diprotic bases and can elevate the pH of the endosome, which prevents viral fusion into the cell.14 Recent in vitro studies reported CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with EC50 = 2.71 and 4.51 \u03bcM in Vero E6 cells, respectively.15 Several clinical trials are being conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19, one of which revealed that chloroquine is superior to the control group in clinical improvement, promoting virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course.16 Meanwhile, the preliminary study in France evaluated the efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 patients. There were two groups in this study, 26 patients received HCQ (200 mg tid for 10 days) and 16 patients received standard of care. Six HCQ group patients lost to follow up due to early cessation of treatment. Six patients in HCQ group received additional azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, 250 mg once daily for 4 days) to prevent bacterial superinfection. The result showed the virologically cured rate was significantly higher in HCQ combined with azithromycin-treated patients compared with the HCQ only group or control group (100% vs 57.1% vs 12.5%, p = 0.001).17 Although this study demonstrated promising results, further larger trials are still needed to verify the efficacy and safety of HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19. In addition, HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis/preemptive therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection is now under evaluation in the USA (NCT04308668), using the regimen of 800 mg orally once, followed in 6 to 8 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg once a day for four consecutive days.

Measures to stop the pandemic through discovering and identifying effective treatment or prophylactic agents are crucial. To date, several agents have demonstrated with some efficacy to COVID-19 in humans, but mostly through case reports or preliminary data from clinical trials with small sample sizes. Many ongoing randomized controlled trials are currently being conducted to further confirm these results. With the joint effort of the healthcare professionals and the scientific community worldwide, new evidence for managing COVID-19 is expected to be revealed shortly. Although the potential treatment agents discussed here may provide clinical benefits, it should also be noted that each of the medications may lead to substantial side effects. Healthcare professionals should take great caution during practice.",
