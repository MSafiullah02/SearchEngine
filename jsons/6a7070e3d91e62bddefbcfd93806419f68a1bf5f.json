            "text": "Abstract: Records of disease outbreaks resembling influenza date to the writings of Hippocrates (fifth century BPE). Since then, influenza has afflicted humans around the globe. The most severe (''Spanish Flu'' > pandemic) of three major outbreaks of the twentieth century killed approximately 20-50 million people worldwide. More recently, the global spread of highly pathogenic bird-adapted strain H5N1 is considered a significant pandemic threat. Since 2003, a total of 379 cases and 239 deaths have been reported. This chapter provides an overview of the genetic characteristics of the virus that elucidate its ability to continuously evade a host's immune system; it describes some of the approaches used to quantify the burden of influenza and discusses their implications for the prevention and containment of future pandemics. The preliminary findings of the studies discussed here suggest that influenza-related burden is highly underestimated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This implicates that proper assessment of influenza-related morbidity and mortality worldwide is essential in planning and allocating resources to protect against what could be one of mankind's most devastating challenges. A summary of learned lessons from past influenza pandemics are described and new intervention strategies aim at curtailing a future pandemic are discussed. More importantly, however, is the discussion of today's challenges such as antiviral resistance, limited resources in a world that is globally connected and the imminent gap between the capacity (resources available) of developed and developing parts of the world to respond to a pandemic.",

            "text": "Epidemics caused by influenza viruses occur every winter in temperate regions of the globe. The size of these epidemics varies from year to year and from place to place. Very large epidemics associated with the widespread circulation of genetically novel influenza viruses, socalled pandemics, are caused only by influenza viruses of a single type (type A). Influenza (flu) virus, a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae is a segmented single-stranded RNA virus which exists in three types, A, B and C. Only types A and B cause disease of any consequence in humans. The genomes of both A and B viruses are comprised of eight gene segments which code for eleven viral proteins. Ten of these are functionally similar. The NB protein is unique to B viruses and the recently discovered PB1-F2 protein is found only in A viruses (Chen et al., 2001; McCullers et al., 2004; Steinhauer and Skehel, 2002) . Two of these proteins, hemaglutinnin (HA) coded for by the gene segment conventionally labeled #4, and neuraminidase (NA), coded for by the segment labeled #6, appear on the surface of the influenza virion, and are responsible for the greater portion of the immune response in humans. All B-type influenza viruses share variants of the same HA and NA proteins. The > clinical attack rates for A and B type viruses are similar in children (McCullers et al., 2004) ; but the overall clinical attack rate is much lower in epidemics of B-type than A-type viruses. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that mortality associated with influenza B epidemics has declined about linearly over the most recent 40 years (Reichert et al., 2007) . This difference in epidemiology suggests that the circulation of influenza B viruses in human populations is determined by population-based immunity. Reassortment( > genetic reassortment) among human influenza B viruses is believed to be the genetic basis for sporadic increases in observed attack rates for B-viruses (McCullers et al., 2004) . A-type viruses, however, exhibit another dimension of genetic complexity. A-type viruses circulate not only in humans but in many non-human reservoirs, most notably aquatic birds. The sudden appearance in A-type viruses responsible for human influenza infections of one or more gene segments from influenza viruses that previously circulated only in non-human reservoirs produces chimeric influenza viruses that are sufficiently immunologically novel that very widespread illness and injury occurs among humans. It is also possible that a virus that previously circulated only in a non-human reservoir could mutate sufficiently that it becomes de novo capable both of producing disease in humans and being widely transmissible among humans. Such a virus is maximally different from previous human immunological experience (all gene segments are novel) and potentially could produce the most severe pandemics. Those newly emergent viruses whose genomes are comprised of a substitution of only some of the gene segments of viruses that previously circulated in humans are thought to have arisen via reassortment during dual infections involving both a non-human and human influenza virus. The appearance of an influenza virus with a substituted gene segment is called > ''antigenic shift'' (Hall et al., 1973; Monto and Kioumehr, 1975; Reichert et al., 2007) .",

Only three HA subtypes and two versions of NA have been found in viruses that have circulated widely in humans. Pandemics of the twentieth century and their dates of emergence in the northern/southern hemispheres were caused by viruses of type H1N1 (1918/1918), H2N2 (1957/1958), and H3N2 (1968/1969) . The 1918-1919 pandemic virus emerged en bloc as an avian virus the mutation and adaptation of which permitted replication in and transmission among humans Tumpey et al., 2005; Webster et al., 1992) . The 1957 pandemic H2N2 virus emerged with substitutions of the HA, NA and PB1 gene segments into the evolved H1N1 viruses from an avian virus. The 1968 pandemic (H3N2) resulted from reassortments of the same avian sequences into multiple lineages of the evolved H2N2 viruses resulting in substitutions of HA and PB1 genes (Lindstrom et al., 2004) . In each of the twentieth century pandemics, therefore, both the HA and the PB1 genes were substituted. The nomenclature for distinguishing immunologically and epidemiologically important influenza A-type viruses is, therefore, incomplete.",

Since then, numerous studies have been proposed to quantify the burden of flu in humans. Flu outbreaks in temperate climates occur from November through April in Northern and from May through September in Southern hemispheres. While seasonal periods characterize flu outbreaks in Northern and Southern hemispheres, outbreaks in tropical climates are highly irregular and therefore more difficult to predict. Flu pandemics are worldwide epidemics that involve high morbidity and mortality resulting from major mutations in viral genome (antigenic shift). Unlike flu epidemics, pandemics do not necessarily occur in seasonal time. Some criteria for defining a major pandemic include the occurrence of a new emerging virus subtype for which humans have no immunity to and effective person-to-person contact. Three major pandemics have been observed in the last century. The first and foremost severe, the ''Spanish Flu'' (H1N1), occurred during 1918-1919. It is estimated that 20-50 million individuals succumbed to the disease worldwide (approximately 2% of a world's population), more than 25% of the US population became ill and 2.5% of those infected in the US died. The next major outbreaks, the ''Asian Flu'' (H2N2) and ''Hong Kong Flu'' (H3N2) emerged in 1957 and 1968, respectively. While the impact of these latter pandemics was considerably mild when compared to 1918-1919 pandemic, 2 and 1 million worldwide deaths were estimated to have come from the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, respectively (Simonsen et al., 1998) .",

Based on the excess criteria, an epidemic occurs when the number of disease cases (mortality) exceeds the number expected. However, defining the term epidemic may differ mildly. For instance, the US denotes an epidemic threshold for mortality based on estimated of the expected number of deaths given in a particular week accompanied by 95% confidence intervals around the projected estimate.

However, over the following decade total excess mortality has dropped to 1/3 that level and the fraction of the remainder attributable P&I dropped by 30%. Currently, this fraction has dropped to below 10% making the evaluation of flu-related burden a more challenging task. The burden associated with flu has been typically evaluated by a criterion that uses deaths recorded by physicians as caused by pneumonia and influenza (P&I) along with other measures such as influenza-like-illness (ILI). Excess mortality due to flu is calculated by estimating a baseline of deaths that would be expected in the absence of flu virus activity, and the number of deaths actually observed. This criterion, however, is not very sensitive as it fails to evaluate flu-related deaths that could have occurred outside the specified flu season or that could have been missed since several other diseases exhibit flu-like symptoms. Although P&I data has been widely used to evaluate excess mortality, it seems to account for about 25% of all flu related deaths; this suggests that estimates based on P&I may not be appropriate to measure the total impact of influenza on mortality (Simonsen et al., 1997) . Further efforts aimed to improve excess mortality estimates due to flu have used > all-cause mortality data instead.",

Further modifications of the Serfling model have been implemented. Thomson et al. proposed a Poisson regression model to predict excess cases of P&I during influenza epidemics .

Their findings showed that a yearly average of 133,900 cases listed as P&I hospitalizations were actually associated with the flu virus. A more recent study implemented a Poisson extension of the seasonal type model to predict excess cases of P&I during 16 seasons of flu epidemics in France (Denoeud et al., 2007) .

Estimates of monthly excess mortality for the 1957 pandemic yield 0.47 per 1,000 people (mid May). Although excess mortality during the1968 pandemic seems mild when compared the 1918 and 1957 outbreaks, this pandemic exhibited two waves. The first wave occurred in mid August with estimated monthly excess mortality of 0.27 per 1,000 people (543 deaths in a population of 2,012,000). Excess deaths peaked again in May-June of 1970 and with an estimated excess mortally in the order of 0.15 per 1,000 people (309 deaths in a population of 2,074,500).

A prospective surveillance study of 1665 healthy children younger than 5 years showed annual . (Lee et al., 2007) infection ranging between 15 and 42% (Neutzil et al., 2002) . It was further shown that children younger than 2-year of age were more likely than older children to have serious complications such as pneumonia, croup, chonchiolitis and sepsis (Neutzil et al., 2002) . A study assessing age-associated burden of flu in epidemic and pandemic periods showed that half of flu-related deaths during the 1968-1969, with larger proportions of those 1957-1958 and 1918-1919 were attributed to people younger than 65 years of age. This study further showed that the high number of cases observed in these pandemics decrease significantly in prospective outbreaks. More particularly, they found that after each pandemic, the absolute risk of flu-related mortality among people younger than 65 decreased from 7-to 28-fold over the following decade during severe epidemics. In contrast, the corresponding risk reductions among those people older than 65 years of age range from 2-to 3-fold or less (Simonsen et al., 1998) . A multiple source data study of the UK during 1995-1999 showed that on average 10% of children contract clinical influenza while a further 20% may be asymptomatic for children younger than 5 years old (Watkins, 2004) . While vaccination is the optimal choice for protecting young age children, and thereby, reducing the burden of flu in this group, it has also been shown that the risk to other members of the population can be reduced through children vaccination. Ahmed et al. showed that vaccinating young age children improved community level protection (Ahmed et al., 2001) . So far, our discussion of the burden of flu in children has been limited to countries in which flu outbreaks arise during the winter. However, recent studies of flu-related mortality in tropical and subtropical regions show that burden to children in these parts of the world could exceed the US estimates. Unlike developed countries, children in developing countries face additional challenges such as malnutrition, higher risks associated with bacterial infections, limited access to pharmaceuticals, limited health care, and poor living conditions (Simonsen, 2001) . Studies of Cuba and Singapore reported 3-15% flu-related viral isolates in hospitalized children (Cancio et al., 2000; Chew et al., 1998) .",

Under this program, vaccination levels reached 80%. > Figure 81 -2 illustrates decreasing mortality trends from all-cause and pneumonia related mortalities. However, this figure also shows that as soon as vaccination measures were relaxed in 1987, flu-related mortality increased. The rising levels of excess mortality became even more evident after government discontinued the vaccination program in 1997. It has been estimated that the vaccination of children in Japan prevented about 37,000-49,000 deaths per year (Reichert et al., 2001) . Other studies have shown that high (50-70%) levels of vaccination among children can provide effective protection to other members in a community (Elveback et al., 1976; Longini et al., 1978; Longini et al., 1988) .

However, evaluating indirect costs such as loss of days of school and work, loss of productivity is significantly more challenging. During an influenza season it is likely that a large number of its members may be exposed to infection, particularly during the epidemic season. However, the highest risk of hospitalization occurs among infants (younger than 1 year) and the elderly (older than 65 years). Estimates of 90% of cases attributed to flu occur among the elderly. Although flu is not typically reported as the cause for hospitalization, it is most certainly a disease that sets the stage for the complication of other diseases such as pneumonia and chronic illness. Complications of already existing chronic long standing illness due to the flu are likely to result in increased hospitalization periods and more costly treatment, thereby increasing the cost for each person at risk. In the US, flu contributes approximately 1-3 billion (US) in direct medical cost each year (US Congress, 1981) . Estimates of 10-15 billion (US) for indirect costs related to mortality include lost earnings due to illness and lost of future earnings (US Congress, 1981) . A French study (1989) estimated the direct and indirect contribution of influenza burden at FF1.9 billion (US: 300 million) and FF14.3 billion (US: 2.3 billion), respectively (Levy, 1996) .

These models assume a deterministic, stochastic or individual-level framework (among others) to capture the dynamics of disease transmission among individuals in a population of study. A deterministic compartmental epidemic model makes several assumptions. First, a model's behavior is determined (i.e., deterministic) precisely by initial conditions and parameter values (i.e., no elements of chance are involved). For instance, an initial population size of 500 susceptible and one infectious individual, fixed rates of disease transmission, recovery, and mortality. Second, compartmental implies that the state of the system is given by the number of people in each of the predetermined number of compartments (epidemiological states), for instance susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). A model is dynamic since the number of individuals in each epidemiological state (S, I, R) changes over time. The progression to disease is captured by the rate at which susceptible become infected and it depends on the number of currently infected hosts in a population. Although deterministic models do not capture random events, they can be extended to incorporate stochasticity. In this setting, events occur randomly, rather than deterministically. Stochastic models are particularly appealing when assessing the spread of disease in small populations where random events are likely to play an important role in the emergence dynamics of disease. Deterministic and stochastic models that characterize individuals in a population into subpopulations according to their current epidemiological state, for instance, Pandemic Influenza: Potential Contribution to Disease Burden susceptible (S) and infected (I) are inappropriate to evaluate individual-level dynamics. For instance, rather than considering the subpopulation of all susceptible, one may be interested in accounting more specifically for age, gender or differences in risk (e.g. high-risk vs. low-risk) among individuals in a population. The level of detail that is observed in a heterogeneous population has been assessed using individual-level simulation models.",

This quantity measures the average number of secondary cases of infection generated by one primary case in a fully susceptible population. R 0 is composed of three contributions: the susceptible population available to have contact with a primary case (S 0 ), the length of time (D) the primary case is infectious to others (window of opportunity for infection), and the transmission coefficient b (rate of effective mixing). Together this yields the following formula: R 0 = b D S 0 . A value of R 0 equal to one or below defines a transmission threshold under which the generation of new cases is insufficient to support spread of disease within a community. However, R 0 greater than one indicates that the infection will be able to spread in a population. A larger value of R 0 suggests the possibility of a more severe pandemic outbreak. For instance, estimates of R 0 between 2 and 3 were proposed for the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu pandemic (Mills et al., 2004) .",

A recent study reported the findings from three groups (UW/LANL, Imperial/ Pitt and VBI group) that implemented individual-based stochastic simulation models to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing the burden of a potential pandemic influenza (Halloran et al., 2008) . Comparisons were based on the simulation of a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago (approximately 3.6 million people). These simulations considered the following interventions: antiviral treatment and household > isolation of identified cases, prophylaxis and > quarantine of household contacts, closure of school, social distancing measures implemented in the workplace and the overall community. This study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of these measures as projected by each of the individual-based stochastic simulation models and to assess the robustness of these results to the model assumptions. The results from these three simulation models produced similar effectiveness of the interventions evaluated. More particularly, this study showed that the timely intervention of these measures reduces the final number of flu illness, for pandemics of moderate severity; all models show that NPIs are highly effective. Moreover, school closure is predicted to be highly important in all three model simulations. This study showed that under the levels of compliance (30-90%) and ascertainment (60-80%) assumed in these simulations, that it is quite possible to mitigate a pandemic, at least until a vaccine becomes available. The implications of these studies suggest possible routes that may be used to ameliorate the burden of a potential pandemic. However, the uncertainty involved ascertainment and compliance of cases is likely to play a significant role in the effectiveness of the proposed social distancing and targeted measures.",

Although vaccine is the optimal approach at curtailing a flu pandemic, antivirals (therapeutic and prophylaxis) are likely to play an important role in reducing the burden. The use of multiple pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the burden of disease associated with a pandemic was evaluated in several studies (Ferguson et al., 2005; Germann et al., 2006 , Longini et al., 2004 , Longini et al., 2005 . Choosing a plan that includes massive stockpiling of antivirals, targeted antiviral prophylaxis, massive pre-vaccination of high-risk individuals or a combination of any of these involves various levels of uncertainty and complexity. The foremost important factor in determining the approach to be implemented is to determine the level of resources available at the time that a pandemic virus emerges. Next, one must consider the potential complications that involve the use of antivirals. For example, should they be implemented as treatment or prophylaxis? Which of these two approaches is more economically efficient and likely to provide higher levels of community protection? Are there any implications of viral resistance with the use of antiviral treatment versus prophylaxis? In efforts to prepare for a future pandemic, countries (worldwide) have drafted preparedness plans. These efforts include pharmaceutical interventions such as antiviral treatment and vaccine and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, closing of public gatherings. To this end, several studies have been proposed to evaluate the role of these various interventions in minimizing the risk of a potential pandemic. A recent study assessed the current preparedness plans in the US, UK and the Netherlands and simulated single as well as combined intervention strategies during a pandemic (Nu\u00f1o et al., 2007) . The interventions proposed in this study included vaccine, antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and basic hospital and community level transmission control measures. This study showed that while vaccine was optimal in reducing the burden during a pandemic, antiviral and basic control measures can be highly effective. The main findings in this study showed that the ''optimal'' plan for a particular country is contingent upon the resources available. That is, in countries with limited pharmaceutical interventions, the use of antivirals as treatment was preferred over prophylaxis. Moreover, in countries with little or no access to a vaccine or antivirals, the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as basic transmission control measures can be highly effective in reducing the burden due to influenza. This study proposed that the implementation of social behavioral measures that could effectively reduce a person's risk of infection were significant in reducing the burden of disease. ",

As discussed, there are several challenges involved in evaluating the accurate burden of flu; the non-specific nature of the illness typically lends itself for an incomplete confirmation of cases that is likely to be attributed to the flu virus. For instance, it is possible that a person may experience an infection without the presence of symptoms and therefore escape surveillance systems. It is also possible that those infected individuals develop symptoms but choose to be cared for at home and therefore do not report to a clinic or hospital. Aside from the challenges involved in the surveillance and timely collection of data, this study emphasized that current methods for evaluating the burden of influenza are applicable in some cases to countries with temperate climates. A summary of the burden in tropical and subtropical regions of the world showed that in fact, the burden of flu has been highly underestimated. These findings suggest that an effective preparedness plan should be based on a global and accurate assessment of the burden. That is, building a capacity (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions) that is aimed at reducing the burden of developed and developing countries is essential for the well-being of communities worldwide.",

As suggested in the evaluation of single and combined intervention plans for the US, UK and the Netherlands, Nu\u00f1o et al. showed that the strategy of implementing antivirals in treatment or as prophylaxis will strongly depend on the level of resources available (Nu\u00f1o et al., 2007) . Countries with limited resources should opt for treatment rather than prophylaxis. An overwhelming conclusion from the studies that have evaluated various forms of interventions to curtail pandemic flu is that vaccine is clearly the optimal choice. However, there are practical limitations with the use of a vaccine. Foremost importantly, vaccine is unlikely to be available at the time a pandemic virus emerges in humans, as current methods for developing a flu vaccine require several months. Once a vaccine becomes available, it is uncertain how many doses each person would require for protection. With current manufacturing capabilities only about one third of the US population is likely to have access to a vaccine. Unfortunately, the level of resources that may be available for developing countries is likely to be much lower than the US and other developed parts of the world.",

However, the success of a NPI-based approach will likely be conditional on its timely and continuous implementation throughout the entire pandemic period (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007; Markel et al., 2006; Markel et al., 2007) . Early relaxation of these measures could further magnify the spread of a pandemic and yield devastating levels of morbidity and mortality. An optimal plan for preparing against a prospective flu pandemic is contingent upon the availability of pharmaceutical resources, its potential complications and the social demands that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, closing of public gathering will have in a society.",
