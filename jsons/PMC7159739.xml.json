            "text": "Shrimp aquaculture has undergone a rapid expansion in recent decades. However, bacterial and viral infections represent a major constraint affecting the industry due to significant economic losses. The yellow head virus (YHV) and the white spot syndrome virus have been reported to be the most dangerous viruses for cultivated shrimp (Durand, Tang & Lightner 2000), and besides virulence, the epizooties are typically associated with poor management and/or environmental conditions. Yellow head virus epizooties cause up to 100% mortality 3\u20135 days after virus introduction (Wongteerasupaya, Sriurairatana, Vicker, Akrajamorn, Boonsaeng, Panyim, Tassanakajon, Withyachumnarnkul & Flegel 1995), and an effective treatment is not available. In addition to its high virulence and infectiveness, YHV is a very risky virus (Boonyaratpalin, Supamattaya, Kasornchandra, Direkbusaracom, Aekpanithanpong & Chantanachookin 1993), as it is also able to naturally infect other shrimp populations, which can then act as natural reservoirs (Lu, Tapay, Brock & Loh 1994; Ma, Overstreet & Jovonovich 2009).",

            "text": "Based on its morphology, YHV was originally classified as a Baculovirus (Boonyaratpalin et al. 1993). However, by genomic taxonomy, YHV is classified as an Okavirus, a member of the Roniviridae family that characteristically has a (+)ssRNA genome (Cowley, Dimmock, Wongteerasupaya, Boonsaeng, Panyim & Walker 1999; Cowley, Dimmock, Spann & Walker 2000; Sittidilokratna, Hodgson, Cowley, Jitrapakdee, Boonsaeng, Panyim & Walker 2002; Gonz\u00e1lez, Gomez\u2010Puertas, Cavanagh, Gorbalenya & Enjuanes 2003; Gorbalenya, Enjuanes, Ziebuhr & Snijder 2006; Pasternak, Spaan & Snijder 2006). The insertion of YHV into Nidovirales was supported by similarities in both its genomic organization and its replication mechanism (1997, 2006, 2008). In Nidovirales, including YHV, the key biochemical machinery for virus replication is typically encoded by a large discontinuous open reading frame (ORF), referred to as ORF1a and ORF1b, which overlap in a small area containing a\u22121 ribosomal frameshift (2000, 2006, 2002). Other genomic regions include ORF2, which encodes the nucleocapsid and envelope proteins (2002, 2004, 2006, 2003, 2006); ORF3, which encodes the precursors for the envelope glycoproteins GP116 and GP64 (2002, 2003); and ORF4, which is interrupted by multiple stop codons (1997, 2008).",

            "text": "Even though considerable progress has been made in the characterization of the YHV genome (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008), information on viral gene expression during infection is limited. Using specific monoclonal antibodies, expression of the envelope (GP64 and GP116) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins was monitored in five species of prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii, Macrobrachium lanchesteri, Macrobrachium sintangense, Palaemon styliferus and Penaeus serrifer) that had been experimentally infected (Longyant, Sithigorngul, Chaivisuthangkura, Rukpratanporn, Sithigorngul & Menasveta 2005). Penaeus serrifer, P. styliferus and M. sintangense exhibited mild to moderate YHV infection symptoms 3 days postinjection, and the infection severity was significantly reduced after 10 days. Conversely, M. rosenbergii and M. lanchesteri did not show symptoms, even though viral proteins were detected in the first hour post\u2010infection, suggesting a natural resistance to YHV infection and/or the ability to efficiently eliminate the virus. A similar response was observed in Penaeus (Metapenaeus) affinis and Pseudocalea brevicornis, suggesting that some prawns are able to gradually eliminate the virus by an unknown mechanism (Longyant, Sattaman, Chaivisuthangkura, Rukpratanporn, Sithigorngul & Sithigorngul 2006). Interestingly, experimentally infected Litopenaeus vannamei and Litopenaeus stylirostris show symptoms and mortality profiles similar ot those of naturally infected cultivated Penaeus monodon (Lu, Tapay, Loh, Brock & Gose 1995; Spann, Cowley, Walker & Lester 1997; Pantoja & Lightner 2003).",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to sequence the genome of the YHV\u2010Lv strain and compare it with the sequences of virulent strains to determine genomic differences that could explain the lack of infectivity and/or virulence in L. vannamei.

They have also been demonstrated to determine virulence (Phillips, Chua, Lavi & Weiss 1999; Almazan, Gonzalez, Penzes, Izeta, Calvo, Plana\u2010Duran & Enjuanes 2000) because they are key proteins in the recognition of host cells and the fusion of the virus to the cellular membrane (1997, 2003, 2006). Similar functions have been reported for the surface glycoproteins GP64 and GP116 of YHV and GAV (2002, 2003). Focusing the genomic analysis on the GP116\u2010encoding region, significant differences could be observed between any YHV strain and the less aggressive pathogen GAV, suggesting the role of this protein in virulence. The YHV\u2010Lv GP116\u2010encoding region seems to be more similar to the Cholburi than the Chachoengsao corresponding genomic region. Interestingly, the Chachoengsao strain was responsible for epizooties in Thailand (Wijegoonawardane, Cowley, Phan, Hodgson, Nielsen, Kiatpathomchai & Walker 2008), while there have not been reports of extended damage associated with the Cholburi strain. Additionally, several low pathogenic genotypes of YHV have been identified in India, Malaysia, Mozambique, Thailand and Philippines (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008), and in an earlier work, the authors associated such a behaviour with detectable differences in the GP116 N\u2010terminal region (Sittidilokratna, Chotwiwatthanakun, Wijegoonawardane, Unajak, Boonnad, Wangnai, Jitrapakdee, Cowley & Walker 2009).",

Although haemocytes and pleopods showed the most intense signal, the isolation of total RNA from haemocytes requires a careful manipulation of the sample to avoid degranulation or cellular lysis. Thus, pleopods were selected as the sampling tissue for monitoring the expression of 3CLPRO, POL, GP116 and GP64 as a measurement of the replicative capability of the YHV\u2010Lv.",

            "text": "The selected genes, 3CLPRO, POL, GP116 and GP64, are relevant in viral replication and interaction with the host cell. In Nidovirales, 3CLPRO is responsible for the post\u2010translational release of key proteins for replication (2002, 2006, 2008, 2000, 2003), while the polymerase is the most conserved gene and thus has been used to propose a common ancestor for all Nidovirales (2000, 1997, 2002). As in all Nidovirales studied, the structural glycoproteins, GP116 and GP64, are involved in the interaction with host cells (2003, 2006, 2003), and specifically, GP116 has been associated with the pathogenic behaviour of several YHV strains (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008). According to the results shown in Fig. 4, three phases could be defined: (a) the first phase from 1.5 to 24 h postinoculation; (b) the second phase from 24 to 72 h postinoculation, is characterized by a fast increment in gene expression (> two orders); and (c) the third phase from 72 to 96 h postinoculation, shows a slow increment in gene expression. The gene expression profile is compatible with the viral replication model, initially proposed by Ellis and Delbruck (1939). The first phase, associated with virus adsorption and/or penetration, and the third phase, related to virus assembly and release, characteristically show low gene expression, while the second phase is differentiated by a fast increment in gene expression probably due to virus replication.",

            "text": "In addition, five shrimp were sampled during the second phase (24, 48 and 72 h postinoculation) and analysed individually. Although comparable expression profiles could be established, quantitative differences were detected (Fig. 4) among individuals and, consequently, high dispersion was obtained. For example, at 96 h postinfection, the number of copies of GP64 ranged from 105 to 108, although discrete dispersion was observed for GP116 (105\u2013106) and 3CLPRO (107\u2013108). Then the curve slope from 24 to 72 h, representing the expression rate, was calculated for each gene and each shrimp. Equimolecular concentrations of 3CLPRO and POL coding sequences are expected because they are transcribed together as the replicase polyprotein 1ab, which is encoded by two large overlapping ORFs (ORF1a/1b) that contain the \u22121 ribosomal frame shift. After transcription, 3CLPRO and POL functional proteins are produced by site\u2010specific cleavage of the replicase polyprotein 1ab. However, 3CLPRO was highly expressed almost immediately after viral inoculation, increasing to 2.08 \u00d7 105 copies \u03bcL\u22121 at 1.5 h, while POL showed a modest expression (\u2245102 copies \u03bcL\u22121). Afterwards both transcripts displayed similar increasing rates, but maintained the 3CLPRO/POL ratio around 103. Likewise, GP116 and GP64 are encoded by ORF3, but different concentrations of their corresponding transcripts were detected, mainly between 24 and 48 h, when the concentration of the GP64 transcript rapidly increased (Fig. 4). These disparities could not be explained due to the poorly understood replication and transcription mechanisms in Nidovirales where sub\u2010genomic mRNA and double\u2010stranded RNA intermediates, as well as the poorly described non\u2010structural proteins seem to be implicated (2007, 2006). The importance of 3CLPRO for Nidovirales replication has been corroborated by the silencing of this gene in YHV\u2010infected P. monodon, which caused a strong inhibition of viral replication, whereas silencing GP116 and GP64 was less efficient (2005, 2007, 2006, 2003). As shown in Fig. 4, 3CLPRO is highly expressed early, perhaps because this protein is required for creating other functional viral proteins by proteolytic cleavage (Ziebuhr et al. 2000). On the other hand, transcripts of the structural glycoproteins GP116 and GP64 also showed different concentrations. This could be due to differences in the hydrolytic action of RNases where polyA tails have a degradation\u2010protective role (1997, 2006).",

In this way, two shrimp (Org 3 and Org 5) showed a lower viral expression rate (Fig. 5) and this could be associated with individual resistance to virus attachment. Expression of viral genes is associated with viral replication and disease severity; hence, organisms with high viral replication should be more susceptible than those with lower rates of virus replication. Considering that viral replication is complete 24\u201372 h after inoculation, the slope in this time frame is representative of the gene expression rate and could be used as a measurement of viral susceptibility. Although further experiments are required, viral replication analysis could be used to establish shrimp infection status and expression levels associated with disease.",
