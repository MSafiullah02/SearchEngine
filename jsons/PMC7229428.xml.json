He was inspired by the \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d design of the multiple occupancy condition in ocean liners [1, 2]. Nowadays, in 2020, apart from sporadic cases of design in Europe and Asia, this architectural paradigm has been treated essentially just as part of the literature or even as an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d architectural ideology. It has not managed yet to approach the thinking of Le Corbusier in a unified manner and thus the question persists. That is, how can we design units for living in, which can retain occupants in self-sufficient spaces where dwellers can be safe and healthy, physically and mentally?",

The outdoor green spaces were also treated to imitate the interior spaces by creating green walls, pathways, and gateways to other green areas. Nowadays, the obesity of the engineering gene (i.e., overbuilding activity) in conjunction with the human need to remain close to natures has led to high-density living. Densely built spaces now take over the ground. Green spaces are finally swallowed by building footprints and \u201cregurgitated\u201d by design in built-up spaces, cantilevered on sky-bridges and sky-decks.",

If such a hypothesis holds, then architectural design should consider bringing nature back into its units of living in, not in flower pots but by offering real plots of soil on the floor of each house where people can do their small house gardening. Creating the sense of belonging and security however is more complicated than a plot of land and water on the floor of public housing environments at all moments.
