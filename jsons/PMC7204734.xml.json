Recent publications [[1], [2], [3]] have described neurological manifestations in COVID-19 involving the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS) and muscle, as well as early alterations of olfaction and taste [4]. The Environmental Neurology Specialty Group of the World Federation of Neurology concluded that the potential neurological involvement in COVID-19 is a topic of major importance that necessitates a global effort to obtain the neuroepidemiological and clinical data required to quantify the magnitude of the problem, to define the full range of the neurological disease and to encourage neuropathological, physiopathological and therapeutic research. We proposed the creation of international COVID-19 neurological registries to collect and assemble data on acute, chronic and any long-latency effects on the infection on the nervous system [5]. This followed the example of the Spanish Neurological Society (Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Neurolog\u00eda, SEN) [www.sen.es] that, in the midst of one of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 in Europe, managed to implement a registry of de novo acute and subacute neurological manifestations in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Future research will define issues of congenital involvement \u2013such as seen in maternal infections with Zika virus\u2013 or long-latency brain disorders following in utero, perinatal or early childhood infections. While presently unknown in COVID-19, we should be alert to the possibility of tardive disorders comparable to measles-associated Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis or Progressive Rubella Panencephalitis; as well as long-term neurological disease, for example late Parkinsonism that occurred among survivors of Encephalitis Lethargica [6] during the 1918\u20131920 influenza pandemic [7] and, more recently, the increased risk of narcolepsy observed in 2009\u20132010 after the swine flu pandemic due to influenza A with concurrent vaccination using a monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine [8].",

            "text": "The coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses with the largest known RNA genome, ranging from 26.2 to 31.7 kilobases [21]. The genome contains a 5\u2032 cap and is composed of six to ten open reading frames (ORFs). There are three main viral proteins in the envelope of the virion: the spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M) and the envelope protein (E). The spike glycoprotein mediates virus entry and determines the range of potential hosts, cell tropism and disease pathogenesis [29]. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor to infect ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes [20], which explains the severity of the pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity than SARS-CoV-1 for the ACE2 receptor, which is present in neurons and endothelial cells indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to previous coronaviruses [30]. MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and the carcinoembryonic antigen\u2013related cell-adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) cofactor ligand to infect unciliated bronchial cells [20]. After binding to the receptor, viruses fuse their envelope with the host cell membrane and the nucleocapsids reach the target cell. The fusion involves large conformational changes of the spike protein [31].",

There is abundant experimental animal evidence that coronaviruses can reach the brain via spillage from the lungs to the circulatory system or by axonal transport and transneuronal spread from olfactory and trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal epithelium [30,32]. Some coronaviruses experimentally can spread from airway mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors to the medullary cardio-respiratory centers [33]. Viruses can also access the nervous system via the circumventricular organs [34] that normally lack a blood-brain barrier (BBB) and via dorsal root ganglia and autonomic (including cardiac) ganglia [35] both of which have no blood-nerve barrier (BNB). Indeed, the previously mentioned swine coronavirus PHEMV can establish ganglionic infection of sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia after peripheral inoculation [35].",

Varga and colleagues [36] demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 causes infection of endothelial cells and endotheliitis; thereby, systemic vascular endotheliitis promotes vasoconstriction, edema and a pro-coagulate state [37] with important implications relevant to cerebrovascular stroke. According to Flammer et al. [38] the vascular endothelium is an active paracrine, endocrine, and autocrine organ that is indispensable for the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homoeostasis. Endothelial microvascular dysfunction leads to vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischemia, inflammation with associated tissue edema, and a pro-thrombotic state [37,38]. Endothelial dysfunction is also an important factor for atherosclerosis [37,38]",

Of interest, Yeh et al.

Moreover, human coronavirus RNA has been demonstrated in CSF [42] and in brains of patients with MS [43,44]. Arbour and colleagues [45] using RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of HCoV RNA in 44% of brain tissue samples from 90 patients with neuropathology-proven MS.",

Brain edema and focal degeneration of neurons was found together with ultrastructural confirmation of viral infection of neurons and glial cells by SARS-CoV-1 was found. Neuropathological changes included degeneration and necrosis of neurons, extensive glial cell hyperplasia, and cellular infiltrates, but demyelination was not present. Xu and colleagues [47] isolated a SARS coronavirus strain from brain tissue of a patient with SARS and symptoms of severe CNS involvement. Pathologic examination of the brain revealed necrosis of neurons and gliosis. In addition, by immunostaining tissue sections they showed that a monokine induced by interferon-\u0393 (Mig) was expressed in glial cells along with infiltration of CD68+ monocytes/macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes in the brain parenchyma. Blood levels of interferon-\u0393\u2013inducible protein 10 and Mig in the blood were highly elevated but other cytokines and chemokines were normal [47].",

Among 214 patients with COVID-19 from 3 hospitals in Wuhan, China [3] hypogeusia was reported in 5.6% and hyposmia in 5.1%. A much higher incidence of these disorders has been described in European patients. A multi-center study involving 12 European hospitals conducted by the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federation of Oto-rhino-laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS) [4] recruited 417 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and found olfactory dysfunction in 85.6% and gustatory dysfunction in 88%; both symptoms were often associated, and early olfactory recovery occurred in 44% [4]. In severe COVID-19 cases, alterations of smell and taste occurred before any other complaints in 11.8% of the cases. According to Xydakis [72], the American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2014Head and Neck Surgery and the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology have recommended adding anosmia-dysgeusia to the list of primary screening symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These symptoms often occur in the absence of nasal congestion or rhinorrhea in patients with mild or no constitutional symptoms [73,74].",

            "text": "Because of the frequent occurrence of anosmia-dysgeusia, Li and colleagues [75] suggested that viral neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 could result in invasion of the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) [30,75], the olfactory brain and then the brain stem causing the irreversible respiratory failure typical of severe COVID-19. The neurotropism of coronaviruses has been demonstrated before. In 2007, Suzuki et al. [76] were able to identify coronaviruses in the nasal discharge of patients who failed to recover olfaction after a cold. Animal models have shown that the nasal route is a well-recognized pathway for neurotropic viruses to reach the brain [32,33,71,77]. Given the importance of the ACE2 receptor in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, Netland and colleagues [78] using mice transgenic for human ACE2 demonstrated that the virus enters the brain through the olfactory bulb and uses rapid transneuronal spread to reach olfactory cortex, basal ganglia and midbrain (dorsal raphe) nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus tractus solitarii and area postrema causing neuronal death in the absence of encephalitis. A similar pattern of brain invasion was demonstrated in human brains from patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection [42,79]. It has been proposed that viral neurotropism could explain the severity of respiratory failure in COVID-19 [75] and the absence of dyspnea [80]. Mutations of the S protein of the coronavirus [81] or variations in population genetics for expression of ACE2 [82] could determine the divergences in the pattern of respiratory problems in COVID-19.",

Pathology examination demonstrated lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, small intestine and liver.

The authors [36] postulate that this mechanism could explain the widespread endothelial dysfunction associated with apoptosis and multi-organ vascular involvement observed in severe COVID-19 infections.

ACE2 is the enzyme that physiologically counters the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) degrading angiotensin II to angiotensin- (1\u20137), attenuating vasoconstriction and sodium retention [97]. The use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) during the COVID-19 pandemic was the topic of an extensive review by Vaduganathan and colleagues [97] who concluded that ACE2 may be beneficial and that the withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors in high-risk cardiovascular patients may be harmful. This is in agreement with the results of a retrospective, multi-center study in Hubei province, China [99], which included 1128 hypertensive patients with COVID-19 demonstrating that the use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality.",

            "text": "Poyiadji et al. [61] from Detroit, Michigan, USA, described brain-imaging findings in a woman in her late fifties who presented with COVID-19 infection, demonstrated by a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. CSF showed no bacterial growth and was negative for Herpes simplex 1\u20132 virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and West Nile virus. Coronavirus could not be tested in the CSF. CT brain demonstrated bilateral and symmetric hypoattenuation within the medial thalami with normal CT angiogram and CT venogram. Brain MRI showed bilateral hemorrhagic rim-enhancing lesions in the thalami, medial temporal lobes, and subinsular regions. The authors concluded that the patient presented acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (AHNE). This rare condition is usually considered a parainfectious disease [99]; it has been associated with influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B, parainfluenza, VZV, human herpes viruses HHV-6 and HHV-7, enteroviruses, the novel reovirus strain serotype 2 (MRV2Tou05), rotaviruses, HSV, rubella, coxsackie A9, and measles viruses, among which H1N1 and HHV-6 are the most common [99]. AHNE is not an encephalitis and the CSF usually shows no pleocytosis. It is generally accepted that AHNE may be caused by a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [100] resulting in elevation of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-10, IL-15, IL-1\u03b2, soluble TNF receptor, and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), plus lymphocytes, in particular CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells leading to brain injury through alterations of the BBB by trypsin and matrix metalloprotease-9 without vessel wall disruption. AHNE may also occur following vaccination, in particular with the DPTw (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis whole cell) vaccine [99]. COVID-19 fatalities have been associated with a hyperinflammatory syndrome manifested by a growing HScore [101] decreasing platelet counts, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and increased levels of IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1, TNF-\u03b1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 [100]. Proposed treatments include steroids, IVIg, and selective cytokine blockade with anakinra, tocilizumab, or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition [99,100].",

Seven days earlier she had fever, cough, and had developed pneumonia positive for SARS-CoV-2. NCV/EMG confirmed an axonal variant of GBS. The first CSF was normal but the second one showed high protein (101 mg/dL); CSF-RT-PCR was negative twice. During IVIg treatment, she developed bulbar symptoms with dysphagia and tongue weakness, which required assisted ventilation. Patient 2: A 23-year-old man with a 2-day history of mastoid pain, complete facial weakness, ageusia and leg paresthesias. Ten days earlier, the patient had fever and sore throat. On exam he had complete bilateral facial palsy, areflexia and sensory ataxia. EMG confirmed lower-extremity axonal sensory-motor neuropathy with sural nerve sparing and decreased facial nerve cMAP. CSF protein was high (1123 mg/dL) with negative virus test and anti-ganglioside antibodies. He was treated with IVIg with some improvement. Patient 3: A 55-year-old man with 10 days of fever, cough and COVID-19 pneumonia; he developed neck pain, paresthesias in the 4 limbs and lower leg weakness. On day 12, he developed areflexic tetraparesis with severe axonal neuropathy. CSF showed elevated protein (123 mg/dL) and a negative coronavirus test. He developed facial diplegia and respiratory failure with IVIg and required assisted ventilation due to neuromuscular impairment. Patient 4: A 76-year-old man with a 5-day history of cough and anosmia evolving into COVID-19 pneumonia. He was admitted with low-back pain and leg weakness that progressed rapidly to areflexic tetraparesis. CSF was normal with a negative virus test. IVIg treatment produced motor improvement more evident in the arms but he was still unable to walk. Patient 5: A 61-year-old man with a one-week history of asthenia, anosmia and ageusia. Noticed problem climbing stairs and leg paresthesias and was unable to stand up on awakening. He had generalized areflexia and paraparesis. COVID-19 oropharyngeal test was negative and CSF was normal with negative coronavirus CSF-RT-PCR. Anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. On the second day of IVIg therapy, he developed flaccid tetraplegia with facial weakness and dysphagia; he eventually required tracheostomy and assisted ventilation. Serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive on admission. In sum, GBS occurred 5 to 10 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, a typical interval. Clinical neurophysiology was consistent with axonal-type GBS in 3 cases and demyelinating-type in 2 patients. Post-Gadolinium MRI showed enhancement of caudal nerve roots in 2 patients and the facial nerve in one. All patients were treated with IVIg and Patients 1 and 3 received two cycles. A similar treatment was used in GBS patients during the MERS outbreak [111].",

After high fever at night (40 \u00b0C), he developed acute flaccid paralysis of the legs along with urinary and bowel incontinence. He had decreased strength in the arms (MRC 3/5) with normal bilateral reflexes in upper extremities and flaccid paralysis in the legs (MRC 0/5) with bilateral hyporeflexia but without pathologic reflexes. Sensation was intact in the arms but was globally impaired in both legs with a T10 sensory level. CT brain revealed basal ganglia and paraventricular lacunar infarctions. CSF and MRI were not done due to pandemic preventive measures. A possible cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed based on the high fever, leukocytosis, low serum iron (1.80 \u03bcmol/L, normal = 10.6\u201336.7 \u03bcmol/L), elevated serum ferritin (>2000 ng/mL, normal = 21.81\u2013274.6 ng/mL) and high levels of CRP, serum amyloid protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6. Following treatment, muscle strength in both upper limbs recovered (MRC 4/5) with minimal improvement in the legs (MRC 1/5). Rules out were possible infectious causes of myelitis [115], including Mycoplasma pneumoniae [116], Chlamydia pneumoniae, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), influenza A-B virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coxsackieviruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and respiratory syncytial virus. Tuberculosis infection was negative. The authors postulated that myelitis was the result of direct SARS-CoV-2 given that ACE2 receptors are expressed on the surface membranes of spinal cord neurons [117] combined with a cytokine storm syndrome [99,100].",

In about half of the cases (44%), the defense mechanisms control the infection and early olfactory recovery occurs [4]. In some of the remaining patients, the viral neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 probably invades the brain via axonal transport and transneuronal spread from the olfactory nerves to the rhinencephalon finally reaching the brainstem causing the irreversible respiratory failure of severe COVID-19, typically characterized by lack of dyspnea [74].",

The same is true of the pandemic at large, and, as expressed by Lipsitch and colleagues [128], epidemiological studies are needed to provide solid information on total numbers of cases, including mild ones, risk factors and timing of transmission, severity and attack rate; as well as risk factors for severe outcomes including death, and timing and intensity of infectiousness determined by viral shedding studies.",

The Environmental Neurology Specialty Group of the World Federation of Neurology (ENSG-WFN) issued an appeal [5] to neurological societies around the globe to develop national or regional COVID-19 neuroepidemiological databanks. Neurologists and physicians at the front line of this pandemic are asked to report to each society all cases of new-onset, acute, delayed and long-latency neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The worldwide response to this pandemic encourages us to believe that regional neurologists and physicians, government authorities, and scientists with expertise in Public Health, epidemiology, infectious diseases, virology, neurosciences and other relevant fields will be willing to advise and assist neurological societies to achieve the goal of creating national and regional databases. This will also encourage much needed peer-reviewed publications on the neurology of COVID-19. We will work to assure that the results of the national registries are collected, posted and become freely available at the WFN website [https://wfneurology.org]. This global effort should help the world understand the neurological impact of COVID-19.",
