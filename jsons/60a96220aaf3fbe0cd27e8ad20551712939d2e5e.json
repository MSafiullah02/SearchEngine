In such a setting, treatment decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis and patient stratification is needed considering the prevailing situation. Our evidence to date, which rely on our anecdotal experiences, suggests that the vast majority of patients with cancer are concerned about contracting COVID-19 and ask both us and our colleagues for advice. This is occurring at a time when hospital attention is understandably diverted away from planned, elective care, and such individuals are increasingly scared to come to hospitals, regarded understandably as infection epicentres.",

Although there are specific issues, for example, the radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia are similar in some cases to pneumonitis caused by checkpoint inhibitors [2] , the main concern we have is that once infected, patients with cancer may be at higher risk for the more severe form of COVID-19 requiring intensive care treatment [1] . Thus, for those infected, it seems reasonable to suggest that regular surveillance including monitoring oxygen saturations should be provided and perhaps if an infection occurs during chemotherapyinduced neutropenia, hospital admission would seem appropriate. Whether patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection should stop their anti-cancer therapy or not remains debated; one reported patient with lung cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 continued targeted therapy during the course of virus infection [3] . Intriguingly, patients with cancer co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis B do not have viral re-activation during chemotherapy [4] , suggesting here that treatment does not need to stop, although of course, data may be different for different viruses and symptoms of COVID-19 may not correlate with SARS-CoV-2 levels.",

Many adjuvant patients benefit a great deal more than 5%, as much as 30% in absolute terms in patients with breast cancer at high risk, for example, but there are no data on who to treat or not during the pandemic. In terms of risk, there is no separate hazard ratio for use of chemotherapy as this will be treatment (drug, dose density and frequency), host (age, perhaps sex too), intent (palliative versus curative) and tumour (stage, type) dependent; the only direct report is threefourth of patients receiving chemotherapy needed intensive care or died (but only a sample of 4) [7] . Immunotherapy has clearly different risks, as does underlying co-morbidities, notably hypertension or any pulmonary disease. The additional effects due to bed capacity, for example, giving chemotherapy when there is no intensive care availability, are challenging.",

In patients with cancer infected with SARS- CoV-2, inhibiting excessive immune cell activation and cytokine production is probably central, although use of corticosteroids is controversial [9, 10] . It is notable to us that one of the best prospects for treating the virus modulates the host immune response and is useful too in treating manifestations of the rare cancer, multicentric Castleman's disease, as well as its licenced rheumatoid arthritis indication [11] ; targeting the IL-6 pathway using tocilizumab has led to inclusion in China's latest version of diagnosis and treatment guidelines on COVID-19 [12] . Because antieprogrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy has been implicated as useful in treatment of chronic infections [13] , a Chinese manufactured antibody, camrelizumab, is being investigated in patients without cancer in China infected with COVID-19 (ChiCTR200002806). However, whether the possibility of PD-1 inhibitorerelated pneumonia and potential risk of cytokine-release syndrome would aggravate underlying infections remain unknown [14] , as does the interplay here of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. An artificial intelligence (AI)ederived knowledge graph indicated that the JAK1 inhibitor baricitinib may help in preventing viral entry via inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis [15] , as well as inhibiting downstream cytokines [16] ; it is notable that those data revealed a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as being potentially useful too, but the authors immediately considered them too toxic.",
