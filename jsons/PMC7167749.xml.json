In addition, 23 children (29%) were exposed to furry animals (i.e. cat and/or dog at home or at day care) in infancy, and the early animal exposure led to sensitization (i.e. skin prick test positivity to the animal in question by school age) in four cases and to tolerance in 19 cases. At the index hospitalization for wheezing in infancy, 16 (29%) had elevated total serum IgE (\u226560 kU/L), and 25 children (32%) had eosinophilia (\u22650.45 \u00d7 10\n9\n cells/L).

Heredity of asthma, female gender, and in utero exposure to tobacco smoke predicted subnormal lung function parameters; and rhinovirus infection\u2010induced wheeze in infancy and early animal exposure leading to sensitization predicted increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise at school age.

Such a finding is unique, because the role of viruses other than RSV on later lung function and bronchial responsiveness is poorly studied. We found three studies comparing outcomes of RSV\u2010positive and RSV\u2010negative infants with bronchiolitis: in these studies no differences in lung function or airway responsiveness were found at the age of 7 years\n5\n, \n22\n or later.\n29\n The authors did not specify the viral etiology of wheeze in RSV\u2010negative children, and the role of rhinoviruses, for instance, remained open. Rhinoviruses, however, are commonly encountered in wheezing children in early childhood,\n28\n and often precipitate asthma symptoms in school children.\n30\n In addition, studies on experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have reported increased airway responsiveness in allergic subjects compared with non\u2010allergic ones,\n31\n and significantly reduced FEV1 in home recordings by patients with mild atopic asthma.\n32\n We could not find, however, any previous follow\u2010up studies on lung function and/or bronchial responsiveness after rhinovirus infection\u2010induced wheezing in infancy.",
