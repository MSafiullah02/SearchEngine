Planners, governments, and agencies are scrambling to \u2026gure out \"How much? How bad? \" and how to e\u00a4ectively treat the potentially large numbers of simultaneously sick people. Modeling the CoVID-19 pandemic using an exponential rise implicitly assumes a nearly unlimited population of uninfected persons (\"dilute pandemic\"). Once a signi\u2026cant fraction of the population is infected (\"saturated pandemic\"), an exponential growth no longer applies. A new model is developed here, which modi\u2026es the standard exponential growth function to account for factors such as Social Distancing. A Social Mitigation Parameter [SMP] S is introduced to account for these types of society-wide changes, which can modify the standard exponential growth function, as follows:",

It also provides estimates for: (a) the timing of the pandemic peak, (b) the maximum number of new daily cases that would be expected, and (c) the expected total number of CoVID-19 cases. This model shows fairly good agreement",

Figure 4 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in California. Only data after 3/21/2020 was included in the analysis, after California Governor Gavin Newsom instituted mandatory Mitigation Measures.

Figure 5 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in New York. A relatively high SMP estimate of S 0:1031=day was found, coupled with a relatively short initial doubling-time of t initial dbl 0:9395 days, which creates a high narrow spike in daily new cases.

The predicted total number of cases at~1; 218; 000 , giving a projected~6:072% \u2026nal infection rate. Figure 6 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in Washington State. An initial doubling-time of t initial dbl 2:189 days and an SMP value of S 0:0687=day were found, with a projected pandemic peak around 6/04/2020. The relatively low number of cases at the Mitigation Measures start helps to give a predicted total number of cases of~557; 600, corresponding to \u00e3 7:15% \u2026nal infection rate. Figure 7 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in Illinois. An initial doubling-time of t initial dbl 2:457 days and moderate SMP value of S 0:0373=day combine to give a projected pandemic peak around 6/04/2020, similar to Washington State, but having a higher predicted total number of cases at~1; 277; 000 , and a projected~11:47% \u2026nal infection rate. Figure 8 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in Florida. Many Florida counties instituted their own Mitigation Measures prior to a state-wide lockdown, slowing CoVID-19 growth. A somewhat high SMP value of S 0:0526=day, and an initial doubling-time of t initial dbl 1:494 days results. A pandemic peak is estimated at around 5/20/2020, with a predicted total number of cases at~1; 090; 000 , and a projected~4:96% \u2026nal infection rate. Figure 9 shows model predictions of CoVID-19 evolution for the whole World. The present-day doubling-time value of t initial dbl 5:761 days likely represents a combination of small urban, large urban, and rural area results. However, the calculated low SMP estimate of S 0:01712=day shows that nearly~4:43% of the World's population could be at risk for eventual CoVID-19 infection. At these present levels, the projected pandemic peak is around 8/15/2020, with potentially hundreds of millions of people being infected. Figure 10 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in China, covering their \"\u2026rst wave\" of early exposure and early mitigation. Data were included that was prior to a \"New Reporting Method \" being used, which started o\u00a4 with one sudden data jump, and nearly level CoVID-19 follow-on results. The present model predicts what number of cases could have resulted, had the reporting method not changed. Draconian Mitigation Measures helped to contain the pandemic to Hubei Province and Wuhan. These projections show that those Mitigation Measures have impressively contained CoVID-19 spread. Figure 11 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in South Korea, covering the period of their country's early exposure and initial mitigation methods. Pre-pandemic Mitigation Measures, including extensive contact-tracing and large-scale CoVID-19 testing, were implemented. These projections show that those Mitigation Measures, as an alternative to China's methods, also have impressively contained CoVID-19 spread.

Figure 13 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in Germany. The relatively high SMP estimate of S 0:07614=day with an initial doublingtime of t initial dbl 1:4177 days combine to give a projected pandemic peak at around 4/08/2020, with a predicted total number of cases of~700; 100 , and a projected~0:84% \u2026nal infection rate. These values would make Germany one of the less impacted countries in Europe. They represent predicted \u2026nal CoVID-19 infection rates that are signi\u2026cantly lower than the original 60% 70% early worst-case estimates highlighted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Figure 14 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in Spain. An SMP estimate of S 0:07058=day, which is comparable to Germany, and a smaller initial doubling-time of t initial dbl 1:1778 days combine to give more predicted CoVID-19 cases than Germany.

Figure 15 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in Ecuador. Reports of chaos in Ecuador have been alarming. Yet the present data show a signi\u2026cant and somewhat unexpected leveling o\u00a4 in the number of reported CoVID-19 cases. This result could mean that some as yet unknown Mitigation Measures may be operating. Alternatively, the data could mean that there is a dire CoVID-19 testing and reporting shortfall operating amidst the chaos. Figure 16 shows model predictions for CoVID-19 evolution in India. These initial data show virtually no mitigation at present, having one of the lowest calculated SMP estimates of S 0:0148=day, with an initial doubling-time of t initial dbl 3:135 days. At this rate, nearly 17:38% of the population of India could eventually become infected. The estimated pandemic peak is around 5/30/2021, which would be 441 days after the \u2026rst CoVID-19 fatality was reported, on 3/14/2020. Additional Mitigation Measures, further increasing the {t dbl ; S } values, as well as adding in additional modeling parameters may signi\u2026cantly reduce these projected number of CoVID-19 cases.",
