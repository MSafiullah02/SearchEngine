While the power consumption is relatively low in this method, it requires a complicated fabrication process to integrate the thin film heater and RTD on the same chip. Peltier heat block technology is also widely used for both static and continuous\u2010flow PCR due to its rapid heating and cooling rates, but this technology also requires higher power consumption.21, 22 In continuous\u2010flow PCR, PCR amplification occurs when the reaction samples pass through discrete temperature zones.23, 24 This method can produce faster thermal cycling than can static PCR, but it requires an external syringe pump for flow control and lacks the capability to change the number of cycles. Another approach includes infrared (IR)\u2010mediated noncontact selective heating of the PCR mixture for PCR thermal cycling using an IR laser or filament lamp, which harnesses water's strong IR absorbance property at wavelengths greater than 1000 nm.25, 26 However, as the volume of the PCR mixture increases from nanoliter to microliter, the total thermal cycling time also increases from \u22485 to \u224840 min.",

More recently, we have introduced a novel ultrafast photonic PCR method that combines a thin Au film as a plasmonic photothermal light\u2010to\u2010heat converter and light\u2010emitting diodes (LEDs) as a heat source.29 In comparison to AuNPs\u2010based fast PCR, the plasmonic photothermal heating of microfabricated Au thin film for ultrafast photonic PCR has many advantages since microfabrication technology can provide precise geometrical controls, accurate thin film thickness process, enabling novel integrated devices, and reproducible microdevices. In this method, the 120 nm thick Au film on the bottom of the reaction well generates heat due to its strong absorption of the light from a 3 W blue LED, resulting in the heating of the surrounding solution to 150 \u00b0C within 3 min, as well as the ultrafast completion of 30 thermal cycles within 5 min. While this method is promising for POC diagnostics due to its ultrafast thermal cycling ability, low power consumption, and simple configuration for system integration, we need to improve its relatively low amplification efficiency. In order to accomplish accurate and reliable PCR\u2010based diagnostics, we have to solve the issues of temperature gradient in the PCR mixture caused by heating only on one side and the reliable positioning of the thermocouple for temperature control.",

By employing an optical cavity consisting of two thin Au films for evenly absorbed light, the temperature uniformity of the PCR mixture is greatly improved, showing a temperature difference of less than 2 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C and 0.2 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C. Depending on the PCR reaction volume from 1.3 to 10 \u03bcL, 30 thermal cycles from 94 \u00b0C to 68 \u00b0C can be accomplished within 4\u201310 min. The temperature variations during 30 thermal cycles are below 1 \u00b0C for both 94 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C, showing precision temperature controllability. Nucleic acids (c\u2010MET cDNA) at concentrations as low as 10\u22128 ng \u03bcL\u22121 (two copies per \u03bcL) were successfully amplified using the LED\u2010driven optical cavity PCR, with high repeatability and reproducibility.

            "text": "\nFigure\n\n1\na shows a schematic of light absorption in the optical cavity PCR for nucleic acid amplification with PCR. The optical cavity comprises two thin Au films on the top (denoted as Au film2 in Figure 1a) and bottom (denoted as Au film1 in Figure 1a) of the PCR cavity, both of which were deposited on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sheet. The two Au films act as a plasmonic photothermal light\u2010to\u2010heat converter for PCR thermal cycling, as previously reported.29 When the LED is illuminated, the emitted light is reflected, absorbed, and transmitted to Au film1. Subsequently, the transmitted light is also reflected, absorbed, and transmitted to Au film2. The reflected light on Au film2 exhibits multiple reflections, absorptions, and transmissions in the optical cavity. Based on this model, the total absorption of Au film1 and film2 are given by \u2211Afilm1=I0A1(1+T1R21\u2212R1R2) and \u2211Afilm2=I0A2(T11\u2212R1R2), where I\n0 is the initial intensity of the light from the LED and A\n1 (and A\n2), T\n1 (and T\n2), and R\n1 (and R\n2) are the absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance of Au film1 (and film2), respectively. The thicknesses of the Au films were optimized to obtain uniform light absorption by both Au films (\u2211Afilm1=\u2211Afilm2) for the greatest uniform temperature distribution as well as the greatest total light absorption (\u2211Afilm1+\u2211Afilm2). First, the average transmittance, reflectance, and absorbance of thin Au films over the emission wavelength of the LED was calculated from the measured absorption spectra of thin Au films with different thicknesses and based on the emission spectrum of the LED (Figure S1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). Then, the absorption ratio (\u2211Afilm1/\u2211Afilm2) and total absorption (\u2211Afilm1+\u2211Afilm2) were calculated for different combinations of top and bottom Au thicknesses, as shown in Table\n\n1\n. The combination of a 10 nm thick Au film1 and a 120 nm thick Au film2 was optimal for both the absorption ratio (1.06) and the total absorption of light (70%); hence, these values were used as the thicknesses of the thin Au films for the optical cavity PCR chamber. For the nucleic acid amplification through PCR, thermal cycling, consisting of two or three discrete temperatures for denaturation, annealing, and extension can be achieved by simply turning on and off the heat source LED (Figure 1b). Figure 1d shows a schematic of the LED\u2010driven optical cavity PCR. A reference chamber with a type\u2010K thermocouple was placed next to the optical cavity PCR chamber. The reference and cavity PCR chambers were designed to be covered by the beam waist (\u00f8 12 mm) at the focal length to ensure that both chambers receive the same intensity of light so that photothermal heating occurs at the same rate. Both chambers were placed at the focal length of the lens (25 mm from the top surface of the lens) for the highest light absorption. The photograph for the experimental setup of the LED\u2010driven optical cavity PCR can be found in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. An optical cavity PCR device can be designed with multiple cavities to allow for multiplexed PCR.",

            "text": "We performed a set of heat transfer simulations using COMSOL to theoretically characterize the temperature uniformity inside the optical cavity during PCR thermal cycling (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Figure\n\n2\na\u2013d shows the calculated temperature distribution inside the 750 \u03bcm thick PCR chamber for bottom\u2010only and cavity (top and bottom) heating at 94 \u00b0C (for denaturation) and 68 \u00b0C (for annealing/extension). It is clear that cavity heating provides a more uniform temperature distribution compared with bottom\u2010only heating, especially at 94 \u00b0C. The temperature gradients across the height of the chamber (along the white arrow) are plotted in Figure 2e. The cavity heating shows better temperature uniformity, with a difference of only 1.9 \u00b0C and 0.2 \u00b0C compared to the temperature difference of 14.4 \u00b0C and 0.4 \u00b0C for bottom\u2010only heating at 94 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C, respectively. The effect of the PCR chamber height on the temperature uniformity was also investigated, as shown in Figure 2f. As the height of the PCR chamber decreases, the temperature difference (\u2206T = T\nmax \u2212 T\nmin) across the height of the chamber decreases for both the bottom\u2010only and cavity heating configurations because heat transfer can be more effective in the smaller volume of a thinner PCR chamber. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the cavity heating shows significantly smaller temperature differences for all chamber heights at both the denaturation and annealing/extension temperatures. Therefore, employing cavity heating allows for uniform heating of the PCR mixture for efficient and reliable nucleic acid amplification.",

The total time to achieve 30 PCR cycles decreases as the cavity height decreases, attaining the minimum time (average 235.5 s) with a 100 \u03bcm thick cavity PCR chamber, which shows good linearity with an adjusted R2 value of 0.9899, as shown in Figure 3b (Figure S4, Supporting Information, for the total time in the case of bottom\u2010only heating). Using the thermal cycling result, heating and cooling rates were calculated as previously described.28, 29 The average rates during 30 PCR cycles and sample standard deviations were obtained, as shown in Figure 3c. The fastest heating and cooling rates of 7.50 \u00b1 0.46 \u00b0C and 6.35 \u00b1 0.49 \u00b0C s\u22121 were obtained from the 100 \u03bcm thick PCR chamber. The maximum and minimum temperatures attained during each PCR cycle varied within less than 1 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C and less than 0.5 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C, showing comparable temperature accuracy to commercially available benchtop thermal cyclers. In particular, due to the lower heat mass as well as fast heat transfer between the thin Au film and the PCR mixture through a 50 nm thick SiO2 layer, the overshoot and undershoot for the cavity PCR were very low (0.85 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C, 0.25 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C) compared to the benchtop thermal cycler (\u22482 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C, \u22484 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C) when fast cycling was performed because the benchtop thermal cycler is not designed for fast thermal cycling (Figure S5, Supporting Information). To ensure that both chambers at position 1 (reference chamber) and position 2 (optical cavity PCR chamber) were heated at the same rate, a reference chamber with a type\u2010K thermocouple was placed at both positions and thermal cycling was performed. Figure 3e shows a comparison of the temperature profiles during thermal cycling between positions 1 and 2. From this figure, it can clearly be observed that both positions received the same intensity of light from the LED for the photothermal heating of thin Au films (Figure S6, Supporting Information).",

For the benchtop PCR, a three\u2010step thermal cycling protocol recommended by the manufacturer was used (Figure S7, Supporting Information). It is clear that as the cycle number is increased, the intensity of the band increases for the cavity PCR. The cavity PCR with a different chamber height (200, 400, and 750 \u03bcm thicknesses) was performed as shown in Figure 4b. For the comparison, the same volume of PCR byproducts from different chamber heights was used for gel electrophoresis as diluted to 20 \u03bcL volume due to the small PCR sample volume for the 200 \u03bcm thick cavity chamber. It is noteworthy that the gel intensity from the 200 \u03bcm thick cavity PCR chamber is low, and this may be attributed to the faster cycling time and subsequently lower amplification efficiency. By optimizing the PCR reagents, the amplification efficiency can be further improved. The total reaction times for both the benchtop and cavity PCR are summarized in Figure 4c. A reduction of 70%\u201385% in total reaction time can be obtained using cavity PCR, although the total reaction times for the KAPA2G Fast PCR kit are already 20%\u201370% shorter than for the conventional PCR assay. Figure 4d shows the 2% agarose gel image from the cavity PCR with different initial concentrations of template DNA. There is a clear trend in the change in band intensity as the concentration changes. Furthermore, 40 cycles of cavity PCR were able to amplify as low as 10\u22128 ng \u03bcL\u22121 (two copies per \u03bcL\u22121) within 15 min. We also successfully amplified the c\u2010MET cDNA prepared from nonsmall cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC, H1975) to show the utility of the optical cavity PCR method for the heterogeneous biological samples as shown in Figure 4e. In addition to its fast and sensitive nucleic acid amplification, the cavity PCR is highly repeatable and reproducible. The cavity PCR was performed in series with different concentration of template DNA as shown in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. The success rate of the cavity PCR with different concentrations of initial template DNA is plotted in Figure 4f to show the excellent repeatability and reproducibility of the cavity PCR method. The success rate for extremely low concentrations can be further improved with a mass\u2010manufactured cavity PCR chamber. The cavity PCR was also successfully operated by minimally trained undergraduate students (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The demonstration of the robust LED\u2010driven optical cavity PCR indicates that this method is an ideal candidate for implementation into POC platforms that require fast, accurate, and reliable nucleic acid amplification.",

            "text": "The optical cavity PCR used in this study was effective in not only fast PCR thermal cycling but also reliable nucleic acid amplification, yielding results comparable to the conventional benchtop PCR system. Providing the test results within 30 min is necessary to make a single visit to the POC viable.11 Our cavity PCR can meet this requirement because it can accomplish 30 PCR thermal cycles within 4\u201310 min and can amplify nucleic acid concentrations as low as 10\u22128 ng \u03bcL\u22121 (two copies per \u03bcL) within 15 min. By optimizing the thickness of the thin Au films of the cavity, light absorption can be uniformly absorbed at the top and bottom thin Au layers of the cavity, resulting in excellent temperature uniformity with a difference of only 1.9 \u00b0C and 0.2 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C, respectively. As a result, cavity PCR shows excellent repeatability and reproducibility due to its excellent temperature uniformity and precise temperature accuracy. In general, the faster the thermal cycling is driven, the greater the variation of the temperature across the PCR sample will be, due to thermal inertia.11 However, in the optical cavity PCR, there is not a significant difference in the temperature accuracy with different sample volumes, ranging from 1.3 to 10 \u03bcL. This could be due to not only the low thermal mass but also the fast heat transfer between the thin Au film and the PCR mixture through the ultrathin 50 nm thick SiO2 passivation layer. At present, the power consumption for heating is relatively high (\u224820 W) compared to previous work (\u22483 W)29 because seven LEDs on a single PCB were chosen to have a wide beam waist for heating the reference and cavity PCR chambers at the same rate. However, by using two 3 W LEDs for each reference and cavity PCR chamber, the power consumption could be further reduced (\u22486 W). Our current efforts are focused on real\u2010time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using fluorescent detection as well as integrating multiple wells to allow for high\u2010throughput multiplexed amplification. Although the gel electrophoresis is considered as one of the gold standards for the analysis of PCR byproduct from conventional PCR, the result would not be completely quantitative, and additional steps are required. Therefore, the fluorescent detection for the real\u2010time qPCR is highly required, and we are investigating the real\u2010time optical cavity PCR method for quantitative analysis. For the high\u2010throughput multiplexed amplification, a LED array for the simultaneous heating of multiple wells can be used, but this also can increase the power consumption. To challenge the power consumption issue for multiple wells applications, optimization for the size of the cavity PCR chamber and uniform light distribution from the LED array to ensure simultaneous heating of multiple wells should be considered as our future work.",

The top layer was incubated in an oven at 56 \u00b0C for 6 h to allow for annealing of the damaged regions sustained from laser cutting.

Forward primer (5\u2032\u2010GGACTGCAGCAGCAAAGCCAATTT\u20103\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032\u2010TGTTGACGCTGCCACAGCTAATGA\u20103\u2032) for a 116 base pair (bp) c\u2010MET amplicon were purchased from Integrated DNA technologies. For the conventional benchtop PCR with recommended concentrations, the PCR reaction consisted of 0.08 \u03bcL KAPA2G DNA polymerase, 4 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 KAPA2G buffer A, 0.4 \u03bcL dNTP mixture, 1 \u03bcL each forward and reverse c\u2010MET primers (stock solution 10 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), 6.7 \u03bcL bovine serum albumin (BSA) (3% w/v stock solution for a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121 BSA) and 2 \u03bcL template cDNA. Water was added to bring the final volume to 20 \u03bcL. To increase the amplification efficiency in the fast cycling cavity PCR, high concentrations of polymerase and primers were used, as previously reported.30, 31 The PCR reaction for the cavity PCR consisted of 0.4 \u03bcL KAPA2G DNA polymerase, 2 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7 KAPA2G buffer A, 0.2 \u03bcL dNTP mixture, 1 \u03bcL each forward and reverse c\u2010MET primers (stock solution 100 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), 3.3 \u03bcL of BSA (3% w/v stock solution for a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg \u03bcL\u22121 BSA) and 1 \u03bcL of template DNA. Again, water was added until the reaction was brought to a final volume of 10 \u03bcL. The concentration of c\u2010MET cDNA also varied and was brought to as low as 10\u22128 ng \u03bcL\u22121 (two copies per \u03bcL). A Bio\u2010Rad C1000 thermal cycler with CFX96 real\u2010time PCR detection system was used for the reference PCR system. PCR was performed at a volume of 20 \u03bcL for the benchtop and 2.5, 5, and 10 \u03bcL for the cavity PCR with different chamber thicknesses. The PCR mixture was loaded into the optical cavity PCR chamber using a pipette until the inlet on the other side of the chamber had filled with fluid, ensuring that no air bubbles would be formed during thermal cycling. The two inlets were sealed with PCR sealing tape to ensure that no bubble formed or to prevent the loss of fluid. The cavity PCR chamber was placed in line with the reference chamber with the 120 nm thick Au film on top, because this is the optimal configuration for uniform light absorption and the maximum total absorption of the thin Au films. After amplification, a mixture of 10 \u03bcL of PCR byproduct (collected from the cavity PCR chamber using a pipette) and 10 \u03bcL of E\u2010Gel sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) were loaded onto E\u2010Gel 2% agarose gels with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) and run in an E\u2010Gel iBase Power System (Invitrogen). A gel image was taken with an E\u2010Gel Safe Imager Transilluminator. A 50bp DNA ladder was used to confirm the size of the product. For the preparation of heterogeneous biological sample, RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) was used to extract total RNA from NSCLC, H1975. Briefly, the cells were lysed in the 350 \u03bcL RLT Plus Buffer containing 7 \u03bcL of 2 m dithiothreitol (DTT) by pipetting vigorously for 1 min. The homogenized lysate was transferred into the gDNA eliminator spin column and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 30 s. The RNA in the aqueous phase was mixed with 350 \u03bcL of 70% ethanol and transferred into an RNeasy Mini spin column. The precipitated RNA was captured in the column by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 30 s and washed with 700 \u03bcL of RW1 Buffer, followed by washing twice with 500 \u03bcL of RPE Buffer. To elute the purified total RNA captured in the membrane of column, 42 \u03bcL of RNase\u2010free water was added directly to the spin column membrane and collected in a clean tube by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 1 min. Afterward, the extracted total RNA was reverse transcribed with iScript reverse transcription supermix for RT\u2013qPCR (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The concentration of c\u2010MET cDNA from NSCLC cell was measured around 10\u22123 ng \u03bcL\u22121 by comparing threshold cycle (C\nt) value obtained via qPCR. For PCR amplification, the sample was diluted ten times and used instead of c\u2010MET cDNA purchased from Sino Biological Inc. In addition to c\u2010MET cDNA, \u03bb\u2010DNA was also used as a template for PCR for initial cavity PCR optimization. The \u03bb\u2010DNA and Takara Z\u2010Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 U \u03bcL\u22121), 10\u00d7 Z\u2010Taq Buffer (Mg2+ plus, 30 \u00d7 10\u22123\nm) and dNTP Mixture (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123\nm each) were purchased from Takara Bio Company.
