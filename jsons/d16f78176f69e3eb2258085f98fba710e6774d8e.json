Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.

All viruses mentioned above can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, as well as overlapping clinical presentations, making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without a solid laboratory analysis. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as viral culture and direct/indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), are time-consuming and labor intensive with limited sensitivity. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses can help in epidemiologic monitoring, along with taking effective prevention steps and implementing appropriate antiviral therapies. Over the past decades, an evolution in viral diagnostic testing has been seen, all the way from conventional approaches to rapid antigen detection. More recently, highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and point-of-care tests (POCT) have been developed. 2 In this review, we describe various approaches currently available, or under development, for diagnosis of common respiratory virus infections in humans. It is anticipated that these data will assist clinical laboratories to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory viruses, thus providing physicians with essential information for timely and appropriate treatment of patients. The commonly used diagnostic approaches for influenza virus, RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail in the following review. 15 The immunofluorescence assay can rapidly detect RSV antigens using a fluorescence-tagged primary or secondary antibody. Also, this assay is more sensitive than RT-PCT. By probing F and G proteins with QDs, confocal microscopy could detect the progression of RSV infection in the HEp-2 cell line, and this method was found to be more sensitive compared to RT-PCR. 18 Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is another rapid RSV detection method based on an immunochromatographic technique using the samples of nasal washes or aspirates. Many LFIA kits are now available in the market, such as BD Directigen EZ RSV, Binax Now RSV, RSV Respi-Strip, Remel Xpect, and QuickLab RSV Test.

Human adenovirus (hAdV) infections are readily transmittable, infecting all age groups, especially infants and the elderly, as well as those with immunodeficiency and organ transplantation. 59 HAdV has a non-enveloped spherical structure with a diameter of 70 to 100 nm. The external shell consists of 252 capsomeres, including 240 hexons and 12 pentons, which are composed of an icosahedral viral capsid. The capsomeres are arranged on 20 triangular surfaces, making the shell form 30 edges and 12 vertices. The genome of hAdV exists in the capsid in the form of linear double-stranded DNA with sizes ranging from 34 to more than 37 kb. The genome contains the early expressed E1~E4 genes associated with replication of hAdV, intermediate gene of \u2168 and \u2163a2,and late region genes L1~L5 associated with the production of mature virions.60 HAdV belongs to the Adenoviridae family, and it has been classified into seven species (A to G) with over 50 serotypes based on hexon and fiber protein characteristics, relative nucleic homology, immunochemical responses, biological properties, and phylogenetic relationships.35,61,62 This subdivision has some clinical relevance, essentially because different hAdVs differ in tissue orientation and disease type. HAdV can cause multiple diseases, -A, -B, and -D). 59,63 Therefore, effective and rapid diagnosis of hAdV ahead of its progression will provide for effective monitoring of hAdV infection and guarantee timely and effective treatment of hAdVassociated diseases.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "standard.\"36 Samples, such as throat swabs and stool specimen,collected from patients are treated overnight with antibiotics, centrifuged, and supernatant inoculated with susceptible cells (Hep-2, Graham 293, or A549).

The serotype of hAdV can be determined by detecting the antigenic determinant of penton proteins by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. HAdV can also be typed by detecting the antigenic determinant of hexon proteins by neutralizing test (NT). However, these methods are time-consuming, require experienced technicians to analyze the results, and the results are still uncertain. Different types of hAdV infection can cause different diseases and different symptoms; thus, detection of antigens and antibodies can make the diagnosis of hAdV more rapid and sensitive. Indirect ELISA can detect the IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies of hAdV in human serum or plasma.

Timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections. Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review. However, these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment. All of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans. Therefore, the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential. However, efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on high-throughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using Sanger sequencing. Although this approach has been fruitful, the cost and throughput of Sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the~22 000 genes that make up the exome. The recent development of NGS technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes, transcriptomes, and genomes at relatively low cost. The application of NGS in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular. NGS exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods. As an infrequently circulating genotype, genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity, and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus.
