Factors that may be implicated in this association include variations in light exposure and the incidence of viral infections, such as influenza. Replicated data from ecological studies show a seasonal peak of suicide in the spring (Postolache et al., 2010) , which is even more pronounced in individuals with a history of mood disorders. It is also largely recognized the existence of an overlap between the peak of viral respiratory infections and the suicide rates, but methodological caveats prevent definitive causeeffect conclusions.",

It is necessary not only because mood disorders are highly prevalent, but also because the use of antiinflammatory interventions is a promising but still underexplored treatment strategy. In this point of view, we speculate about some few insights that the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially offer to the scientific community to be further fully explored.",

The naturalist observation of the individuals with COVID-19 infection, further use of antidepressants as well as admissions and visits due to suicide attempts offers a unique opportunity to go from the ecological designs to cohort studies, which are much more methodologically powerful. Furthermore, as one could speculate that the immune response to viruses may create a vulnerability to mood episodes in some subpopulations, the assessment of serum titters for COVID-19 might be an important tool to be integrated into research in neuropsychoimmunology of depression, in the same way it was recently done with cytomegalovirus.",

Chloroquine has shown to have antiviral activity in vitro and hydroxychloroquine was effective in reducing the viral carriage on day 6 of treatment (Gautret et al., 2020) . In addition, azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was even more efficient for reduction of the amount of virus (Gautret et al., 2020) . The mechanisms involved in antimalarial immunomodulatory activity have intrigued immunologists for years (Schrezenmeir and Dorner 2020). They act in multiple molecular targets but seem to have a unique property of modulating lysosomal activity and interfering with autophagy. Interestingly, Major Depression Disorder (MDD) has been associated with increased or dysregulated autophagy in some critical regions such as the hippocampi and there is some evidence from animal studies that at least part of the effect of different antidepressants can be exerted by the stabilization of lysosomal activity (Gulbins et al., 2018) . Similarly, azithromycin and other macrolides antibiotics also had shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. Interestingly, azithromycin was also very efficient in inhibiting depressive-like behaviors in animal models of inflammation-induced depression, also reducing the levels of classic proinflammatory cytokines (Hao et al., 2013) . Together, this evidence suggests that medications potentially useful to modulate the immune system in order to make the organism more resilient to COVID-19 also represent an opportunity to repurpose drugs as antidepressants.",

Data supporting this view came from the documentation of increase of subpopulations of senescent T lymphocytes, a predominance of memory cells, the relative lack of na\u00efve T cells, an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and shortening of telomeres in individuals with mood disorders(Rizzo et al., 2018). One of the strategies for investigating the immune system function in individuals with mood disorders is to observe their response to injected antigenic substances such as endotoxin. The outbreak of a viral infection is a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of an acute immune challenge on different domains of the psychopathology of mood disorders.",
