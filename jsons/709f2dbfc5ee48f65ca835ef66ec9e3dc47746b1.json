Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the insights from the model.",

The geographic and temporal clustering of outbreaks have the potential to create a health care system collapse. Many states in the United States have imposed \"stay at home\" orders to contain the spread of the disease.

After observing many deaths in Italy, many experts and government officials are concerned about the number of available ventilators. Patients who become critically ill need individual ventilators but they have become a scarce resource. Equally important resources are medical specialists and staff members that can supervise the patients in their beds and operate the ventilators properly. Fundamentally, this paper strives to help healthcare managers understand what supply is needed for all these lifesaving resources at the peak of the ultimate curve for their aggregate demand.",

There are two important reasons to begin with the M t /G/\u221e queueing model even though it has an infinite number of servers and this does not seem realistic from a practical perspective. The first reason is that the M t /G/\u221e queue is very tractable since the distribution is known in closed form for any non-stationary arrival rate. The second reason is that the M t /G/\u221e queue is the best type of queue one can hope for where everyone is immediately served and no one ever waits for service. From the perspective of the COVID-19 epidemic, this means that anyone who wants a bed gets a bed immediately or who ever needs a ventilator gets a ventilator immediately. In this regard, the M t /G/\u221e infinite server queue is an upper bound for queueing models with a finite number of servers and without abandonment since it represents the dynamics if the manager had access to an infinite amount of resources and is not resource constrained. Moreover, the infinite server queue has a history of being used to staff finite server systems, see for example Jennings et al. [12] , Feldman et al. [7] , Liu and Whitt [15] , Massey and Pender [16] . Thus, the infinite server queue serves as the first step to understanding more complicated systems.",

On the left of the both Figures 3 -4 , we plot the actual arrival rate and the actual queue length; however ,on the right of Figures 3 -4, we plot the actual queue length, but an arrival rate that is scaled by the mean service time E[S]. We observe that the in the unscaled plots on the left, the arrival rate does not intersect with the queue length at the peak. However, in the scaled plots on the right, we observe that the arrival rate intersects with the queue length curve at the queue length peak. This verifies Equation 2.16 again. Finally, we observe in Table 1 that by reducing the arrival rate peak by one half reduces the queue length peak by one half when E[S] = 1. However, we observe in Tables 2 -3 that as we increase E[S], we see a smaller reduction in the peak queue length.

One immediately can tell these countries apart since the confirmed cases start earlier in China, then South Korea, then Italy, and then finally the United States. We also observe that as of April 16th, it appears that the United States has hit its peak and is on its way down. On each of the plots, we also overlay a Gaussian and gamma distribution function to get a sense what distribution parameters best fit the data. For China, the best Gaussian fit was a Gaussian(\u03bb * = 314101, \u03c4 = 23, \u03c3 = 8.28) and the best gamma fit was a Gamma(\u03bb * = 369218, \u03b1 = 6.75, \u03b2 = .25). For South Korea, the best Gaussian fit was a Gaussian(\u03bb * = 34914, \u03c4 = 42, \u03c3 = 16.37) and the best gamma fit was a Gamma(\u03bb * = 31220, \u03b1 = 9.4, \u03b2 = .2). For Italy, the best Gaussian fit was a Gaussian(\u03bb * = 440393, \u03c4 = 60, \u03c3 = 26.79) and the best gamma fit was a Gamma(\u03bb * = 340126, \u03b1 = 9.57, \u03b2 = .15).

In Figure 8 , we plot the arrivals and deaths per day from January 22nd to April 16th normalized by their maximum value (arrival = black dots, deaths = red dots). For China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States, the maximum confirmed infections was (15, 136) , (851), (6557), and (35,098) respectively. Moreover, for China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States, the maximum confirmed deaths was (252), (11), (919), and (4591) respectively. We observe that for most all countries except Italy, the largest number of deaths lags the largest number of confirmed infections. This is the lag effect that we observe in our queueing models.

This insight provides a mechanism through the standard deviation parameter \u03c3 to control the peak number of hospitalized people. However, the effectiveness of social distancing on flattening the curve, i.e. increasing \u03c3, remains an open question. As a result, in order to avoid overcrowding flattening should be inversely proportional to the amount of hospital capacity. Additionally, we find that flattening the curve has a smaller impact on the peak number of patients when the service times are long. This means the longer patients stay in the hospital, the more society must flatten the curve in order to achieve the same capacity level. In the three examples with an exponential service distribution and a Gaussian arrival rate, we flattened the peak arrival rate by 50%, however, we see that the peak queue length was reduced by 47%, 42%, 23% respectively for E[S] = {1,2,10}. For the gamma arrival rate setting, we see that a 33% reduction in the peak arrival rate, we obtain a 31% and 16% reduction respectively for E[S] = {1,10}.",

First, we show that the peak number of infected lags behind the peak number of new infected individuals. Surprisingly, there is a nonlinear relationship between flattening the curve and the time lag between the peak rate of newly admitted patients and the peak demand for hospital resources (Theorem 2.2).

            "text": "In this paper, we present a simple infinite server queueing model of the number of infected people with Covid-19. This analysis can be used to understand how many people will become infected, need a hospital bed, or need a ventilator. We show how the dynamics of the number infected explicitly depends on the arrival rate function. We explore two arrival rate functions. The first is symmetric and is given by a Gaussian distribution function and the second is is asymmetric and is given by a gamma distribution function. We explicitly calculate the time of the peak queue length, the peak queue length, and its dependence on the duration of infection. Despite the insights derived in this paper, this is not the whole story and many questions still remain. In what follows, we outline some of the important questions that still remain and need to be studied. By leveraging operations research tools and techniques, hospitals have prided themselves on the efficiency that comes with just-in-time supply management and minimizing empty beds, thus saving on hospital costs. However as a result, they are often not equipped for an epidemic surge such as this one. Despite our efforts to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, there is plenty of additional research that needs to be done in order to understand emerging complexities. One area of importance is to understand the effects of surges in arrivals into the healthcare system. Some recent research has studied queueing models with self-exciting point processes that model random surges in demand, see for example Daw and Pender [1, 2, 3] , Pender [21] , Niyirora and Pender [20] , Massey and Pender [18] . These types of models would generalize our model in this paper, but, they are more complicated and would disguise the easy to understand insights from simpler models.",

[22] . Also in NYC, it has been reported that COVID-19 is impacting low-income communities much harder than those that are well off Wilson [24] . Recent work by Kahara and Pender [13] combines queueing theory with demographic information to get a deeper understanding of blood donation dynamics and it is clear that similar demographic analyses are also needed to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on marginalized populations.",

Unlike the Erlang distribution it allows for more variability and has more variance than the exponential distribution. Usually the hyper-exponential distribution is determined by two M-dimensional vectors of parameters (p 1 , p 2 , ..., p n ) and (\u00b5 1 , \u00b5 2 , ..., \u00b5 n ). The vector (p 1 , p 2 , ..., p n ) represents the probabilistic weights of each exponential distribution and the vector (\u00b5 1 , \u00b5 2 , ..., \u00b5 n ) is the associated vector of rate parameters for each exponential distribution. Thus, the hyper-exponential is a convex combination of exponential distributions with different rate parameters.Corollary 6.3. The M t /H n /\u221e queue with arrival rate given by a Gaussian distribution with parameters has the following closed form expression for the mean transient queue lengthProof. This follows from the fact that the hyper-exponential is just a thinning of a Poisson process. Thus, the sum is also a Poisson process with the sum of the rates.Corollary 6.4. The M t /H n /\u221e queue with arrival rate given by a Gaussian distribution with parameters has the following closed form expression for the lagProof. This follows from the fact that the hyper-exponential is just a thinning of a Poisson process. Thus, the sum is also a Poisson process with the sum of the rates. Moreover, the stationary excess distribution of a hyper-exponential is another hyper-exponential distribution with modified rates.",
