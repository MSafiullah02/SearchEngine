Infection with this virus has become a serious issue in the swine industry and outbreaks have lead to serious economic losses in many countries (Hofmann and Wyler, 1987). Unfortunately, now there are no effective commercial vaccines or specific treatments available and the only measures to control the disease are those directed to preventing the entrance of the virus on the farm.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) is effective in treating anaphylaxis and cancer (Kwon et al., 2003, Li et al., 2005, Lu et al., 2006). It has also been shown that the essential oil prepared from fresh plants of H. cordata possessed direct inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), without showing cytotoxicity (Lu et al., 2006). In particular, quercetin, a flavonoid present in H. cordata, has been reported to have inhibitory effects on several viruses (Mucsi and Pragai, 1985). Although a variety of pharmacological activities associated with chemicals in H. cordata has been demonstrated, antiviral activities against PEDV have not been reported.",

The MeOH extract (247 g; IC50, 82.2 \u03bcg/mL; CC50, 1036.0 \u03bcg/mL) was separated into two fractions using EtOAc as the non-aqueous phase. The concentrated EtOAc fraction (16.0 g; IC50, 4.8 \u03bcg/mL; CC50, 62.1 \u03bcg/mL) was loaded on a silica gel (Merck, 230\u2013400 mesh, 300 g) column, and eluted with a step-gradient of CHCl3:MeOH (100:0, 98.5:1.5, 97:3, 93.75:6.25, 87.5:12.5, 25:75, 50:50 and 0:100; each 1 L) to afford eight fractions. The active fraction (CHCl3:MeOH, 50:50 fraction; 7.97 g; IC50, <1 \u03bcg/mL; CC50, >100 \u03bcg/mL) was separated using Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham pharmacia biotech AB, Sweden, 18\u2013111 mesh, 200 g), eluting successively with 80% methanol/water (v/v = 80/20; each 0.02 L), and 70 fractions were obtained. For further purification, the active fraction (combination of fractions from 41 to 43, 1.22 g; IC50, <1 \u03bcg/mL; CC50, >100 \u03bcg/mL) was subjected to analytical HPLC (YMC-Pack ODS-MA; i.d. 250 mm \u00d7 10 mm; eluent, 25% aq.

Next day, medium was removed and then washed with 1 \u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Infectivity of virus stock was determined by the SRB method using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction and was determined as infectivity of the virus by SRB ID50 (50% infective dose). Following this, 0.09 mL of diluted virus suspension of PEDV containing CCID50 (50% cell culture infective dose) of the virus stock to produce a appropriate cytopathic effects within 2 days after infection and 0.01 mL of medium supplemented with typsin-EDTA containing an appropriate concentration of the compounds were added. The antiviral activity of each test material was determined with a 10-fold diluted concentration ranging from 0.1 to 100 \u03bcg/mL. Three wells were used as virus controls (virus-infected non-drug-treated cells) while three wells were used as cell controls (non-infected non-drug-treated cells). The culture plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. After washing 1 times with 1 \u00d7 PBS, 100 \u03bcl of cold (\u221220 \u00b0C) 70% acetone were added to each well and left for 30 min at \u221220 \u00b0C. 70% acetone was removed and 96-well plates were left at dry oven for 30 min. 100 \u03bcl of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid solution were added to each well and left at room temperature for 30 min. Unbound SRB was removed and the plates were washed 5 times with 1% acetic acid before oven drying and were then left in a dry oven for 1 day. Bound SRB was solubilized with 100 \u03bcl of 10 mM unbuffered tris-base solution and plates were left on a table for 30 min. The absorbance was read at 540 nm by using a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a reference absorbance at 620 nm. To calculate the IC50 values, the results were transformed to percentage of controls and the IC50 values were graphically obtained from the dose-response curves. The percent protection achieved by the test compound in PEDV-infected cells was calculated by the following formula:(ODt)PEDV\u2212(ODc)PEDV(ODc)mock\u2212(ODc)PEDV\u00d7100 (expressed in %)where (ODt)PEDV is the optical density measured with a given concentration of the test compound in PEDV-infected cells; (ODc)PEDV is the optical density measured for the control untreated PEDV-infected cells; and (ODc)mock is the optical density measured for control untreated mock-infected cells. The concentration achieving 50% protection according to the formula above was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). The therapeutic index was defined as CC50/IC50.",

In this study, Q7R is an effective antiviral compound against PEDV. Q7R did not have a marked inhibitory effect on the growth of TGEV or PRCV-infected cells. The antiviral activity of this compound appeared to be strongly influenced by the strain of the coronaviruse tested.

This broad-spectrum antiviral drug was previously shown to be inhibitory to 16 DNA and RNA viruses in cell cultures (Sidwell et al., 1972). Trials of ribavirin in this study showed that the drug had favorable effects on antiviral activity in Vero cells infected with PEDV. In TGEV or PRCV, ribavirin had a weaker influence on survival of in Vero cells after infection with TGEV or PRCV.

Based on the results of the time-course study, pre-incubation of the Vero cells with Q7R did not protect the cells from PEDV infection (Fig. 2). Furthermore, Q7R can inhibit PEDV infection only when it was added on, during, and early stages after the virus inoculation (1, 2, 4 h), but not after 6 h or later (Fig. 2).
