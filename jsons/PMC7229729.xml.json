            "text": "Surveillance, described by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as \u2018\u2018the cornerstone of public health security\u2019\u2019 [1], is aimed at the detection of elevated disease and death rates, implementation of control measures and reporting to the WHO of any event that may constitute a public health emergency or international concern. Syndromic surveillance can be described as the real-time (or near real-time) collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health-related data, to enable the early identification of the impact (or absence of impact) of potential human or veterinary public health threats that require effective public health action [2]. The task of syndromic surveillance is an undertaking motivated by the notion of public health. Public health has been defined as the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals [3]. In this sense, the concept of health encompasses the physical, emotional and social well-being. Historically, public health practitioners have used data from multiple sources for measuring the burden of diseases and other health outcomes, preventing and controlling diseases and guiding healthcare activities. Emergency department attendances or general practitioner (GP, family doctor) consultations are some of the sources traditionally used to track specific syndromes such as influenza-like illnesses (ILI). With the proliferation of the internet and the advent of modern technology, potential new data sources present themselves. In recent years, researchers have recognized that social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, could also provide data about national-level health and behaviour [4].Among these social media platforms, Twitter offers a unique and potentially powerful data source due to its ease of access, real-time nature and richness in detail. In this paper, we look towards Twitter with the aim of investigating and assessing its utility as a public health tool by performing a scoping review on the subject. While we seek to review the literature of Public health research making use of Twitter, our interest in such literature is limited to research concerning the monitoring, detection and forecasting of public health conditions. We are not interested in social science research investigating the use of Twitter for recruitment or public awareness and dissemination of public health information. We are similarly not interested in research concerned with opinion mining to understand public opinion on public health issues.A scoping review such as ours is pertinent as there exist no broad and recent evidence-reviews on the use of Twitter data for health research purposes. Wargon et al. [5] performed a systematic review on syndromic surveillance models used in forecasting emergency department visits, however, only 9 studies were found and none of them made use of Twitter or any social media. Subsequently, Charles-Smithe et al. [6] carried out a systematic review of the use of social media (not limited to Twitter) specifically for disease surveillance and outbreak management. Sinnenberg et al. performed another systematic review looking at Twitter as a tool for health research [7]. Their systematic review encompassed research in both the sciences and social sciences. We seek to carry out a scoping review in order to map the broad area of Twitter for public health research as well as to produce an updated review containing more recent studies carried out since the above reviews were published. Hence, our research question is: \u2018\u2018What is known from the existing literature about the use of Twitter data in the context of monitoring, detection and forecasting of public health conditions?\u2019\u2018. We are particularly interested in the type of conditions/illnesses being studied; in the sources of data being used; in the data analysis techniques being applied; and in the geographical and time trends of such studies.

As our work is multidisciplinary in that it spans multiple fields, we conducted our search in both health and Information Technology (IT) databases. First, we performed a literature search in the health/medical database PubMed. Next, we searched the IT databases IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library. Finally, we searched a general database that indexed both fields, Scopus. Our searches were refined such that we only included research articles which were peer-reviewed and in English. We also limited our search to only return results within the date range of January 2009 and March 2019, which was when the search was carried out. We started our search from 2009 because of the highly influential Google Flu Trends paper published that year which inspired and kickstarted the use of social media as a data source for public health research [9].",

Articles were excluded if any of the following criteria were met: (i) the article did not report an original contribution (e.g. review papers or articles commenting or speculating on the state or future of such research); (ii) the article was focused on the use of Twitter for public health in the context of recruitment and outreach, public awareness and communication, information dissemination or opinion mining; (iii) the article did not make known the statistical or machine learning technique being used; (iv) the full text of the article was not available (e.g. conference abstracts).

We examined the subjects of the studies for trends in Twitter applications. We analysed and plotted the three most studied diseases for each year. Fig. 4\nshows the result of this analysis. Taking a closer look at the diseases, conditions and public health phenomena studied using Twitter data, we observed ILIs to be the most common. The next most common subject of public health research using Twitter were drug abuse and adverse drug events and/or reactions (ADE/R). Furthermore, we observed a general rise in the quantity of research into the use of Twitter for public health. Research activity appears to have peaked in 2016 but seems to be on the rise from 2018. As this scoping review looks at studies up until March 2019, the data for 2019 is incomplete.

Most studies implemented just one technique (n = 54) but some others made use of a mix of methods and techniques (n = 38). The articles made use of a range of statistical and machine learning techniques including supervised learning (n = 70) [e.g.Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive bayes, decision trees, logistic regression], unsupervised learning (n = 18) [e.g. clustering, association rule mining], semi-supervised learning (n = 4) [e.g. graph learning, transductive support vector machine (t-SVM)], text analysis and natural language processing (n = 23) [e.g. latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), biterm topic modelling, lexicon analysis], deep learning (n = 16) [e.g. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), word and document embeddings], statistical modelling and analysis (n = 12) [e.g. correclation analysis, partial differntial equation (PDE), TRAP] and time series analysis (n = 7) [e.g. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model]. The average number of Tweets used in the reviewed studies was roughly twenty thousand. A closer look at the research towards Twitter use for public health revealed that the SVM was a popular tool in this research field. We hypothesize that this is due to the SVM's popularity and strength in text classification problems [12]. We also analysed the surveyed studies to find out which statistical or machine learning algorithms were popular, as well as if and how this might have shifted over time. Fig. 5\nshows a plot of the most used algorithms for each year covered in this review. Lexicon-based analysis proved popular between 2012 until 2014. After this, Bayesian learning seemed to be the method of choice, followed by the SVM. From 2018, the widespread popularity of deep learning appears to have made its way into public health research with Twitter data, as it is becoming the dominant method used since then.",

Naturally, the surveillance domain encompasses the field of syndromic surveillance [[13], [14], [15]]. However, it is broad and also includes additional applications such as the tracking of vaccination efforts [16] and monitoring of environmental conditions [17,18], as well as for natural disaster reporting and alarming [19]. That being said, the most common application was the syndromic surveillance of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). Besides ILIs, other diseases and conditions that were studied include dengue, HIV, gastroenteritis, ebola, diarrhoea and allergies. Due to the extensive research carried out in this area, a wide range of techniques were used. For example, supervised learning applied in the form of k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) was used to monitor allergy trends and occurences [20]. Unsupervised learning was used in the form of Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering in order to exploit the spatial and temporal properties of the Twitter stream for dengue surveillance [21]. Semi-supervised learning was used in the form of transductive SVMs for the surveillance of ILIs, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea and vomiting [22].",

Research in this domain sought to automatically detect events and describe the magnitude and trend of disease, as well as the impact of control measures. Examples of applications in this domain are automatically detecting drug abuse within the population [55], depression and suicide [26], ebola [56] and most common of all, ILI [57]. Such research tends to be fairly recent with the mode publication year being 2016. The statistical and machine learning techniques used were typically supervised, with most studies employing either classification or regression to make the predictions necessary for detection. For example, SVMs were used to detect mention of \u2018\u2018dabbing\u2019\u2018, a method of marijuana consumption that involves inhaling vapors from heating marijuana concentrates [58]. CNNs were used to detect harmful algal blooms from pictures posted on Twitter [59]. Additionally, stepwise regression was used to detect depression from Tweets in order to explore the effect of climate and seasonality on mood [60].",

Usually, when studying the use of Twitter to detect adverse drug reactions and events, articles searched for a range of names obtained from a thesaurus of drugs and events, such as the Medline Plus Drug Information [83]. However, other such studies focused on a drug for a particular disease such as HIV [63]. In addition, studies also investigated drug habits and their effects on the population. For example, one article studied the use of e-cigarettes and their utility for smoking cessation [62]. Another article studied the variability of alcoholism with time [84]. A number of the pharmacovigilance studies utilized sentiment analysis, usually a form of supervised text classification, to aid in their efforts [28,63,83]. In fact, most of the studies make use of supervised learning in the form of text classification using mostly SVMs and decision trees. Of the 19 articles in this domain, three made use of deep learning [28,85,86], one employed a semi-supervised multi-instance learning approach [86] and three used unsupervised natural language processing [28,66,87].",

It can be seen as a part of the syndromic surveillance effort, aimed at predicting epidemics in order to improve crisis response. Research in this domain is focused predominantly on ILIs. Around 67% of the reviewed literature studied ILI. However, other diseases such as dengue, gastroenteritis, cancer and asthma were also studied [22,23,53,95]. While a mix of statistics and machine learning is used in this domain, there is a heavier focus on statistics. In fact most studies made use of statistical techniques like regression and time series analysis. For example, dynamic regression was used to predict infuenza trends in Boston, USA [96]. AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used to forecast influenza cases on a city level in Chongqing, China, as well as for predicting gatroenteritis in the UK [22,97]. Partial differential equations were used to forecast influenza cases on a regional level across the USA [44]. Deep learning was also used to aid in the forecasting problem of predicting influenza cases [40] and in the creation of SENTINEL, a software system system capable of nowcasting diseases being monitored by the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) [98].

Research in this domain is primarily interested in understanding the way in which diseases spread through a population. It looks toward not only gaining a better understanding of the spread of diseases, but also to keep track of the public health state during recognized outbreaks and mass gatherings which could be a breeding ground for disease. For example, one study investigated and proposed a means of traking flu transmission in China using Twitter [39]. Another study retrospectively tracked the spread of measles during the 2015 outbreak [101]. Additionally, there was a study to detect the occurence and spread of disease symptoms which could signify a potential outbreak at a number of British music festivals and a religious event in Mecca, Saudi Arabia [50]. Most studies in this domain made use of machine learning methods, leaning towards supervised learning. In particular, regression learning proved popular, as two studies utilized dynamic regression and support vector regression to track the spread of influenza [96,100]. Another study proposed a gaussian mixture regression approach to estimating the geographic origin of a tweet for use during an outbreak [102]. There were also some studies which used statistical analysis to obtain impressive results. One of such studies made use of the TSIR (time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model to understand human mobility and the spread of the dengue virus in Lahore, Pakistan [103]. While it was rare, one study made use of semi-supervised learning and deep learning to simulate influenza epidemics.",

Rather, it is used in conjunction with other domains to improve the efficacy of solutions or provide added benefit. It is most often used with surveillance and disease tracking. Methods used in geograhic identification are typically based on unsupervised learning. For example, DBSCAN clustering was used to monitor and track obesity levels within the population [54], as well as track the spread of the dengue virus [21]. Another study utilized hot spot analysis to examine spatial patterns of depression on Twitter. Some supervised learning, typically in the form of classification is also used in geographic identification. Here, a classifier is used to predict the location of a tweet based on some features of the tweet, usually its word collocations. As an example, one study in the review made use of a random forest classifier to predict which city and province a tweet determined to be from Canada (according to the Twitter API), was from Ref. [105]. While geographic identification in itself is not of major use to the field of public health, when combined with other identified public health research domains, it offers improvements on the specificity and granularity of their results.",

First, we identified the key application domains being studied: (i) surveillance; (ii) event detection; (iii) pharmacovigilance; (iv) forecasting; (v) disease tracking and (vi) geographic identification. Studies were found to predominantly be concerned with surveillance, event detection and pharmacovigilance. Next, the conditions and diseases being tackled using Twitter data were identified. We discovered a wide range of illnesses to which Twitter data is being applied to including infectious diseases, mental health problems, environmental issues and social issues. Finally, we mapped out the statistical and machine learning algorithms and approaches being used to process and analyse Twitter data for public health purposes. In doing so, we observed trends in these approaches. Bayesian learning and SVMs appear to be popular algorithms of choice, however, in the past two years the focus seems to have shifted towards deep learning.",

In particular, the reviewed research focused heavily on the surveillance and detection of influenza. However, we have identified significant scope to explore the use of Twitter data in other infectious diseases. Some such studies are beginning to take place (e.g. dengue or ebola) but much more work is expected in the light of recent outbreaks. Often outbreaks are fast moving situations and research needs to progress very quickly so our findings will facilitate such endevours. Whereas we may not expect Twitter data to be of use for the study of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as such a study would rely on Twitter user-reporting what may be quite sensitive information, other infectious diseases such as cholera could be studied. Furthermore, we have also identified the potential utility of Twitter and social media for public health in the context of non-infectious diseases, such as asthma or celiac disease as little work has so far been reported in the literature, yet those diseases can represent a large health burden. An additional area of application may be the occurrence of positive health states/outcomes. Our review did not identify any articles that used Twitter for this, although it might be a result of the limitations of our scoping methodology.",

This is somewhat understandable as the most popular application domains were surveillance and detection, which are related to the supervised learning tasks of classification and prediction. The average number of Tweets used in the reviewed studies was roughly twenty thousand. This suggests that most of the reviewed articles had large amounts of labelled Twitter data available to them which leads to supervised learning tasks. Unfortunately, such labeling could constitute a sizeable effort so we have identified the use of unsupervised learning, and particularly semi-supervised learning, as another potential area for new exploration. Such approaches would reduce the amount of labelled Twitter data required by also taking advantage of the unlabeled data. Some articles are already starting to emerge [91,104] but mostly only focused on ILI so far.",

This may suggest that it is somewhat difficult to translate research using Twitter for public health into practice. We believe the bulk of this challenge might come from the ethical issues involved and the lack of an ethical framework for the integration of social media into surveillance systems. Hence the development of robust ethical frameworks could be an important area for future work. That being said, public health institutions around the world may already be using Twitter as such a tool, and just not reporting their efforts.",
