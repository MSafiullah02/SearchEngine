However, only in some groups, hospital COVID-19 cases have an older age than the reference population. Therefore, although older age is a clear risk factor, disease or therapy related factors also seem to modify the risk for hospital COVID-19 cases in the different rheumatic patients\u00b4 groups. We are aware of a still unknown but important number of rheumatic patients with milder SARS-CoV-2 disease whose detection was based on self-reporting and phone consultations, but not confirmed by PCR testing.
