From January 23, 2020 (the date of Wuhan lockdown) to March 23, 2020, 4 acute abdomen patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were admitted to our hospital: cases 1 and 2 showed signs of acute peritonitis, whereas chest CT and radiographic examinations in cases 3 and 4 indicated gastrointestinal perforation and acute peritonitis as well. Moreover, all 4 patients presented pulmonary opacifications or infiltrations in the lung lobes on chest CT, whereas 3three of them showed symptoms/signs of pneumonia. Given the epidemiological history was unclear and the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide,3\u20135 the risk of COVID-19 could not be totally ruled out in these patients. Oropharyngeal swab samples were immediately collected and sent for SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

For example, case 1 patient displayed signs of septic shock after admission, indicating an urgent need for surgical intervention. Therefore, emergency laparotomy was scheduled for these patients in compliance with tertiary protection regulations,7 which means that all involved medical staff had to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE), including disposable N95/FFP2 respirators, double gloves, goggles, visors, caps, shoes, and body protection coveralls/gowns.",

Postoperatively, all patients with suspected COVID-19 were transferred to isolated recovery rooms or ICUs to await final RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Although all 4 patients obtained negative results afterwards, the medical staff involved in the treatment of these patients complied with the tertiary protection regulations and wore full PPE throughout their treatment.
