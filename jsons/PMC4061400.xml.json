This unfavorable event typically advances at the expense of protein refolding energy, and under the control of mechanisms that ensure its evolvement at defined cell locations and physiological stages. Despite the variety of physiological conditions involving membrane fusion events, the same basic principles underlying lipid bilayer remodeling seem to apply to all the expressions of this phenomenon (see Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003, Cohen and Melikyan, 2004, Frolov and Zimmerberg, 2010, Kozlov et al., 2010, Zimmerberg et al., 1993) and references therein for comprehensive reviews on this issue).",

            "text": "The protein-assisted membrane fusion reaction has been co-opted by lipid-enveloped pathogens, including enveloped viruses (White, 1992, White et al., 2008). Thus, enveloped viruses comprising highly relevant human pathogens such as Influenza virus (IFV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Ebola virus (EBOV), make use of membrane glycoproteins for selecting host cells, induce membrane fusion and gain access to internal compartments, a sequence of processes collectively known as \u201cviral entry\u201d(White et al., 2008). Given the dynamic nature of viral genomes and the vast number of replication cycles taking place during infection of a single host, viral entry machineries are subject to intense molecular evolution. Thus, the themes of glycoprotein structure\u2013function common to all enveloped viruses are highly significant for the understanding of the general mechanism of protein-mediated fusion (Blumenthal et al., 2012, Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003, Cohen and Melikyan, 2004, Harrison, 2008, Hernandez et al., 1996, Kozlov et al., 2010, Lentz et al., 2000, Melikyan, 2008). In addition, the conserved elements of these machineries, transiently or permanently exposed on the virion surface, provide clinical targets for development of inhibitors (antivirals) and immunogens (vaccines) (Blumenthal and Dimitrov, 2007, Doms and Moore, 2000, Eckert and Kim, 2001, Forssmann et al., 2010, Huarte et al., 2011, Munch et al., 2007).",

            "text": "\nFig. 1A displays a generally accepted mechanism of membrane fusion induced by prototypical Class I viral glycoproteins, such as those of IFV, HIV or EBOV. The model is supported by the available structural and functional evidence (reviewed in references Blumenthal et al., 2012, Eckert and Kim, 2001, Harrison, 2008, Melikyan, 2008, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Wiley and Skehel, 1987). The mature envelope glycoproteins in those viruses are organized as trimers of non-covalently associated heterodimers. Each heterodimer is composed of a surface and a trans-membrane subunit, which mediate receptor binding and virus-cell fusion, respectively (Karlsson Hedestam et al., 2008, Roux and Taylor, 2007, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Wiley and Skehel, 1987). Upon fusion activation, the ectodomain of the membrane-anchored subunit undergoes a series of conformational changes conducive to membrane merger. First a \u201cpre-hairpin\u201d intermediate forms to anchor viral and cell membranes through the transmembrane (TMD) and fusion peptide (FP) domains, respectively. The presence of the FP within the ectodomain exposed to the aqueous phase constitutes a feature shared by all viral fusion proteins, and represents an absolute requirement for their fusogenic function (previously reviewed in: Durell et al., 1997, Epand, 2003, Nieva and Agirre, 2003, Tamm et al., 2002). These hydrophobic and conserved sequences usually located at the N-terminal end of the fusogenic subunit, or close to it (Table 1\n), are thought to be involved in driving the initial partitioning of the fusion protein into the target membrane (Nieva and Suarez, 2000). In this first stage, formation (IFV hemagglutinin (HA)) or completion (HIV-Envelope protein (Env)) of an extended coiled coil (red rods in Fig. 1A) by N-terminal helices (or N-terminal heptad repeats, NHRs) would be the propelling force that brings about exposition and translocation of the initially cryptic FP into close vicinity of the target membrane.",

In the trimeric hairpin structure, the ectodomain amino- and carboxy-termini are placed at the same end of the molecule (Eckert and Kim, 2001, Weissenhorn et al., 1997). In several instances, this second step might ensue due to the fact that the extended N-terminal coiled coil creates highly conserved grooves into which C-terminal helices (or C-terminal heptad repeats, CHRs) may hydrophobically pack in an antiparallel orientation (yellow rods in Fig. 1A). It is assumed that the conformational energy released during the trimeric hairpin formation can be used to pull membranes together and induce their merger, while its completion upon full zippering of the CHR would stabilize an open state of the fusion pore and likely contribute to its expansion (Melikyan, 2008).",

A great deal of experimental work produced in the course of the last 25 years supports this view. In one hand, convincing evidence for the insertion of the VFPs into target membranes was early provided by Brunner's group using hydrophobic photolabeling approaches (Durrer et al., 1996, Harter et al., 1989, Tsurudome et al., 1992, Weber et al., 1994). The IFV glycoprotein HA is synthesized as a single polypeptide, which is posttranslationally cleaved into two disulfide-linked chains, HA1 and HA2. The hydrophobic N terminus of HA2 generated after cleavage embodies the IFV-FP. Brunner and co-workers demonstrated that, upon incubation at conditions that activate IFV fusion (i.e., pH 5.0 and 37 \u00b0C), the hydrophobic interactions of isolated BHA2 (the bromelain-solubilized form of hemagglutinin) or IFV virions were mediated solely by the N-terminal segment of the HA2 subunit, which corresponds to the FP (Harter et al., 1989, Tsurudome et al., 1992). They found that the predominant sites of labeling within this segment were spaced in average 3\u20134-residues, thereby suggesting that the FP inserted into the target membrane adopting a helical structure with an amphiphilic character (see also Fig. 3B below). From asymmetric hydrophobic photolabeling of membranes, evidence was obtained indicating that HA2-FP penetrates only the external leaflet of the bilayer in the fusion pH conformation (Brunner, 1989). In addition these authors provided evidence to sustain a mechanism of IFV inactivation at acidic pH, according to which the HA2 FP irreversibly inserted into the viral membrane (Weber et al., 1994).",

The fact that Class II glycoproteins make use of trimeric hairpins to induce fusion underpins the functional relevance of these structures (Harrison, 2008, Vaney and Rey, 2011). However, in contrast to the helical domains implied in Class I fusion, the Class II glycoprotein subunits employ articulated \u03b2-barrel domains to assemble membrane-pulling trimeric hairpins (Harrison, 2008, Vaney and Rey, 2011, White et al., 2008). Yet another class of fusion glycoproteins combine structural features of Class I and Class II fusion proteins, and have been designated as Class III (Backovic and Jardetzky, 2009, Baquero et al., 2013, Weissenhorn et al., 2007, White et al., 2008). Fusogenic subunits of Class II and Class III proteins possess conserved hydrophobic loops that connect extended strands at the tip of elongated \u03b2-barrel domains. These \u201cfusion loops\u201d (FLs) are thought to insert into the target membrane and function during fusion in a way reminiscent of Class I FPs. Thus, the fact that Class I/II/III glycoproteins make use of similar elements, but different structural scaffolds, highlights the functional convergence underlying cell-virus membrane fusion.",

We previously reviewed many aspects of VFP-membrane interactions, paying particular attention to the physiological relevance of studies based on synthetic peptides and membrane models (Nieva and Agirre, 2003). For excellent, contemporary reviews on VFP-related issues the reader is referred to: (Durell et al., 1997, Epand, 2003, Epand et al., 1992, Peisajovich and Shai, 2003, Tamm and Han, 2000). Here, we first give a brief overview on our current understanding of the structure and function of the VFPs, and then update some case studies (Sections 2, 3, respectively). This review primarily focuses on Class I VFPs, as they conform more closely to the notion of FP domain (Epand et al., 1992, Gallaher, 1987). Nonetheless, Section 4 will be devoted to the description of Class II/III FLs. Section 5 will deal with the possible assistance by other hydrophobic-conserved regions present in glycoprotein sequences, particularly the \u201cmembrane-proximal external regions\u201d known as MPER domains. Finally in Section 6, based on the HIV-1 case, we will succinctly discuss the potential implications of this knowledge for the development of unprecedented anti-viral compounds.",

One feature shared by these sequences is that, despite the phylogenetic divergence, amino acid homology between FPs from Class I viral families can be as high as 90% (Gallaher, 1987). VFPs also gather unusual amounts of Ala and Gly residues, and, in particular when located internally, they contain invariable Pro residues (Gomara et al., 2004). Such a degree of residue conservation and Ala/Gly content are uncommon for hydrophobic protein domains as signal sequences or transmembrane anchors. The occurrence of these residues further suggests an intrinsic conformational flexibility that cannot be explained by the simple requirement of membrane insertion. Thus, FP sequences have evolved constrained by selective pressures beyond the thresholds imposed by mere hydrophobicity or amphipathicity.",

In this regard, aromatics\u2019 contribution maybe relevant for enabling membrane insertion of internal FPs (Table 1). In these instances, the absence of a free N-terminus constraints conformational transitions in contact with the membrane surface (Gomara et al., 2004, Suarez et al., 2003). The favorable interactions of aromatic side chains with phospholipid moieties located at the membrane interface region may in addition contribute to stabilize the insertion of the FP sequence into just one bilayer leaflet (White and Wimley, 1999). An initial interaction restricted to one monolayer has been proposed to generate elastic stresses conducive to bilayer fusion (see below).",

This would represent the first stage in the life of VFPs (Fig. 1A-(1)). The IFV-FP solved within the trimeric HA complex was for many years the only available VFP atomic structure in a native, pre-fusion state (Wiley and Skehel, 1987). The native IFV-FP folds as a loop partly buried into a pocket of ionizable residues, and with the hydrophobic N-terminus occluded at interfaces between HA2 transmembrane subunits. However, the IFV-FP model is not generalizable to all Class I viral fusion glycoproteins, as evidenced by the native structures available later on (Lee et al., 2008, Lyumkis et al., 2013, Yin et al., 2006). Thus, EBOV-FP and Parainfluenza virus-5 (PIV5)-FP locate in the periphery of the pre-fusion glycoprotein complex, partially accessible from solution, and interacting extensively with the surface subunits (Lee et al., 2008, Yin et al., 2006). A similar pattern has been recently suggested for the HIV-FP (Julien et al., 2013, Lyumkis et al., 2013). Thus, the occurrence of distinct native structures suggest that the VFP sequence homology between divergent virus families probably sustains common functional roles beyond folding after synthesis.",

Especially in the case of N-terminal sequences, it is assumed that membrane partitioning, initially driven by favorable hydrophobic interactions between FP monomers and the membrane interface (Table 1), will result in the partitioning-coupled structuring of the FP sequence as an autonomous domain. Thus, structures adopted within the target membrane milieu might represent a second functional state common to all VFPs (Fig. 1A-(2)). From that perspective, experimental approaches based on synthetic surrogates and model membranes have been applied to establish physiologically relevant, functional VFP states (see for earlier discussions on this issue Durell et al., 1997, Epand et al., 1992, Nieva and Agirre, 2003). Insertion patterns and conformations adopted by synthetic versions of the VFPs in model membranes and mimics have been characterized by a plethora of biophysical and structural techniques including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (Chang et al., 1997, Han et al., 2001, Qiang et al., 2008), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) (Macosko et al., 1997, Tamm et al., 2007), and Infrared spectroscopy (IR) (Buzon et al., 2005, Castano and Desbat, 2005, Epand et al., 2001, Gray et al., 1996, Haque et al., 2005, Li and Tamm, 2007, Luneberg et al., 1995, Martin et al., 1993, Mobley et al., 1999, Pereira et al., 1995, Pereira et al., 1997). These studies reveal that the main conformation adopted by VFPs in membranes, insertion depth and insertion angle may vary depending on factors like the membrane lipid composition (particularly the presence of cholesterol or anionic phospholipids) or peptide length (Kliger et al., 1997, Lai et al., 2012, Wexler-Cohen et al., 2006). When physiologically relevant, as it is the case of single sequence substitutions that recreate mutations interfering with the fusogenic activity of the full glycoprotein, these factors allow delineating structure\u2013function relationships shared by VFPs from distinct origin (Nieva and Agirre, 2003).",

            "text": "The IFV-FP sequence is probably the most widely studied VFP following this approach. The HA2 post-fusion structure reveals N- and C-terminal residues that form an N cap terminating both the N-terminal \u03b1-helix and the central coiled coil (Chen et al., 1999). This structure implies that continuous \u03b1 helices are not required for membrane fusion at either the N or C termini of the trimeric hairpin. In addition, residue 34 marks the end of the capping structure at the N-terminus, thereby suggesting that the functional structures and dynamics in membranes of the upstream IFV-FP (residues 1\u201323) are likely to be barely affected by the rest of the HA2 sequence. A main helical structure adopted by a synthetic IFV-FP in contact with membranes and its mimics was put forward by early studies (Chang et al., 2000, Dubovskii et al., 2000, Gray et al., 1996, Lear and DeGrado, 1987, Luneberg et al., 1995). Additional studies revealed that insertion of this element could lead to lipid bilayer destabilization as evidenced by the induction of leakage of aqueous contents and lipid-mixing when added to liposomes (Colotto and Epand, 1997, Epand et al., 2001, Lear and DeGrado, 1987, Rafalski et al., 1991). A further line of evidence suggested that an oblique angle of insertion into the lipid bilayer might be required to sustain those membrane destabilization phenomena (Epand et al., 2001, Gray et al., 1996, Luneberg et al., 1995).",

In one study, the main \u03b1-helical conformation was observed in all the analyzed variants (Gray et al., 1996). However, the nonfusogenic peptides exhibited larger amounts of \u03b2-like conformers.

The V2E change impaired insertion of synthetic HIV-1-FP into membrane monolayers and caused a reduction of membrane activity measured in liposomes. However, in contrast to what is observed for IFV-FP, the HIV-FP may adopt a functional \u03b2-strand structure in contact with membranes (Buzon et al., 2005, Castano and Desbat, 2005, Lai et al., 2012, Mobley et al., 1999, Sackett and Shai, 2005, Yang et al., 2001), and the V2E substitution was shown to interfere with the adoption of that conformation (Gabrys et al., 2013, Pereira et al., 1995). A series of Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR)-IR studies also suggested an oblique angle of insertion for the membrane-bound functional HIV-FP (Martin et al., 1993, Martin et al., 1996), which was confirmed by later structural determinations (Castano and Desbat, 2005, Morris et al., 2004). Thus, insertion in an oblique angle and the capability of alternating \u03b1/\u03b2 conformations depending on membrane dose and lipid composition emerged as common structural patterns from those analyses. However, the membrane-bound conformation most active at generating membrane destabilization differed in the IFV-FP or HIV-FP.",

Some authors argue that VFPs function as inert anchors, i.e., \u201csecondary\u201d transmembrane domains (TMDs) inserted into the target membrane (Donald et al., 2011, Skehel and Wiley, 2000). According to this view, conformational polymorphism of the membrane-inserted FP might contribute to the flexibility of the fusogenic complex during the fusion reaction cycle (Saez-Cirion and Nieva, 2002, Suarez et al., 2003). Following the \u201chairpin\u201d model (Fig. 1A), the rod-shaped glycoprotein ectodomain must alternate a configuration with its axis perpendicular to the target bilayer normal (inserted prefusion state) with a configuration mainly parallel to the membrane interface supposedly adopted within the trimeric hairpin structure. Thus, the presence of jointed kinks to enable backbone reorientation and the capacity for alternating FP insertion levels might be required for the final stages of the fusion cascade to evolve.",

Bilayers must be first brought into close apposition, a process that requires overcoming the highly repulsive hydration and electrostatic forces operating at the membrane surface (Fig. 1B-1). Repulsion can be minimized within pointlike membrane protrusions created by focal application of curvature/tension stress (Fig. 1B-2-top). Formation of these structures might lead to closer apposition of the contacting monolayers and generation of small hydrophobic patches. The most widely accepted model, based on a continuous approach of membranes in terms of their elastic properties, posits that an hourglass-shaped lipid structure termed \u201cstalk\u201d, with mean negative curvature, subsequently emerges at the point where interbilayer contact has been established (Fig. 1B-2-bottom). The stalk allows mixing of the lipids from the contacting monolayers (cis-monolayers), but not of those from the distal ones (trans-monolayers). According to the original proposal of the stalk theory, distal monolayers collapse into a single bilayer referred to as a \u201chemifusion diaphragm\u201d (HD) (Fig. 1B-3-top). Increasing tension at the HD leads to the formation of a small hydrophilic pore, a process facilitated by positive curvature of the HD monolayers (Fig. 1B-3-bottom). A \u201cfusion pore\u201d is eventually formed, which connects the internal aqueous volumes enclosed by the originally separated membranes (Fig. 1B-4).",

In a first instance insertion into one monolayer of an amphipatic VFP structure might help overcoming the hydration repulsion force between approaching bilayers by orienting a poorly solvated face toward the external medium (Fig. 1C (1)). Pre-stalk fusion intermediates maybe subsequently elicited by breaching lipid continuity and generating focal hydrophobic patches (Fig. 1C (2)). Recent molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) suggest that hydrophobic defects generated by IFV-FP in the \u201cboomerang\u201d conformation (see below) might cause lipid tail protrusions (Larsson and Kasson, 2013). It has been argued that a lipid molecule splaying its two acyl chains may suffice to build an initial lipid bridge between contacting bilayers (Frolov and Zimmerberg, 2010, Kinnunen and Holopainen, 2000, Kozlov et al., 2010).",

Indirect proof consistent with this effect comes from the capacity of VFPs for lowering the temperatures of lamellar-to-non-lamellar (HII) phase transitions. Accordingly, the ability of HIV-1-FP to induce lipid mixing in large unilamellar liposomes was correlated with its ability for modulating the lipid polymorphism in bulk systems (Pereira et al., 1999). This concept was also supported by studies addressing the effects of point mutations at the N-terminal amino acid, Gly, of IFV-FP (Epand and Epand, 1994, Epand et al., 2001). Only the wild-type peptide could substantially decrease the temperature of the lamellar-to-non-lamellar (HII) phase transition at pH 5. In addition a correlation existed between the fusogenic activities of the full protein and the effect of the FPs on monolayer curvature, as monitored by a shift in the temperature of the polymorphic phase transition.",

In the case of the HIV-FP, it was hypothesized that insertion into the external membrane monolayer may induce lateral stress in the hydrocarbon region and/or selectively induce an increment of its surface (Agirre et al., 2000). As a consequence bulges (or dimples) that protrude from the membrane plane would be created (Fig. 1C (4) right panel). The tops of these structures are highly curved, an arrangement that can facilitate the formation of lipid contacts between fusing bilayers (Kozlov et al., 2010). This mode of VFP action would be also consistent with an alternative mechanism of fusion, which posits that the process can be mediated by activated glycoproteins with their FPs inserted into the viral membrane (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003). Bilayer deformation can be additionally facilitated by compounds that lower the bending rigidity of the bilayer. Thus membrane-embedded VFPs may behave as additives that disorder and soften the lipid bilayer matrix making it more prone for bending or expansion (Fig. 1C (4) left panel). Recent low-angle x-ray scattering studies reveal that the inserted HIV-FP indeed reduces the bending modulus (K\nC) of the lipid bilayer (Tristram-Nagle et al., 2010, Tristram-Nagle and Nagle, 2007).",

Thus, VFPs might contribute to lower the energy of those voids, thereby facilitating lipid mixing of cis-monolayers and/or establishment of trans-monolayer contacts (TMCs) (Fig. 1C (6)). Evidence supporting this VFP role mainly derives from experiments of PEG-mediated fusion (Chakraborty et al., 2013, Haque et al., 2011). The physiological relevance of those studies has been put forward by the comparison of wild-type IFV-FP and two derived mutants, G1E and G13L. The wild-type peptide enhanced PEG-induced fusion, increased the bilayer interior packing and filled the membrane free volume, while the mutants caused no change in PEG-induced fusion or interior packing. It was inferred that the functional IFV-FP promotes conversion of the stalk to an expanded TMC intermediate through its ability to fill the voids within this latter structure (Fig. 1C (6)).",

Small-angle X-ray diffraction results showed that the action of the IFV-FP on lipid polymorphism was strongly pH-dependent (Colotto and Epand, 1997). In particular, the ability of peptide to promote cubic phases exhibited the same dependence on the pH as viral fusion. Since bilayers arranged into bicontinuous QII phases bear curvatures reminiscent of those purportedly existing within unexpanded fusion pores, it has been proposed that a plausible mechanism of fusion-promotion by the IFV-FP could be that this element may help destabilizing bilayer diaphragms at TMCs, or favor bilayer states of negative Gaussian curvature (Siegel and Epand, 2000, Tenchov et al., 2013).",

Formation of the fully zipped trimer-of-hairpins ectodomain has been shown to be required for this step (Blumenthal et al., 2012, Melikyan, 2008). In turn, 6-HB completion may lead to the formation of complexes between the membrane-embedded N-terminal FP and the C-terminal TMD (Armstrong et al., 2000, Tamm, 2003). These integral membrane oligomers might represent the third and last stage in the life of the VFPs (Fig. 1A-(3)).

The assembly occurred in an antiparallel manner, the TMD being at the core of the structure. In addition, as compared to homo-oligomers, the hetero-oligomers showed an enhanced membrane disrupting ability, likely due to a deeper membrane penetration of the FPs. These authors concluded that the assembly of the FP-TMD structure and its recruitment to the fusion site could cause the rupture of the membrane inner leaflets in a post-stalk state, resulting in initiation and enlargement of the fusion pore.",

These authors observed that homo-oligomerization of isolated PIV5 FPs into hexameric bundles occurred in DPC micelles. According to ATR-IR results, FPs would adopt a transmembrane orientation in lipid bilayers. Supporting this idea, MDS of the FP six-helix bundle in lipid bilayers predicted a parallel orientation of the constituent monomers, with its periodically conserved small residues localized at the helix-helix interfaces, and allowing permeation of water into the hexamer core. Tight hetero-association of FP with TMD peptides also occurred in the membrane mimetic DPC. Based on their experimental data and the outcome of the simulations, the authors proposed that FP hexamers may create holes (\u201cpinpricks\u201d) within the target membrane. Further tilting of the helices within approaching bilayers enable the formation of FP-TMD bundles, which eventually provides a low-energy pathway to direct fusion.",

These authors made use of an in vivo fluorescence assay to determine FP hetero-assembly with the TMD (probably via its GLRI motif) within the membrane milieu, and the ability of the latter to self-assemble via its GxxxG motif. Besides, heteroassociation between FP and TMD peptides led to enhanced lipid mixing of model membranes. Furthermore, peptides derived from the TMD and FP could inhibit virus-cell fusion probably by interfering with the functional association of the parental endogenous regions.

As compared to the neutral pH structure, the low pH structure of a 20-mer synthetic peptide inserts deeper while the C-terminal arm transitions from an extended structure to a shorter 310-helix (Fig. 2\nB-left). This low-pH-induced structural change was proposed to intensify the FP capacity to distort bilayer architecture (see also (Larsson and Kasson, 2013)). The \u201cinverted V\u201d model was subsequently tested by assessing the effects of IFV-FP mutations that interfere with fusion activity of the full HA protein. In particular, the effects of G1S and G1V mutations, which respectively cause hemifusion and abolish fusion, were first examined (Li et al., 2005). The NMR structures disclosed a V with a disrupted \u201cglycine edge\u201d on its N-terminal arm and a slightly tilted linear helical structure, for the G1S and G1V mutants, repectively. Abolishment of the kink in G1V resulted in reduced hydrophobic penetration of the lipid bilayer and an increased propensity to form \u03b2-structures at the membrane surface (Fig. 2B-left).",

The role of a specific fixed angle \u201cboomerang\u201d structure in fusion was underpinned by the effect of changing W14, a residue involved in kink stabilization (Lai et al., 2006). The W14A substitution was shown to cause inactivation of HA, while the structure of a synthetic IFV-FP bearing the mutation disclosed a flexible kink with an inverted orientation. Thus, the mutant pointed out of the membrane, in contrast to the ordered boomerang of the wild-type, which pointed into the membrane. The W14A fusion phenotype and FP structures were later reproduced by a double substitution F9A/I10A, an observation that underscores the functional importance of membrane-oriented large hydrophobic residues on both sides of the kink region of IFV-FP to fix the angle of the boomerang structure (Lai and Tamm, 2007). Recently published MDS analyses give further support to this idea (Legare and Lague, 2012).",

Interestingly, early assays performed by Brunner and coworkers (Harter et al., 1989) had identified in the radioactivity profiles these same residues (i.e., including Trp-21 and, to a lower extent, Tyr-22) as the main sites of labeling by membrane-residing photoactivable probes after low pH-induced interaction of BHA with liposomes (Fig. 3B). This arrangement of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues relative to the hairpin surface generates an amphipatic structure predicted to stably associate with the water-lipid interface of a membrane leaflet.

            "text": "However, these studies also confirm early observations indicating that membrane-active structures of IFV-FP and HIV-FP are different. After some debate at the time the proposal was first formulated (Mobley et al., 1999, Nieva et al., 1994, Pereira et al., 1995, Pereira et al., 1997), considerable experimental evidence has been accumulated, which ascribes a fusogenic role to \u03b2-like extended HIV-FP structures (Buzon et al., 2005, Castano and Desbat, 2005, Haque et al., 2005, Lai et al., 2012, Sackett et al., 2010, Sackett and Shai, 2005, Saez-Cirion and Nieva, 2002). Most prominently, SS-NMR data reported by Weliky's group has provided in conjunction unambiguous evidence for the adoption of oligomeric \u03b2 strand structure by the HIV-FP inserted into lipid bilayers (Qiang et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2004a). In particular, the work by Qiang et al. was key to determine the relevance of this structure under fusion-promoting conditions (Qiang et al., 2009) (see also Fig. 4B). In that work the authors compared structure, fusogenicity and insertion depth of wild-type HIV-FP, a V2E mutant and a cross-linked trimeric HIV-FP that emulates the putative oligomerization state of HIV gp41. All peptides adopted a \u03b2-sheet structure in membranes with physiologically relevant cholesterol content. However, in liposome fusion assays the V2E peptide was not active, while trimeric HIV-FP displayed higher potency than the monomeric peptide. The membrane locations as inferred from SS-NMR measurements indicated subtle insertion of the V2E mutant at the membrane surface, deeper insertion into a single membrane leaflet for the monomeric wt, and the deepest level of insertion for the trimeric HIV-FP, which contacted with the center of the membrane. Thus, for a fixed \u03b2-sheet secondary structure, a deeper level of insertion correlated with higher fusogenicity. As depicted in the model of Fig. 4B, an intriguing possibility is that the deeply inserted, distorted \u03b2-sheets might induce both local dehydration and hydrophobic defects in the monolayer (shadowed areas), thereby increasing the probability of hydrophobic tail flipping upon membrane adhesion (Fig. 1B-(2)).",

These authors report structure\u2013function experiments consistent with the fusogenicity of \u03b1- and \u03b2-structures adopted by the HIV-FP in Chol-depleted or Chol-containing membranes, respectively (see also the discussion by Epand, 2012).

In a series of works initiated by Sackett and Shai (Sackett and Shai, 2003), the structure\u2013function of the FP within constructs encompassing this region plus downstream gp41 helical domains has been investigated (Sackett et al., 2009, Sackett et al., 2010, Sackett and Shai, 2005, Sackett et al., 2011). The early studies in this series demonstrated that in trimeric constructs containing the NHR oligomerization domain to model the pre-hairpin intermediate, the FP sequence remained active while retaining its tendency to assemble into \u03b2-sheet structures in the membrane (Sackett and Shai, 2003, Sackett and Shai, 2005). Later analyses have revealed that fusogenicity of the FP is hampered within a construct representing post-fusion 6-HB structures, even though the membrane-associated extended structure still existed within these constructs (Sackett et al., 2010, Sackett et al., 2009). In conjunction, these data underscore the fusogenic function of the FP sequence during the fusion stages that precede trimeric hairpin formation, and support the hypothesis that the FP of HIV constitutes an autonomous folding domain.",

These authors subsequently examined changes in membrane interactions, using synthetic peptides representative of both wild-type and VM114/115AA mutant F proteins. Consistent with an alteration of the membrane interaction pattern, incubation with the VM114/115AA peptide resulted in a 75% reduction of hemolysis.

Thus, PIV5-FP was found to adopt \u03b1-helical structure in anionic membranes, but it was mostly \u03b2-sheet in neutral ones. The latter structure caused membrane surface dehydration and curvature. Accordingly the authors ascribe a role for the PIV5-FP \u03b2-sheet structure in promoting/stabilizing the hemifusion intermediate.

These initial reports suggested that anionic phospholipids might be required for the efficient insertion of EBOV-FP into membranes (Ruiz-Arguello et al., 1998, Suarez et al., 2003). This requirement was not based on the establishment of strong peptide-lipid electrostatic interactions, but rather on the easier access of the FP sequence to the hydrophobic region in the anionic bilayers, and the favorable contribution of its partial structuring therein to the overall energy of partitioning. A helix inserted in a tilted orientation was subsequently posited as the effective fusogenic structure of the sequence (Adam et al., 2004). Somehow contrasting this proposal, it was further suggested that stabilization of a loop structure within membranes by a Pro residue was required for the EBOV-FP membrane activity (Gomara et al., 2004).",

In accordance with previous low-resolution studies, the EBOV-FP sequence was shown to get partially structured in contact with SDS micelles at pH 7.0 by adopting a 310-helix in the central part (Freitas et al., 2007). Furthermore, spectroscopic measurements and MDS suggested the participation of the central aromatic residues in interactions with rigid membranes (see also (Freitas et al., 2011)). Gregory and co-workers further analyzed the effect of the \u03b2-sheet scaffold and pH on the structure adopted by EBOV-FP in membrane mimics (Gregory et al., 2011). Their analysis yielded a model for the structure\u2013function of this domain (Fig. 2B-right). According to these authors, a conformational change from a relatively flat extended loop structure at pH 7.0 to a bent structure at pH 5.5 would reorient the hydrophobic patch at the tip of the FP. The latter structure display helical features within a reversing turn inserting into the membrane. It is tempting to speculate that the energy contribution from structuring one portion of the C\u03b1 chain is required for the favorable insertion of the full loop. This mode of interaction would facilitate disruption of lipids in a way reminiscent to that of N-terminal VFPs.",

This notion is further substantiated by the findings reported in the case of the Class III VSV-G protein (Roche et al., 2006). VSV-G contains at the tip of domain IV a bipartite FL composed of 2 short loops, which together contribute just three aromatic residues to the interaction with the target membrane (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The fact that they may remain inserted into the viral membrane in the pre-fusion state further emphasizes that insertion of those residues does not by itself destabilize membranes (Roche et al., 2007). This is in contrast to Class I IFV, which shows dramatic changes in envelope morphology, fused virions and disorganized HA spikes upon low-pH-induced FP insertion into the envelope (Fontana et al., 2012).",

Confirming this prediction, a synthetic peptide representing this region bound, permeabilized and fused model membranes made of neutral phospholipids and cholesterol, even more potently than a peptide representing the FP. Moreover, replacement in this peptide of the first three Trp residues by Ala, reported by Salzwedel et al. to render a fusion defective gp41 phenotype, abrogated its ability to induce membrane fusion, supporting the physiological relevance of the in vitro approach (Suarez et al., 2000a, Suarez et al., 2000b). Further development of the WW analysis suggested that MPER could be segmented into two segregated interfacial subdomains: C-terminal residues (673\u2013683) are hydrophobic-at-interface and N-terminal residues (664\u2013672) include a stretch whose face shows strong affinity for membranes if folded into an \u03b1-helix, i.e., an amphipathic-at-interface helix (Lorizate et al., 2006a, Saez-Cirion et al., 2003). Supporting the functional relevance of this organization, a number of fusion-blocking deletions described by Salzwedel et al. correlated with the ablation and/or merging of interfacial sub-domains (Saez-Cirion et al., 2003, Salzwedel et al., 1999). Later reported NMR structures confirmed the predicted MPER segmentation into two short helical subdomains (Sun et al., 2008).",

This indicates that MPER insertion into membranes is not only a structure-related pattern, but also a requirement for the fulfillment of a membrane disrupting function during fusion. In addition, a number of studies employing model membranes and MPER-based synthetic peptides have shown that these membrane-perturbing activities are finely modulated by the lipid composition and the MPER segmentation into hydrophobic subdomains (Apellaniz et al., 2009, Apellaniz et al., 2010, Apellaniz et al., 2011a, Apellaniz et al., 2011b, Ivankin et al., 2012, Saez-Cirion et al., 2002, Shnaper et al., 2004, Suarez et al., 2000b). Taken together, these data point to a fusion model where MPER interfacial activity might help remodeling of the merging membranes along the fusion pathway by sustaining transient disruption of lipid continuity (Saez-Cirion et al., 2002, Shnaper et al., 2004) (Fig. 1B-(2)). Alternatively, it has been suggested that MPER insertion might generate the bulging out of the viral membrane, while the curved end-caps of such bulges would be highly fusogenic (Buzon et al., 2010, Kozlov et al., 2010) (Fig. 1B-(4)).",

The recently published SOSIP structure does not exclude such possibility (Julien et al., 2013). The fact that the FP stabilizes relevant structures of the MPER epitope targeted by the broadly neutralizing 2F5 antibody supports the interaction between both regions, and might as well have implications for the design of peptide immunogens (Huarte et al., 2012, Julien et al., 2008).",

In the most amply studied case of the HIV, interference with formation of structurally defined oligomeric complexes was invoked to explain the inhibitory effect exerted by short synthetic FPs in cell systems (Kliger et al., 1997, Owens et al., 1990, Pritsker et al., 1998, Slepushkin et al., 1993). Gomara and co-workers followed this idea to develop a functional screening assay (Gomara et al., 2006). These authors took the advantage that in-membrane self-oligomerization of HIV-FP is required to establish permeating pores in vesicles made of anionic phospholipid (Nieva et al., 1994). Thus, they used leakage of aqueous contents induced by the synthetic HIV-FP as a surrogate assay for self-oligomerization in membranes. Subsequently, a D-hexapeptide library was screened for its capacity to block FP-induced leakage (for a description of this assay see also (Huarte et al., 2011)). Using this approach two hexapeptides were identified that blocked gp41-induced fusion, thereby supporting the FP region as a potential target for inhibitor development.",

Further MDS analyses supported the establishment of specific \u03b2-sheet/\u03b1-helix interactions between both sequences within the membrane (Bloch et al., 2007). Thus, hetero-association with the TCR\u03b1 TMD and ensuing immunosuppression may reflect that, behind the conventional membrane fusion, a hidden HIV-FP life might exist, also of relevance under pathological conditions.",
