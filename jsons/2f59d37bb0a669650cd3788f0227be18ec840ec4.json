Melanosomes are responsible for synthesis, storage, and transport of melanin. The main roles of melanin are pigmentation (skin, hair and eye color) and defense mechanism against ultraviolet radiation and mechanostress [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Unlike retinal epithelial cells where melanosomes are matured and the pigment is settled during development, melanocytes in skin and hair continuously produce melanosomes throughout life [1] . Originating from endosomes, melanosome is a member of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) and shares some characteristics and pathways with those of lysosome; similarities include biogenesis, maturation, trafficking (exo/endocytosis), recycling and migration [6, 7] . However, melanosome biogenesis exhibits unique processes and specifically takes place in melanocytes. Newly mature melanosomes migrate from melanocytes to keratinocytes, resulting in pigmentation of epithelial cells ( Fig. 1 ) [1, 6, 8] . As there are multiple processes, several protein molecules are involved in melanosome biogenesis, trafficking, and migration. Alterations of each corresponding molecule undoubtedly contribute to the variation of skin and eye color as well as ocular and dermatological diseases such as retinal pigment epitheliopathy, albinism, hyperpigmentation disorders, and skin cancers [4, 9, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 358, "end": 361, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 366, "end": 369, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 567, "end": 570, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 835, "end": 837, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1070, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1073, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1076, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1455, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1458, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1462, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1058, "end": 1064, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Membrane transport proteins (i.e., transporters, channels and pumps) in melanosomes have shown strong correlations to melanosome biogenesis.

TYR function is solely dependent on neutral pH and the existence of Cu 2+ as a cofactor. All ion transport proteins play significant roles in this respect. ATP7A simply transports Cu 2+ to supply Cu 2+ to TYR. OCA2, SLC45A2 and TPC2 (perhaps also SLC24A5) are important for pH maintenance.

In 2001,Newton, et    al. discovered SLC45A2 as a responsible gene for human type IV OCA (OCA4) and mouse \"underwhite\"[83]. At the same time, Fukamachi, et al. found that SLC45A2 is a gene for allele b, a well-known hypopigmentation allele in medaka[84]. SLC45A2 (530 amino acid residues), predicted to contain 12-transmembrane domains, is a member of H + /sugar cotransporter family (SLC45 family). SLC45 mRNA expresses in eyes, skin, placenta, liver, and kidney (The Human Protein Atlas project: http://www.proteinatlas.org, last update March 2020)[82]. In melanocytes, SLC45A2 is expressed in stage III -IV melanosomes[37].The function of SLC45A2 in melanosomes is still largely unclear. Recombinantly expressed mouse SLC45A2 mediates sugar transport at the plasma membrane of yeast cells, with the optimal function at a wide pH range. The sucrose transport is H + dependent, supporting the property of SLC45 as a H + -coupled sugar transporter[36]. A rice-homolog protein also transports sugar in the plasma membrane of oocytes[85]. Although SLC45A2 and the ortholog are proposed to be sugar transporters, the activities were observed at the plasma membrane. Thus, physiological transport function and kinetic property of SLC45A2, expressed in melanosomes, has not been demonstrated.The role of SLC45A2 in melanosomes is well defined. Costin, et al. showed that SLC45A2 promotes TYR trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to melanosomes. The defect of SLC45A2 (underwhite) disrupts the TYR secretion process [86]. Dooley, et al. describes that SLC45A2 regulates pH and melanogenesis. Albino zebrafish has a SLC45A2 mutation and a defect of TYR function. The phenotypes can be rescued by inhibition of V-ATPase or SLC45A2 RNA reinjection [35]. Bin, et al. supports the role of SLC45A2 in pH regulation. The knockdown of SLC45A2 does not affect melanosomal morphology but induces melanosomal acidification that interrupts TYR activity [37].The role of SLC45A2 in melanogenesis is similar to that of OCA2-to promote TYR trafficking and positively regulate pH neutralization for TYR activity. Although both aspects could be independent, the role of SLC45A2 in the pH regulation is certain. Based on the current information, SLC45A2 is predicted to efflux H + from melanosomes(Fig. 3)[36,37,85]. If so, the H + efflux by SLC45A2 reduces melanosomal H + concentration driven by V-ATPase, thereby neutralizing the melanosomal pH. Because SLC45A2 likely transports sugar, a significant agent for osmotic concentration, SLC45A2 may control both pH and osmolarity[87].SLC45A2 does not only play a role in melanogenesis, but also acts as a suppressor of cancer invasion. Because SLC45A2 was discovered to be a deleted gene in melanoma, SLC45A2 has been suggested to play a role in cancer prevention or suppression.

The first possibility is that SLC24A5 in trans-Golgi network plays a role in pH regulation by functional coupling with NHE7 and V-ATPase. This functional coupling may ensure the TYR maturation and proper trafficking of TYR from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes[97]. Another possibility is based on SLC24A5 localization in melanosomes as mentioned in the previous section; Polymorphism of SLC24A5 is related to regions. A111 is found to be associated with light skin pigmentation among European and East Asians. The variation is approximately 20 -40% of European-African difference in skin melanin index.
