Its first target, to halve the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day, remains the key feature of the overall MDG commitment to poverty reduction. The origins of this poverty threshold are rooted in World Bank research around 1990, when this figure was a typical national poverty line used for lowincome countries. 1 Major efforts have been made since 1990 to improve the quality and availability of poverty data. Meanwhile, the international poverty line now stands at $1.25 because of changes in purchasing power parity estimates. 1 The other two targets of MDG1 received much less attention than poverty incidence in the process leading up to the development of MDG1. Indeed, the employment target 1B was added only later at the 2005 UN World Summit.",

Karshenas 3 and Sala-i-Martin 4 also point out inconsistencies between estimates of consumption from household survey data (which are the basis for poverty estimates) and national accounts data (which are used for most other national economic analysis, including growth estimates), with the latter, for instance, estimating consistently lower poverty incidence in China (relative to the former from 1990 onwards) and generally faster rates of poverty reduction.",

Although performance on this indicator is significantly related to food security (defined in terms of access to food, and its nutritional quality and utilisation), hunger itself (defined in terms of access to food) is more closely associated with indicator 1.9, on which there has been less progress. FAO publishes data 6 on indicator 1.9 (proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption) but there are methodological difficulties that make it a poor measure of hunger or food insecurity. It is estimated from limited empirical and sometimes poor quality information on national food supplies and on food access relative to food needs in food insecure households of different sizes and compositions. 5 These problems in capturing hunger as a measurable indicator have stimulated further work on indicators.",

For example, the NER in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 58% in 2000 to 74% in 2007; and in Southern Asia from 79% to 90% over the same period. 10 These positive results need to be interpreted with caution. The NERs are calculated on the basis of student participation in a cycle or stage of education, and not by grade of enrolment. This can be misleading since high NERs can be achieved when very large numbers of overage children enrol in the early grades of education and drop out soon after. While the second indicator of progress towards MDG2-the proportion of pupils starting Grade 1 who reach the last grade of primaryaddresses this concern to some extent this indicator is extremely difficult to assess in systems characterised by late entry, dropout and grade repetition. 11 In Uganda, Malawi and Tanzania where the introduction of free primary education has led to spectacular increases in enrolment in Grade 1, survival rates through the subsequent grades of primary have worsened and the proportion who are seriously overage in primary school (and unlikely to complete primary successfully) has often increased. There is also evidence that in some countries, where overall enrolments have increased, more of the gain has been from the richer rather than poorer households. The use of NERs as an indicator is blind to this important dynamic. 12 The generally positive global trend in NER masks considerable variation between and within countries. In the sub-Saharan Africa region, Eritrea, Liberia and Niger report NERs of less than 50% in 2007, while Madagascar, Mauritius, Uganda and Tanzania report NERs of 95% or more. In the South and West Asia region Pakistan and Bangladesh report NERs of 66% and 87% respectively. 11 Within countries NERs vary widely by income group and gender. In general, children from richer families, and boys, are more likely to enrol and reach the end of primary education than children from poorer families, and girls. Wealth and gender patterns vary widely between countries.",

            "text": "Beyond these uncertainties in the interpretation of results, there are more profound issues with the simple target set for MDG2. While a target that all children complete primary schooling was over-ambitious, it was also modest in that it aimed for universality of only primary level education (first five or six years of schooling). There is accumulating evidence that in many countries the pattern of economic returns to education has changed. In wage employment the return to each extra year of education now is typically lowest at the primary level and it generally increases with level of education, ie, the earnings increment from an extra year of education is significantly higher at secondary and tertiary education levels than at the primary. 13 Even noneconomic returns of education, eg, in terms of women's fertility, are higher from secondary education compared with those from primary education. 14, 15 Second, in focusing on the completion of five years of schooling, MDG2's target failed to place appropriate emphasis on learning. Enrolment in school is not the same as regularly attending school. Attending school is not the same as participating in learning opportunities, either because the teaching-learning environment is impoverished or because the child is hungry/sick and unable to take advantage of the opportunity. And participation in learning is not the same as the achievement of learning outcomes that are useful, relevant or enduring. In the few developing countries for which data on achievement levels are available, it is clear that average learning levels among school-going children are low. [16] [17] [18] While the third indicator of MDG2 ('literacy among 15-24 year olds') captures learning to some extent, aiming for mere literacy, which in many settings is interpreted as ability to read one's name, is surely setting the bar too low. It is higher order cognitive skills-as tested in standardised tests of reading, maths and science-that are shown to be related to individual earnings, national economic growth and non-market outcomes such as low fertility, low child mortality and improved child health. 18, 19 Third, the overemphasis on the target distracts attention from the means by which the target can be achieved. A wide range of policy issues need to be addressed if targets are to be reached. In most countries the supply and training of teachers has not kept pace with enrolment growth. And in countries with large numbers of small schools, curricula, pedagogy, teacher deployment and teacher education cry out for urgent reform by national and local authorities. 20 Equally, policies to promote children's attendance at school and participation in learning are required at the local authority and school level.",

MDG3's educational indicators particularly address this perspective, and reflect a longstanding commitment to reducing gender discrimination, eg, the 1981 Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), as well as a widespread 'commonsense' view circulating in World Bank and UNDP circles in the 1990s that women's education was a key to all development problems. 25 In the women's rights perspective, gender equality in education is intended to enhance women's rights and wider social mobilisation to redress poverty and inequality and promote the empowerment of women, ie, more than just getting girls into school. This perspective was a major element of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted at the third World Conference on Women in 1995. MDG3's indicators on the share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector and proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments addressed this perspective.",

This proved to be a poisoned chalice. The date was far too early for the MDG message to have been internalised by governments and civil society and took little account of the resources that would be required and the poor understanding of the range of local issues that kept children out of school. In 2005 the gender parity in education target was missed in 74 countries. There was no major global outcry.

For example, the GPI in the NER in secondary education was 0.72 in Eritrea, 0.82 in Nigeria and 0.83 in Mozambique, while in Afghanistan the GPI of NER was 0.38 and in Pakistan it was 0.76. 11 Achievements have also occurred in expanding access for women to tertiary education in many regions. 11 However, measures mask difficulties in access for women from the lowest economic quintiles and from groups that had historically experienced discrimination. 28, 29 Large gender gaps in tertiary enrolments were also evident in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 11 A task force set up in 2005 to review MDG3 reaffirmed the interdependence of MDG3 and other MDGs, and added a number of gender-related priorities to those already captured in the targets. 30 This 'MDG3 plus' agenda gained the support of the World Bank and UNDP, and had the following elements with a broader set of additional indicators. The suggested indicators to be added were gender and primary completion; under-five mortality (gender disaggregated); youth (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) and adult labour force participation (by gender); average hourly wage; percentage of women of reproductive age and partners using modern contraception; and percentage of 15-19 year old girls who are young mothers or pregnant with their first child. 31 Assessing progress on these indicators in 2006 indicated that no region of the world had extensive levels of gender equality. The 2008 MDG report did not report on progress against all this broader list of indicators, sticking simply to the initial four indicators of gender parity in primary and secondary education, tertiary education, non-agricultural wage employment, and women in national parliament. A debate over the datasets to be used for the 'MDG3 plus' indicators has been one factor limiting their implementation.",

They set up, improved, and/or scrutinised their education management information systems (EMIS) to examine whether they were achieving gender parity in primary and secondary education. There is considerable debate about the value of emphasising these educational targets. [34] [35] [36] That part of MDG3 focused on a women's rights perspective, with its associated indicators relating to employment and parliamentary representation, has been largely ignored as governments focused on the \"low hanging fruit\" of increasing enrolment of girls in schools. In most countries, political decision making continues to be dominated by men, and 58 countries have 10% or fewer women members of Parliament. However, exceptional progress has been made in Rwanda, where women occupy 56% of parliamentary seats, 37 and Spain, where the new cabinet sworn in by Prime Minister Zapatero in 2008 had more women than men-a first for Europe. 8 While the expanded 'MDG plus' agenda did bring in new indicators that better addressed the women's rights/ Beijing agenda, the fact that these did not even feature in the MDG mid-point review raises questions regarding their ownership. As a result, the women's rights movement has been divided on whether to ignore the MDGs altogether, as 'most distracting gimmicks' 38 or whether to engage tactically with the MDG process 39 to steer them towards the Beijing Platform's agenda on women's rights and governmental accountability for their delivery. 22, 40 A number of studies point out that even the 'MDG3 plus' agenda does not sufficiently address key vulnerabilities of poor women particularly their reliance on a monetarised economy, their environmental risks, competition for space and services, intra-household allocations and violence against women. 41, 42 On the positive side, aid organisations have used MDG3 to give prominence to gender in their programmes. For countries to qualify for Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), for instance, donors require a discussion of gender and strategies for improving parity, but the gender element is often focused on a few areas, largely schooling. However, some aid agencies have used MDG3 to give substantial support to the wider gender agenda of Education for All through, for example, funding for Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) in Africa, establishing the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI) based in UNICEF, and support for Camfed (Campaign for Female Education) in selected African countries.",

In 1980, UNICEF published, for the first time, national, regional and global estimates for child mortality which, despite the weakness of the data available, rallied world opinion behind its call for a 'Child Survival Revolution'. 45 This initiative promoted Growth monitoring, Oral rehydration, Breast feeding, Immunization (GOBI). 46 Various regional and global goals were devised, the best known of which was Universal Childhood Immunization (UCI) which had been originally adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1977. 47 The goal of UCI stimulated a considerable global effort and its goals were considered by most as having been achieved. 48 Global goals on child survival were first proposed at the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, which agreed a set of global child mortality goals based on a reduction in infant and under-five child mortality rates by one-third, or to 50 and 70 per 1000 live births by 2000, but these gained little support and, with the perceived UCI achievement, child survival could be seen as lower priority for organisations like UNICEF and WHO in the 1990s. More ambitious child survival targets were proposed at the UN International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994. These were taken to the Millennium Summit in 2000, evolving ultimately into MDG4.",

These could then be applied to tools such as the Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks (MBB) tool 50 to identify bottlenecks and to cost and budget for various child survival interventions to achieve their impacts on reducing mortality.

The Countdown to 2015 initiative has been charged with monitoring progress in 68 high priority countries. 52 Of those 68 countries, only 16 have been judged to be 'on track' to achieve MDG4, while a further 26 were judged to be making some progress but insufficient to achieve MDG4. Only one sub-Saharan African country, Eritrea, is said to be on track, yet a close examination of that country raises serious concerns about the degree of mortality under-reporting, especially of neonatal mortality, as the lowest socioeconomic quintile reports lower mortality rates than two wealthier quintiles. 53 Indeed, close examination of other countries said to be on track raises concerns about the data quality. China reports unlikely dramatic declines in child mortality, including a 48% decline in mortality in just 5 years between 2002 and 2007. 54 Murray and colleagues conducted a detailed analysis of the period before and after the MDGs were launched and concluded that the impact on child mortality has been minimal. 55 Most child survival interventions rely on the existence of a functioning health service. 56 In most developing countries the health service only reaches a proportion of the population. Thus repeated interventions delivered through the health service are likely to reach the same populations, and by implication those outside the reach of the health services will continue to miss out. 57 It follows then that repeated application of interventions through the health services will serve to increase the mortality gap in a community leading to increasing inequity in child survival. There is now strong evidence that this is indeed taking place. 58 As 2015 approaches, there is a real danger that we may see a repeat of the experience seen with UCI in the 1980s whereby the increasing use of short-term child survival strategies to achieve a fixed goal is followed by a sudden loss of interest among the same politicians whose enthusiasm has driven MDG4. Any last-minute push to get closer to the targets with short term measures is likely to exacerbate inequity in child survival, as the efforts will likely be focusing on 'low-hanging fruits' while ignoring those in greatest need.",

This was almost certainly using data of very poor quality, which was more likely to have been affected by political issues of the 1980s than by real progress. For African countries with limited infrastructure, this is particularly true. For example, Niger has seen a decline in child mortality of 67 deaths per 1000, yet this is judged as insufficient progress as it represents only a 21% decline from 1990 levels. 52 While MDG4 may have increased support for child survival strategies in the developing world it has also set up many countries for failure from unrealistic targets. There are a number of major problems with the structure, implementation, and evaluation of MDG4. Data on child mortality in the poorest countries is notoriously poor, especially for neonatal mortality which appears to be systematically underestimated in many areas. There is a natural tendency for repeated application of different child survival interventions to increase inequity. The lack of reference to inequity, and weak monitoring of trends in inequity are major problems with MDG4. Finally the growing proximity of the deadline for MDG4 is likely to see the application of increasingly short-term strategies, many of which may not be sustainable.",

In 1987 the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) was launched and conference attendees heard of the 500 000 maternal deaths which occurred annually. The goal subsequently articulated was to prevent maternal mortality and related morbidities, and to promote a healthy woman and newborn. The target set was to reduce maternal deaths by 50% by 2000, coinciding with the Alma Ata target of health for all by 2000. 59 The indicator chosen, the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), fitted with a view that had emerged in the 1980s suggesting that targeted mortality foci and 'vertical' health initiatives were successful (eg, the Child Survival revolution), but it also addressed an adult cause-of-death affecting economically productive individuals, a priority encouraged by the World Bank. 24 The MMR target was raised when maternal health was included in the OECD DAC's international development targets, 60 which led to MDG5. Its association with Skilled Birth Attendants (SBAs) at delivery derives from a recommendation of the 1997 SMI meeting. Countries with high proportions of women attended by skilled health workers at delivery have low maternal mortality. 61 In practice, and in most countries, this means institutional deliveries. 62 ",

Nor have credible efforts been made to improve access to Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) for women with complications. Rather, actions in support of MDG5 often attempt to bypass a facility-based health system by seeking community-based solutions, such as educating women on warning signs of complications, or training traditional birth attendants or community volunteers. There is little evidence that scale-up of such community-based pro-grammes will yield meaningful reductions in maternal deaths but they appeal to some donors and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), not least because they promise equitable access for marginalised rural poor populations. Support for antenatal care was maintained over the period but family planning and reproductive health stagnated in the face of hostility by the Bush administration. 64 In 2008, target 5B -aimed at universal access to reproductive health-was added as a result of efforts by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and a large constituency of NGOs working in family planning and reproductive health. The 1996 OECD DAC had also included these reproductive health targets initially proposed by the 1994 ICPD, but these were not initially adopted as part of the MDGs because they were contested by a coalition opposed to reproductive rights, led by the US amongst others. Target 5B supports maternal and neonatal health services by including an indicator of antenatal care coverage, but also addresses family planning by using indicators for reducing unmet need, increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate and reducing adolescent pregnancy. Support for family planning in the MDGs has come very late for political reasons, and its substantial potential impact has not been realised. The maternal health community always recognised that access to contraception and safe induced abortion services would reduce a subset of maternal deaths, but sought care for all women including those who wanted to give birth, particularly those needing emergency obstetric care.",

The low status of women may underlie all of these shortcomings, coupled with a lack of financing and human resources.",

This bundle of international environmental priorities was incorporated into the OECD DAC's international development targets. 60 This would later become MDG7, with inclusion of targets for improving water provision and conditions for slum dwellers, taken from the World Water Forum's Ministerial Conference, and the UN/World Bank initiative 'Cities without Slums' in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

            "text": "Targets 7A and 7B are, by contrast, imprecise, qualitative and overlapping-what kind of policy change needs to be achieved, what rate of biodiversity loss needs to be measured and changed? There is also considerable inconsistency in the association of indicators with targets. The distribution of targets and indicators in Table 1 is that provided by the UN Statistics Division, 83 the official UN site. By contrast, UNDP put all the indicators under 7B. 84 Without identifying changes to be achieved, the indicators in Targets 7A and 7B simply highlight areas for monitoring environmental change. As such, MDG7 may be contributing to recent growth in environmental monitoring which is making use of advances in earth observation, computing and geographical information systems, but it is not stimulating directed action or policy change. The World Bank has recently developed two measures of change in environmental policy which suggest an approach to a more directed implementation of these targets: an Environmental Performance Index which ranks countries on policies relative to broadly accepted targets in environmental health, air pollution, water resources biodiversity, productive natural resources and climate change, and a Country Policy and Institutional Assessment which tracks national environmental policies for different sectors, eg, the adequacy of prioritisation or the level of public information and participation. 85 Analysis It is likely that the global target on access to drinking water will be met or exceeded. If current trends continue, by 2015 86% of the population in developing regions will have gained access to improved sources of drinking water. Most progress has been made in rural areas, where most problems with access, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, remain. Sanitation has historically received comparatively less attention from governments than water, and this target is unlikely to be met globally, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa facing the greatest challenges. While the population that uses an improved sanitation facility has more than doubled between 1990 and 2006 in South Asia and increased by over 80% in Africa, 10 an estimated 2.6 billion still lacked access to such a facility in 2008 and most improved access has been concentrated in wealthier parts of the population. 86 Progress with slum dwellers has been measured relative to provision of four basic amenities: clean water, improved sanitation, durable housing and adequate living space-the lack of at least one of these defines a slum. Against this metric, the lives of slum dwellers have improved in almost all regions, much of which is associated with improved water supply and sanitation. Africa, where slums are often characterised by a lack of several of the above amenities, remains the region with greatest challenges. Overall, while the proportion of urban populations living in slums has declined from 39% to 33% between 2000 and 2010, the rapid growth in urban populations means that the overall number of slum dwellers is still increasing. 85 For targets 7A and 7B, UN MDG progress reports tend to present general data on environmental trends, assessed by different studies over varying timescales. All trends show a decline in recent years in forests, fisheries, biodiversity, and water-all natural resources where MDG7 has targeted reduction or reversal in loss. The target to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 has not been met and, if anything, biodiversity loss is accelerating. Over the same period, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. MDG7 reports can, however, celebrate the successful reduction by 97% of the consumption of substances that deplete the Earth's ozone layer, towards which 175 country signatories of the Montreal Protocol contributed in a process that predates the MDGs. 10 In summary, while there has been substantial progress against targets involving drinking water, sanitation and housing, progress on environmental targets has been virtually non-existent. A number of features of Targets 7A and 7B may contribute to this dismal record. Firstly, there is a poor link between these targets and measures of human development or economic growth. Without a way to link reducing environmental degradation directly to human benefit, governments are unlikely to make the commitments to MDG7 that they make to MDGs on education, health and poverty. New tools to do this are emerging, including the concept of \"ecosystem services\" promoted by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 87 which places a value on those services which ecosystems provide, eg, clean water and air, biodiversity for breeding crops and livestock, and the concept of \"environmental mainstreaming\" in development agendas. 88 Unfortunately these mechanisms came too late to guide the design of indicators for Targets 7A and 7B.",

Targets are characterised as \"general objectives\" rather than \"concrete policy changes\". 92 Even reports produced by the UN system-the instigator and main supporter of the MDG framework-criticise the lack of \"quantitative targets\" and inconsistency among MDG8's targets. 93 The confusion is pervasive, especially because of the different ways of interpreting changing commitments post-2000. 93 For example, should pledges about trade, aid and debt reached at Monterrey in 2002 and Gleneagles in 2005 be subsumed within MDG8 in keeping with its generic targets on those issues, or should they be judged as separate benchmarks?",

Today total aid remains far below the UN's target of 0.7 GNI, with only five countries reaching this benchmark. 8 The collapse of the Doha trade round has also undermined the likelihood of significantly better market access for developing countries. Likewise, the downturn is exacerbating the number of people unable to obtain affordable medicines. 93 Accelerating progress towards MDG8 has now become an \"emergency\". 93 Despite these setbacks, the latest UN report on the MDGs records some progress regarding debt relief: the ratio of debt service to exports remained stable or fell in most developing regions in 2008, 40 countries are eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and debt burdens are expected to remain \"well below historical levels\". 8 The current failings of MDG8 and its omissions have provoked alternative suggestions to improve a global development partnership. Fukuda-Parr has called for an \"urgent\" realignment to the challenges identified in the Monterrey consensus, and a shift from \"charity\" to \"solidarity\". 92 She has also urged for more developing county voice and participation in decision-making, including at the WTO. 92 The UNFPA has expressed regret that international migration, including issues such as diasporas and the brain drain, does not feature within MDG8. 95 Others have argued for more, and better, spending of ODA as both trends complement each other. 92 The MDG Gap Task Force predicts that the downturn will galvanise action by providing \"an opportunity to accelerate delivery on agreed commitments and improve the distribution of benefits where these are wanting\". 93 Experiences so far, MDG8's lack of precision, and the unfolding consequences of the economic crisis suggest that this optimism is misplaced.",
