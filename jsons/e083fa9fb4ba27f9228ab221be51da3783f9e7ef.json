Nevertheless, this is limiting as these resources only facilitate medicalrelated concept extraction. To this end, we utilised DBpedia concepts (entity names) that was originally acquired from Wikipedia articles for concept identification. The reason for selecting DBpedia 1 as the main resource [1] for concept extraction is due to its dynamic and fast-growing nature [22] . Therefore, new knowledge is constantly added to DBpedia irrespective of the domain, which makes DBpedia an up-to-date resource [25] . The reason for selecting DBpedia concepts as the main data unit of concept extraction is that it represents Wikipedia article titles which is well-formed and succinct that resembles a term in a conventional thesaurus [11] . We considered the entire English DBpedia concepts as our initial vocabulary. The concept extraction was performed by mapping the longest contiguous sequence of tokens in a sentence with the corresponding concept in the vocabulary. The extracted concepts are stored in its original order of the sentence to preserve the contextual information that is useful in semantic shifts analysis.",

Redirects are a special type of articles used in DBpedia that are originated from Wikipedia to group equivalent concepts of the main article to ensure that only one article exists for a particular concept [25] . In addition to alternative terms, redirects also handle abbreviations (e.g., Insulin-like growth factor 1 vs. IGF-1 ) and spelling variations (e.g., raynaud disease vs. raynaud's disease). For example, consider the concept Raynaud disease where DBpedia is currently having nearly 30 synonymous terms 2 . We used such synonyms terms in our Query Expansion phase to ensure that all the relevant articles related to the input topics A and C are retrieved to ensure the richness of our local topic coverage. In other words, the synonymous terms are connected using or operator to devise the expanded search query that is used to obtain the query specific local literature.",

It is clear that most of the immediate categories of Raynaud disease (i.e. via dct:subject property) quickly reaches (i.e. using less number of hops) the main domain concept Medicine via skos:broader property. Therefore, we decide a concept as a domain-related terminology if majority of its immediate categories reaches the domain concept with less than or equal to 8 hops. From our empirical analysis we observed that concepts such as Operant conditioning 3 (even though not directly relevant to Medical domain), have majority of distant categories that reaches the main domain concept Medicine. To avoid inclusion of such concepts as discipline-related terminology, we also impose a rule that the concept should have at least one immediate category that reaches the domain concept with less than or equal to 4 hops.",

Hence, employing a hierarchical level filtering as in MeSH is not possible in DBpedia. However, from our empirical analysis, we observed that less granular terms have high indegree page links.

Thus, this measure captures how well the concept (w i ) make semantic relationships not only with the input two topics, but also with its recent core meaning. Therefore, this measure provides the opportunity to evaluate the need of assessing the semantic neighbourhood of the input topics in LBD context. Neighbourhood Semantic Proximity This measure extends the idea of Pairwise Distance Proximity measure by incorporating the recent neighbourhood of topic A (w A ) and C (w C ) (see Fig. 6 (b) ). More specifically, this measure verifies whether the concept's (w i ) temporal trajectory inclines not just to topic A and C, but also to their semantic neighbours. ",

Similar to prior LBD studies [7] , we used the two standard evaluation measures used in information retrieval tasks; precision@k and Mean Average Precision@k to quantify the results. Table 7 summarises the Precision@k results for all the five golden datasets. The k value is gradually increased from 10 to 100. Table 8 includes the Mean Average Precision@k results obtained for the five golden test cases. ",
