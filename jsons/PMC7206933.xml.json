First, the conclusion that RAAS blockers do not modify susceptibility to Covid-19 applies to both sexes as well as to younger and older persons. Second, our data provide no evidence that, rather than modifying the susceptibility to Covid-19, RAAS blockers alter the evolution of the disease, thereby mainly affecting its severity. In our study, neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs showed an independent association with Covid-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate disease or in those with severe disease. Third, patients with Covid-19 had much more frequent use of loop diuretics and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists than controls, and treatment with loop diuretics was associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 in the multivariable analysis. Rather than suggesting an association (for which there is no mechanistic support), this finding is likely to mean that use of loop diuretics reflects the existence of clinical conditions such as heart failure or advanced renal damage, the severity of which was not appropriately quantified by the available clinical data and scores. These observations from our study may account for the independent relationship that was found between Covid-19 and some noncardiovascular drugs, although more direct investigations with appropriate experimental designs would be required to clarify this issue.",

            "text": "Limitations of the study include the fact that information on drug use is limited to prescriptions, and actual drug consumption by the case patients and controls could not be assessed. Drugs that were purchased by the patients (because doctors prescribed them privately, and no records were in the National Health Service system) as well as those dispensed after December 31, 2019, were not captured by our analysis. However, the availability of free antihypertensive agents makes out-of-pocket purchase of these drugs rare, and an exploratory analysis involving patients in whom antihypertensive treatment had been taken regularly or closer to the time of infection did not modify the results. Our results reflect the doses of RAAS blockers used in Italian medical practice but did not allow us to investigate other doses, because this information was not included in the database. It is likely that the control group included some persons with Covid-19, since the general population in Italy was not tested. Unmeasured confounders may have been responsible for our findings. For example, given the hypothesis that RAAS blockers increase the risk of severe clinical manifestations of Covid-19, there may have been preferential dispensation of RAAS blockers to patients with better clinical profiles and a lower perceived likelihood of the development of severe Covid-19. However, there was no evidence that patients who received ARBs or ACE inhibitors had a better clinical profile than those who received other antihypertensive medications. Finally, our results apply to a largely white population and cannot be generalized to other races.",
