            "text": "Avian viral diseases caused by avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD), and Newcastle disease (ND) viruses are a major obstacle in the poultry industry worldwide and result in substantial economic losses, especially in broilers, due to respiratory distress, high mortality, impaired growth, or immune suppression. Furthermore, they have the capability of inducing diseases independently or in concurrent infection with each other (Roussan et al., 2008). AI viruses are classified in the genus Influenza virus of Orthomyxoviridae family (Cox et al., 2000), while the etiology of IBD or Gumboro disease is the IBD virus that is a member of genus Avibirnavirus of the Birnaviridae family (Delmas et al., 2019). IB virus is belonging to Coronavirus genus of family Coronaviridae (Enjuanes et al., 2000), while the cause of ND is ND virus, belonging to genus Avulavirus of Paramyxoviridae family (Hines and Miller, 2012). All these viruses have RNA genome enclosed within either enveloped (AI, IB, and ND viruses) or nonenveloped (IBD virus) capsid. Their outbreaks still occur in the field, although several live, inactivated, or recombinant vaccines are commercially available, and different vaccination programs are applied for each disease (Swayne and King, 2003). Many factors are related to this problem, and one of them is the immune suppression or an immature immune system (Skowronski et al., 2008). Moreover, if a virus is endemic in a region, its elimination is difficult, so additional methods are required to combat these viruses along with vaccination. Recently, there has been increased interest in the use of natural antimicrobial agents, and the use of EOs in combination as a strategy to control many pathogens (Gutierrez et al., 2008). Over 3,000 EOs are known, of which approximately 300 are commercially important and used in the flavour and fragrance industries (Van de Braak and Leijten, 1999, Baghban-Kanani et al., 2019). Essential oils are produced by medicinal plants, and their effects vary based on the component, which may have antibacterial (Sokovic et al., 2010, Qorbanpour et al., 2018), antiviral (Koch et al., 2008, Gado et al., 2019), anticoccidial (Mohiti-Asli and Ghanaatparast-Rashti, 2015), antifungal (Pinto et al., 2006), antioxidant (Nunez et al., 2007), or growth-promoting effects (Abd El-Hack et al., 2016a, Abd El-Hack et al., 2016b, Abd El-Hack et al., 2016c, Abd El-Hack et al., 2018). Nevertheless, Reichlinga et al. (2009) concluded in their review that the most tested essential oils exhibited a clear antiviral activity on enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, while they did not affect the nonenveloped viruses. In addition, there are recent studies proving that EOs can improve the cellular and humoral immune responses of chickens (Lee et al., 2011, Roofchaee et al., 2011). We hypothesized that EOs mixture stimulates immune response to different viral vaccines used in broiler flocks, promotes weight gaining, and can be used to the face the viral outbreaks such as ND virus.",

The improvement of the clinical and pathological picture of vNDv was observed in PRV (received the EOs supplement that was started from 1 D before the challenge and was continued for 5 D); in addition, this group had the lowest oropharyngeal shedding titre (log 10), which could be due to eucalyptus, and it has been used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory tract infections (Cermelli et al., 2008) and may exhibit antiviral activity (Barbour et al., 2010) and thus affects the virulence of the challenge virus. Moreover, EOs showed more protective level against vNDv challenge in PRV (preventive group) than TTT (therapeutic group) that may be attributed to the effect of EOs mixture on ND virus adsorption to cell surface and may block cell receptors resulting in interference with virus binding; its accurate mode of action should be studied through tissue culture.",

Although, VTC showed an improved FCR (1.77 \u00b1 0.03), it did not significantly differ from negative control birds (NC) (1.66 \u00b1 0.04). Vaccination by different live vaccines including ND, IB, and IBD viruses may be the reason for significantly higher FCR in VC (1.89 \u00b1 0.04). The same was observed during 7 D PC for body weight gain and FCR. Nevertheless, the use of ND vaccines, regardless EOs supplementation, has improved (P < 0.05) overall body weight gain in all challenged groups compared with the positive control group. Similar results were obtained by Sedeik et al. (2019). Supplementation of EOs as a preventive drug in PRV (that was started from 1 D before the challenge and continued for 5 D) along with vaccines application has significantly improved the body weight gain compared with positive control birds (PC).",

As well, thymol plus carvacrol has reported to significantly improve body weight gain and FCR in broilers (Hashemipour et al., 2013, Saki et al., 2014). The obtained results of body weight gain and FCR in this study were similar to the findings of Rehman et al., 2013, Toghyani et al., 2010 and Lee et al. (2003). The various results of the effect of different types of EOs on bird performance in several studies could be related to variations of dose, active components of the EOs mixture, the period of administration, and the environmental and nutritional factors.",

In this study, EOs had no significant effect on MDA or SOD in the serum at the 28th D (challenge day), but it caused significant decrease of MDA in PRV and TTT at the 35th D although vNDv challenge did not increase MDA level in PC (positive control). These results make us ask about the role of ND infection on lipid peroxidation and therefore the need for further studies. The decreased level of MDA at the seventh day PC in VTC may be attributed to the antioxidant effect of thyme that is rich in flavonoids (Cook and Samman, 1996). Furthermore, Youdim and Deans, 2000, Botsoglou et al., 2002, and Hashemipour et al. (2013) reported that thymol, carvacrol, thyme oil, and/or oregano have strong antioxidant activity and can inhibit lipid peroxidation.",

Similar results were obtained by Saki et al. (2014) for AI and IB but are not consistent for IBD, which could be due to the use of thyme essence in the drinking water at different doses (0, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mL/L) from 8 to 42 D or the inclusion of different components. The hematological and PA assays were conducted only at the 28th D of age to detect the effect of EOs on the immune response to vaccines (regardless of ND challenge). So, the groups were representing by NC, negative control; VC, vaccinated and nontreated with EOs; and VTC, vaccinated and treated with EOs. One of the first lines of defence in the body is leucocytes, which significantly increase in its number when the infection occurs (Ganong, 2003), like what was observed in this study in VC (vaccinated, nontreated). In addition to the lower H:L ratio in VTC (vaccinated and EOs treated), which may be due to the positive influence of this mixture on reducing stress in broilers. It is known that the H:L ratio is considered as an indicator of stress in poultry (Bedanova et al., 2007). Similar results were reported by Hashemipour et al. (2013). In addition, essential oils were able to increase the PA and index in VTC compared to VC. On the other hand, eucalyptus oil stimulates the immune response by enhancing PA of monocytes (El-Ghousein and Al-Beitawi, 2009). Furthermore, Acamovic and Brooker (2005) claimed that the polyphenol compound EO and thymol have a stimulating effect on mononuclear phagocyte system and cellular immunity.",
