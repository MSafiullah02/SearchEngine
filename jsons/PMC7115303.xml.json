Two hundred twenty-one individuals, predominantly men, were stricken, and 34 died. The investigation that followed identified a new bacterium, which was subsequently named Legionella pneumophila (1, 2). Almost 50 years later, Legionnaires' disease is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States (3). The CDC estimates that between 8,000 and 18,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease occur in the United States annually (4). In addition, between 1995 and 2005, over 32,000 cases were reported to the European Working Group for Legionella Infections (5). It has subsequently been learned that an unidentified gram-negative rod that was frozen in 1947 was later identified as Legionella sp., so the American Legion convention was not the first time Legionella was isolated from humans (6).",

Legionella spp. are not transmitted person to person but through the air and in water. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include fever, a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, rigors, dyspnea, diarrhea, and delirium. Erythromycin and, later, ciprofloxacin were designated the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of legionellosis; however, newer macrolides, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, and newer quinolones, such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin, have also been found to be effective (8).",

Most Legionella strains are oxidase variable and negative (inert, or non-reactive) for most standard biochemicals, such as nitrate reduction, urease, and carbohydrate utilization. Most, however, will liquefy gelatin and are beta-lactamase positive. Lack of activity in standard biochemicals essentially makes phenotypic identification impossible. Confirmation of identification is usually performed by staining with polyvalent conjugates containing monoclonal antibodies against the most common clinical isolates. Therefore, recognizing Legionella morphologically on BCYE and serogrouping the isolate is the most rapid and cost-effective way to diagnose it.",

This technique takes into account the fact that Legionella bacteria may be present at low numbers in certain water samples but will continue growing inside their protozoan hosts. The remaining unconcentrated sample should be incubated at 35\u00b0C and subcultured at 2-week intervals for as long as 6 weeks. This procedure is said to increase the ultimate recovery of Legionella from positive samples by as much as 30%.",

If all cold (chlorinated) water is kept at \u226425\u00b0C (\u226478\u00b0F) and all hot water is kept at \u226551\u00b0C (\u2265124\u00b0F), there should not be any systemic problem with Legionella. However, in most commercial buildings, hot water is maintained at closer to 110\u00b0F because of high energy costs. Electric hot water heaters also do not heat as evenly as gas. The water temperature may be 15 to 20\u00b0F lower at the bottom of the tank than at the top of the heater. Superheating the water to >60\u00b0C (>140\u00b0F) can help diminish the Legionella bioburden for short periods but must be repeated every 3 to 5 weeks. For disinfection, hospitals use 180\u00b0F water for a 2-hour flush. This is performed by zones so that patient care is not affected. Maintaining water temperatures too high (>140\u00b0F) has resulted in patient scalding incidents, so it is not a feasible or a preferred method in hospitals.",
