In this paper, we address the task of multimodal entity linking (MEL), an emerging research field in which textual and visual information is used to map an ambiguous mention to an entity in a knowledge base (KB). First, we propose a method for building a fully annotated Twitter dataset for MEL, where entities are defined in a Twitter KB. Then, we propose a model for jointly learning a representation of both mentions and entities from their textual and visual contexts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by evaluating it on the proposed dataset and highlight the importance of leveraging visual information when it is available.",

            "text": "Entity linking (EL) is a crucial task for natural language processing applications that require disambiguating named mentions within textual documents. It consists in mapping ambiguous named mentions to entities defined in a knowledge base (KB). To address the EL problem, most of the state-of-the-art approaches use some form of textual representations associated with the target mention and its corresponding entity. [3] first proposed to link a named mention to an entity in a knowledge base, followed by several other local approaches [9, 10, 14, 15, 35] where mentions are individually disambiguated using lexical mention-entity measures and context features extracted from their surrounding text. In contrast, global approaches [19, 21, 39, 42] use global features at the document-level to disambiguate all the mentions within the document and can also exploit semantic relationships between entities in the KB. These approaches have shown their effectiveness on standard EL datasets such as TAC KBP [27] , CoNLL-YAGO [23] , and ACE [2] which contain structured documents that provide a rich context for disambiguation. However, EL becomes more challenging when a limited, informal, textual context is available, such as in social media posts. On the other hand, social media posts often include images to illustrate the text that could be exploited to improve the disambiguation by adding a visual context. The example depicts a subset of (text, image) pairs representing the entity @AndrewNg (left), and some example of (text, image) pairs related to the mention Andrew (right).",

We propose to apply MEL on Twitter posts as they form a prototypical framework where the textual context is generally poor and visual information is available. Indeed, an important mechanism in Twitter communication is the usage of a user's screen name (@UserScreenName) in a tweet text. This helps to explicitly mention that the corresponding user is somehow related to the posted tweet. One observation we made is that some Twitter users tend to mention other users without resorting to screen names but rather use their first name, last name, or acronyms (when the Twitter user is an organization). Consider the following example tweet (see Fig. 1 ):",

Collective approaches are preferred and leverage global information about tweets in relation with the target mention. [33] collectively resolves a set of mentions by aggregating all their related tweets to compute mention-mention and mention-entity similarities while [25] takes advantage of both semantic relatedness and mention co-referencing. In a more original way, [44] determines the user's topics of interest from all its posted tweets in order to collectively link all its named entity mentions. Similarly [24] considers social (user's interest + popularity) and temporal contexts. Other collective approaches include in their EL model additional non-textual features. For example, [16] and [6] use global information of tweets that are close in space and time to the tweet of the target mention. Finally, [13] proposes a joint cross-document co-reference resolution and disambiguation approach including temporal information associated with their corpus to improve EL performance. While these works yield interesting results using non-textual features, they often depend on the availability of social data and do not exploit visual information.",

The dataset creation process comprises two phases: the construction of the knowledge base and the generation of ambiguous mentions.

From this initial list of users, we started building the KB by collecting the tweets of each user's timeline along with its meta-information ensuring that both re-tweets and tweets without images were discarded. Moreover, as explained previously, users tend to create ambiguous mentions in tweets when they employ any expression (for example first or last name) other than Twitter screen names to mention other users in their post (see Sect. 1). Consequently, we have drawn inspiration from this usage to elaborate a simple process for both candidate entity and ambiguous mention generation.",

Then, we used these names as search queries in the Twitter API user search engine to collect data about similar users 3 . Users that have been inactive for a long period, non-English users and non-verified user accounts were filtered. Furthermore, to ensure more diversity in the entities and not only use person names, we manually collected data about organization accounts.

Given the resulting collections of tweets mentioning the different entities of the KB, we systematically replaced the screen name mentioned in the tweet with its corresponding ambiguous mention: last names for person entities and acronyms for organization entities. Finally, we kept track of the ground truths of each tweet in the dataset reducing the cost of a manual annotation task and resulting in a dataset composed of annotated pairs of text and image. Although ambiguous mentions are synthetically generated, they are comparable to some extent with real-world ambiguous mentions in tweets. We applied a named entity recognition (NER) system [12] on the tweets of the dataset which achieved a 77% accuracy score on the generated mentions. This suggests that these latter are somehow close to real-world named mentions.",

Regarding mention tweets, a key factor in the reduction is the elimination of noisy tweets where mentions have no syntactic role in the tweet text (e.g. where the mention is included in a list of recipients of the message). Discarding these irrelevant tweets as well as tweets without image left a dataset of 2M timeline tweets and 85k mention tweets. After 3 months of data collection, we found that only 10% of tweet posts are accompanied by images. In the end, we randomly split the set of mention tweets into training (40%), validation (20%) and test (40%) while ensuring that 50% of mention tweets in the test set correspond to entities unseen during the training. Table 1 shows the timeline tweet distribution of all entities in our KB. As noted by [24] , this distribution reveals that most Twitter users are information seekers, i.e. they rarely tweet, in contrast to users that are content generators who tweet frequently. Along with user's popularity, this has an influence on the number of mention tweets we can collect. We necessarily gathered more mention tweets from content generator entities, as they are more likely to be mentioned by others than information seeker entities.",

Each sub-model has a structure resembling the similarity model proposed by [47] , i.e., it comprises three branches (unigram embedding, bigram embedding, image feature), each in turn including 2 fully connected (FC) layers with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation followed by a normalization layer [32] . Then, the output vectors of the three branches are merged using concatenation, followed by a final FC layer. Other merging approaches exist such as element-wise product and compact bilinear pooling [17, 47] . However, in our work, simple concatenation showed satisfying results as a first step. Moreover, the mention and entity inputs differ in our task, a mention being characterized by one (text, image) pair and an entity by a large set of (text, image) pairs. Thus, we investigated the performance of our model when the parameters of the two sub-models are partially or fully shared.

As 50% of mentions are unique in each split of our dataset, we do not take the standard most frequent entity prediction as a baseline, which links the entity that was seen most in For easy readability, we use the S2V notation to represent the combination of S2V-uni and S2V-bi Img Similarity measured between the image features extracted using the pretrained Inception-V3 model ET(X ) Combination of features X using an Extra-Trees classifier JMEL(X ) Combination of features X with our joint multimodal representation model (see Sect. 5.2) training to its corresponding mention. We rather consider the popularity features and standard textual similarity measures (BM25), presented in Sect. 5.1. Moreover, for comparison sake, we also report in Table 3 the performance of a baseline combination of the features using an Extra-Trees classifier [18] , compared with our Joint Multimodal Entity Linking approach (JMEL), which combines the textual and visual features at the representation level. Table 2 summarizes the features and the combination models used in these experiments. In order to more thoroughly assess the contribution of textual and visual information in the MEL task, we compare the performance of the proposed model when the visual features are combined with sentence embeddings that are derived from different models the following notable models: Skip-Thought [31] (D = 4,800) trained on a large corpus of novels, Sent2Vec [37] unigram and bigram vectors (D = 700) trained respectively on English Wikipedia and on a Twitter corpus, InferSent [8] (D = 2,048) Bi-LSTM+max pooling model trained on the Standford SNLI corpus, BERT [12] trained on BooksCorpus [49] and on English Wikipedia and ELMo [40] trained on the One Billion Word Benchmark [5] . For BERT and ELMo, sentences are represented by the average word embedding. Table 3 reports the accuracy results on the validation and test sets for the binary classification task about the correctness of the first entity selected from the KB for a given mention. First, we note that the baseline points out an imbalance in our dataset, as 59% of the mentions in the test set correspond to the most popular entity among the candidate entities, compared to 36.9% in the validation set. Note that for some Entity linking datasets, popularity can achieve up to 82% accuracy score [11] . We also observe that our popularity baseline outperforms the combination of textual and visual features with the Extra-Trees classifier: this indicates that the features extracted from the textual and visual contexts, when naively used and combined, produce poor results. In contrast, our model achieves significant improvements on both the validation and test sets compared with the popularity baseline and the Extra-Trees combination. We see that combining additional features in the JMEL model (popularity and BM25) also provides significant performance gain. Regarding the visual modality, although considering it alone leads to poor results, its integration in a global model always improve the performance, compared to text-only features.",

It shows that the integration of visual features always improves the performance of our approach, whatever the sentence embedding model we use, even though the level of improvement varies depending on the sentence Error Analysis. We identified several potential sources of errors that may be addressed in future work. First, in our approach we characterize entity contexts with a collection of text/image pairs and by taking their mean, we consider all these pairs equally important to represent an entity. However, by manually checking some entities, we note that each timeline may contain a subset of outlier pairs and more specifically, images that are not representative of an entity. Sampling strategies may be employed to select the most relevant images and to discard the misleading outliers. Moreover, our model fails on some difficult cases where the visual and textual contexts of entity candidates are indistinguishable. For example, it fails on the mention \"post \", by linking it to the entity @nationalpost instead of @nypost, two entities representing news organizations whose posts cover various topics. One additional bias is that we restricted our dataset and KB to have only tweets with images. Meanwhile, we observed that tweets without images tend to have more textual context. Thus, it would be interesting to include tweets without images for further experiments.",

We propose a model that first extracts textual and visual contexts for both mentions and entities and learns a joint representation combining textual and visual features. This representation is used to compute a multimodal context similarity between a mention and an entity. Preliminary experiments on a dedicated dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model and revealed the importance of leveraging visual contexts in the EL task. Furthermore, our work is all the more relevant with the emergence of social media, which offer abundant textual and visual information. In that perspective, we propose a new multimodal EL dataset based on Twitter posts and a process for collecting and constructing a fully annotated multimodal EL dataset, where entities are defined in a Twitter KB. Further exploration is still needed concerning certain points in our model: in particular, our future work includes exploring attention mechanisms for text and images and experimenting different sampling strategies for the triplet loss.",

For example, while the results of averaging BERT word embeddings and InferSent are comparable using images on the test set, InferSent performs significantly better than BERT using text only. This emphasizes the role of the visual context representation of mentions and entities to help in the EL task. If we look at the performance of the various sentence embeddings models, we can see that the sent2vec model trained on a Twitter corpus outperforms all other embeddings: this reveals the importance of training data in a transfer learning setting. Indeed, we observe that the sent2vec model trained on English Wikipedia produces worse results than the model trained on the target task data (Twitter). Hence, we can assume that other models that achieve good results when trained on a general corpus (such as InferSent or BERT) would get better results if trained on a Twitter collection.",
