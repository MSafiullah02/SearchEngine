Amory et al [10] described normal values of echocardiographic dimensions and functional indexes, as well as quantitative reference values for Doppler flow in healthy donkeys. Again, those references must be taken with caution because marked variations can be seen depending on the breed, body size, age, growth rate, and training of the animal. In some studies, body size appears to be the key factor affecting the chamber dimension, with donkeys showing smaller chambers compared with horses but similar dimensions compared with ponies. When echocardiographic parameters are adjusted to body weight, donkeys display a lower left ventricular mass index, bigger left ventricular internal diameter index, and relative wall thickness compared with horses. Tricuspid and mitral peak flow velocities are also reported as lower in donkeys than horses. While some of these differences could be attributed to training disparities (left ventricular mass index), the rest of them are likely idiosyncratic to donkeys. This issue should be taken into account during the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac patients. Finally, clinicians should know that standardized imaging techniques for guided M-mode and Doppler measurements previously described for horses can also be applied to donkeys.",

For example, anatomically, nasolacrimal conduct nasal opening is located dorsolateral in donkeys, whereas it is in the lateral wall of the external nares in mules [24]. Nasal cavity is strikingly narrower in donkeys compared with horses. Clinicians should be aware of this particularity, which predisposes donkeys to epistaxis during nasogastric tubing or endoscopy. Moreover, guttural pouch opening is slightly more horizontally oriented (important during the endoscopic maneuver to gain access into the pouch), pharynx is narrower (predisposing to collapse during endoscopy), and epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds are commonly smaller in donkeys than horses [25], [26], [27]. The carotid arterial tree is also anatomically different between both species [28], which could be related with the low described incidence of guttural pouch mycosis in donkeys [29]. The specific anatomy of those arteries in donkeys should be carefully studied before arterial coil embolization. Other respiratory clinical differences between both species are caused by their dissimilar behavior and attitude, for example, their insensitive cough reflex compared with horses [27]. Because donkeys are markedly stoic and rarely intensely trained, clinical signs are noticed later, and early diagnosis due to poor performance is rare in donkeys. Considering all these factors, most donkeys with respiratory disturbances are attended with more chronic and severe diseases states than horses, which undoubtedly should be considered when a prognosis is provided in this species.",

This fact could potentially make the donkey an interesting experimental model for this human disease. Asinine herpesvirus 4 (AHV-4) and AHV-5 have been isolated and proposed as potential causative agents for this condition [33]. One can speculate that this condition is equivalent to equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis\u2014linked to equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5)\u2014in horses. Pulmonary fibrosis can be confused with severe donkey asthma because resting respiratory effort, tachypnea, and cough are features of both conditions. Absence of pulmonary sounds is frequent with pulmonary fibrosis (although pulmonary sounds can be challenging to hear in fat donkeys). The diagnosis is based on thoracic radiography, which usually shows a diffuse interstitial pattern. The value of BAL in the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis is unclear. Intracellular inclusion bodies identified in respiratory epithelial cells of horses with pulmonary fibrosis have not been demonstrated in donkeys. Thoracic ultrasonography is not diagnostic but can confirm the presence pulmonary parenchymal disease. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are helpful in people but not feasible for donkeys. Pulmonary function tests and lung biopsy are useful ancillary diagnostic tools. Treatment for pulmonary fibrosis is similar to pulmonary interstitial diseases in horses and includes steroids, antifibrotic drugs (i.e., pentoxifylline), and bronchodilators. The pharmacology and efficacy of antiviral drugs such as acyclovir or valacyclovir have not been evaluated in donkeys.",

It is thought that a higher inspiratory effort and subsequent higher intrathoracic pressure could promote pulmonary fibrosis or viceversa, even in donkeys with moderate-severe asthma [27]. Clinical presentation depends on the collapse degree, from no signs to audible inspiratory and expiratory effort, tachypnea, chronic coughing, inspiratory honking noises, or even acute respiratory distress in severe forms.

High prevalence (68%\u201387.5% for donkeys and 29% for mules) has been reported worldwide [61], [62]. Therefore, horses and donkeys grazing together should be avoided, and pastures where donkeys have been grazing should be considered infested unless a strict routine deworming program has been implemented in those animals. Diagnosis is achieved via fecal examination (Baermann method). Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology may help, showing eosinophilic inflammation (keeping in mind differences in leukocyte percentages compared with horses) and rarer larval stages. Macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin and moxidectin) and benzimidazoles (fenbendazole, oxfendazole, and albendazole) are effective against this parasite. A pour on eprinomectin treatment has also be seen to be efficient in a couple studies [27], [63]. Rhinoestrosis has been described in African and European donkeys [64]. This upper respiratory tract myiasis can cause respiratory (even neurological if larvae migrate to the brain) signs such as dyspnea, wheezing, snorting, respiratory stridor, face rubbing, or sinusitis. Parasitic charge determines the clinical presentation. Lower tract disease is rarely seen with these parasites. Diagnosis is commonly reached via endoscopy.",

Intravertebral and intervertebral ratios and measurements (useful for the diagnosis of this disease) are undescribed in this species as well. Normal cranial CT or MRI image descriptions are also lacking, and only one case report has described CT and MRI findings in a donkey with severe brain trauma [65]. On the other hand, although only for miniature donkeys [66], reference values for cerebrospinal fluid parameters have been established. Total (2\u20134 cells/\u03bcL) and differential cell count, specific gravity, glucose, urea, total protein, total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, chloride, sodium, and potassium concentrations were measured. No gender differences were found, and only phosphorus was different between donkeys and horses (4 vs. 2.4 mg/dL, respectively).

Other studies have also detected EHV-1-like viruses in healthy donkeys, raising questions about their pathogenicity in this species [81]. A neurological condition similar to EHV-1 myeloencephalitis can be seen in donkeys [82], but its prevalence is lower than horses (even when affecting unvaccinated animals).",

For example, renal congestion, interstitial nephritis, and gastric glandular ulcers were seen in a group of miniature donkeys treated with flunixin meglumine (1 mg/kg/IV/PO), ketoprofen (2.2 mg/kg/IV), and phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg/IV or PO) twice daily during 12 days. Animals treated with phenylbutazone also showed anorexia and mild diarrhea [114]. High doses of gentamicin can also induce acute kidney disease in donkeys, with elevation in the levels of interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, and gamma interferon, as well as acute phase proteins. Interestingly, when this treatment was accompanied with vitamin C, inflammatory and acute disease markers significantly decreased [115]. In a similar way, other antioxidant products, such as selenium, have been proven to reduce azotemia in a donkey model with acute kidney disease induced by exercise [116].",

Incidence is usually high, and in some developing countries, such as Ethiopia, 86.4% donkeys present some ophthalmological condition [118] although this percentage should be understood to be true only for working animals in that location. Most frequent ocular pathology in donkeys are corneal ulcers. Their bigger conjunctival sac -compared with horses- and the mentioned populous periocular hair provide an ideal environment for foreign bodies. Their corneal surface is slightly larger and more convex than horses, which also predisposes them to corneal ulcer. Due to their behavior, the typical florid signs shown in horses (blepharospasm, epiphora, photophobia, and so forth) are later seen in donkeys. Corneal ulcer's treatment is similar to that described in horses, relying on a medical approach and surgery in severe cases. Several surgical techniques have been reported in donkeys for corneal ulcers resolution, such as the use of a porcine urinary bladder extracellular matrix graft in a miniature donkey with severe unilateral keratomalacia [119]. When medically treating donkeys with corneal ulcers and, if atropine is administered, gut motility, fecal production, and heart rate should be closely monitored [120].",

Three milliliters of iohexol did not change tear production [123] and neither altered tear composition [124], contrary to oil-based mediums such as amidotrizoate.

This population showed a strikingly high prevalence (90% in one study), mainly in the hindlimbs, which could be in part attributed to unique anatomical features, type of physical activity, and age [143], [144]. In general, musculoskeletal diseases in donkeys are similar to those described in horses, but some anatomical idiosyncrasies must be considered. Foot lesions appear to be the main cause of lameness (65% of the cases), and this structure is the one where differences between both species are more marked [145]. The dorsal hoof wall is more vertical in donkeys than horses (5\u00b0\u201310\u00b0), and their hoof-pastern axis is more upright [146]. The frog does not typically extend as far toward the toe as in horses (important when we apply a soft support in this area in cases of laminitis). In addition, the sole is more rounded in donkeys, with a U-shape (again important for corrective shoeing in laminitis and soft-tissue problems such as desmitis or tendinitis). For a more detailed description of donkeys' hoof idiosyncrasies, readers should consult the referenced bibliography [147]. The aforementioned anatomical differences are linked to radiographical specific findings in donkeys. For example, a negative phalangeal rotation angle can be seen in healthy donkeys [148]. The distance between the proximal limit of the hoof wall and the extensor process (founder distance) is greater in average-sized donkeys than that in horses (10\u201313 mm vs. 3\u20135 mm, respectively) [149], [150]. Finally, the mean integument depth is 25% greater in donkeys than horses (16.2 mm vs. 11\u201313 mm, respectively) [149]. Knowledge of these hoof measurements can aid the clinician during the diagnosis and monitoring of hoof disturbances in donkeys.",

In chronic cases, rotation of the third phalanx, sinking, bone remodeling, and demineralization, as well as typical growth rings can be found. Most laminitis in donkeys are endocrine in their origin (metabolic syndrome and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction). Therefore, along with X-ray images, endocrine tests should be performed in any donkey with laminitis. Treatment, for both acute and chronic cases, is similar to horses: soft support for the frog (bedding, soft pack, and soft shoes), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rest, and farrier.

A spinal origin of the lameness has been described in donkeys as well. Cervical and thoracolumbar reduced flexibility and pain has been linked to lameness of spinal origin [145]. Overwork and overloading in working animals or intervertebral disc protrusions could be the cause for this back pain [156].",
