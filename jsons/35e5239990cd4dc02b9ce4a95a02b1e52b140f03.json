The Guardian describes Moria camp in Lesbos as overcrowded with 20,000 people in a space built for 3000, while struggling to access water. 1 In refugee camps, volunteers, UN agencies and NGOs generally manage the healthcare services (Carballo et al. 2017) . The global COVID-19 response here is not only troubling, but unfortunately negligible with refugee populations across the world. The first case of COVID-19 has also been confirmed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh near the refugee camps that are already facing infectious outbreaks due its dense population, poor sanitation and lack of water, putting extreme pressure on insufficient health resources. The camps are home to the Rohingya who fled violent persecution in Myanmar. Fear among the refugees in regards to COVID-19 is currently spreading due to misinformation; or as one person stated 'If anyone gets infected, the authority has to kill her/him. Because if (s)he stays alive, the virus will transfer to another person's body.' (ACAPS 2020, p. 4) . A COVID-19 outbreak would, as observed, put additional pressures on the strained healthcare services and the already-conflict traumatised population. Bangladeshi healthcare workers have expressed concerns over the lacking test kits and challenges of social (physical) distancing.",

In India, the media reported the first case of COVID-19 in a slum with 23,000 people in less than a square kilometre in Mumbai. The infected woman lives with six others in a 250 square feet room. Contact tracing of people sharing the public bathroom with the infected woman has become impossible. 2 Imaginably, WHO's COVID-19 guidelines of two metres physical distancing and 20 s of hand washing with soap will not be enough (Kluge et al. 2020) . The lockdown in India without any notice has left millions of daily wage labourers stranded on their way home or stuck in slums without an income while worrying about how to put food on the table. People trapped en route home are currently gathering streets and squares in large crowds awaiting government supplied meals. 'I will die of hunger long before the virus gets me' has been the standard response to any media coverage. 3 Based on our experience in disaster preparedness among vulnerable populations, we suggest to:",
