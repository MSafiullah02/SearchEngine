The DNR decision needs to be made by three physicians who are in good standing with the Jordanian Medical Council, and are all in agreement that Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) will have no benefit in restoring the patient\u2019s health or curing the cancer (5, 6) the patient and family must also be in agreement with the decision. Many, although not all, hospitals in Jordan have a DNR policy in place, although experience among clinical staff of implementing these is relatively low (5).",

At KHCC, a terminally ill cancer patient is defined as either a patient with a progressive metastatic cancer (either having exhausted all lines of oncological treatment or declined treatment) with an expected prognosis of less than 6 months or a patient with multiple-organ failure who is actively dying (7,8). Prior to referral to the palliative care team, the primary oncologist explores and documents the patient\u2019s preference regarding resuscitation. Following referral to palliative care, the team routinely discusses goals of care with the patient and their family, which includes the patient\u2019s wishes for resuscitation. In Jordan, health care decisions tend to be family centred, rather than patient centred. It is common for patients to elect their family to receive health updates and make decisions regarding their care. Not all patients follow this \u2018cultural norm\u2019 and as in every setting, our team must explore with every patient their preference for receiving information and decision making. These procedures have been developed to ensure that decision-making reflects cultural preferences and practices. (9)",

In light of this, a decision was made by the committee to allow unilateral medical decision-making regarding resuscitation for terminally ill cancer patients in the event of increasing demand on ventilators due to COVID-19 cases. The committee unanimously passed an amendment to the DNR policy to preserve ICU beds and ventilator support for patients with a good prognosis. The ethics committee agreed that any patient with metastatic disease and progressive cancer with a poor prognosis or patients with multi-organ failure with a poor prognosis would not be offered cardiorespiratory resuscitation. Poor prognosis was defined by the committee to be any patient with an estimated prognosis of less than 3 months, utilising the oncologist\u2019s clinical prediction of survival, either by a temporal question (\u2018how long does the patient have\u2019) or a surprise question (\u2018will you be surprised if this patient dies within 3 months?\u2019) (10). Additionally, the palliative care team utilizes the palliative prognostic index (PPI), a prognostic model to predict poor prognosis (11). All decisions and rationale not to resuscitate must be communicated clearly and timely with the patient if possible, and with the family (12). The patient and family must be reassured that compassionate care and symptom control will not be compromised.",

Protecting staff during resuscitation attempts would require full personal protective equipment, including an FFP3 mask and facial protection, which would take between 3 and 5 minutes to apply, by which time the window to provide resuscitation may have been lost (13).
