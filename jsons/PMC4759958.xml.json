Plasmodium vivax malaria has been long known as \u201cbenign tertian malaria\u201d as opposed to the \u201cmalignant tertian or sub-tertian malaria\u201d caused by P. falciparum [2]. However, in recent years an increasing number of studies, especially from the Indian subcontinent and South America, have highlighted the role of P. vivax as a cause of severe and even fatal malaria [3\u20137]. For this reason, Baird recommended, in his revision of the nomenclature of human malaria, to include vivax malaria as an \u201cacute pernicious\u201d entity in terms of clinical presentation and evolution [6].",

Of note, in several studies and case reports, severe thrombocytopaenia was described as the most prevalent severity sign of vivax malaria [11\u201315].

After few days, he developed high grade fever (40 \u00b0C) associated with chills, headache and one episode of vomiting. He was visited by a primary physician who prescribed him cefixime 400 mg/day and acetaminophen. After 4 days, due to the persistence of fever and the onset of productive cough and asthenia, cefixime was changed to levofloxacin (500 mg/day). However, the fever did not resolve, and therefore the patient was taken to the nearest emergency department (ED). At presentation, he was febrile (39.5 \u00b0C), tachycardic (121 beats per min) and hypotensive (90/50 mm Hg); there were no meningeal signs and the Glasgow Coma Score was normal (15). Oxygen saturation while breathing ambient air was 99 %, the respiratory examination and a chest radiograph were both normal. Laboratory investigations were as follows: haemoglobin, 15.9 g/dL; red blood cell count, 5.54 \u00d7 109/L; total white cell count, 6.3 \u00d7 109/L (with 85 % neutrophils, 11 % lymphocytes and 4 % monocytes); platelet count, 14 \u00d7 109/L. With the exception of d-dimer concentration (9376 ng/dL), the other coagulation parameters were within the normal range. Hyponatremia (127 mmol/L) was present as well as raised values of C reactive protein (126 mg/L), total bilirubin (3.3 mg/dL), and lactate dehydrogenase (371 U/L). Serum concentrations of glucose, liver enzymes, urea and creatinine were within normal ranges. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed no hepatosplenomegaly and a normal biliary tract. Legionella and pneumococcus urine antigens were negative. A thin blood film showed \u201cmalaria parasites\u201d that were not identified at the species level by the laboratory technician. Due to lack of anti-malarial drugs and the expertise for the diagnosis and therapy of malaria, the ED physician contacted the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan for assistance. Ten hours after presentation at the first ED, the patient was finally admitted to the intensive care unit of Luigi Sacco hospital with a provisional diagnosis of \u201csevere malaria\u201d, based on the results of the laboratory tests (severe thrombocytopaenia and raised bilirubin levels) and the presence of hypotension. On physical examination, when admitted to the ICU, the patient was conscious, fully oriented to time and place with high fever (40 \u00b0C) and had severe headache. The pulmonary, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were reportedly unremarkable. Neither signs of bleeding nor skin petechiae were detected. No previous history of malaria episodes was elicited and no underlying chronic diseases were present. The patient was treated with a loading dose of intravenous quinine (1200 mg). At treatment inception the platelet count was 5 \u00d7 109/L, without haemorrhagic manifestations. Examination of the peripheral blood smear by the haematologist did not reveal platelet clumping and a blood sample obtained with sodium citrate confirmed the finding of low platelet counts thus excluding a diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopaenia. In the absence of bleeding the haematologist judged as unnecessary the use of platelet transfusions. Thick and thin blood smear examinations were diagnostic for P. vivax infection with schizonts, gametocytes and ring forms being detected and a very low parasitaemia (0.1 %). Plasmodium vivax monoinfection was subsequently confirmed by DNA polymerase chain reaction performed on a stored blood sample obtained on admission. Blood and urine cultures were obtained but gave negative results. Serology for HIV, CMV, dengue virus, leptospirosis, syphilis, Brucella and typhoid fever were negative.",

The following morning an infectious diseases consultation was requested which suggested an interruption of intravenous quinine (after two doses administered). In consideration of the stable clinical condition and the diagnosis of P. vivax malaria the patient was transferred to the Infectious Diseases ward where oral chloroquine was started to complete the treatment. Parasite clearance was observed within 48 h after hospital admission as well as improvement or complete disappearance of all accompanying signs and symptoms (fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, myalgia). After completing a 3-day course of chloroquine treatment, and documentation of normal glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity levels, the patient was started on oral primaquine (15 mg of base in a 26.3 mg tablet per day for 14 days) and discharged the fifth day of hospitalization in good clinical conditions and with platelet counts within the normal range (223 \u00d7 109/L).",

In recent years, an increasing number of case reports and hospital-based studies, have questioned the notion of \u201cbenign tertian malaria\u201d by describing severe and even fatal malaria associated with P. vivax infection [3\u20138, 12\u201315].

The exact mechanisms underlying the decrease in platelet counts is still unknown, but various hypothesis have been advanced including immune-mediated phenomena, oxidative stress, alterations in splenic function and a direct interaction between the parasite and platelets [18\u201322]. Recently, Coelho and coworkers demonstrated that macrophage-driven phagocytosis of platelets may be an important contributory mechanism and that the mean platelet volume was greater in thrombocytopaenic patients with vivax malaria than in controls [23]. The latter finding is particularly interesting because the presence of large circulating platelets and may be viewed as compensatory mechanism in order to preserve primary haemostasis. Accordingly, bleeding is seldomly observed in the course of malaria even among patients with severe thrombocytopaenia. So what is the clinical and prognostic significance of severe thrombocytopaenia in patients with vivax malaria?",

In fifteen of these studies, a cut-off value of less than 50,000 platelets per \u03bcL was used to define severe thrombocytopaenia [13, 52\u201360, 62\u201366]. Overall, platelet counts below 50,000/\u03bcL were present in 335 out of the 906 cases of severe malaria examined (36.9 %), although the prevalence varied significantly among the studies, from 12.5 % to 93 % (Table 2), because of the different selection criteria employed. Bleeding manifestations (mainly epistaxis) were observed in 108 patients (34.8 %), but only in two patients were they serious enough to directly contribute to death (i.e., disseminated intravascular coagulation and gastrointestinal tract haemorrhage) [54, 58].",

Leal-Santos and coworkers in a cross-sectional study conducted in 186 patients from the Mato Grosso region showed that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width (PDW) were significantly associated with the presence of warning signs of severe and complicated malaria (i.e., anaemia, hypotension and elevated creatinine levels) with odds ratios (OR) of 3.47 and 5.44, respectively [68]. In keeping with the above mentioned results, a large study conducted in Papua New Guinea showed that the greatest risk of severe thrombocytopaenia was associated with P. falciparum malaria (OR 6.03 vs 3.73 for P. vivax). However, the mortality risk for patients with severe thrombocytopaenia was higher among patients without malaria (7.9 %) than among those with P. falciparum (2.1 %) or P. vivax (1.5 %) malaria [69]. The authors also found a 16-fold higher risk of death when severe thrombocytopaenia was associated with severe anaemia (haemoglobin concentration below 5 mg/dL), and concluded that severe thrombocytopaenia should serve as a warning sign of poor outcome in patients with malaria particularly when it is accompanied by severe anaemia. Based on their findings, Lampah and coworkers proposed a threshold of \u226420,000 platelets/\u03bcL as a defining severity criterion for both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria [69].",

Of note, the CFR of P. vivax malaria was 16-fold lower than the one observed for P. falciparum malaria in the same period (0.032 %, 12/36.854) [5]. In another study conducted in Papua, Indonesia, between January 2004 and September 2009, a post hoc clinical death audit of cases of pure P. vivax malaria resulted in a CFR of 0.12 per 1000 infections [71]. Of note, of the six fatal cases for whom vivax malaria was considered the primary cause of death, four were young children of less than 2 years of age (two of whom were malnourished), and the other two were adults in whom sepsis was concomitantly documented.",

In endemic areas, the risk of death is low and influenced by several factors, such as very young age, severe anaemia at presentation, malnutrition, pregnancy, coexisting comorbidities and concurrent infections [69\u201371, 75]. When imported P. vivax malaria is considered, the risk of death is generally absent or negligible and principally influenced by old age. Another important issue that should be considered when comparing malaria mortality is the lack of high level supportive care in many countries where malaria is endemic a factor that explains the better outcome observed in non-endemic countries where high-quality healthcare is available [76]. Despite these considerations it should be emphasized that the risk of death directly attributable to P. vivax malaria should not be overlooked.",
