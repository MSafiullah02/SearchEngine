In total, ninety 7-d-old poults, which tested negative for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, and reovirus by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR , were divided evenly into 3 groups: A, B, and C. Birds in group A were inoculated orally with turkey astrovirus-positive intestinal contents from birds affected with PES. Group B received turkey astrovirus-containing intestinal contents from apparently healthy flocks. Group C served as a negative control and was given PBS. Clinical signs of diarrhea, depression, and dullness were observed in group A. Birds in group B also showed clinical signs similar to those in group A, although the signs were milder in nature. Birds in group C did not show any clinical signs. At 16 d postinoculation, the BW of birds in group A was significantly lower than that of birds in groups B or C. In addition, the bursa size was reduced in group A, but not in groups B or C. Birds in groups A and B, but not in group C, were found to shed turkey astrovirus in their feces, as detected by RT-PCR. These results provide a preliminary indication that TAstV-2 from PES birds may be more pathogenic than TAstV-2 from apparently healthy poults. Further studies are needed to determine if pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of TAstV-2 exist in the environment. These results also reinforce our previous observations that astrovirus is involved in PES, causing significant retardation in growth and weight gain.",

            "text": "Astroviruses are small, nonenveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome size of 6.8 to 7.9 kb. On the basis of their distinctive star-like structure, the name astrovirus was given to these small round viruses, which are known to cause diarrhea in humans and domestic poultry (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975) . The duck hepatitis virus, which was thought to be a picornavirus (Asplin, 1965) , was later renamed as an astrovirus on the basis of its morphology (Gough et al., 1984) . Turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was first detected in turkey poults experiencing diarrhea in the United Kingdom (McNulty et al., 1980) , and later in the United States (Reynolds and Saif, 1986) . Three types of avian astroviruses have been detected in turkeys, 2 of turkey origin and 1 of chicken origin Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a) . The turkey-origin viruses are known as turkey astrovirus 1 (TAstV-1) and turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) (Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002) , and the chicken-origin virus is called avi-an nephritis virus (ANV). The prevalence of TAstV-2, TAstV-1, and ANV in commercial turkey flocks approaches 100, 15.4, and 12.5%, respectively (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a) . The TAstV-2 has frequently been associated with poult enteritis complex (PEC), poult enteritis mortality syndrome, and poult enteritis syndrome (PES; Barnes et al., 2000; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a; Jindal et al., 2009a Jindal et al., , 2010a .",

Another 20 birds were selected from an apparently healthy flock (non-PES flock). The birds were killed by cervical dislocation and then necropsied. The intestinal contents from the 2 groups were each pooled separately and processed as described earlier (Jindal et al., 2009b) . Briefly, 10% suspensions of pooled intestinal contents in PBS were centrifuged at 1,200 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 25\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected and examined for bacteria (Salmonella) by culturing; they were found to be negative. We also tested the supernatants for rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus with reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (Jindal et al., 2009c) to ensure that they were only positive for TAstV-2. The position of the bands on the agarose gel at 598, 630, 849, and 1,120 bp was used to confirm the presence or absence of coronavirus, rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus, respectively. To further confirm viral identity, positive PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced at the Biomedical Genomic Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul). Sequencing was performed in both directions with the same primers as in the initial RT-PCR reactions. The sequences obtained were aligned with the existing database using the BLAST search tool available online (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).",

Saif, Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Wooster), TAstV-2, and turkey reovirus (SEP 108, kindly provided by J. M. Day, Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA). Prior to total RNA extraction, the intestinal contents were processed as described earlier in the source of inocula section. Extracted RNAs were subjected to RT-PCR for the detection of rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus using virus-specific primers (Jindal et al., 2009c) . The RT-PCR was performed using a Qiagen One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The position of the bands in the agarose gel at 630, 849, and 1,120 bp confirmed the presence of rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus, respectively ( Figure 1) . The virus-positive PCR products were purified and sequenced using forward and reverse primers (Jindal et al., 2009c) . The sequences were then aligned and subjected to BLAST analysis as described earlier.",

Though we did not calculate the feed intake in different groups, our daily subjective observation indicated a larger amount of unconsumed feed in the group inoculated with the PES material than that in the other 2 groups. Nighot et al. (2010) reported that TAstV-2 infection induces sodium malabsorption, possibly through redistribution of specific sodium transporters, which results in osmotic diarrhea. In our study, the 16% growth depression in group A birds inoculated with PES material is of considerable economic significance. Barnes et al. (2000) estimated that a 10 to 15% growth depression due to PEC would cause losses of $300 to $400 million annually to the US turkey industry. It is also possible that birds with enteritis are not able to achieve their target weight at marketing age (Odetallah et al., 2001; Jindal et al., 2009c) . In fact, a light turkey syndrome has been observed in Minnesota, where turkey weight is 4 to 5 pounds lower at marketing age in some farms.

The shedding pattern of TAstV-2 in sentinel birds in our study indicates that an infection induced by this virus may continue for a long period in a flock because of the availability of a sufficiently susceptible population. Though the spread can occur in both types of flocks, it seems that in apparently healthy flocks, this virus may assume a pathogenic role if birds are stressed. The presence of concurrent infections may further complicate the situation. We tested the fecal samples for rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus and found them to be negative for these 3 viruses. The inocula and samples were also found negative for Salmonella. Though our samples and inocula were negative for the aforesaid pathogens, the effect of other enteric pathogens in the inocula or poults in causing or increasing the severity of enteritis in experimental poults cannot be ruled out. Although the volume of inocula in both groups was the same, we cannot be certain that the amount of virus present in these inocula was the same. Different virus concentrations may also play a role in the prevalence and severity of enteritis.",

Increased severity of the disease and higher loss of BW in poults inoculated with PES material compared with those in poults inoculated with non-PES material indicate that there may be differences in the pathogenicity of TAstV-2. Additional studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. 1 pos: positive for turkey astrovirus-2; neg: negative for turkey astrovirus-2. 2 A = poults inoculated with turkey astrovirus-2-positive material from a flock with poult enteritis syndrome, B = poults inoculated with turkey astrovirus-2-positive material from an apparently healthy flock, and C = poults inoculated with PBS (control).",
