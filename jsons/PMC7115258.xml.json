First, in this densely populated area, high rates of antibiotic usage and selection pressure11 contribute to rapid development of resistant microbial strains. Furthermore, the public sector\u2019s dominance29, 30 in primary health care reduces continuity of physician care in general. Doctor shopping31 is common, and the patient\u2019s bargaining power for self-perceived treatment needs is high. Physicians may feel pressured by the patient\u2019s expectation of an antibiotic prescription even in the absence of clinical indications,32 although that could be an overestimation of the patients\u2019 expectations.33 However, in a competitive, mixed medical ecology, physicians may be driven to respond to patient\u2019s wishes and to be overly cautious to avoid potential medico-legal consequences in an atmosphere of protective medicine.34 The challenge and the need for appropriate physician stewardship has been recognized.35 On the other hand, several participants reported lack of clear instructions from their physicians as the reason why they did not complete the course of antibiotics. Limited consultation time is often a constraint for physicians in practice,36 hindering clear explanations for each prescription.

There was a linear dose-response relation between antibiotics knowledge and nonadherence, which did not vary with educational level. The differential impact of antibiotics knowledge and background education level on nonadherence suggests that traditional school education have failed to adequately equip the community to demonstrate proper behavior in antibiotics usage. Antibiotic overuse and misuse (and possibly that of nonadherence, which should be confirmed in further studies) are important contributors to the development of bacterial resistance.13, 16, 17 Targeted and multilevel community education in the appropriate use of antibiotics could be a valuable public health intervention in our combat against the ever-increasing threat of antibiotics resistance. To generate a real impact, it is equally critical that physicians should take the initiative to actively educate their individual patients about the importance of adherence to prescribed antibiotic therapy. Clearly defined, culturally relevant educational interventions targeted at both clinicians and the community can result in significantly improved knowledge regarding antibiotics resistance and indications,37 and a holistic, multilevel ecologic approach targeting the whole community should be emphasized.13\n",

However, the related lower threshold of antibiotics prescription in anticipation of potentially severe infections and infection control practices may produce an undesirable counteracting effect.42 The recent experience from European countries such as Norway43 has shown that antibiotic resistance can be halted, and potentially reversed, with comprehensive, appropriate legislative measures restricting antibiotics use, which are appropriately implemented and enforced. The need for active surveillance systems of antibiotics use and enforced legislative measures in metropolitans such as Hong Kong needs to be critically reviewed.",

            "text": "There are several limitations in this study. First, we did not include people, albeit a minority, who did not recognize the term \u201cantibiotics.\u201d Some of these could have been prescribed antibiotics, but their behavior was not assessed. This should lead to a more conservative estimate of effect size observed. Second, we cannot exclude misclassification error at the initial recruitment based on their prior knowledge of the term \u201cantibiotics.\u201d To reduce this potential misclassification, we also included prior experience of physician-prescribed antibiotics as another inclusion criterion. There may be recall error regarding previous antibiotic prescriptions, but any such effect is likely to equally distribute in the sample. Furthermore, if there is a bias because of prompting, it is likely to affect predominantly subjects with poorer knowledge in antibiotics, which would be expected to drive the results towards null, as opposed to the observed results in this study. Third, because the study was conducted in a rather challenging setting (nearby the zebra cross), we had to strike a balance between the depth of inquiry and the need to minimize the interview duration for each subject, so as to ease administration and enhance the response rate. For this reason, we could not inquire further into other important areas including knowledge of treatment failure as an important possible outcome of nonadherence and the (in)appropriateness of using antibiotics for viral infections/ influenza. Finally, this study was conducted in a location with high antibiotic resistance and may not apply to developing countries or suburban areas. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study, and, thus, causality cannot be confirmed. Nevertheless, given the nature of parameters studied\u2014nonadherence and antibiotics knowledge\u2014reverse causality is unlikely. Future large prospective interventional studies would be of great interest.",
