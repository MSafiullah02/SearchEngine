Our systematic studies on the synthesis of 1,4,2-benzodithiazine-1,1-dioxides and their subsequent transformation into N-(azolyl or azinyl)-2-mercaptobenzenesulfonamides A (Fig. 1 ) have resulted in promising anticancer agents [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and potent inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase (MBSAs) [6] . We also found that cyclic sulfonamide derivatives of 2-amino-8-chloro-5,5-dioxo [1, 2, 4] triazolo [2,3-b] [1, 4, 2] benzodithiazine (B, Fig. 1) [7, 8] or of type C-D ( Fig. 1 ) possess interesting in-vitro anticancer properties [9] [10] [11] . In addition, various 1,3-benzoxazine derivatives have been found to show versatile bioactivities such as antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal [12] , anti-human coronavirus [13] , and anticancer activity [14] .",

The scaffold of this class of compounds consists of two moieties: 1,1-Dioxo-1,4,2-benzodithiazine and 1,3-benzoxazine. The objective of this drug-design approach was to merge these two moieties to enhance their activity against cancer cells. Our previous studies with this class of compounds showed that electronic character of the benzodithiazine ring system substituent at position-3 was an important factor influencing cytotoxicity [15] . However, in this previous publication we reported that the compounds were quinazolinone derivates. Based on X-ray crystal structure analysis of two representative compounds we now correct the structures to be benzoxazine derivatives. Herein, the effects of further structural modifications on antitumor activity were explored within two structural domains: The benzodithiazine ring (substituent R 2 ) and substituents of benzoxazine moiety (R 1 -phenyl). A correlation between the structures of these derivatives and the potency to inhibit the growth of cancer cells was investigated by using quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) methods.",

            "text": "Molecular models of the amines R 2 were constructed and minimized with the software PCModel (Serena Software, Bloomington, IN, USA, ver 8.50). The MMX force field of PCModel was used in the calculation of the following descriptors: the saturated surface area (SSA), the unsaturated surface area (USA), the polar surface area (PSA), the molecular volume (molvol) and the molar volume (Mvol) of each fragment. The structures were imported into the program CAChe (Fujitsu Biosystems Group, Beaverton, OR, USA, ver 7.5.0.85) and the following descriptors were calculated with the PM5 semi-empirical method at the PM5 minimum: Dipole moment (DM), HOMO and LUMO energies, molecular refractivity (MR), polarizability (P), heat of formation (HF), water assessable surface area (WASA) and ionization potential (IP). Further descriptors calculated by CAChe were: Molecular weight (MW), logP, and the kappa shape indexes, orders 1, 2 and 3 (KSI-1, KSI-2, KSI-3).",
