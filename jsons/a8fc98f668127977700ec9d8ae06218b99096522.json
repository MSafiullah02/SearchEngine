According to the latest statistics for the EU member states, 227 366 rabbits were used during 1999 (Commission of the European Communities 2003). Both domesticated rabbits and European wild rabbits may be used for experimental research, but there are several problems in keeping and breeding the European wild rabbit (Bell 1999) . Today the most common breeds used are the New Zealand White (NZW), the Dutch and the Half Lop (Batchelor 1999) . Most laboratories buy these breeds as health defined (previously called Specific Pathogen Free) from accredited breeders (Townsend 1969 , Eveleigh et al. 1984 .",

Over the past 10-15 years many laboratories have improved the housing for rabbits, both in cages and also by introducing floor pens and group housing. However, there are still some aspects to be addressed in rabbit housing especially in relation to the fact that they can be very aggressive when kept in groups.",

European wild rabbits in a fenced grass area in England used for behavioural ecology research (photograph by Lena Lidfors 1995) During the first half of the 20 th century many new rabbit breeds were developed, and today there are 76 recognized breeds of fancy fur and Rex rabbits (British Rabbit Council 1991) . The New Zealand White (NZW) was accepted as a breed in 1925 according to American Standards (Batchelor 1999) . This rabbit has been bred for fast growth for meat production and their white pelts which can be dyed any colour, but it has also become a very commonly used laboratory breed. The negative impact of this breeding emphasis is that laboratory New Zealand White rabbits relatively easily become obese, and food is often restricted in singly housed animals to prevent this. Other rabbit breeds more suitable for laboratory research have been developed more recently, taking into account the purpose of a certain research area, for example the Half Lop, which has long ears suitable for repeated blood samples during anti-body production.",

Sexual maturity occurs at the age of 5-7 months in males and 9-12 months in females, depending on climate (Myers et al. 1994) . Domestic rabbits are sexually mature at 4-6 months of age (Falkmer and Waller 1984) , but the small breeds are sexually mature earlier than the medium and large breeds (Bennet 2001) . Before mating the rabbits circle around each other, parade side by side, jump over each other and sniff around the genital region (Lehmann 1991) . Hafez (1960) found seven degrees of sex drive which ranged from aggressive with immediate mounting and ejaculation to offensive reaction with general smelling of the skin, biting and no ejaculation. The buck mating takes only seconds, after which he dismounts to the side or backwards (Bennett 2001) . When allowing mating the doe raises the hind quarters. The ovulation is induced by the mating and the sperm is waiting until the egg appears after 8-10 hours, when conception takes place (Bennett 2001) . The doe can mate immediately following parturition, and if the young are removed after delivery she will be sexually receptive for at least 36 days (Hagen 1974) .",

Some days before the birth the doe digs an underground nest either within the main warren or in a separate breeding \"stop\" dug specifically for the purpose (Bell 1999) . These are short, shallow burrows dug at a distance of 10-50 yards from the warren. High ranking females have been found to often give birth to their young in a special breeding chamber dug as an extension to the warren, whereas some of the subordinate females are chased away from a warren and forced to drop their litters in isolated breeding \"stops\" (Mykytowycz 1968 ). The survival rate is much higher for the high ranking than the low ranking females. The doe collects and carries grass to her burrow and shortly before giving birth she plucks her own fur from the belly, sides and dewlap, and places it on top of the grass (Gonz\u00e1les-Mariscal et al. 1994 , Bell 1999 . The better the construction of the nest the higher the survival rate of the young (Canali et al. 1991) .",

They each weigh around 50 g at birth and gain about 30 g per day (Falkmer and Waller 1984) . The size of the litter is 3-6 young for European wild rabbits, and 4-12 young for domesticated rabbits (Batchelor 1999) . At birth the young rabbits are very sensitive to cold, but as their fur grows out within a couple of days they become less sensitive (Batchelor 1999) . The eyes open at 10-11 days (Kersten et al. 1989 , Batchelor 1999 , or 9-12 days (Falkmer and Waller 1984) . Hearing develops at the same time, but no reference on this has been found. When the young are born the doe leaves the burrow and covers the entrance with soil, urine marks it, and then leaves (Mykytowycz 1968) . She returns to the burrow once a day, and then digs herself into the burrow and nurses her young (Bell 1999) . In a study on Dutch Belted rabbits the nursing took place in the early morning and lasted for 2.7-4.5 minutes (Zarrow et al. 1965) . When given the opportunity to retrieve their young, does did not perform this behaviour (Ross et al. 1959) . The doe closes the burrow and or breeding \"stop\" for about 21 days, after which the young emerges onto the surface (Bell 1999) . The young are very mobile at four weeks of age, and leave their breeding stop soon after emergence (Lloyd and McCowan 1968) . At that time they start seeking forage, but they continue to suckle for some more weeks. The does reach maximum milk production two weeks after giving birth, this declines during the fourth week and they may lactate for an additional 2-4 weeks. At 8 weeks of age the young are consuming approximately 90% of their intake in the form of plant proteins (Hagen 1974) . In commercial rabbit breeding the young are usually weaned and separated from the doe at 6-7 weeks of age (Hagen 1974 , Bennett 2001 .",

Studies of natural, free-ranging and enclosed populations in Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom have shown that European wild rabbits live in small, stable, territorial breeding groups (Parer 1977 , Gibb et al. 1978 , Cowan 1987 , Bell and Webb 1991 . The breeding group is generally described to defend its territory, a core area with a warren within a larger home range, by patrolling the borders and scent-marking (Bell 1999) . However, in some studies it has been found that breeding groups only occupy single warrens (Myers and Schneider 1964, Bell 1977) , whereas in other studies of free-living populations of rabbits most breeding groups used multiple warrens (Dunsmore 1974 , Parer 1977 , Wood 1980 , Daly 1981 , Cowan 1987 . During the peak feeding periods at dawn and dusk members of neighbouring breeding groups may move out from their territories to forage in communal grazing areas (Bell 1980) . The number of entrances per warren was found to be 11.5 \u00b1 8.0 SD, with a range of 1-37 (Cowan 1987) . The different breeding groups together make colonies of up to 70 rabbits. The social unit is the breeding group, which consists of 1-4 males and 1-9 females (Meredith 2000) .",

The strict rank order is maintained by rabbits keeping a fixed distance from one another and exhibiting submissive behaviour. Early studies of the European wild rabbit in Australia revealed that a substantial portion of the rabbits' daily activity was filled with direct or indirect aggression Rowley 1958, Mykytowycz and Fullager 1973) . It was concluded that this behaviour underlies the social and territorial organisation, which are the main factors affecting the numbers of free-living populations of this species (Mykytowycz 1960) . In some studies does have been found to be more aggressive than bucks (Southern 1948, Myers and Poole 1961) , or found to fight as strongly as males (Lockley 1961) . Females mainly fight over breeding burrows (Cowan and Garson 1985) , and are more aggressive towards juvenile females (91% of interactions) than juvenile males (Cowan 1987) . Males are tolerant to females, young and sub-adults in their breeding group, and have even been observed to interrupt aggressive interactions between females. When the number of rabbits living together increased, fighting increased dramatically (Myers 1966) . In nature young males normally move to a new social group before the start of their first breeding season, while young females stay on to breed in their breeding group (Parer 1982 , Webb et al. 1995 . Lehmann (1991) has described 20 different social behaviours of New Zealand White rabbits kept in a semi-natural enclosure, and how the social behaviours change with age. Indifferent contacts were body-to-body, noseto-body, nose-to-nose contacts and anogenital nuzzling. Amicable behaviour comprised cuddling up and allogrooming. Subdominant behaviour was crouching, retreating and fleeing, whereas aggressive behaviour was circling, nudging, attacking and chasing. Actual fights with aggressive leaping and ripping were observed only 7 times. Mykytowycz and Hesterman (1975) made paired encounters between male and female European wild rabbits and New Zealand White rabbits in a home pen, and found that aggression was equally prevalent in both sexes and inter-sexual fighting occurred just as frequently as fighting between members of the same sex. The domesticated NZW rabbits were fighting just as much as the wild rabbits, but paired domestic females and domestic males paired with wild rabbits of both sexes fought less frequently and less viciously than other paired rabbits.",

The territory of rabbits is scent marked by placing faeces in dunghills, and about 30 such dunghills have been located in a typical warren. The rabbit also marks its territory by pressing the under-chin against structures in its environment so that droplets from its sub-mandibular glands are forced through pores of the skin. Scent marking is more intensive by males than females and more in dominant than sub-dominant individuals, and it is correlated with larger anal and submandibular glands in dominant males (Mykytowycz 1968 ). The most dominant animals of a warren were found to possess the heaviest anal glands. Males scent mark females and young rabbits of their breeding group by spraying urine on them. Females scent mark their young, attack other young within the same breeding group, and may chase and even kill young from other breeding groups. Females may attack even their own young if they have been smeared with foreign urine (Mykytowycz 1968) .",

The old bucks emerge first, about four hours before sunset (Mykytowycz and Rowley 1958) , and by sunset 90% of the rabbits have emerged (Fraser 1992) . The rabbits are visible on the ground during 11-14 hours of the diurnal cycle (Mykytowycz and Rowley 1958) . When the rabbits are above ground they spend about 44% of their time eating, 33% inactive, 13% moving and 10% on other activities (Gibb 1993) . During semi-natural conditions young NZW rabbits were active for an average of 30% of the daytime. Feeding on pellets and grazing took a third each of the active time, and the remaining third was spent exploring, gnawing, intensive locomotion and, for the older rabbits, engaging in sexual behaviour (Lehmann 1989) . The rabbit's choice of habitat depends on the opportunities to find shelter and protection, and where the soil is loose it digs burrows, and where the soil is more compact it seeks protection in dense vegetation (Kolb 1994) . In case of danger a rabbit can stamp with its hind feet, thus causing the other rabbits to flee underground (Black and Vanderwolf 1969). If it is too late to flee the rabbit can freeze, i.e. stop in its movement and be completely motionless. A rabbit can, if caught by a predator, emit a high distress scream (Cowan and Bell 1986) , which may cause the predator to release its prey. Apart from this and some low sounds during mating and mother-young care rabbits are silent animals.",

Both wild rabbits and domestic strains have reproductive seasonality, suckle their young only once every 24 h, show two main feeding periods at dawn and dusk, form breeding groups with separate linear dominance hierarchies among male and female members, and reproduce successfully with the female digging breeding burrows, building nests for their young and covering the entrance to the burrows with soil (Bell 1984) . The difference found is that domestic rabbits rest more above ground during the day (Stodart and Myers 1964) and that males chin-mark more often (Kraft 1979) also in unfamiliar territory (Mykytowycz 1968 ). New Zealand White females had fewer days in anoestrus than wild rabbits, and therefore produced more litters with a larger mean size (Stodart and Myers 1964) . When European wild rabbits were brought into the laboratory they failed to breed, and females born into the laboratory as a result of egg transfer from wild to domestic mothers retained their nervous disposition and failed to mature sexually (Adams 1987 ).",

The most obvious abnormal behaviour is stereotypy, e.g. wire-gnawing, excessive wall-pawing (Lehmann and Wieser 1985 , Wieser 1986 , Bigler and Lehmann 1991 , Loeffler et al. 1991 , Stauffacher 1992 . When many rabbits gnaw on the wire of their cages there might be a high sound level in the animal room ( Figure 10 -2). Digging may be constrained by the solid floor of the cage (Podberscek et al. 1991) . The stereotypic behaviour substitutes for natural behaviours which cannot be performed in standard laboratory housing (Stauffacher 1992) and may indicate frustration, anxiety or boredom, and develop in stages involving a progressive narrowing of the behavioural repertoire (Gunn 1994) . Individually caged rabbits show stereotypies, such as somersaulting, no full hops, less activity than group-penned rabbits, and less marking and investigatory behaviour than in group pens (Podberscek et al. 1991) . Social isolation can induce the physiological symptoms of stress, which are relieved by the presence of conspecifics (Held et al. 1995) .",

Prolonged inactivity associated with unresponsiveness, may, like stereotypies, be associated with brain chemistry changes which make the problem seem less bad (Broom 1988 ). Gunn and Morton (1995) mention problems with under-grooming which may lead to a staring coat, and over-grooming which may lead to hair-balls which in turn may cause intestinal stasis (Jackson 1991 ) and lead to death by gastric trichobezoars (Wagner et al. 1974) . Under-eating, causing weight loss and over-eating causing obesity are other behavioural problems (Gunn and Morton 1995) . The very limited freedom of movement in caged rabbits leads to changes in locomotion which prevent hopping, thus causing changes in the locomotion apparatus (Lehmann 1989 , Stauffacher 1992 . It is mainly in the femur proximalis and the vertebral column that changes of the bone structure occur, and the changes consist of thinner and less strong hollow bones (Lehmann 1989, Drescher and Loeffler 1991a,b) . Lehmann (1989) showed that growing rabbits perform almost no hopping and intensive locomotion mainly during playing when kept in cages compared to an outdoor enclosure. Crawling, which was the most common movement pattern, was slightly less common in the cages. These rabbits often performed interrupted jumps, where the hindlegs only were lifted slightly and then put down again, thus not being used as in normal hopping. Abnormal postures may also be shown due to spatial restriction for lying stretched out during resting or performing stretching behaviour (Gunn 1994) .",

This will depend on the degree of stress the animals were under at arrival, which in turn may depend on the nature of the journey, its duration and which parameter is being assessed during the recovery period (Swallow 1999) . Olfert et al. (1993) state that newly acquired rabbits should be held in quarantine for at least three weeks, and examined regularly for disease. Animals dying during this period should be subjected to complete post-mortem examinations. Most laboratories we have contact with bring rabbits from suppliers of health defined rabbits bred behind a barrier. Often most of the rabbits come from the same supplier, thus there is no need for quarantine. However, when purchasing rabbits from different suppliers we recommend placing them in different animal rooms at least during an acclimatization period of up to three weeks.",

Batchelor (1999) found considerable differences in body weight in rabbits that were housed in group pens compared to solitary in cages after transportation. The loss of weight in rabbits after transport is mostly due to a loss of gastrointestinal contents in of about 10% of the total body weight (Swallow 1999) . These losses are probably maximal after about 15 h of transport, and similar to depriving animals of food and water during the same amount of time. However, the loss in live weight can take up to 7 days to recover (Swallow 1999) . Our own research on the effect of providing male rabbits with or without hay and with a change or no change in the feed after a 10 h transport by truck, plane and truck showed that providing hay had a significant effect of reducing the occurrence of diarrhoea (Lidfors pers. com.).",

The cages for laboratory rabbits have changed from traditional wooden hutches to galvanized iron, aluminium, stainless steel and now plastic caging (Morton et al., 1993) . Today three main types of cages can be found; wire, sheet metal with wire front and plastic with wire front (Stauffacher et al. 1994) . Housing in small barren cages can lead to several abnormal behaviours and reduced welfare of rabbits (see section on abnormal behaviours). The cages with solid sides, back and top tend to isolate the animals, and prevent them from seeing the source of disturbance. This may cause the rabbits to be jumpy, and in breeding units lead to higher losses due to cannibalism. In order to allow rabbits to see their surroundings it is recommended that barred \"windows\" occupy 30-50 % of the total wall area (Stauffacher et al. 1994) .",

The heights of the cages should be from 40 cm for rabbits <2 kg up to 60 cm for rabbits >5 kg in the Swiss Ordinance of Animal Protection 1991 (Stauffacher et al. 1994 ). In the suggestions for new rules in the Appendix A from the Council of Europe it is written that cages and pens for rabbits >10 weeks of age should be 3 500 cm\u00b2 (45 cm height) for <3 kg rabbit, 4 200 cm\u00b2 (45 cm height) for 3-5 kg rabbit and 5 400 cm\u00b2 (60 cm height) for >5 kg rabbit. The weights are for the final body weight that any rabbit will reach in the housing. The floor area is minimum floor area for one or two socially harmonious animals, and the height is a minimum height. It is also stated that a raised area, i.e. shelf, must be provided within the cage, and if not providing a shelf the cage size must be 33% larger for a single rabbit and 60% larger for two rabbits. The suggested new rules in Sweden have been agreed since 1995, but so far no decision has been taken by the Agricultural Board. During the last 10 years there has been a development of new cage systems (Figure 10-3) , using a cage with an increased floor area, a higher cage for upright sitting, a shelf for rabbits to hop up onto or hide under, racks to make hay feeding easier and flexible cage racks so that several cages can be built together. A raised shelf reduces restlessness, grooming, bargnawing, and timidity of being captured (Berthelsen and Hansen 1999) . Wild rabbits rear when they are looking at their surroundings (Lockley 1961) , and caged rabbits use boxes and shelves provided as sources of enrichment and lockout posts (Hansen and Berthelsen 2000) . Mirrors as a form of enrichment do not provide an image of a companion, but probably stimulate activity by enriching the visual environment and increasing the amount of movement perceived by the rabbit (Jones and Phillips submitted). If rabbits are housed in a cage with a living area and darkened resting area, putting mirrors in the living area increases the time rabbits spend there, and especially the time that they spend investigating their environment and feeding (Jones and Phillips submitted).

            "text": "Group housing of rabbits in floor pens has been introduced in many laboratories and countries during the last 10-15 years (Figure 10-4) . This is beneficial for the rabbits because they can express social behaviours and exercise Stott 1990, Batchelor 1991) . Abnormal behaviours and physiological conditions caused by small barren environments are also reduced, but there is an increased risk of fighting between rabbits (Morton et al. 1993) . The major factors that have to be considered when group housing rabbits are: compatibility of individual animals, size of pens, stocking density, husbandry practices and environmental enrichment (Morton et al. 1993) . Rabbits which are not compatible will fight when placed together in a group, and the greatest problems occur when placing adult males together (Morton et al. 1993 ). There are strain differences in aggressiveness, i.e. Dutch rabbits are more aggressive than New Zealand White, whereas Lops are more docile (Morton et al. 1993) . Some of the small strains of rabbits may show more aggression than the larger strains (Stauffacher et al. 1994) . Individual animals may be highly aggressive, and fights can occur for unknown reasons, even in groups that have been stable for a long time (Morton et al. 1993) . Therefore, groups of rabbits need to be carefully selected and regularly monitored. The best option is to keep litter mates which have been kept together from weaning (Zain 1988) . Groups of intact, mature females not intended for breeding can be kept together (Morton et al. 1993) . In periods of rest, does, bucks, and older young kept in mixed groups congregate and snuggle against each other or engage in mutual grooming (Stauffacher 1992) . Does have showed a weak preference for a large, enriched, solitary pen over a group pen, but a strong preference for a group pen over a smaller, barren, solitary pen (Held et al. 1995) . Fighting can still occur in groups of does, and a dominant female in oestrus can mount and damage the skin on the backs of other females and harass the group (Morton et al. 1993) . The degree of compatibility of grouped rabbits will depend on factors such as strain, individual characteristics, sex, age and weight, size and structuring of pens, methods of husbandry and the interest and ability of the animal technicians (Bell and Bray 1984 , Zain 1988 , Morton et al. 1993 , Stauffacher 1993 . Aggression may be seen in group pens even after the establishment of the dominance hierarchy.",

Groups of males kept in proximity of females tend to fight and urinate more frequently (Portsmouth 1987) . Castration of males kept for longer periods in the laboratory may be one solution to be able to keep them in groups. The practical experience from castration of males is that aggression is reduced and stable for a long time afterwards (Gunn pers. com. in Morton et al. 1993 , Lindberg pers. com. 2003 . Castration should be carried out when the males reach sexual maturity at 50-80 days of age depending on strain and food composition (Stauffacher et al. 1994) . It should be carried out only by well-trained persons and always before the males start to show aggressive behaviour, 3-4 weeks after weaning at the latest (Stauffacher et al. 1994 , Morton et al. 1993 . The testicles move down during sexual maturation, but then are withdrawn again. However, one has to consider what type of research the animals will be used for, as castration has an effect on the animal's physiology.",

When establishing new groups of rabbits in floor pens the best option is to wean and mix at the same time around 6 weeks of age and to place 6-10 rabbits, preferably of the same sex, in one group (Morton et al. 1993) . The ideal situation is when animals are kept in stable groups from birth (Zain 1988 , Stauffacher 1993 . Small groups may be most stable (Love and Hammond 1991) . Some animals do not appear to settle well in groups, either because they are too dominant and bully the others or are too timid and prone to be bullied (Morton et al. 1993) . When putting together rabbits that have been caged for six months or more it may be difficult to avoid fighting or self-inflicted injuries (Morton et al. 1993 ). However, individually-caged adult female rabbits of peaceful strains can be paired successfully, preferably in structured cages (Stauffacher 1993 , Morton pers. com. in Stauffacher et al. 1994 . It is very important to provide refuge and hiding places for subordinate animals (Morton et al. 1993 ). The number of rabbits kept in each group pen should not exceed 6-8 mature animals (Morton et al. 1993 , Stauffacher et al. 1994 . This is recommended so that the rabbits can be adequately monitored for signs of bullying and ill-health. Groups of up to 20 laboratory rabbits have been successfully managed as stock and for the production of polyclonal antibodies (Stauffacher et al. 1994 ). However, more research is needed on optimum and maximum group size (Stauffacher et al. 1994) .",

In the Swiss legislation each rabbit must be able to hop some steps or to jump up and down onto a shelf. This may help the rabbits to maintain a level of fitness and reduce the occurrence of disuse osteoporosis (Morton et al. 1993 ). The working group on \"Refinement in rabbit husbandry\" recommend that rabbits kept in groups have a clear area of 20 000 cm\u00b2 with an overall minimum floor area of 6 000 -8 000 cm\u00b2 per rabbit for groups up to 6 rabbits. If more than 6 rabbits are kept in the groups an extra space of 2 500 cm\u00b2 per rabbit is recommended (Morton et al. 1993) . The height of floor pens should be 1.25 m., as rabbits can jump very high, and enrichment objects should be placed so that they can not be used for jumping over walls.",

However, feeding laboratory rabbits in cages means that they are almost invariably not fed the diet of grass for which they evolved to utilize. However, there is little evidence that they prefer a grass diet to one based on compound feed (Leslie et al. 2004) .

The visual stimulus of a varied diet is particularly important (Ruckebusch et al. 1971) . A mixed diet is also a feature of natural herbivore feeding behaviour, due to their desire to sample regularly in case of the disappearance of one feed (Parsons et al 1994) .",

Local anaesthetic facilitates the removal of blood from those animals which are distressed by the insertion of the needle into the ear vein. The cardiac puncture must be carried out under anaesthesia with the animal in dorsal recumbency. Rabbits have about 70 ml of blood per kg body weight, and a maximum of 7 ml/kg body weight should be taken at a single sample (Batchelor 1999) . Others have suggested that up to 8 ml of blood could be taken per kg body weight at a single sample (Iwarsson et al. 1994) The body temperature of rabbits should be taken by a suitable thermometer which has been lubricated for ease of introduction into the anus (Batchelor 1999) . The rabbit should be gently restrained, the tail lifted and the thermometer gently inserted. The thermometer should never be forced into the anus, and if there are any obstructions to the passage it should be investigated. The thermometer should be left in situ for 1-2 minutes, whereafter the temperature is recorded. In rabbits the normal mean rectal temperature is 38.3\u00baC with a range of 37.0-39.4 \u00baC.",

If animals are returned to a group pen while they recover consciousness they may be subjected to aggression. Incision sites should be covered with a clear plastic dressing spray, but rabbits may occasionally interfere with their stitches.

At arrival to the laboratory the rabbits should be checked for any health problems and placed in its new cage. Acclimatization should be one to two weeks. Young rabbits could be housed pair-wise in cages, or in larger groups in floor pens. Cages should be large enough to give rabbits a place to perform hopping movements and to lie in a position fully stretched out. They should be provided with free access to hay and water, and fed at least once daily. Floor pens should be large enough to house the maximum number of rabbits planned for, at least one meter high to prevent escape and enriched with refuges, hay, gnawing sticks, etc. Regular cleaning of cages and floor pens are important to keep a good hygiene and healthy animals.",

Both improvements of cage systems and floor housing have been evaluated. There are several companies selling environmentally enriched cage systems and equipment for building floor pens and enrichment items for floor pens. Parallel with this development, new regulations have been planned and intensively discussed over the past years (Appendix A of the European Convention, regulations in Sweden), and some have been put into practice (regulations in Switzerland and UK). The most important welfare research to carry out for the future would be to verify if some of the behaviours rabbits perform in semi-natural environments, for example digging, is so important that it could be considered an essential behavioural need. Alternatives to permanent cage housing of mature bucks, as for example regular exercise in an enriched area, should also be scientifically evaluated.
