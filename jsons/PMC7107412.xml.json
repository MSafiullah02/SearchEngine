The hMPV antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified virion as the antigen, a method described by Okamoto et al [18]. In brief, 96 microwell plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were coated with a Sendai-155-D06 (hMPV-A) and Sendai-1311-04 (hMPV-B) antigen mixture and refrigerated at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours. Plates were then blocked for 1 hour at room temperature and washed. Starting at a 1:100 dilution, 50-\u03bcL serial 2-fold dilutions of samples were added to the prepared plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Plates were labeled with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and detected using a peroxidase substrate kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 415 nm. Patients with a \u22654-fold increase of antibody titers between the acute and convalescent phase were regarded as having an acute hMPV infection [19].",

Falsey et al [20] reported that older adults more frequently experience dyspnea and wheezing, during the course of the disease, compared with younger patients. Although no fatal cases were recorded in this cohort, the mortality rate of elderly patients in LTCF during an hMPV outbreak has been reported to be approximately 10% [3, 5], demonstrating again that elderly patients are susceptible to more severe hMPV infections. Darniot et al [21] also demonstrated that older mice develop a more severe hMPV infection compared with young mice. Nevertheless, outbreaks of hMPV also occurred in LTCF for intellectually disabled patients (facilities A and C), where residents were not elderly. In general, the immune system of intellectually disabled patients is not weak; however, we speculate they may have been susceptible to hMPV due to isolation and lack of exposure to natural infection of hMPV for an extended time. Therefore, it is possible their antibodies against hMPV might be unusually diminished.",

Although Scheuerman et al [22] reported that AST and ALT were slightly elevated in hMPV-infected immunocompromised children, no studies have revealed the novel characteristics of serum markers in adult patients with hMPV pneumonia. Some viral and bacterial pathogens can cause rhabdomyolysis. Influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and coxsackie virus are the most commonly documented [23], whereas Legionella species, Francisella tularensis, and S. pneumoniae [23, 24] are common among bacterial pathogens. Respiratory pathogens, such as Chlamydophila psittaci and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been implicated [25]. However, neither rhabdomyolysis nor elevated levels of CPK have been reported in patients with hMPV pneumonia before. More importantly, these data indicate that hMPV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis when we treat pneumonia patients with elevated CPK.",

Proximal tramlines arising out from the hilum seem like \u201cspider legs\u201d on the chest x-ray. Although some studies report the radiological findings of hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, studies conducted within immunocompetent adults or the elderly are limited. Previous studies have shown interstitial infiltrates, GGO, as well as centrilobular nodules suggestive of bronchitis and bronchiolitis are common radiological features for hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [26\u201329]. However, only 1 report describes chest images among elderly, immunocompetant inpatients during an hMPV outbreak. Four of the 8 affected patients had abnormal shadows in the chest x-ray, and 3 of the 4 had linear shadows and were diagnosed with hMPV-induced bronchitis or bronchiolitis [17]. Because ciliated airway epithelial cells are the primary targets for hMPV infection [30], it is easily justifiable for bronchial wall thickenings, evidence of bronchitis or bronchiolitis, to be common radiological features in hMPV pneumonia. Centrilobular nodules, interstitial infiltrates, and GGO were not frequently observed in the present study. It is possible that an immunocompromised host\u2019s weaker immune response to hMPV may allow the virus to spread into the peripheral bronchiole and lung parenchyma. However, this cohort did not contain immunocompromised individuals, and radiological findings may reflect a more reasonable host response to hMPV infections.",

In addition, this study may contain other limitations beyond those expected of a retrospective study. First, hMPV RAT and/or PCR were not performed in all symptomatic patients during the outbreaks. Due to the restrictions of the national health insurance system in Japan, RAT and PCR testing for hMPV is not approved for diagnostic decisions in adult patients. As such, attending physicians in each LTCF consulted the University of the Ryukyus\u2019 Department of Infectious Diseases, Respiratory, and Digestive Medicine as each outbreak waned. As a result, only a subset of affected patients could be tested. Other laboratory testing, bacterial cultures, and imaging tests (eg, chest x-ray and CT) were also only performed on subsets of patients. Moreover, by including fever in the case definition, it is possible that the mildest forms of hMPV infection were overlooked. Elderly patients do not always exhibit fever during infection. However, using respiratory symptoms alone may have broadened the case definition beyond usefulness. Our cohort contained multiple, and in many cases severe, underlying disorders. Therefore, patients were frequently unable to self-report andphysicians had to rely solely on observation. Thus, bias should be considered when interpreting these data.",
