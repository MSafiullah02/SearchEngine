Southeast Asia is a loosely defined geopolitical region that is characterised and shaped by differing environmental, ecological, and economic factors. These factors are discussed in more detail in other reports in this Series. As a consequence, the region shoulders a great diversity of communicable disease and, closely associated with development, a heavy burden in countries with the lowest incomes (see figure\n).1 The region has been at the centre of global attention regarding emerging infectious diseases, with the threat of diseases with pandemic potential receiving particular attention. Although the focus of this paper is emerging infectious diseases, as can be seen in the figure, the burden of infectious diseases is substantial. In low-income countries in particular, respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases are especially important. For the purposes of this paper, we define southeast Asia as the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a region with growing geopolitical influence in view of Asia's global economic ascendancy. The ASEAN countries are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.",

The region also is politically complex, with some intranational and international tensions that have the potential to further hinder control.\u2022There has been substantial investment in surveillance capacity in recent years, but it remains weak in many areas.\u2022Research in the region that practically informs policy and practice is scarce. Research areas demanding attention include the development of predictive surveillance (including the potential risks associated with social and environmental changes) and priority setting within health systems to allow response to surges in demand and to improve equity, effectiveness, and efficiency.\n\n",

            "text": "During the past decade, novel viruses, particularly those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A H5N1, have attracted international concern, attention, and investment in southeast Asia. These two diseases, although undoubtedly exerting major public health and economic burdens, represent only part of a rich tapestry of many pathogens that have emerged to pose a public health threat within the region in recent years (table and panel 1\n).5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Recent outbreaks of Nipah virus and artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, for example, both of which have emerged within the region itself, have also focused national, regional, and international attention on the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases, and in particular on southeast Asia as the epicentre of these diseases.Panel 1A brief overview of selected newly emerging infectious diseases in southeast Asia\nNipah virus\nIn recent decades, the only major infectious disease in man to have probably emerged in southeast Asia was severe febrile encephalitis during infection with Nipah virus. Occurring in peninsular Malaysia and Singapore in late 1998 to early 1999, the outbreak resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people in these two countries (at a case fatality rate of around 40%),8 which is twice as many as were killed by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) across all of southeast Asia and just under half as many as have died of avian influenza A H5N1. Most of those infected worked in the pig farming and meat production industries, reflecting the major form of transmission, which was close contact between pigs and human beings. Despite eventual containment of the outbreak through a mass cull of more than a million pigs, a related virus has since emerged outside southeast Asia, causing outbreaks in Bangladesh and India.\nSARS\nIn 2003, southeast Asia's unique combination of strong links with other Asian countries alongside a multitude of intercontinental connections (three of the world's 30 busiest airports are now found in southeast Asia\u2014Bangkok, Jakarta, and Singapore) facilitated the regional and global spread of the SARS coronavirus from its origins in southern China, a close neighbour. Guests infected in a hotel in Hong Kong (where an infected doctor from China was staying) unknowingly carried the virus to several countries including Vietnam and Singapore.15 Outbreaks occurred in both of these countries and cases were reported throughout the region, although Singapore was the most severely affected with 33 deaths compared with 11 across the rest of southeast Asia.7 Singapore was also implicated in international transmission to outside the region. Although the global outbreak ended in July, 2003, a further laboratory-acquired infection was reported in Singapore in September, 2003.\nH5N1 influenza\nIn the same year as SARS spread through southeast Asia, the region began to experience outbreaks of another emerging infectious disease, H5N1 influenza, which had again spread from southern China.16 Although the very high mortality in domestic poultry (approaching 100%) was alarming, the number of human infections that were occurring and the deaths of many of those infected (human case fatality in southeast Asia was just under 70%)5 caused greater concern. The previous rapid worldwide dissemination of the SARS coronavirus fuelled fears that the H5N1 virus, were it to become readily transmissible between humans and retain some of its pathogenic potential, could spread rapidly and result in an influenza pandemic that might kill millions, result in untold economic disruption, and threaten global security.17 Despite these grave concerns, the H5N1 virus has yet to cause an influenza pandemic owing to an inability to achieve sustained human-to-human spread (although there is evidence to support some human-to-human transmission events).18, 19 However, the threat still remains. The virus continues to circulate in wild birds worldwide, causing outbreaks in poultry in several southeast Asian countries, and, in 2010, cases in human beings have been reported in southeast Asia in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.\nArtemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria\nReports of reduced Plasmodium falciparum clearance rates during treatment with artemisinin (in combination therapy as well as monotherapy) have surfaced in southeast Asia, namely on the Thailand\u2013Cambodia border, since 2004.14 These reports have attracted much regional and international concern, especially in view of southeast Asia's historical role in the emergence and spread of parasite resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine, and the reliance of the global Roll Back Malaria campaign on artemisinin combination therapy. Although a containment programme, currently funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is in place, there is an acceptance that \u201cthe actual geographic extent of resistance is unknown\u201d.20\n",

The estimated cost of SARS to east and southeast Asia was US$18 billion, which is roughly US$2 million per person infected.24 In southeast Asia, the sudden collapse in demand for the service industry was a dominant feature in this cost, particularly in view of a tourist industry reliant on the 35 million tourists arriving every year from outside the region.25 Indeed, the relation between public health and socioeconomic effects is by no means linear. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK illustrated this effect. Fear, anxiety, and changes in behaviour and the effect on the tourist industry have unpredictable consequences. Before 2009, the World Bank estimated a possible global cost of an influenza pandemic at around US$1\u00b725 to 2 trillion.26 The Asian Development Bank estimated a shock to demand might cost southeast Asia up to US$283 billion.27 Moreover, the costs of emerging infectious diseases, including pandemics, do not fall evenly. Although emerging infectious diseases have until now disproportionately affected low-income countries,1 and the poorest within society were affected the most,28 pandemics have the potential to disrupt highly interconnected and high-income areas such as Singapore.27, 29\n",

Control policies during the 2003\u201304 H5N1 outbreak in Vietnam led to the culling of 45 million birds at an estimated cost of almost US$118 million.30 Furthermore, insufficient reimbursement after a ban on the sale of so-called backyard poultry in Vietnam lowered the household income for poor families disproportionately by comparison with wealthier families.26 In Thailand, where the highly industrialised poultry export market is an important contributor to the national economy, exports were banned.31 In 2003, poultry meat exports were worth US$597\u00b76 million. A year later, they had had fallen by 93% to US$43\u00b75 million.32 Avian influenza continues to exact an economic strain in the region, with new cases in poultry or wild birds reported this year from Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar (Indonesia is endemic for H5N1 in birds, but does not report current outbreaks).

Along with trade, the natural movements of migratory birds and bats within, to, and from the region are also a key influence for several emerging infectious diseases such as H5N1 influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and Nipah virus.",

Moreover, there has been a particularly large increase, of more than 30% across the region, in the land area used for rice cultivation.32 Development of rice paddies can promote transmission of vector-borne diseases such as Japanese encephalitis through their role as vector-breeding sites and by attracting water birds, which are the natural reservoir of Japanese encephalitis. Transmission between birds and mosquitoes is further amplified by transmission in pigs.21 Countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar are at risk of increases in Japanese encephalitis because of the combination of intensified rice and pig farming and the absence of vaccination programmes and surveillance.45 In addition to an increased potential for transmission of Japanese encephalitis, the attraction of various birds to rice paddies has also been associated with increased risk of H5N1 outbreaks in Thailand and Vietnam.46\n",

Although backyard and village farms remain the predominant environment for poultry producers in most low-income countries in southeast Asia, industrial production systems dominate in others, such as Thailand.30, 48 Where poultry production is in a backyard setting or is on a small scale, investment in biosecurity is likely to be low and ill-coordinated. Many species often coexist and the potential for cross-species transmission can be increased. However, as intensive production of single species in large-scale industrial and commercial sectors is becoming more dominant, although this setting might reduce the risk of cross-species infection, these sites might also act as amplifiers of disease during the emergence of large-scale outbreaks. Moreover, cross-infection can still occur within the marketplace, where economic imperatives can over-ride public health concerns.39\n",

            "text": "These initiatives are emerging in a complex regional environment, however. At a national level, thriving private health-care sectors in many countries increasingly pose challenges to reporting systems, with some being either unwilling or unable to provide information.60 Similar challenges arise from decentralised health systems\u2014for example, in Indonesia and the Philippines, where local health authorities have become less active in case reporting compared with other countries.61 Where vertical disease-specific surveillance programmes have been developed, such as in Cambodia, there is a risk that parallel surveillance and laboratory testing systems, especially those funded through investments related to pandemic influenza preparedness or other global health initiatives, draw on limited existing capacity and contribute to a duplication of efforts and inefficient use of resources.62 In addition to the regional initiatives that we have described, several collaborative surveillance programmes and support structures exist, with input from the Western Pacific Regional Office and the South East Asia Regional Office of WHO (which themselves split southeast Asia along political lines that are different from those of ASEAN). These programmes include the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance network (an innovative cross-border initiative; panel 2\n), the Southeast Asian Medical Information Centre, ASEAN, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.Panel 2The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance initiative\u2014cross-border surveillance and responseThe Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) initiative was established in 1999 with the core values of \u201cmutual trust, transparency [and] cooperative spirit\u201d.63 Encompassing Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam as well as China's Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, the MBDS network straddles both the WHO South East Asia Regional Office and Western Pacific Regional Office regions, aiming to facilitate cross-border cooperation in surveillance and control of infectious disease.A network of cross-border surveillance collaborations underpins the project, each consisting of two community-based surveillance sites, one on each side of the border, which report cases from a defined list of infectious diseases (webappendix p 6).These sites have been responsible for notable successes of the MBDS\u2014for example, the discovery of a Laotian infected with influenza A H5N1 in Thailand and the subsequent joint Lao\u2013Thai investigation. Another example was the joint Lao\u2013Thai investigation of a cholera outbreak that spread from Thailand to Laos with identification of the source, enabling coordinated control measures to be implemented. The scope of the project extends beyond joint monitoring and investigations. For example, cross-border medical care from Thailand was dispatched to Myanmar after cyclone Nargis in 2008. The completion of a regional tabletop pandemic preparedness exercise in Siem Reap, Cambodia, in 2007, further serves as an example of international collaboration through the initiative.The signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding in 200764 reflected these successes, and the latest MBDS Action Plan63 seeks to further cross-border cooperation with activities that include:\n\u2022Establishment of two new cross-border sites per country per year.\u2022Regular meetings between participants and leaders at cross-border sites to discuss progress and share experiences.\u2022Annual documentation of outbreak investigations or exercises at each site.\u2022Ensuring sufficient clinical capacity, health-care workers, and personal protective equipment as well as adequate capacity for patient isolation and quarantine.\nSuccesses of the MBDS initiative have shown the potential for collaborative efforts between resource-poor nations to meet WHO's 2005 International Health Regulations. MBDS might be a potential model to establish similar networks in other regions worldwide and to strengthen existing informal collaborations in regions with national tensions, such as the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance (Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority).65\n",

            "text": "In an effort to address some of the weaknesses in surveillance in southeast Asia, several collaborative programmes for infectious disease research have been undertaken in association with Western countries. Some of these collaborations are very well integrated into the existing health system structure\u2014for example, the Institut Pasteur, whose facilities have become national institutes in several major provinces of Vietnam. The Institut Pasteur network also includes a facility in Phnom Penh in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health in Cambodia, and another is under construction in Laos in formal association with the Laotian Ministry of Health. In Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health is also actively collaborating with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work on emerging infectious and tropical diseases, and the Thai and US armies have a collaborative infectious disease research laboratory, the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, which developed from a cholera research laboratory in 1958.66 The Wellcome Trust centres in Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos have had a longstanding presence, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has a research collaborating centre in the region, in Thailand. Indonesia's recent experience of collaborating with external infectious disease laboratories has been more problematic. Before closing down in 2008, the US Naval Medical Research Unit 2 in Indonesia was charged with political accusations of offering questionable benefit to Indonesians during its 30 years of operation and of alleged improper use and export of viral specimens67\u2014themes that were to resonate globally with the ongoing debate about the sharing of biological materials and benefits that might accrue from the development of vaccines (panel 3\n).Panel 3Indonesia, virus sharing, and equitable access to vaccinesIn February, 2007, amid growing international concern over the threat of pandemic influenza, Indonesia's health minister announced that her country would no longer share avian influenza A H5N1 virus samples with WHO. This controversial decision was triggered by a dispute over property rights between the Indonesian Government and an Australian company that had used viral strains from Indonesia to produce and market an H5N1 influenza vaccine. Indonesia argued that the incident exposed wider issues of exploitation and global inequalities\u2014pharmaceutical companies obtain, free of charge, viral samples that are shared by developing countries with WHO, then patent the resulting products and sell them at prohibitively expensive prices, thus providing benefits disproportionately to high-income countries.68\nThe controversy forced WHO and its member states to reconsider the current approach to global influenza surveillance and the sharing of biological materials, and to create new mechanisms for benefit sharing. To this aim, in May, 2007, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution that promoted the \u201ctransparent, fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the generation of information, diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and other technologies\u201d,68 while reasserting the need for timely sharing of both information and biological samples with the Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Additionally, it established an intergovernmental meeting to consider further actions aimed at ensuring fair and equitable distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines.69\nIn 2008, after many debates and negotiations, the Indonesian Government agreed to share H5N1 influenza sequences (but not the viral samples) through the new Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data.70 The dispute and its underlying issues, however, have not been settled. In 2009, Indonesia did not share any samples with the Global Influenza Surveillance Network, including those from pandemic influenza A H1N1. Moreover, the initial efforts to create a more equitable framework for the purchase and distribution of vaccines have not produced any substantial results thus far. Disagreement has arisen because high-income countries are reluctant to accept the suggestion of legally binding obligations to share the benefits of vaccines that accrue from sharing of biological samples, whereas many low-income and middle-income countries, notably Indonesia, Thailand, and Brazil, want to see binding obligations.71\n",

For example, three countries in the region (Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia) spend less per head than has been estimated to be necessary for health system functions to meet the Millennium Development Goals.57 There are substantial shortages of human resources in some countries in the region.74 The density of health-care professionals in five of the ten countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam) is lower than the level defined by WHO as adequate. The availability of health-care facilities as proxied by number of hospital beds per head is also very low in Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia.75 With existing weakness in health system capacity, many countries in southeast Asia are at risk of being unable to adequately respond to emerging threats from new and re-emerging diseases or to surges in demand that might accompany these diseases. A study that included five southeast Asian countries showed that wide disparities exist in resource capacity not only in aggregate between countries, but also within countries. The northeast of Thailand has, for example, gaps in some health service resources that are more similar to the distribution in Laos and Cambodia than that of central Thailand. Ongoing research within our group suggests that these disparities probably result in inequitable rates of preventable mortality from emerging infectious diseases.60, 76\n",

This trend should be complemented by a commitment to address imbalances in health system capacity. The European Union model for structural funds could provide a way forward.\u2022Emphasis on avian influenza A H5N1 with concomitant funding has meant the relative neglect of lower profile diseases such as Japanese encephalitis and rabies. Although generic capacity building across emerging infectious diseases is to be welcomed (for example, through the International Ministerial Conference on Animal and Pandemic Influenza79) this process needs to be built on with sustained and strategically focused funding.\u2022Investment in the region needs to be sustained to ensure robust, resilient, and flexible institutional capacity.\u2022Research needs to be done to improve understanding of the factors that are associated with risk of emerging infectious diseases.\u2022Surveillance capacity needs to be strengthened, especially in low-income countries, and needs to be timely, coordinated regionally, and inform national and regional control priorities.\u2022Predictive analyses need to be strengthened, including through the development of more robust datasets on factors associated with emerging infectious diseases such as changes in land use.\u2022International and domestic governance of surveillance of animal and human infectious diseases need to be strategically aligned across geographic, institutional, disease, and host boundaries, and avoid duplication of effort\u2022Analyses of operational prevention, containment, and mitigation capacity are needed to inform investment linked to global, regional, and domestic public health and economic priorities\n",
