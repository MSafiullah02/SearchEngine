It has now been established that SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that had previously not been described (1) . Although the majority of patients with SARS recover, SARS can have a severe clinical course and may result in death. Children appear to be less susceptible to SARS both in numbers and severity (2) . Many aspects of this new disease are however still unknown. Predicting further evolution of SARS and its impact upon childhood health is largely speculative at the moment. Like many other viral infections of the airways, SARS may perhaps become a permanent respiratory tract pathogen with which we will have to deal with and which will become part of our routine differential diagnoses for acute respiratory symptoms. Perhaps, it may even be possible, although unlikely, that SARS may be eradicated in the near future. At present, the future of SARS is certainly an enigma, and far more studies are needed to unravel the mysteries of this new disease, its origin and its future.",

The fact that children developed a milder form of illness is not unique to infection with the SARS coronavirus, as a number of other respiratory infections behave in the same way, such as influenza, infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae, and even varicella. One possible explanation is that children may enjoy cross-immunity persisting after recent exposures to other coronaviruses. Crossprotection from childhood vaccination [e.g. measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine] has also been postulated in the popular press (14), but no scientific data on the subject are available. However, if children were protected by MMR vaccination, it would be expected that younger non-vaccinated children would develop severe SARS but this has not been the case. Furthermore, there is no reason why adults should not also be protected by MMR vaccination.",

From an anatomopathological study on postmortem lung samples of SARS patients, a giant-cell infiltrate was seen with a pronounced increase in macrophages (CD68-positive cells) in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lungs (16) . This infiltrate is different from the infiltrate seen in non-SARS ARDS, which comprises activated neutrophils (and has increased levels of interleukin 8) , and which can occur in both adults and children (17) . Therefore, it seems that activated macrophages play an important role in severe SARS. The lack of activation of macrophages by SARS-CoV could be the reason why children do not develop severe SARS (i.e. ARDS during the second phase). A possibility could be that children lack expression of the receptors for SARS-CoV on their macrophages. Although, children are vulnerable to non-SARS coronaviruses, it could be that the SARS-CoV uses different receptors. It has been shown that the first step in HCoV-229E infection is binding of the trimeric 200-KDa viral spike glycoprotein (S) to its receptor on human cells, identified as human aminopeptidase N (hAPN, CD13) (18) . SARS-CoV likely uses other receptors to penetrate into macrophages.

A much dreaded possibility is that it could in the future similarly affect children. For now, at least, we can infer from our observations that SARS does not have a significant impact on childhood asthma, and that there is no indication to radically change treatment strategies for asthmatic children. There are however many urgent questions that are in need of answers: Why does SARS preferentially affect adults? Are there differences in immune response between adults and children to SARS? What is the future behavior of SARS? Will there be new mutations of this virus with increasing virulence and infectivity?",

Inhibition studies of binding by antibodies developed against peptides from S, suggest that the receptor-binding domain is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537. These results also confirm that ACE2 is a functional receptor for the SARS virus and may help in the elucidation of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV entry and in the development of vaccine immunogens and entry inhibitors (4).",
