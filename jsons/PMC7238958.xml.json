After an initial diffusion in China, Italy represents one of the most affected countries, with more than 90,000 cases at March 28, 2020 (Fig. 1). This health emergency, as we all know, forced governmental agencies to adopt restrictive measures to contain the infection. All this has led to an inevitable reorganization of healthcare facilities, with consequent modification of daily clinical and surgical activity. In this scenario, various international surgical societies constantly update the indications on how to adapt the surgical activity on current conditions, and some Italian investigators have already published their experience and the consequent suggestions [1\u20134].",

Use of enhanced personal protection equipment (PPE) (anything more than standard surgical mask, gown and gloves) was adopted routinely in 5 (12.8%), only in known and/or suspected COV2+ cases in 22 (56.4%) and never in 12 (30.8%) centers.

General surgery units have been affected as well by a drastic change in daily procedures. Main issues that affect surgical care are represented by the need to save resources requested for the treatment of actual and expected patients with COV2 infection, and to develop adequate measures to prevent the spread of the disease in patient as well as healthcare professionals. These aspects are severely impacting the treatment of COV2, as well as non-COV2 patients, and the daily activity of surgical teams. Even the request for surgical treatment underwent deep changes: access to health care services decreased as a direct consequence of strict regulations reducing people mobility and crowding; many patients spontaneously postponed both consultations and already scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.",

Among them, major Italian surgical societies developed a joint guidance [8] for surgical practice during this pandemic. All these guidelines and recommendations share the same common baseline: they are based on low level evidences published mostly before the outbreak and point out a precautionary approach due to the lack of any strong scientific evidence. A common advice in such guidelines is to postpone as long as possible elective surgery, based on two reasons: the necessity/opportunity to reallocate as many health resources as possible to the management of COV2+ patients and the observation that unexpected and severe complications and related mortality, even in elective cases [1], have been reported, possibly related to the onset of severe infection in the perioperative period. It is established that COV2 infection has a high lethality in comorbid conditions, and patients in the postoperative phase could be a subgroup in which COVID19 may have a high lethality rate [9]. Thus, in case of urgent and mandatory elective interventions [10], it will be necessary to remodel the therapeutic pathways in the light of the changed resources (in particular the very low availability of intensive care beds).",

It is documented also that the virus has tropism even for non-respiratory mucosal surfaces such as the conjunctiva [12]. The high prevalence of infected patients, mostly asymptomatic, and the limited possibility to perform sensitive diagnostic tests makes every surgical procedure at risk of viral spreading. As a matter of fact, in two out of three elective colorectal resections performed on COV2+ patients in this survey (Table 2) the diagnosis of viral infection through RT-PCR analysis on naso-pharyngeal swabs was obtained in the postoperative period due to the onset of unexplained postoperative fever.",

Very few papers studied the contamination linked to laparoscopic approach [16], without identifying recommended risk-reducing procedures. Even clear and evidence-based reports concerning the clinical efficacy of facemasks [17] are lacking, entailing a great variety, sometimes conflicting, of guidelines, recommendations and policies, pointing out the need for further research in this area. Current guidelines for the protection of health care workers in the operating room are somewhat conflicting: they go from nothing more than standard surgical protection [18] to the use of N95 respirators or respirators that offer a higher level of protection [19]. According to the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) classification of particulate filtering facepiece respirators, N95 respirators are not resistant to oil with a filtering efficiency of 95%. The European Standard (EN 149:2001) classification divides particulate filtering facepiece respirators into three classes: FFP1, FFP2, and FFP3 with corresponding minimum filtration efficiencies of 80%, 94%, and 99%. Therefore, FFP2 and N95 respirators can be considered equivalent [20], making them recommended for use in the prevention of airborne infectious diseases in the US and other countries.",

Our survey confirms that a high percentage of the centers have been affected by the epidemic: although only 15.5% of the surgical units had a reduction in staff, the staff was partially reallocated to non-surgical services in 40% of the remaining. The change in allocation of resources had a great impact on the volume of activity: 1 out of 3 centers reduced the colorectal cancer surgery volume, although less than 1 out of 5 continues operating fragile patients with possible need for postoperative intensive care. The average number of cases operated, however, has significantly reduced, and in about half of the centers the waiting times have lengthened. Although no recommendation about changes in surgical techniques was made, some centers declared an increase of the use of terminal or diverting stomas, probably aiming at minimizing the need for post-operative intensive care and possible system overload consequent to the management of anastomotic leakage. All these factors have a severe impact on the treatment of non-COV2 cases: we must therefore prepare for the prioritization of cases and we can expect an increase of late diagnosis of patients with colorectal cancer. We can expect an increase of workload for the treatment of non-urgent diseases after the resolution of pandemic, but also an increase of urgent cases due to non-electively treated cases of benign diseases. Therefore, the impact on therapeutic pathways can be expected to continue for a long time.",
