Experimental surgeons had recently devised the vascular anastomosis as a way of connecting the cut end of blood vessels, and that advance created the field of vascular surgery. The vascular anastomosis would allow the repair of traumatic wounds and the penetration of surgery deeper into body cavities. However, those who developed the procedure realized the vascular anastomosis might also prove to be the critical technical advance needed to replace a sick organ with a healthy one, i.e., for organ transplantation.1 As exciting as the prospect of organ replacement seemed to be, it was not clear then how one could obtain an organ from a human for transplantation. It was reasoned then that since some cellular components of the kidney and other organs often remain alive long after a person is deceased, harvesting a kidney from a cadaver would be unethical. Because of this concern, the first application of the vascular anastomosis to replacement of organ function was conducted using animals \u2013 swine and sheep \u2013 as a source of organs instead of humans.",

When a virus causes organ failure, xenotransplantation might be preferred to avoid infection of the transplanted organ. This approach has already been attempted for treatment of cirrhosis caused by hepatitis virus and loss of immune competence caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A xenograft (or at least a xenogeneic organ) might be used as a temporary measure to preserve life or health until healing occurs (or until a human organ becomes available). Thus, the blood of subjects with fulminant hepatic failure has been through swine livers as a way of improving the subject's condition so that the patient could undergo allotransplantation. Xenografts might be used to deliver genes or gene products for complex metabolic pathways, exploiting the ability to express heterologous genes at high levels in genetically engineered animals. Xenografts (human-to-animal) have even been advanced as systems that might coax the differentiation of stem cells into functional tissues and organs.3\n",

Activation of the alternative pathway of complement appears to provide a primary barrier to xenotransplants between many combinations of donor and recipient species.

In experimental models, agents such as cobra venom factor, which activates the alternative pathway of complement, and soluble complement receptor type 1 have been found to provide sufficient protection to allow survival of organ xenografts for periods of days to weeks. Despite the obvious advantages of administering complement inhibitors, this approach has several important limitations. First, the action of complement inhibitors is transient, whereas complement activation persists. Second, systemic inhibition of complement compromises host defense against infections. The alternative, and now standard, approach to controlling activation of complement is to express complement regulatory proteins of the recipient as the product of transgenes in the would-be source of xenografts.6 For example, expression of human decay-accelerating factor, CD59, and membrane cofactor protein in transgenic pigs has led to prolonged survival of organs from those pigs transplanted into nonhuman primates.5., 7.\n",

Depletion of xenoreactive antibodies by passage of blood through xenogeneic organs or through immunoaffinity columns has helped to demonstrate that antibodies induce much of the activation of complement in xenogeneic organ grafts and has provided some prolongation of graft survival. On the other hand, no regimen of immunosuppressive drugs yet tested has effectively inhibited production of natural antibodies (cyclosporine, leflunamide, and some other agents have helped to a varying extent to limit production of elicited antibodies). Various strategies have been devised to induce tolerance to Gal\u03b11-3Gal. For example, \u03b11,3-galactosyl transferase has been expressed in bone marrow cells of a would-be recipient, and this has apparently led to tolerance to Gal\u03b11-3Gal in rodents. However, no approach to induction of tolerance tested to date, including the induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism,9 has yielded an enduring state of tolerance to Gal\u03b11-3Gal in nonhuman primates. Rather, the most effective way to deal with natural anti-Gal\u03b11-3Gal antibodies is the production of pigs with targeted disruption of \u03b11,3-galactosyl transferase.10 Organs from such pigs contain little Gal\u03b11-3Gal and survive for prolonged periods after transplantation into nonhuman primates.11., 12. However, the recipients of organs from the Gal\u03b11-3Gal-deficient pigs were always treated with other manipulations, so it is difficult to know how much of the prolongation of survival is owed only to the absence of Gal\u03b11-3Gal.13\n",

The mechanisms that give rise to cytotoxicity are thought to include the following: (1) failure of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on the xenogeneic target to interact with killer inhibitory receptors of NK cells; (2) stimulation of Fc\u03b3II receptors on NK cells by xenoreactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) bound to xenogeneic cells; and (3) stimulation of lectin receptors on NK cells by saccharides such as Gal\u03b11-3Gal on the xenogeneic target cells and activation of other cytotoxicity receptors. To what extent NK cells damage organ transplants is uncertain, as immunodeficient animals with normal NK activity can accept allografts and xenografts. However, some recent studies suggest that NK cells can induce vascular injury over a period of time, especially in xenografts. NK cells might also promote antigen presentation and, thus, elicit immune responses directed against the xenograft; these responses appear to be a main limitation of application of xenotransplantation. Perhaps because of uncertainties about the importance of NK cells in the barrier to xenotransplantation, therapeutic strategies for inhibiting these cells have been discussed but so far have not been advanced. Among the considerations are transgenic expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E or other stimulators of inhibitory receptors.",

T-cell responses to xenogeneic cells appear to be defective when evaluated in vitro because cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules produced by xenogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) act poorly on responding T cells. However, xenogenic APCs can present foreign MHC antigen to T cells, presumably through the use of alternative co-stimulatory pathways and cross-reactive properties of T-cell receptors. T cells may also respond in vitro to foreign peptides presented by self-APC. Although the nature and intensity of T-cell responses to xenotransplantation are still not completely known, the response is likely to be at least as intense as the response to allotransplantation, owing to the diverse set of antigenic peptides, an amplifying effect of humoral immunity and inflammation on cellular immune responses, and defective immune regulation.14\n",

Since cell-mediated immunity depends to a certain extent on T-cell responses that are more or less MHC-restricted, the recipient might not control viruses and other intracellular organisms that invade the graft. Thus, the factors, such as MHC restriction, incompatibility of cytokines and cell dhesion molecules that impair T-cell responses to xenogeneic cells, discussed above, might have the greatest impact on host defense. At present, this limitation is theoretical; however, some who conduct experimental transplants have noticed that viruses such as CMV may engender more severe or more complicated problems in the recipients of xenografts than in the recipients of allografts.",

The application of transplantation for the treatment of human disease is significantly constrained by a shortage of human organs, and overcoming the immunological barriers to xenotransplantation would surely solve that problem. Whether xenotransplantation is applied for this purpose and to what extent will also depend on advances made in other technologies.3., 19. One might imagine that cloning and new applications for stem cells could efface or even eliminate the demand for xenotransplantation. However, interest in xenotransplantation will likely persist, despite the failure to overcome the immunological barriers and the advance of alternative technologies. Such interest should stem from xenotransplantation as an experimental model. Thus, today, one can find no better or more rigorous model than a xenograft for testing the efficacy of therapeutics for the complement or coagulation systems. Furthermore, xenografts have provided very powerful models for elucidating the mechanism of complement-mediated injury, the pathophysiology of endothelial cell activation, and the biological phenomenon of accommodation.6 Finally, xenografts have begun to teach unexpected lessons, such as the developmental implications of cell fusion and mechanisms of transfer of viruses between species.18\n",

Organ xenografts are subject to vascular types of rejection, including hyperacute, acute vascular, and chronic rejection. Vascular rejection, particularly hyperacute and acute vascular rejection, are caused by the binding of antibodies and activation of complement of the recipient on xenogeneic blood vessels. Having blood vessels originating with the recipient, cell and tissue xenografts are not subject to this type of problem. Accommodation refers to acquired resistance to injury. Organ xenografts are also susceptible to cellular rejection. (B) The outcome of free tissue and cell xenotransplants. Cell and tissue xenografts derive their blood supply through the in-growth of blood vessels of the recipient. Since the blood vessels of these grafts are constructed from cells of the recipient, antibodies of the recipient do not generally bind to the blood vessels, and hence vascular diseases of organ grafts such as hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are not observed. Free tissue and cell xenografts are mainly subject to injury by T cells that have the ability to migrate effectively through blood vessels walls, causing primary nonfunction and cellular rejection.",

When the virus is activated and buds from the \u2018infected\u2019 cell, it acquires surface proteins from the uninfected fusion partner (red) and is thus capable of infecting other similar cells by viral entry.
