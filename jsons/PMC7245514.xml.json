Indeed, this was the most serious economic calamity since the inter-war Great Depression. The troubles arose around sub-market housing mortgages in the US in 2007, turning into a full-blown Credit Crunch in the following year. The crisis shook the foundations of Western capitalism, bringing economic uncertainty, severe public austerity and increased hardship on the ordinary public, which largely felt victimized by both business and political elites.",

This was a financial tsunami without precedent in contemporary times. The crunch also illustrated a vulnerability in the internationalized economy of the West.",

Leaders on the continent responded to the crisis with imposing severe austerity measures onto vulnerable countries that were most seriously affected by the malaise. In effect, leaders in Berlin and Paris and other powerful players within the EU were able to coerce authorities in Athens, Rome, Lisbon, Madrid and in other economically weaker EU capitals to accept grave financial burdens in exchange for direly needed bailout, in order to save their countries from defaults\u2014which in turn was threatening to turn into a domino-effect of bankruptcies around the continent.",

Most of these parties had abandoned open xenophobia, rather dressing their messages within more acceptable rhetoric. In the UK for instance, the more toned down populist UK Independence Party was replacing the openly racist BNP, which I discussed in the previous chapter. Later, the Brexit Party took over the rollers for a while. In France, the National Rally (previously named the National Front) found renewed support under the leadership of the more composed-looking Marine Le Pen, who had replaced her more aggressive father Jean-Marie Le Pen.",

Prior to the 2019 elections, European far-right populists had attempted to forge a continental alliance under the leadership of Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen in France. The US far-right strategist Steve Bannon was also trying to unite European populists in his Brussels-based group called The Movement. Bannon described Brussels as the beating heart of the globalist project, and said he wanted to \u2018drive the stake through the vampire\u2019 until the whole system started to disintegrate (qtd in Lewis 2018).",

One of their dividing issues was that of Russia. While Salvini, Le Pen and Orb\u00e1n aligned with Vladimir Putin, especially due to his opposition to both the US and the EU, others were more wary of Russia, for instance the Scandinavians and those in the Baltics, as well as also Kaczynski of Law and Justice in Poland.",

In this latest version, a clandestine elite within the state apparatus is accused of manipulating American politics and government in a co-ordinated and systematic manner. Most proponents of this theory point to bureaucracies of the military complex and to spy agencies. Among them was the president himself. Donald Trump for instance described the Deep State as \u2018real, illegal and a threat to national security\u2019 (qtd in Porter 2017). In a 2017 poll, ABC News and The Washington Post found that almost half of Americans believed in a conspiratorial Deep State in the US. ",

Leading up to a visit by US President Barack Obama, who was expected to come out against Brexit and say that in the case of a leave vote, it would take a long time to negotiate a trade deal between the USA and the UK, many of the Brexiters took to undermining the US president\u2019s credibility. Ahead of the visit, in the tabloid The Sun, the then London Mayor Boris Johnson said that due to Obama\u2019s part-Kenyan ancestry, Obama had a dislike of the British Empire. To underpin the claim, Johnson insisted that precisely because of that reason Obama had removed a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office in Washington upon taking office as US President. After Johnson was criticized for covert dog-whistle racism UKIP leader Nigel Farage came to his defence. Farage wrote that Obama indeed \u2018bears a bit of a grudge against this country because of his grandfather and Kenya and colonialization\u2019 (qtd in Bennett 2016).",

Johnson however mainly made a name for himself with more quirky stories, ridiculing the EU. One ran under the headline \u2018 Italy fails to measure up on condoms.\u2019 Johnson mockingly wrote that \u2018 Brussels bureaucrats have shown their legendary attention to detail by rejecting new specifications for condom dimensions.\u2019 He said that this was \u2018despite demands from the Italian rubber industry for a smaller minimum width\u2019.

Our conversation reminded me that political patronage does not always follow the lines that we might expect.

Although admitting that Obama might not himself have physically established the terrorist organization, he still insisted that Obama had been the most valuable actor in their formation: \u2018I give him the most valuable player award.\u2019 Trump moved on to also implicate his rival in the presidential election with the founding of Isis: \u2018I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.\u2019 When criticized for without merit implicating Obama with the notorious terrorist organization, Trump reiterated his claim: \u2018I don\u2019t care.

Ok?\u201915 Indeed, this was Mr Trump\u2019s modus operandi\u2014irrespective of the circumstances he was prone to always double down on his opponents. In line with his science denialism, his disrespect for the establishment and experts, Trump initially brushed off most warnings around the imminent Coronavirus Crisis in early 2020, calling it a \u2018hoax\u2019 and saying for example that the matter was \u2018under control\u2019 and that the virus would \u2018miraculously disappear\u2019 (Paz 2020). Prior to the outbreak he had undermined, and even in some cases dismantled, several institutions tasked with analysing threats like these, for instance when shutting the National Security Council\u2019s pandemic unit. He didn\u2019t seem to comprehend the calamity, claiming instead that the crisis was being overblown in media to hurt him in the upcoming elections. The failure to respond left the US unprepared, leading to a far greater crisis than occurred in countries where authorities responded earlier and in accordance to established knowledge and advice of experts.",

Organizations of American white nationalist movements have been on the rise in recent years. Their most common discussion theme was indeed that of the White Genocide conspiracy theory. Perhaps unsurprisingly, J. M. Berger (2016) found that most white nationalists in America supported Donald Trump for President. Apart from white genocide, they referred to him more often than to any other topic in 2016. Their most tweeted video on YouTube was a documentary titled Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told. The collection of footage insists that Hitler was not the monster that the mainstream media and elite academia portrayed him as being, but that he, in fact, was a brave fighter against the world\u2019s most evil forces, that is, Zionist bankers and economic elite (Berger 2016).",
