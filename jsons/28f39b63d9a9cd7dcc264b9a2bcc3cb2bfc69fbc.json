Methods : Seventy-nine children with wheezing requiring hospitalization at age <2 years were prospectively followed up and re-investigated at age 5.6 -8.8 years when the measurements of baseline lung function and bronchial responsiveness to exercise were performed. Results : At early school age, 23% of children had decreased lung function, and 13% had increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise. Predictors of decreased lung function were maternal history of smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 12.8; 95% confi dence interval [CI]: 1.2 -139.6), parental history of asthma (OR, 4.3; 95%CI: 1.1 -17.1), and female gender (OR, 4.0; 95%CI: 1.2 -13.7). Increased bronchial responsiveness was associated with rhinovirus infectioninduced wheezing in infancy (OR, 6.5; 95%CI: 1.2 -36.3), and early cat or dog exposure leading to sensitization (OR, 26.6; 95%CI: 1.3 -525.2). Inhaled anti-infl ammatory therapy was common in children with rhinovirus infection-induced wheezing in infancy ( n \u03ed 13/19; P \u03ed 0.001 vs children with other/no confi rmed virus infection etiology for wheezing in infancy, n \u03ed 16/60), which may have improved lung function and attenuated bronchial responsiveness in them. Conclusions : After early childhood wheezing requiring hospitalization, one-fourth of children will have decreased lung function and one-eighth of children will show increased bronchial responsiveness at school age. Gender, heredity of asthma, and antenatal exposure to tobacco smoke are predictors of decreased lung function, whereas rhinovirus infection etiology of wheeze and early animal exposure leading to sensitization are associated with increased bronchial responsiveness later in childhood.

The episode of wheezing was the fi rst one in 68 children (86%); 11 children (14%) had a history of one previous episode of wheezing confi rmed by a physician. Fourteen children (18%) had a parental history of asthma, 38 children (48%) had an exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, including 19 children (24%) with a maternal history of smoking during pregnancy; and 23 children (29%) had atopic dermatitis in infancy. In addition, 23 children (29%) were exposed to furry animals (i.e. cat and/or dog at home or at day care) in infancy, and the early animal exposure led to sensitization (i.e. skin prick test positivity to the animal in question by school age) in four cases and to tolerance in 19 cases.

Heredity of asthma, female gender, and in utero exposure to tobacco smoke predicted subnormal lung function parameters; and rhinovirus infection-induced wheeze in infancy and early animal exposure leading to sensitization predicted increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise at school age. In addition, especially among children with rhinovirus infection etiology for wheezing in infancy, there were more asthma patients on a continuous inhaled anti-infl ammatory therapy, which may have improved lung function 19 and attenuated bronchial responsiveness. 20 Several studies have confi rmed that pulmonary function is reduced, and bronchial responsiveness is increased years after hospital admission for wheezing in infancy. 4 -6,8,21,22 In the present study lung function was decreased in 23% of children.

That is consistent with current literature stressing the role of sensitization to inhalant allergens as a predictor of persistent wheezing. 27, 28 In addition, rhinovirus infection-induced wheezing in infancy was associated with increased bronchial responsiveness at school age. Such a fi nding is unique, because the role of viruses other than RSV on later lung function and bronchial responsiveness is poorly studied. We found three studies comparing outcomes of RSV-positive and RSV-negative infants with bronchiolitis: in these studies no differences in lung function or airway responsiveness were found at the age of 7 years 5, 22 or later. 29 The authors did not specify the viral etiology of wheeze in RSV-negative children, and the role of rhinoviruses, for instance, remained open. Rhinoviruses, however, are commonly encountered in wheezing children in early childhood, 28 and often precipitate asthma symptoms in school children. 30 In addition, studies on experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have reported increased airway responsiveness in allergic subjects compared with non-allergic ones, 31 and signifi cantly reduced FEV 1 in home recordings by patients with mild atopic asthma. 32 We could not fi nd, however, any previous follow-up studies on lung function and/or bronchial responsiveness after rhinovirus infection-induced wheezing in infancy.",

Another weakness of the study was that FVS was performed only once after the exercise, and that bronchial responsiveness was evaluated only on exercise challenge test. But FVS, when the adequacy of fl ow-volume curve can be checked, gives more reliable information than peak expiratory fl ow and pocket-sized FEV 1 meters. In addition, the exercise challenge test is commonly used, easy to perform, and mimics the everyday activities of children.
