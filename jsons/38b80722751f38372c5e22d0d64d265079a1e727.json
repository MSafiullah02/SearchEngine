Behaviour changes that will slow transmission are different: sexual behaviour and needle sharing for HIV, physical proximity and hand washing for SARS-CoV-2. Early HIV cases doubled over 6-12 months, 2 for SARS-CoV-2 the serial interval is a matter of days. 1 A severe COVID-19 epidemic in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with weak health systems is a sobering prospect. In many ways, the history of HIV prevention is of a failure of global health. Some 32 million have died with sub-Saharan Africa worst affected. 3 But critical lessons have been learnt: three stand out.",

Pandemic HIV transmission accelerated among mobile, well-connected networks, but the burden shifted to poorer people and countries, young women, and marginalised groups. 4 The global burden of COVID-19 will likely fall hardest among older people and vulnerable groups in LMICs. 5 We must track the socioeconomic status and gender of those affected and extend this effort to track the economic impacts. UN member states have pledged that \"no one will be left behind\". The global response to COVID-19 must honour this pledge. Social conditions make it difficult for the vulnerable to change behaviours. Encouragement to \"Abstain, Be Faithful and Use Condoms\" could not prevent HIV where gender inequalities and stigma were the norm. Similarly, following instructions to wash hands and ensure physical distancing will be hardest for those living in poverty. Public-health initiatives must overcome barriers to reach poor people, even if they seem to be less affected by the virus now.",

But the lesson of HIV is that supporting safer behaviours means addressing structures that constrain or enable people's choices. Just as gender-based violence hindered safer sexual behaviour choices for women, the scarcity of clean water will limit handwashing. In the short term, pragmatic responses such as rapid mass distribution of soap, sanitiser, and personal protective equipment for SARS-CoV-2 will be needed (just as female condom distribution was for HIV control).",
