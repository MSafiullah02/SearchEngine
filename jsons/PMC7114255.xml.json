Modeling the spread of epidemics is an important topic in understanding the impact of diseases and designing effective control strategies, and has therefore become a task of utmost importance and attracted a revival of interest from the scientific community. Classical mathematical approaches make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts [7]. However, many infectious diseases are diffused from individual to individual following a heterogeneous contact pattern between them. So the transmission of diseases in the human population can be conveniently abstracted as diseases propagate on complex networks with different structures. Examples include the web of human sexual contacts [8], the distribution of avian influenza [4], and so on. Therefore, the dynamics of epidemics on complex networks [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] and a wide variety of immunization or vaccination strategies, including targeted immunization [19], acquaintance immunization [20], ring immunization [21], etc., are investigated under the framework of complex networks.",

Under a voluntary vaccination mechanism, individuals typically aim at increasing their own interests, so they will balance the cost of vaccination against the risks of infection to decide whether to vaccinate or not in the presence of infection. However, the decision on vaccination is highly dependent on the individuals\u2019 perceived risk of the diseases, which is in turn determined by many factors, such as the prevalence of diseases, the transmission rate of diseases, the duration of diseases, and so on [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Thus, in this paper, the dynamics of infectious diseases on complex networks under the voluntary vaccination mechanism is investigated. Meanwhile, the effects of these factors on the perceived risk of diseases are established by a dynamic programming method in this paper.",

In the second case, we assume individuals are more rational, so the more links/neighbors they have, the higher the probability of being infected. As a result, the perceived risk of infection is not only proportional to the prevalence of the disease but also on the individual\u2019s degree/immediate neighbors (preferential case). Interestingly, even though there is only a small discrepancy between the two cases, completely different results are observed. For example, for the uniform case, the effect of voluntary vaccination on a scale-free network is worse than on random network. For the preferential case, however, the opposite occurs.",

However, in our previous work [35], we showed that diseases can be more effectively controlled on scale-free networks than on random networks when voluntary vaccination mechanisms are considered (see Fig. 2 in Ref. [35]). Though the result is encouraging, we have assumed one ideal situation: each node knows the number of infectious neighbors. In practice, individuals can hardly know how many neighbors are infected. Take sexually transmitted diseases as an example, even when infected, individuals may not want others to know their illnesses for some reasons. As a result, their sexual partners do not know whether he/she is infected.",

From Fig. 2\n(a), one can find that the number of infections on the BA network is larger than on the ER network. Namely, under the voluntary vaccination mechanism, the uniform case is invalid for the BA network. This is a frustrating result as many social contact patterns can be viewed as scale-free networks. A natural question is: whether such worsening will happen in the preferential case too? Luckily, as shown in Fig. 2(b), even the small improvement in the perceived risk function in the preferential case, an exciting result emerges: the number of infections on the BA network is less than that of the ER networks.

However, under the voluntary vaccination mechanism, a higher level of disease leads to more vaccinated persons, so the discussed phenomenon above may change. In Fig. 5\nwe study the final number of infections versus average degree of networks for the two cases. As one can see from Fig. 5(a), for the uniform case, the final number of infections increases with the average degree of network. However, for the preferential case, the final number of infections increases with average degree at first, and then the less favorable situation is controlled when the average degree is large (see Fig. 5(b)). What causes such a distinct result? To answer this question, we reexamine Eqs. (7), (9). From Eq. (7) we can find that the perceived risk function of the uniform case is not related to the degree. As a result, even though the high prevalence of disease for large average degree can provoke more individuals to take vaccination, such an endeavor is not large enough to offset the serious result from the larger average degree, which offers greater conveniences for the spread of the epidemic on networks. For the preferential case, since each individual\u2019s perceived risk function is positively correlated to its degree, when the average degree is so large that everyone\u2019s perceived risk function is larger than the cost of vaccination fvP, then everyone is willing to take vaccination and then the diseases can be eradicated completely.",

However, for hepatitis B, even with the short validity of its vaccine, many people are still willing to take vaccination iteratively because of the high risk of hepatitis B. So, in the following we will investigate the effects of the validity of the vaccine on the spread of epidemics for the uniform case and the preferential case, respectively. To describe the variation of vaccine effectiveness among individuals, we assume that the vaccine validity period Tv for each individual satisfies a normal distribution Tv=N(50,1.0). Namely, the mean value is 50 and the standard deviation is 1.0 (We also take Tv in other forms, generally, the longer the period of validity is, the lower the level of infection is.)",

Such a phenomenon is obvious: once the disease is prevalent, because of the imprecise information on the disease, most individuals choose to take vaccination en masse, the outbreak of the disease is controlled to a very low level, and individuals then relax their vigilance. However, the disease will break out again once the vaccine loses its effect on protecting individuals. Again, most individuals will take vaccination. In this way we observe strong oscillations with time (see Fig. 7(a)). For the preferential case, because \u201clarger nodes\u201d are more diligent in taking vaccination, both the number of infections and the number of vaccinations show damped periodic oscillations and then reach a relative steady state, as shown in Fig. 7(b).",

This suggests perceived risk functions taken by individuals which determine an individual\u2019s decision, and consequently the success or failure of the eradication of infectious diseases. So, in this work, by using the technique of dynamic programming, the perceived risk functions of the uniform case and the preferential case are first established, and then, under the assumption of a voluntary vaccination mechanism, the effects of two different risk assessment systems on the spread of epidemics on complex networks are investigated. We find that there are some similarities and differences between the two cases. For example, for both cases, a smaller discount factor causes a higher proportion/density of infection, and a non-monotonic phenomenon occurs for the number of infections versus transmission rate \u03b2. However, there are significantly different results between two cases. First, due to the high vaccination inclination of \u201clarge nodes\u201d in the preferential case, the effect of controlling the spread of diseases on scale-free networks is much better than the uniform case. Second, for the uniform case, the number of infections increases with the average degree of the networks, yet, for the preferential case, owing to the perceived risk of infection being positively correlated to degree, the number of infections increases first and then decreases to a low level. Furthermore, when the finite period of a vaccine\u2019s validity is considered, perhaps due to the irrationality of individuals in the uniform case, either the number of infections or the number of vaccinations oscillates significantly with time. In this case, individuals\u2019 decisions on whether to take vaccination or not could become collective, which can cause turmoil and nervousness in society when the vaccines are limited. Nevertheless, for the preferential case, because of increased rationality of individuals, both the number of infections and the number of vaccinations may show damped periodic oscillations and then reach a relative steady state.",

According to our analysis, these incorrect decisions may determine the success or failure of the campaign to control diseases. So, government should take measures, such as releasing timely and perfect information about diseases, stopping rumors, etc., to guide the public in reaching the correct decisions. Furthermore, we can find that it is difficult to completely eradicate diseases under voluntary vaccination due to the self-interests of individuals. Thus, in order to completely eradicate the prevalence of diseases, government should take mandatory measures on vaccination or increase subsidies to the public to reduce the cost of vaccination.",
