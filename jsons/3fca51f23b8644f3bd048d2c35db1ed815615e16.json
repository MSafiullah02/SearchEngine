A few months after the first outbreak of SARS, the disease was transmitted worldwide in more than 20 countries of Asia, Europe, and North America. A novel coronavirus (CoV) was detected in patients with SARS and identified as causative agent. Civet cats have been suspected as natural host of SARS CoV, which infects human beings by oral or intranasal route; the infected hosts sheds the virus into air through respiratory route and/or feces from intestinal tract. The routes of entry and shedding of SARS CoV is similar to those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; mouse CoV), which causes a variety of diseases such as diarrhea, hepatitis, encephalitis, and wasting syndrome of nude mice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "To control SARS CoV infection, several disinfectants and tools were examined.
