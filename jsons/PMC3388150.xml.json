At 72 hours after infection with 5 \u00d7 107 CFUs of MRSA per dose, we isolated 1.9 \u00d7 103 CFUs of bacteria from the lungs of PCN-dosed mice and 1.2 \u00d7 109 CFUs of bacteria from the lungs of PBS-dosed mice. Significant decreases in bacterial burden in spleen, liver, and kidney were observed in PCN-dosed mice when compared with PBS-dosed mice (see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Interestingly, the blood of both PCN- and PBS-dosed mice was virtually free of bacteria up to 72 hours after infection and over the range of challenge doses used in multiple experiments (5 \u00d7 107 to 5 \u00d7 108 CFUs; data not shown). The reduction of lung bacterial burden directly correlated to survival of all PCN-dosed mice (Figure 1B). In contrast to PCN-dosed mice, the mortality of PBS-dosed mice reached >50% at 24 hours after infection, which was directly associated with high bacterial burden in lungs. The mortality rate of PBS-dosed mice was dependent on the infectious dose and varied between approximately 50% survival at 72 hours for PBS-dosed BALB/c mice infected with 5 \u00d7 107 CFUs and <20% survival for these mice when infected with 5 \u00d7 108 CFUs of MRSA. In contrast to PBS-dosed mice, PCN-dosed BALB/c mice were entirely protected from MRSA-related mortality in all dose regimens tested (5 \u00d7 107 to 5 \u00d7 108 CFUs).",

By 12 hours after infection, a 10-fold difference in bacterial burden was present between PCN- and PBS-dosed mice; by 72 hours, the lungs of PCN-dosed mice showed more than a millionfold reduction in bacterial burden when compared with PBS-dosed mice (Figure 2A). This decline of bacterial numbers in PCN-dosed mice was coupled with increased numbers of neutrophils and macrophages in the first 12 hours after MRSA infection (Figure 2, B and C). Neutrophils were absent in the lung lavages of PCN- and PBS-dosed mice at infection (0 hours). Significantly more macrophages were present in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice than in the PBS-dosed mice at infection. At 3 hours after infection, the numbers of macrophages in PCN-dosed mice remained significantly higher when compared with PBS-dosed mice, but were notably reduced when compared with uninfected PCN-dosed mice. This decline was most likely a result of migration of macrophages to the lung parenchyma or more firm adherence to alveolar epithelium, a phenomenon described originally by Sonozaki and Cohen38 as a macrophage disappearance reaction. In PCN-dosed mice, neutrophils and macrophages remained elevated between 3 and 12 hours after infection, but were reduced by 24 hours (Figure 2, B and C). After 24 hours, and in compliance with the return of homeostatic conditions in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice, neutrophil numbers were reduced to trace levels, whereas AMs repopulated the lung. In contrast to PCN-dosed mice, the numbers of neutrophils in PBS-dosed mice increased steadily until after 48 hours of infection. The numbers of macrophages in PBS-dosed mice did not start to increase until 48 hours after infection (Figure 2C). Bacterial burden in the lungs of PBS-dosed mice reflected the delayed and/or inefficient macrophage and neutrophil responses and remained high throughout the experiment (Figure 2A).",

In addition, starting at 6 hours after MRSA infection, levels of albumin in BALF of PBS-dosed mice were significantly increased when compared with PCN-dosed mice. This was important because, at 6 hours after infection, no differences in lung bacterial burden were seen between PCN- and PBS-dosed mice. Therefore, the lack of increases in albumin in PCN-dosed mice was indicative of reduced host response-mediated tissue damage in PCN-dosed mice. There were no statistical differences in BALF levels of TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the first 6 hours after MRSA infection between PCN- and PBS-dosed mice (Figure 2D). Between 12 and 24 hours after MRSA infection, when the bacterial burdens in PCN-dosed mice were significantly less, the levels of these inflammatory cytokines started to decline. However, in PBS-dosed mice, these cytokines remained high (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) or continued to increase (MCP-1), which was associated with the lack of infection resolution and consistently high bacterial burden in the lungs of these mice (Figure 2). Interestingly, of the anti-inflammatory cytokines tested, only levels of IL-13 were significantly elevated in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice, up to 8 hours after infection (Figure 2D).",

By gating on the total live cells (confirmed by staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D), we confirmed that at time 0 hours (before MRSA infection), approximately 90% of the cells recovered in the BALF of both PCN- and PBS-dosed mice were CD11c+ (Figure 4A and Table 1). More important, even though >90% of cells in the BALF of PBS-dosed mice were CD11c+, the absolute number of these cells represented just a fraction of CD11c+ cells in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice (Table 1). Early after MRSA infection, the percentage of cells expressing CD11c significantly decreased in the BALF of PBS-dosed mice to approximately 40% at 3 hours after infection and to <10% at 24 hours after infection (Figure 4A). In contrast to PBS-dosed mice, in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice, CD11c+ cells remained at approximately 70% throughout the infection.

We confirmed that CD11c+MHCIIlow cells were also SiglecF+ (and, thus, were AMs) and CD11c+MHCIIhigh cells were SiglecF\u2212 (and, thus, were DCs; data not shown). When compared with PBS-dosed mice, the numbers of total CD11c+ cells, and CD11c+ F4/80+ SiglecF+ AM and SiglecF\u2212 DCs, were significantly higher in PCN-dosed mice before and shortly after MRSA infection (Figure 4, A and B, and Table 1). Even though numbers of AMs (CD11c+SiglecF+ cells in Figure 4B) remained significantly lower in PBS-dosed mice until 48 and 72 hours after infection, the numbers of DCs (CD11c+SiglecF\u2212 cells in Figure 4B and CD11c+MHCIIhigh cells in Figure 4C) in these mice increased rapidly at 12 hours after infection and significantly exceeded the numbers of DCs in PCN-dosed mice at later points after infection (Figure 4B and Table 1). M1 macrophages are considered to be the short-term responders to infections, whereas the M2 phenotype is usually associated with wound healing and less damaging chronic inflammatory responses.47,48 We observed that, in PCN-dosed mice at 4 hours after MRSA infection, there was threefold more M1 (CD11c+ CD206\u2212) than M2 (CD11c+ CD206+) macrophages (Figure 4D). At 8 hours after infection in PCN-dosed mice, the dominance of M1 phenotype was smaller, yet still significant (twofold more of M1 macrophages); at 24 hours after infection, when the bacterial burden in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice was further diminishing (Figure 2A), the M1 prevalence over the M2 phenotype was fivefold. Contrary to PCN-dosed mice, PBS-dosed mice had almost threefold as many M2 macrophages as M1 at 4 hours after infection. At 8 hours after infection in these mice, the numbers of M1 and M2 macrophages in BALF were similar, but at 24 hours after infection, the numbers of M2 cells again exceeded the numbers of M1 cells (Figure 4D).",

By applying cell isolation techniques, we obtained >97% pure population of CD11c+Ly6G\u2212 cells that were F4/80+, as determined by FACS, and >90% pure population of F4/80+ CD11c\u2212Ly6G\u2212 double-negative (DN) cells (presumably inflammatory monocytes) from LHs of PCN- or PBS-dosed but not infected mice (Figure 5B). Next, we investigated which of these cell subsets were better in killing MRSA. As expected, PCN-CD11c+ cells were more efficient than DN cells in killing bacteria in vitro (killing efficacy of CD11c+ cells, approximately 80%; DN cells, approximately 35%; Figure 5B). Interestingly, no difference in bacterial killing was observed between CD11c+ and DN cells isolated from not infected PBS-dosed mice, and either of these cells killed only approximately 30% of bacteria. In the following experiment, we isolated Ly6G+ and Ly6G\u2212 cells from the lungs of PCN- or PBS-dosed mice that, 2.5 hours earlier, were infected with erythromycin-sensitive MRSA. Similarly, when lung Ly6G+ neutrophils and Ly6G\u2212 cells isolated from erythromycin-MRSA\u2013infected PCN- or PBS-dosed mice were examined for their ability to kill WT MRSA, both of these cell subsets from PCN-dosed mice were more effective in killing bacteria than the respective cell subsets from PBS-dosed mice (Figure 5C). Moreover, Ly6G\u2212 cells were better in killing MRSA than Ly6G+ cells in both experimental groups.",

The BM cells were then incubated with MRSA to determine the efficiency of uptake and killing of bacteria in vitro. After 30 minutes of incubation, BM cells from PCN-dosed mice took up twofold more bacteria than BM cells from PBS-dosed mice (Figure 5D). The rate of internalization was highest when bacteria were opsonized with NMS, although even unopsonized bacteria and bacteria opsonized with heat-inactivated NMS were also internalized and killed by BM cells from PCN-dosed mice (Figure 5, D and E). When compared with the background MRSA levels (bacteria incubated alone and treated with gentamicin), similar numbers of bacteria were retrieved from wells incubated with BM cells from PBS-dosed mice, indicating that, during the 30 minutes of incubation time, BM cells from PBS-dosed mice failed to efficiently take up MRSA (Figure 5D). Interestingly, after 3 hours of incubation, BM cells from PBS-dosed mice killed MRSA, although not as well as BM cells derived from PCN-dosed mice (Figure 5E). During the 3 hours of in vitro incubation, BM cells from PCN-dosed mice killed, on average, two to three times more bacteria than these cells from PBS-dosed mice, and killing of MRSA by BM cells from PCN-dosed mice was enhanced, although not fully dependent, on opsonization by complement (Figure 5E).",

To discriminate which groups of innate cells were responsible for PCN-mediated protection against MRSA, we depleted either Ly6G+ (neutrophils) or CD11c+ cells (macrophages and DCs) from PCN-dosed mice on day \u22123, \u22121, and 0, before MRSA infection. In mice dosed with PCN, depletion of either neutrophils or CD11c+ cells impaired resistance to infection, because the bacterial burdens in the lungs of depleted mice were significantly greater than the burdens in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice treated with isotype control Abs (Figure 6C, P < 0.05). Moreover, in PCN-dosed mice, neutrophil depletion resulted in much higher bacterial numbers than did CD11c+ cell depletion (P < 0.05), indicating the importance of neutrophil function in PCN-induced protection. Depletion of CD11c+ cells from PBS-dosed mice did not affect the lung CFU counts when compared with nondepleted PBS-dosed mice. However, the lungs of PBS-dosed mice depleted of neutrophils showed increases in CFUs when compared with PBS-dosed mice not depleted of neutrophils (P < 0.001), indicating the importance of neutrophils in controlling MRSA, even in the absence of PCN. More important, regardless of whether the groups of mice were undepleted, depleted of neutrophils, or depleted of CD11c+ cells, the PCN-dosed mice were always more resistant to MRSA pneumonia than the PBS-dosed mice.",

Whether the protective CD11c+ cells were recruited monocytes resulting from PCN treatment, PCN-altered resident macrophages, or PCN-altered recruited monocytes remained to be determined. CCR2 is a receptor molecule for MCP-1.52 Consequently, monocytes in CCR2 KO mice are impaired in their ability to infiltrate inflammatory sites and, thus, recruitment of monocytes in response to PCN treatment before MRSA infection should also be compromised. Indeed, numbers of CD11c+ cells were significantly reduced in PCN-dosed CCR2 KO mice both before and 24 hours after MRSA infection when compared with PCN-dosed WT mice (Figure 6D). Also, PCN-dosed CCR2 KO mice were less competent than the PCN-dosed WT mice in clearing MRSA infection (Figure 6D). In this regard, at 24 hours after infection, PCN-dosed CCR2 KO mice showed >10-fold more bacteria in their lungs than PCN-dosed WT mice, indicating that CCR2 signaling played a role in PCN-induced resistance to MRSA. Interestingly, when compared with PBS-dosed WT mice, PBS-dosed CCR2 KO mice showed elevated bacterial burden, but reduced CD11c+ cell numbers, at 24 hours after infection, implicating the role of recruited monocytes in clearance of MRSA infection in these mice as well. All CCR2 KO mice, independent of treatment, survived MRSA infection up to 96 hours, when the study was terminated (see Supplemental Figure S5A at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). This suggested that absence of the CCR2 receptor had no effect on survival of PCN-dosed mice, and even improved the survival of PBS-dosed mice.",

The number of Vybrant+ cells in LHs of PCN-dosed mice 5 hours after MRSA infection was significantly higher when compared with the lungs of PBS-dosed mice (Figure 6E, P < 0.01), indicating that PCN changed the lung environment, resulting in enhanced neutrophil recruitment in response to infection. Consistent with this observation were the findings of both a significant decrease of neutrophil recruitment in PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice (Figure 6F, P < 0.001) and lower effectiveness in clearing MRSA infection (P < 0.05) compared with PCN-dosed WT mice. Moreover, the inability of PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice to recruit neutrophils to MRSA-infected lungs decreased their survival compared with PCN-dosed WT mice. In this regard, the PCN-dosed KO mice started dying by day 4 after infection; and by 5 days after infection, >80% of PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice had succumbed to MRSA infection, whereas all of the PCN-treated WT mice survived through 5 days (see Supplemental Figure S5B at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). More important, when compared with PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice, PBS-dosed CXCR2 KO mice were less effective in clearing MRSA infection, despite the CXCR2-independent recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of PBS-dosed CXCR2 KO mice, but PCN- and PBS-dosed KO mice showed a similar lethality rate. This suggested that CXCR2 signaling was important for PCN-induced protection against lethality from MRSA infection, but not important for the PCN-independent resistance to MRSA pneumonia.",

Interestingly, no difference in bacterial clearance from the lungs was observed between PCN- and PBS-dosed IL-13 KO and PBS-dosed WT mice, but when those three groups of mice were compared with PCN-dosed WT mice, the three groups of mice each had at least 100-fold more bacteria in their lungs (Figure 7A).

PCN-dosed IL-4 KO mice cleared bacteria more efficiently than PCN-dosed IL-13 KO mice, but not nearly as well as PCN-dosed WT mice (data not shown). We also found that CD11c+ cells in PCN-dosed mice produced IL-13 at 2.5 hours after MRSA infection (Figure 7B).

When tested, IL-4 levels were significantly elevated in PCN-dosed undepleted mice, when compared with PBS-dosed mice either depleted or not depleted of CD11c+ cells (Figure 7D).",

Mice dosed with PCN either before or shortly after MRSA infection were protected from mortality and showed up to a millionfold reduction in bacterial burden, when compared with PBS-dosed mice. Remarkably, when mice were treated with a VLP unrelated to PCN, P22, a similar degree of protection and recovery was observed. This suggests that the protective effect induced by either of the VLPs can be attributed to shared physical characteristics, such as repeating protein subunits, and small size, similar to a virus, rather than the origin of the VLP. VLPs, because of their ability to stimulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors on DCs, are effective inducers of innate, and adaptive, immunity.18\u201320,53 Thus, VLPs have been used predominantly for their adjuvant properties19,21 and their ability to deliver either genetically conjugated or chemically fused epitopes for the induction of specific immune responses.25,54 However, their potential role as self-proprietors of immune modulation has not been extensively investigated, and the present data suggest that they could be used in this regard.",

At 6 hours after infection, lung bacterial burden was similar in PCN- and PBS-dosed mice; thus, in PCN-dosed mice, the host response to MRSA caused less lung damage, which is similar to what we found in PCN-dosed mice infected with influenza.14 The more efficient bacterial clearance and abridged lung damage coincided with the greatly reduced lung tissue pathological characteristics, apparent by the lack of congestion and interstitial edema at 20 hours after MRSA infection in the lungs of PCN-dosed, but not PBS-dosed, mice.",

In this regard, PCN-dosed SCID mice showed similar recovery rates and nearly identical reduction of bacterial burden as PCN-dosed WT mice, and depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells even further enhanced PCN-mediated protection (data not shown). Moreover, when depleted of either neutrophils or CD11c+ cells, PCN-dosed mice were less resistant to MRSA pneumonia. However, depletion of neutrophils after PCN administration resulted in the loss of more than two logs of protection and increased mortality of mice, whereas CD11c depletion resulted in the loss of less than a log of protection and had no effect on mouse survival. There is an obvious inconsistency between how efficient CD11c cells from PCN-dosed mice were in killing MRSA in vitro and only a moderate effect that the depletion of these cells had on bacterial burden in PCN-dosed mice in vivo. This discrepancy could be attributed to the overall fewer macrophages in the lungs when compared with neutrophils in PCN-dosed mice. Therefore, although CD11c+ cells appear more efficient in killing MRSA in vitro, neutrophils may have a greater in vivo effect because of their prevalence in the MRSA-infected lung.",

            "text": "Neutrophils are considered the primary line of defense against MRSA infections,49,59 although they are also actively targeted by MRSA to improve its survival within the host.57,60,61 In our experiments, PCN-dosed WT mice showed enhanced neutrophil recruitment, but also a much faster decline in neutrophil numbers in the MRSA-inflamed lung, which presumably prevented extensive tissue damage. However, PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice infected with MRSA showed increased bacterial burden at 24 hours after infection, increased mortality, and a deficiency of neutrophil recruitment when compared with PCN-dosed WT mice. In contrast, CXCR2 KO mice that received PBS had nearly identical numbers of neutrophils as PBS-dosed WT mice. This suggests that, in contrast to PBS-dosed mice, MRSA-induced recruitment of neutrophils in PCN-dosed mice was CXCR2 dependent. Because no difference in bacterial burden was observed between PBS-dosed CXCR2 KO and WT mice at 24 hours after infection, we concluded, in agreement with other studies,57,61 that neutrophils alone are not sufficient in clearing MRSA infection.",

            "text": "Among the CD11c+F4/80+ cells isolated from PCN-dosed MRSA-infected mice, the high ratio of M1 (CD11c+CD206\u2212) to M2 (CD11c+CD206+) cells persisted throughout the disease. In contrast to these mice, most macrophages in MRSA-infected, PBS-dosed mice showed characteristics of M2 cells. It is well described that M1 macrophages are more efficient responders to an acute infection, whereas the long-term stage M2 cells, even though they cause less tissue damage, are also less efficient in killing microbes.62 Furthermore, M2 macrophages can be subdivided into three subclasses (a to c), in which M2a cells develop in the presence of IL-13/IL-4 and lipopolysaccharide enhances the M2b phenotype.63 M2a AMs supported M1 cells and promoted lung defense against Pneumocystis murina.64 Interestingly, induction of IL-13 and IL-4 was observed early after MRSA infection of PCN-dosed, but not PBS-dosed, mice, suggesting that M2 cells in PCN- and PBS-dosed mice can differ in their ability to support M1 cells in response to MRSA infection. Despite the presence of IL-13 in the BALF of MRSA-infected PCN-dosed, but not PBS-dosed, mice, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines remained similar between these mice until 12 hours after infection. After 12 hours of infection and likely as a consequence of disease resolution in PCN-dosed mice, a sudden reduction of proinflammatory cytokines occurred in these mice. The importance of IL-13 in PCN-mediated protection from lethal MRSA pneumonia was indicated by the lack of recovery and disease resolution in PCN-dosed IL-13 KO mice, the increased mortality of these mice, and the realization of only partial protection in PCN-dosed IL-4 KO mice (data not shown). IL-13 causes neutrophil activation and recruitment via induction of IL-8\u2013like chemoattractant on airway epithelium.65,66 The role of IL-13 in pulmonary clearance of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus was reported by Olszewski et al.67 In their hands, IL-13 KO mice showed delayed clearance of bacteria, but when mice were reconstituted with exogenous IL-13, normal clearance was restored. We have determined that CD11c+ cells in PCN-dosed, but not in PBS-dosed, mice are accountable for the production of IL-13, whereas the production of IL-4 was only partially dependent on the presence of CD11c+ cells. Which subsets of PCN-induced CD11c+ cells are involved in IL-13 and/or IL-4 production, and the exact mechanism of IL-13\u2013dependent protection in our model, requires further investigation.",

Our results indicate that improved uptake and killing of MRSA by neutrophils and CD11c+ cells, and possibly cell-independent mechanisms, are involved. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the importance of CD11c+ cells in IL-13\u2013dependent protection from MRSA pneumonia. Our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of host anti-MRSA response in the lung and suggest that VLPs could be a viable means of enhancing these mechanisms.",
