Some of these viruses spread rapidly across the globe and they culminate in high morbidity and mortality. For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus caused a global pandemic in 2003, which resulted in approximately 916 deaths and affected around 30 countries [1]. The most recent outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), which was the largest in the history of the disease, started in December 2013 (a decade after the SARS epidemic) and continued until April 2015 in countries like Southern Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Reports on EVD indicated that there were a total of 15,052 laboratory confirmed cases and 11,169 deaths [2]. Hence, the prompt and unambiguous detection of pathogenic viruses is of critical importance in order to actively control and prevent viral diseases outbreak.",

This is because a plethora of viral genomic sequences from NGS based studies are available in the public domain for unrestricted access by researchers. However, researchers have opined that given the abundant NGS data, the analysis of such data is the most challenging aspect of genomic based viral detection [3]. Thus, this opens up a remarkable opportunity for researchers in the bioinformatics and Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) [4, 5] fields. Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) is an emerging branch of bioinformatics, which involves the use of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques for genomic data analysis and the use of the resultant biological facts to develop system based applications [5].",

Another category of alignment-free methods which was recently developed by researchers is the genome space based methods [13, 14]. The Natural Vector (NV) representation and its different variants are representative examples of genome space alignment-free methods [13, 15, 16].

The twenty six viral strains belong to four pathogenic viral species (namely - Enterovirus, Dengue, HepatitisC and Ebola), which are currently attracting global attentions due to their causation of deadly diseases [5]. Different configurations of the na\u00efve Bayes classifier were trained and validated with the ZCGCC. Na\u00efve Bayes classifier was selected for this study because of its attractive physiognomies, which have been widely explored for accurate classification of genomic sequences [7].",

The extracted strains belong to four pathogenic viral species namely the Ebolavirus, Dengue virus, Hepatitis C and Enterovirus D68, which have been largely responsible for epidemic disease outbreak. The available strains for each of these species are selected for the study at hand to achieve an elaborate and more robust classification than the study in [5]. The distribution of the extracted data presents a challenge known as imbalance dataset, which is addressed with the random oversampling strategy in this study. Furthermore, there are high variations in sequence length even for samples that belong to the same viral strain. For example, the number of sequences for the Ebola Zaire strain varies from 22 to 19,897 while EnterovirusH varies from 20 to 7,374. These huge differences in the length of nucleotides within the same viral strain clearly illustrate the reason why alignment based and some existing alignment free methods cannot offer accurate viral detection [17]. Thus, this provides the rationale for an investigation of a DSP technique in the current study. In total, 1,948 samples of viral strains were extracted. Since each of the viral strains represent a class in the dataset, our experimentation dataset consequently contains twenty six different classes.",

The complex cepstrum is a combination of the real and imaginary cepstrum as shown in Eq. (8). The real cepstrum is the log magnitude spectrum of each of the respective signals while the imaginary cepstrum is the phase components. The spectral envelope and spectral details are captured in the real cepstrum. It should be noted that the word \u201ccepstrum\u201d was coined by reversing the first syllable of \u201cspectrum\u201d. Hence, in the cepstrum domain, quefrency also stands for frequency and lifter is used in place of filter [22]. The spectral envelope is the low quefrency components while the spectral details are the high quefrency components in the cepstrum domain. Authors in other DSP application domains have reported that the first 15 or 20 coefficients of a cepstrum appositely represent the spectral envelope [24]. As depicted with the fifth block of Fig. 1, the first 15 or 20 coefficients (spectral envelope) of the real cepstrum are liftered using the window:9\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ w[n] = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {1,\\,\\,\\,0\\, \\le \\,n\\, \\le \\,L} \\\\ {0,\\,\\,\\,elsewhere} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$\\end{document}where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ L $$\\end{document} is the cut off length of the liftering window, which can be either 15 or 20 as earlier stated.

In the first experiment, the na\u00efve Bayes classifier was trained with the ZCGCC extracted from the imbalance dataset. In the second experiments, random oversampling was applied to obtain a balanced dataset. The random oversampling strategy involves the addition of instances to the minority class in a random manner [25]. Since the highest number of instances for any class in the dataset is 100 (Table 1), we increased the number of instances for all the minority classes (instances < 100) in the dataset to 100 to obtain the balanced dataset. The ZCGCC feature vectors extracted from the balanced dataset were further used to train the na\u00efve Bayes classifier. The third experiment involved the comparison of the variant of ZCGCC that gave the best result in the second experiment using the balanced dataset with two other alignment free methods in the literature, namely, Electron Ion Interaction Pseudopotential \u2013 Genomic Cepstral Coefficient (EIIP-GCC) [5] and Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) [26].\n",

The sixty element ZCGCC gave superior performance to the EIIP-GCC and comparable performance to FCGR. However, ZCGCC provides remarkable advantages such as low dimension, global genome analysis and low computational requirements, which make it a promising method for developing diagnostic tool for detection of pathogenic viral diseases. Future works will include an investigation of the ZCGCC for the detection of other organisms in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic domains of life. We also hope to experiment with other machine learning methods to investigate the possibility of improved performance.",
