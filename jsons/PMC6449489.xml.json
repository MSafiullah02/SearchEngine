            "text": "Newborn piglets in the initial period of life are exposed to various microbes colonizing their external environment [1]. The high mortality of piglets during this period is most often linked to diarrhea caused by infections with enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., rotaviruses, coronaviruses, and protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium [2]. During this period, the immune potential of piglets to infections is primarily built up by means of passive immunization involving the colostrum, which contains immunoglobulins [3]. In addition to antibodies, the colostrum of sows contains other substances that affect the development of the immune system of piglets and exert an immunomodulatory effect [4]. These include cytokines, which are involved in systemic defense processes through induction of a Th1 or Th2 immune response, dependent on the infectious agent [5]. These proteins have been shown to exert a local effect on the intestinal mucosa and to penetrate the circulatory system, affecting colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of piglets by commensal microbiota at a later stage of life [6]. Colostrum quality and passive protection potential in neonates can be improved by using immunomodulatory compounds, including probiotics, in the diet of sows during colostrogenesis and lactation [7, 8]. Feed supplementation with probiotics has been shown to affect the gut microflora in sows [8] and to influence the composition of colostrum and milk [9, 10]. The beneficial effect of probiotic bacteria on host defense mechanisms involves regulation of the composition of gut microflora [11]), stimulation of humoral immune response mechanisms [12], and maintenance of homeostasis in the body by ensuring a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [13]. Rautava et al. [9] demonstrated that the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus as a dietary supplement in women promotes production of TGF-\u03b2, which affects IgA synthesis in milk. Jang et al. [14] showed that the use of probiotics as feed additives for sows stimulates IgG synthesis and increases the concentration of this immunoglobulin in the colostrum and in the serum of piglets. A positive effect of probiotics on growth, metabolism, and nutrient digestibility in weaning piglets and grower-finisher pigs has been reported as well [15, 16]. From an economic perspective, what is most important is the beneficial effect of probiotics on performance indicators, including increased litter size, litter weight, the quantity of milk produced, and the quality of its composition [17\u201319].",

            "text": "Previously published research has shown that probiotics induce production of Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines while at the same time increasing synthesis of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, which have anti-inflammatory functions [34]. Such an effect is confirmed by the results of our experiment, in which the use of Bokashi in sows during pregnancy was followed by an increase in the concentration of Th1 cytokines, i.e., IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3, and Th2 cytokines, i.e., IL-4, IL-10 and the immunoregulatory TGF-\u03b2. Dahan et al. [35] and Dalmasso et al. [36] showed that the use of Streptococcus boulardii as a dietary supplement in humans inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in response to infection. The use of S. boulardii protects cells in the infection process by inhibiting signal pathways of transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is responsible for inducing expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, and of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), thereby reducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, S. boulardii exerts a unique effect on inflammation through a specific alteration of the migratory behavior of T cells, which accumulate in mesenteric lymph nodes; therefore, S boulardii treatment limits infiltration of T helper 1 cells and the inflammatory process. Our observations are consistent with the results of a study by Zhang et al. [37], which demonstrated that Lactobacillus rhamnosus used in pigs affects pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by regulating their systemic production. Changes in the concentrations of cytokines secreted by Th1 or Th2 cells are associated with altered proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, with no change in the function of these cells. The high percentage of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines shown in our study in the serum of pregnant sows indicates that Bokashi preparation have an immunomodulatory effect on systemic immune processes, manifested in part as improvement in the immunological quality of the colostrum. This is also confirmed by research published by Bailey et al. [38] and Scharek et al. [12], who showed a high percentage of CD25+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria of pigs whose feed was supplemented with Bacillus cereus. These observations indicate stimulation of an immune response associated with the development of the GALT system and the activation of regulatory T cells. On the other hand, Schierack et al. [39] showed that in sows that did not receive probiotics, the relative numbers of CD21+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells decreased, whereas supplementation of feed with Bacillus cereus during pregnancy mainly stimulated the subpopulation of CD21+ lymphocytes in blood samples. It should therefore be assumed that stimulation of lymphocyte subpopulations by the specific bacterial antigens contained in Bokashi preparation enhances their proliferation and stimulates the production of regulatory cytokines circulating in the peripheral blood and entering the colostrum and milk. These phenomena improve the function of the sow immune system, protecting the developing fetuses and increasing the immune potential of the colostrum and milk. The stimulatory function of Bokashi preparation is also confirmed by the high serum IgG and IgA antibody concentrations in the sows on day 114 of gestation and in the colostrum and milk in the postpartum period. Assuming that 40% of the IgA and 100% of the IgG present in colostrum originates in the serum of the sow [40], it can be concluded that the high concentrations of these immunoglobulins in the experimental group will enhance passive protection of the piglets against infections in the first few days after birth [40, 41].",

Among the cytokines released, IL-2 is particularly important. Its effect is manifested as stimulation of the growth of B and T lymphocytes and NK cells and activation of innate immune response mechanisms [44]. In our study, in the group of sows receiving Bokashi preparation, during the entire experimental period, lower concentrations of this cytokine were found in the colostrum and milk as compared to the control. The slight increase in the IL-2 concentration in the milk in the experimental and control groups between 24 and 72 h postpartum may have been due to infection of the mammary gland with bacteria from the animals\u2019 living environment, but is not associated with inflammatory processes in the mammary gland, as clinical examination showed no pathological changes in the mammary gland of the sows (no changes in milk secretion, increase in the temperature of the tissues in the area, redness, swelling, or soreness). In the colostrum of sows receiving Bokashi preparation and in the milk up to 120 h postpartum, a lower IFN-\u03b3 level was also observed in comparison with the control. The most likely reason for this is the high concentration of Th2 cytokines, which inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The high concentrations of this cytokine in the control group suggest the promotion of a cell-mediated immune response dependent on stimulation of CD4+ lymphocytes. The results of the study confirm that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits proliferation and activity of Th2 cells and cytokine synthesis by these cells by promoting the pro-inflammatory nature of the immune response. The increasing concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 shown in the milk in both groups show that this cytokine plays an important role during lactation by taking part in immune protection of the mammary gland through activation of macrophage phagocytosis or stimulation of cytotoxic (Tc) lymphocytes [43].",

TNF-\u03b1 present in colostrum and milk is secreted by macrophages and the mammary epithelium [45, 46], and a high concentration of this cytokine stimulates development of the mammary gland during colostrogenesis. The TNF-\u03b1 contained in colostrum and milk has also been shown to inhibit local inflammation of the mammary gland during lactation [47]. The increase in the TNF-\u03b1 concentration in the experimental group indicates the promotion of cellular immune response mechanisms through enhancement of Th1 lymphocyte activity, which has also been demonstrated in the case of probiotics containing strains of Leuconostoc spp. and Streptococcus spp. [48]. The high concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in the colostrum after application of Bokashi preparation may be due to stimulation of systemic immune mechanisms, mainly monocyte and macrophage phagocytosis, by providing the organism with bacterial antigens contained in the probiotic. Stimulation of phagocytosis by TNF-\u03b1 may result in the release of IL-6 from macrophages, which were present in high concentrations in the colostrum and milk of sows receiving Bokashi preparation. Similar results have been obtained by Blumer et al. [32] who reported high TNF-\u03b1 expression in the placenta of pregnant mice whose feed was supplemented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). These observations indicate that probiotics induce pro-inflammatory signals activating the cytotoxicity of cells involved in protection against infection. This was confirmed in our study by the increase in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in the colostrum and milk of sows receiving Bokashi preparation in correlation with high serum concentrations of these cytokines.",

IL-6 also influences differentiation of CD4+ T lymphocytes towards the Th2 phenotype and secretion of cytokines, mainly IL-4 [50]. This process is associated with impairment of Th1 cell differentiation, but does not directly affect Th2 cells. The high IL-6 concentration in colostrum in conjunction with the high IL-4 concentration in the experimental group suggests that the use of Bokashi preparation influences the differentiation of T lymphocytes towards production of Th2 cytokines. The anti-inflammatory effect of IL-6 consisted in stimulation of IL-10 synthesis, as demonstrated in the experiment. The high concentration of IL-10 in the colostrum of sows receiving Bokashi preparation shows that IL-6 is involved in modulating the immune response and maintaining a balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokine synthesis. Saito et al. [51] showed that IL-6 is also closely linked to local production of IgA in the mammary gland.

The higher concentration of IgA antibodies in the colostrum and milk is important in the context of preventing antigen adhesion to enterocytes in the intestines of the piglets and reducing the risk of infection and death [58]. Similarly, the higher serum IgA concentration noted in the sows in our study indicates more effective immune protection of the pregnant female.",

            "text": "In addition to its nutritional value, colostrum is an important source of immunoglobulins ensuring passive protection for sucklings. The IgG and IgA antibodies in colostrum are involved in systemic and local defense processes in the first days of life of piglets until the GALT system is activated [59]. The results of our study indicate that the use of Bokashi preparation in sows enhances the immune potential of the colostrum by increasing the concentrations of IgG and IgA. Similar results were obtained by Vitini et al. [60] and Valeur et al. [61], who demonstrated an increase in IgA concentration in the intestinal mucosa of pigs following dietary supplementation with Bifidobacterium longum and S. boulardii, which influence the systemic immune response. The immunopotentiation demonstrated in the present study should be considered to be linked to activation by the probiotics of B lymphocyte subpopulations and Th2 cytokines, mainly IL-4, which enter the body fluids, including colostrum and milk [62, 63]. A high concentration of immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk ensures piglets passive humoral immunity through antigen agglutination, neutralization of viruses and bacterial toxins, and prevention of bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells, and protects the mammary gland against infection through antigen binding and participation in immune processes.",

The low concentration of IL-2 in the absence of differences in IFN-\u03b3 concentrations between the experimental and control groups confirms the anti-inflammatory effect of Bokashi preparation on pigs. The induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, mainly IL-10, noted in the colostrum PMCs may be linked to the \u2018bystander suppression\u2019 process, which leads to suppression of the pro-inflammatory response by reducing dendritic cell activation [64]. This phenomenon and the accompanying down-regulation of TNF\u03b1 show that the use of Bokashi preparation in pig diets ensure a balance between the Th1 and Th2 response in the body [64, 65].",

For example, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bacillus lactis have been shown to increase the concentration of immunoglobulins and cytokines in milk, although probiotics based on B. lactis alone have a more favorable effect on this process [33]. Significant differences in the properties of probiotic strains were recently demonstrated by Bottcher et al. [53] who showed that dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in a decrease in the TGF-\u03b22 concentration in human milk without affecting the concentration of IgA, TGF-\u03b21, and other cytokines. In this context, the use of Bokashi preparation as feed additives for pigs seems to be beneficial, as it is composed of a variety of microbes acting synergistically, which ensures an increase in the immune potential of colostrum through simultaneous stimulation of the Th1 and Th2 responses.",

            "text": "It is worth emphasizing that the use of Bokashi preparation during pregnancy and lactation had a positive effect on the health of the sows. During the experiment, sow body weight at parturition was higher and weight loss during the first 7 days of lactation was lower. No significant differences were noted in feed consumption between the sows in the control and experimental groups. Mori et al. [66] and Klingspor et al. [67] showed that probiotics increase the capacity for nutrient absorption by the intestinal mucosa in pigs, while Alexopoulos et al. [19] found that these substances increase serum levels of certain nutrients, such as cholesterol and fats. The results of these studies together with those obtained in our experiment suggest that the use of Bokashi preparation in sows may improve the digestibility of dietary nutrients owing to the increased production and activity of digestive enzymes in the gut induced by the microbial strains contained in the supplement. These processes enhance digestive processes in the gut. Furthermore, the use of EM Bokashi improved the apparent total tract digestibility of nitrogen and energy, which requires further study. Better utilization of nutrients during pregnancy and lactation directly affects colostrum and milk quality, which is confirmed by the results of the study. The high immune status of the colostrum and milk of the sows whose diet was supplemented with Bokashi preparation significantly reduced piglet mortality in the first 7 days of life and the percentage of piglets with symptoms of diarrhea. Effective protection of the intestines against infection by diarrhea-inducing pathogens, owing to high levels of immunoglobulins and cytokines in the colostrum, leads to better performance results and reduces financial losses on pig farms [19, 68, 69].",

Early exposure of the female to probiotic microorganisms has proven to have a significant effect on the programming of the neonatal immune system [71]. Studies on humans have shown that the use of probiotics during pregnancy affects the composition of the colostrum and milk, protecting the offspring against the development of allergic diseases [72, 73]. Similarly, animal studies have shown that supplementation of feed with probiotics during pregnancy inhibits the development of respiratory disease in the offspring, which is evidence of their immunomodulatory effect on the fetus [74, 75]. We observed a similar effect after using Bokashi preparation in the diet of pregnant sows. The use of Bokashi preparation as feed additives also resulted in increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which increase the protective capacity of the colostrum by stimulating cellular immune mechanisms protecting the mother and neonates against infection. At the same time, the increased concentrations of cytokines IL-4, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and of immunoglobulins in the colostrum and milk from sows in the experimental group demonstrate the immunoregulatory effect of Bokashi preparation on Th2 cells and may lead to increased expression of regulatory T cells and polarization of the immune response from Th1 to Th2.",
