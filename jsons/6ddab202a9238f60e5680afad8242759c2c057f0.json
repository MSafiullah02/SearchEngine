These complaints may result from medical treatments and procedures, or may secondarily complicate the management and patient compliance of treatment for other medical issues. Therefore, it is important that clinicians treating females obtain basic information regarding human sexual function and dysfunction. This chapter presents an integration of the clinical research as well as the author's experience regarding sexual function and the management of sexual problems often presented in an obstetricgynecology practice.",

Each phase interacts with and infl uences the presence or absence of the other, and does not necessarily proceed in a linear fashion. Each is affected by psychological, sociological, and relational processes. However, natural sexual function throughout the whole sexual response cycle is physiologically dependent on adequate hormone levels-particularly estrogen and testosterone, enzymes that convert precursor hormones to the above-mentioned hormones, nonhormonal neurotransmitters like dopamine, adequate blood supply, and adequate central and peripheral nerve conduction. The clinician who assesses all of the physiologic and nonphysiologic areas, when presented with a patient with sexual dysfunction, will obtain a better diagnosis and treatment plan.",

Milky, prostatic-like fl uid from the paraurethral gland either emitted out of urethra or present in the bladder or urethra poststimulation women with strong vaginal and uterine muscle strength will ejaculate the milky prostatic-type fl uid that is already present in the arousal phase, from the urethra during orgasm. When not ejaculated externally, this fl uid can be found in the bladder poststimulation. The clitoris is probably the most reliable source of stimulation for female orgasm, although some women report a preference and facility for orgasms mediated primarily by vaginal or cervical stimulation. Even women with complete spinal cord injuries have reported laboratory-documented orgasms. The G-spot (an area felt through the anterior wall of the vagina, halfway between the back of the pubic symphysis and cervix, along the urethra) is a common site of intravaginal orgasmic stimulation. If a patient is unsure as to whether she has ever experienced orgasm, preorgasmic sensations may be described as a wave of pleasure that extends over her pelvic area much like the sensation of going over a roller coaster hill followed by the sensation of vaginal contractions and then a feeling of satisfaction. Intense orgasm can be compared to the sudden pleasure and intensity of a sneeze, usually accompanied by a throbbing sensation in the vagina. The vaginal sensations of less intense orgasms feel more like a ripple than an intense series of contractions. Table 20 .2 lists the typical physiologic reactions during the orgasm phase. Orgasm contractions usually last from 3-5 seconds and will be followed either by a sense of physiologic satisfaction (especially in the case of an intense orgasm) or by an urge to continue the stimulation (possibly resulting in more orgasms). When orgasm occurs in a very positive context, the woman often has subjective feelings of satisfaction and/or emotional bonding toward her partner. However, these positive feelings can also result without experiencing the orgasm phase of sexual response, a phenomenon that is diffi cult for many men to relate to. 1. 0.8 second contractions of the vaginal canal 2.

Another type involves a failure to mentally perceive sexual stimulation as arousing or pleasurable despite adequate physiologic indications. In a study of the general population, around 20% of women complained either of unpleasurable sex or diffi culty with lubrication. Vaginal lubrication and elasticity are highly dependent on estrogen. Likewise, lubrication is dependent indirectly on cholinergic transmitter activity. External genital vasocongestion is also dependent on nonadrenergic/ noncholinergic neurotransmitters like nitric oxide synthetase and polypeptides, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide. Therefore estrogen levels and a review of medications that might interfere with transmitter action are warranted. Also, the conditions or medications that affect sexual desire or orgasmic capacity can affect arousal through a negative feedback loop. In other words, if a woman does not desire to be sexually active because of a testosterone defi ciency, she may comply with her partner's initiations but fail to lubricate because of disinterest. There are drugs and conditions believed to inhibit arousal directly and they are listed in Tables 20.7 and 20.8, respectively.",

The inability to ejaculate within 5-10 minutes (when a man is not intentionally suppressing this refl ex to please his partner) can be considered dysfunctional. As with female orgasmic dysfunction this defi nition is subjectively defi ned by the couple, and especially the man's subjective sense of a failure to progress to orgasm. When the man has no diffi culty ejaculating with noncoital stimulation, the problem is assumed to be psychogenic and referral to a sex therapist is appropriate. However, diseases such as diabetes and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (antidepressants) are often associated with this symptom and referral to an internist or urologist is recommended.

Well-researched neurologic tools for genital sensitivity are needed as well as greater understanding of hormonal and other neurochemical mediators.

Therefore the recommendations given below may change greatly over the next few years. ",

Androgen defi ciency is emerging as a likely medical cause of this disorder, especially if the patient is well estrogenized. A woman with insuffi cient androgens will give a history of persistent absent or almost absent sexual drive for partnered sex, masturbation, and erotica, and few if any sexual dreams. Additionally, she may complain of a persistent unexplained fatigue, lowered mood, and decreased sexual receptivity, orgasm, and pleasure. Recommended laboratory screening for low sex drive is presented in 1. Do you feel depressed? (A negative reply does not necessarily rule out depression) 2. Is your sleep disrupted in any way, such as diffi culty getting to sleep within 10-15 minutes, waking during the night with diffi culty getting back to sleep easily, awakening 1-2 hours earlier than you need or want to? 3. Has your appetite greatly increased or decreased? 4. Has your weight fl uctuated more than 10 pounds without effort on your part (not due to smoking cessation)? 5. Do you experience constipation? Diarrhea? 6. Has your drive for sex been lowered under all circumstances? 7. Has your energy decreased a lot? 8. Has your concentration decreased a lot? 9.

Treatment for most physical causes of low sex drive listed in the tables is well documented. However, treatment recommendations for androgen insuffi ciency are just emerging and thus it will be discussed in detail here. It has been suggested that because testosterone assays are not sensitive at lower levels of female normal ranges, a free testosterone level in the lower quartile of the normal range accompanied by symptoms of testosterone defi ciency warrants a trial of replacement therapy. Ironically, because oral contraceptives lower free testosterone, replacing them with nonhormonal methods may be all that is needed in some women. Likewise, women on oral forms of estrogen (replacement) therapy should switch to a transdermal approach, which does not bind free testosterone except at high doses. If sexual symptoms persist 6-12 weeks after these medication changes, laboratory tests should be repeated to rule out continued androgen defi ciency. Options for androgen replacement therapy are presented in Table 20 .22.",

Scientifi cally based knowledge is essential in effective management and collaboration with related specialists is often warranted. Women's sexual medicine suffers from a lack of adequate diagnostic techniques, laboratory tests, and treatment norms. Some treatment regimens, especially androgen replacement therapy, are still considered experimental and lack well-done studies with long-term safety data to back up clinical experience. However, research in this area is rapidly increasing and clinicians are encouraged to obtain further training by attending meetings hosted by the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists-AASECT (www.aasect.org), The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health-ISSWSH (www.isswsh.org), The Society for Sex Therapy and Research-SSTAR (www.sstarnet.org), and The Society for the Scientifi c Study of Sexuality-SSSS (www.sexualscience.org). Furthermore, by joining these organizations, the clinician will also have access to publications and Web-based case discussion groups. Those with a special interest in treating female sexual dysfunction are encouraged to obtain certifi cation from The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists. When done with up-to-date, scientifi cally based information, obstetricgynecologic clinicians can play an educational and therapeutic role in the lives",
