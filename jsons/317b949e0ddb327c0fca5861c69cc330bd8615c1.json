In keeping with serological tests for SARS-CoV-1, those for SARS-CoV-2 appear to be highly specific and sensitivewith reported specificities of up to 100% 1,2 . This high specificity means that the test could reliably confirm that an individual has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The available evidence suggests that these individuals will be immune to reinfection for at least the short to medium term 3 . Although sample sizes were small, detailed serological studies in infected persons indicate that all infected persons develop high levels of neutralizing antibodies from around the 14 th day after symptom onset 3, 4 . The level of antibodies produced did not vary between those with minimal and severe symptoms 3 . Around 80% of those infected and who develop symptoms only experience mild symptoms 5 . At least 30% of infected persons will not develop any symptoms at all 6 .",

In many countries nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) diagnostic testing was limited due to supply and other constraints. In Belgium, for example, contacts of COVID-19 patients including Health Care workers with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections without fever were not eligible for NAAT testing 7 . Studies from Page 3 of 5 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 elsewhere indicate that a considerable proportion of those exposed, such as health care workers would be infected 5 . These could be detected via serological testing and they could be safely released from home confinement (as is the practice in many countries currently) and prioritized for return to work. This would have a number of benefits. A considerably larger number of persons would become aware of the fact that they had been infected with minimal or no symptoms, which could reduce the fear associated with COVID-19. Those testing positive would be able to return to work which would assist with economic recovery. In the health care, and related sectors such as care-of-the-elderly facilities, recovered individuals could be favored for patient contact which would reduce transmission between health care workers and patients.",
