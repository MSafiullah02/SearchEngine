Reaction of 1b with Boc-Tle-OH [25]\n6 using EDC catalysed by DMAP in THF afforded protected ester 7a in satisfactory yield after chromatography. We later found that DMF was a superior solvent, especially for 1b, and performed well on scale-up, delivering a 90% yield of 7a. Deprotection was very conveniently achieved by treatment of 7a with HCl-dioxane, as the HCl salt RM5061 8a of the product could be crystallised directly from the reaction medium and was obtained in excellent yield. Importantly, RM5061 8a showed no appreciable hydrolysis after standing at 20 \u00b0C for three months (<1% of 1b seen by NMR analysis and by HPLC); its aqueous solubility was approximately 5 mg/mL [16]. It was of paramount importance to assay the chiral purity of RM5061 8a; for comparison, valacyclovir is typically obtained from acyclovir in about 92% e.e. [26]. From Boc-Tle-OH (S-enantiomer), using DMF as solvent, RM5061 8a was obtained in 99% purity by HPLC and the e.e. was 99.8%. Starting from the corresponding derivative of D-tert-leucine, by chiral HPLC analysis the e. e. of ent-\n8a was determined to be 99.5%.",

It was recently re-purposed as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent in the treatment of viral acute respiratory infections. Phase III clinical trials carried out in 2865 adults and adolescents with uncomplicated influenza A and B showed that the drug reduced the duration of the influenza illness when compared to placebo with a p value < 0.05. Additionally the studies showed that nitazoxanide compared to placebo was effective in the treatment of the common cold caused by rhinovirus and coronavirus. Further studies in patients with viral respiratory infections at risk of developing complications, children, and adults and children with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are currently underway. It was important to identify new derivatives with better systemic absorption, and we have now shown that RM-5061 8a is a second prodrug for tizoxanide 1b. RM5061 8a is more soluble and better absorbed in laboratory animals than 1a and is now undergoing Phase I clinical trials.
