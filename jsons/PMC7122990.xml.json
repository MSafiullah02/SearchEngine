These \u201creplication organelles\u201d have been studied in lots of detail over the last few decades, generating a wealth of exciting information with respect to their composition, morphology, and functioning during the viral life cycle. Unfortunately one of the most, and perhaps unintentionally, overlooked areas is the real-time spatiotemporal dynamic behavior of the formation and functioning of the replicative structures themselves but also the individual (membranous) associated components in living cells.",

            "text": "To study the dynamic processes underlying the formation and functioning of the CoV replicative structures and/or replication-associated proteins, one needs noninvasive means to visualize them in living cells. Recombinant CoVs expressing replicase proteins fused to fluorescent proteins (FPs) serve as an excellent tool to perform such real-time imaging studies in their native environment. Alternatively, these fluorescent fusion proteins may be expressed upon transfection of expression plasmids prior to infection, if desirable in combination with plasmids expressing host proteins fused to FPs. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) several live-cell imaging techniques can be employed to investigate the real-time kinetics of the replicative structures and its associated components. Once cells are infected with the recombinant FP-expressing CoVs, one can simply follow the fate of the replicative structures or its components over time, either under native or perturbed conditions, resulting in valuable spatiotemporal information with respect to the formation and behavior of the replicative structures and its associated components (see Fig. 1 for an example of a time-lapse experiment of MHV-nsp2GFP-infected LR7 cells). Alternatively, a (part of the) pool of FPs may be selectively and irreversibly photobleached and the temporal fate of the remaining non-bleached proteins may be followed [reviewed in [17\u201319]]. From the latter measurements parameters can be extracted, which among others reflect (the lack of) mobility [fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)] or the (dis)continuity between different membrane compartments [fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP)]. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the principles of the FRAP and FLIP approaches, respectively, with typical fluorescence intensity graphs that can be obtained from these type of live-cell imaging experiments depicted in Fig. 4.\n\n\n\n",

If not, HEPES-buffered culture medium can be used during image acquisition. Both approaches have successfully been used in our laboratory.Imaging at a high magnification of individual cells is preferable when performing time-lapse imaging of CoV replicative structures; the authors recommend using an oil immersion 40\u00d7/1.3NA or 63\u00d7/1.4NA objective.Use the range indicator function of the confocal microscope to avoid imaging of oversaturated pixels, as data sets containing oversaturated pixels cannot be used for quantitative data analysis.Opening the pinhole completely is important to ensure that the maximum amount of light emitted from the fluophores is collected and not only from a single focal plane.When applying a single photobleach event of 100 % laser power, corresponding to the wavelength of the FP, does not result in a fluorescent intensity drop to background levels, the number of iterations should be increased. Once the recovery of the fluorescence in the bleached area reaches a plateau the acquisition of additional frames can be stopped.During FLIP experiments the cell of interest is repeatedly photobleached at a high intensity laser power and therefore at least one control cell, i.e., a cell that is not photobleached, should be in the field of view to monitor whether loss of fluorescence is due to diffusion of the FPs and not due to photobleaching of the cell.Correction for unwanted photobleaching is performed by using the fluorescent intensity (fluctuations) of the whole cell during the FRAP experiment. Such a control is not possible when performing FLIP as the loss of fluorescence is measured. Instead, the background-subtracted fluorescence of a whole non-bleached cell, which has been fitted to the equation \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ y(t)= \\exp \\kern0.24em \\left(-t/x\\right) $$\n\\end{document}y(t)=exp(\u2212t/x), should be used for correction.
