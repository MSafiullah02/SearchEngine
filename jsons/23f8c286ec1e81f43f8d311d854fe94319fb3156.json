India including many Asian countries stands to be a gallery of many medicinal plant variety resources (Dhawale and Ghyare 2016) because of their ancient, prosperous, and the most distinct cultural backgrounds related to the use of such plants. Among such highly important herbs, Ocimum ranks first because of its wide range of health-promoting benefits and sanative properties in traditional as well as in the modern pharmacological system (Bhasin 2012 ) and hence is regarded as royal herb (Sharma 2010) or a queen of herbs (Kayastha et al. 2014) . Ocimum is an omnipresent herb which belongs to the family lamiaceae, and this whole genus corresponds to the common name, 'basil.' The genus Ocimum is highly variable and possesses wide genetic diversity at intra-and inter-species levels (Upadhyay et al. 2015) . It includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs having diverse essential oils of tremendous palliative importance which finds its applications in pharmaceutical, modern perfumery, and food processing industry.",

All the species of Ocimum are economically and medicinally important. These plants have been extensively used in systems of traditional medicine across the world, primarily in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine. Various parts of the plant have been consumed as a home remedy to cure many diseases since ages. According to Ayurveda, basil leaves are very good expectorant to relief cough and cold as well as are also used to treat digestive disorder. It is also beneficial in soothing itchy and irritated eyes (Brien 2009 ). In Chinese traditional medicine, basil leaves are resorted to relief the irritation caused due to insect bites (Brien 2009 ). These 5000-year-old methods of treatment are not just hearsay but are being supported by modern research. It has been demonstrated by the recent scientific research that constituents of basil essential oil acquire strong anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiviral, properties (Bhattacharyya 2013) . Hence, basil can be venerated as God's recipe for the elixir of life.",

            "text": "According to recent findings, it is suggested that some very high-value secondary metabolites such as geraniol, linalool, linalyl, camphor, citral, methyl eugenol, eugenol, methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, urosolic acid, safrol, thymol, taxol can be obtained from different plant parts which may prove to be a basis for generation of new drugs (Khare 2007) . The mentioned metabolites are of great importance in medicine, aroma, and cosmetic trade. Despite its incomparable importance in the traditional system of medicine and huge repository of phytochemicals, our understanding behind the molecular aspect of this medicinal plant is still limiting. Recently, a comparative transcriptome study between O. basilicum and O. sanctum was published (Rastogi et al. 2014 ) wherein many transcripts of phenylpropanoids in O. basilicum and of terpenoid biosynthesis in O. sanctum were recorded. Again to decipher the complete metabolic routes and the aspects affecting the regulation and the channeling of these pathways, complete chloroplastic and nuclear genomes were sequenced for the first, after obtaining the sequencing data from three NGS platforms using four libraries (Rastogi et al. 2015) . This report was the first step to unveil the secrets of its therapeutic potential with the scientific validation to the traditional claims of its utility in diverse medicinal usage and hence can be served as a milestone work for the identification of unidentified genes involving in the downstream biochemical pathway of medically significant metabolite. Figure 10 .1 shows the pathways attributed to the proteins predicted from scaffolds of O. tenuiflorum genome as predicted by KAAS server in the study by Rastogi et al. (2015) considering Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana as reference organisms. Of the total annotated proteins, only 2.53% belonged to the category 'Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites' while 2.83% to the 'Metabolism of Terpenoids and polyketides.' In order to identify the key genes behind the strong medicinal properties of (Upadhyay et al. 2015) also reported the draft genome of tulsi using Illumina HiSeq 1000 platform. Figure 10 .2 shows the top ten species that from which the predicted genes were annotated against all Viridiplantae clade genes in the Uni-Prot database. Most annotations were made from the Genlisea aurea (order-Lamiales and family-Lentibulariaceae), i.e., 30,983 hits out of the total 53,480 annotated genes in UniProt. G. aurea is a carnivorous plant which is reported to be the plant with smallest known genome of size 63.6 Mb among the higher plants (Leushkin et al. 2013 Rastogi et al. (2015) and Upadhyay et al. (2015) are an important achievement in discovering the specialized plant metabolites of immense medicinal interest, glorifying the sacredness of the 'holy tulsi.' Chloroplasts have a vital function in supporting life on this planet. At present, there is an access to more than 800 chloroplast genomes which are sequenced from a range of land plants leading to expansion of our knowledge in chloroplast biology, gene transfer within the cells, preservation, diversity, and the basis of inheritance as a result of which chloroplast recombinant genes can be engineered for enhancement of agronomical plant traits or production of high-value farming or bio-scientific products. Since the chloroplast genome or the plastome exhibits a uniparental inheritance which is primarily maternal in angiosperms while paternal in gymnosperms, hence the sequence information coded in the chloroplast DNA loci is used in plant systematic for elucidating intraspecific relatedness via deep divergence (Martin et al. 2002; Kugita et al. 2003; Yamane et al. 2003; Ahmed et al. 2012 Ahmed et al. , 2013 . In some plant species, exogenous genes which encode important metabolites have also been transformed into the chloroplast genomes, like the genes for vaccines production effective against human diseases (L\u00f6ssl and Waheed 2011; Waheed et al. 2011a, b) . Particular loci in chloroplast DNA have also been used as barcodes which are helpful in the identification of plant species (Fazekas et al. 2008; Peter et al. 2009 ); however, the hypothesis of a universal barcode has natural precincts (Ahmed et al. 2013) . Whole chloroplast genome sequence is considered to be a super-barcode , but this notion requires reconsideration for outcrossing plant species that are, or have been occupying the same geographical range without loss of identity from interbreeding (sympatric species).",

Use of plant-derived enzyme cocktails from lignocellulosic biomass for the producing fermentable sugars was achieved for the first time by Verma et al. (2010) . In contrast to the single biofuel enzymes which were formerly expressed in chloroplasts, nine discrete genes from heterologous systems (bacteria or fungi) were expressed in tobacco chloroplasts or E. coli by means of a novel method facilitating the introduction of fungal genes with several introns, eradicating the requirement of cDNA library preparation. Enzyme cocktails derived from the chloroplast propose several remarkable benefits like cost effectiveness, enhanced permanence of chloroplast-derived enzymes with no requirement of enzyme purification while the industry-based fermentation systems incorporate high expenditure and low manufacturing capability. Interestingly, b-glucosidase expression was able to release the hormones from conjugates, ensuing improved phytohormone levels and enhanced biomass (Jin et al. 2012) , which was an unpredicted result of enzyme expression.",

When c-tmt gene was overexpressed by engineering it into the chloroplast genome, it was observed that manifold layers were formed in the inner chloroplast envelope. In addition, approximately tenfold high production of a-tocopherol in the seed from c-tocopherol was evident (Jin and Daniell 2014) . Similarly, introduction of lycopene b-cyclase genes into the plastid genome of tomato improved the production of provitamin A (b-carotene) from lycopene, with apparent phenotypic modifications (Apel and Bock 2009) .",

            "text": "For more than a decade, genetic engineering of chloroplast mainly focused on the overexpressing potential genes for increasing tolerance against biotic stress, which is imperative to plant defense and improving the yield. Insect pests are a real threat to the yield loss in many countries. Besides cotton bollworm resistance acquired by over-expressing Bt protein in chloroplasts (De Cosa et al. 2001) , there are various other latest and prominent examples of enhanced biotic stress tolerance. Retrocyclin-101 and Protegrin-1 proteins were responsible for defending against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Erwinia soft rot accountable to the yield deficit in a number of cultivated plants (Lee et al. 2011 ). b-glucosidase gene expression leads to the resistance against whitefly and aphid , which induces the liberation of insecticidal sugar esters by conjugating with hormones. Multiple defiances hostile to aphids, lepidopteran insects, whiteflies, and viral and bacterial pathogens were accomplished by expression of the Pinellia ternata agglutinin (PTA) gene in the genome of chloroplast (Jin et al. 2012) . Edible crops like cabbage (Brassica oleracea) (Liu et al. 2007 ), soybean (Dufourmantel et al. 2004 (Dufourmantel et al. , 2005 , and eggplant (Solanum melongena) ) have been engineered and expressed stably by integrating over 40 transgenes in their chloroplast genomes leading to the improvement in the agronomic traits as well as the acquiring resistance against insects. As per the new strategy, scientists have now started exploring possibilities of downregulating the specific gene(s) of interest. Expressing dsRNAs (double-stranded RNAs) inside the genome of chloroplast to employ RNAi (RNA interference) for acquiring preferred agronomic traits, principally insect resistance in order to check yield loss is one such approach. This is achieved by expression of long or short dsRNAs activating the RNAi leading to the disruption of the target gene(s) in insects, thereby conferring effective protection from insects avoiding the use of harmful pesticide chemicals. This strategy was used by Jin et al. (2015) where they suppressed three vital proteins, namely Chi (lepidopteran chitin synthase), P450 (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase), and V-ATPase required for the survival of the insects by means of introducing dsRNAs in the chloroplast system of tobacco. Each of the double-stranded RNA was discretely expressed in chloroplasts, and leaves were then fed to the insects. The level of transcription in the target genes of Helicoverpa insects was found to be tremendously decreased to almost negligible in the midgut, ensuing considerable drop in the net larval weight as well as in the pupation rate (Jin et al. 2015) . Transplastomic potato plants which produced b-actin and targeted long dsRNA were proved to be lethal to the larvae of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), demonstrating an additional crop protection method .",

            "text": "At this point in time, protein-based drugs are tremendously costly; for instance, insulin (a well-known drug for treating prevalent diabetes disease worldwide) is unaffordable to more than 90 percent of the world population. The excessive price of protein-based drugs is because of their expensive fermentation systems' setup (approximately $450-700 million based on their capacity) (Grabowski et al. 2006; Sp\u00f6k et al. 2008) , exorbitant protein purification cost from the host, the requirement for low temperature storage and transfer, and the brief shelf-life of the ultimate product. Protein-based drugs prepared by plant chloroplasts defeat most of these challenges because there is no requirement of the costly fermentation systems and can easily be synthesized in hydroponic greenhouses approved by FDA (federal drug administration) (Holtz et al. 2015) . Lettuce leaves which express protein drugs can be lyophilized and could be put in storage for an indefinite period at surrounding temperature without the loss in its efficacy (Su et al. 2015) . Protein drugs encapsulated in the plant cell wall remain protected from the enzymes, and acids secreted by the human stomach as the plant cell wall glycans do not get digested by the human secreted enzymes. On the other hand, the microbes in the human gut have progressed in the breaking down each of the glycosidic bond present in the plant cell wall, consequently liberating the protein drug in the lumen of gut, guiding its transport to the immune system or blood (El Kaoutari et al. 2013; Kwon and Daniell 2015) . Mode of oral release of various human curative proteins expressed in chloroplasts is has proven to be an effective medication for treating numerous human ailments, like diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Majority of the proteins for the preliminary testing were expressed in chloroplasts of tobacco followed by their expression in chloroplasts of lettuce for subsequent expansion toward the clinic. Exendin-4 protein regulated the insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent way when delivered orally. Also the drop in glucose levels due to stimulation of insulin production in diabetic animals was observed, and this response was parallel to that generated by an injectable drug (Kwon et al. 2013) . Oral intake of the bioencapsulated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and angiotensin (Ang) (1-7) enzymes leads to the better cardiopulmonary functioning, reduction in the high ventricular systolic blood pressure and recovered the blood flow in the animals with artificially generated pulmonary hypertension (Shenoy et al. 2014) . Plant cell-encapsulated proteins, ACE2 and Ang (1-7), when delivered orally were also found to be reducing endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) and significantly reduced retinal vasculitis and cellular infiltration, and additionally prevented folding and damage in induced autoimmune uveoretinitis animals (Kwon and Daniell 2015) . Nonetheless, when the protein drugs were orally released to the Alzheimer's brain across the blood-brain barrier, it leads to the removal of plaques (Kohli et al. 2014 ). Su et al. (2015) for the first time reported the commercial-scale manufacturing of human blood-clotting factor (up to 30,000 doses for a 20-kg pediatric patient) in a 1000 ft 2 hydroponic cGMP facility. Lyophilized cells of clotting factor made in lettuce were found to last for the span of up to 2 years when stored at normal surrounding temperature, entirely removing the requirement of refrigerated storage. This leads to the advent of industrial level expansion of oral medicine addressing the challenges of high-priced purification, refrigerated storage and shipping, as well as the small shelf-life of the conventional protein drugs. Oral release of wider dose range proved to be efficient in the deterrence of antibody formation in response to clotting factor IX (FIX) injection, therefore making smooth the progress of human clinical studies.",

            "text": "Chloroplasts are the answer to such challenges. One vaccine derived from the chloroplast has been proved to be success granting double immunity against malaria and cholera in animal research (Davoodi-Semiromi et al. 2010 ). Cholera causes a high mortality rate, though there is only one approved vaccine which is not only high-priced but also has very small shelf-life. As far as malaria is concerned, there is no vaccine till date. In order to address this problem, cholera toxin-B subunit (CTB) of Vibrio cholerae was combined with the malarial vaccine antigen apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) for expression in lettuce or tobacco chloroplasts. Due to the unavailability of the human malarial model, the developed chloroplast-expressed CTB was tested by immunizing the mice and was found to be highly efficient. In addition, it also provided the highest duration of defense as per the literature (Davoodi-Semiromi et al. 2010 ). These initial results exhibit that chloroplasts are perfect model for production of inexpensive booster vaccines in counter to numerous contagious diseases (Lakshmi et al. 2013) for which the world is prepared; however, the deficient oral priming strategies yet are the major restraint in this area. An attempt was also made to get the complete mitochondrial genome map of O. sanctum from the sequence assembly by considering S. miltiorrhiza as the reference mitochondrial genome instead of Origanum vulgare which was the reference chloroplast genome (Fig. 10.4) . A total of 48 scaffolds from 140 contigs from cp genome, and 41 scaffolds from 124 contigs from the mitochondrial genome got generated (Table 10 .2). Mitochondria play a significant role in the development of plant, maintaining its health as well as in plant reproduction. They are said to be semi-autonomous due to their own genetic system that makes it function for energy production, maintaining cell homeostasis and metabolism. Similar to other organisms, the plant mitochondrial genome determines a sequence of crucial polypeptides that put together the oxidative phosphorylation chain complexes with nuclear-encoded subunits. However, plant mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) have distinguished characteristics that differentiate them from their fungal and animal counterparts. Particularly, higher plants contain large mtDNAs which greatly vary in sizes and structural make up. Furthermore, mitochondria in many plant species comprise a range of plasmids which are capable of independent replication. In comparison to animal mtDNA sequences, the majority of plant species harbor slow-evolving mtDNA gene sequences with an extremely low rate of point mutations. It is so due to the fact that mitochondrial DNA recombination system is very active and hence permits the mutations copy correction. Certainly, several investigations have demonstrated that mitochondrial genome of plants endures massive and highly frequent homologous recombination (HR). These events increase the rate of recurrence of rearrangements in plant mtDNA. Many characteristics of plant mtDNA genetics make it much complicated than most the other organisms. The ability of integration and/or expansion of intervening non-coding genetic sequences in the genomes of organelles is notable, particularly in comparison to the severely condensed mtDNA of mammals. It may therefore be hypothesized that advantage of sequences is associated to the competency of plant mitochondria for bringing in the DNA (Koulintchenko et al. 2003) . Particularly, both the plasmid acquisition and the competency to import are common to mitochondria of fungus (Weber-Lot fi et al. 2009). On the other hand, mammalian organelles too are proficient (Koulintchenko et al. 2006 ) with stable genome size. Besides, many years later to the breakthrough, the importance of mitochondrial plasmids and their interaction with the core genome of mitochondria are yet obscure. It is not sequence content only, but the physical structure of the plant mitochondrial DNA is an intricate blend that results either from or by holds up an array of maintenance and replication method. Though unusual in organelles of mammals, recombination plays a key role in determining plant mitochondrial genomes, reorganizing sequences, creating polymorphism, compelling evolution, and simultaneously conserving the genetic information. Eventually, challenge that stays behind is to know, that how could the high agility of the plant mitochondrial DNA be amalgamated with gene preservation, coordinating inter-compartment genome and apposite functional competence of the organelles. In this regard, it could be noticed that, despite reported mutants, mitochondrial DNA maps and restriction profiles have also been replicated persistently for a lot of species and generations, which is indicative of the fact that, even though vibrant and energetic, the genome of plant mitochondria remains constant or stable on an apparent timescale. Genome data, in addition to the metabolomics, proteomic and transcriptomic information, could thus be helpful in predicting the biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites as well as their regulation. This would prove to be a reform in research leading to discovery fulfilling the goal to identify with the metabolic activities and genetics of medicinal plants.",

O. sanctum is a model herbal plant used in the traditional Ayurvedic and Unani system of herbal medicine since ages (Pattanayak et al. 2010 ). It has incomparable health healing properties, and therefore is regarded as a 'boon' which provides health and longevity. Within few decades, bioactive compounds isolated from this plant may become the foundation for new pharmaceutical drugs. However, vague and scattered information of the ethnomedicines and unlinked databases to the other biomedical databases are the major obstacles for the development of phytomolecules isolated from O. sanctum into pharmaceutical drug with therapeutic efficacies. Therefore, the availability whole genome sequence of O. sanctum may help in developing few databases for sorting information concerned with single or multiple aspects of medicinal plants, like biologically active metabolites, ethnobotany, medicinal uses, information based on genome and or transcriptome, and molecular targeting active ingredients.

Different plant part (leaf, stem, and root) contains a varying amount of many bioactive compounds which can be classified into several important classes on the basis of their synthesis in plants: terpenes (isoprenoids), polyketides, alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids. All of these classes contain many high-value chemicals whose genome sequence information is still unavailable. Identification of the biosynthetic gene involved in the production of such commercially important phytochemicals is often challenging. Prediction of the specific function to individual genes is a long and complex process because of limited genomic resources. For example, Orientin and Vicenin-2 are plant flavonoid specifically isolated from the leaf extract of O. sanctum extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti-aging, antiviral, antiinflammation, vasodilation, cardioprotective, radioprotective properties (Lam et al. 2016 ). Yet the underlying pathways and the mechanism of action of these flavonoid c-glycosides have remained indecisive. Similarly, putative genes and the network involved in the production of many other phytomolecules isolated from Ocimum such as ocimumosides, ocimarins, cirsimaritin, circineol are still unknown. Therefore, the availability of massive data in terms of the whole genome sequence of O. sanctum can be an efficient method for the investigation of the gene and gene families involved in the production these phytomolecules. Few examples of such compounds are illustrated in Table 10 .3.",

Table 10 .4 reports the significant contribution of Ocimum genomics taking account of studies carried out at transcriptome, metabolome, and bioinformatics level leading to an assimilated knowledge of its natural products biosynthesis. But with the advent of draft genome of Ocimum, the sequences analysis may help in the identification of the small changes in amino acid at the substrate binding sites of metabolite biosynthesis pathway genes conferring unique therapeutic properties to this medicinal herb. Beside the genomics, in the recent years, the research on in vitro methods of growing the Ocimum by the micropropagation and regeneration via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has also taken pace. There are still many such compounds needed to be explored which could be the foundation of many new pharmaceutical drugs synthesized artificially. There is an increasing demand of O. sanctum in pharmaceutical industry and is exploited regularly for its valuable compounds. This imposes a constant repression on the genetic diversity and its germplasm (Bhau 2012) . With the advancement of DNA-based different molecular markers, conservation of biodiversity of medicinal plant could be supported. Molecular marker-based approaches can also be used for the medicinal crop improvement and molecular breeding strategies. Molecular markers are the unique DNA sequences used for determining genetic diversity among the individual or a population. These DNA sequences may be helpful in the identification of homologous sequences in another related species (Canter et al. 2005 Rastogi et al. (2015) , simple sequence repeat (SSR) in the O. sanctum whole genome was predicted. A total of 4827 sequences which were greater than 500 bp length were studied for SSR and of total obtained sequences, 2612 possessed SSR repeats while the remaining (2364) sequences had more than one SSR ( Fig. 10.6 ). The SSR markers obtained from O. sanctum can be utilized for the quantification of genetic diversity among different Ocimum genotype (Zietkiewicz et al. 1994; Dhawan et al. 2016 ). Prediction of other DNA-based markers from O. sanctum whole genome sequencing may bring advancement in breeding strategies as well as in resolving the problems faced during convectional breeding of Ocimum species. It could also be used for alteration of various traits among Ocimum species, for example; a cold tolerant gene from O. kilimandscharicum could be manipulated for the development of a cold tolerant O. sanctum. Similarly, many other genes from different biosynthetic pathways could be manipulated for the development of superior traits.",

Due to the sessile nature of plants, their genomes had undergone evolution for generating an organism which adapts to the constant environmental changes. Additionally, in response to the theory of natural selection, the local wild-type crops have been sorted for preferred traits via plant breeding. Up to now, the selection breeding and the plant adaptability have produced plants that constitute several secondary metabolites. Nevertheless, global warming and the simultaneous diminution in the arable land, existing breeding approaches only would be unable in maintaining the endurance capacity or the exquisite metabolic composition of the plants. Hence, getting a comprehensive overview of the molecular networks operational in plants which regulate plant secondary metabolism is becoming essential in order to engineer those, as well as the detection of the novel genome-based markers for selecting such phenotypes would be critical to obtain the plants with specialized metabolic composition. Availability of the whole genome sequence of O. sanctum will definitely accelerate the research of functional genes related to secondary metabolism. Such research can greatly contribute in the development of drug discovery based on natural product and acceptable exploitation of plant pharmaceutics sources. The genome sequence along with transcriptome sequence of O. sanctum can be greatly utilized for the genome re-sequencing which will be helpful in the detection of genetic molecular markers (GMMS), such as InDel, SSR, and SNP. Through the recent advances in NGS technologies, the genome sequencing of many targeted medicinal plant has now became possible because of reduced cost and lesser time utilized in the sequencing process. Sequencing and assembly of more and more medicinal plant will lead to the development of comparative genomics which would prove a widespread means to study the secondary metabolism of such therapeutic plants. Furthermore, studies on GMMS genetic linkage and the improved character, genotype, and phenotype of curative plant might play a major role in the molecular breeding of medicinal plants as well as in the development of the transgenics of such medicinal plants.",
