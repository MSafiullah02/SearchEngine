Accredited by both Joint Commission international (JCI) and The Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutes (CBAHI), Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare keeps safety of visitors, patients, employees, and physicians as its highest priority. Having a realistic staffing and business continuity plan in place would have ensured that the department would function at a high level even in the most challenging times. Also, knowing that \u201cnow is the time to act\u201d, step-by-step strategies were implemented by the department to ensure that we are able to put our patients first. Being a proud recipient of gold certification for excellence in Person-Centered Care by Planetree International, all of the above measures have been made with an emphasis on our commitment to the culture of person-centered care.1 Patient-centered approach with the focus on patient care and safety was always kept in mind when introducing new plans or changing our existing care plan. Pharmacists from inpatient pharmacy department provided this care in close coordination as part of multidisciplinary team either through a collaborative practice agreement or as a part of the patient's healthcare team.",

The committee consists of an infectious disease specialist, hospitalist, clinical pharmacists, respiratory therapy, nursing, health informatics, and other functional areas. Number of available articles and protocols were reviewed, and organization specific COVID-19 protocol for adult and pediatric patients has been developed.The core function of computerized physician order entry is the capture and transmission of clinical orders; however most computerized physician order entry systems incorporate support for a variety of time-saving devices such as care protocols and order sets. Order sets are collections of orders grouped by a clinical purpose.2 With this in mind, the COVID-19 protocol was used to design computerized physician order set to standardize patient care by integrating best practices through multiple disciplines, levels of care and services. The order set was created by the team from healthcare informatics, reviewed and incorporated into organization's electronic health records. The pharmacists made important contributions to the medication component of the order set with the following key points in mind:\u2022The order set shall reduce variation, and unintentional oversight through standardized formatting.\u2022Integrate safety alerts, pertinent reminders, and \u201cbest practices\u201d using the clinical decision support system. One example of \u201cbest practice\u201d includes justification of use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.3\n\u2022Restricting use of certain medications and devices based on evidence from available literature to avoid inappropriate utilization such as nebulizers.4\n\u2022Every medication included in the order set was reviewed to ensure appropriate selection of drug, dose, route, and frequency.\n",
