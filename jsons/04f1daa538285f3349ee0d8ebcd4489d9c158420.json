During sneezing, breathing and loud conservation, it releases about 1000 micro droplets which drift in the air. These micro droplets carry many viruses and it might act as a third route of infection for COVID 19 infection. The type of infection is known as micro droplets infection.",

Sima Asadi and team 1 , explained the role of aerosols in transmission of COVID 19 published in Aerosol Science and Technology journal. They described two possible mode of COVID 19 aerosols transmission; a) during a sneeze or a cough, \"droplet sprays\" of virus-laden respiratory tract fluid, typically greater than 5 \u00b5m in diameter, impact directly on a susceptible individual and b) alternatively, a susceptible person can inhale microscopic aerosol particles consisting of the residual solid components of evaporated respiratory droplets, which are tiny enough (<5 \u00b5m) to remain airborne for hours.",

Some virologist still claimed that virus spreads only when the patient cough or sneeze, releasing respiratory droplets that carry the virus. Therefore, I agree with Sima Asadi and co-author idea, that, it is time for the aerosols scientists to step in and provide the technology and hard data to either corroborate or reject that hypothesis.",
