            "text": "Since the first reports in 1975 of its presence in stool as determined by electron microscopy (EM), the existence of human enteric coronavirus (HEC) has been debated (Caul et al., 1975, Mathan et al., 1975). Some investigators have considered these particles as viruses and as potential pathogens in human diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolitis, and malabsorption. Others cite their variable size and appearance, their presence in control stool specimens and failure to be cultivated in tissue culture as evidence that they might represent cell debris or even portions of other microorganisms (Macnaughton and Davies, 1981). Critical to its acceptance as a virus and a potential human pathogen is its growth in (a) readily available cell line(s) and the accessibility of virus seed stocks in a depository like the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). It will also be important to exclude the possibility that HEC is not a known human respiratory coronavirus strain (229E or OC43) that for some reason has been found in stool or that the virus does not represent a laboratory contaminant of a known animal coronavirus, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).",

In contrast to endemic NEC, these outbreaks were in older, higher birth weight infants and the case fatality rate was lower. Coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) were seen in stools by EM and the virus could be passed in human fetal intestinal organ culture. However, embryonic tissues were available in only a few centers and soon we also could not obtain these tissues. This report details the adaptation of HEC to a mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line (J744 cells), and to a mosquito cell line derived from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes (C6/36 cells). J774 cells were used because they support the growth of MHV. The use of C6/36 cells was a chance event. These cells were growing in the laboratory and we included them in the cells that were tested.",

The C6/36 cells were maintained at 28\u00b0C while the other cells were kept at 37\u00b0C. Virus seed stock was prepared by passing HEC 15 times in HFI organ cultures and three times in J774 cells.

For demonstration of the virus and its antigenic characteristics, this virus seed stock, a later passage in J774 cells or low passage virus in C6/36 cells were used.

The PAGE separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% NP40 in TBS overnight. After drying, strips were cut for WB. The WB strips were reacted overnight with sera at a 1:50 dilution followed by the addition of biotinylated anti-human or animal antisera (1:250 dilution), streptavidin peroxidase (1:250 dilution) followed by color development after the addition of a chromogenic substrate. Between each step, the strips were washed three times in tris-buffered saline. The biotinylated antisera and streptavidin peroxidase were obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD. Hemagglutination studies were performed with mouse erythryocytes, 0.05%, suspended in PBS, pH 7.4. OC43 and 229E antigens and antisera were obtained from Dr John Hierholzer of the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. For WB, antigens were further purified by equilibrium sucrose density ultracentrifugation.

However, C6/36 cells could be utilized. Although infected C6/36 cells were brightly stained by human immune sera, they were not stained by a 1:10 dilution of OC43 antiserum and only non-specifically by 229E antiserum.

Note in panel 1 the reaction of Patient 1, IgM to two protein bands located below 49 kDa and the absence of any reactions to these bands with 229E, OC43, and \u03b1 N antisera. The second and third panels demonstrate IgM antibody reactions to the protein band below 49 kDa as well as to other proteins. A WB was also prepared from infected C6/36 cells and similar and additional bands were observed (Fig. 7\n). Since we used prestained molecular weight markers, we can only estimate the molecular weights of HEC. In average, the proteins range in molecular weight from 24 to 190 kDa; the major protein (N) centers at about 41 kDa. Two other protein bands are seen, one at 124 kDa and the other at 64 kDa, particularly in the C6/36 cell preparation.

It has the EM appearance and size of a coronavirus and proteins consistent with that of other coronaviruses but distinctive in several regards. These proteins react with immune human sera. Antisera to OC43, 229E viruses, and \u03b1 N antiserum against MHV (A59) do not stain the N protein of HEC. By averaging different preparations, the proteins of HEC range in molecular weight from 24 kDa, presumably the M protein to 190 kDa, the S protein. Inconstant bands are present at 124 and 64 kDa and could represent breakdown products of the S protein. The major protein, N, appears to center around 41 kDa, a size different from OC43 and 229E viruses. Antibodies to HEC may be prevalent in certain populations as determined by our capacity to obtain sera with IgM reactivity. The patients with AIDS had sera collected in the 1980s, a relatively early part of the HIV epidemic.",

Toroviruses can be found in stools of animals and humans and have elongated peplomers. They have, however, a morphologically unique nucleocapsid that is coiled into a hollow tube with a diameter of 23 nm and an average length of 104 nm. The molecular weights of torovirus proteins are different from that of coronaviruses.",

That virus differs form the HEC described in this report in that it has an N protein that approximates 50 kDa and also has a hemagglutinin/esterase glycoprotein. The N protein of BCV has an antigenic relation to the N protein of OC43 whereas the N protein of HEC is apparently distinct from OC43.

Caul and associates reported cultivation of these particles in human embryo intestinal organ culture and human embryo kidney monolayers (Caul and Clarke, 1975). They were not able to prepare virus seed stocks that could be distributed to other investigators. In the early 1980s, four investigative groups found evidence of these particles in stool and tried to relate them to disease. In Paris, CVLPs were associated with outbreaks of NEC in 1979 and 1980 in separate hospitals within the city (Chaney et al., 1982, Rousset et al., 1984). In Italy, they were associated with childhood diarrhea and Gerna and colleagues presented evidence that linked them antigenically to OC43 virus (Gerna et al., 1981, Gerna et al., 1984, Gerna et al., 1985). In Arizona, Ray and associates related their presence to diarrheal disease in the nursery and then to diarrhea in the community (Vaucher et al., 1982, Mortensen et al., 1985). In Dallas, Texas in 1982\u20131983, several outbreaks of NEC and diarrhea occurred in a Special Care Nursery at Parkland Memorial Hospital (Resta et al., 1985). The disease outbreaks suggested a transmissible agent since they affected older children, had a lower case fatality rate, tended to occur as clusters of cases, and disease incidence could be related to breaks in enteric isolation techniques. Using stool samples from these infants, a coronavirus was isolated in human fetal intestinal organ cultures.",
