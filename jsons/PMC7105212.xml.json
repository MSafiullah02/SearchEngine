            "text": "Human plasma is a rich source of biochemical products which can function as indicators of the physiological or clinical status of patients [1], [2], [3]. It also evidences high-protein content, including proteins that are synthesized and secreted, shed, or lost from body cells and tissues [4], [5]. These protein concentrations in plasma are controlled tightly to balance their physiological functions in areas including immunity, coagulation, small molecule transport, inflammation, and lipid metabolism [6]. Therefore, changes in plasma protein concentrations can be considered reflective of the current state of health [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Recently, the discovery of biomarkers from blood plasma has become the subject of intensive attention, with the considerable advances that have thus far been made in proteomic research [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The analysis of large numbers of proteins via proteomic techniques has greatly accelerated our ability to identify new biomarkers for disease or toxicity processes, including cancer [17], diabetes [18], stroke [19], kidney diseases [20], and exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons [11], [12], [13]. However, it has been estimated that up to 10,000 proteins may be normally present in plasma, the concentrations of which would vary, from millimolar concentrations for albumin to femtomolar concentrations of low abundant components [1], [4]. The majority of potential disease biomarkers may be present at extremely low concentrations within the plasma, and thus might be obscured by the presence of more abundant proteins with similar characteristics [1], [4].",

Owing to these advantages, 2-DE has been used extensively for the discovery of new biomarkers [1], [3]. Examples of biomarkers identified via 2-DE are provided in Table 1\n[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39].",

In serum, prothrombin is cleaved into thrombin, fibrinogen is removed to facilitate clot formation, and a limited series of other protein changes (including proteolytic cleavages) occur during the clotting process [4]. Although many of the proteins involved in the coagulation process, including prothrombin, will disappear during these procedures, many of the peptides that are absent in plasma but are detectable in the serum can be identified after coagulation [45]. In studies of the differences between human serum and plasma using an orthogonal 3D intact protein analysis system (IPAS), several proteins, including alpha, beta, and gamma fibrinogens, as well as vitronectin, have been shown to be attributable to coagulation-associated proteins [43]. In addition, proteins which were expected to be depleted during the coagulation process were generally much lower in the serum samples, as compared with the EDTA-plasma or citrate-plasma. Tammen et al. reported in their peptidomic analysis of human blood specimens that a variety of artificial peptides are derived from peptides released during coagulation processes or from other types of enzymatic activity (plasma kalikrein) [45]. Due to the high levels of artificial peptide signals, they concluded that the use of serum samples is not appropriate for peptidomic studies of mono/oligo biomarker discovery.",

A treated blood sample can then be centrifuged in order to remove the blood cells, thereby leaving the plasma for subsequent studies. Although plasma compositionally resembles serum, it is preferred over serum for proteome studies by many (although not all) laboratory investigations, as its constituents reflect patient pathological status more closely than do the serum constituents. In addition, some changes in the blood constituents can be avoided via the careful selection and control of the types and concentrations of the employed anticoagulants [41]. The most popular anticoagulants are EDTA, heparin, and sodium citrate. There have been several reports of changes in protein expression patterns occurring in conjunction with anticoagulant treatment [41], [44]. Citrate and EDTA inhibit coagulation and other enzymatic processes via the chelate-formation of ion-dependent enzymes, in contrast to heparin, which functions via the activation of antithrombin III. In general, the maintenance of hemostasis and the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis essentially requires a series of enzymatic reactions, which cause sequential activation and the inactivation of protease, and platelet activation causing clot formation. Accordingly, the concentrations of plasma proteins are dependent on platelet stability [44]. Platelets tend to be most stable in citrate anticoagulants. EDTA-treated blood is only slightly less stable. However, over longer time periods, marked changes become apparent as the elapsed time prior to centrifugation increases [45].",

This non-specific binding probably includes both proteins that bind to the dye as well as some minor proteins that bind albumin [59], [67]. Despite this high degree of non-specific protein binding, this method has several advantages, including high-loading capacity and low cost [65]. Due to their relatively low cost, they are disposable, which prevents any cross-contamination between different samples [66].",

Individual antibody methods have proven more specific in the depletion of targeted proteins, and resulted in a more complete removal of abundant proteins [48], [49], [51], [60]. Monoclonal antibodies appear to represent a promising option for the depletion of high-abundant proteins, and have been used to target a specific epitope of these proteins, thereby resulting in the removal of the targeted proteins. However, this technique may not be appropriate for the recognition of all forms of the targeted protein, due to the presence of proteolytic fragments, post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as glycosylation, phosporylation, the disruption of the antigen-binding site in partially or completely unfolded proteins, or the occlusion of the epitope as the result of protein-protein interactions [48].",

This method is capable of the depletion of high-abundant proteins, including different molecular forms and many proteolytic products of these proteins, coupled with low nonspecific losses of other proteins, rapidly and efficiently, in a single purification step [50], [58], [62], [65], [66]. An immunodepletion system based on IgY employed chicken antibodies, which orient the antibody with the antigen-binding site facing outward, with a constant portion of the antibodies covalently coupled to a solid phase material. This permits maximum antigen binding efficiency. This system also allows for the depletion of human albumin, IgG, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and the transferrin, and depletion of albumin in a variety of mammalian species [64]. The principal disadvantages of antibody-based depletion include its relatively high cost and low sample capacity. Fortunately, antibodies are highly robust proteins, it appears likely that such systems will last for many purification cycles if appropriate care is taken to minimize both proteolysis and column clogging. Multicomponent immunoaffinity columns have recently become commercially available [54]. Although these commercial kits are relatively expensive, they are also quite convenient and useful for small samples, such as those that can be applied to electrophoretic gels.",

The spontaneous degradation of urea to cyanate can occur at room temperature. Cyanate ions remove the positive charges on amine and sulfhydryl groups in proteins (a process known as carbamylation), thereby affecting the efficiency of IEF. DTT is an effective cyanate scavenger. Rabilloud et al. reported on the utility of thiourea-containing denaturing mixtures for proteins that are highly prone to aggregation [78], [83]. The use of thiourea in combination with urea, for IEF in particular, has been determined to improve the solubilization of hydrophobic proteins [84]. Thiourea is normally used at a 2 M concentration in combination with 5 M to 7 M urea.

When a voltage is applied during IEF, each carrier ampholyte moves into the closest pI, resulting in a continuous pH gradient [79]. Ampholytes may be utilized in concentrations as high as 2% (v/v). Carrier ampholytes also scavenge cyanate ions and facilitate the precipitation of nucleic acids during centrifugation [74]. The objective of solubilization processes is to achieve a well-focused first-dimensional separation: IEF. Additional solubility problems frequently arise during the IEF at sample entry and solubility at the isoelectric point. These problems can be solved by the use of a commercial (IPG) gel, which is prepared by the covalent incorporation of a gradient of acidic and basic buffering groups into a polyacrylamide gel, during the gel casting procedure.",

Although a variety of proteomic techniques have been attempted so far, no generally applicable technique has yet been developed for the identification of biomarkers that can replace 2-DE with regard to its ability to separate and display several thousand plasma proteins simultaneously. The selection of an appropriate blood plasma preparation method is important for confident 2-DE results. The use of anticoagulants and protease inhibitors during blood collection increases the chances for consistent results. The removal of abundant proteins using multicomponent immunodepletion systems allows us to compile profiles of proteins occurring in low concentrations in the plasma. Desalting and acetone precipitation improve the pattern generated during 2-DE, although this may result in the loss of several proteins. These techniques harbor promise for more widespread use in the preparation of samples for the identification of biomarkers that can be used in early disease detection, as well as to monitor disease progression and augment the accuracy of the prognosis using human blood plasma.",
