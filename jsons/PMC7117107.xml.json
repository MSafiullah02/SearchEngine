Recently, the isolation of these and other strains from feces of dairy calves (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006), and from retail meat products in Canada (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2007) has raised epidemiologic interest.",

Despite the recent association between C. difficile toxins and calf diarrhea, the role of C. difficile as a causal pathogen in calves is unknown. In other species, the histological and functional lesions attributable to C. difficile are associated with the local effect of two exotoxins, toxins A and B (Schirmer and Aktories, 2004). A binary toxin (known as CDT) has also been hypothesized to be another virulence cofactor (Geric et al., 2006).",

These finding contrasts previous studies in hamsters, piglets and foals where diarrhea was induced in most animals within 48\u201372 h of oral infection (Arroyo et al., 2004, Jones et al., 1988, Post et al., 2000, Sambol et al., 2001). It is uncertain if diarrhea would have developed later, if calves had been monitored further. As CDAD in humans occur a few days after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy (Beaugerie et al., 2003), some models of infection include the concurrent administration of antimicrobials to facilitate the induction of CDAD (Sambol et al., 2002). Antimicrobials were not used in this study as the main objective was to investigate the sole effect of an early ingestion of C. difficile. It is unknown if diarrhea had occurred if these calves had received antimicrobials. However, the failure to induce disease in the absence of antimicrobial therapy indicates a difference in susceptibility compared to neonatal foals (Arroyo et al., 2004), and questions the role of C. difficile as a primary pathogen in calves. It is important to consider, however, that failure to induce disease experimentally does not rule out the possibility that C. difficile is a bovine pathogen. Rather it indicates that simple exposure to C. difficile is not adequate to cause disease.",

In animals, despite its regular use in hospital settings, validation studies are scarce. In piglets the ELISA performance approached human standards (Post et al., 2002); but in dogs, it was considered poorly sensitive and specific (Chouicha and Marks, 2006). Validation of available ELISAs is needed to better understand the significance of C. difficile in cattle.",
