Malignant tumors caused by esophageal cancer, and the relationship to environmental factors has been the focus of many public health studies. This study applied spatial analysis to ascertain the relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality rates nationwide. We employed two datasets, including a national investigation of esophageal cancer rates and distribution, and national water quality grades in China's primary rivers and lakes. Esophageal cancer data were grouped based on different water quality grades, which included a scaled buffer distance from rivers and lakes. Non-parametric correlation analyses were performed to examine the presence or absence of the following correlations: (i) esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes; and (ii) esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grade values. The present study revealed a significant positive correlation between widespread water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality nationwide; and a significant negative correlation between esophageal cancer mortality, and buffer distance from rivers and lakes.",

            "text": "Esophageal cancer is one of the most common human malignant tumors worldwide. The World Health Report 2004 ranked esophageal cancer as the highest cause of cancer mortality in China. Among the 446,000 cases of death caused by esophageal cancer worldwide, more than half occurred in China, i.e. 228 thousand (WHO, 2004) . A national sample survey of malignant tumor mortality conducted between 2003 and 2006 showed the esophageal cancer mortality rate ranked fourth in China, following gastric, liver, and lung cancers. In recent years, the rapid economic growth in China has amplified the increasingly polluted waters in several main rivers and lakes, resulting in substantial threats to the health of residents living adjacent to these ecosystems (Van Grinsven et al., 2006; Kenneth et al., 1987; Wang and Liu, 2006; Chang, 2006; Hu et al., 2009; Song et al., 2008; Zhen et al., 2008) . To date, it has not been definitively established if pollution is a major risk factor for esophageal cancer on a national scale. Consequently, specific measures at the national level to counter the effects of water pollution, and reduce/prevent esophageal cancer rates have not been implemented. Therefore, medical geography research (Yang et al., 2010) , which identifies the degree of health effects and associated geographic patterns, will serve to examine water pollution in major rivers and lakes of China, the relationship with increased rates of esophageal cancer, and establish any significant correlation between increased pollution and disease. Disease prevention is of primary importance to elucidate pathogenesis, and formulate strategies and countermeasures to prevent and treat esophageal cancer in China.",

            "text": "Research on cancer risk factors remains the foundation and focus of cancer prevention and treatment investigations (Zhang and Wang, 2009; James, 1999; Brownstein et al., 2002; Gatton et al., 2005; David et al., 2012) . Presently, risk factor research is focused on poor eating habits (Lei et al., 2006) , smoking and other unhealthy lifestyles , stress and other mental health and illness factors (Pan, 2006) , the absence of trace elements in diets (Yang, 2009; Huang et al., 2002) , upper gastrointestinal disease history (Yang et al., 2008) , genetic predisposition for various cancers (Luan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2008) , economic conditions (Tong et al., 2007) , and food contamination and carcinogens in the local environment, including water (Farhad et al., 2009; Nobuaki et al. 1996; . Most studies on the relationship between esophageal cancer and water pollution reflect the individual case specifics in a distinct geographic region (Han et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2002; Wei et al., 1999; Soliman et al., 2006) . Some studies have conducted spatial-temporal analyses of esophageal cancer (Jacob et al., 2008; Nuria et al., 2007; Mohammadreza et al., 2011) , particularly the relationship between high localized incidence of esophageal cancer and environmental degradation of major drainage systems at the national scale. Previous research on environment and malignant tumor-related issues primarily adopted traditional approaches, including epidemiological investigations (Baudouin et al., 2002) , statistical analyses of risk factors in specific medical populations (James, 2004; Manami et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2006) , and laboratory testing (Peng et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008) , among other methods. Two major differences have been identified between these two approaches. One method emphasizes statistical parameters to explain a relationship (Liao et al., 2012; Kulldorff, 2005) between risk factors and malignant cancers. This methodology serves an important role in determining the mechanisms that influence cancer and the spatial threshold range of cancer and its risk factors (Liu et al., 2003; . Unfortunately, policy dictates that some studies must apply administrative divisions as research units, which prevent the effects of rivers, lakes, and other natural topographical units as risk factors in cancer research (Jiang et al., 2009; Li and Wang, 2005) . In recent years, a combination of traditional statistical methods and spatial analyses has facilitated enhanced understanding of the relationship between disease and the environment (Kate et al., 2008; Rogers and Randolph, 2003; Melissa et al., 2011; Hubbard et al., 2002; .",

Alternatively, as the distance from a river and population increases, a concomitant decrease occurs in the probability a population will fetch water from that river. People will choose alternative sources of water if rivers and lakes are not close geographically. Furthermore, the impacts of infiltration resistance result in the contamination of groundwater from adjacent polluted rivers and lakes, which is also inversely proportional to the distance from rivers and lakes. Beyond a certain distance, water contamination exhibits no effect on groundwater quality. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a distance threshold.

However, these studies were scattered in different parts of the region with a high incidence of esophageal cancer. Moreover, the environmental contaminant indicators selected for the studies were varied, such as pollution index and nitrosamines (Sabo-Attwood et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2010) . Research methods also differed, including laboratory analyses that examined the influence of carcinogenic substances on the human body's internal environment, epidemiological investigations, and comparative analyses of case studies, among other approaches. We adopted SEPA/MEP standard water quality grades for China's major rivers and lakes, and used the distance from rivers and lakes as a unified and comparable indicator to explore the relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer at a national scale. By combining statistical and spatial analyses, the influence of water pollution on esophageal cancer mortality was objectively analyzed.",

Neighborhood function, buffer zone, and other spatial analyses were employed to achieve enhanced correspondence between geographic and administrative units, with increased mastery of the spatial relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality.

The esophageal cancer mortality at sampling sites in five buffer zones closer and five buffer zones further away from rivers and lakes showed a respective 80.4% and 19.6% of the total among the 47 sampling sites. Therefore, within the distance threshold (20 km), the resident distance from the polluted water sources indicated an effect on esophageal cancer mortality among residents. Due to infiltration resistance limitations, and distance costs for people fetching drinking water from water sources, the closer the water source (lower buffer distance), the higher esophageal cancer deaths; alternatively, the greater the distance to water sources (greater buffer distance), the lower the number of esophageal cancer deaths.",

We identified significant correlations affecting esophageal cancer mortality in China: (i) esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes; and (ii) esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grade values. The results clearly indicated that water pollution is a risk factor for esophageal cancer mortality in China. Environmental management must review water pollution, and integrate these health risk data into management plans to improve and sustain environmental and human health. Water quality must be elevated to acceptable levels in contaminated areas, and subsequently maintained at suitable standards to ensure the health of residents living in these areas will not be threatened in the future.",
