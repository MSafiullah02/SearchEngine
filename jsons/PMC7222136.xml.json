We defined the intervention as any therapies, strategies, or rehabilitation exercises directed at improving patient cognition or the domains of cognition. Examples of interventions included repeated tasks, games, skills, or questions such as orientation exercises in both writing and/or verbal exercises. We sought to find studies comparing patients who received the intervention and those that did not, and reported on our primary outcome of interest\u2014delirium. This review included original research articles such as randomized-controlled trials (RCT), quasi-experimental trials (i.e., non-RCT), observational trials, and pre/post intervention trials describing the application of cognitive interventions early in the ICU stay, as well as reporting on the burden (i.e., incidence, prevalence, severity) of delirium according to validated tools such as the CAM-ICU or ICDSC.11 English language publications studying either pediatric or adult critically ill populations were chosen.",

Therefore, performance bias was possible and the overall judgement of bias was deemed unclear.33 Of the studies that reported delirium outcomes, two were judged as having serious bias and one as having an unclear risk of bias (Tables 2 and 3).33\u201335 Notably, moderate to serious bias was detected in all three non-RCTs within the domain of outcome measurements.34\u201336 Two studies did not adequately describe a difference in personnel assessing outcomes and those delivering the intervention (Appendix B).35,36",

Alverez et al.30 conducted an RCT of 140 elderly ICU patients and reported a reduced delirium incidence (20% in the control group vs 3% in experimental group) after implementation of an occupational therapy led cognitive intervention protocol that included stimulation, rehabilitation, and training exercises (P = 0.001). Rivosecchi et al.34 included cognitive stimulation in a non-pharmacological delirium prevention bundle, and reported a reduced incidence of delirium between phase I (15.7%) and phase II (9.4%) of the study (P = 0.04). Additionally, a reduction in delirium duration was reported by Alverez et al.30 [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.15, P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12 to 0.19) vs IRR 6.7 (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 5.23 to 8.3) in the treatment group]; and by Rivosecchi et al.34 who reported a 51% reduction in delirium hours (P < 0.001). Colombo et al.35 showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of delirium (36% phase I vs 22% in phase II) after introducing a cognitive simulation protocol that included orientation, environmental, acoustic,\nand visual interventions (P = 0.020). While controlling for dementia, APACHE II, and mechanical ventilation, Rivosecchi et al.34 concluded patients were less likely to develop delirium after administration of a non-pharmacologic bundle that included music, exposure to daylight, orientation, and visual and hearing aids (P = 0.005). Munro et al.33 conducted a three-arm RCT of 30 patients testing a family led intervention via voice recordings and found an increase in mean delirium-free days in the family voice recording group (1.9 days) vs the control group (1.6 days; P = 0.04). Alvarez et al.30 also measured delirium severity using a delirium rating scale and there was no significant difference in mean delirium scores (10 points in control group vs 9 points in experimental group, P = 0.7). There was no significant difference in the mean time until development of delirium as reported by Rivosecchi et al. between phase I (58.5 hr) and phase II (53.8 hr) (P = 0.7).34",

Mitchell et al.32 showed that a family-oriented cognitive intervention is feasible and acceptable but a low family recruitment rate was reported (28%).

Therefore, it is not reasonable to draw conclusions regarding the specific type, dose, or component of cognitive interventions or if they would be efficacious in delirium prevention and management. This is especially true given the heterogeneity of populations reported across studies. Further study is necessary to test a standardized cognitive intervention protocol that may encompass cognitive stimulation, cognitive training, and cognitive rehabilitation exercises.

Our review indicates that family participation in delirium prevention strategies can complement those performed by nurses and other healthcare professionals.45 Family member participation may be particularly beneficial because of the personalized nature of cognitive stimulation, knowledge of the patient, and familiarity of voice.32,46 Additionally, family members may personally benefit from being able to directly participate in patient care and so gain a sense of purpose and control. Family involvement in the care of critically ill patients is an underutilized resource that certainly merits further consideration and study. While one identified study deemed cognitive interactions feasible and non-burdensome to nursing,36 future methodologically-robust research may determine if these interventions are indeed feasible for a variety of patient populations, sedation levels, nursing workloads, and severity of illnesses. Assessment of the combination of input from healthcare providers and family members is essential before providing recommendations that could be tailored to resources available within individual ICUs. Feasibility studies included in this review may assist with protocol development of future RCTs, such as the study by Mitchell et al.32 who provided a sample size estimate of 596 (80% power; P = 0.05). Additional studies are needed to elucidate the value of a standardized, multimodal cognitive intervention protocol combined with pharmacologic delirium prevention measures to determine the effect on delirium in critically ill patients.",

The studies included in this review were deemed to have critical, serious, or high risk of bias, limiting overarching conclusions on the effects of cognitive interventions. Additionally, the majority of articles were pilot or feasibility studies; therefore, it would be premature to form conclusions on delirium outcomes. Cross study conclusions regarding cognitive interventions were not possible because of the large variation in populations of critically ill patients included in the studies (e.g., ventilation status, ages, and severity of illness). There was considerable variation in the types of cognitive interventions used; therefore, it is not possible to compare these and recommend any single intervention or protocol. This review studied only English articles so there may be additional evidence available that we did not include. Finally, our review may be further limited by the databases we interrogated; while we searched six major databases, additional relevant studies may be available from sources not indexed in these chosen databases.",

It is anticipated that a considerable level of resources, training, and support would be required to implement additional non-pharmacologic interventions into current delirium prevention bundles.",
