            "text": "Epidemic diseases that spread across a large region of the world, such as the 1918 influenza pandemic (Spanish flu), the 2009 flu pandemic (H1N1), and the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), 1,2 can pose a challenge to healthcare resources worldwide. Basic measures such as personal hand cleaning and social distancing are crucial. However, according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, 3 protective material is essential for all healthcare providers. Pandemic crisis situations can induce a shortage of FFP2/3 protective face masks for healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses, dentists, carers, and paramedics in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The purpose and rationale of this article is to present a proof of concept (PoC) and prototype of a reusable custommade three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask, based on individual facial scanning, 3D modelling, and 3D printing, that can be adopted and used worldwide in case of need. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide. The surface tessellation language (STL) format of the original virtual templates of the two reusable components described in this paper can be downloaded free of charge using the hyperlink (Supplementary Material online).",

With the introduction of new-generation smartphones with at least two cameras and dedicated applications, modern imaging techniques like 3D facial scanning have become available worldwide. In the PoC presented here, 3D individualized facial scanning and export of the OBJ format data file by secure e-mail took less than 2 min 30 s. The 3D facial scanning procedure applied was safe. No self-scanning was performed and the scanned person had no physical contact with the smartphone, ruling out potential cross-contamination. The person who performs the 3D face scan and handles the smartphone needs to wear protection glasses, clothing, and a face mask, since interpersonal contact would be reduced to a critical distance of less than 1 m.",

One might assume that it is less precise than professional 3D cameras, but the study by Piedra-Casc\u00f3n et al. indicates a high precision. In their study, published in 2020, a mean precision value of 0.32 mm and a high intra-class correlation of 0.99 was found for 10 3D facial reconstructions when using a dual-structured light facial scanner (Face Camera Pro Bellus; Bellus3D, Campbell, CA, USA) that was mounted on a smartphone. 6 This hardware component makes the presented PoC workflow more broadly applicable since it is no longer limited to iPhone smartphones, but basically can be adapted to every type of smartphone or tablet with the facial scanner mentioned above.",

Clinical pictures in frontal and two-thirds right facial profile view (Fig. 2) show the clinical adaptation of a commercially available disposable surgical face mask and disposable FFP2 and FFP3 face masks on the same face. Although a mathematical Boolean calculation implements an accurate virtual adaptation of the individual 3D face mask to the corresponding static 3D facial mask (Fig. 2) , further clinical testing is ideally required both in static and dynamic situations.
