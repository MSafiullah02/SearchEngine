Currently, IB still occurs in nearly all poultry-producing countries; it is a highly contagious, acute, and economically important viral disease of chickens. The etiology of IB, which was first demonstrated by Beach and Schalm (1936), is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).",

            "text": "IBV is grouped in the genus Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales (de Groot et al., 2011). The coronavirus genomes are the largest among the known RNA viruses and are polycistronic, generating a nested set of subgenomic RNAs with common 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences (Masters, 2006). Like those of all other coronaviruses, the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the IBV genome consists of two large replicase open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. The ORF1a polyprotein (pp1a) can be extended with ORF1b-encoded sequences via a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift at a conserved slippery site (Brierley et al., 1987), which generates the polyprotein pp1ab, comprising more than 7000 amino acids, which includes the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase (HEL) activity (Ziebuhr et al., 2001). The pp1a and pp1ab of IBV are processed autocatalytically by two different viral proteases, encoded by a papain-like protease (PLP) and a 3C-loke protease (3CLpro) (Lee et al., 1991, Ziebuhr et al., 2000, Ziebuhr et al., 2001). Other putative domains, presumably associated with a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN) activity, a poly(U)-specific endo-RNase (XendoU) activity, and a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MT) activity, have been predicted in pp1ab (Ivanov et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 2003). The 3\u2032 end of a coronavirus genome includes the viral structural and accessory protein genes: a spike (S) glycoprotein gene; an envelope (E) protein gene; a membrane (M) glycoprotein gene; a nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein gene; and several ORFs that encode putative non-structural accessory proteins (Masters, 2006). Of the virus-encoded proteins, the S1 subunit of the S protein carries virus-neutralizing activity, determines the serotype of IBV and is responsible for viral attachment to cells. It is also a major determinant of cell tropism in culture (Casais et al., 2003). The accumulation of point mutations, deletions, insertions and recombination events that have been observed in multiple structural genes, especially the S1 gene, of IBV recovered from naturally occurring infections have been considered to contribute to the genetic diversity and evolution of IBV, and consequently, to a number of IBV serotypes (Cavanagh, 2007).",

            "text": "The occurrence and emergence of multiple serotypes of the virus have complicated control by vaccination because many serotypes and variants do not confer complete cross-protection against each other (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). The originally discovered Massachusetts (Mass) type of IBV was identified in the United States, beginning in the 1950s (Fabricant, 2000, Johnson and Marquardt, 1975, Mondal et al., 2001). Mass-type strains have been isolated in Europe and Asia since the 1950s and up to the present day (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008), together with dozens of other serotypes that have been isolated in Africa, Asia, India, Australia, Europe, and South America (Cavanagh, 2001, Cavanagh, 2003, Cavanagh, 2005). The first Mass-type \u201cH\u201d vaccines were developed in about 1960. They include H120 and H52 (Bijlenga et al., 2004), and are used very commonly and widely around the world. However, virus of this type is occasionally isolated from Massachusetts-vaccinated and -unvaccinated flocks with respiratory clinical signs. Some of the viruses have shown close genetic relationships with pathogenic Mass-type, rather than vaccine, strains by S1 gene analysis. However, conclusions based on the genetic analysis of a single gene sequence, and sometimes even a partial gene sequence, require caution because the true phylogeny can only be demonstrated by analyzing complete genomic sequences. Herein, we sequenced the complete genome of four IBV Mass-type strains that showed S1 gene diversity (Liu et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2011), and we present evidence for in-field recombination between pathogenic and vaccinal strains. Furthermore, we characterized the molecular variability of the four Mass-type strains to gain insight into the emergence and evolution of these viruses.",

Strain ck/CH/LHLJ/07VII was isolated in 2007 from the kidney of a layer hen vaccinated with H120 and 4/91 in Heilongjiang province, China (Liu et al., 2009). Strain ck/CH/LNM/091017 was isolated in 2009 from the swollen proventricular tissues of a broiler vaccinated with H120 in Neimenggu province, China (Sun et al., 2011). Strains ck/CH/LDL/101212 and ck/CH/LHLJ/100902, both of which were isolated in 2010, were obtained from laying hens in Dalian and Heilongjiang provinces, respectively, in China; the birds were suffering from nephropathogenic lesions and respiratory signs, respectively. In addition, the diseased birds in both flocks were suffering from proventriculitis (Ma et al., 2012). All of the IBV strains have been associated with various IB outbreaks in recent years in China and were assigned to the Mass-type strains by S1 sequence analysis. To avoid the possible mutation in the viral genome after serial passages in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs, the first passage of each original virus stock was used and purified once by propagating in 9- to 11-day-old SPF chicken eggs with a dose of l04-fold dilutions per egg, and the presence of viral particles in the allantoic fluids of inoculated eggs was confirmed with a negative contrast electronic microscope (JEM-1200, EX) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as described previously (Han et al., 2011). In addition, since these viruses were isolated from chickens vaccinated with H120, it is possible that mixed IBV infections are present in one chicken flock. To exclude this, nine clones of S1 gene of each virus obtained from three independent PCR reactions were sequenced and compared. Sequences of each virus identical to the previously results were obtained (Liu et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2011).",

In this study, we focused on the full-length genomic sequences of four IBV isolates which had been shown to be of the Mass-type by S1 gene analysis (Liu et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2011). Based on the high degree of similarity in the full genomic sequence, it could be concluded that two IBV strains, ck/CH/LNM/091017 and ck/CH/LDL/101212, were very similar to the vaccine strain H120. They might therefore represent re-isolations of vaccine strains, although they were isolated from vaccinated chickens with respiratory disease. Similarly, IBV strains that showed a very close relationship to the H120 vaccine strain have been isolated from unvaccinated broiler flocks in Slovenia with respiratory problems (Krape\u017e et al., 2010). Alternatively, these strains might be variants of vaccine strains that have resulted from accumulated point mutations after several passages in chickens. A few key mutations in the S1 subunit of the spike protein might result in a change to a new serotype, which is defined as a lack of cross-neutralization with specific sera against different IBV serotypes (Cavanagh et al., 1992). The point mutations found in the genome that distinguish between the two isolates and vaccine strain H120 might be the result of adaptive evolution driven by the host immune response when the vaccine strain was transmitted among chickens. Adaptive evolution is the process by which genetic changes in the viral genome leading to a more fit virus population become fixed over time, and it has been reported to occur in many coronaviruses (Hasoksuz et al., 2007, Lee and Jackwood, 2001, Shi et al., 2006, Tang et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2006).",

However, vaccination is not likely to be the only explanation for the circulation of Mass-type virus, because ck/CH/LHLJ/100902 and CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII were most closely related to a Massachusetts pathogenic type strain, M41. The isolation of a Massachusetts pathogenic strain from H120-vaccinated chicken flocks may be due to vaccination failure in these flocks (Han et al., 2011). Alternatively, molecular studies have shown that only a few changes in the amino acid composition of the S1 spike protein can result in immune failure, even when the majority of the virus genome remains unchanged (Cavanagh et al., 1992). Our findings showed that mutations had occurred in the genomes of both ck/CH/LHLJ/100902 and CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII, especially in the S1 genes of CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII though it was in the same group with H120 strain in the phylogenetic analysis, implicating that strain CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII has experienced evolution over time. It has been reported that amino acid changes may result from immunological pressure caused by the widespread use of vaccines (Cavanagh et al., 1988, Cavanagh et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The occurrence of recombination events is another process that allows new strains to emerge, and this has been well documented in IBV (Hughes, 2011, Jia et al., 1995, Kottier et al., 1995, Kusters et al., 1990, Wang et al., 1993) and other coronaviruses (Fu and Baric, 1992, Fu and Baric, 1994, Makino et al., 1986). It is believed that the conditions for recombination amongst IBV strains in the field are as follows: an extremely large number of chickens, most maintained at high density; the ease of spread of the virus; and serotype co-circulation, including proof of co-infection with more than one serotype in a given flock (Cavanagh, 2007). In China, intensive chicken farms are concentrated in many provinces, including Heilongjiang, where ck/CH/LHLJ/07VII was isolated (Liu et al., 2009). Almost all the chickens in China receive Mass-type vaccines at a very young age and subsequently receive this vaccine a couple more times during the rest of their life span. Therefore the vaccine virus exists constantly in chickens; it may persist in various internal organs for 163 days or longer (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Generally, vaccination using the H120 vaccine provides full protection against pathogenic Mass-type pathogenic IBVs and prevents the same type of pathogenic strain from being replicated and spreading in the flocks. However, a single amino acid substitution at position 63 of the S1 subunit of the spike has resulted in escape mutants of Mass 41 (Cavanagh et al., 1988). This may have occurred in the case of the ck/CH/LHLJ/07VII S1 gene (Liu et al., 2009), which might have made it possible for both pathogenic and vaccine strains to co-exist in a given flock, leading to the occurrence of recombination. Similarly, an escape mutant could be a result of adaptive evolution driven by the host immune response. Consequently, it is likely that genetic changes due to adaptive evolution and recombination both contributed to the origin and evolution of strain ck/CH/LHLJ/07VII: it is possible that adaptive evolution created a mutant, followed by recombination between Mass 41- and H120-like strains to create a novel virus.",

            "text": "The recombination events from which the CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII virus resulted can be explained by a scenario in which the recombination may have involved two parental viral strains, with initiation of RNA replication in a M41-like template of either negative or positive polarity (Liao and Lai, 1992). This would be followed by switching of the polymerase-nascent cRNA complex to an H120-like virus template. The switch may have occurred at the 3\u2032-end of the N gene. In general, for a recombinant virus to emerge and establish itself in the field, it must be viable and have selective advantages. It has been reported that uptake of canine coronavirus (CCV) sequences by type II feline coronavirus (FCoV) may have led to increased viral fitness when compared with type I FCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Recombination can also result in the emergence of new strains with distinct characteristics, such as pathogenicity and tissue tropism (Worobey and Holmes, 1999). In addition, in the CoV genome, as with most RNA viruses, the 3\u2032-UTRs usually harbor important structural elements that are involved in replication and/or translation (Chang et al., 1994, Raman et al., 2003, Raman and Brian, 2005, Goebel et al., 2006, Z\u00fcst et al., 2008). In IBV, the 3\u2032-UTR-binds to the N protein, which is essential for the synthesis of negative-strain viral RNA. Perhaps the acquisition of the 3\u2032 end of the N gene and the 3\u2032-UTR from H120-like virus by an M41-like virus (e.g. CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII) can alter the efficiency of viral replication. This alteration may in turn affect pathogenicity. However, it remains unknown whether this is the true origin of CK/CH/LHLJ/07VII, and therefore this strain is of particular importance to the surveillance of IBV in China. It will be of equal importance to examine future outbreaks of IBV in chickens by full-length genomic sequence analysis in the context of novel recombination events among IBV strains. Furthermore, investigations using reverse genetic systems might provide further insight into these issues and increase our understanding of IBV pathogenesis.",
