Silkworm as a model lepidopteran insect and important economic insect, has been widely studied in life science, however, the current knowledge on the glycosylation status of its proteome is not satisfactory, and little is known about how pathogenic infections could affect the glycosylation status. This study performed large scale glycosite mapping for the silkworm Bombyx mori P50 strain, and quantitatively compared with that infected with the Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV). Some 400 glycoproteins were mapped in the silkworm, including N-and O-glycoproteins. Upon virus infection, the glycosylation levels of 41 N-glycopeptides were significantly changed, some of them belonging to transmembrane glycoproteins. The O-glycosylation profiles were also affected. In addition, 4 BmCPV-encoded viral proteins were found to be glycosylated for the first time, including polyhedrin, P101, VP3, and the NS protein. This study drafted a silkworm protein glycosylation map and underlined the potential impact of virus infection on glycosylation.",

Glycosylation, being one of the most common and diverse PTMs, has been widely acknowledged in vertebrates as an important indicator of their physiological or pathological state [3] , however, very little is known about how glycosylation are altered in lower organisms, like during a pathogen invasion.

The mapping strategy, which was first introduced by Zielinska et al. [13] , uses high precision mass spectrometer for detection of a +2.988 Da mass shift after enzymatic deamidation of the N-glycosylated asparagine residue in O 18 water. Taking advantage of the greatly reduced glycosylation complexity due to removal of the N-glycans, we were also able to simultaneously map the O-glycosites and their associated glycans by searching against an insect O-glycan panel. Additionally, the glycosylation profile of the virus-encoded proteins were obtained. Transmembrane glycoproteins and significantly regulated glycoproteins upon virus infection were marked, which provides clues for future investigation of the role of glycosylation during viral infection in invertebrate systems.",

Polyhedrin has typical molecular weight of 27-31 kDa, but no significant sequence similarities were found between the polyhedrins derived from the CPVs of different host species [9, 24, 25] . While baculovirus polyhedrin has been found with glycosylation potential [23] , there has been controversy on whether the cypovirus polyhedrin is glycosylated or not. It has been previously suggested to be glycosylated based on positive color-reactions with acid-Schiff reagent [11] , however, molecular cloning of this protein showed that polydedrin does not contain a transmembrane signal peptides which guide peptide glycosylation [9] . In this study, glycosite mapping showed that BmCPV polyhedrin is Nglycosylated at the single site N77, confirming that it is a glycoprotein, and it is speculated that the sugar coating could further enhance the stability and protection of the virion. Another glycoproteins P101, which is a 101 kDa protein encoded by the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f genome segment 5, was identified with a single glycosylation site at N684, although this protein was predicted with three possible N-glycosylation sites based on motif analysis [26] . The other two viral glycoproteins were VP3, a capping protein [8] , which was glycosylated at N801 and the non-structural (NS) protein, which was mapped with three glycosylation sites at N69, N48, and N138. The functions of these viral proteins have not been clarified or experimentally validated so far, and even less is known about what their glycosylation does for these proteins during virus infections. Therefore, it would be of great interest to investigate these glycosylated viral proteins and their roles during virus infection.",

Previous studies showed that silkworm integrin beta interacts with the BmCPV virion, and that silencing integrin beta gene could inhibit viral infection to the silkworm [33] . Our data showed that integrin beta was upregulated during BmCPV infection, indicating its potential role as a cell adhesion receptor facilitating viral propagation. Sepin, a glycosylated serin protease inhibitor, was previously found significantly upregulated in the bacteria-infected fat body of the silkworm [34] , similar to what we observed in the silkworm upon viral infection in this study.",

However, another interesting observation is that while the glycopeptide (N181) of SSR was downregulated, its glycopeptide at N126 wass upregulated. The results indicate that while viral infection affects the level of protein glycosylation, it may or may not influence in the same way. Therefore, to evaluate or compare the profiles of multiply glycosylated proteins, it is necessary to locate individual glycopeptides instead of the glycoprotein as a whole, because each glycosylation site might change independently from the rest of the glycosylation sites upon perturbation or stimuli. The O-glycosylation mapping results for the P50 control and virus-infected groups were shown in Table 3 . Only those identified at least twice in the triplicate were retained for comparison purposes.

The samples were washed by 200 \u00b5L buffer A three times. Afterwards, 50 \u00b5L of 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 in H 2 18 O was added to precondition the filter and discarded by centrifugation. This step was repeated twice. The filter was placed in new collection tube and 40 \u00b5L PNGase F (500 units) added to the filter and the samples were incubated for 3 hours at 37 \u00b0C. The deglycosylated (or deamidated) peptides were eluted by centrifugation and the filter was washed with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 in H 2 18 O twice and the elution was combined. The samples were then desalted using a Zip-Tip (Merck Millipore) protocol according to the manufacture's protocol and ready for LC-MS analysis. The deamidated peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap100 sample concentrating column (100 \u03bcm\u00d72 cm, Thermo Scientific) and then separated by an C18 capillary column (75 \u00b5m\u00d710 cm, 3 \u00b5m). Buffer A contained 0.1% formic acid in water and buffer B was 0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile. The peptide sample was separated at a flow rate of 250 nL/min using a 2 hour gradient. MS analysis was performed on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). After each full scan, top ten intense precursor ions were isolated and fragmented using HCD at an isolation window of 2 m/z and normalized collision energy of 30 eV. LC-MS raw data were directed processed by Peaks Studio software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) for identification of proteins and post translational modifications as described previously [14]. Briefly, Silkworm reference proteome (Uniprot ID UP000005204) was used as the protein database, and the parameters used for database searching was: 10 ppm as parent mass tolerance, 0.1 Da as fragment mass tolerance, 2 missed cleavages for tryptic digestion, carbamidomethyl as the fixed modification, methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, and asparagine deamidation (+2.988 Da) as the variable modifications.

These 41 differentially regulated glycoproteins were categorized in metabolic processes, cell adhesion as well as in response to stimulus (Figure 2b), indicating a change of molecular interactions by the virus infection. There have been evidences that pathogens can hijack host's glycosylation system to manipulate immune responses to the advantage of the pathogen [4]. Thus, the changes in the glycosylation level can modulate cellular and molecular functions, which is likely for the purpose of increasing the host susceptibility to the infection. Again, a lot glycoproteins were uncharacterized, and further investigations on these proteins may be necessary and insightful for understanding the molecular mechanisms during the virus infection. Among the 14 downregulated glycopeptides, the signal sequence receptor (SSR, Q2F5L0) showed the most significant difference (p = 2.5\u00d710 -6 ) (Figure 2c). SSR is an integral, glycosylated protein of the rough ER membrane and mediates the translocation of a peptide across the ER membrane [31]. The significant downregulation of SSR indicates that BmCPV infection may induce ER stress and influence the glycosylation level of SSR as a part of the ER stress response. The significantly upregulated glycopeptides include several enzyme classes such as oxidases and peptidases, and several other proteins including DNA supercoiling factor, serpin, and integrin beta (Figure 2d). Among these, integrin beta are a family of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f evolutionarily conserved transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate bidirectional transmembrane signaling and cell to cell interactions, and are important in many",

Due to the high diversity of O-glycosylation and its close association with various pathological and physiological states, the ability to reveal the O-glycans and their attached sites, especially in a large scale, becomes very demanding. In this study, due to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f deamidation process that removes the N-glycans from the peptide, the workload for database searching was greatly reduced, which makes it possible to perform large scale O-glycosylation mapping at the same time during N-glycosite mapping.",

By comparing to the current study, it was noticed that the arylphorin protein, a type of the storage proteins, was heavily O-glycosylated in the 306 and NB strains [14], however, it was not being modified by O-glycosylation in the P50 strain, neither in the control nor BmCPV-infected groups. The silkworm storage protein (H9JHM9), myosin regulatory light chain 2 (Q1HPS0), and several other uncharacterized proteins (H9JRT0, H9JXG1, H9J9M0) were found to be O-glycosylated in all P50, 306 and NB strains, although the glycosylation site and glycan profiles were somewhat different",
