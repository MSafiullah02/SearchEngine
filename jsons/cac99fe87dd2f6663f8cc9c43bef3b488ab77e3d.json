As a result, cultural rights have been understood as inseparable from human rights and require protection mechanisms within particular international (including regional) legal systems. The European continent is proud to have developed one of the most effective mechanisms of the human rights protection by establishing the Council of Europe and adopting the European Court of Human Rights. The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 reformulated many concepts of access to human rights and possibilities to enjoy freedoms. Even if access to culture (access to cultural heritage) has been available online for many years, it is the time of globally occurring lockdowns that forced people to stay home and found themselves in a situation when all of a sudden online access to culture became the only way of access to culture. The article aims to analyze the current situation in Europe by asking questions if and how online access to culture is recognized and protected under the Council of Europe's mechanisms with special emphasis on the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in this field.",

As it was stated in 2010 Akdeniz v. Turkey case, the individual cannot claim to be a \"victim\" of violation of Article 10 of the Convention if he had access to searched materials (in this case music) by numerous means, excluding the Internet. Indeed the right to access the materials via one of the sources (9) (14) 416 (Internet was limited), however it does not mean that he had no possibility to access it in other ways. The ECtHR had a chance to underline the significance of specific websites providing access to culture. In the 2015 ruling Cengiz and Others v. Turkey the Court found that the applicants (two law professors actively using YouTube to access, download and share videos for professional purposes) could be considered as victims of the alleged breach of Article 10 as they all had YouTube accounts and made substantial use of its services for professional purposes. The Court also emphasized the importance of YouTube in exercising the freedom of expression, in disseminating and exchanging not only artistic and musical creations but also political ideas and information.",

Firstly, the Court developed its case-law on reconciling freedom of artistic expression and the protection of morals in the 2014 judgment Akda\u015f v. Turkey. This judgment was issued in the case related to the limitation in publishing a specific book considered immoral in Turkey. The Court stated that countries introducing any limits based on the requirements of morality need to take into consideration the existence, within the single state, of various cultural, religious, civil or philosophical communities. Therefore, the Court presented the concept of a \"European literary heritage\" and set out various criteria in this regard: the author's international reputation; the date of the first publication; a large number of countries and languages in which publication had taken place; publication in book form and on the Internet; and publication in a prestigious collection in the author's home country. The Court concluded that the public of a given language, could not be prevented from having access to work that is part of such heritage.",

Firstly, the ECtHR directly stated that access to culture via Internet (as well as television) is the manifestation of the human right stated in the article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights that is the freedom of expression. Secondly, the ECtHR directly confirmed that the right of access to cultural heritage, (which may be communicated on various levels and be referred to various spheres of human life)-can be both individual and collective and, may touch public and private areas. As a result, the ECtHR established a wide approach to the problem of culture and cultural heritage availability. The role of the Internet was noted by the Council of Europe in its Strategy for 2016-2019 which underlined the core value of the Internet as \"an invaluable pace for the exercise of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and information, of critical value for democracy. Its capacity to allow people to impart and exchange ideas (\u2026) offers the potential to promote understanding and tolerance between people (\u2026) [and] connecting their voices to the Internet (\u2026) is important for pluralism and diversity in dialogue, and for bridging gaps between States and citizens\" [11, pp. 9-12]. 2 Internet is a very important medium for culture accessibility and a platform for exchanging various ideas and thoughts. Access to culture via Internet has not been recognized as a human right as the result of violation thereof, but as the result of the intensive development of that medium its enormous influence on people's habits and behaviors [8, pp. 6-7] .",
