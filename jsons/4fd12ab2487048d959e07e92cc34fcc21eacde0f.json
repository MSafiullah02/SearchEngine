The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the",

Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.",

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as nCoV -19) has been 4 associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 [2]. Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor 6 on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins, and explored the binary 7 interaction of these two partners [8, 23] . In this work, we focused our 8 analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects: (1) 9 The architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in 10 many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ACE2 receptor; 11 (2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-RBD toward 12 different ACE2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a 13 divergent interface sequences (3) ; A comparison of the interaction hotspots 14 between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, (4) whether any of the 15 studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding property compared to 16 the reference allele. To tackle these questions we used multi-scale modelling 17 approaches in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysis. with discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories. For the 57 RBD sequences, the best substitution model for maximum likelihood (ML) 58 calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on MEGA 59 6 software based on the lowest BIC score.

Because it is more adapted to predict the 85 effect of punctual variations of amino acids, we used DynaMut at this stage 86 of analysis [13]. 87 2.4 Flexibility analysis 88 We ran a protocol to simulate the spike RBD fluctuation of SARS-CoV-2 89 and SARS-CoV using the standalone program CABS-flex (version 0.9.14) [7] . 90 Three replicates of the simulation with different seeds were conducted using 91 a temperature value of 1.4 (dimensionless value related to the physical 92 temperature). The protein backbone was kept fully flexible and the number 93 of the Monte Carlo cycles was set to 100. 94 3 Results",

            "text": "To investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolate evolves 114 by increasing the affinity toward the ACE2 receptor in the final host, we 115 predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein (SP) 116 from several clinically relevant coronavirus isolates with hACE2 receptor 117 (PDB files for the complexes are listed in Supplementary Materials 1). The 118 construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses 119 a template structure in which both partners (ligand and receptor) are closely 120 related to those in the target system respectively. In our study, we only 121 modeled the interaction of the RBD which was shown to be implicated in the 122 physical interaction with ACE2 ( Figure 2A ). The lowest sequence identity 123 of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous 124 ACE2 sequences (Human, civet, bat, pig, rat, chicken and snake) do not fall 125 below 63% toward their respective templates. At such values of sequence 126 identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share 127 the same binding mode [6] . We calculated the binding energy scores of the RBD from different virus 131 isolates interacting with hACE2 ( Figure 2b ). All three methods used 132 for the calculation are in agreement that RBDs from bat-SL-CoVZC45, 133 bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and Rm1 show the worst energy scores. While the 134 binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for 135 PRODIGY calculation (section 2, Supplementary material 2), the differences 136 in the scores calculated by FoldX and MM-GBSA are not. Therefore we 137 consider that such differences in energies compared to SARS-CoV-2 are 138 consistent between the three methods. Except for FoldX, the affinity is 139 predicted to be more favorable for RBD from SARS-CoV-2 compared to 140 SARS-CoV. However, MM-GBSA only marginally discriminates between 141 the two values. MM-GBSA allowed us to assign the contribution of each amino acid in 161 the interface with hACE2, in the binding energy score. We conducted this 162 analysis using both sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 ( Figure 3A ) 163 and the Sino1-11 SARS-CoV ( Figure 3B) isolates. Residues F486, Y489, 164 Q493, G496, T500 and N501 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD forming the hotspots of 165 the interface with hACE2 protein were investigated (we only consider values 166 > 1 or < 1 kcal/mol to ignore the effect due to the thermal fluctuation). 167 All these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the 168 linear interface segment ( Figure 3C ): two from the N and C termini and one 169 central. T500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains 170 with Y41 and N330 of hACE2. N501 forms another hydrogen bond with 171 ACE2 residue K353 buried within the interface. On the other hand, SARS-172 CoV RBD interface contains five residues ( Figure 3D ), L473, Y476, Y485, 173 T487 and T488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot residues of RBD 174 from SARS-CoV-2 F487, Y490, G497, T501 and N502. Therefore, Q493 as 175 a hotspot amino acid is specific to SARS-CoV-2 interface. The equivalent 176 residue N480 in SARS-CoV only shows a non-significant contribution of 177 0.18 kcal/mol.",

The use of RBD sequences, however, 250 places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs 251 including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in 252 figure 1A , seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This 253 is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably 254 affect the topology of the tree. However, The significant divergence in 255 the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the 256 determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying 257 their impact on the interaction with hACE2. The binding of the spike 258 glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. In the 259 case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of Bat-SL-260 CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the binding 261 energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in 262 the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary 263 forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy 264 score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high 265 affinity toward hACE2. On the other hand, our results show that the 266 binding energy score and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are 267 closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other species). 268 Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might 269 have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the current 270 SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the virus to 271 acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. The 272 recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested 273 by Wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis [4] . Thereafter, incremental 274 changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a 275 better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499 276 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the 277 interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition 278 of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in 279 SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary 280 to what Wan et al [17] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not 281 seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible 282 for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals 283 by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the 284 same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution 285 decreases from -2.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of -0.01 kcal/mol, 286 thus supporting our claim.",

            "text": "No major divergence of the interaction interface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD 288 with hACE2 was noticed from the similarity matrix analysis. This suggests 289 that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might 290 also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ACE2 291 and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form. 292 Therefore, it is unlikely that the interface of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 is a 293 result of human intervention via genetic engineering aiming to increase the 294 affinity toward ACE2. For example, residue E484 contributes unfavorably 295 to the binding energy with 2.24 kcal/mol due to an electrostatic repulsion 296 with E75 from hACE2. This residue is an apparent choice for engineering 297 a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting E484 with a 298 polar residue. It is, however, noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the 299 nodes of SARS-CoV-2 group, in comparison to SARS-CoV, may suggest 300 a higher tolerance for the mutation of the new virus which would allow 301 it to cross the species barrier more easily and to efficiently optimize the 302 interaction in the host. being understanding about his absence and for not being able to bring him 311 the marshmallow candy because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
