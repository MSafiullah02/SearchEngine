Ayurveda, the oldest traditional system of India, reveals that ancient Indians had a rich knowledge of medicinal value of different plants. India has been endowed with a very rich flora owing to the extreme variations in climate and geographical conditions prevalent in the country. With the advent in science, many of the crude drugs used in traditional system have been investigated scientifically. Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. is a medicinal plant widely used in Indian traditional system of medicine for curing various ailments.[1] It grows in rice fields, dry waste places and cultivated lands in tropical parts of India. It is distributed throughout India, Sri Lanka, Africa and Australia from sea level to 1200 m altitude.[2] Synonyms of S. indicus Linn. are Sphaeranthus hirtus Willd. and Sphaeranthus mollis Roxb.",

Leaves dried in the shade and powdered are used in doses of 20 grains twice a day in chronic skin diseases as an antisyphilitic and a nervine tonic.[22\u201324] Hot water extract of the herb is used as an anthelminitic, as a diuretic, as a fish poison[2526] and as an aphrodisiac.[27] Flowers are tonic, cooling, alterative and used in conjunctivitis[26] and give strength to weak eyes.[24] The oil prepared using the plant root is reportedly useful in treating scrofula and as an aphrodisiac. The external application of a paste of this herb is beneficial in treating pruritus and edema, arthritis, filariasis, gout and cervical adenopathy.[28] Pulverized seeds have antimicrobial property. It is also stuffed into holes of crabs to kill them. Aqueous extract is poisonous to American cockroaches.[29] In unani, the herb is used as a tonic, laxative, emmenagogue, and also it increases the appetite, enriches the blood, lessens inflammation, cools the brain and gives luster to the eye, is good for sore eyes, jaundice, scalding of urine, gleet, biliousness, boils, scabies, ringworm in the waist, diseases of the chest. The plant is traditionally used for diarrhoea.[30] The entire plant is used as an emmenogogue.[31] Hot water extract of the entire plant is used for glandular swelling of the neck and for jaundice.[32]",

However, less information is available regarding the clinical, toxicity, and phytoanalytical properties of this plant. Several phytochemical studies have been reported but still it needs to progress. With the availability of primary information, further studies can be carried out like clinical evaluation, phytoanalytical studies and toxicity evaluation. The plant is preclinically evaluated to some extent; if these claims are scientifically evaluated clinically, then it can provide good remedies and help the mankind in various ailments.",
