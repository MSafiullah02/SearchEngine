We are reminded by our government and our news media on an almost weekly if not daily basis of the potential for a terrorist attack. Terrorist threats have been broadly categorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as national security emergencies to the population at large. These threats, which are posed by either hostile governments or extremists, are grouped by FEMA into broad categories. These include the simple \u201cthreat\u201d of a terrorist act, the assassination of high-level officials, kidnappings, hijackings, cyberattacks on our nation\u2019s computer-based infrastructure, both bomb scares and actual bombings, chemical and biological attacks, and nuclear and radiological attacks [1].",

The indiscriminate attacks on our society using the simple act of sending anthrax spores through the mail, though fortunately limited in scope, made an entire nation aware of our vulnerability to terrorist attacks using biological agents. Theretofore, most Americans considered mail delivered by the US Postal Service as safe. They did not seriously consider that the mail could be used as a weapon to attack us with biological agents. Widespread fear and public uncertainty were created. An entire Senate office building was closed for several weeks. Other government buildings, including post offices, were closed. The resultant economic impact for the post-9/11 anthrax incident on the Postal Service was $1.65 billion [3].",

Their model showed that in addition to the pandemonium created, the economic impact of a bioterrorist attack could range from an estimated $477.7 million per 100,000 persons exposed (B. melitensis scenario) to $26.2 billion per 100,000 persons exposed (anthrax scenario).

The sarin (neurotoxin) attack in a Japanese subway a few years back was an example of a controlled-release attack [5]. Unlike biological agents, most chemical agents, in general, have more immediate effects. Although these agents are generally lethal, they are difficult to deliver in concentrations that will produce widespread mortality.

Both Keller and Anet pointed out that their analyses indicated that IND assembly is beyond the scope of an individual terrorist. Keller quoted former United Nations weapons inspector David Albright: \u201cYou can do it in facilities that look like barns, garages, with simple machine tools. You can do it with 10 to 15 people, not all Ph.D.\u2019s, but some engineers, technicians. Our judgement is that a gun-type device is well within the capability of a terrorist organization\u201d [10]. Carnegie Endowment senior associate Rose Gottemoeller indicated in her testimony to the House Subcommittee on National Security that the principal barrier to fashioning a gun-type or Hiroshima-style nuclear device is in obtaining a large amount of weapons-grade nuclear material, such as highly enriched uranium or plutonium [12].",

The second modeled an RDD explosion using a 60Co pencil in Battery Park at the southern end of Manhattan. These 60Co pencils, 1 inch in diameter and 1 ft long, are used to sterilize food in processing plants across the country. The third model employed a small source of 241Am, similar to americium sources found in oil well surveying equipment. This material was modeled being spread from the detonation of 1 lb of TNT at Times Square in New York. Both 137Ce and 60Co are high-energy \u03b3 emitters. 241Am is an \u03b1 particle emitter [13].",
