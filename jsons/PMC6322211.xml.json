Computational analysis of the physical interactions led to the mapping of 622 complexes, suggesting an average of 4 proteins per complex (Havugimana et al., 2012). These estimates are also supported by other analysis indicating that most of the mammalian complexes are formed by the association of three or four different proteins. Importantly, some host proteins are found in more than one complex at a time (Wong et al., 2008). Similarly, a study in human cells combining large-scale immunoprecipitation of 331 bait proteins followed by high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis led to the discovery of 6463 interactions between 2235 unique proteins, suggesting an average of 3 proteins per complex (Ewing et al., 2007).",

In addition, high-throughput technologies analyzing PPIs, gene loss of function, or transcriptomic profiles have been utilized to define cellular complexes implicated in different steps of the viral life cycle. Large-scale physical analysis of PPI is conducted by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens (Calderwood et al., 2007; de Chassey et al., 2008; Fossum et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011; Rajagopala, Casjens, & Uetz, 2011; Shapira et al., 2009; Trigg et al., 2017; Uetz et al., 2006) and tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (TAP\u2013MS) (Germain et al., 2014; Jager, Cimermancic, et al., 2011; Jager, Gulbahce, et al., 2011; Pichlmair et al., 2012; Ramage et al., 2015; Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2012). Y2H screens can analyze only binary interactions, whereas TAP\u2013MS allows for the identification of more complex interactors. Then, the physical interactions identified with these methods are subjected to organization in functional networks by computational approaches. Despite of their rate of success in PPIs identification, both methodologies interrogating physical interactions of proteins fail to detect multiple types of PPIs. For example, interactions involving transmembrane proteins, or transient/weak interactions escape detection.",

These patterns are generated by the activation of similar biological processes by different pathogens, indicating the existence of pathogen-induced processes (Dyer et al., 2008; Pichlmair et al., 2012; Vance, Isberg, & Portnoy, 2009). The viral manipulation of the activity of type I interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISG) illustrates this concept. Protein Kinase, RNA-activated (PKR) is an ISG that upon activation phosphorylates the \u03b1-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2, inhibiting protein synthesis. Viral dsRNA is the main PKR activator in virus-infected cells, whereas the cellular protein PACT (Protein activator of PKR), that heterodimerizes with PKR, is an important activator of the kinase in stressed, noninfected cells in the absence of dsRNA (Li et al., 2006; Patel & Sen, 1998). HIV-1 evades the robust type I IFN response mounted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in infected individuals by rewiring the PACT/PKR complex. In infected cells, HIV-1 TAR nucleates a complex with the viral protein Tat and the cellular proteins PACT and ADAR1 (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1). In this complex, ADAR1 inhibits PACT PKR activatory function by direct interaction with PACT (Clerzius et al., 2013). Another example of pathogen-induced host complex rewiring will be discussed later in relation to the role of HIV-1 accessory proteins in the targeting of the ubiquitin/proteasome system to degrade different restriction factors.",

For example, assessment of the interaction of each of the 10 viral proteins encoded by influenza with 12,000 human ORF through Y2H screening found 135 interactions with 87 human proteins (Shapira et al., 2009). These evidences support a model indicating that viral proteins evolve multiple direct interactions.

These findings demonstrate that influenza, and potentially other viruses, hijacks cellular networks by combining physical and regulatory (transcriptional level) interactions with these pathways. This multilayer regulation offers further alternatives of blocking physical or regulatory interactions aiming to impair viral replication. Interestingly some of the host factors found in the networks of protein interacting with viral proteins are induced at the transcriptional level by infection in a type I IFN-independent manner (Shapira et al., 2009). This indicates that viruses modulate, at the transcriptional levels, the abundance of proteins that will engage in physical binary or multiprotein complex interactions.

Generally host factors interacting with viral proteins tend to preserve the host protein interactions mapped in noninfected cells (Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2011), indicating that the normal host protein complexes rather than new virus-induced protein complexes are implicated in viral replication. This opens the opportunity to utilize the current body of knowledge on the human interactome to define the host complex hijacked by viruses. However, examples of virus-specific complex variants also occur. Among them, one of the best characterized is the complex between HIV-1 Vif and the transcriptional and protein degradation cellular machineries. Vif removes APOBEC3 family restriction factors by targeting the ubiquitin ligase complex CUL5 to this restriction factor, and inducing its proteasome-mediated degradation. Other HIV-1 proteins, Vpu and Vpr, also exploit cullin-RING E3 ligase to degrade other restriction factors. Vif directly interacts with the substrate, the transcription factor CBF-\u03b2, the N-terminus of CUL5 (cullin-RING E3 ligase), and the heterodimeric substrate adaptor EloB/EloC. In turn, the C-terminus of CUL5 binds Rbx2 and recruits an E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme that mediates the transfer of polyubiquitin to the substrate proteins (Jager, Kim, et al., 2011; Zhang, Du, Evans, Yu, & Yu, 2011). CBF-\u03b2 is required in this complex for the assembly of the Vif\u2013CUL5 E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex, but not for the binding of Vif to the substrate (Zhang et al., 2011). CBF-\u03b2 normally heterodimerizes with the RUNX family of transcription factors preventing its degradation and Vif competes with RUNX1 for binding to CBF-\u03b2 (Guo et al., 2014).",

This characteristic reduced considerably the area required to be targeted by small molecules. Interrogation of the surfaces of binding in PPIs by mutagenesis of individual residues (alanine scanning) indicated that mutation of a few residues implicated in these binding surfaces was sufficient to disrupt the PPIs. Residues importantly contributing to the binding free energy were defined as hot spots (Clackson & Wells, 1995). These residues tend to cluster in tightly packed regions in the center of the surfaces of interactions and are called hot regions (Clackson & Wells, 1995; Keskin, Ma, & Nussinov, 2005). Hot spots can be amenable to drug targeting due to their small surface area and important contribution to the total binding energy of the complex. However, not always hot spots are vulnerable to drugs, as additional topological constraints for drug binding limit the number of druggable hot spots (Zerbe, Hall, Vajda, Whitty, & Kozakov, 2012). In addition, in silico analysis indicated that interfaces could contain more than one hot region, and in some PPIs the establishment of the complex depends on the cooperative interaction of different hot spots within the region (Keskin et al., 2005).",

Small molecules interrupting this interaction bind to the p53-binding pocket in MDM2 (Vassilev et al., 2004).",

LEDGF/p75 is a chromatin-bound protein required for efficient HIV-1 cDNA integration (Llano et al., 2006; Shun et al., 2007), an essential step in the viral life cycle. LEDGF/p75 binds to the dimer interface of the catalytic core domain of integrase. Two residues in the integrase-binding domain of LEDGF/p75 are essential in this interaction. Asp366 in an interhelical loop of the host protein contacts, via hydrogen bonds, with residues Glu170 and His171 in one integrase monomer, whereas LEDGF/p75 residue Ile365 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket (Leu102, Ala128, Trp132) in the other integrase subunit (Cherepanov, Ambrosio, Rahman, Ellenberger, & Engelman, 2005; Cherepanov, Sun, et al., 2005). ALLINIs bind to the viral integrase at the LEDGF/p75-binding site, preventing the binding of LEDGF/p75 and affecting integrase catalytic core domain dimerization. This disrupts integrase assembly with viral DNA and allosterically inhibits its activity (Engelman et al., 2013). 2-(Quinolin-3-yl) acetic acid derivatives (LEDGINs), and in particular compound 6, showed potent inhibitory activity of HIV-1 replication (Christ et al., 2010). This compound establishes hydrogen bonds with integrase residues Glu170, His171, and Thr173 that are hot spots in the LEDGF/p75-binding site in integrase (Christ et al., 2010). As ALLINIs were more potent against HIV-1 in cells lacking LEDGF/p75, the contribution of LEDGF/p75-binding inhibition to their mechanism of action is not clear (Wang et al., 2012).",

This is the result of the highly mutagenic rate of viruses. However, targeting host complexes utilized by viruses at the host\u2013host interface is expected to do not exhibit mechanisms of resistance, since host proteins are genetically more stable than their viral counterparts.

Inhibition of Mnk1 by CGP57380 specifically impairs protein synthesis in a variety of large DNA viruses (Walsh, Mathews, & Mohr, 2013). For example, this compound reduced by 102-fold the replication of HSV-1 in quiescent primary fibroblasts without affecting cell viability (Walsh & Mohr, 2004). In addition, CGP57380 inhibits reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (Walsh et al., 2013). Because Mnk1 is not essential for cell growth or development, it is a potential therapeutic target (Ueda, Watanabe-Fukunaga, Fukuyama, Nagata, & Fukunaga, 2004).",

Cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 6 (CPSF6) also binds to the same pocket in the capsid during HIV trafficking to the nucleus.

Within these complexes, viral proteins bind to cellular proteins that are central (bottleneck proteins) in the interacting networks and establish multiple interactions in the human interactome (hub proteins). These PPIs offer different opportunities for the development of small molecules to block viral replication. Virus\u2013virus, virus\u2013host, and host\u2013host PPIs are amenable for pharmacological disruption. Different viruses utilize similar host protein complexes during infection, showing overlap in the cellular processes hijacked. Targeting these shared cellular processes opens the possibility to generate broad-spectrum antivirals and general biomarkers of viral infection. Potentially, the innate immune system recognizes these shared pathogen-induced processes to counteract infection. A better understanding of this mechanism could greatly impact the development of stronger vaccine adjuvants.",
