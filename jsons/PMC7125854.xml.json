At present, serologic diagnosis of HBV infections is based on the viral antigens and antibodies. However, the REVEAL-HBV (risk evaluation of viral load elevation and associated liver disease/cancer-hepatitis B virus) study indicates that the serum level of HBV DNA (\u226710,000 copies/ml) is a strong risk predicator of hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis [2], [3]. It would thus be clinically valuable to have a molecular diagnostic method for screening and monitoring the progress of hepatitis. However, the long reaction time of traditional PCR amplification and the high cost of thermalcycler are still major issues for such a screening application. Therefore, it is important to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic device for field applications as soon as possible [4].",

There are several PCR-based amplification methods [5], such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification [6] and self-sustained sequence replication, for nucleic acid amplification. However, these methods require a precise instrument to provide the efficient thermal cycles and to shorten the total amplification time for a test run. In general, it takes up to 2.5 h for a PCR test with the present state of art equipment. Alternatively, isothermal amplification methods, e.g., strand displacement amplification [7], branched DNA amplification, invader, rolling circle amplification [8] and loop-mediated amplification method (LAMP) [9], have been proposed for amplifying the targeted nucleic acid sequence under a single working temperature condition with special designs for the buffer system and primers to prevent non-specific amplification. It would thus allow for the development of a low-cost device for rapid pathogen detection.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), originally developed by Notomi et al. [9], utilizes a designed set of six primers, termed inner and outer primers, to recognize specific gene sequences, and a polymerase with strand displacement activity to generate large amounts of amplified product (>109\n copies) within 1 h [10]. Moreover, it has been shown that the well-known PCR inhibitors in the blood (e.g., heme) have little impact on the LAMP reactions [11]. It is believed that the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase used in the LAMP reactions is more resistant to these inhibitors. Therefore, the LAMP reaction has been successfully applied for fast genetic screening tests in many acute infectious diseases, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[12], severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [13], human influenza viruses [14], [15], avian influenza viruses [16] and herpes viruses [17], [18], with special primer design and buffer adjustment. Among these, the LAMP method has been shown to have great promise for the amplification of HBV DNA. In addition, the DNA yield of the LAMP reaction (10 \u03bcg/25 \u03bcl) is much higher than that of the traditional PCR (0.2 \u03bcg/25 \u03bcl) [19]. Recently, we have successfully demonstrated that the level of turbidity, which is due to the by-product (magnesium pyrophosphate) of DNA polymerization, has a high correlation to the amounts of amplified DNA. Then, we decided to work with a total of 25 \u03bcl of LAMP reaction volume because of the practical limitations of turbidity detection. In addition to the use of the LAMP protocol, we have adapted a simulated chemical reaction to mimic the by-product production without using expensive polymerase and primers [20]. It can serve as an internal quality check for the system validation. Therefore, it is our intention to design and implement a compact integrated device with a disposable chip and simple quantitative optical read-out for low-cost applications.",

The melting temperature (T\nm) of each primer is calculated by the nearest-neighbor T\nm theory.

The disposable micro-reactor is constructed from two PMMA parts to create a reaction chamber of 5-mm optical path length by using UV-light curing adhesives (ultrawide GN150, Everwide Chemical Company, Yunlin County, Taiwan, ROC). For the LAMP reaction, the reaction chamber is filled with 25 \u03bcl reagent manually via micropipette and then is sealed with gluey aluminum foil. The base apparatus consists of an optical detection unit, a thin-film heater, a temperature controller, and a power supply. The optical detection unit (FS-V21G, KEYENCE Corporation, Osaka, Japan) employs a light emitting diode (LED) light source at 533 nm and a phototransistor detector with an extension of collimated optical fibers for the collection of forward scattering light. The temperature controller has a 60 W power supply and two 2 in. \u00d7 2 in. thin-film Kapton\u2122 heaters (Minco, Minneapolis, MN, USA), which is controlled by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller (ANLY Electronics, Taipei County, Taiwan, ROC) with one thermal coupler feedback.

It is assumed that the intensity of the input light is constant and that the samples have no absorbing constituents (DNA absorption peak: 260 nm) and that there are no changes in other loss mechanisms for the transmission of light, such as surface coatings, alignment, etc. Then the changes in detected light intensity can be ascribed to changes in total scattering.

When the reaction mixture is initially raised from room temperature to 65 \u00b0C, some microscopic clusters or particles may dissolve, causing an increase in the intensity of transmitted light. In 30 min, the turbidity of HBV LAMP reaction obviously changes. The standard curve shows that the numeric of the turbidity are highly correlated to the initial amounts of HBV template DNA (R\n2\n = 0.9605). After 30 min, gravity causes the numeric of turbidity to continually decrease because of the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation. Therefore, the numeric of turbidity in 30 min could be a critical point for judging the performance of the HBV LAMP reaction. In addition, the HBV LAMP reaction is also performed in the thermalcycler. The amplified products can be analyzed by electrophoresis to confirm the consistency of the LAMP reaction between our device and thermalcycler. In Fig. 5, we show that the electrophoretic result of the HBV LAMP reaction is performed in the thermalcycler (lane 1) or in our device (lane 2).

Seven serum specimens with chronic hepatitis B were collected from National Taiwan University Hospital. These clinical specimens had triplicate tests by HBV LAMP reaction with this integrated isothermal device. The HBV viral load of these seven samples ranged from an undetectable level to more than 5 \u00d7 107\n copies/ml for the testing of our device. The frequency of positive results in triplicate test represents by fractional number. In addition, our HBV LAMP reaction has good sensitivity (50 copies/25 \u03bcl). Even though the quantitative results from our device are higher than the data from real-time PCR, these results (Table 1) are valid to effectively distinguish the HBV DNA threshold level in the serum samples according to current protocol. Thus, using the integrated isothermal device provides great assistance for early diagnosing and monitoring the progress of chronic hepatitis B. However, there are several inhibitors from the blood samples that might potentially interfere with the amplification processes require further elucidations. In this study, the serum HBV viral DNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral DNA Mini Kit. The purified DNA is free of protein, nucleases, and other contaminants and inhibitors. In 2006, a study demonstrated that the LAMP assay does not require purified DNA for efficient DNA amplification [11]. These PCR inhibitors have little impact on the LAMP reactions even though there are inhibitors (e.g., heme) in blood could severely affect the amplification of DNA in PCR assays. As DNA polymerase have different susceptibilities to PCR inhibitors, they suspect that the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase used in the LAMP reactions is more resistant. In the future, the influence of various inhibitors, e.g., elevated levels of triglycerides, bilirubin, hemoglobin, and non-specific human DNA, will be addressed when we directly detect DNA from serum or heat-treated blood by LAMP. It would also be necessary for us to show that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis have no impact on the method during large-scale clinical experiment.

Using the LAMP reaction in the disposable micro-reactor component described here can amplify HBV DNA with high specificity and efficiency under isothermal conditions. The base apparatus component can also provide appropriate reaction conditions as well as a steady optical detection system for detecting turbidity derived from magnesium pyrophosphate formation without fluorescence labeling. Thus, using this integrated isothermal device greatly assists early diagnosing and monitoring the progress of chronic hepatitis B. It can improve the prognosis of patients and enormously save medical expenses. In the future, we hope to provide a multi-channel, portable, label-free, real-time monitoring medical device for rapid identification and quantification of pathogenic organisms and point-of-care applications.",
