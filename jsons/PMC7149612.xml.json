Populations are often defined in terms of target and study populations, and individuals within study populations in terms of exposure and outcome status. The purpose of much traditional epidemiological research is to quantify the strength of association between exposures and outcomes by comparing characteristics of groups of individuals. Exposures or risk factors include demographic, social, genetic, and environmental factors, and outcomes include infection or disease. In viral epidemiology, infection status is determined using diagnostic methods to detect viral proteins or nucleic acids, and serologic assays to measure immunologic markers of exposure to viral antigens. Infection status can be defined as acute, chronic, or latent.",

Traditional epidemiological and statistical methods often assume disease events in a population are independent of one another. In infectious disease epidemiology, individuals are defined in terms of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered or immune. Key characteristics of viral infections that determine the frequency and timing of transmission, and thus the epidemiology, include the mode of transmission (e.g., respiratory, gastrointestinal, sexual, blood-borne, and vector-borne), whether infection is transient or persistent, and whether immunity is short or long lasting. Temporal changes in the transmission dynamics of viral infection can be displayed with epidemic curves, by plotting the number or incidence of new infections over time to demonstrate outbreaks, seasonality, and the response to interventions.",

The reproductive number (R) is a function not only of characteristics of the viral pathogen (e.g., mode of transmission), but also the social contact network within which it is transmitted and changes over time in response to a decreasing number of susceptible individuals and control interventions. An important concept related to the interdependence of transmission events is herd immunity, the protection of susceptible individuals against infection in populations with a high proportion of immune individuals because of the low probability of an infectious individual coming in contact with a susceptible individual.",

Logs of user key words for pathogens, diseases, symptoms, and treatments, as well as information on user location contained in computer Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, allow temporal and spatial analyses of trends in search terms (Figure 1\n). Early results suggested that Google Flu Trends detected regional outbreaks of influenza 7\u201310 days before conventional surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Carneiro, 2009). However, accurate prediction was not as reliable as initially thought, and Google estimates did not closely match measured activity during the 2012\u20132013 influenza season.

ProMED relies on official announcements, media reports, and local observers, including the network of subscribers. A team of experts screen, review, and investigate reports before posting and often provide commentary. Reports are distributed by email to direct subscribers and posted on the ProMED-mail Web site. ProMED-mail currently reaches over 60,000 subscribers in at least 185 countries.Started in 2006 by epidemiologists and software developers at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, HealthMap monitors disease outbreaks and provides real-time surveillance of emerging public health threats, including viral infections (Figure 4). HealthMap organizes and displays data on disease outbreaks and surveillance using an automated process. Data sources include online news aggregators, eyewitness reports, expert-curated discussions and validated official reports.\n",

The goal of these studies is to link specific changes with an increased risk of infection or disease. As an example, a small subset of individuals who failed to acquire HIV infection despite exposure, prompted studies to determine how these individuals differed from those who acquired infection. A 32-base-pair deletion in the human CCR5 gene, now referred to as CCR5-delta 32, accounted for the resistance of these subjects. Individuals who are CCR5-delta 32 homozygotes are protected against HIV infection by CCR5-tropic HIV strains, while heterozygotes have decreased disease severity.",

For example, a single amino acid substitution in Epstein\u2013Barr virus was shown to disrupt antigen presentation by specific human leukocyte antigen polymorphisms (Liu, 2014). This resulted in decreased T-cell receptor recognition and successful viral immune escape. The virus must also induce an \u201coptimal\u201d host immune response to maximize transmission to new hosts. If the virus induces a strong, proinflammatory immune response not balanced by the appropriate anti-inflammatory responses, the host may succumb to the overabundance of inflammation and cannot propagate viral transmission. Alternatively, a virus that fails to stimulate an immune response may also replicate uninhibited, overwhelming, and killing the host prior to transmission. Selective pressures maximize replication while sustaining transmission between hosts.",

Typically, only a small number of virions are transmitted between hosts, creating a genetic bottleneck that limits viral diversity. A virus that mutates to cause highly pathogenic disease but is not transmitted cannot propagate its pathogenicity. Cross-immunity between viral strains also precludes the replication of particular viral lineages. Influenza vaccine strains require annual changes due to new circulating influenza strains that have escaped immune pressures through high mutation rates and gene re-assortment. The strong selection pressure of cross-immunity is reflected in the short branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree of influenza viruses isolated from infected individuals. Thus, the selection of influenza strains for future vaccines is partly determined by cross-immunity to prior circulating strains, because influenza viral strains that circulated in the past may elicit immune protection against currently circulating strains.",

Phylodynamic and phylogeographic models also have been useful in reconstructing the spatial spread of viruses to reveal hidden patterns of transmission. For example, epidemiological and molecular studies of influenza virus transmission were compared at different spatial scales to highlight the similarities and differences between these data sources (Viboud, 2013). The findings were broadly consistent with large-scale studies of interregional or inter-hemispheric spread in temperate regions with multiple viral introductions resulting in epidemics followed by interepidemic periods driven by seasonal bottlenecks. However, at smaller spatial scales\u2014such as a country or community\u2014epidemiological studies revealed spatially structured diffusion patterns that were not identified in molecular studies. Phylogenetic analyses of gag and env genes were used to assess the spatial dynamics of HIV transmission in rural Rakai District, Uganda, using data from a cohort of 14,594 individuals residing in 46 communities (Grabowski, 2014). Of the 95 phylogenetic clusters identified, almost half comprised two individuals sharing a household. Among the remaining clusters, almost three-quarters involved individuals living in different communities, suggesting transmission chains frequently extend beyond local communities in rural Uganda.",

Some viruses are capable of initiating an acute infection that is cleared within days, while other viral infections are chronic and persist for a lifetime. The duration of infection impacts how quickly a virus must be transmitted and has implications for the infectious period and the potential to be transmitted to new hosts. Viruses with long latent periods create interhost phylogenetic trees with longer branch lengths. The long duration between infection and transmission permits accumulation of viral changes through many rounds of viral replication before transmission to the next host.

More traditional compartmental, differential equation models often require simplifying assumptions that limit applicability. Agent-based models have been used to study the spread of viruses in populations as well as the evolution of viruses within and across populations. While agent-based models are intuitive and easy to formulate, these models are often difficult to construct due to the large number of parameters necessary to describe the behavior and interaction between individual units. Commercial frameworks that offer large computational power and intuitive user interphases have also become increasingly available. The Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) on the gleamviz platform (www.gleamviz.com), for example, contains extensive data on populations and human mobility, and allows stochastic simulation of the global spread of infectious diseases using user-defined transmission models.",
