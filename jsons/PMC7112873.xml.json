            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is an acute enteric viral disease of pigs of all ages (Saif and Wesley, 1999). The disease is caused by TGE virus (TGEV), an enveloped virus with a large, single positive-strand RNA genome that belongs to Coronaviridae family. TGEV replicates in intestinal enterocytes and shed in the feces of infected pigs. The infection is transmitted by fecal\u2013oral route. Clinical signs of the disease include watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in unweaned piglets (Saif and Wesley, 1999). TGEV infections can cause severe economic losses to swine industry. Because of the highly contagious nature of TGE, availability of rapid diagnostic methods that are highly specific and sensitive for detection of TGEV in fecal samples is very useful for timely implementation of disease management practices.",

            "text": "Natural mutants of TGEV with deletions in spike (S) gene, known as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), show tropism towards respiratory tissue and cause mild or subclinical respiratory infections (Rasschaert et al., 1990, Kim et al., 2000b). Some pigs infected with PRCV can shed the virus in their feces (Saif and Wesley, 1999, Kim et al., 2000a, Costantini et al., 2004). Therefore, any diagnostic assay for TGE should be able to differentiate it from PRCV. The conventional diagnostic methods used for TGE include, cell culture isolation of the virus, identification of coronavirus in feces by electron microscopy, fluorescent antibody test on cryosections of intestines, antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of TGEV in feces, and detection of serum antibodies to TGEV by virus neutralization assay or ELISA (Dulac et al., 1977, van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988a, van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988b, Sirinarumitr et al., 1997, Saif and Wesley, 1999, Carman et al., 2002). These methods are not suitable for the rapid detection of clinical TGE because of either their low specificity and sensitivity or the prolonged time required to perform the assay. A previously developed nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR) that can differentially detect TGEV and PRCV has been very useful for the diagnostic testing of TGE cases (Kim et al., 2000a). However, this assay is also time-consuming because of the need to perform two PCR amplifications and detect the amplified products by agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition, nested PCR assays are generally more prone to give false positive results because of cross-contamination of the amplified DNA products, especially when processing large number of samples (Aslanzadeh et al., 1996, Bel\u00e1k and Thor\u00e9n, 2001, Khlif et al., 2009).",

Nucleotide sequences of S gene of 15 TGEV strains available in the databases at GenBank (China strain TH-98, AF494337; China strain TS, AY335549; Japan strain TO14, AF302263; Korea strain KT2, AF481360; Russia strain PPS, Y15449; Spain strain NEB72-RT, M94099; Taiwan strain TFI, Z35758; The Netherlands isolate, M21950; UK isolate TGEV FS772/70, X53128; UK strain 96-1933, AF104420; USA isolate BW021898B, AF179882; USA isolate CHV-TGE, U26215; USA strain Miller, S51223; USA strain PUR46-MAD, AJ271965; USA strain Purdue-115, X05695) were retrieved and aligned using ClustalW multiple alignment algorithm (MegAlign program, LaserGene sequence analysis software, DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) to identify the conserved sequences within the region that is absent in S gene of PRCV. A set of primers (forward primer: 5\u2032-TCTGCTGAAGGTGCTATTATATGC-3\u2032; reverse primer: 5\u2032-CCACAATTTGCCTCTGAATTAGAAG-3\u2032) and a TaqMan probe (5\u2032-C/TAAGGGCTCACCACCTACTACCACCA-3\u2032) targeting a conserved 145 bp region (corresponding to the region between nucleotides 370 and 515 of the TGEV S gene open reading frame) were designed using Beacon Designer 3 software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). In silico analysis was performed to confirm the TGEV-specificity of the primers and probe by BLAST search of the nucleotide sequences present in databases at Genbank. The TGEV TaqMan probe contained the fluorescent dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032-end and a non-fluorescent quencher (Black Hole Quencher 1, BHQ1) at the 3\u2032-end.

The EGFP TaqMan probe contained hexachlorofluorescein (HEX) at the 5\u2032-end and BHQ1 at the 3\u2032-end.

In the single-target format assay for detection of TGEV, the EGFP-specific primers, probe and the synthetic RNA template were omitted. In both assay formats, 5 \u03bcl of RNA extracted from samples or serially diluted TGEV RNA or the synthetic transcripts was used as template; DNase- and RNase-free water was used in the no template controls. The amplification parameters were: reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min followed by denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min. Next, 50 cycles of amplification were performed with each cycle containing denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 56 \u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 15 s. The data were acquired during the annealing step and analyzed by using Cepheid Smart Cycler software (version 2.0b). The threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined by primary curve analysis program with the threshold limit set at 30 fluorescent units.",

Presence of PCR inhibitors can lead to false negative results. The TGEV-specific real-time PCR assays reported previously do not detect the presence of PCR inhibitors (Chen et al., 2004, Kim et al., 2007). An effective way to monitor for the presence of PCR inhibitors is to include an internal amplification control in the PCR assay. We employed the EGFP RNA-based universal internal amplification control described previously for this purpose (Hoffmann et al., 2006). The EGFP Ct values in most of the TGEV negative samples were within the expected range, suggesting that RNA extracted from these fecal samples did not contain PCR inhibitors. The EGFP internal amplification control detected the presence of potential PCR inhibitors in RNA of 7 of the TGEV negative samples. In case of TGEV positive samples, the EGFP Ct values were highly variable (in the range of 0\u201335). In samples where the TGEV Ct values were low (<15, indicating high viral concentration in the sample), no amplification of the EGFP internal control occurred (Ct value 0). This could be mainly because of the competitive advantage of the high concentration of the TGEV target sequences for reagent utilization during PCR amplification. On the other hand, the high EGFP Ct values (>29) in the TGEV positive samples suggest the presence of PCR inhibitors; though the relevance of such finding has no effect on the diagnostic interpretation of the sample (i.e. positive for TGEV). In none of the tested samples there was complete inhibition of both the EGFP and TGEV targets, suggesting that the PCR inhibitors present in the fecal RNA extractions were not at high enough levels to cause 100% RT-PCR inhibition. Overall, these results suggest that the developed TaqMan assay can effectively monitor the presence of PCR inhibitors, and along with the RNA extraction method used in this study, the assay provides a reliable means to detect TGEV in the fecal samples.",

            "text": "Six samples were negative for TGEV by the nRT-PCR but were positive by the TaqMan assay. When 1 in 10 dilution (with TE buffer) of the RNA extracted from these samples was used as template in the nRT-PCR, 2 samples with higher viral load (Ct values of 18.82 and 19.21) showed a low level amplification of the specific DNA product; no detectable amplification was observed with the other 4 samples. In addition, even with some positive field samples, only a low level of amplification was detected in the nRT-PCR even though the TGEV Ct values of the same samples indicated very high viral loads. A probable reason for this discrepancy could be that the nRT-PCR was more prone to PCR inhibition than the TaqMan assay, similar to the observations reported for norovirus detection in fecal and environmental samples (Trujillo et al., 2006, Scipioni et al., 2008).",

Compared to the nested RT-PCR assay, the main advantages of the TaqMan assay are the less labor-intensive nature and the rapid turn-around time. Employing the TaqMan assay developed in this study should permit diagnostic laboratories to provide the results of TGE suspect cases within a few hours of receiving the samples. Moreover, the TaqMan assay can also be used for research purposes where rapid quantification of TGEV in fecal or other samples is needed.",
