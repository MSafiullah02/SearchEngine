Yet, the area of adult numeracy is under-researched and faces many challenges. At the same time, this area holds much promise from educational, research, and policy perspectives. This survey paper, together with the 16 papers in this special issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, examines selected topics at the intersection of three broad scholarly areas: numeracy, adult education, and vulnerability, doing so from a lifelong perspective.",

For instance, subgroups in the population may be identified as having low or insufficient numeracy skill levels, which imply a need for further learning or skill upgrading and require relevant or customized educational interventions. Indeed, as reviewed later, large-scale studies show that sizeable proportions of adults and young adults in many countries (including many high-income or developed ones) demonstrate low numeracy (or mathematical literacy).",

After all, in many countries, young people leave schools early on, and enter the adult world or the labor market well before age 18. Many countries are expressing interest in mathematical literacy, which is closely linked with adult numeracy. Hence, some of the insights developed in this paper, and the findings and ideas presented in the other papers in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, will also be of value to educators and researchers interested in mathematics education at the school level, in both STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) and vocational education, and in working with young people and adults deemed vulnerable in such contexts.",

Furthermore, since issues pertaining to the skills, dispositions, and practices of teachers, programs, and learners are influenced by many factors, the paper combines an educationalist lens with a policy or systemic lens.

These adult assessments surveyed people aged 16\u201364.

Parallel developments have occurred in terms of attention to multiple numeracies. An early scheme developed by Steen (1990) outlined five purposes for numeracy: Practical, (focused on mathematical and statistical knowledge and skills that can help to cope with tasks in daily life); Professional (mathematical and statistical skills needed in specific jobs); Civic (data and uses that can benefit society); Recreational (related to the role of mathematical ideas and processes in games, sports, lotteries, and diverse leisure activities); and Cultural (appreciation of mathematical aspects of human culture, such as in artistic artifacts).",

In Australia, the concept of different numeracies was developed from the notion of different literacies mentioned above, and was used in curriculum frameworks for both adults and young people. It centered around four domains (Kindler 1996): Numeracy for practical purposes, Numeracy for interpreting society, Numeracy for personal organization (e.g., money, time, and travel/location), and Numeracy for knowledge, which addressed more formal mathematical skills needed for further study.",

Hence, this term seems more relevant than the well-established domain of financial literacy.Health numeracy is emerging as an independent field in medical and health sciences research, in parallel to continued interest in health literacy (Golbeck et al. 2005).Digital numeracy is becoming increasingly important alongside digital literacy, in times of increasing datafication (Steen 1999), public exposure to big data, and the use of algorithms (Michael and Lupton 2016), and alongside growing opportunities to access open data sets and participate in \u2018citizen science\u2019 initiatives.Civic numeracy is emerging as a complex domain that merges mathematics, statistics, and other areas, and involves critical numeracy (Geiger et al. 2015), statistical literacy (Gal 2002), and civic statistics (ProCivicStat Partners 2018).",

This domain must be addressed explicitly, as an additional fifth numeracy domain, since numeracy (and literacy) practices differ in work contexts compared with other life domains. A review of the many publications on workplace numeracy is beyond the scope of the present paper. Risking oversimplification, however, we can summarize that numeracy tasks that people undertake in many types of workplaces, involve much more than basic arithmetic skills or procedural competence with school-based mathematics. For example, based on an employers' survey, Madison and Steen (2003) found that:Work-related mathematics is rich in data, interspersed with conjecture, dependent on technology, and tied to useful applications. Work contexts often require multi-step solutions to open-ended problems, a high degree of accuracy, and proper regard for required tolerances. None of these features are found in typical classroom exercises (p. 55).",

For numeracy, questions typically inquire, \"how often do you normally\u2026\" followed by a list of activities, such as read invoices, bank statements or similar; read plans, maps or graphs; calculate prices, costs or budgets; calculate using fractions, decimals or percentages; read diagrams, charts or tables; use simple formulas or similar; or use higher level mathematics or statistics.

However, the literature reiterates that as with any competency, numeracy encompasses a set of diverse skills, knowledge-bases, and other building blocks that range from simple to very advanced. Numeracy should, therefore, not be seen as pertaining to simple or basic levels of mathematical knowledge, but as a complex competency.

For many vulnerable adults, functional numeracy is vital and critical.

On the other hand, people who lack certain functional skills do not automatically lack critical awareness. The two are interdependent. It is possible and necessary to be critical even without fully understanding the mathematical part first. For example, in an increasingly technologized age, algorithmic processes of machine learning are black boxes, even for those who produce them (Michael and Lupton 2016). For this reason, there is an emerging need to address both functional and critical aspects of numeracy as part of numeracy and mathematics education.

Although definitions may differ, we summarize them as follows:Formal learning involves learning that is intentional from the learner's perspective, occurs in an organized context created by an institutional actor, and usually leads to a formal credential, diploma, or certificate. Examples include a vocational education course leading to a training qualification, or an adult education program operated by a local educational body that offers courses, possibly including a mathematics course, leading to a high-school equivalency diploma.Non-formal learning is embedded in planned activities that are not explicitly designated as formal education and do not usually involve credentialing, yet still contain a substantial learning element, which is intentional from the learner's point of view. Non-formal learning contexts offer many opportunities for lifelong numeracy learning, as when taking part in counseling to over-indebted persons (Angermeier and Ansen 2020), attending a company workshop or a retirement planning lecture at a community center, or participating in programs for economic empowerment of women or minority groups.Informal learning may occur spontaneously, i.e., learning is usually non-intentional or governed by a structured educational process, but occurs as part of daily activities and is experiential in nature. Indeed, a well-known line of research refers to informal learning of mathematics, as in the literature on everyday cognition or 'street math' (Lave 1988). Several papers in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education discuss related issues regarding numeracy practices, all of which offer opportunities for informal learning.",

            "text": "Many other countries with established adult education systems show a similar fragmentation of adult education learning schemes and diversity in the demands for teacher qualification in mathematics and numeracy. For instance:In the USA, a country with close to four million learners in federally-funded adult education programs, an early national survey (Gal and Schuh 1994) found that 85% of adult numeracy instructors were part-time; fewer than 5% of teachers in programs providing numeracy education were certified to teach mathematics, and few had received any pre-service training in mathematics instruction. Later on, Condelli et al. (2006) confirmed this picture. Smith and Gillespie (2007) summarized the characteristics of adult basic education teachers in the USA as follows: they work mostly part-time, they leave the field more often than do school teachers, few have formal qualifications in teaching adults, though many are qualified and have taught in K-12, and they are not consistently funded to participate in in-service professional development.In the UK, a review of the professional development and qualifications of adult educators revealed the inconsistent and poor background of teachers and the lack of systematic professional development opportunities (Morton et al. 2006).Going beyond Germany, USA, and the UK, an OECD comparative review about the background, experience, and knowledge of adult literacy and numeracy teachers shows a consistent pattern across many different European countries (Windisch 2016): Few teaching staff have formal qualifications in adult literacy and numeracy pedagogy.",

That said, second-chance schools, which provide basic qualifications to adults who have had little formal schooling (e.g., due to being migrants or refugees) and seek school completion certificates, often do teach mathematics as a separate subject, but following the standard curriculum for school students (Pavic and \u010cernja 2019). Furthermore, going beyond formal education to non-formal numeracy education, little is known about the content provided in in-house training that companies or worker unions provide for their employees or members, nor about teacher qualifications in such contexts (Kelly 2019).",

Yet, the essence of vulnerability is also that it has an empirical aspect, i.e., it refers to the possibility and probability of getting hurt, where some members of a society are better protected than others from actually getting hurt, as revealed by empirical data (e.g., official statistics or comparative studies).

For example, one can be included and function well in one area (e.g. family life) yet be vulnerable in other areas (e.g. housing). Vulnerability should therefore not be seen as a stigmatizing term, but be defined as a continuum that extends from comfortable interrelatedness (given the feminist idea of vulnerability as a normal human condition) through more precarious social positions or increasing risk of exclusion. The other end of the continuum would be the factual exclusion, e.g., long-term unemployment, which gradually leads to complete dropping out of the formal labor market.

This term represents the degree to which individuals have the ability to access, process, interpret, communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical, bio-statistical, and probability-based health information (Golbeck et al. 2005). Descriptions from qualitative data (Zeuner et al. 2020) on elderly adults indicate that health-oriented activities demand numeracy practices, e.g., probability checks (chances of recovery and risks of an operation), scaled self-observations (pain protocols), dosage tasks, or expenses and bonuses claimed from health insurers. Large-scale data confirm the relevance of health numeracy to adults' well-being. Based on a longitudinal study (PIAAC-L), Heilmann (2020) showed a relationship between aspects of health-related behavior (non-smoking, exercise, health-conscious nutrition) and basic numerical practices such as estimating measurements and calculating simple averages, as well as more complex numerical practices such as the interpretation of statistical data.",

Grotl\u00fcschen et al. (2019b) show that complex financial decisions (retirement plans, tax returns) are less likely to be made by low-literate adults, while numeracy practices of over-indebted people (Grotl\u00fcschen et al. 2019a) involve the intense use of finance-oriented numeracy practices and skills.

New challenges range from understanding ubiquitous data collection, algorithmic decision making, and uses of 'big data' in prediction systems (Michael and Lupton 2016). Citizens need to understand the potential contribution of such developments to inequality or discriminatory use, e.g., health insurance based on the probability of an improved situation (Smythe 2018), and to distinguish advertisements from information and understand disinformation (European Commission 2018). Zuboff\u2019s (2019) recent theory on surveillance capitalism calls for critical awareness of how human behavior is predicted and modified based on personal data to benefit leading internet companies. The upshot is that citizens who do not develop digital numeracy and a critical stance in this regard are vulnerable, e.g., to actions by various service providers.",

Examples of research-worthy questions include, but are not limited to the following broad topics:1. What is the impact of dispositional and affective factors (broadly viewed, including attitudes, purposes and motivations for learning, beliefs, identity, etc), which may have both negative and positive aspects, on participation, retention, persistence, and engagement by learners of numeracy?2. What are the numeracy practices (both productive and unproductive) of vulnerable groups (several subtypes were described in this paper) and how should such practices be considered when planning and implementing instruction?3. What teaching (and assessment) practices can promote the teaching and learning of critical aspects of numeracy, and what is the role of new technologies in this regard?4. What content knowledge (CK) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) are required by teachers in the area of adult numeracy, and what professional development schemes can promote such knowledge?5. What curricula or teaching practices can enhance literacy-numeracy linkages, i.e., enable learners to effectively engage with the literacy aspects of numeracy?6. Since learning of numeracy and numeracy practices occur in many non-formal as well as informal life contexts (e.g., health, financial, digital, civic, workplace), to what extent are the skills and dispositions that adults bring from such contexts recognized and capitalized on by teachers, curricula, and teaching practices in formal numeracy education programs?",

This paper highlights the fact that the roles and purposes of adult numeracy are complex, yet are becoming more multifaceted and dynamic in a rapidly changing twenty-first century. Thus, the conceptualization of the numeracy skills and practices that adults need should be continuously monitored and adjusted by policy bodies, researchers, and practitioners involved in adult learning and skills, and no less so by those interested in mathematics and statistics education in schools, STEM, and vocational contexts.",
