            "text": "The contribution of natural products to anti-viral chemotherapy, however, has been more modest. Several factors have contributed to this scenario. Viral infections like the common cold are self limited and require only symptomatic treatment. Public health measures like vector control have succeeded in controlling vector transmitted infections. Similarly, development of effective vaccines has played a major role in eliminating diseases like small pox, near eradication of poliomyelitis and treatment of rabies. A major reason for limited input from Indian plants has been the non-availability of strict containment facility needed for such work at most institutions in the country. A large number of plants found in India have, therefore been investigated and found active in Japan, South Korea, US, etc. Data on all such plants also has been included in the present review along with analysis of data generated within the country. Plants active in viruses closely related to human virus [e.g. feline Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or duck hepatitis] have also been included. Maximum plants have been screened against Ranikhet disease (RNA) virus (RDV) and vaccinia (DNA virus) followed by herpes, HIV and hepatitis. The data in following sections has been arranged in the same order.",

The program has used 50% ethanolic extracts of botanically authenticated plant samples. The extracts have been screened in vitro against one RNA virus (Ranikhet disease virus) and one DNA virus (vaccinia virus). Some samples have also been screened against encephalomyocarditis (EMCV), Japanese Encephalitis B (JE) and Semiliki Forest (SFV) viruses. Extracts showing high degree of activity were fractionated according to a standardized protocol to localize activity in one or more fractions. The results of testing 3,789 samples from 3,482 plants belonging to 233 families have been reported in a series of publications [3\u201314]. In addition, 967 of these plants were also tested for interferon-like activity against RD and vaccinia viruses [15]. A mid-term review of the work has also been published [16]. Antiviral activity was observed in 242 samples belonging to 96 families. The results have been summarized in Table 1. The plants have been listed under the appropriate families which have been arranged alphabetically. It also indicates plants where activity has been confirmed further in fractions or those exhibiting anticancer activity also.\n",

Clearance of viraemia in infective hepatitis, the commonest hepatic disorder, became an important parameter after the demonstration of carrier stage and possible induction of malignancy in such persons. One of the earliest demonstrations of viral clearance was provided by the pioneering studies of Thyagarajan et al. [106] with Phyllanthus amarus. This led to screening of large number of plants for activity against the virus. The availability of the duck model for in vivo studies materially facilitated these studies. Protective effect has been reported with 17 Indian plants belonging to 14 families. These have been listed in Table 4.

An analysis of the results has shown that each particular activity was preferentially observed in certain families. The top 11 families for anti-viral activity and three other major activities have been arranged in rank order in Table 8. It will be observed that rank order is different for different activities even though some families exhibit more than one type of activity. The top 11 families in each case contain 35\u201345% of the plants for the concerned activity. The 11 families identified for anti-viral activity contain about 41% of the 242 active plants from 96 families. About 27% plants reported active against other viruses and included in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 also belong to these 11 families. It should be useful to screen other plants of these families to obtain more active plants. It will be evident from data in Tables 1 and 8 that many plants and families have both anti-viral and anticancer properties. It may be mentioned also that several smaller countries like Egypt [39], Nepal [43], Sudan [54] and Togo [27] have undertaken systematic evaluation of their flora for anti-viral activity following the lead given by CDRI.\n",

            "text": "Activity has also been reported in certain compounds which have undergone extensive clinical evaluation in non-viral diseases. Their available safety and dosage regimen data would help in initiating clinical evaluation in viral infection where in vitro or in vivo activity data is available. Andrographolide is a potent hepatoprotective agent [114] besides being active against herpes [30], influenza and H1N1 infections [116]. Dehydroandrographolide succinic acid monoester is active against HIV [143]. Another clinically authenticated hepatoprotective agent Picroliv [23] is also active against several viral infections including hepatitis B [24\u201326]. Curcumin has received the maximum attention after its activity against HIV was demonstrated. Large number of semi-synthetic or synthetic derivatives have been prepared and tested for anti-HIV activity. Its boron complexes; semi-synthetic reduced curcumin, allyl curcumin and tocopheryl-curcumin and synthetic analogues dicafferoyl methane and rosemarinic acid are highly active against HIV in a variety of in vitro protocols. Curcumin is active against herpes simplex 2 in a mouse model and Human papilloma and Epstein Barr viruses in vitro. These activities have been reviewed recently by Krishnaswamy [136]. Its in vitro activity against Friends leukaemia [25], Newcastle and Poliomyelitis viruses [120] has also been reported. Fiore et al. [41] in a recent review have provided reference for activity of glycyrrhizin and its analogues against herpes, hepatitis (including clinical trial), influenza, respiratory syncytial, SARS and vesicular stomatitis viruses. Other investigators have found it active against Japanese encephalitis [137], poliomyelitis [138], vaccinia and varicella [130]. It perhaps has the widest spectrum of antiviral activity among the natural products so far investigated. Adequate clinical evaluation is necessary to assess its role in treatment of viral disorders. Azadirachta indica also is a promising plant, even though most of the studies have used its extract. It has a variety of compounds and also has a long history of use in traditional medicine in many countries of the world. The viruses against which the extracts or some of the isolated compounds have shown activity include chikungunya, fowl pox, measles, vaccinia [128], buffalo pox [127], Coxsackie [134] and herpes [32]. Detailed studies against some of these viruses, specially herpes and chikungunya are strongly warranted. In conclusion it may be stated that the rich and valuable resource of Indian plants needs to be more extensively exploited to provide new drugs for the treatment of viral disorders.",
