Colostrometers have high specificity, but low sensitivity, resulting in samples being falsely classified as high quality. There are several factors such as fat content, other solids and temperature that may also affect colostrometer readings.19, 20 The Brix refractometer provides an acceptable estimate of IgG in first\u2010milking bovine colostrum and can be easily carried out cow\u2010side.21 A potential limitation to using a Brix refractometer to measure colostrum quality is that colostrum with a high fat content may result in a wide band of colour transitioning (from blue to white) when reading the Brix refractometer.21\n",
