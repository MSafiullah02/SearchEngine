With the successful estimation of key epidemiological parameters affecting epidemic dynamics of transmission, appropriate public health interventions were promptly formulated and implemented on a global basis that ultimately brought the epidemic under control; by July 5, 2003, WHO declared the recovery of the last patient and the successful interruption of the chain of SARS transmission in humans.",

The remaining palm civets in the restaurant and in a live animal market that supplied civets to the restaurant were later shown to harbor SARS-CoV that shared near identical nucleotide sequences of the S genes as that detected in specimens collected from some of the patients.7, 8, 9 Following the reemergence of human SARS cases in the winter of 2003\u20132004, Chinese authorities once again banned trading of live civets in markets, as well as culling all the infected civets in farms, as an attempt to prevent further interspecies transmission to humans. These cases resulted in no grave epidemic impact and provided an opportunity for detailed investigation into an interspecies jump of animal viruses into the human population. It served as a reminder that naturally existing SARS-CoV-like virus may reemerge to cause outbreaks in human populations when given the opportune setting of transmission via interspecies jumping, mutation, and adaptation of the virus to the new host.",

Furthermore, a general absence of antibodies against SARS-CoV among palm civets raised in the farms supplying animals to the markets further corroborates the theory of a wet market-perpetuated transmission of SARS-CoV.4, 20, 21 Subsequently, several SARS-CoV-like viruses, sharing 88\u201392% nucleotide homology with that of the human SARS-CoV, were detected in species of Chinese horseshoe bats existing in the wild in Hong Kong and southern China.5, 6 These findings culminated in adding SARS-CoV to the long list of viruses that are naturally harbored in a variety of bat species, i.e., rabies, Hendra, Nipha, Ebola, and St Louis encephalitis viruses. Apart from Himalaya palm civets and bats, many other mammalian animal species have also tested positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting a promiscuous nature of SARS-CoV in hosts and the ability for host adaptation (Fig. 59.2) (see reference 22 for detailed review).",

Through contact in a Hong Kong hotel, 10 guests were infected. The subsequent movements of these international travelers effectively spread the virus outside China where the patients sought medical care and large-scale nosocomial outbreaks ensued (Fig. 59.1).",

Mathematical modeling of the early phase, based on the epidemiological data collected before the implementation of any control measures when transmission was occurring mainly in the hospital setting, estimated the R\n0 to be 2.2\u20133.7.27, 28 The spread of SARS illustrates two important stages of disease transmission in the modern era: the first stage of the long-distance spread via international travelers and the second stage of establishing the chain of local transmission at each local epicenter. The R\n0 must be >1 in order for the disease to establish sustainable local transmission. However, a highly heterogeneous potential of transmission from individual index cases is usually observed, i.e., a \u201csuperspreading event,\u201d which entails an index case capable of infecting multiple household members and health care workers in both social/family and hospital settings, and these \u201csuperspreading events\u201d most often serve to ignite subsequent explosive SARS outbreaks at the local site. The attack rate for SARS-CoV ranges from 10.3% to 60% or 2.4 to 31.3 cases/1000 exposure-hours, depending on the setting and the unit of measurement.25 The overall case-fatality rate was ~15%, but can be as high as 60% in elderly patients with a high virus load.29\n",

Virus isolation is not routinely carried out for SARS-CoV in the clinical setting as it requires a high containment laboratory for biosafety and biosecurity considerations. Instead, detecting viral nucleic acids based on primers of various segments of the viral genome by conventional RT-PCR or by quantitative RT-PCR is routinely used as the standard diagnostic method. With optimized RNA extraction methods and applying quantitative real-time RT-PCR techniques, the sensitivity for diagnosis of SARS in the first 3 days of disease is as high as 80% when nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were tested,64 which is a tremendous improvement when compared with the generally low detection rate by conventional RT-PCR during the first week of illness. In a longitudinal follow-up study of 20 SARS patients with detectable nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV virus by RT-PCR, the virus load increased from day 5 to day 10 and decreased by day 15 of illness.32 On day 14 of illness, the sensitivity of detection in urine, nasophargyngeal aspirate, and stool specimens is 42%, 68%, and 97%, respectively.32\n",
