Specifically, it is unclear what social isolation actions must be mandated by government policy to reach desired mitigation outcomes. 3 In response to the rising death toll associated with COVID-19, 42 states and the District of Columbia have implemented some variation of a state-wide stay-at-home order. In each case, there was controversy regarding the appropriateness of the order, and it is widely understood that these decisions incur human and economic costs. 4 In the current analysis, we present data from the states with stay-at-home orders and examine the effect of these policies on the rate of increase in COVID-19 diagnoses.",

Eight states without state-wide stay-at-home orders were excluded from this analysis. For the pre-and post-order sets, slopes were calculated from both raw and logged case count data using linear regression techniques and R2 fit statistics were obtained. As expected, R2 fits were substantially better for the logged data and this approach was used throughout the analysis. 95% confidence intervals were obtained for all parameters. Meta-analytic techniques were used to combine data across states using the METAN command suite in Stata. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the same linear regression and meta-analytic approach to determine whether delaying the days counted as post-order by one week would impact the infection rates and R2 fit statistics. Table 1 displays the dates stay-at-home orders went into effect as well as logged, pre-order and post-order slopes and 95% confidence intervals for all 42 states and the District of Columbia. R2 fit statistics are also shown. In general, the fit of the slopes to the logged data is excellent, as would be expected from an exponentially growing pandemic in a naive population. The average rate of increase pre-order was 0.113 (95% C.I.: 0.110, 0.115) per day and post-order was 0.047 (95% C.I.: 0.045, 0.048) per day. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a major limitation of this work is the endogenous relationship between case counts and both the availability and use of testing. The availability of testing was a significant barrier to COVID-19 diagnoses in the early stages of the pandemic in the U.S. and improved gradually over the month of March. Tests per day increased roughly tenfold between March 15th and March 31st and have increased at a more gradual rate of fourfold over the last six weeks. 6 We conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to examine whether the decrease in case incidence between pre-and post-order periods was different if the order occurred before or after April 1st and found the change in slopes to be nearly identical. As mentioned earlier, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to account for the effect of time on these slopes and found no effect. Overall, the results must be interpreted in the context of this threat. Not only was the availability of tests evolving over this time period, but there is a direct relationship between the number of infections and public awareness of the pandemic and the number of tests performed. As such, it would be difficult to begin to parse out the effect of testing on the rate of incidence of COVID-19. That said, it is likely that the availability of tests may have an unmeasured impact on these results, but we cannot know if the impact was to increase or decrease the incidence rates. Despite these limitations, the consistency and strength of the results is notable. The results presented here will be updated daily and available for public download at www.hpmcovidpolicy.org.",

In this sensitivity analysis, the pooled standardized mean difference was 4.229 (95% C.I.: 4.011, 4.448; p<0.0001) after weighing by number of days and was 6.811 (95% C.I.: 6.798, 6.824; p<0.0001) after weighing by final number of cases.DiscussionThese data suggest a remarkably consistent and important effect associated with the issuing of stay-at-home orders and are generally supportive of such measures. In combination with other social isolation approaches and NPIs, these orders may play a significant role in \"flattening the curve.\" However, this study has a number of important limitations. First, it would be impossible to isolate the effect of these orders against the background of numerous other local, state, and federal interventions occurring at the same time. Second, the expected COVID-19 expansion curve in the absence of interventions to reduce the transmission is unknown. As such, it is possible that the observed slope changes are driven by the natural history of the pandemic as well as the specific policies in question. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether the number of days in the pre-and post-periods were drivers of either the slopes or the change in the slopes between periods. In both cases, we found no relationship. Third, states implemented stay-at-home orders in response to the pandemic and these observations are thus profoundly threatened by selection and indication biases. Fourth, even with the use of trend data in this analysis, there is a threat of regression to the mean if stay-at-home orders were consistently placed at the peak of epidemic growth.",
