            "text": "The dual-functional plasmonic performances were systematically studied in the aspects of\nLSPR sensing transduction and PPT heating. The common-path differential phase-sensitive LSPR\nsystem, as shown in Figure 1a, was adopted to\nmeasure the local refractive index changes or the binding events. In the LSPR sensing\ntransduction unit, the sensing beam was generated by a wide spectrum LED source and operated\nin the ATR (attenuated total reflection) mode at the interface between the glass substrate\nand liquid environment. When reaching the two-dimensional AuNI sensing layer, the measured\noptical power of the beam was found to be 32.58 \u03bcW. The local plasmonic responses were\nretrieved from the ATR spectral interferograms by using the windowed Fourier transform phase\nextraction method, as described elsewhere.30 This phase response,\nreported in radian units, is more prominent than the conventional spectral and angular\nresponses. Therefore, it has been utilized for improving the sensitivity of plasmonic\nsensors.31 In order to generate a stable and intense thermoplasmonic\nfield, an excitation laser with 532 nm peak wavelength and 40 mW maximum optical power was\napplied onto the AuNI chip in the normal incident angle (Figure 1b). In addition, optimizing the AuNI chip so that its peak absorbance\nwavelength was exactly at 532 nm can significantly improve the conversion efficiency of\nthermoplasmonic. By adjusting the Au nanofilm thickness before dewetting, the absorption\npeak (under normal incident angle) can be accurately controlled within a wavelength range\nfrom 523.4 to 539.7 nm as shown in Figure 1c,d and\nFigure S1. In this work, the AuNIs that matched the laser excitation\nwavelength at 532.2 nm (\u00b10.2 nm) were utilized for the PPT heating.32 It is worth noting that under the ATR conditions with a 72\u00b0 inclined incident angle\nthe plasmonic resonance wavelength for LSPR sensing transduction red-shifted to 580 nm due\nto the prism coupling and the inclined angle of incidence (Figure 1e).30 The phase changes caused by a local\nvariation of LSPR conditions were confined in a narrow wavelength region from 578 to 582 nm.\nMoreover, after addition of a long-pass filter (LPF) with a cut-on wavelength at 552 nm, the\n532 nm photothermal excitation laser from the PPT unit did not influence the stability of\nthe real-time LSPR sensing transduction.",

Conversely, the PPT-induced temperature increase was also\nresponsible for a refractive index variation of the surrounding environment, which can be\nin situ detected by the LSPR detection system as shown in Figure 2a. Specifically, the AuNI chip was exposed to\nlaser excitation for 50 s, as indicated by the shaded region. Then the laser was switched\noff to reattain the baseline. The generation and equilibrium of local photothermal heating\nwere relatively fast. According to the laser switching tests as shown in Figure S2, the rapid heating process was completed within 1 s after turning on\nthe laser excitation. Subsequently, the dynamic equilibrium process took another 11 s before\nfinally entering the steady state. In our experiments, we calibrated the LSPR phase response\nunder different ambient temperatures. The in situ temperature arising from\nthe PPT effect was characterized based on the measurement of the thermal-induced refractive\nindex variation in the vicinity of AuNIs.32,34 During the ambient temperature variation, the real-time\nLSPR phase responses and temperature values were recorded in parallel (Figure 2b), and the correlation was established as shown in Figure 2c. Based on this calibrated LSPR-temperature\nregression, the localized photothermal temperatures under different laser powers were\nretrieved as shown in Figure 2d.",

According to the WHO guideline and local alignment searching results, two specific\nsequences from SARS-CoV-2 were selected, i.e., the RdRp and the ORF1ab as\nshown in Figure 3a.

The\nimpacts of the localized thermoplasmonic heating on nucleic acids hybridization and LSPR\ndetection were systematically studied. According to the temperature profile shown in Figure 2f, the excited PPT heat with approximately 41\n\u00b0C nominal temperature was generated on the AuNI sensor. Before the injection of the\nRdRp sequence, nuclease-free water was flown across the microfluidic sensing chamber and the\nthermoplasmonic laser (32 mW) was turned on to establish a steady phase reference and\nbaseline. According to the phase-sensing diagram in Figure 4b and S6a, the LSPR response of the dual-functional AuNI biosensor started to\nincrease when the RdRp-COVID genes were injected into the microfluidic chamber at about 200\ns and attained the maximum phase value after about 800 s hybridization. The dual-functional\nAuNI sensing chip was further flushed with nuclease-free water to remove the nonspecific\nbinding items and to check the final LSPR phase response. In the comparison with and without\nthe PPT effect, the hybridization rate and the LSPR sensing response level were obviously\nsuppressed when the PPT unit was shut down as shown in Figure 4b. It proved that the localized photothermal effect can significantly\nimprove the hybridization kinetics of the RdRp-COVID and its cDNA. Thus, the response-slope\nof the photothermal enhanced LSPR was much steeper than that without the photothermal\nassistance.

SARS-CoV\nand SARS-CoV-2 viruses are similar \u03b2-coronavirus, and their genetic similarities are\nhigh. The specific SARS-CoV-2 genetic target recommended by the WHO, i.e.,\nthe RdRp-COVID sequence as shown in Table S1, is very closely related to that of SARS-CoV. Specifically, in the\nselected gene sequences, only three fixed nucleotide bases were different between RdRp-COVID\nand RdRp-SARS. A real-time LSPR detection was conducted on the two closely related\nsequences. The LSPR sensor without the aid of photothermal unit reported a false positive\nresponse signal when detecting the RdRp-SARS sequence (Figure S7), which indicated that a similar but not fully complement sequence\nwas also able to interact and partially hybridize with the cDNA receptors at room\ntemperature. Although the hybridization kinetics of RdRp-SARS sequence from SARS-CoV was\nclearly slower than that of SARS-CoV-2, the nonmatching spurious binding of any closely\nrelated sequence can affect the accurate virus detection and discrimination. Therefore, the\nlocal heat based on the proposed PPT effect was employed to improve the specificity of\nhybridization. At the elevated temperature of 41 \u00b0C as illustrated in Figure 4d, the standard free energy of hybridization was weaker\ndue to the mismatched base-pairs. Thus, the similar but not fully matched sequences of\nSARS-CoV can be distinguished. In detail, the calculated association rate constant\nka of RdRp-COVID with PPT heating enhancement was found to be\n1.11 \u00d7 106 M\u20131 s\u20131. A detailed\ndiscussion and calculations are given in Figure S6c. For a typical biological sensing system,\nka ranges between 103 and 107\nM\u20131 s\u20131 and a higher associate rate indicates a\nstronger binding affinity.36,37 In a comparison experiment including the PPT heat with 32 mW optical\npower, the 532 nm laser was applied onto the surface of the AuNI sensor from 200 to 700 s as\nshown in Figure 4e. The local PPT heat was\ngenerated immediately to make the LSPR phase jump to about 1.76 rad. After turning off the\nlaser at 700 s, the LSPR phase response of the mismatching RdRp-SARS gene was fully\nsuppressed to the ground state of blank measurement (i.e., the responses\nfrom 0 to 200 s) as shown by the black curve in Figure 4e. Since the RdRp-SARS sequences reported a weak response of 0.002 rad, we\ndetermined that its association rate constant was lower than 103\nM\u20131 s\u20131 under the PPT heating. At the same time, the\nfully matching RdRp-COVID sequence from SARS-CoV-2, showed an apparent phase difference\nbefore and after the laser excitation (orange curve in Figure 4e). Thus, we believed that a similar but not fully matched sequence\ncould be distinguished based on their different binding affinity and the PPT heating.",

The AuNI sensing system started to\nattain the saturation condition when the concentration of the RdRp-COVID sequence reached 1\n\u03bcM. In contrast, the low RdRp-COVID concentration, i.e., 0.1 pM, only\nresulted in a weak phase response by 2.90 \u00d7 10\u20133 radian (Figure 5b), which was close to the system blank\nmeasurement of 2.92 \u00d7 10\u20133 radian. Thus, as illustrated in the\nsensing calibration curve in Figure 5b, the\ndual-functional LSPR sensing system exhibited a limit of the range from 0.1 pM to 1 \u03bcM\nfor detecting oligonucleotides, covering 7 orders of magnitude. The calibrated regression\ncurve was further used to estimate the limit of detection (LoD), which is defined by IUPAC\n(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) as the sum of the blank measures,\ni.e., 2.92 \u00d7 10\u20133 radian with the nuclease-free\nwater buffer and triple of its standard deviation (Figure S9). Thus, the LoD of the photothermal enhanced LSPR sensing system was\nfound to be (2.92 \u00d7 10\u20133) + 3 \u00d7 (3.12 \u00d7\n10\u20133) = 0.0123 rad as shown by the dashed line in Figure 5b. Therefore, the detectable RdRp-COVID sequence\nconcentration corresponding to the systematic LoD was about 0.22 \u00b1 0.08 pM (Figure S9). A 200 \u03bcL analyte solution at this LoD concentration\ncontained about 2.26 \u00d7 107 copies of the RdRp-COVID sequence. The actual\nsize of SARS-CoV-2 is about 29.9 kilobases in length, which is 1000 times longer than the\nRdRp-COVID sequence used in this study. Thus, based on the LSPR signal\u2013target size\nrelationship, the estimated LoD for detecting the entire RNA strands from SARS-CoV-2 could\nbe approximately 2.26 \u00d7 104 copies.38 A recent study\nreported the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from different respiratory trace samples including\nthe throat/nasal swabs and the sputum. Based on these clinical specimens collected from 82\ninfected individuals, the overall viral load soon after onset was higher than 1 \u00d7\n106 copies/mL.39 This indicated that our proposed\ndual-functional LSPR system has the potential for direct analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in\nrespiratory samples.",
