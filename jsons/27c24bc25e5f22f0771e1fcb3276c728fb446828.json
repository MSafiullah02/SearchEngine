            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection can manifest as a mild illness, acute respiratory distress, organ failure, or death. Several animal models have been established to study disease pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and therapeutic agents. Here, we developed transgenic (Tg) mice on a C57BL/6 background; these mice expressed human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, under the control of an endogenous hDPP4 promoter. We then characterized this mouse model of MERS-CoV. The expression profile of hDPP4 in these mice was almost equivalent to that in human tissues, including kidney and lung; however, hDPP4 was overexpressed in murine CD3positive cells within peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Intranasal inoculation of young and adult Tg mice with MERS-CoV led to infection of the lower respiratory tract and pathological evidence of acute multifocal interstitial pneumonia within 7 days, with only transient loss of body weight. However, the immunopathology in young and adult Tg mice was different. On day 5 or 7 postinoculation, lungs of adult Tg mice contained higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with migration of macrophages. These results suggest that the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection in the Tg mouse is age dependent. The mouse model described here will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and host mediators that protect against MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are endemic in the Middle East and a threat to public health worldwide. Rodents are not susceptible to the virus because they do not express functional receptors; therefore, we generated a new animal model of MERS-CoV infection based on transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4). The pattern of hDPP4 expression in this model was similar to that in human tissues (except lymphoid tissue). In addition, MERS-CoV was limited to the respiratory tract. Here, we focused on host factors involved in immunopathology in MERS-CoV infection and clarified differences in antiviral immune responses between young and adult transgenic mice. This new small-animal model could contribute to more in-depth study of the pathology of MERS-CoV infection and aid development of suitable treatments.",

            "text": "M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was originally isolated as a novel coronavirus from a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure in 2012 (1). A human receptor for the virus, called human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), was identified subsequently (2) . Many epidemiological and virological investigations have been undertaken since then; however, information about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is limited. In addition, because MERS-CoV is endemic in the Middle East, the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment strategies remains a high priority. Therefore, appropriate animal models are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and facilitate development of effective vaccines and drugs. Some research groups experimentally infected nonhuman primates and small experimental animals with MERS-CoV (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Rhesus macaques appear to develop a transient lower respiratory tract infection after a combination of intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal inoculation with MERS-CoV (3), whereas the common marmoset develops progressive and severe pneumonia, which can be lethal (4) . However, animal models based on nonhuman primates present both ethical and economic problems. Thus, establishing a small-animal model of MERS-CoV infection is desirable. Unfortunately, MERS-CoV does not infect or replicate in small rodents such as Syrian hamsters (8) , mice (9) , or rats (10) because they lack a functional MERS-CoV receptor. Zhao et al. described lung infection in a mouse model transduced with an adenovirus expressing hDPP4 (11) ; thus, a transgenic (Tg) mouse carrying hDPP4 should be suitable for MERS-CoV studies (5) . Some research groups developed Tg mice overexpressing the hDPP4 receptor under the control of CAG or cytokeratin 18 promoters (5) (6) (7) . These mice developed severe lung disease, along with infection of the brain. Autopsy data are available from only one MERS patient; therefore, it is unclear whether MERS-CoV causes a systemic infection although there is no evidence that MERS-CoV infects the human brain. Other studies describe development of an hDPP4 knock-in mouse (12) (13) (14) . Although the tissue distribution and expression levels of hDPP4 in these models are largely equivalent to those of DPP4 in wild-type mice, the phenotype that determines MERS-CoV susceptibility varies from model to model. The hDPP4 knock-in mouse model described by Coleman et al. (12) succumbed to infection with wild-type MERS-CoV. In contrast, model mice described by Cockrell et al. (14) and Li et al. (13) are susceptible to infection by serially passaged MERS-CoV, which induces severe lung pathology and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). These mice would be good models for studying pathogenesis of MERS. Here, we developed a new Tg mouse model expressing hDPP4 under the control of its endogenous promoter to better mimic physiological expression of hDPP4. These Tg mice were then backcrossed onto Th1prone C57BL/6 mice. After evaluating susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection, we investigated age-dependent differences in disease pathogenesis because older age is one of the common factors related to MERS severity and mortality (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Both young and adult Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV showed transient weight loss along with moderate pneumonia and MERS-CoV replication in the lung; however, they did not recapitulate the severe disease and lethal infection seen in humans. Young and adult Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV did, however, show different immunopathologies. Adult Tg mice showed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine-and chemokinemediated macrophage infiltration of the lungs than young Tg mice. Taken together, these results suggest that age affects the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection in Tg mice. The data suggest that other factors are required to recapitulate severe human disease in these Tg mice; however, this mouse model will be useful for identifying host mediators that protect against MERS-CoV infection. This animal model will provide new insight into factors that cause severe MERS-CoV infection.",

To screen the Tg mice generated, we confirmed presence of the transgene by PCR genotyping using two primers sets specific for hDPP4 (Table 1, exons  3 and 10) . hDPP4 is a protease expressed on the surface of cells in various organs, including T cells (24, 25) . The enzyme is expressed by approximately 60% of resting T cells isolated from blood (26) .

CD3-positive lymphocytes from 2/15 tested pups were positive for hDPP4.

While hDPP4 expression was undetectable in brain tissue by Western blot analysis, IHC revealed that endothelial cells lining blood vessels and leptomeninges of the human brain were positive for hDPP4 although neurons and glia were negative. In Tg2 mice, pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells in the lungs, bile capillaries in the liver, the renal tubular epithelium, and the surface of epithelial cells in the small intestine were positive for hDPP4 (Fig. 2B ). In addition, several types of endothelial cells and serous membranes in all tested tissues, including the central nervous system, from Tg2 mice were positive for hDPP4. Notably, most lymphocytes in the T cell zones of the spleen and lymph nodes from Tg2 mice were positive for hDPP4. Staining of tissues from non-Tg mice was very weak or absent (except for the small intestine) (Fig. 2B) . These data suggest that the pattern of hDPP4 expression in Tg2 mice is similar to that in humans (except for pancreas and lymphoid tissues). Expression of hDPP4 was higher in lymphocytes from Tg2 mice than in those from humans ( Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B ). Therefore, we investigated the immune response profile in Tg2 mice. To assess innate immune responses in the lungs of Tg2, non-Tg, and C57BL/6 mice, all animals received intranasal administration of PBS with or without (B) Immunohistochemical analysis of hDPP4 expression in human, Tg2, and non-Tg mouse tissues stained with an anti-hDPP4 polyclonal antibody. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

There was no statistically significant difference in cytokine expression levels between Tg2, non-Tg, and C57BL/6 mice at 24 h after inoculation with poly(I\u00b7C) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Fig. 3) . However, when we set expression levels after PBS treatment as 1, we noted that expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u2423 (MIP-1\u2423), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424), IL-12, and IL-2 in poly(I\u00b7C)treated Tg2 mice was 0.8-to 2-fold higher than in the other two strains. These results suggest that hDPP4 expression in mice does not have a marked effect on basal innate immune responses in the three mouse strains; however, Tg2 mice show slightly stronger or earlier innate immune responses than C57BL/6 mice and non-Tg mice. Thus, when we investigated immune responses in this animal model, we made comparisons between MERS-CoV-infected and noninfected Tg mice.",

MERS-CoV infection of the nasal cavity, lungs, brain, spinal cord, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and gastrointestinal tract of Tg2 mice was examined histopathologically on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 35 p.i (n \u03ed 3; one or two females and one or two males per time point). Histopathological investigations revealed that Tg2 mice showed progressive pulmonary inflammation associated with acute virus infection, from which they recovered (Fig. 5 ). On day 1 p.i., there was no obvious infiltration of the lungs in Tg2 mice; however, mild cellular degeneration and viral antigen-positive cells were seen in the bronchioles and a few alveolar areas ( Fig. 5A to C). Double-immunofluorescence staining revealed that MERS-CoV antigen colocalized with hDPP4-positive bronchioles and alveolar cells on day 1 p.i. (Fig. 6 ). On days 3 and 5 p.i., inflammatory reactions, including partial and/or mild perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltration by mononuclear cells and eosinophils in response to viral antigens, were observed in alveolar areas of lung tissue from Tg2 mice (Fig. 5D to I). From day 3 p.i. onwards, the alveolar area was the main site of inflammatory responses to viral replication (Fig. 5F , I, and L). On day 7 p.i., the point at which Tg2 mice showed weight loss, there was evidence of severe lung inflammation, including perivascular and alveolar septal thickening, caused by infiltrating mononuclear cells; some alveoli were positive for viral antigens (Fig. 5K ). At day 14 p.i., focal cellular infiltration was still evident in the peribronchioles and alveolar septa although viral antigens and inflammatory responses had cleared from the lungs by day 35 p.i. (Fig. 5M to P). There was no evidence of diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs up to day 35 p.i. These findings suggest that progressive immunopathology occurred uniformly throughout the lungs but resolved within 14 days after infection. Neither histopathology nor IHC detected inflammatory infiltration or viral antigens in the nasal cavity through 35 days p.i. In addition, there was no inflammation or viral antigen expression in the brain through 35 days p.i. I  A  G  I  A  G  I  A  G  I  A  G  I  A  G  I  A  G  I  A (Fig. 7) . In contrast, C57BL/6 mice showed no histopathological changes or viral antigen in any organ, including the lung. These results indicate that Tg2 mice suffer acute pneumonia after infection of the lungs with MERS-CoV, which is related to expression of hDPP4 in the bronchiolar epithelium and pneumocytes. Splenocytes from Tg2 mice (Fig. 4D) ; however, the spleen and other lymphoid tissues did not harbor viral antigens. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced T cell apoptosis upon infection in vitro (28) , whereas immunohistochemical staining detected no evidence of apoptosis in lymphoid tissues, including spleen and lymph nodes, of MERS-CoV-infected Tg2 mice. Similar to findings in the other mouse models in which mouse DPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 (12), MERS-CoV replication and pathology were localized in the lungs in Tg2 mice. Differences in the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection between young and adult hDPP4-Tg mice. According to an epidemiological study (29) , age (\u03fe45 years) is considered to be one of the risk factors for MERS-CoV infection in humans. Therefore, we infected 25-week-old mice with MERS-CoV. Tg2 mice showed significant weight loss from days 7 and 8 p.i. before recovering by day 14 p.i. (Tg2 mice, n \u03ed 6 [one female and five males]; non-Tg mice, n \u03ed 7 [three females and four males]) (Fig. 8A) . However, 25-week-old Tg2 mice showed no obvious clinical signs (such as respiratory illness and mortality). The 25-week-old Tg2 mice had seroconverted by 35 days p.i., whereas the C57BL/6 mice had not (Fig. 8B) . Next, we examined viral replication kinetics and sites of viral replication in 25-week-old Tg2 and non-Tg mice (n \u03ed 4; two females and two males per time point). The nasal wash fluid from one out of four Tg2 mice contained barely detectable levels of infectious virus at 1, 3, and 5 days p.i. (Fig. 8C) . Supernatants from maxilla tissue homogenates (20%) from Tg2 mice contained 10 1.7 and 10 2.0 TCID 50 /g at 1 and 3 days p.i., respectively, although the titer was undetectable at 5 days p.i. The viral titers in lung wash fluid from Tg2 mice were detectable up until 3 days p.i., while the supernatants from lung tissue homogenates (20%) from Tg2 mice showed a high viral load from 1 to 5 days p.i.; infectious virus was detectable up until 7 days p.i. Viral loads in the respiratory tract peaked at 3 days p.i. Although no virus was detectable in the respiratory tract of 10-week-old Tg mice at 7 days p.i., infectious virus was detected in the lungs of 25-week-old Tg mice up until 5 days p.i. In addition, infectious virus was detected in the lungs of one of four 25-week-old Tg mice (10 2.5 TCID 50 /g) even at 7 days p.i. We also found that viral titers in the nasal wash fluid, maxilla (including nostril), lung wash fluid, and lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice on day 3 p.i. (10 2.6 TCID 50 /ml, 10 3.3 TCID 50 /ml, 10 2.3 TCID 50 /ml, and 10 4.9 TCID 50 /ml, respectively) were slightly higher than those in 10-week-old Tg2 mice (10 1.6 TCID 50 /ml, 10 2.9 TCID 50 / ml, 10 1.8 TCID 50 /ml, and 10 4.5 TCID 50 /ml, respectively) (P \u03ed 0.04, Student's t test with Welch's correction).",

Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) is expressed specifically by monocytes/macrophages and is upregulated when these cells are activated. The predominant inflammatory infiltrate within the lungs of both 10week-old and 25-week-old Tg mice comprised Iba-1-positive large cells and CD3positive mononuclear cells (Fig. 10) . Phagocytic vacuoles were prominent in large Iba-1-positive cells from 25-week-old Tg mice. (30) . Therefore, we measured the levels of 20 cytokines and chemokines in lung samples from both 10-week-old and 25-week-old Tg2 mice inoculated with either MERS-CoV or minimal essential medium (MEM). Measurements were made at 6 h and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days p.i. (n \u03ed 3 to 4 [2 females and 1 to 2 males per time point] and n \u03ed 4 [2 females and 2 males per time point]) ( Fig. 11A and B, for 10-week-old and 25-week-old mice, respectively). On day 3 p.i., we observed early expression of gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425)-induced protein 10 (IP-10) in the lungs of both 10-and 25-week-old Tg2 mice, a level which was significantly higher than that in control mice; this increase lasted through day 7. This was followed by a transient increase in expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-13, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in lungs from both 10-and 25-week-old Tg2 mice at day 5 p.i. High levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u2423 (MIP-1\u2423) and monokine induced by IFN-\u2425 (MIG) were detected in the lungs of both groups of Tg2 mice from days 3 or 5 to 7 p.i., whereas IL-12 levels increased at day 7 p.i. IFN-\u2425 production in the lungs of 10-week-old Tg2 mice peaked significantly on day 5 p.i. while high values were seen in both infected and noninfected 25-week-old mice during the observation period. In contrast, expression of IP-10, IL-12, and IL-1\u2424 in 25-week-old Tg mice was higher than that in 10-week-old Tg2 mice. Interestingly, IL-1\u2423 and IL-17 were detected only in 25-week-old Tg2 mice infected with MERS-CoV. IL-1\u2423, a potent proinflammatory cytokine associated with inflammation and fever, was detected from 3 days p.i. and remained significantly elevated until 7 days p.i.; IL-17 (a proinflammatory cytokine that recruits monocytes and neutrophils) was detected from 3 days p.i. and peaked at 5 days p.i. before falling at 7 days p.i. These results indicate that MERS-CoV infection induces production of acute inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in the lungs. In addition, aging causes more severe immunopathology; this means that young and adult Tg mice show different pathologies in the lung after MERS-CoV infection.",

We did not find any evidence of IFN-\u24234 or IFN-\u2424 in the lungs from 10-week-old Tg2 mice at early times postinfection; however, we observed a transient increase in IFN-\u24234 expression in the lungs of two out of four Tg2 mice at 5 days p.i.; this level fell by 7 days p.i. (Fig. 11C) . Day 5 p.i. was the time point at which the amount of virus in the lungs of Tg2 mice began to fall. No IFN-\u2424 mRNA was detectable in lung samples from either group. On the other hand, the lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice showed a transient increase in IFN-\u24234 and IFN-\u2424 mRNA expression at 3 days p.i. (Fig. 11C ). In addition, IFN-\u24234 and IFN-\u2424 mRNA expression was higher than that in 10-week-old Tg2 mice.

This mouse model also shows susceptibility to infection by MERS-CoV; this mimics the nonlethal observations in other mouse models (13, 14) . After intranasal inoculation with a human isolate of MERS-CoV, the Tg mice developed acute and mild interstitial pneumonia; however, the infection was nonlethal and so did not mimic severe cases seen in human MERS-CoV patients. MERS-CoV infection can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, although a large number of MERS-CoV infections follow a mild or asymptomatic course in healthy individuals (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, this Tg mouse model reflects the natural course of a mild MERS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "The majority of severe MERS-CoV cases occur in middle-aged and older males (36, 37) . Therefore, we infected Tg2 mice aged 25 weeks with MERS-CoV. The mice showed prominent proinflammatory responses and prolonged pulmonary inflammation compared with responses in Tg2 mice aged 10 weeks. However, none of the infected Tg2 mice had a severe outcome, such as respiratory distress, that led to death. Epidemiologically, patients with diabetes, kidney failure, or chronic lung disease, all of which might weaken the immune system, tend to have a poor outcome after infection by MERS-CoV (http://www.who.int/csr/don/23-september-2015-mers-kuwait/en/). Thus, it is presumed that a combination of older age and underlying disease might also increase mortality in this animal model. This hDPP4-Tg mouse model, which lacks the clinical signs and mortality associated with severe MERS-CoV infection, is likely to be less advantageous than other lethal mouse models with respect to development of novel vaccines or antiviral agents (12) (13) (14) . When we asked why the Tg2 mice showed nonlethal responses to infection, we could not ignore the fact that virus levels in lungs were lower than those reported for other MERS mouse models (5, 12, 13, 38, 39) . One reason for this is that the transgene used in this study is a hemizygote, meaning that the copy number or expression level may be lower than that in mice homozygous for hDPP4. In addition, the DPP4 protein is active as a dimer (40) , but the Tg2 mice harbor both murine and hDPP4. We presume that the viral yield in the lungs of Tg2 mice was low because of heterodimers formed by hDPP4 and murine DPP4. To address this, we constructed structural models of homo-and heterodimers comprising human and mouse DPP4. Notably, the estimated interaction energy of the DPP4 heterodimers was greater than that of murine and hDPP4 homodimers (\u03ea358.2, \u03ea347.6, and \u03ea344.6 kcal/mol, respectively). These results suggest that DPP4 heterodimers are as stable as DPP4 homodimers. Cockrell et al. reported that mouse DPP4 does not support MERS-CoV entry (38) . Thus, the presence of stable DPP4 heterodimers may be a reason for the lower levels of infection in our mouse model. Further study is necessary to clarify this.",

Tg2 mice developed interstitial pneumonia, and MERS-CoV antigens were detected in the lungs. Virus yields in the lung were up to 100-fold higher than those in the upper respiratory tract.

Although Tg2 mice showed systemic viremia, infection of organs (except lung) did not lead to secondary complications.

Tg2 mice aged 10 and 25 weeks showed increased expression of cytokines and chemokines associated with migration of T cells and activation of macrophages, including IP-10, IL-6, IL-13, MCP-1, IFN-\u2425, MIP-1\u2423, MIG, and IL-12, in the lungs at day 5 and/or 7 p.i. This result is the same as that observed in a hDPP4 knock-in mouse model reported by Coleman et al. (12) . In this hDPP4 knock-in mouse model, CD8 \u03e9 T cells and macrophages affected the course of MERS-CoV-induced disease (12) . In addition, Tg2 mice expressed mRNA encoding the type I IFN, IFN-\u24234, during the early phase of the MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, the pathogenic and immune response data from the knock-in mouse model and our own model are similar. Thus, an acute inflammatory reaction (including production of type I and type II IFNs) and infiltration by macrophages might clear the virus from the lung, thereby preventing progression to MERS. Interestingly, we detected IL-1\u2423 and IL-17 in the lungs of 25-week-old Tg2 mice, but not those of 10-week-old Tg2 mice, after MERS-CoV infection. Both IL-1\u2423 and IL-17 are proinflammatory cytokines that attract monocytes and neutrophils; therefore, they may exacerbate immunopathology after infection. These findings support the notion that the severity of MERS-CoV infection is age dependent. Age is one of the most common factors related to severity and mortality of MERS infection; however, the underlying pathology is unclear (47) .",

In addition, a prominent proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 response, including production of IFN-\u2425, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), IL-15, and IL-17, is seen in patients during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection (52) . In contrast, we found that administration of poly(I\u00b7C) to Tg2 mice induced a mild increase (or earlier induction) in innate immune responses compared with those in C57BL/6 mice and non-Tg mice. This suggests that overexpression of hDPP4 might influence immune responses in Tg2 mice. Thus, we must exercise caution when assessing the relationship between immunopathology and outcome in patients and animal models of MERS-CoV; however, proinflammatory responses seem to contribute to immunopathology during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection in both patients and mouse models.",

MERS-CoV, HCoV-EMC 2012 strain, was kindly provided by Bart Haagmans and Ron Fochier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and was used throughout the study. Vero E6 cells, purchased from the American Type Cell Collection (Manassas, VA), were cultured in Eagle's MEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin G, and 50 g/ml streptomycin (5% FBS-MEM). Stocks of MERS-CoV were propagated and titrated on Vero E6 cells and cryopreserved at \u03ea80\u00b0C. Viral infectivity titers are expressed as the TCID 50 /milliliter on Vero E6 cells and were calculated according to the Behrens-K\u00e4rber method. Work with infectious MERS-CoV was performed under biosafety level 3 conditions. Virus isolation and titration. Lung wash fluids and liver, kidney, heart, spleen, intestine, and brain tissue samples from Tg2, non-Tg, and C57BL/6 mice were collected at the time of postmortem examination and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C. Tissue homogenates (20%, wt/vol) were prepared in 2% FBS-MEM, and samples were inoculated onto Vero E6 cell cultures, which were then examined for cytopathic effects (CPE) for 5 days. Blind passage was performed after freezing and thawing cells from the first-or second-round passages. If MERS-CoV-specific CPE were not observed in the first-, second-, or third-round cultures, the samples were deemed negative for infectious virus. Viral infectivity titers were determined in Vero E6 cell cultures using the microtitration assay described above.",

Expression of the transgene was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis as described below. The Tg mice were then backcrossed onto C57BL/6NCr for five generations. After weaning, the mice were tested for Tg integration by PCR and FACS analysis. Briefly, genomic DNA isolated from ear punch tissues was subjected to PCR using hDPP4-specific primers ( Table  2) , and lymphocytes were isolated from blood taken from the tail vein. Lymphocytes were screened for hDPP4 protein expression by flow cytometry analysis. Tg mice and their non-Tg littermates were used for the MERS-CoV infection study.",
