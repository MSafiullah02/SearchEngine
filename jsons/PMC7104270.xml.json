Usually susceptible individuals can be infected with infectious diseases by directly contacting with infected individuals, body fluids and excreta of infected individuals, or materials polluted by infected individuals; infectious diseases can spread through air, water, food, skin contact, soil, blood, and etc [1]. In nature, there exist a large number of infectious viruses, humans, animals and plants are subjected to their threat all the time. Behind almost every infectious disease, a sad story is always implied. Ebola, outbreak in early 2014, and still raging in Africa, has made thousands of Africans died [2], [3], [4]; in early 2002, outbreak of SARS had made tens of thousands of Chinese people died, more Chinese people disabled [5], [6], [7], [8]; H7N9 [9], [10], [11], [12] or H5N6 [13], [14], which visits southern regions of China every year, makes a lot of poultry slaughtered.",

Individuals in the SEIQR epidemic model are automatically and dynamically divided into 5 classes, namely class S, E, I, Q and R, individuals in each class can be considered into a subclass of population, and then diversity is realized naturally.(4)\nEvolution. Each individual in the ecosystem has instincts to survive, which makes itself to grow better or become stronger.(5)\nIntegration. There are 13 operators in the proposed algorithm, thus it provides a good opportunity to integrate some cores of some optimization algorithms together.(6)\nHeart rhythm. 13 legal state transitions can lead the corresponding 13 operators to execute equi-probably; the curve of a state transition is very similar to that of a person\u2019s heart rhythm. If a special operator is found to have high performance when SEIQRA solves a problem, then the operator will be executed with higher probability, a targeted exploration is realized, it is just the heart palpitation.(7)\nPVI. When SARS attacks people, only a very small part of organs are infected, through test we find that only 1/1000\u20131/10 of all variables take part in computation, the proposed algorithm can obtain high performance, thus a native reduction of dimensionality is realized.\n",

In this case we use the I\u2013R operator to calculate the growth state Xit of individual i.(d)If at time t\u22121 individual i stayed at state Q, then we can know that now individual i is cured and obtains a certain period of immunity simultaneously after it is isolated, namely Q\u2192R. In this case we use the Q\u2013R operator to calculate the growth state Xit of individual i.(e)If at time t\u22121 individual i stayed at state R, then we can know that now individual i does not lose its immunity and still stays at state R, namely R\u2192R. In this case we use the R\u2013R operator to calculate the growth state Xit of individual i.\n(4)If at time t the state transition of individual i is illegal, then individual i keeps its original state unchanged.(5)Repeat Step (2) to (4) until each individual is processed, then go to Step (6).(6)Let t=t+1.Repeat Step (1) to (5) until the global optimum solution is found.\n",

            "text": "Based on the Fig. 2(b), we can find the general method to explain each state transition and update SEIQR\ni(t) and Xit of individual i, and define the biological meaning of transition types. By decomposing Fig. 2(b), we obtain the following two cases:(1)At time t, an individual can transfer from state A to state B, as shown in\nFig. 3(a), where A and B\n\u2208{S, E, I, Q, R}, but A\u2260B. A large number of state transitions belong to the case, for example, S\u2192E, S\u2192R, E\u2192I, E\u2192R, I\u2192Q, I\u2192R, Q\u2192R and R\u2192S.When an individual transfers from state A to state B, or an individual at class A becomes an individual at class B, we will let the composite state values of some features of several individuals who stay at state B endow to the corresponding features of the individual who stays at state A, namely we enable some features of the individual to possess of similar state values of the corresponding features of some individuals who have stayed at state B. This method realizes that an individual transfers from class A to class B really. For example, for state transition S\u2192E, we let the average state values of some features of several exposed or infected individuals who have stayed at state E or state I endow to the corresponding features of a susceptible individual who stays at state S, then we can make the individual to get exposed, namely state transition S\u2192E is achieved. This strategy means that some exposed or infected individuals transfer their own something with virus to a susceptible individual, making it to get exposed.(2)At time t, when an individual stays at state A, A\n\u2208{S, E, I, Q, R}, any state transition does not take place, it is equivalent to A\u2192A, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Each node in Fig. 2(b) actually implies the case shown in Fig. 3(b), for example, S\u2192S, E\u2192E, I\u2192I, Q\u2192Q and R\u2192R.\n",

Because SEIQRA has 13 operators, it has wider adaptability to solve different types of optimization problems.4.A small part of variables being involved in each iteration: Since a virus attacks only a small part of individual features every time, when individuals in different states exchange their feature information, there is just a small portion of features used in computation, even so, the individual\u2019s IPI can still be well improved. Owing to the substantial reduction of features in calculation, when solving complicated optimization problems, especially high-dimensional optimization problems, SEIQRA can converge significantly and rapidly.5.The stable setting of parameters: Although SEIQRA uses more parameters to control its running, the setting of its parameters is stable.6.Multiple operations: Because SEIQRA possesses of 13 operators, it provides opportunities to contain many operations simultaneously.7.Convergence: When evolving, the individuals with strong physique can continue to grow, while the individuals with weak physique will stop growing. This kind of search strategy can ensure global optima to be found at higher probability.8.Visualization: The story-based design of SEIQRA makes it easy to visualize its process of evolution when solving an optimization problem.SEIQRA has characteristics of high adaptability, fast solving speed and convergence for complicated function optimization problems. Besides these, precision of global optimal solutions can also be improved by operator REINIT. These characteristics of SEIQRA may facilitate practical applications. Further study in the future includes:(1)How to use the mechanisms of immunity to construct immunity-based operators;(2)How to use the mechanisms of virus attacking cells to construct virus transmission operators;(3)How to use the mechanisms of infectious disease treatment to construct infectious disease treatment operators;(4)How to implant independent virus description factor into features of an individual;(5)How to embed various kinds of viruses in SEIQRA;(6)How to bring more different types of individuals into SEIQRA;(7)How to reflect time-delay differences of outbreak of different viruses in SEIQRA.\n\n",
