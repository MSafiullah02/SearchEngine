The locked-down may result in famine throughout the region of underdeveloped countries after the outbreak. So, a conjectural setup of an epidemic has been studied by applying specific period of locked-down (30 days) in 5 different scenarios. The stochastic approach to the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model has been used to evaluate the dynamics and the effects of locked-down. It is observed that there exist a suitable period to apply locked-down where more susceptible escape from the infection. The effect of the early (as soon as the infected case detected) and late (with respect to the estimated peak of detected cases for no locked-down) implementation of the locked-down has also been studied and found that the late implementation of locked-down will take the least time to end the epidemic. The CFR (Case Fatality Rate) has also been found to be varied from 7.55 to 8.02 for all the considered scenarios.",

To prevent the damages due to the virulent pandemic, all the regional area require to be locked-down. But most of the countries of the world cannot provide food to their people if they get locked-down for months. They have to trade the damages due to the epidemic of their people with foods and economics for the people. Besides, a virus outbreak like coronavirus can take years to control and vaccinated. Thus, it is very necessary to know about the implementation strategy of the locked-down situation to a country of low and middle income.",

It is to be noted that the increase in the detected case is found after the 44 th day. The effect of locked-down for the described scenarios is visualized in Fig. 3 by considering the detected active cases (D E ). In the case of scenario 1 and 2, the shift in the increase of detected active cases has been observed whereas a steady and decreasing trend has been observed for scenario 3 and 4, respectively. For scenario 5, there is no observable shift whereas the widest shifting is found for scenario 1. It is also observed that the peak of the detected cases for scenario 3 is lower than 0.25% whereas all other scenarios it crosses the 0.80% of the total population (percentages are taken with respect to the total population).

In the case of scenario 3, the peak is found after 79 th day which is 9-days later of the locked-down implementation day (1/\u03b2 + 1/\u03c3 + 1/\u03b3 \u2248 9). Such a 9-days activity is also found for scenario 4 decrease rapidly after 109 th day with respect to the no locked-down situation. Since the detected cases are not inter-related (a random fraction of the infected cases are detected), the downward shift of the peak between Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 is understandable. All the locked down scenarios have happened as expected for the estimation of infected cases. The dynamics of the susceptible population (S) is the greater interest of this conjectural experiment. Fig. 5 shows the variation in the dynamics of the susceptible population for all the cases. It is found that there are more than 30% susceptible population remains unaffected after the epidemic for no locked-down, early and lately locked-down (scenario 1, 2 and 3). It is also observed that this percentage become more than 40% for scenario 3 and 4 (where locked-down happened near the peak of without locked down). The early or late locked down seems to produce a similar number of unaffected susceptible. These analyses indicate that there exists a suitable time for applying conditional locked down where more people can escape from the infection. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) calculation is complicated as it should not be [13, 14, 15] . In this article, the CFR has been calculated as the rate of deceased for the recovered population at the same time [16] . It is observed that the CFR varies from 7.55 to 8.02 for all the locked-down scenario including no locked-down case after 130 days (Fig. 6) . The lowest CFR is found for the scenario 2 whereas it is expected for the scenario 3 because of the steady observation in detected cases (with respect to Fig.  3) . The initial fluctuations are well understood for their detection and treatment to the patient. The observed under or over estimation in the initial CFR has been well discussed by Rajgor et.al. [14] . Though the number of case fatality depends on many of the other factors (like age, immunity, previous medical condition etc.), the variation in the observed CFR indicates that the fatality can also be depended on the applying conditional locked-down.",
