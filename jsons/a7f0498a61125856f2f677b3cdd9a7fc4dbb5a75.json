While healthcare-associated strains are mainly a risk to vulnerable people, for CA-MRSA, any family member is at risk and it is more prevalent among children and young adults where they cause infections of cuts, wounds and abrasions. US experience suggests the risk is greatest among those engaging skin-to-skin contact activities and contact with contaminated objects such as towels, sheets and sports equipment. Transmission is common in settings such as prisons, schools and sports teams. 42 A study assessing the transmission of CA-MRSA in a university in the US, found multidrug resistant USA300 responsible for diseases including necrotizing pneumonia, severe sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis, on common touch surfaces at the university, student homes and local community settings. This suggests transfer between different locations within the community. 61 Enterobacterales are a common cause of community-associated infections, including urinary tract infections and bacteremia as well as gastrointestinal infections. 51 67 Kitchen sponges not only act as reservoirs of microorganisms, but also as disseminators over domestic surfaces, which can lead to cross-contamination of hands and food, which is considered a main cause of foodborne disease outbreaks.",

This is achieved using hygiene procedures (products plus process) to reduce pathogenic microorganisms on critical surfaces to a level where they are no longer harmful to health -thereby preventing ongoing spread. 15, 84 Several methods exist to achieve such reduction in potential pathogens: mechanical/physical removal using dry wiping, soap or detergent-based cleaning together with adequate rinsing, inactivation or eradication using a disinfectant on hard surfaces or an alcohol-based sanitizer on the hands, or a physical process such as heating (to \u226560\u00b0C/140\u00b0F) or ultraviolet treatment. Most frequently, a combination of these approaches is likely to be used. 15, 84 When developing hygiene procedures aimed at breaking the chain of infection, the goal should be to ensure that each procedure is appropriate to its intended use. In recent years, risk modelling has been developed in order to achieve this. 80 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) was originally developed for ensuring water quality and is increasingly being used to develop infection prevention control strategies in other settings, including healthcare. 85, 86 QMRA is a scientifically-validated approach that uses published data to model the chain of infection and estimate safe residual level of contamination at critical points in the chain. 84 , 87 This information is then used to estimate the log reduction required to reduce contamination to a safe level. Based on these estimates, tests modelling use conditions can be used to develop effective hygiene procedures to achieve the required reduction. The approach is set out in more detail by Bloomfield et al. 84 In the past, recommendations on selection of hygiene procedures for home and everyday life were based on the health status of family members, and it is still argued by some that disinfectants should only be used in situations where people are infected or at increased risk of infection. 87 Although there is data to show that hygiene is important in preventing transmission of MRSA colonization and infection in the domestic environment, further investigation is required to demonstrate the full extent to which poor home hygiene may contribute to the burden of foodborne infection associated with antibiotic resistant strains.",

However, these reports conclude that there is little evidence for this effect occurring in real-life clinical practice, and have called for further research into whether microbicide use influences antibiotic resistance in the community. 108-111 Rutala et al. (2000) found that the frequency of occurrence of antibiotic resistance in environmental isolates from homes was much lower than for clinical isolates from a hospital intensive care unit and an outpatient setting where there was routine extensive use of antibiotics. 112 Two studies were carried out to investigate whether antibiotic resistant strains were more likely to be found in homes where antibacterial products were used, compared with homes where they were not. 113, 114 Samples were collected from houses in the USA and UK of 30 users and nonusers of antibacterials. Susceptibility tests against antibiotics and antibacterial agents (triclosan, pine oil, BAC and para-chloro-meta-xylenol) were carried out on the bacteria isolated. The authors concluded that there was no evidence that antibiotic resistant strains occurred more frequently in user homes compared with non-user homes. A 1-year study by Aiello et al (2005) also showed that household use of antibacterial cleaning products was not a significant risk factor for occurrence of antibiotic resistant isolates from hands. 115 Despite more than 20 years of research, there is still no conclusive resolution to the question of whether and to what extent; microbicides might contribute to AMR in clinical practice. In light of laboratory data, which indicates that microbicide-induced AMR is biologically plausible for some types of microbicides, it is concluded that use of microbicides needs to be prudent and appropriate and that the products containing them must be used at recommended concentrations and with the appropriate contact time.",

Although the precise impact of hygiene on transmission of infection between community and healthcare settings needs further investigation, it is important to recognise, that reducing the need for antibiotic prescribing and the circulation of AMR strains in healthcare settings cannot be achieved without also reducing circulation of infections and AMR strains in the community. We cannot allow hygiene in home and everyday life settings to become the weak link in the chain.",

As seen with the recent global pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing and delaying the threat from infectious microorganisms and when employed at other times, are likely to reduce disease for which antibiotics would be prescribed or even mis-prescribed. At the time of writing this review and according to Dr Maarten van Dongen, founder of AMR Insights, the global deaths from SARS-CoV-2 between November 2019 and March 2020 reached 16,500 with many affected succumbing to secondary bacterial infections. In comparison, 2000 people worldwide die as a result of resistant bacteria every day, 8 amounting to 258,000 people dying from the effects of AMR within a similar time-frame. The latest analysis by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (GLASS) program, which included data from 49 countries, found high levels of AMR in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in every WHO region. 2",

By contrast, if all individuals washed their hands with soap following contact with the ground/minced beef, producing a 0.3 log reduction on hands, this would result in an estimated 0.014 infections per year (98% median risk reduction compared with no handwashing). If all individuals used an alcohol-based hand sanitizer following contact with the beef, producing a 4.3 log reduction on the hands, this would result in an estimated 0.00005 infections/year -a 99.9996% median risk reduction for the hand sanitizer compared with handwashing. Duff et al. 104 developed a computer-based model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a disinfection program that targeted high-risk food preparation activities in household kitchens. The model estimated that approximately 80,000 Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli O157 infections could be prevented annually in US homes, resulting in $138 million in direct medical cost savings and a gain of 15,845 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

The major differences are that there are more risk factors for infection, including drug-resistant infections in the community in LMICs asa result of sub-optimal environmental sanitation, lack of environmental regulations, highdensity housing, and inadequate access to clean water due to contamination during collection, transportation, storage, and use.116 These issues can lead to situations such as those found in India, where unregulated over-the-counter sales of antibiotics, poor sanitation and environmental antibiotic pollution, alongside other behavioral, cultural and social factors, have created ideal conditions for a rapid rise in MDR infections.117,118",

This paper is the output of a scientific meeting commissioned by The Global Hygiene Council involving an invited group of experts from the fields of microbiology, AMR, hygiene and public health. The paper is not a systematic review, which has already been undertaken by others, including the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene (IFH) (http://www.ifhhomehygiene.org), but presents key evidence that the home and other everyday life settings are important for the transmission of infections and the acquisition and spread of AMR, and that home and everyday life hygiene should be given greater consideration in global and national action plans. It is also important to acknowledge that while hygiene measures are a vital part of infection prevention, addressing the rising threat of AMR requires a holistic approach which includes reducing the use of antibiotics in agriculture, introducing tighter regulations of over the counter sales and improving access to clean water and protection against colonization and infection, at the times and places where there is the greatest risk of transmission. This in turn reduces the need for antibiotics, thereby minimizing the selection pressure for development of AMR.",

The ease of transfer of MRSA from hospitals to the home via healthcare workers and others in contact with hospitals has been demonstrated in multiple studies.[52][53][54][55][56] This is illustrated by a study 57 where significant levels of community and hospital strains of MRSA were recovered from high-frequency touch surfaces (door handles, toilet seats, reception areas, public washrooms, corridors and lifts) in public areas in the community and in London hospitals, suggesting cross-contamination between the two settings. Once in the home, MRSA can colonize and/or cause infection among family members.[58][59][60] Other studies show the spread of MRSA from a colonized index case (e.g. a nurse) at work to the home environment and other family members.56 Antibiotic treatment of family members failed to eradicate colonization because they became recolonized from contaminated environmental surfaces. Eradication was only successful when antibiotic treatment was combined with rigorous cleaning of the home environment.56 Further studies on spread of MRSA in the home environment are reviewed by 2012. 42",
