            "text": "As cats continue to become more popular as household companions and pets [1], a variety of viral infections pose a serious threat to felines, including a high incidence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) [2], feline coronavirus (FCoV) [3], feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) [4], and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) [5]. Currently, the only preventative vaccines and therapeutic drugs available for use in pet cats have limited effectiveness. Nevertheless, interferons (IFNs) play an increasingly complementary role in antiviral therapy for virus-infected cats [6]. The main function of IFNs in the antiviral immune response is to induce the expression of antiviral proteins that then further activate antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory cellular responses [7]. Generally, IFNs are classified into three subgroups: type I IFNs, type II IFNs, and type III IFNs. Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03b4, IFN-\u03c4, and IFN-\u03b6, play a direct role in antiviral immune responses [7,8]. Type II IFN, namely IFN-\u03b3, is produced by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in response to the recognition of infected cells [9]. Type III IFNs, including IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3, regulate the antiviral immune response via a distinct receptor complex similar to type I IFNs [10,11].",

FeLV is an important pathogen in both domestic and wild cats that causes degenerative and immunosuppressive disorders, such as anorexia, apathy, cachexia, and progressive weakness [13,14]. Published research has demonstrated that feIFN-\u03c9 has the therapeutic potential to treat FeLV-infected cats [13,15], presumably by inhibiting the replication cycle of FeLV [16]. Several studies have revealed that recombinant feline IFN-\u03c9 (rfeIFN-\u03c9) had statistically significant therapeutic effects on both FeLV infection and FeLV/FIV coinfection [13,17]. Currently, rfeIFN-\u03c9, serving as an immunomodulator, is the first interferon licensed for use in cats to treat FeLV, FIV, and canine parvovirus infections [6,8,18]. Feline infectious peritonitis, which is triggered by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (a virulent mutant of feline enteric coronavirus), is a lethal infectious disease in cats with still no effective drugs available for treatment [19,20,21]. Previous studies have demonstrated that rfeIFN-\u03c9 represents a therapeutic candidate for treating FIPV-infected cats [6]. In addition, data from several studies suggest that rfeIFN-\u03c9 can also exert protective effects on other viral infections, including bovine enterovirus (BEV), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), feline parvovirus, feline calicivirus, and feline coronavirus [6,18,22,23,24,25].",

Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of the purified feIFN-\u03c9 sample was serially diluted ten-fold in DMEM containing 10% FBS and transferred to confluent F81 cell monolayers in 96-well cell culture plates, and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 18 h.

The cells were then destained with 0.1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min before determining the absorbance of each well at 595 nm. Each sample was performed with eight biological replicates and three technical replicates. The antiviral activity of the IFN was calculated as the method previously described, which is expressed as units per milligram according to the ratio of IFN titer and protein concentration [27]. In parallel, the INTERCAT IFN antiviral drug (Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan) was used as an IFN treatment control.

We know of a wide variety of viral infections that can seriously endanger the health of pet cats, such as FeLV, FIV, FIPV, FCoV, and feline calicivirus (FCV). Interferon represents a promising potential therapeutic agent that can effectively treat pet cats infected with these viruses. In this study, we identified two new genes encoding feline IFN-\u03c9 (feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b) in the spleen lymphocytes of cats. Following sequence homology analysis, we found that feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b shared maximum nucleotide sequence homologies of 91.88% and 90.20%, and maximum amino acid homologies of 91.6% and 89.4% with the 13 previously published subtypes of feline IFN-\u03c9, respectively. In addition, phylogenetic tree analysis of IFNs in cats and other species constructed using neighbor-joining analysis revealed that feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b do belong to the type I IFN family, but their evolutionary relationship to known feline IFN-\u03c9 genes was distant, indicating that feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b were indeed new subtypes of feline IFN-\u03c9. We deposited these two genes into the GenBank with the accession numbers MK682680 (feIFN-\u03c9a) and MK682681 (feIFN-\u03c9b), thus enriching the IFN-\u03c9 data submitted to the GenBank [12].",

The mature proteins, with normal biological activity, were formed only after the signal peptide sequence was removed from the precursor protein, thus allowing them to be secreted outside the cell membrane [28,29]. We used online software to predict that the signal peptide sequence of the feIFN-\u03c9a/\u03c9b proteins consists of 23 amino acid residues, and that the signal peptide cleavage site is located between residues Gly23 and Cys24. The results indicated that the recombinant feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b proteins could be expressed in vitro in their soluble forms. Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification process that can affect the antigenic determinants, charge properties, enzymatic properties, and thermal stability of proteins. Similar to previous reports for the 13 known feIFN-\u03c9 subtypes [12], we observed no N-glycosylation sites present in feIFN-\u03c9a or feIFN-\u03c9b. However, our analyses predicted nine potential O-glycosylation sites in feIFN-\u03c9a and six potential O-glycosylation sites in feIFN-\u03c9b, which is different from previous reports on the other known IFN-\u03c9 subtypes [6]. Studies have shown that glycosylation sites can play an important role in determining the activity of IFNs [30,31]. For example, glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 has been observed to be markedly more potent than non-glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 against hepatitis C virus, BVDV, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus, with even more superior effects than IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 [6,30].",

These expression systems are capable of making post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which allows proteins to fold correctly, thus producing highly active and stable IFNs [32,33,34,35,36]. However, the application of these systems is limited by drawbacks, such as low yield of IFN protein and complicated operation requirements [37]. Therefore, E. coli expression systems are still the most widely used prokaryotic expression system for protein production with their characteristics of simple procedures, large-scale production, and low cost [38,39,40]. Generally, recombinant IFN is produced by E. coli expression systems in an insoluble inclusion body form that has not been modified or folded correctly, resulting in the loss of its biological activity [41,42]. To obtain a soluble and biologically active IFN protein, the inclusion bodies need to be denatured and then renatured, which is a time-consuming, laborious process [40]. In this study, we selected the prokaryotic soluble expression system pCold-TF to prepare recombinant feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b. The pCold-TF system is a highly efficient soluble expression system with a His-tagged TF that allows the expressed protein to be effectively modified, folded, and secreted into the cytoplasm [43,44]. Following the construction of recombinant E. coli strains and induction by IPTG, the rfeIFN-\u03c9a/\u03c9b proteins were expressed in their soluble forms and analyzed via SDS-PAGE. We optimized expression conditions for the rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b proteins and purified them using His-tag Ni2+ affinity column chromatography. Both proteins showed antiviral activity against VSV in microdose cytopathic effect inhibition assays using F81 cells. Our results provide a basis for further studies into the development of rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b as therapeutic agents for viral infections. Meanwhile, our data provide evidence that the pCold-TF expression system can be used to produce IFN with full bioactivity.",

In this study, our results demonstrated that both rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b had antiviral activity in homologous animal cells (F81 cells, cat) and heterologous animal cells (Vero cells, monkey; MDBK cells, cattle; MDCK cells, dog; PK-15 cells, pig), indicating that rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b have broad cross-species antiviral activity in vitro, similar to previously published findings in MDBK and MDCK cells [12]. In contrast, the antiviral activities of rfeIFN-\u03c9b in homologous and heterologous animal cells were better than that of rfeIFN-\u03c9a. Intriguingly, the rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b proteins exhibited antiviral activity in MDCK cells, despite the absence of IFN-\u03c9 in canines [46,47]. We speculate that different IFNs with different physiological functions are likely responsible for the difference of results obtained in our study compared to other published studies. Furthermore, analysis of the broad-spectrum antiviral activities of rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b revealed that they were effective against VSV, FCoV, PEDV, BVDV, and CPV. Out of those five viruses, antiviral activity was strongest against VSV and FCoV. No significant differences in antiviral activity against CPV, BVDV, or PEDV were observed between rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b. However, the overall broad-spectrum antiviral activity of rfeIFN-\u03c9b was significantly stronger than that of rfeIFN-\u03c9a.",

            "text": "Recently, combination antiviral therapy has become a common practice in treating feline viral infections due to pharmacokinetics and the short half-life of IFN alone [48,49]. There are many published studies focused on the combination of IFN-\u03c9 with other therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents [50], IFN-\u03b1 [51], and ribavirin [6], suggesting this is an attractive strategy to use against viral infections. We further evaluated the antiviral effects of rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b combined with feline IL-18 against VSV and FCoV in F81 cells. Our results revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of combination therapy was significantly increased compared to that of rfeIFN-\u03c9a or rfeIFN-\u03c9b alone, indicating that rfeIFN-\u03c9 combination therapy may represent a more potent option than monotherapy for treating viral infections in cats; however, this hypothesis requires further exploration in vivo. In summary, the rfeIFN-\u03c9a and rfeIFN-\u03c9b obtained in this study exhibit significant broad-spectrum antiviral activity in both homologous and heterologous cells in vitro, particularly rfeIFN-\u03c9b, suggesting a promising candidate for the development of an effective therapeutic agent against viral infections in cats and other animals.",

We analyzed the characteristics of feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b in detail using bioinformatics followed by soluble expression and optimization of induction conditions in E. coli. Our data showed that purified recombinant feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b had broad-spectrum antiviral activity in homologous and heterologous animal cells, suggesting they are candidates for the development of effective therapeutic agents to be used against viral infections in pet cats. And, our research is underway to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the two novel feIFNs as therapeutics agent for cat viral infections in vivo. In addition, the reported feIFN-\u03c9 sequences will enrich the IFN data submitted to GenBank.",
