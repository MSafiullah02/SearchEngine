Long-term success of an antiviral 17 therapeutic is determined not only by its efficacy but also by the duration of time required for drug-18 resistance to evolve. We have developed a microfluidic device comprised of ~6000 wells, with each 19 well containing a microstructure to capture single cells.

            "text": "As a part of a study evaluating PV infection dynamics on the single-cell level, we 43 observed that a chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotide selectively eliminates the most-fit 44 members of the viral population (Guo et al., 2017) . This class of antiviral agent has always been 45 touted as having a high barrier to resistance (Jordheim et al., 2013) . The typical explanation for 46 this high barrier is that amino acid substitutions in the active site of the viral RNA polymerase 47 conferring resistance to the antiviral ribonucleoside also impair the specificity and/or efficiency 48 of incorporation of natural ribonucleotides (Carroll et al., 2003) . Elimination of the most-fit 49 members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerge from the 50 surviving, low-fitness member of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of 51 fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (Andino and 52 For all experiments reported herein, we infect HeLa S3 cells off chip with PV engineered 106 to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (PV-eGFP) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 107 plaque-forming units per cell (PFU/cell), pellet and wash cells to remove free virus, suspend cells 108 to a density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL, and load the microfluidic device. Each well is monitored for 109 eGFP fluorescence every 30 min for a 24 h period, which gives rise to a population of time 110 courses exhibiting substantial between-cell variability (Fig. S4a) . We plot the percentage of 111 infected cells as a function of drug concentration and fit to a hyperbola to obtain a value for the 112 IC50 value. In the case of 2'-C-Me-A, concentrations greater than 50 \u00b5M exhibit toxicity 113 (Stuyver et al., 2006) ; therefore, these data do not fit to a hyperbola (Fig. S4b) . It is clear from 114 this experiment, however, that the approach is sensitive enough to acquire data for a complete 115 dose-response analysis (Fig S4b) . 116 8 A major advantage of the single-cell platform is that the effect of a drug on the viable 117 population can be determined. To analyze the single-cell data, we use five phenomenological 118 parameters extracted from each time course (Fig. S4c) . These parameters are: maximum 119 fluorescence observed, which correlates to yield of genomic RNA; slope at the time of half-120 maximum fluorescence, which correlates to replication speed; infection time, which, to a first 121 approximation, is the time it takes for an infection to go from start to finish akin to the virus 122 generation time; start-point, which is the earliest time in which fluorescence can be detected; and 123 midpoint, the time of half-maximum fluorescence. This analysis leads to a distribution of values 124",

The mean of the 188 distribution of values for the maximum parameter did not change in the presence of GA (Fig. 3b) , 189 in contrast to the inhibitors targeting viral proteins. Observation of a statistically significant 190 difference in the distribution of the values for the infection-time parameter was concentration 191 dependent (Fig. 3d) . A statistically significant difference for mean of the distributions for the 192 remaining parameters was observed at concentrations corresponding to the IC50 and above (Figs.  193   3c, 3e and 3f) . A third signature of antiviral action is therefore revealed with GA. 194 Given the interest in using HSP90 inhibitors as therapeutics for cancer, a variety of 195 compounds exist (Hwang et al., 2009; Sidera and Patsavoudi, 2014) . For example, ganetespib 196 (GS) is an HSP90 inhibitor that differs from GA substantially in chemical structure (compare 197 inset in Fig. S6 to that in Fig. 3a) , has a higher affinity for HSP90 than GA Evaluation of antiviral drug combinations. The long-term utility of an antiviral therapy is 215 determined, in part, by the time required for resistance mutants to emerge. One approach to 216 delaying or even eliminating the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is the use of antiviral 217 combinations (Dunning et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2009) . What is often evaluated is the ability 218 of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than 219 observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2'-C-Me-A to synergize 220 with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC50 values (Fig. 4a) . In 221 the absence of drug, 34 \u00b1 3% of cells in the device were infected. That number was reduced to 18 222 \u00b1 2%, 30 \u00b1 3%, or 15 \u00b1 3% in the presence of 2'-C-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, 223",

Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism 298 using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform 299 mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and 300 development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogues to be synthesized during the drug-301 development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action, 302 single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis 303 instead of much, much later in the development process.

Single-cell analysis of antiviral candidates reveals 23 not only efficacy but also properties of the members of the viral population most sensitive to the drug, 24 the stage of the lifecycle most affected by the drug, and perhaps even if the drug targets an interaction 25 of the virus with its host. 26 27 KEYWORDS: antiviral, mechanism of action, microfluidics, single-cell analysis, past few decades, the world has witnessed outbreaks of myriad RNA viruses, 31 including West Nile Virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, chikungunya 32 virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and most recently the poliovirus (PV)-related viruses: enterovirus 33 D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) (Antona et al., 2016; Baize et al., 2014; Burt et al., 34 2012; Campbell et al., 2002; Campos et al., 2015; Peiris et al., 2003). Unfortunately, viral 35 emergence has outpaced the discovery and development of compounds capable of treating these 36 pathogens. Because sporadic outbreaks come, go, and may never come again, development of 37 broad-spectrum therapeutics exhibiting high barriers to resistance would have the greatest value. 38 Unbiased screening of chemical libraries for antiviral agents using cell-based assays have no 39 problem identifying active compounds of high potency.

Viral polymerases represent a well-established 94 target of antiviral therapeutics. For example, cocktails used to treat human immunodeficiency 95 virus infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection include synthetic nucleoside analogues 96 targeting reverse transcriptase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively 97 (Cihlar and Ray, 2010; Sofia et al., 2012). The non-obligate, chain-terminating antiviral 98 ribonucleoside, 2'-C-Me-A, is the prototype for the HCV RdRp inhibitor, sofosbuvir and related 99 compounds (Eltahla et al., 2015). In a previous study, we evaluated infections that survived 100 treatment when present at a concentration that reduces the number of infections by 50% (IC50). 101 To our surprise, we observed selective ablation of cells infected with virus variants capable of the 102 fastest rates of replication and the highest yields of replicated RNA (Guo et al., 2017). This 103 experiment suffered from the inability to evaluate concentrations of drug higher than the value of 104 the IC50. Here, we use 2'-C-Me-A to validate the new device. 105",

S4f -S4h). Tabulation of the data and 133 statistical analysis for this experiment is provided in Tables S1 and S2. These observations 134 reproduce outcomes presented by us previously using the first-generation device (Guo et al., 135 2017). Members of the viral population with highest values for maximum and slope parameters 136 are most sensitive to 2'-C-Me-A. 137 138 Evaluation of a PV 3C-protease inhibitor. The observation that a subset of the viral population 139 was most sensitive to 2'-C-Me-A was unexpected but could be easily rationalized by the notion of well-established antiviral therapeutics used in the cocktails to treat HIV and 144 HCV, respectively (de Leuw and Stephan, 2018; Pokorna et al., 2009; Wlodawer and Vondrasek, 145 1998). Inhibitors of the picornaviral protease responsible for polyprotein processing (3C) have 146 been pursued for many years (Wang and Liang, 2010). For this study, we selected rupintrivir, 147 which targets the 3C protease activity of all three types of polioviruses as well as that of other 148 enteroviruses (Binford et al., 2005; De Palma et al., 2008). 149We measured the impact of rupintrivir on establishment of PV infection in HeLa S3 cells 150(Fig. 2a). The IC50 value was 8.0 \u00b1 4.0 nM, which agrees with values (20 nM) measured using 151 conventional plaque assays(De Palma et al., 2008). We analyzed the single-cell data obtained at 152 all concentrations (Tables S3 and S4) but focused only on the concentrations approximating the 153 IC50 and 2 \u00d7 IC50, 10 nM and 20 nM, respectively, to emphasize trends in the data. At both 154 concentrations, we observed a statistically significant difference compared to the control for all 155 parameters: maximum(Fig. 2b); slope(Fig. 2c); infection time(Fig. 2d); start point (Fig. 2e); 156",

Compounds antagonizing the function of cellular chaperones 169 represent an emergent class of anti-cancer and antiviral therapeutics (Chatterjee and Burns, 2017; 170 Geller et al., 2012). Chaperones of the heat-shock-protein-90 (HSP90) family are required when 171 the cell is growing fast and/or producing high levels of proteins, as observed in cancer cells or in 172 virus-infected cells. Seminal studies from the Frydman and Andino laboratories demonstrate a 173 clear, essential role for HSP90 in production of infectious PV virions. However, every step of the 174 virus lifecycle has been suggested as a target for HSP90 when viruses outside of the picornavirus 175 family are considered (Geller et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017). The benefit of targeting antiviral 176therapeutics to cellular proteins is that the likelihood for evolution of resistance is minimized 177(Geller et al., 2007). 178We have used geldanamycin (GA), because it is a potent inhibitor of HSP90 (nM range) 179 that is active against PV(Geller et al., 2007).

The parameters presented in the panels are as follows: (b) maximum; (c) slope; (d) 239 infection time; (e) start point; (f) midpoint. 240Evaluation of single-cell data by using principal component analysis (PCA). Our evaluation 241 of three classes of anti-PV drugs revealed three unique signatures based on changes to the 242 phenomenological parameters used to describe infection dynamics. We reasoned that PCA might 243 provide an even more robust approach to compare datasets using our five parameters. As shown 244 inFig. 5, PCA resolves each class of inhibitor from the other, as well as from outcomes in the 245 absence of drug. Importantly, the mechanistically related but chemically distinct inhibitors of 246HSP90 cluster by PCA (see GA and GS in Fig. 5). We conclude that single-cell analysis of 247 antiviral therapeutics can provide not only information on the efficacy of a drug but also 248 information on the mechanism of action. This experimental paradigm should have a 249 transformative impact on the drug-development process. Mechanistic classes of antiviral agents distinguished by principal component 252 analysis (PCA) of single-cell data. Points representing groups of single cells are colored 253 according to compound identities with each point representing a different drug-treatment 254 concentration. PCA was performed using the mean values of the maximum, slope, infection time, 255 start point and midpoint from the various drug-treatment concentrations and control groups. The 256 top two principal components accounted for 94% of the total variance. The light blue lines 257 indicate the relationship between variables in the space of the first two components. of single-cell virology has begun (Combe et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017; Russell et 260 al., 2018). Infection outcomes in cells are determined, in part, by stochastic processes (Heldt et al., 261 2015). For example, the presence and abundance of viral-restriction factors and viral-replication-262 promoting factors of the host are largely governed by stochastic gene expression (Raj and van 263 Oudenaarden, 2008). As a result, substantial between-cell variation exists in all quantifiable 264 parameters of infection. An underappreciated consequence of the behavior of systems such as 265 these is the non-self-averaging nature of these systems, which means that the population average 266 of any single-cell parameter will almost certainly fail to represent the dynamics within any single 267 cell (Derrida, 1997; Wiseman and Domany, 1998). The practical complication arising from this 268 phenomenon is that changes in the average kinetics observed in a growth curve for a virus caused 269 by a perturbation, for example exposure to an antiviral therapeutic, will not inform accurately the 270 step(s) of the viral lifecycle impacted most by the perturbation. 271 With this perspective in mind, it is not surprising that our previous evaluation of an 272 antiviral ribonucleotide using a single-cell approach revealed the unexpected finding that the 273 most-fit members of the viral population were most susceptible to this class of compounds (Guo 274 et al., 2017). This observation left one major unresolved question: do all effective antiviral 275 therapeutics target the same subpopulation of viruses or do unique signatures exist for distinct 276 mechanistic classes of antiviral therapeutics? Addressing these questions is the central objective 277 of this study. 278 Our first-generation microfluidic device for on-chip investigation of viral infection 279 dynamics relied on cell density as the mechanism to achieve isolation of single cells in wells of 280 the device, an approach which leaves most wells of the device empty (Guo et al., 2017). We have 281 19 redesigned the device to add physical cell-trapping structures to each well. The outcome of 282",

HeLa and HeLa S3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 309 and maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 310 serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 IU/mL penicillin\u2212streptomycin (Corning), in a 311 humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. 312Viruses. To generate EGFP-tagged poliovirus used in this work, pMo-EGFP-PV-WT plasmid 313 was linearized with ApaI and purified with QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Netherlands). 314With the linearized plasmid as the template, viral RNA was transcribed at 37\u00b0C for 5.5 hours in a 315 20-\u03bcL reaction medium containing 350 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 32 mM magnesium acetate, 40 mM 316 dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM spermidine, 28 mM nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), 0.025 \u00b5g/\u00b5L 317 linearized DNA, and 0.025 \u00b5g/\u00b5L T7 RNA polymerase. After removing magnesium 318 pyrophosphate in the mixture by centrifugation for 2 minutes, RNA concentration was measured 319 by scanning the gel at fluorescence mode with a Typhoon 8600 scanner (Promega, USA). Then, 5 320 \u00b5g of viral RNA were utilized to transfect HeLa cells cultured at 37\u00b0C by electroporation. Virus 321 was harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes, and 322 suspended in 0.5% nonidet P-40 (NP-40). For purification, the supernatant was mixed with 1 323 volume of 20% PEG-8000/1 M NaCl solution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After 324 centrifugation at 8000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the pellet was resuspended in PBS and filtered 325 with Centricon\u00ae Plus-70 (EMD Millipore, USA). Plaque assay was performed to determine the 326 virus titer. ",
