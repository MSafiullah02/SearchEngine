Since then, S-OIV has spread rapidly across the globe, resulting in sustained community transmission in more than 207 countries on five continents with over 322,482 cumulative cases and at least 7826 deaths up to November 22, 2009 [1]. The incubation period of S-OIV infection is usually 1\u20137 days, and the clinical manifestations often include a fever, cough, stethocatharsis, pharyngodynia, headache, myalgias, diarrhea and vomiting [2]. Severe cases will rapidly progress to respiratory failure or multiple organ failure [3]. Therefore, identification of early immunological parameters will be critical for the study of the pathogenesis of this disease.",

Moderate increases of pro-inflammatory activation in virus-infected patients may favor virus clearance. However, hyper-activated inflammatory responses may lead to detrimental effects for the host [4]. For example, it is known that the high mortality rate from the pathogenic avian influenza virus infections is a consequence of an overactive inflammatory response, and the severity of the disease is closely related with the virus-induced cytokine storm [5]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome further reinforces the concept in that an overactive inflammatory response is associated with progression of pulmonary infiltrates, necrosis and tissue destruction [6]. This abundance of virus-induced inflammatory cytokines after innate immunity activation can lead to subsequent antigen-nonspecific T cell activation in mice and human with viral infection [7], [8]. Furthermore, the pathogenesis induced by activated nonspecific T cells in liver or relative tissues has been demonstrated in human with chronic HIV, HBV or HCV infection [9], [10], [11], [12], in which type 1 IFN plays a crucial role in inducing systemic inflammation and loss of lymphocyte numbers in the early stages of viral infection [7], [9], [13], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. These studies provide evidence linking systemic inflammatory activation and activated nonspecific T cell induced tissue damage.",

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are immunosuppressive and play an important role in the regulation of immune responses [15]. IL-17-expressing CD4+ T (Th17) cells, producing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17, have been causally related both to chronic inflammation [16] and to host defenses against pulmonary microbial agents [17]. A recent report demonstrated that Th17 cells play an important role in protecting na\u00efve mice against lethal doses of influenza challenge [18], [19]. Furthermore, Th1 and Th17 hypercytokinemia as early host response signature has been observed in severe pandemic influenza [20]. However, whether the change of T helper subsets could bridge the inflammatory activation and T cell activation during host-pathogen interactions at an early stage of A/H1N1 infection has not been well-defined.",

As shown in Fig. 1A, patients infected with S-OIV clearly experienced T cell loss in peripheral blood during the acute stage of infection. The mean absolute CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts in healthy individuals were 1556, 8836, and 603 cells/\u03bcl, respectively; whereas those in patients with S-OIV infection were markedly lower, at 994, 492, and 410 cells/\u03bcl, respectively. Among the 53 patients, patients at early clinical onset showed lower T cell counts (649 cells/\u03bcl for CD3+, 304 cells/\u03bcl for CD4+, and 274 cells/\u03bcl for CD8+ T cells), and T cell counts were progressively increased in patients at the intermediate (1086 cells/\u03bcl for CD3+, 534 cells/\u03bcl for CD4+, and 444 cells/\u03bcl for CD8+ T cells) and late stages (1168 cells/\u03bcl for CD3+, 599 cells/\u03bcl for CD4+, and 476 cells/\u03bcl for CD8+ T cells). These data showed that S-OIV infection leads to a rapid depletion of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell at the early stage (1\u20133 days), followed by a rapid and significant restoration of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells at 4 days after the onset of illness. However, the disparate patterns of T cell restoration were observed in patients at the early and intermediate stages after oseltamivir therapy. As shown in Fig. 1, absolute cell counts almost doubled for CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets when compared within patients between the early and convalescent stages (1136 cells/\u03bcl for CD3+, 551 cells/\u03bcl for CD4+, and 465 cells/\u03bcl for CD8+ T cells); however, absolute cell counts for CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets showed a decreasing trend when compared within patients between the intermediate and convalescent stages (966 cells/\u03bcl for CD3+, 470 cells/\u03bcl for CD4+, and 393 cells/\u03bcl for CD8+ T cells), and we observed no significant differences in absolute cell counts for CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets within patients from the late and convalescent stages.",

As shown in Figs 2A and B, the distribution of Th1 and Th17 subsets in S-OIV-infected subjects differed from that of HC subjects. We found that the absolute cell counts of Th1, Th17 and Tregs cells were significantly decreased in S-OIV-infected patients versus HC individuals. In particular, patients at the convalescent stage had full-scale restoration of CD4+ T cells. To understand whether the loss of these cell subsets in patients with S-OIV infection was selective or simply due to generalized CD4+ T cell depletion, we investigated more specifically the relative frequencies of these subset populations and found that the percentage of Th1 cells was significantly increased in S-OIV-infected patients as compared with HC individuals (P\n = 0.003, Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the average Th1 frequency in patients at the convalescent stage was even further increased over that in patients at the early stage (P\n < 0.001). These data agree with previous reports that Th1 cells play an important role in viral clearance. In contrast, the average Th17 frequency at early clinical onset was significantly decreased in S-OIV-infected patients compared with that of HC subjects, but showed a gradual increase from early to late phase (Figs. 2A and C). However, there was no difference in Treg frequency between S-OIV-infected patients and HCs. These data suggest that Th17 cells are more prone to be depleted at an early stage after S-OIV infection.",

Further analysis indicated that these negative associations occurred only with Th17 frequency but not with the Th1 or Treg subsets. Together, these results demonstrate that the CD4 depletion and selective loss of Th17 cells, not Th1 or Treg cells, were strongly associated with increased CD4+ T immune activation at the early phase of S-OIV infection.",

As expected, the serum IFN-\u03b1 was highly up-regulated in S-OIV-infected patients when compared with healthy controls (Fig. 4A). Further analysis indicated that patients at the early stage had the lowest of serum concentrations of IL-17 (Fig. 4B). We then determined whether IFN-\u03b1 influence the IL-17-production of Th17 cells in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4C, we observed that the IL-17-production from CD4+ T cells in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 was significantly reduced. Surprisingly, we found that the IFN-\u03b3 secretions from CD4+ T cells were slightly increased in the presence of IFN-\u03b1. Pooled data confirmed that the results were consistent for five healthy controls from three independent detections (Fig. 4D).

Our results demonstrated that there was a rapid and generalized lymphopenia in patients with S-OIV at the early stage of infection. In patients who recovered from the initial A/H1N1 illness, an equally rapid and dramatic restoration of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts was seen in the peripheral blood. These data support the notion that early loss of T cells may allow for the antigen-specific expansion of T cells [7]. We also found that the numbers of the Th17 subset were relatively preferentially decreased in S-OIV-infected patients compared with other CD4+ T cell subsets (including IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells and FoxP3-positive Treg cells). Th17 cells play an important role in host defenses against pulmonary microbial agents, and a recent study further indicated that Th17 protects na\u00efve mice against lethal doses of influenza challenge [18], [19]. All these data suggest that Th17 cells might actively participate in the immune regulation of S-OIV-infected patients.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism of Th17 cell induced CD4+ T cell activation in S-OIV-infected patients remains unknown, the present study indicates that the loss of the Th17 subset may link the inflammatory response with T cell activation during early host-pathogen interactions. There are three pieces of evidence here to support this notion. First, similar to a recent report of macaques infected with SIV, the animal model of immunodeficiency virus infection similar to acute human HIV-1 infection [27], we found that there was a significantly decreased frequency of Th17 cells, and increased levels of IFN-\u03b1 in S-OIV-infected patients. In addition, the present study also found that it was the frequency of Th17 cells, not Treg cells, which was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell activation. Third, IFN-\u03b1, which is highly induced in acute infections in direct response to viral replication, exhibited a considerable inhibitory effect on IL-17-production of Th17 cells reminiscent of those found in S-OIV-infected patients at early phase. These results suggest that Th17 cells are closely associated with inflammatory activation and T cell activation in acute S-OIV infection. However, we observed there was no association of Th17 loss with the severity of S-OIV infection. Th17 cells produce a cocktail of cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [16], [17] and future studies should investigate whether these Th17 cells in S-OIV-infected patients are functionally skewed to enhance inflammatory cytokine or to decrease anti-inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "Notably, there is a difference in the time at which the responses were observed in the S-OIV-infected patients of this study and recent report regarding severe S-OIV infection and in the study performed on mice models. The IFN-induced T cell loses observed in mice models immediately after infection [7], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. By contrast, the S-OIV-infected patients are usually identified 7 days after S-OIV infection, when they become clinically symptomatic. Thus, although we found that the serum IFN-\u03b1 level was significantly higher at clinical onset of infection than that in healthy subjects, even loss of Th17 cells response in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 in healthy subject are reminiscent of those found in S-OIV-infected patients at early phase. The time difference suggested that the preferential decreased Th17 population in early S-OIV-infected patients may not simply be a direct result of IFN-induced attrition, an alternative explanation for the data is that the committed Th17 cells were still in peripheral blood with down-regulated synthesis of IL-17 in presence of IFN-\u03b1 or these Th17 cells migrated into the lung tissue or lymph nodes. In contrast to recent data published by Bermejo-Martin JF [20], we observed similar levels of IL-17 in plasma of S-OIV-infected patients. However, we observed no association between levels of IL-17 and the severity of S-OIV infection.",
