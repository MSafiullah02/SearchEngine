            "text": "Psychiatric consultations are requested for children in the inpatient pediatric setting for a wide variety of reasons. While some reasons overlap with requests made of adult psychiatric consultants, others are unique to the pediatric population or require a specific developmental approach. In 2016, Shaw and colleagues published the results of a survey of practice patterns completed by 64 independent pediatric C-L psychiatry services.2 The survey results highlighted the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric consultation to include suicide risk assessment, assistance in the diagnosis and management of medically unexplained symptoms, adjustment to medical illness, assessment for psychopharmacologic intervention, delirium, treatment non-adherence, and the management of children admitted to pediatric units to await psychiatric hospital placement (boarding).2 Thus, the role of the pediatric psychiatry consultant is a varied one and involves components both of primary psychiatric management and of close collaboration with the pediatric medical team. Moreover, child psychiatric consultants must be knowledgeable about the diagnosis and management of psychiatric diseases that are particularly prevalent in children, such as feeding and eating disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the subsequent sections, we review updates in common reasons for inpatient child psychiatric consultations and associated management strategies. Of note, while consultation for treatment non-adherence is of great importance given its associated high morbidity and mortality,2 this topic has been addressed in detail in a recent Cochrane review and will therefore not be covered in this update.4\n",

The most common root cause identified was shortcomings in suicide risk assessment. In 2016, TJC recommended screening all patients for suicidal ideation with a brief, standardized, and evidence-based screening tool.7 Therefore, for the pediatrician and pediatric C-L psychiatrist, utilization of such a tool is essential. Examples include the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) toolkit,8 Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),9 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),10 and Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R),11 all of which have evidence supporting their use in the pediatric patient population. 12 Using these tools, Brahmbhatt and colleagues developed streamlined clinical pathways for pediatric hospitals to implement efficient and evidence-based youth suicide assessment strategies in hospitalized patients.13 Services should be aware that these new recommendations may increase staff burden, time spent in screening, and documentation requirements. Thus, institutional accommodations may be needed.",

With the release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5), important revisions were made to the diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRDs), which are often a consideration in patients with medically unexplained symptoms. Whereas previously the diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder required the symptoms to be medically unexplained, this is no longer required. This change reflects current thinking about somatic symptom disorders, including the idea that these disorders can and often do exist in patients who suffer from organic medical conditions that also contribute to their symptoms, and that a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder should not be made simply because a patient\u2019s symptoms do not have an identifiable medical cause.14\n",

While rare, the incidence of medical child abuse is estimated at approximately 0.5 to 2.0 per 100,000 children; and most health care practitioners will encounter the condition at some point during their practice.16 Recent consensus has shifted away from the previous terminology of Munchausen syndrome by proxy or factitious disorder by proxy. Medical child abuse is a more broadly encompassing term used to classify when a child receives unnecessary and potentially harmful medical care as a result of a caregiver falsifying or inducing medical or psychological symptoms in the child.16 The shift from the Munchausen syndrome or factitious disorder by proxy terminology to that of medical child abuse or caregiver-fabricated illness represents a shift in focus on the child as a victim of abuse, rather than on the caregiver\u2019s motivation, which can be widely variable.16 Just as with SSRDs, recent guidance emphasizes that medical child abuse should not be a diagnosis of exclusion.16\n,\n17 If the primary team or consulting child and adolescent psychiatrist is concerned about medical child abuse as part of the differential diagnosis of a child\u2019s symptoms, a multidisciplinary team evaluation, including medical, psychiatric, child protection, and legal teams, should be completed.16 A pediatric C-L psychiatrist has an important role in both recognizing and treating psychopathology in the child, including potential sequelae of trauma related to the abuse, as well as working with the broader team to reverse the trend toward medicalization and minimize unnecessary medical intervention.",

The consulting pediatric psychiatrist should work with the primary medical team and neurologic consultants to determine diagnostic work-up, which can include serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoantibody panels, magnetic resonance imaging and other imaging modalities, and electroencephalogram. Given susceptibility to neuroleptic malignant syndrome in these patients, careful consideration must be given to treatment of psychiatric symptoms;21 sedating agents, such as benzodiazepines and valproic acid, may be most helpful.",

For instance, some developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Kleine-Levin syndrome, are associated with higher rates of catatonia; however, features of the underlying developmental disorder, such as stereotypic movements and decreased speech in autism spectrum disorder, may appear similar to signs of catatonia and must be carefully delineated.52 Moreover, Sorg et al. recently presented the case of a patient whose history of oppositional behavior led to misattribution of inappropriate laughter, echolalia, waxing/waning mutism, refusal to follow commands, and lack of cooperation, resulting in delayed identification and treatment of his catatonia syndrome.51 Additionally, certain symptoms of catatonia, such as behavioral agitation and urinary incontinence, may be more common in children than in adults;51 yet, these same symptoms can be associated with a variety of diagnoses in children.",

Exacerbating medications, such as dopamine D2 receptor-blocking agents like antipsychotics, should be discontinued and avoided. Should the patient\u2019s symptoms not improve with escalating doses of lorazepam, there is evidence that N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist medications, such as amantadine or memantine, can be useful to augment treatment.51 If symptoms remain refractory or the patient develops life-threatening symptoms, such as vital sign instability or other signs of malignant catatonia, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) should be considered; however, the practitioner should be mindful that some states have age restrictions and regulations in place that may limit access to ECT for pediatric patients.51\n",

One study based in a single medical center over an 18-month period found that 50% of children meeting criteria for involuntary psychiatric hold were admitted to the pediatric medical unit, where they received suboptimal care and accrued a cost of over $4000 per patient.57 Children with complex psychiatric needs, such as those with autism or developmental delays, as well as those with more acute psychiatric needs, may be particularly difficult to place into psychiatric facilities.54\n,\n56\n,\n58 Paradoxically, then, the children perhaps most in need of immediate psychiatric care are often the patients relegated to waiting the longest for placement.",

Recent consensus guidelines for pediatric psychiatric patients in the ED may serve as a reference for agitation contingency planning once patients become boarders; these guidelines suggest non-pharmacologic de-escalation techniques, such as verbal and behavioral de-escalation, as a first-line for agitation in children, followed by medication interventions ranging from diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and clonidine to atypical antipsychotic medications.59\n",

Sensory stimuli associated with the hospital environment that many medical providers take for granted, such as the sound of monitors or the feel of a hospital identification bracelet, have been shown to make hospitalization more stressful for patients with ASD, many of whom have sensory sensitivities.75 Finally, many individuals with ASD take comfort in strict adherence to routines, which are disrupted by hospitalization, and have difficulty in unfamiliar settings.",

The psychiatrist\u2019s role begins with a thorough, developmentally-informed assessment that gathers relevant information about the patient\u2019s level of cognitive functioning, preferred communication methods, past psychiatric history, active psychiatric symptoms, and risk of challenging behaviors such as agitation, aggression, or self-injury.74 The history should include a review of potential triggers for agitation or distress, as well as ways that the patient typically expresses distress and effective strategies for soothing the patient. This information, along with collateral from outpatient providers, can be integrated into a patient-specific care plan designed to prevent distress and provide contingencies for managing difficult behaviors that may arise.76 There are several elements commonly used in such plans that have been shown to be effective. Generally, these may involve facilitating communication, reducing anxiety associated with unfamiliar providers and routines, and sensory-based approaches to reduce triggers and employ helpful soothing strategies.77, 78, 79 A more detailed discussion of these strategies can be found in a 2019 review in Psychosomatics by Thom et al.\n73\n",

Psychosomatic medicine was the term for the psychiatric consultation subspecialty approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) in 2003 and was previously used by the national academy of the field, the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine (APM). More recently, concern grew that the term psychosomatic medicine was too narrow for the work of the subspecialty and implied that practitioners focus on somatoform disorders only, rather than the broad array of psychiatric manifestations of disease.98 As such, after several decades of growing momentum, and with support of its members and the American Psychiatric Association, the APM advocated for the subspecialty to be renamed Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, which was approved in October 2017; this was followed a month later by APM voting to change its name to the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry.98 The term consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry reflects the broader scope of clinical practice, beyond somatoform disorders, as well as the unique role of C-L psychiatrists in connecting with other medical providers to provide holistic patient care.",
