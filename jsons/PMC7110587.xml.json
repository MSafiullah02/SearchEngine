Respiratory tract infections are the most common infections transmitted between pilgrims, and the majority of pilgrims will develop one form of respiratory tract infection or another during their few weeks in Makkah and Madinah [3], [4]. Cough attack rates over 90% have been recorded among pilgrims from various nationalities [5], [6], [7]. Among ill pilgrims consulting at Mina primary health structures, 60% present with respiratory tract infection symptoms [8]. Respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of hospitalization in Saudi Hospitals during the Hajj, with a level as high as 57% in one study [9]. Pneumonia accounts for 20\u201340% of hospitalization in tertiary care structures [9], [10] and for 55\u201367% of admissions to intensive care units [11], [12].",

A 38.3% seroconversion rate was observed in one UK survey following participation in the Hajj (mostly due to influenza H3N2) while a 3.6% seroconversion rate was observed in one Iranian survey [34]. Differences in influenza vaccination coverage may have accounted for this discrepancy with 26.1% among UK pilgrims compared to 84.0% among Iranian pilgrims. The prevalence by PCR studies among arriving pilgrims ranged 0.6\u20137.5% and 0.5\u20137.8% after the Hajj, with most cases being influenza A. The prevalence of influenza after the Hajj was statistically higher than before the Hajj in two studies [39], [43]. Vaccination rates against influenza in these PCR-based studies ranged from 21.9 to 98.1%. Effect of vaccination on influenza detection prevalence was investigated in 5 studies and no statistically significant effect was observed with the following results: 30.0% in vaccinated pilgrims vs. 38.3% in unvaccinated pilgrims (OR = 0.61, p = 0.28) [31], 2.7% vs. 0 (no statistical test performed) [34], 7.4 vs. 8.5% (p > 0.05) [35], no significant differences were observed in two study where details were not provided [38], [43].",

We also show that these viruses have low carriage rates among arriving pilgrims while an increase is observed in the carriage rate following participation in the Hajj. This increase was statistically significant for several viruses in certain studies including influenza AH1N1 [43], influenza AH3N2 [39], rhinovirus [38], [43], coronavirus 229E [39], [43], coronavirus HKU1 and OC43 [43]. These cosmopolitan viruses are probably easily transmitted between pilgrims given the crowded conditions at the Holy Mosque and other religious sites around Mecca. The Holy Mosque's total capacity is 2 million and the average crowd density is at least four people per square meter and can reach levels of 6\u20138 people per square meter as people get closer to the Kaaba [47]. It is also likely that housing conditions at Mina encampment in tents of 50\u2013100 pilgrims play a role in the transmission of respiratory viruses [27]. Overall, these results show an acquisition of viruses following the Hajj with high carriage prevalence among departing pilgrims. This suggests that an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of common respiratory pathogens. Of note, emerging pathogens like SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus were not isolated from Hajj pilgrims until now, although rare cases of MERS have been reported among Umrah pilgrims [48]. Mixed viral infections were relatively rare; however it depends mostly on the number of viruses investigated. The proportion of mixed viral infections reached 10.4% in a study where 21 different viruses were tested [43].",

            "text": "Since therapeutic options are limited in the context of respiratory viral infections [49] prevention is of paramount importance. Influenza vaccination is recommended to Hajj pilgrims by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health [50]. In this review, no significant effect of influenza vaccination was observed on the carriage of influenza virus in individual studies and the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine was very variable. The apparent lake of efficacy of vaccination against influenza in the context of the Hajj may result of a mismatch of circulating strains with vaccine strains [51]. The effectiveness of influenza vaccine was assessed in pooled metadata from six studies included in the present review [16], [20], [21], [23], [30], [36] by other authors [51]; influenza was significantly effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza (risk ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.41\u20130.75; p < 0.001). However a definitive conclusion should be not drawn from this analysis [51]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, cough etiquette, social distancing, and contact avoidance can be effective in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses from person to person [52] and are therefore recommended to Hajj pilgrims by national public health agencies [50]. However, evidence of their effectiveness at the Hajj are limited and inconclusive and prospective cohort studies are required to confirm whether or not such non-pharmaceutical interventions are relevant for interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory viruses during the annual Hajj pilgrimage [53]. A cluster-randomized controlled trial is being conducted to provide valuable evidence on the efficacy of facemasks in preventing viral respiratory tract infections during the Hajj [54].",

There was an in important heterogeneity in studies in regards of study populations, clinical criteria for respiratory infections and diagnostic methods applied. The design of surveys conducted so far among pilgrims does not allow us to ascertain the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of respiratory symptoms and their potential role in the severity of the symptoms. The frequency of secondary bacterial infection could not be evaluated from the available studies since most surveys only addressed virus carriage and the number of viruses investigated was limited in many studies. The role of co-infection with viruses and bacteria warrants further investigation using ideally a paired cohort-survey design, allowing assessment of acquisition rate of a large panel of pathogens with sequential sampling and careful recording of clinical data associated with the highly common \u201cHajj cough\u201d [55].",
