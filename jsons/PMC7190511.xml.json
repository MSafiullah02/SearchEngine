These overlapping features mimicking a viral infection and Grover disease have already been described in patients with simultaneous Grover and Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform eruption (3,4). At the time of the onset of their cutaneous eruption, these patients were also on no new drug treatment. The others developed cutaneous lesions during hospitalization and were treated with levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine that are not recognized to cause a diffuse lymphocytic vasculitis with microthrombi formation.",

            "text": "Among skin pathologies in which a virus is implicated, we can see various types of manifestations in the cutaneous district involved. Frequently, it is merely an exanthema indicating a hematogenous spreading of the virus through the cutaneous vascular system. The next step could create activation of the immune system with mobilization of lymphocytes and Langerhans cells patrolling that run through the skin-lymph node path. If the virus swarm induces the creation of immune complexes, this can lead CD4 + T helper lymphocytes to produce cytokines, like IL-1, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, and to recruit eosinophils, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells leading a lymphocytic thrombophilic arteritis (5). Sepsis or severe viral infections could activate the cytokine cascade inducing a CID phenomenon (6). Just like we observed in the skin and in the lung and kidneys of COVID + patients. However, there are underhanded viral attacks that probably induce a modification in the structure of the keratinocyte, which is destroyed by the cytotoxic lymphocytes, almost resembling the well- known ancient trick of the \"Trojan horse.\" In lichen striatus, a viral alteration of the keratinocyte clones along the Blaschko's lines has been hypothesized (7,8,9). In fact, in its classic form, it can be observed histologically a band like dermatitis with lymphocyte satellitosis destroying the keratinocytes. Also, here we have the presence of Langerhans nests. Ultimately, the HSV is suspected of provoking stimulation of immunopathological mechanisms in erythema multiforme. The herpes virus could play a role in autoimmune cross-reactivity (10), triggering the keratinocyte that activates IL-1, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, recruiting cytotoxic and NK cells that target the keratinocytes itself. Histopathological examination of lung biopsy of COVID + pneumonia indicates a severe damage of the alveolar epithelial cell floating in the alveolar space just like in bullous severe erythema multiforme in which ballooning keratinocytes detach from the spinous layer.",
