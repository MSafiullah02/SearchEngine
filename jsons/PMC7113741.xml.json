            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is one of six known porcine coronaviruses (CoVs) causing diseases in pigs (Gong et al., 2017; Wang and Zhang, 2016). PHEV typically affects pigs less than three weeks of age and the clinical syndromes include the vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and encephalomyelitis (Quiroga et al., 2008). PHEV was first isolated from suckling piglets suffering from encephalomyelitis in Canada in 1962 (Greig et al., 1962). PHEV has since been identified in many countries of Europe, Asia, and America (Cartwright et al., 1969; Dong et al., 2014; Forman et al., 1979; Hirahara et al., 1987; Mengeling, 1975; Pensaert and Callebaut, 1974; Quiroga et al., 2008; Rho et al., 2011). Although PHEV infection has been endemic in different countries for decades and the primary route of PHEV infection is through upper and lower respiratory tracts, only few reports suggest an association of the virus with respiratory disease in swine (Cutlip and Mengeling, 1972). Recently, we have demonstrated that PHEV caused an influenza-like illness (ILI) in affected pigs and provided evidence for the role of PHEV as a respiratory pathogen (Lorbach et al., 2017). In that study, a significantly higher positive rate 38.7% (108 of 279 pigs) was observed in pigs at the Michigan fairs compared to 4.1% (23 of 560 pigs) in Indiana and Ohio, indicating the PHEV-associated epizootic behavior in the Michigan fairs (Lorbach et al., 2017).",

The first two thirds of the PHEV genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) encoding the replicases, and the remaining part of the genome encodes six structural proteins (hemagglutinin-esterase protein, HE; spike glycoprotein, S; envelope protein, E; membrane protein, M; nucleocapsid protein, N, and N2) and three non-structural (NS) proteins (NS2, NS4.9, and NS12.7). Previous genomic characterization and analysis reveal that PHEV is closely related to bovine CoV and human CoV OC43, and have identified truncated NS2 and NS4.9 genes in the PHEV-VW572 strain (Vijgen et al., 2006). Prior to our study (Lorbach et al., 2017), only one complete PHEV genome sequence (PHEV-VW572) was available in GenBank. We completed the full genomic sequencing of 10 PHEV isolates, and the analyses of complete genomic sequences showed that PHEV formed three distinct genotypes. Interestingly, genotypes 1 had deletions in NS2 and NS4.9, while genotype 3 showed no deletion and genotype 2 has a large deletion in the NS2 gene (Lorbach et al., 2017). The prevalence and distribution of three genotypes remain unknown in pigs in the United States.",

These porcine coronaviruses cause neurologic (PHEV), digestive (TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV, PEAV, PHEV), and respiratory diseases (PRCV, PHEV). VWD and encephalomyelitis caused by PHEV are common and have experimentally been reproduced in pigs (Mengeling and Cutlip, 1976). In contrast, only a few studies including ours report that PHEV causes respiratory problems in pigs. In our previous study, we reported that influenza-like illness in market-age pigs was strongly linked to PHEV (Lorbach et al., 2017). Field and experiment infection studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of respiratory diseases caused by PHEV.",
