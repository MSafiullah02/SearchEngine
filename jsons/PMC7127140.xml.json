            "text": "Although somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has several limitations, including low cloning efficiency, it is still a promising method of producing transgenic animals. We are striving to improve feline SCNT, with a long-term goal of efficiently producing genetically identical cats. Nuclear transfer has progressed from a novel technology to: (1) a widely used technique for generating identical individuals; (2) a model for understanding the cellular and molecular aspects of nuclear reprogramming; and most recently, (3) a means to produce embryonic stem cells for potential use in cell-based therapies [1]. Nuclear transfer in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) was first demonstrated by the birth of a cloned kitten following the transfer of embryos that were reconstructed by inserting cumulus cells into enucleated oocytes [2]. Feline SCNT cloning has a potential application for preserving endangered felids [1], [3]. Most wild felids are threatened, and the feasibility of using this technology to preserve endangered felids was demonstrated with the birth of African wildcat (Felis silivestris lybica) cloned kittens [1]. Moreover, despite the high rates of fetal and newborn mortality, surviving cloned cats are generally normal and healthy [2], [4], [5]. Serial cloning has been successful in several species, including pigs [6], [7], mice [8], and bulls [9], [10].",

Moreover, second-generation cloning of existing cloned fetuses or animals has the distinct advantage of reproducing unique genetic characteristics. For example, transgenic cell populations that were produced by random gene insertion exhibit many different transgene integration sites and copy numbers. Using these transgenic cell populations in SCNT could facilitate production of fetuses or animals derived from a small subset of unique cells that would be difficult to isolate from the transgenic donor fetuses or animals. Although serial cloning of adult mice, cattle, and pigs has been reported [7], [14], [15], there are no reports on second-generation cloning of felid species. The objective of the present study was to determine the efficiency of second-generation cloning, namely, producing cloned cats using skin cells from an adult cloned cat.",

The protruding first polar body and chromatin plate were removed with a beveled micropipette mounted on micromanipulators (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), while being viewed with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan) using Hoffman modulation contrast optics. Successful enucleation was confirmed by staining oocytes with 5 \u03bcg/mL of Hoechst 33342 and observing them with a fluorescent microscope under ultraviolet light. Donor cells were then dissociated using 1% trypsin\u2013EDTA and placed in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free D-PBS supplemented with 0.3% BSA (fatty acid free, A-6003). Micromanipulation was used to place a single donor cell nucleus into the perivitelline space of each enucleated oocyte. The cytoplast/cell couples were equilibrated in 0.3 M mannitol containing 0.1 mM Mg2+ and transferred to an electrofusion chamber containing the same medium. Cell fusion was induced by applying 2.0 kV/cm and 20 \u03bcs DC pulses (2\u00d7) delivered by an electro cell fusion generator (Nepagene, Chiba, Japan). The couples were removed from the fusion chamber, washed and incubated in TCM199 supplemented with 0.3% BSA at 38 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. One hour after electrofusion, the fused couples were equilibrated in 0.3 M mannitol containing 0.1 mM Ca2+ and 0.1 mM Mg2+, placed into a fusion chamber containing the same medium, and electropulsed by applying 1.0 kV/cm and 20 \u03bcs DC pulses, 0.1 s apart (2\u00d7).

We previously reported that SCNT can be used to produce viable first generation cloned cats [4], [5]. In the current study, we tested whether it was possible to produce viable second-generation cloned cats. In that regard, SCNT using skin cells that were collected from a 6-month-old cloned cat (G1 cloned cat) resulted in seven second-generation cloned cats. Their clonal status was confirmed by nine sets of microsatellite markers. Furthermore, the efficiency of the production of second-generation cloned cats was similar to the clones derived from the G0 donor cat (26 and 20% delivery rate in the cloned and second-generation cloned cats, respectively). Similarly, in previous second-generation cloning studies in mice, cumulus cells derived from donor mice and their adult clones produced clones equally as efficiently [8]; 2.8 and 2.0% of the transferred cloned and re-cloned embryos developed to term. There were no changes in the cloned mice that influenced the subsequent cloning efficiency [8]; however, the success rate dropped in successive cloned generations, such that re-cloning was no longer successful after the fifth generation [15]. Another re-cloning study using cattle examined embryos that were generated by SCNT using adult cells from a bull and fetal cells from the bull's clone [9]. Regardless of the nucleus donor, 28% of the fused embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Moreover, based on DNA analysis and morphological observations, the re-cloned fetus that was removed at 56 d of pregnancy appeared to be normal [10]. Our data were consistent with these observations, and indicated that the efficiency of second-generation cloned cat production was similar to that of first-generation cloning.",
