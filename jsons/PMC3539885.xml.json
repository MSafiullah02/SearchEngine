To estimate the population of pregnant/postpartum women at risk during each influenza period, first the number of women who were pregnant in a year was calculated by multiplying the total number of confinements in that year\n[16] by 40/52, as an average pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. Second, to determine the number of women at risk during a given week in that year, this number was divided by 52.

Excess intensive care admissions were estimated using a Serfling-type approach\n[17] to account for the baseline or underlying seasonality that occurs even when influenza epidemics are absent. A regression model was fit using robust regression (SAS ROBUSTREG), which limits the influence of outliers caused by influenza epidemics and other short term changes in mortality and thus does not require removal of the influenza periods to estimate the baseline, which is the traditional approach. This method has been used previously to estimate excess mortality due to influenza epidemics\n[18,19]. The traditional approach was not used as it is sensitive to the time period chosen to be excluded for estimation of the baseline. The two methods have been shown to give similar results, with the robust regression approach giving more conservative estimates\n[18].",

The perception of 2009 as a more severe influenza year than 2007 could be due to a number of factors, including the rapid progression of the epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Australia, the intense media attention and uncharacteristic reporting of counts of confirmed cases and deaths, and the apparent increase in incidence of clearly influenza-related severe acute respiratory distress in younger adults compared with seasonal influenza epidemics. The rapid increase of the 2009 epidemic was followed by an equally rapid decline, thus tempering the final impact. In seasonal influenza years such as 2007, in which older persons were at greater risk of poor outcomes of influenza infection, the role of influenza may be less clear. A large proportion of patients hospitalised with seasonal influenza have symptoms uncharacteristic of a classic influenza syndrome\n[20,21].",

Even so, the 2009 period was highly unusual in that increases in influenza-associated intensive care admissions were observed only in people under 65 years. Older people were relatively protected, compared to normal seasonal influenza epidemic periods. Studies both in Australia and internationally have found that older populations tended to have a high prevalence of pre-existing cross-reacting influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies, while few younger people had such protection\n[23-25]. Hence, the all ages excess rate in 2009 was small when compared to 2007, as the increased rate in younger people was offset by the unusually low rate in older people. This was not the case in 2007, where rates were higher than expected in all age groups. A study from Denmark examining all influenza-associated hospital admissions also did not find an increase during the first epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus compared with seasonal influenza, except in people younger than 65 years\n[26]. Our findings are consistent with those of a study in a US hospital that found that patients at greatest risk of complications from seasonal influenza tend to be older, with a mean age of 75 years\n[27]. The 2010 epidemic, the first season following the arrival of pandemic influenza continued to be dominated by the pandemic strain. This season was characterised by low influenza activity and very low influenza-related ICU use.",

The main strength of this study is that it is population based which allows complete capture of all intensive care admissions in NSW residents. However, there is certainly some difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying admissions associated with influenza infection over time. There are many non-influenza causes of respiratory illness, both infectious and non-infectious. Other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, may have also been circulating during the influenza periods. We controlled for these non-influenza factors using the Serfling method. However, a limitation of the Serfling method is that it generates a rigid expectation of non-influenza seasonal illness. While the sinusoidal model follows the background seasonal pattern, some variation in non-influenza causes of illness from year-to-year could lead to some over- or underestimation in some years. Other time series methods for estimating influenza-attributable health outcomes are available, such as a combined Serfling-Poisson model that incorporates virology data, but these have been shown to produce broadly similar results\n[33,34].

In addition, this increased use may reflect the younger age distribution in 2009, given that clinicians may be more likely to use extreme measures on younger patients.",

Prior to 2009 specific testing for influenza in ICUs was uncommon, and during 2009 we believe that pandemic awareness amongst clinicians promoted testing for influenza, and increased the likelihood that influenza was recorded as part of the diagnosis, as evidenced by Figure\n1. As well, a shift between 2007 and 2009 from the use of immunofluorescence for the detection of influenza to the more sensitive nucleic acid testing may have contributed to the increased rate of influenza diagnosis in 2009.",

In 2009, relatively high use of intensive care among young to middle-aged adults was offset by low use among adults aged over 65 years.
