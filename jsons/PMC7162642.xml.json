This shows that 70% of all deaths are in the over-70-years age group, so it is important that they are protected. However, nearly two thirds (64%) of the remaining deaths occur in the 60\u201369 years age group. This age group is not being particularly protected and includes many who are working on the frontline. Indeed, health-care workers have even been encouraged to come out of retirement to assist.",
