The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in shortages of critical supplies, including PPE [2]. These shortages have led many facilities to consider strategies to extend or reuse PPE, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have provided guidance on the acceptability of extended use or limited reuse of N95 respirators [3]. The guidance document includes a discussion of potential concerns regarding these practices, particularly the risk for contact transmission from touching a contaminated respirator [3].",

The goal of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of UV-C light and a high-level disinfection cabinet for decontamination of N95 respirators. For UV-C light, we studied a 1-minute cycle delivered by a UV-C decontamination box that could potentially be used for rapid decontamination after each removal of a respirator and a 30-minute treatment delivered by a room decontamination device that might be used once daily. The high-level disinfection cabinet generates submicron droplets of aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide and has been shown to be very effective in eliminating microorganisms from hard surfaces in patient rooms and on portable equipment [12\u201313]. We hypothesized that the disinfection cabinet would be very effective while UV-C light might have reduced efficacy in contrast to previous reports that evaluated microorganism reductions on steel disk carriers or hard surfaces in healthcare settings [14\u201315]. Soft, irregular surfaces may present a challenge for UV-C decontamination due to the potential for areas of shadowing and absorption of organisms into sites with reduced delivery of UV-C [16].",

The purpose of this assessment was to determine the relative susceptibility of bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2 to UV-C in comparison to bacterial and fungal organisms listed in Table 1. For each pathogen, 10-\u03bcL aliquots containing ~106 colony-forming units (CFU) or plaque-forming units (PFU) in phosphate-buffered saline were spread to cover steel disks 20 mm in diameter. The steel disk carriers were positioned 32 inches from a room decontamination device (Moonbeam 3, Diversey, Fort Mill, SC) that was operated for a 90-second cycle or 180-second cycle for more UV-C resistant organisms. The relatively short cycle times were chosen in order to allow a comparison in log10 reductions (ie, complete elimination of the inoculum was common for susceptible organisms at higher UV-C doses). The disks were positioned at a height of 3 feet and oriented vertically in parallel with the UV-C bulbs. The disks were processed as previously described [12\u201313]. Log10 CFU or PFU reductions were calculated by comparing recovery from UV-C-exposed carriers to untreated controls.",

Moreover, the single cycle resulted in >6-log10 reductions in MRSA and C. difficile spores inoculated on the respirator, despite greater UV-C resistance of these organisms on solid surfaces. Taken together, these data suggest that reduction in viral pathogens on N95 respirators might be challenging, in part because the small size of viral particles allows them to penetrate beneath the respirator surface to a greater extent than bacteria resulting in partial protection from technologies such as UV-C and aerosolized peracetic acid.

Lore et al. [4] and Heimbuch et al. [6] found that moist heat (65\u00b0C for 20 minutes) was effective for inactivation of influenza virus. Darnell et al.

Further studies are currently being conducted to evaluate the impact of multiple different decontamination methods on N95 performance such as filtration efficiency. Second, we applied the test organisms in a liquid suspension directly onto the surface of the N95 respirators and spread them over a relatively small surface area with a loop. We cannot exclude the possibility that the technologies would have been more effective if the inoculum was spread out over a larger surface area; spreading of an organism inoculum over a larger surface area has been shown to increase the efficacy of UV-C light [14\u201315]. It has also been suggested that the method of deposition may influence results, and that methods that more closely mimic droplet and aerosol deposition on respirators should be used [6]. For the disinfection cabinet, we conducted additional experiments in which the inoculum was applied to the entire respirator as a fine spray with similar results (data not shown). Third, the testing was conducted as a laboratory simulation. Additional studies are needed to evaluate decontamination of N95 respirators used in clinical settings. Fourth, UV-C was less effective in our study than has been reported in previous investigations of UV-C for decontamination of influenza virus on respirators [4, 6]. This may be related to differences in methodology or to greater UV-C susceptibility of influenza virus than the bacteriophages studied. Previous studies suggest that viruses vary considerably in susceptibility to UV-C [28]. Fifth, we cannot exclude the possibility that a higher UV-C dose might have resulted in greater efficacy. However, there is evidence that very high UV-C doses may adversely affect N95 respirator performance and structural integrity [10]. Sixth, we only studied 3 brands of N95 respirators and 3 methods of decontamination. We are currently evaluating the effectiveness of several other technologies. Finally, we did not include data on decontamination of other types of PPE. However, testing with surgical face masks yielded similar results (data not shown).",

However, efficacy varied with different respirator types and with different locations on the respirator. A high-level disinfection cabinet using submicron droplets of aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide was substantially more effective for decontamination of N95 respirators and with 3 consecutive cycles or a single extended cycle achieved >6-log10 reductions meeting criteria for disinfection. Further work is urgently needed to determine the impact of decontamination technologies on respirator function.",
