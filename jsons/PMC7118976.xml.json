Although it is commonly recommended that surgical masks be used on potentially infectious patients during periods of patient triage or transportation, it is readily acknowledged that such masks do not provide full protection from infection transmission.3 Standard N95 masks may be more effective in containing potentially infectious particles but will not be suitable for most influenza patients ill enough to seek medical care, because these patients will require oxygen (O2) therapy. O2 therapy is commonly administered with the nonrebreathing O2 mask, which is not designed to contain any respiratory droplets. In fact, these masks may actually increase the dispersal of respiratory droplets by jetting them through the mask\u2019s open side vents.8, 9 Somogyi et al8 reported that the use of the Hi-Ox80 mask, which is designed specifically to deliver high fractional inspired O2 concentrations (FiO2), can provide respiratory isolation if a bacterial-viral filter is placed on its outlet port. However, the mask is expensive, unfamiliar to many, and not likely to be widely available in numbers sufficient for use as a first-line O2 mask in the case of a pandemic.",

Our approach in designing such a mask was to add a nonrebreathing O2 manifold to the familiar N95 mask, which provides excellent viral and bacterial filtration and is already widely distributed. We tested the effectiveness of this \u201cN95 O2 mask\u201d in providing supplemental O2 and compared it to the nonrebreathing mask and to the Hi-Ox80 mask. We then tested the effectiveness of the N95 O2 mask in protecting the wearer from microparticles in the environment and compared it to the criterion standard in this regard, the N95 mask. We also tested how well the N95 and the N95 O2 masks retained microparticles originating from inside the mask. Finally, although the nonrebreathing mask is not designed to provide respiratory protection or isolation, we included it in particle testing because it is common, at least in our institutions, to find health care workers who believe it confers some level of protection to the wearer or the health care provider.",

In phase 2, we tested the protection function (ie, the ability of the mask to filter microparticles from ambient air) of the N95 mask, the N95 O2 mask, and the nonrebreathing mask. In phase 3, we tested the masks\u2019 isolation function (ie, the effectiveness of each mask in containing microparticles generated inside the mask). We did not include the Hi-Ox80 in particle testing, because its protective and isolation function would be that of the particular filter placed on its expiratory port, and this information is already well documented (eg, see Dellamonica et al10).

We chose these O2 flow rates for 2 reasons. First, the Hi-Ox80 is rated to provide clinically useful FiO2 at these flows.11 Second, using lower flows with O2 masks may be necessary in case O2 supplies become limited, as when treating mass casualties (eg, during a pandemic). Subjects were not told of the O2 flow being administered. Once end-tidal PCO2 (PetCO2) and end-tidal PO2 (PetO2) reached a steady state (defined as less than a 2 mm Hg change in PetCO2 during 2 minutes), minute ventilation, PetCO2, and PetO2 were recorded for 2 minutes. Subjects were then asked to increase their minute ventilation sufficiently to reduce their PetCO2 by 10 mm Hg below their resting values (hyperventilation) and maintain that level of PetCO2. Once steady state was achieved at the target PetCO2, minute ventilation, PetCO2, and PetO2 were again recorded for 2 minutes. Subjects then reestablished steady-state resting ventilation, after which the test was repeated for the other 2 O2 flow rates. After testing the Hi-Ox80 at all 3 flow rates, the other 2 masks were tested (in random order) using the same protocol. The Hi-Ox80 mask was tested first because it is the only mask that permits measurement of minute ventilation. We were then able to use the PetCO2 to match the minute ventilation when testing the other masks.",

Six of the subjects were hospital employees who had been previously fit-tested with N95 masks. We therefore used the same model of N95 mask for their tests. The remaining 4 subjects who were not previously fit-tested were arbitrarily supplied with the 3M model 1870. Although there is a possibility this may have introduced variability in our data, the arbitrary use of masks simulates cases in which this mask would be applied to a patient as an infectious barrier. Each mask was prepared in advance by inserting a gas sampling port into the mask material (Figure 2). The particle generator was turned on and infused microparticles freely into the closed room for 20 minutes before subject testing to increase the atmospheric particle concentration in the room to more than 200/cm3. The test mask was placed on the subject\u2019s face, and subjects were instructed to breathe normally.

It appears that influenza is transmitted by droplets (>10 \u03bcm), aerosolized droplet nuclei (<10 \u03bcm), and by direct and indirect contact (see Bridges et al16 and Salgado et al17 for reviews). During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, it was assumed that reducing the dispersal of respiratory droplets from infected patients would help control the spread of infection. To this end, the World Health Organization guidelines state: \u201csuspected cases should wear surgical masks until SARS is excluded.\u201d3 Health Canada guidelines similarly recommend that a surgical mask be placed on the patient \u201cuntil SARS is excluded or the patient is admitted into the room.\u201d18 However, it is also recognized that a surgical mask \u201cdoes not provide adequate respiratory protection to the wearer [ie, health care worker] if the infection is airborne.\u201d Recent studies in vitro have demonstrated that surgical masks can allow the penetration of more than 80% of virions 27.5 nm in diameter15\u2014besides those that escape from the gaps in the mask seal to the face. The same would obviously apply to the isolation function of a surgical mask when worn by a contagious patient.

Indeed, increased airflow resistance and the perception of increased work of breathing were commonly experienced by health care workers after prolonged N95 mask use during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. The increased resistance to breathing is likely due to moisture obstructing the pores in the mask material. Increased breathing resistance would reduce the ability of breathless patients to tolerate long-term use of the N95 mask. Although no detailed studies evaluating the duration of effectiveness of the N95 mask have been done,21 these considerations indicate that the N95 O2 mask may be best suited for short-term use, such as during ambulance transport, hospital triage, and transport from one hospital ward to another (eg from the patient room to the diagnostic imaging department). On the other hand, the inspiratory flow resistance may actually be less than that of the original N95 because the N95 O2 mask includes an O2 reservoir that provides the major part of the inspiratory volume, leaving only small volumes at low flows at end inspiration to be inhaled through the mask filter material.",

Furthermore, the modification of the N95 mask for O2 delivery retains the same filtration function as the N95 mask. This is the first study to confirm that the N95 mask, as well as our modified version of the mask, is effective in retaining microparticles originating inside the mask in vivo. Assuming that the kinetics of microparticle distribution studied in humans is a suitable model to study the risk of transfer of infection in humans, we conclude that for O2-requiring patients, the N95 O2 mask appears to provide protection and isolation performance equivalent to that of the N95 mask, whereas the nonrebreathing mask would provide none at all. Additional clinical studies are needed to confirm that O2 administration through this N95 O2 mask is well tolerated by patients and that its use actually reduces the risk of disease transmission from infectious patients to health care workers.",
