The role of \u03b2-CD-SO3H as the catalyst has been confirmed when a similar reaction was carried out in the absence of catalyst (Table 4, entry 1), giving only 60% yield with a longer reaction time 2 h. It indicates that \u03b2-CD-SO3H not only improves the yield of the product but also accelerates the rate of reaction. The significant presence of \u03b2-CD-SO3H has a great influence on the reaction time as well as the yield (Table 4, entry 3). Temperature plays an important role, as at low temperature there is only a trace amount of product formed and required longer reaction time and as the temperature increases from 40 \u00b0C to reflux the yields also increase with decrease in reaction time (Table 3).",
