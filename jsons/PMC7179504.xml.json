The rapidly growing interoperable clinical datasets, including electronic health records (EHR), administrative and claims records, and human phenotype data collected from clinical research studies, present unprecedented opportunities for developing high-throughput methods for electronic phenotyping. The term phenotyping is still young and evolving, emerging around 2006 when the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program was launched in the United States and directed significant effort into phenotyping using EHR data [2]. Meanwhile, the biomedical informatics research community has been exploring electronic phenotyping solutions for decades, given the essential roles electronic phenotyping plays in disease knowledge discovery, application, and clinical research. Early phenotyping research focused primarily on case ascertainment or cohort identification [3]. In contrast, deep phenotyping shifted the focus from identification to characterization, which aims to deliver precise and comprehensive characterization of observable traits representing unique morphological, biochemical, physiological, or behavioral properties of the identified patient populations [4]. Deep phenotyping brings us a step closer on the path towards Precision Medicine via the development of precise disease classification systems. Consequently, the task of deep phenotyping poses the following new requirements.",

These traits are occasionally available in structured coded data but more often can only be accurately communicated as clinical text.

Therefore, the extracted phenotypes need to be normalized using various clinical terminologies or ontologies such as HPO (The Human Phenotype Ontology), ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, and SNOMED-CT. This requirement is at odds with the first requirement because the existing semantic knowledge resources have varying concept coverage and concept granularities, posing challenges for concept normalization in addition to the limitations noted with the first requirement. Consequently, creating code sets for a phenotype has become a foundational building block and yet the most time-consuming bottleneck in the knowledge engineering process for deep phenotyping. Since clinical databases tend to be heterogeneous, empirical knowledge of data sources and clinical processes is critical for identifying useful codes that have high sensitivity and specificity at a given site [7]. This heterogeneity also creates barriers to portability and interoperability of solutions leveraging distributed big clinical data for clinical phenotyping [8]. Standards beyond terminologies and ontologies at a higher level, such as common data models, promise to meet some of these needs, but efforts to improve existing widely adopted standards are still warranted.",
