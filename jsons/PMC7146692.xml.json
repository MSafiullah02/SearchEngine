The use of topical products containing purified omental lipids will help in improving skin barrier function, repairing the epithelial cell membrane, and increasing microcirculation.4 These products are also useful to prevent the development of pressure injuries and may be used after removing the medical devices as well the nonadherent dressings (soft silicone/paraffin).",
