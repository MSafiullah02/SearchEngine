Before the emergence of COVID-19, an American oncologist and bioethicist, E. Emanuel, sparked some controversy [6] after writing about his plan to self-impose a cut-off of 75 years for access to any 'curative' treatment and accepting only 'palliative' treatment. 6 Such proposals echoed the previous 65 year cut-off advocated by D. Callahan [7] , and even arguments about the existence of a duty to die [8] .",

For example, in Texas, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, said he would be willing to die to preserve the US economy from COVID-19 public health measures: \"as someone who turns 70 next week, he was in the high-risk group, but [ \u2026 ] he was willing to give up his life for his six grandchildren\". 7 In Italy, Father Giuseppe Berardelli, 72, died after choosing to give his respirator to a younger coronavirus patient. 8 The importance of protecting older people An important argument against potential age-related euthanasia or suicide and against the dangerous and immoral stigmatisation of aging, is the fact that older people should have the same rights as others to receive high-quality health care and the rights not to be spurred especially by key opinion leaders -to consider their own death as something good. Moreover, not all (older) individuals have the same clinical, psychosocial and other contextual features and expectations. That is, what could be good for Emanuel, Callahan, Patrick and Berardelli may not be good for others. A 70-year-old patient may have a better chance of survival and benefit more from intensive or other forms of medical treatment than a 30-year-old one. Notably there are studies showing how the so called \"oldest old\"i.e. patients 90 years old or olderwith early stage lung cancer can benefit from surgery [10] . Even in the context of the current pandemic, there is revealing news, e.g. in Italy a 101-yearold man 9 and a 102-year-old woman 10 These examples are also in line with the WHO 'Active Aging' policy framework, that is \"the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age\" [11] .",

On the one hand, older people are cajoled, especially for business reasons (the silver economy); on the other hand, as soon as the younger generation is under pressure, older people run the risk of being stigmatised or discriminated [13] . It is also important to highlight that such forms of discrimination can pit one generation against the other, seriously impoverishing the whole fabric of societies.",

One way to do so is to respect the individual person, going beyond categories such as age or age groups, and to promote intergenerational equity and solidarity by fostering connectedness across different generations.",
