In gastrointestinal cancer, accumulating immunohistochemical and in vitro evidence indicated that epithelial CEACAM1 expression is associated with tumor metastasis and progression [8\u201318]. However, little information is available concerning the serum CEACAM1, especially in gastrointestinal cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths [19].

            "text": "In humans, CEACAM1 exists in 12 known isoforms resulting from differential splicing and proteolytic processing [20,21]. CEACAM1 isoforms differ with respect to the number of extracellular Ig-like domains, membrane anchorage, and the length of their cytoplasmic tails. There are two major kinds of CEACAM1 splice isoforms, i.e. CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S, which differ in their cytoplasmic domains [22]. The CEACAM1-L isoform, with the long cytoplasmic domain, contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) which generally transmit inhibitory signals [12,23]. The S isoform lacks the ITIM motifs but contain sequences that can bind with calmodulin, tropomyosin, and globular actin, which transduce stimulating signals and regulate interactions with the cytoskeleton [24]. As such, the CEACAM1-L isoform is functionally inhibitory and the most commonly reported isoform [25]. In most cell types and tissues, CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S are expressed together, but at characteristically different ratios [26,27]. However, very little information is available concerning the CEACAM1 isoform expression patterns in cancer. Such information would be valuable, as it has been demonstrated that these two isoforms can mutually regulate the activity of each other [28,29].",

The specificity of anti-CEACAM1 antibody was tested by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Briefly, sections were dewaxed, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in a hydrogen peroxide solution (3%) for 10 min, followed by antigen retrieval. After being washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 5 min, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies in a humidity chamber overnight at 4\u00b0C. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) in a humidified chamber for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. After being washed, the streptavidin-peroxidase complex reagent (StrepABComplex/HRP Duet, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was added and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, the sections were incubated with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbozole solution for 15 min, and then immersed in running tap water, counterstained with haematoxylin for 1 min, rinsed with tap water, and then immersed in a series of alcohol baths with increasing concentrations. Finally, slides were covered with coverslips and examined under a microscope. The primary antibody was omited for negative controls.",

According to the odds ratio (OR) value, the CEACAM1 level is better for lower gastrointestinal cancer than for upper gastrointestinal cancer (Table 2). The diagnostic value of serum CEACAM1 was also analyzed by nonparametric ROC curve. Because the serum levels of CEACAM1 in benign disease patients were also increased, it is not surprising that the diagnostic value of CEACAM1 in distinguishing cancer patients from healthy controls was better than that in distinguishing benign disease patients from healthy controls according to the AUC values which were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71\u20130.89; P < 0.001) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60\u20130.78; P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 2A,B). The AUC value for serum CEACAM1 to distinguish lower gastrointestinal cancer patients from healthy controls reached 0.85 (95% CI: 0.75\u20130.96; P < 0.001) which was higher than that (0.74; 95% CI: 0.61\u20130.87; P < 0.001) observed for the upper gastrointestinal cancer group (Fig. 2C,D). Based on the cut-off value calculated according to the Youden index, other indicators of diagnostic accuracy are summarized in Fig. 2E. The use of serum CEACAM1 to distinguish lower gastrointestinal cancer patients from healthy controls and other groups has the highest indicator value, including AUC, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio.

[35] and Wang et al. [34]. Figure 4 shows the representative RT-PCR data. The forward primer is located in exon 6, and the reverse primer is located within the 3\u2032 untranslated region. Thus, the primers could amplify a 408 bp fragment (CEACAM1-L) or a 355 bp fragment (CEACAM1-S) simultaneously based on the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7. As shown in Table 3, the CEACAM1-L/CEACAM1-S (L:S) ratios were significantly higher in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). The radical down-regulation of CEACAM1-S in malignant tissues was mainly responsible for this result, with the expression of CEACAM1-L basically unchanged (Table 3). These findings demonstrate that the CEACAM1-L/S isoform ratios are up-regulated during tumorigenesis and raise the possibility that the role of CEACAM1 in gastrointestinal cancer may depend on which isoform is dominant.\n",

By ELISA analysis, we demonstrated that the serum protein level of CEACAM1 was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer (Fig. 1), which was in accordance with previous observations of CEACAM1 expression in breast cancer [32], lung cancer [31], and prostate cancer [3]. In addition, the AUC for CEACAM1 in ROC analysis remarkably exceeded 0.5 (Fig. 2) in gastrointestinal cancer compared either to healthy controls or to mixed participants (benign disease and healthy groups), with the latter situation more accurately representing clinical practice. Moreover, the CEACAM1 expression in early stage disease was much higher than that in the advanced stages (Table 1), suggesting that CEACAM1 levels increase at an early stage and thus may serve as screening indictor for cancer. However, it should be noted that because easy-to-diagnose patients were enrolled, as in most phase I studies, our results may overestimate the accuracy of this marker [30]. Additionally, we designed our sample size according to our goal of determining whether serum CEACAM1 has any ability to discriminate cancer from non-cancer patients. As a result, future larger prospective studies are needed to validate the prognostic value of serum CEACAM1.",

Our immunohistochemical results (Fig. 3B,D) showed that CEACAM1 is in secreted form within cancer tissues, which is consistent with previous reports [8,9,11]. Furthermore, CEACAM1 showed higher intensity at the invasion front of cancer tissues (Fig. 3D), which is in accordance with the previous study [12].

            "text": "Huang YH and colleagues [38] found that by forming a heterodimeric interaction in \u2018cis\u2019 or \u2018trans\u2019, CEACAM1 serves as a heterophilic ligand for TIM-3. Indeed, co-blockade of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 leads to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses in mouse colorectal cancer models. Because circulating CEACAM1 was reported to act as a blocking antibody to modulate or block the signal transmitted through membrane-anchored CEACAM1 [39], it is reasonable to speculate that the interaction between CEACAM1 and immune cells may explain how circulating CEACAM1 is involved in cancer progression. We suspect that similar mechanisms are involved in gastrointestinal carcinoma. The L:S ratio of CEACAM1 in cancer was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues, and decreased expression of CEACAM1-S was mainly responsible for this phenomenon (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Previous studies have also demonstrated that the CEACAM1-S isoform may possess co-stimulatory functions, through either homophilic and heterophilic interactions, or changes between dimeric and monomeric states [40,41]. Therefore, these isoforms are capable of modifying the inhibitory signals provided by CEACAM1-L when expressed together [28,38,42\u201344]. The equilibrium of the CEACAM1-L/CEACAM1-S (L:S) ratio in our study undoubtedly affected cellular responses to CEACAM1 downstream signaling molecules such as SHP1 binding and SRC-family kinases. Together, our results indicate that an up-regulated CEACAM1-L/CEACAM1-S (L:S) ratio is associated with tumorigenesis in gastrointestinal cancer.",

Moreover, CEACAM1-S mRNA levels were decreased in cancer tissues, while the levels of CEACAM1-L remained generally unchanged, suggesting that the general CEACAM1 expression level is linked to oncogenesis. Moreover, our immunohistochemistry results showed that CEACAM1 was altered in location and expressed along with tumor development and progression, indicating the involvement of CEACAM1 in tumor invasion and metastasis. This result is consistent with previous reports [8,10\u201312]. Although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated in more detail, our investigations provide further evidence for the complexity of the role played by CEACAM1 in cancer.",
