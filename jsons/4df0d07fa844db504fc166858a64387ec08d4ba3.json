Small droplets are likely to evaporate into droplet nuclei (diameter < 10 \u03bcm) in favorable environment, then become potential for long-distance aerosol transmission. 42 Generation of saliva droplets by a person Saliva droplets are generated when breathing, talking, coughing, or sneezing and formed as particles in a mixture of moisture and droplet nuclei of microorganisms. 43 The amount, distance, and size of saliva droplets varies among people, suggesting the infectious strength and transmission path of saliva droplets differ when same pathogen was contracted. 44 Three thousand saliva droplet nuclei could be generated by one cough, which nearly equals to the amount produced during a 5-min talk. 43 Around 40,000 saliva droplets reaching several meters in air can be generated by one sneeze. 43, 45 One normal exhalation can generate saliva droplets reaching the distance of 1 m in air. 43 Large saliva droplets with more mass tends to fall ballistically to the ground and small saliva droplets travel like a cloud over longer distance by air flow. 39, 43, 45 Environment-dependent saliva aerosols transmission Aerosols are suspension of particles in air, liquid, or solid, within size from 0.001 to above 100 \u03bcm. 39 Infectious aerosols contain pathogens. 39 Long-distance aerosol transmission is determined by sufficiently small infectious droplets, being almost indefinitely airborne and transmitted at a long distance (distance between individuals more than 1 m). 39 Aerosol transmission is well accepted in infection of tuberculosis, measles, and chickenpox, and other infectious agents may behave as airborne transmission in a favorable environment or opportunistically, such as SARS-CoV, influenza virus, and adenovirus. 40, 46 Opportunistically airborne transmission is a mode that infectious agents not only have transmission routines by contacting and droplets but also can reach distant susceptible hosts under restricted conditions by fineparticle aerosols in favorable environments. 40 It is possible when aerosol-generating procedure is implemented, such as dental practice, that 2019-nCoV could possibly spread in airborne transmission. 38, 47 Whether saliva droplets can become truly long-distance aerosol transmission is determined by how long the saliva droplets can reside in the air (physical decay), how long the pathogen in saliva droplets remain infectious (biological decay), and whether theses infectious saliva droplets can be acquired by another person (acquisition). 40 In terms of physical decay, saliva droplets evaporate fast into reduced mass in dry air, tending to stay longer along with air flow. 39 The composition of droplet nuclei determines its terminal size. 39 For droplets with slow biological decay, temperature differences and opened door set up droplets exchange along with air flow. 48 Biological decay is determined by dehydration, exposure to ultraviolet and chemicals. 39 Only hardy organism such as M. tuberculosis can survive long in air to form long-distance transmission. 49 A recent review summarized that coronavirus stay vital on surfaces of metal, glass, or plastic for up to 9 days, but no solid evidence has been found how long in air. 50 The coronavirus on inanimate surfaces could be efficiently inactivated by 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 62-71% ethanol, or 0.5% hydrogen peroxide within 1 min as summarized in the literature. 50 So far, no solid evidence to consistently support that 2019-nCoV in saliva droplets can keep vital along air flow for very long time. Liu et al. collected 35 aerosol samples from three areas in two hospitals of Wuhan, and tested 2019-nCoV RNA by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. 51 They found that patient area had low or even undetectable aerosol 2019-nCoV RNA, but deposition aerosol were tested positive, suggesting that not much vital virus in air flow but tend to deposit to the floor, which is similar to movements of large saliva droplets as noted previously. 51 In medical staff area, airborne 2019-nCoV RNA concentration was decreased after patients reduced and sanitization rigorously implemented. 51 In public area, accumulation of crowds increased airborne 2019-nCoV RNA concentration from undateable level. 51 Acquisition of infectious saliva aerosols For acquisition of infectious saliva droplets by a susceptible host, infectious saliva droplets could land in month, eyes, or be inhaled into lungs directly. 26 ,52 A case report shows that 2019-nCoV infection occurred in a fever clinic when a susceptible person wore an N95 mask covering mouth and nose without eyes protected, suggesting a transmission to eyes. 53 It is also reported that SARS-CoV is predominantly transmitted by contacting eye, mouth, or nose. 54 Respiratory virus could lead to respiratory infections of another person through inducing ocular complications. 55 Exposed mucous membranes increased risk of virus transmission by a SARS-CoV study, and close exposure to an infected person increases the chance of infection. 55 A previous study confirmed that infection of SARS-CoV was reduced to a certain degree by wearing surgical masks of susceptible healthcare workers. 56 COMPARISON OF SALIVA 2019-NCOV AND SARS-COV 2019-nCoV, which is also named as SARS-CoV-2, 57 shares about 79% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV. 5,17,58-61 SARS-CoV have a higher mortality rate, while 2019-nCoV spreads much faster. 12 The similarities and differences of saliva are summarized as follows in terms of diagnosis value of

[64] [65] [66] [67] The high viral load of 2019-nCoV suggests it can be transmitted even if symptom is mild or less obvious. Older age was associated with higher SARS-CoV in saliva, and a high initial SARS-CoV load was associated with death. 68, 69 2019-nCoV RNA could be detected in saliva for 20 days or even longer, and the prolonged detection of viral RNA also exist in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. [64] [65] [66] [67] Despite 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV share ACE2 receptor on host cells, which are found in salivary gland and tongue tissues, [23] [24] [25] 29, 53 2019-nCoV is likely more infectious than SARS-CoV possibly due to lower RBD-ACE2 binding free energy and more flexible RBD of 2019-nCoV than that of SARS-CoV. 70 Compared with SARS-CoV, a furin-like cleavage site is peculiar in the S protein of 2019-nCoV, which could theoretically be cleaved by furin expressed in tongue tissues. 33, 34 For saliva droplets as transmission routine in coronavirus infection, a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV transmission reported that students who were in the same cubicle with the SARS patient contracted SARS-CoV, telling us that proximity to SARS patients increases chances of SARS-CoV infection. 52 Virusladen droplets were found in a study as a routine of transmission in SARS epidemics. 71, 72 van Doremalen et al. evaluated the stability of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV in aerosils using a Bayesian regression model, and found that 2019-nCoV remained viable ins aerosols throughout 3-h experiment duration, which is similar to SARS-CoV. 73 SARS-CoV dissemination belongs to opportunistically airborne transmission. 40, 74 2019-nCoV also possibly belong to the same transmission type, dissemination of virus occurs if individuals are exposed to a high concentration of infectious aerosols in comparatively sealed space for long time. 75 PROSPECTIVE It seems that the diagnostic value of saliva depends on how saliva specimens are collected. Saliva from deep throat (91.67 and 86.96% corresponding to two studies), from oral cavity (50%), or from salivary glands (12.90%) indicates a diagnostic tendency of decreased positive rate of 2019-nCoV RNA among COVID-19 patients. [11] [12] [13] [14] For clinical application in need of high positive rate of virus detection, saliva from deep throat has the highest positive rate, which may stand for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Saliva directly from saliva glands ducts is associated with severe COVID-19 and possibly could be a predictive and noninvasive test for severed patients. Whether 2019-nCoV RNA in saliva equals to infectious saliva or a condition of shedding vital virus is still lacking evidence. Even if diagnosis by saliva is noninvasive and less hazardous compared with throat swabs, comprehensive diagnosis should be supported by complete information of symptoms, epidemiological history, and analysis of multiple clinical examinations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 228, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 431, "end": 434, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 435, "end": 437, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 597, "end": 601, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 824, "end": 827, "text": "68,", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 828, "end": 830, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 994, "end": 998, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1003, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1008, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1133, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1138, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1143, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1147, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1150, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1312, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1485, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1488, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1794, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1888, "text": "71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1891, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2132, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2211, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2214, "text": "74", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2426, "end": 2428, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2768, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2769, "end": 2773, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2778, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2779, "end": 2783, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "POSSIBLE DIRECT INVASIONS INTO ORAL TISSUES"}, {"text": "Besides lungs, oral tissue is possible to be directly invaded theoretically due to expression of ACE2 receptor and furin enzyme. 14, 29, 30, 37 About half of the victims reported symptoms of dry mouth and amblygeustia. 14 These symptoms probably came from dysfunction of tongue expressing ACE2 and furin, and salivary gland expression ACE2.
