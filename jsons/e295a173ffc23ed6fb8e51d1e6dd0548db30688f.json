Where human rights were long neglected in international health debates, early government reactions to the HIV/AIDS pandemic catalysed human rights as a basis for public health, as advocates looked explicitly to human rights as being 'inextricably linked' to public health efforts. Amidst the heightened fear and emerging advocacy that structured the early years of the AIDS response, policymakers sought to implement human rights law in public health policy-viewing discrimination as counterproductive to public health goals, abandoning coercive tools of public health practice, and applying human rights to focus on the individual risk behaviours leading to HIV transmission. Moving towards a focus on collective rights, viewing public health itself as a human right, these human rights claims have sought to address underlying population-level determinants of health in a rapidly globalising world.",

By recognising an inextricable linkage between public health and human rights, the health and human rights movement could move away from its early focus on the conflicts between public health practice and individual human rights, employing human rights promotion to advance public health goals. However, infectious disease control efforts continue to challenge the notion that individual rights are always the best approach to support population health, with recent responses to Ebola and COVID-19 continuing to rely on national policies that unnecessarily limit individual rights to protect public health. The human rights infringements resulting from these violative national policies highlight the continuing need for rights-based global health governance in preventing, detecting and responding to infectious disease.",

International law has long been seen as essential to the international cooperation necessary to address the global threat of infectious disease, but human rights were never addressed under global health law until the 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations. This 2005 revision explicitly looked to human rights for the first time-as a basis to respect human dignity and bodily integrity across states in the national implementation of infectious disease control measures. Despite this recent promise of universal human rights in global health governance, the 2014 development of the Global Health Security Agenda reverts to the 'securitisation' of public health to frame national efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease. As nations again resort to unnecessary human rights infringements, abandoning global solidarity and international law in their emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains unclear how human rights law will be implemented through global health governance to support the future of infectious disease control.",

Instrumental to human dignity, human rights address basic needs and frame individual entitlements, conceptualising international imperatives to uphold a universal vision of global justice. 1 By addressing threats to dignity as 'rights violations,' international law offers global standards by which to frame government responsibilities and evaluate policies and outcomes under law, shifting the policy debate from political aspiration to legal obligation. 2 Empowering individuals to seek accountability for these government obligations rather than serving as passive recipients of government benevolence, human rights law identifies individual rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations. 3 The state becomes the principal duty-bearer of human rights upon ratification of the underlying international human rights treaty, with the government thereafter accepting resource-dependent obligations to 'progressively realise' a human right 'to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realisation of the rights'. 4 Building upon state obligations to realise the public's health, human rights can be seen both to protect individual rights from infringement in the pursuit of infectious disease control and to promote collective rights to underlying determinants of health. basic, '[p] ublic health is what we, as a society, do collectively to assure the conditions for people to be healthy'. 6 States have long recognised a responsibility to protect their peoples from infectious disease threats, 7 developing varied approaches of what must be done at a population level to assure 'underlying determinants of health'. 8 Whereas medicine focuses primarily on individual curative treatments in clinical settings, public health actions protect and promote 9 the health of entire societies by using multi-disciplinary interventions and multi-sectoral approaches to address the economic, political, and social determinants that underlie the public's health. 10 Under this expansive view, public health responds to the fundamental underlying structures affecting health, involving, inter alia, disease outbreaks, demographic patterns, economic distributions, and deleterious behaviours. In meeting these collective challenges, public health approaches are often designed to achieve 'the greatest good for the greatest number', applying a utilitarian lens as a basis to control the spread of infectious disease. 11",

In this conflict between collective benefit and individual restrictions, policymakers have long grappled with the appropriate balance between individual rights protection and public health promotion. In the development of human rights law, World War II showed the world the horrors that could occur under the guise of public health, and human rights would be codified under the post-war United Nations (UN) as a means to prevent public health authorities from infringing individual human rights. Out of this UN development of human rights law to protect individuals from public health practices, scholars and practitioners in the 1980s came to recognise the 'inextricable linkages' between public health and human rights, examining the ways in which the public health lens and human rights paradigm can complement each other in preventing disease and promoting health.",

In articulating health-related human rights, the so-called 'Doctors Trial' of Nazi health practitioners by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg formed a key foundation for early post-war human rights developments. 13 The atrocities committed by Nazi physicians during World War II, enabled by the German public health establishment, reflected a complete disregard for the value of human life and the inherent dignity of research subjects. 14 Beginning in 1933, the German Reich advanced public health theories of eugenics as the basis for promulgating the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring, which outlined processes for the voluntary and mandatory sterilization of myriad 'hereditary defects'. 15 Pursuant to these so-called 'racial hygiene' programmes, German public health physicians sterilized between 300,000 and 400,000 German citizens prior to the war. 16 At the onset of war, the Nazi medical establishment moved from the sterilization to the killing those deemed to be 'incurably ill '. 17 During the war, with eugenics holding widespread acceptance in the state medical establishment, German physicians voluntarily aided in theorizing, planning, and operating Nazi killing programmes, which had then expanded from patients of German state hospitals to inmates of Nazi concentration camps. 18 Founded upon debased notions of public health, physicians exterminated millions to prevent the spread of purported diseases and defects. 19 Rather than questioning the ethical propriety of their actions, Nazi physicians enthusiastically performed acts of genocide, acting under a strong, albeit perverse, belief that they were working in accordance with the sound medical principle of 'healing the state'. 20 The genocidal horrors and human experimentation of the Holocaust would not have been possible without the professional legitimation and direct participation of the public health establishment.",

Infectious disease control efforts represent a global public good, and public goods cannot easily be realised through the individualistic lens of human rights. Reframing the realization of the individual right to health, a collective right to public health has become necessary to give meaning to the health-related human rights of populations, addressing population-level public health interests in infectious disease prevention, detection, and response.",

Although the tension between individual human rights obligations and governmental public health responsibilities dominated early health and human rights discourses, 38 an emphasis on this conflict undermines health-related human rights. Whereas many scholars continue to focus on individual negative rights-i.e., those that restrain government action from infringing upon individual liberties-a positive human rights framework acknowledges that governments must act affirmatively to fulfil the economic and social aspects of human rights. 39 Fulfilling these positive components of health-related human rights requires both an individual right to health and collective rights to public health. 40 Normative concern for underlying determinants of public health has become a cornerstone of infectious disease control, laying a foundation for the modern health and human rights movement. This movement draws from social medicine-arising out of the industrial revolution in Prussia and France and revitalized during World War II in Great Britain-with social medicine long viewing public health as an interdisciplinary social science that can examine how socioeconomic inequalities shape the health of populations. 41 Finding that illnesses have multiple population-level causes, social medicine scholars have looked to multisectoral social and political reforms (i.e., underlying determinants of health) rather than medicine as a means of promoting health for the most vulnerable. 42 In the context of international relations, social medicine defined public health as an inherent matter of government concern, separate and apart from the historical role of international health law in the international projection of economic power and national protection of security interests. Incorporated into international law, such a normative focus on underlying determinants of health was elevated in the aftermath of World War II through the holistic goal proclaimed 38 Childress and Bernheim (2003) , King (1999) , Gostin and Lazzarini (1997) . 39 Marks (2001) . 40 Meier and Mori (2005) . 41 Rosen (1974) . 42 Ryle (1948) , Sand (1934) . by states in the WHO Constitution: 'health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity '. 43 Under this rights-based vision of social medicine to address underlying determinants of health, collective rights operate in ways similar to individual rights; however, rather than seeking to empower the individual, collective rights act at a population level to assure public benefits that cannot be fulfilled through individual rights mechanisms. 44 While Western scholars long presupposed an opposition between individual and collective human rights, 45 this distinction is inappropriate to infectious disease control in a globalizing world, where the goals of an individual right to health and a collective right to public health complement each other. 46 Combating the health disparities of a globalized world requires renewed human rights focus-in national policy and global governance-on these collective population-level concerns that underlie the spread of disease.",

However, those in the sanatoriums enjoyed access to higher food rations, specialized care for HIV, and relief from employment responsibilities, benefits that were seen as especially advantageous during Cuba's post-Cold War economic crisis, known as the 'special period'. 53 While the government has stepped away from these rights-infringing practices-employing the sanatoriums now as training centres for HIV diagnosis, education, and care management-Cuba continues to have one of the lowest rates of HIV/AIDS in the region, a public health outcome attributed their early rights-restricting HIV containment practices. 54 The 2014-16 Ebola Virus Disease epidemic similarly highlighted how well-intentioned public health efforts can infringe individual rights. In Liberia, residents of the West Point neighbourhood were quarantined despite a lack of evidence that the virus was more prevalent there than elsewhere in the country. In the United States, a nurse who tested negative for Ebola was nevertheless confined to isolation, although a court would later overturn this derogation of her rights and restriction on her movement. 55 Setting a precedent for current lockdowns during the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic, these examples highlight the need for scientific evidence in public health decision making, even in the course of ongoing infectious disease outbreaks; where there is little scientific information related to new and emerging pathogens, research is warranted to understand the threats such pathogens pose to the public's health and the responses that are necessary to prevent disease.

Establishing a precedent for state vaccine mandates that stands to this day, the U.S. Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts 56 held that the state could enforce compulsory vaccination laws where individual autonomy was deemed subordinate to protecting the health of the population. 57 Recently, however, there has been an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases in high-income countries. Despite being officially eliminated from the United States in 2000, Measles outbreaks have been reoccurring sporadically throughout the country. 58 The resurgence of vaccinepreventable diseases in such settings has largely been attributed to vaccine opponents, who refuse vaccinations based upon religious or personal beliefs. 59 Notwithstanding the proven efficacy of vaccines, the result of this opposition has been to increase 53 Reed (2011) . 54 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 'Global Report: UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic' (UNAIDS 2013). 55 Price (2015) . 56 Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) 197 US 11. 57 Mariner et al. (2005) . 58 McCarthy (2015). 59 Yang et al. (2015) . non-medical vaccine exemptions and, consequently, led to a higher incidence of vaccine-preventable disease in ways that threaten the public's health. 60 Vaccine refusal highlights issues of individual responsibility. In the case of vaccine opposition (particularly for childhood vaccinations), parents must balance their perceived risk of vaccines against the potential negative outcomes of infection. 61 For many years, this debate was assuaged by broad acceptance of childhood vaccinations (bolstered by vaccine mandates for school enrollment), which led to substantial decreases in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases and the establishment of 'herd immunity' at the population level without the need for vaccine mandates. 62 In this way, childhood vaccination programmes have become a victim of their own success. The anti-vaccine movement-fuelled in recent years by false concerns about vaccine safety, coupled with religious and philosophical exemptions to school-based vaccine requirements-has provided an opening for the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases in places where they were previously rare. 63 As exemptions to school vaccine mandates have increased, there has been a waning of herd immunity (also known as 'community protection') against vaccine-preventable disease. Community protection relies on such population immunity. It is this herd immunity, not individual disease immunity, that protects a given population. Therefore, those choosing not to vaccinate remain individually vulnerable to infections, which can then be transmitted throughout the community. On the global scale, while vaccines are most frequently viewed as crucial to public health, erroneous perceptions about vaccine safety continue to undermine the potential of vaccines to prevent infectious disease. 64 This threat from individual refusal to adhere to public health guidelines is similarly seen among those flouting social distancing recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, public health professionals must reexamine not only individual autonomy, but also individual responsibility towards the community-a concept which varies widely across cultural contexts.",

Under this model for balancing individual rights and public health, receiving a vaccine exemption would be possible, but perhaps more difficult, in an effort to push individuals towards vaccination.

Furthering this discrimination through public health policy, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's '4H club' identified homosexuals, heroin users, haemophiliacs and Haitians as specific at-risk groups. This well-intentioned and catchy phrase led to devastating results, with vulnerable groups experiencing housing and employment discrimination, and the impoverished island of Haiti experiencing an 80% decrease in tourism. 67 Such stigma towards risk groups, rather than behaviours, is currently unfolding in the COVID-19 response, where individuals of Asian descent have been stigmatised by the label of the 'Chinese virus', facing discrimination, violence, and health care denial based upon racist demagoguery from nationalist politicians.",

This discrimination, embodied by the longstanding US travel ban against HIV-positive individuals, was finally lifted only in 2010. 68 Rather than discussing risk groups or identity groups, policymakers now talk about risk behaviours underlying infection and key groups.",

Such participation is necessary, in large part, because states are both duty-bearers and the most frequent violators of human rights. 72 This engagement in government processes is extremely important; in the case of health, participation in political debates may entail opportunities for direct action where community members are affected by health care goods, facilities, and services. 73 As such, participation plays a vitally important role in infectious disease control. In the South African case of the Ministry of Health vs. Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), the South African Constitutional Court found that the state was responsible under the right to health for the provision of antiretroviral drugs to pregnant persons for the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. 74 TAC played a critical participatory role in both bringing the legal case and advocating publicly for the availability of antiretrovirals for all HIV-positive South Africans.

While the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is the primary treaty body responsible for monitoring the right to health, numerous other human rights bodies examine health-related human rights, incorporating participation from civil society actors in their assessments of national human rights implementation efforts. 75 Community members can additionally be health agents locally, acting as health resources, improving governmental capacity for health, and supporting primary health care. 76 However, doctors, nurses, and public health professionals often face dual loyalty when, as in many countries, they work within national health systems. 77 Health professionals employed by such systems are state actors and have professional obligations to their employers, but at the same time, they have ethical obligations to those affected by health systems. While setting health policy, health professionals may also be directly providing health services at the community level.",

PIH successfully promoted the participation of affected communities in the early use of antiretroviral therapy in Haiti, resulting in improved compliance with what were then more rigorous medicine regimens. 84 Their success in this approach, coupled with rights-based advocacy efforts, has resulted in a sea change in thinking about the feasibility of antiretroviral therapy among populations in low-resource settings. The COVID-19 response highlights the continuing importance of participation, where adherence to social distancing, self-isolation, and shelter in place policies are designed to \"flatten the curve\"; yet, without widespread community participation, such critical policies are ineffective, if not meaningless.",

Colonized by three different colonial powers, the countries share a history of military coups, dictatorship, civil war, and strife, which have resulted in the destruction of virtually all health care infrastructures, widespread poverty, and a lack of trust in 81 Godlee et al. (2004) . public institutions. 87 Ebola capitalised upon these institutional weaknesses to create a perfect storm of public health, humanitarian, and human rights crises. The global community belatedly rushed to build Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), as nations are seeking today to build hospitals to take in COVID-19 patients, but could offer little in terms of treatment. As seen in the early COVID-19 response, the shortage of surge capacity for face masks, ventilators, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and other essential medical equipment underscores that the global community has not yet learned the importance of public health preparedness. Key lessons from these public health emergencies relative to availability include the importance of investment in trained health professionals, facilities, and surveillance systems. 88 Accessibility of health care and health care systems is operationalised in four ways. Facilities must be geographically and physically accessible, services must be affordable or economically accessible to users, care should be provided in a nondiscriminatory manner (with vulnerable and marginalised populations prioritised), and both users and health personnel should be able to confidentially seek and receive health information. 89 Where health care facilities and personnel were extremely limited in the West African context at the start of the Ebola epidemic, infected people likely delayed seeking care due to poverty, and, later, ETUs were viewed as 'death centres'. Beyond care, it has been necessary in both the Ebola and COVID-19 response to have access to water, sanitation, and hygiene. Even where physically accessible, access to health information is critical to disease control, as seen where the availability of chlorine water buckets for handwashing was useless in the Ebola response without accompanying messaging about why and how to use them. 90 Examining the acceptability of behaviour change relating to cultural practicesfrom mundane handshakes to sacred burials 91 -these practices were socially important and changing them was crucial to preventing Ebola transmission, as they will be necessary to understand and change the course of transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. The concept of acceptability encompasses the oft-debated human rights notion of cultural relativism, requiring that health goods, facilities, and services are culturally appropriate. 92 In the case of Ebola in West Africa, nuanced approaches to behaviour change were necessary to ensure the prevention of disease, including engagement with religious and community leaders in the development of culturally acceptable alternatives to traditional practices. 93 The concept of acceptability is also closely aligned with traditional discussions of medical ethics. 94 In accordance with such ethical principles, the lack of a cure and limited knowledge about effective Ebola treatment required that those treating cases in well-resourced settings rapidly share information with those in West Africa. 95 Quality requires that health facilities, goods, and services are scientifically and medically appropriate. 96 Assuring such quality pursuant to the right to health requires, inter alia, unexpired drugs and equipment and appropriate training for health personnel. In the case of both Ebola and COVID-19, many early casualties of the disease were care givers, including health personnel. With respect to protecting care givers, the importance of correctly donning and doffing PPE is critical in slowing the spread of disease among those in direct contact with infected individuals. The practice was even successfully adopted by a nursing student who used garbage bags to protect herself from Ebola infection while caring for sick family members; in the absence of equipment in the COVID-19 response, seamstresses everywhere have coalesced to sew needed face masks for medical personnel. 97 This examination of efforts to address Ebola and COVID-19 through the AAAQ lens provides useful insights into missed opportunities for the application of the right to health to infectious disease control policy and future directions for public health responses.",

HIV/AIDS, now in its fourth decade as a global pandemic, continues to disproportionately affect impoverished populations, racial and ethnic minorities, the incarcerated, and sexual minorities. Inadequate attention to vector-borne diseases like Zika have resulted in devastating consequences for marginalized populations, including among poor Afro-Brazilian populations. COVID-19 has already descended the social gradient to become a disease of the poor and marginalised, exposing the continuing weaknesses of national efforts to see individual rights as inextricably linked with public health efforts. Despite the challenges posed by existing and emerging infectious diseases, human rights-based approaches offer a framework for advancing national disease control efforts. However, the continuing limitations of these national policies highlight the need for rights-based global health governance.",

            "text": "Collective international governance for infectious disease control has evolved over the past two centuries. Propelled by the steam of industrialisation, migration from rural to urban areas, and cross-border travel and trade challenged nation-states in the nineteenth century to cooperate in the prevention, detection, and control of infectious diseases. As cholera spread throughout Europe in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, individual states, still unaware of modern principles of epidemiology or microbiology, responded by imposing burdensome restrictions on merchants and travellers, including the quarantine of travellers, the disabling of ships, and the destruction of cargo. Given the constraints of these national restrictions on international commerce, 102 international health law would seek to coordinate national public health responses to protect international economic and security interests against infectious disease threats. In 1851, twelve nations met for the first of fourteen International Sanitary Conferences, seeking to stem the spread of infectious disease across Europe without unduly hindering commerce. 103 While a lack of scientific understanding and international consensus stymied international agreement during early conferences, 104 evolving understanding of infectious disease epidemiology finally led to the development in 1892 of a binding agreement: the International Sanitary Convention (ISC). 105 Driven by national security and economic interests rather than a desire to protect the public's health-as either a public good or a human right 106 -states agreed under the ISC to notify each other urgently of outbreaks of specific diseases within their territories, and that the only goods subject to any restrictions would be clothes, bed linen, and rags. There would be no land quarantine, but travellers with cholera or cholera-like symptoms could be detained in isolation. 107 Over the next thirty years, nations adopted additional conventions under the ISC, and by 1926, international law covered three main diseases: cholera, plague, and yellow fever. 108 When WHO was established in 1948 to facilitate post-war international health cooperation, oversight and management of the ISC was incorporated into the Organisation's mandate. 109 Under the WHO Constitution, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the annual meeting of WHO member states, would have authority to adopt sanitary, quarantine, and other regulations designed to prevent the international spread of diseases. 110 These international regulations would be automatically binding on all WHO member states unless they expressly opt-out within a specified period. 111 In 1951, the WHA renamed the ISC the 'International Sanitary Regulations' and expanded their scope to include smallpox, typhus, and relapsing fever. The WHA removed the latter two diseases in 1969 and renamed these regulations the International Health Regulations (IHR). In 1981, smallpox was also removed following its global eradication, returning the IHR to the initial three diseases that sparked international health diplomacy: cholera, plague, and yellow fever. Yet, as the world faced a continuous stream of emerging and re-emerging diseases, the principal international law for preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease outbreaks was increasingly seen as inadequate.",

China's delays in accurately reporting the SARS outbreak-compounded by prohibitions on local Chinese government officials from disclosing public health outbreaks, deemed state secrets, until announced by the Ministry of Health in Beijing 115 -drew widespread international condemnation, including from the WHO Director-General. 116 Only once the international community was formally aware of the outbreak did Chinese officials begin to impose strict cordons sanitaires and quarantines, swiftly closing universities, villages, and apartment buildings and imposing mass quarantines affecting more than 30,000 people in Beijing alone. 117 China's judiciary thereafter issued an edict that existing laws criminalising the intentional spread of disease applied to SARS, carrying a punishment from 10 years imprisonment to execution. 118 Yet these public health measures were criticised as being applied arbitrarily and in a discriminatory manner 119 and thus inconsistent with the legitimate public health use of quarantines or isolation measures. While these state 112 Pannenborg (1979 measures were consistent with international health law, they risked violating international human rights law, including protections of the right to life, right to health, freedom of movement, and freedom of speech. 120 With SARS highlighting the weaknesses of international law for infectious disease control, the international community would commit not only to update the breadth, scope, and notification obligations under the IHR, but also to address the absence of human rights protections under international health law.",

Adopted under Articles 21 and 22 of the WHO Constitution, the IHR became automatically binding on all WHO member states and entered into force in July 2007. The purpose of the revised IHR is to prevent, protect against, control, and respond to the international spread of infectious disease through public health measures that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. 121 Much like the International Sanitary Conventions of the nineteenth century, merchants and travellers are the primary focus of these provisions, which aim to respond to any Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), including the introduction and spread of a disease from one country into another. Implemented by national governments, state sovereignty continues to be a central tenet of the IHR, reflected in principles that provide states the sovereign responsibility to develop health legislation to address a specific public health risk. However, this domestic legislation 'should uphold the purpose' of the IHR, 122 reinforcing international commitments under both international health law and international human rights law.",

As a cornerstone principle of human rights, any health measure taken by a country in accordance with the IHR must be applied in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner. 124 The IHR do not preclude countries from implementing health measures within their territory in response to a PHEIC; however, such measures must be in accordance with both national and international law. Thus, national measures must achieve at least the same level of health protection as WHO recommendations and must not be more restrictive of international traffic, or more invasive or intrusive to individuals, than reasonably available alternatives. 125 Crucially, the IHR provide that an imminent public health risk does not displace a state's non-derogable obligations under human rights law. These include respecting, protecting, and fulfilling the right to life, freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and freedom from non-consensual medical experimentation. In addition to limits on the domestic health measures that a WHO member state may take, the IHR additionally limit the nature of health measures governments may take with respect to travellers, requiring that states treat travellers with respect for their dignity, human rights, and fundamental freedoms as well as minimise any discomfort or distress arising from the health measures taken. 126 Protecting the rights of travellers in the implementation of health measures, the IHR require that states consider the gender, sociocultural, ethnic, or religious concerns of travellers. 127 Yet states have not always complied with these human rights principles in the implementation of the IHR. During the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea implemented a triangular, regional cordon sanitaire where the three national borders meet. 128 This cross-border area already had a long history of restrictive health responses, having faced prior colonial campaigns of cordoning entire villages affected by infectious diseases. 129 Responding to these Ebola restrictions, the WHO spokesperson stated that while WHO would not be against the use of a cordon sanitaire, 'human rights have to be respected'. 130 The effective implementation of a cordon sanitaire invariably impacts the right to movement, yet during an extraordinary public health event, it may be the least restrictive option based upon scientific evidence and principles. However, if not implemented in accordance with human rights, cordons sanitaires may additionally lead to the deprivation of other health-related human rights, including the right to health, the right to food, the right to water, and the non-derogable right to life. 131 Compounding these rights violations, the Liberian government additionally imposed an expansive quarantine over the West Point area of Monrovia in August 2014, contradicting public health recommendations and forcing at least 75,000 people to remain in overcrowded and 124 Ibid., art. 42. 125 Ibid., art. 43(2) . 126 Ibid., art. 32. 127 Ibid., art. 32(b) . 128 McNeil Jr (2014) . 129 Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future (2016). 130 McNeil Jr (2014). 131 Zidar (2015) . unsanitary conditions. 132 After ten days of restrictions on access to food, water, and other determinants of health-resulting in deadly clashes between residents and the military-the government was forced to remove the quarantine order. 133 Tested by the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, the public health and human rights safeguards contained in the IHR remained insufficient to prevent the use of unnecessary and IHRnon-compliant domestic health measures, setting a precedent that would be vastly expanded amidst the rights violations accompanying cordons sanitaires employed by China in the early COVID-19 response. 134",

Further limiting accountability through WHO, this international monitoring mechanism is not activated if state measures are domestically focused and do not have a significant impact on international travel. Where countries engage in exclusively domestic health measures that may violate human rights, the IHR remain silent, with states bound only by independent international human rights obligations and any normative influence found through the 'temporary recommendations' process during a PHEIC.",

Despite this, nearly 30 countries had imposed travel bans by November 2014, including Australia and Canada, both high-income countries with developed public health systems. 151 To assure greater compliance with future recommendations, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan called in October 2015 for accountability mechanisms under the IHR, including sanctions for countries that restrict international travel and trade. 152 This was echoed in the report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel, tasked with reviewing the IHR and WHO in response to the Ebola epidemic. 153 powers to publicly examine countries' rationales for their health measures may be more effective. 154 Notwithstanding these universal recommendations to curtail unnecessary travel restrictions, nations have largely disregarded these WHO recommendations again in the COVID-19 response, with nationalist governments rapidly enacting emergency travel bans that have divided the world and threatened global governance while providing only marginal health benefits. 155 The implementation of the IHR is intended to be carried out with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the laws, structures, and procedures that countries employ to meet their IHR obligations must be compatible with international human rights obligations. By extension, satisfactory implementation of the IHR domestically should ensure that human rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled-not only for travellers but for all residents. Where the Ebola epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the practical limitations of the IHR temporary recommendations, there remain accountability challenges in assuring rights-based approaches to PHEICs.",

While states are required to report to WHO on their progress in achieving a set of core capacities deemed necessary for fulfilment of their IHR obligations to detect, report, and respond to public health threats, 156 only 22% of countries reported by their 2012 deadline that they had met these capacity requirements. 157 In an effort to independently assess state progress in implementing the IHR, WHO in 2016 formally adopted a joint external evaluation (JEE) tool that established an independent expert review process to assess national progress against IHR core capacities, find gaps in implementation, and identify best practices. 158 Given the slow and inconsistent implementation of the IHR, states additionally looked to develop new institutions of global governance to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies. A partnership of forty countries and international organisations came together in February 2014 to launch the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to assist countries to develop and meet their IHR capacities for 'a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats'. The GHSA is centred around three pillars of infectious disease: prevention (to preemptively protect against threats), detection (to determine when a threat arises) and 154 Moon et al. (2015) . 155 Meier et al. (2020) . 156 response (to address threats as they are occurring). 159 Under these pillars are eleven 'action packages', or areas of specific focus, to give effect to these pillars of prevention, detection, and response. The action packages-including, inter alia, preventing zoonotic diseases, ensuring biosafety and biosecurity, establishing real-time surveillance and developing medical countermeasures-set out targets, measurements, and specific action items for states to realise infectious disease control. National governments under the GHSA are urged to build their capacities to support these action packages, including through specific legislative and policy reforms. 160 Despite the centrality of human rights to the revision of the IHR, and the opportunity to use the IHR implementation process to incorporate human rights protections into public health policies, the GHSA shifts away from an explicit consideration of human rights. The right to health is implicitly realised through the work of the GHSA, improving infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response capacities; however, the GHSA does not incorporate the lessons that led to the inclusion of human rights language in the revision of the IHR, such as the role of civil society, scientists, and the media as surveillance sources. 161 The realisation of human rights is not expressly included at all in the text of the GHSA action packages. While the action packages require participating countries to implement policy reforms, there is no requirement that countries ensure that such reforms are consistent with human rights obligations under international health law or international human rights law. Many of the action packages will influence health-related human rights-on issues of surveillance and privacy rights, bodily integrity and freedom of movement, and interventions that may raise procedural rights issues-yet the GHSA includes no safeguards that such activities are conducted in ways that respect, protect, or fulfill human rights.",

            "text": "Given the absence of explicit human rights language and obligations, the GHSA risks neglecting-or even undermining-the public health benefits of a rights-based approach to infectious disease prevent, detection, and response. Rather than the traditional public health paradigm, the GHSA is framed through a 'securitisation' approach to disease, which views threats to public health as existential threats to national and international security, 'requiring emergency measures and justifying actions outside the normal bounds of political procedure'. 162 Conceptually, the process of securitising socio-economic issues is not inherently in conflict with human rights. For example, the concept of 'human security' arose from human rights-based approaches to development. 163 WHO has described global health security as addressing 'vulnerabilities to acute public health events', 164 and this description is consistent with how international human rights law frames the right to health. However, global health security is rarely presented in current policy discourse through the lens of human rights. 165 As seen in the modern history of infectious disease control-from HIV to Ebola to COVID-19-governments have used public health emergencies to rationalise limitations on, or in some cases derogations from, their obligations under international human rights law. Framing certain infectious diseases as risks to security can normalise what would otherwise be extraordinary measures, undermining the justifications behind necessary limitations of human rights under international law. Further, if an infectious disease arises that is deemed a threat to national or international security, there is a risk that primary decision-making authority can shift from public health decision-makers to national security institutions. 166 For example, during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the UN Security Council stepped into the realm of global health through the adoption of Resolution 2177, which determined that the 'unprecedented extent of the Ebola outbreak in Africa constitutes a threat to international peace and security'. 167 This resolution highlighted the potential for 'forum shopping' global health threats-from health governance to security governance-leading to security-based policies that may conflict with health and human rights goals, as seen in autocratic emergency responses to COVID-19 that have drawn the scrutiny of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, public health professional societies, and human rights non-governmental organizations. 168 Rather than supporting infectious disease control efforts, such conflicts can undermine effective collaboration between domestic public health and national security authorities responsible for the infectious disease response. 169 The GHSA has demonstrated that the reframing of global public health as an international security issue has the power to mobilize high-income countries to invest financial and technical resources into capacity building for infectious disease prevention, detection, and response in low-income countries. Through the JEE process, more than sixty countries have undergone external evaluations of their IHR core capacity compliance to highlight gaps in capacities and set priorities for full IHR implementation. 170 However, such a securitization approach funded by high-income countries inherently prioritises threats to high-income countries. 171 Neglected diseases or diseases that do not pose a security threat to wealthy nations are unlikely to trigger the financing and capacity building necessary for infectious disease governance, forcing low-income countries to rely solely on traditionally underfunded humanitarian approaches to some pressing infectious disease threats. The securitization approach imparts obligations on low-income countries that prioritises surveillance of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases, which may not reflect the immediate public health priorities of that country. 172 Despite this, the strengthening of public health systems for emerging or re-emerging diseases is hoped to have flow-on effects that benefit infectious diseases that do not fit within the securitisation paradigm. This was demonstrated in the reverse (i.e., humanitarian investment advancing health security) in Nigeria during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, when polio surveillance and response systems were able to transform quickly to detect cases and conduct subsequent contact tracing, and now as Ebola surveillance and response systems are being repurposed for COVID-19 control. 173 With the GHSA distorting political priority-setting in infectious disease governance, the securitisation of infectious disease further risks undermining rights-based approaches to health where emergency measures test the permissible limitations on human rights to protect public health. Through a securitisation lens, what would otherwise be an unauthorised limitation of a right may be legitimised in circumstances where the legitimacy derives from emergency authorities. This risks removing infectious disease control from 'routine democratic considerations' 174 in ministries of health or departments of public health to less transparent parts of government under police or military authorities. This securitisation of public health has been pervasive in the COVID-19 response. Inherent in the securitisation of public health is the risk that national security concerns drive a country's response to an infectious disease in ways that harm both human rights and public health. It is imperative that any risk that an infectious disease poses to the economic or political integrity of the nation does not override parallel risks to human rights. This balance between infectious disease control and human rights realisation in the context of a pandemic was carefully examined in the drafting of the IHR; however, countries that have not implemented human rights frameworks under law-whether constitutional, legislative, or regulatory-risk implementing infectious disease prevention, detection, and response without these important rights-based safeguards.",

While implementation of the IHR's traditional public health core competencies has been the focus of programmes to accelerate domestic implementation, greater attention must be paid to ensuring the implementation of the IHR's human rights provisions. To re-centre and reiterate human rights protections within global health law, it will be necessary to continue to recognise the inextricable linkages between human rights and public health. As seen in the limited influence of rights-violating efforts to contain and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains clear that the lack of respect for human rights in a global health security response can hobble efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease. 175 Correspondingly, the realisation of human rights principles-including non-discrimination, participation, transparency, and accountability-remain critical for an effective public health response that ensures the highest attainable standard of health.",

Assuring the continuing realisation of human rights-even amidst this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic responseit will be necessary to assess whether infection control policies, programmes, and practices pose the least threat of infringing on human rights while presenting the greatest opportunity to realise health-related human rights. Human rights scholars can provide this human rights impact assessment as a basis to monitor infectious disease control actions in national health policy and global health governance. There must be accountability for human rights in national policy and global governance, codified through the adoption of: interpretive general comments on infectious disease control from human rights treaty bodies; WHO human rights guidance for IHR implementation that is assessed through the IHR Review Process; and revised human rights derogation standards prepared by an independent body of experts, involving civil society, global health lawyers, and other public health experts in the field. Given that such human rights derogation and realisation must be assessed on a caseby-case basis, global governance systems can provide necessary assessments of state actions, recognizing the connections between national policy and global governance and facilitating human rights accountability in preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease through global health law.",
