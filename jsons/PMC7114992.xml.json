There have been three pandemic influenza outbreaks in the 20th history: the Spanish flu (1918\u201319), the Asian flu (1957\u201358), and the Hong Kong flu (1968\u201369) [32]. The 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic (known as the Spanish flu) was the most devastating in recent history, where at least 20 million died [30]. In the United States, about 675,000 lives were lost to the Spanish flu with an estimated mean case fatality rate of 2% [52]. This case fatality rate is an order of magnitude larger than the case fatality rates observed in seasonal flu epidemics in normal years. Recurrent outbreaks of H5N1 around the world and the most recent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 suggest that a deadly pandemic is eminent.",

However, none of these studies have incorporated intentional changes in individual behavior, such as avoiding gatherings, increasing hygiene, or staying home. Furthermore, these studies have assumed that these non-pharmaceutical interventions would remain in effect for the duration of the pandemic. Typically, people resume their normal behaviors due to lack of resources or as the perceived risk declines [27].

The accurate representation of population heterogeneity is one of the greatest challenges of epidemic modeling. While substantial progress has been made over the years with the introduction of different mixing functions [29] and mixing matrices [2] for compartmental models, they are still far from achieving a good approximation to real world scenarios. In recent years, new approaches that incorporate more realistic contact structures have been developed to allow for nonrandom interactions among populations [4, 22, 48, 54]. For example, Zaric [54] compared random and nonrandom mixing patterns for network epidemic models and showed that different mixing assumptions led to different epidemic outcomes. In particular, they found that random mixing generally results in a greater number of new infections than nonrandom mixing. Similarly, Bansal et al. [4] used several real and simulated datasets of human contact networks to analyze their impact on disease spread. They concluded that homogeneous-mixing models are appropriate for host populations that are nearly homogeneous. However, network models are more appropriate to better capture and predict disease spread through heterogeneous host populations. Furthermore, Fuk\u015b et al. [22] used an agent-based model of Southern and Central Ontario to investigate the spatial correlations of disease spread. They concluded that spatial correlations were difficult to destroy if neighborhood sizes were inhomogeneous. Finally, Stroud et al. [48] showed a strong correlation between local demographic characteristics and pandemic severity. This study used an agent-based model of Southern California with a heterogeneously mixing population and concluded that the average household size in a census tract was strongly correlated with the clinical attack rate.",

The disease model assumes that 50% of adults and seniors, 75% of students, and 80% of preschoolers will stay home within 12 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms. These people can then transmit disease only to household members or visitors. Based on previous studies [34], 33.3% of infections are assumed to be subclinical. Individuals in the subclinical stage are only half as infectious as those in the symptomatic stages and continue their normal activities as if they were not infected.

The news of increasing numbers of people becoming ill, or seeing friends and family fall ill, is strong motivation to avoid potential infectious situations. Surprisingly, none of the recent studies on pandemic influenza have incorporated the impact of this type of behavioral change. We assume that people isolate due to fear at a level that follows the pattern of the epidemic [6, 27]. This is implemented with a specification of start, peak, and end times with corresponding fractions of the population that will be isolating at those times, along with a minimum and maximum contiguous duration per individual. We assume that people who choose to stay home will only self-isolate for 7\u201314 days at a time. People isolate on an individual basis, not on a household basis, so there might be households in which some members of the family are isolating due to fear and others are going about their normal activities. Fear-based home isolation begins when a percentage of the population is symptomatic (e.g., 0.1%). The number of people self-isolating increases linearly until reaching a maximum near the epidemic peak day. After this day, the stay-home rate begins to drop linearly with time, until no fear-based home isolation is occurring by a selected end day.",

We further assume that two doses of pandemic vaccine are required to attain an immune response of 80% seropositivity after 42 days from the first dose [33]. Those who are vaccinated and become sick are only 20% as infectious as those who become sick without the vaccine. In all of the scenarios where a strain-specific vaccine is considered, the strain-specific vaccine is distributed as soon as it becomes available.

In the 5 month school closure scenario, schools reopen on day 183 when 0.0007% (14,238 people) is infected; in the 8 month scenario, schools reopen on day 273 when 0.00003% (721 people) of the population is infected. However, if schools close for the duration of the pandemic (in this case 11 months), the disease dies out and no second wave is generated. Unlike previous studies that have shown that the benefit provided by school closures is maintained after schools reopen [25], our simulation results show that, given the limited number of vaccine doses, if schools reopen too early a new infection wave appears, resulting in an increased number of new cases. Nevertheless, even in the presence of infection waves, the overall clinical attack rate for these three scenarios of school closures is lower than the baseline. Although school closures prolong the epidemic due to the reduction in the number of contacts, they benefit society by spreading the number of hospitalizations over two waves, which is crucial in order to maintain health-care services operational. Our results show that school closures for the duration of the pandemic (up to 11 months) are the most effective strategy in containing the pandemic and reducing morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the 11 month strategy also reduces the number of vaccinations needed to contain the pandemic.\n\n",

Here, we apply tools from social network epidemiology [35, 39, 43] to study how changes in behavior affect the contact network and, as a result, disease transmission. The social contact network emerges from the simulation as individuals move through their daily activities and come into and out of contact in rooms [11]. We extracted the degree distribution of the social contact structure in the absence of disease during a random day for the baseline, 100% school closure scenario, and at the peak of the 50% fear-based home isolation scenario. Figure 5 depicts the population distribution in Southern California under the three scenarios for a typical day. On average, each individual has 22.5, 19.9, and 8 contacts per day for the baseline, 100% school closure scenario, and 50% fear-based home isolation scenario, respectively. We observe that the average number of contacts per day decreased for the school closure and fear-based home isolation scenarios when compared to the baseline. Note that the average number of people contacted per person can provide an estimate of how many people can potentially acquire infection from one index case. Furthermore, we found that closing schools would be less effective in breaking the social contact network than fear-based home isolation. This finding might be due to the fact that school closures imply partial home isolation; individuals affected by this intervention still perform other scheduled activities, except for school-related activities. While fear-based home isolation assumes that people affected by this intervention are completely cut off from the rest of the population, our results show that reactive changes in population contact rates can have a dramatic impact on the overall contact structure.\n\n",

Antivirals share important features that could make them useful during a pandemic [34], although most countries do not have enough antivirals stockpiled and current distribution strategies may not allow for rapid dissemination of drugs.

However, when the fraction of people self-isolating is over 50% (e.g., the intervention is too strong [26]) a second infection wave appears if home isolation is relaxed, leading to a larger clinical attack rate.

There is a potential for multiple infection waves if public health measures are relaxed before the epidemic is over. Perhaps the most illustrative example of secondary waves is the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic in Toronto, Canada, where a secondary wave of infection occurred following a relaxation of infection-control precautions that were also associated with temporary increases in nosocomial transmission events [41]. The potential role that behavior changes may have played on the multiple wave pandemic profile observed during the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic in many regions of the world should not be discarded [6, 12, 27].",
