However, it will be important to understand and model the long-term impact of significantly reduced physical activity on health for these patients should the present approach need to be maintained for months as indicated by Prime Minister Trudeau on April 8th. 13 These children are already at increased cardiovascular risk and physical inactivity has many other negative health consequences (e.g. bone health, motor skill development, body composition) which warrant consideration when making future public health decisions. 4, 14 The impact of reduced physical activity on population will depend on the duration of measures and the magnitude of reduction, so careful monitoring is required.",

If this is possible, or could be with appropriate intervention, then long-term negative health impacts due to reduced physical activity could be avoided. From January through early March, 2019 and 2020 step-counts are similar and increasing. Later in March, 2020 step-counts are significantly lower than 2019, despite seasonal match between the cohorts. It appears that this reduction is driven by reduced weekday step-counts, likely reflecting COVID-19-related disruptions to parents' and children's routines (work, school, extracurricular activities). Week 14 step-counts, though still lower than 2019, suggest a slight increase in physical activity from the previous week, which may reflect expected spring increase in physical activity and/or adaptive measures taken by families as COVID-19 measures extend. 17 The objective measurement of physical activity in this study provides the basis for future investigation of the long-term impacts of reduced physical activity during COVID-19 and how best to mitigate these. It will provide baseline data to investigate the necessity and effectiveness of supports for physical activity during and after the pandemic. This may provide an opportunity to assist children with CHD and their families in developing life-long physical activity habits that are less reliant on external factors (e.g. school, extracurricular physical activities), which are currently cancelled, but normally contribute to physical activity levels in school-aged children. 18 Physical activity monitoring throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after will permit better understanding of the adaptability of children with CHD and their families, and may help generate and test hypotheses about individual and family based physical activity interventions.",

Future studies will be needed to model these impacts and explore potential strategies for mitigation. Continuous physical activity monitoring data during this pandemic provides unique insight about the impact of COVID-19 and public health precautions on daily habits of children with CHD, which will hopefully inform clinicians about potential health impacts and help develop interventions if necessary, both during the pandemic, and in the future.",

Clinicians, policy makers, and other stakeholders need to consider the potential long-term and indirect health impacts of public health precautions in response to COVID-19. Children with CHD have significantly reduced physical activity compared to prior to the pandemic. The short-and long-term health impacts of this cardiovascular risk behavior change have not yet been elucidated and are in part dependent on the duration of the health measures and any action taken to mitigate the adverse effects of these measures.

There were no significant differences in participant characteristics between the 2019 and 2020 groups; overall data are shown in Table 1.In both 2019 and 2020 there is a slight trend towards increasing step-counts from January through early March (Figure 1). Step-counts in matched weeks are not significantly different between the groups until the last week of March (week 13, p =0.025) and the first week of April (week 14, p=0.010); both are significantly lower in 2020 (Table 1, Figure 1). Weekday mean step-counts differ from 2019 to 2020 (p=0.015 and p=0.001), while weekends do not (p=0.427 and p=0.608). All mean step-counts were below 12,000 (Canadian physical activity guidelines equivalent), in both 2019 and 2020. 9,10 Males had higher step-counts than females; no significant time-sex interactions were observed (Supplementary Figure 1). In 2020, step-counts began to decrease around March 11 th , when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (Figure 2). A significant reduction in step-counts occurred from the week of March 9 th (Week 11, 10329\u00b13958 steps) to the weeks of March 23 rd (Week 13, 6474\u00b13468 steps, p<0.001) and March 30 th (Week 14, 7569\u00b14742 steps, p=0.021). This significant decline occurred the week following BC's declaration of a public health emergency, implementation of 2-meter physical distancing, and suspension of K-12 schools (March 17 th ). It began during Spring Break (March 16 th to 27 th for most BC schools), and persists beyond, into week 14.",
