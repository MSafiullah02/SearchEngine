            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) belongs to the Herpesviridae family and is highly prevalent in the population all over the world [1]. Like other herpesviruses, HCMV establishes latency, and the virus frequently reactivates in immunosuppressed patients such as transplant patients and HIV infected patients. Reinfection with a new genetically distinct HCMV strain that has been observed in transplant recipients, suggest that a previously established HCMV infection in a patient does not protect against re-infection [2]. In immunocompromised hosts, primary or reactivated HCMV infection can result in a variety of clinical manifestations, and sometimes the virus can cause life-threatening HCMV disease. HCMV disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. HCMV GI disease is often suspected in AIDS patients with GI symptoms [3]. During the last four decades, increasing evidence also suggests that HCMV may be prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the exact pathogenic role of HCMV in disease development remains uncertain [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. We have previously provided evidence for a high prevalence of HCMV-DNA and HCMV antigens in intestinal tissue sections obtained from patients with IBD, which suggest a common presence of an active HCMV infection in these patients.",

            "text": "There is a general agreement that autoimmune diseases have a multifactorial etiology that is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors. Among the latter, viruses may play an important role since they can induce autoimmunity through several mechanisms, such as exposure of normally \u201chidden\u201d epitopes, presentation of cross-reactive peptides, through upregulation of key molecules on antigen presenting cells, by molecular mimicry mechanism, and presentation of host cell-derived proteins in the viral envelope [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. HCMV infection has been suggested to be associated with various autoimmune manifestations such as hemolytic anemia, granulocytopenia, the autoimmune like disease chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) in bone marrow transplant patients (BMT) and the production of a variety of autoantibodies. Our group has previously shown that the cellular molecule CD13 becomes associated with HCMV particles during viral particle maturation in infected cells and that the HCMV-associated autoantigen CD13 appears to become immunogenic during HCMV infection [16], [17], [18]. In support of this hypothesis, we have previously found CD13-specific autoantibodies in bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients with an active HCMV infection [17]. These antibodies may bind to cells that are CD13 positive in the patients tissues, such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, granulocytes and macrophages and may exert cytotoxic effects and may also affect important cellular functions.",

All these patients were positive for CMV-IgG except for one patient with UC and 3 patients with CD who were CMV-IgG negative (Table 1). However, in the non-severe group, lower levels of antibodies reactive against CD13 transfected mouse cells could be detected by using FACS. CD13 reactive sera were separated in two categories >50 (high) and <50 (low) in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in FACS analysis for CD13. All these sera were analyzed for cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells, neutrophil granulocytes, CaCo-2 cells and HPAEC (\nFig. 5A\u2013D). In eight sera obtained from UC patients with high MFI, CD13-specific F(ab)\u20322 fragments of monoclonal antibodies in sera obtained from patients with UC blocked cytotoxicity by approximately 78% in THP-1, 50% in CaCo-2 cells, 42% in HPAEC and 6% in neutrophil granulocytes. In nine sera obtained from patients with CD cytotoxicity was blocked by 78% in THP-1 cells, 43% in CaCo-2 cells, 21% in HPAEC and by 3% in neutrophil granulocytes as compared to blocking with monoclonal antibodies against CD33 or CD34 (Fig. 5A\u2013D). Furthermore, in all sera obtained from IBD patients (UC: 20 patients, CD: 17 patients) with a low MFI, CD13-specific monoclonal antibodies blocked cytotoxicity in sera obtained from UC by approximately 58% in THP-1 cells, 35% in CaCo-2 cells, 6% in HPAEC and 20% in neutrophil granulocytes and in sera obtained from patients with CD by 68% in THP-1 cells, 5% in CaCo-2 cells, 31% in neutrophil granulocytes, but not for HPAEC. We observed that CD33 and CD34 antibodies also blocked cytotoxicity in some cell types (CaCo-2 cells, HPAEC) but not to the extent that was observed using CD13-specific antibodies (Fig. 5A\u2013D). However, neither CD13, CD33 nor CD34 monoclonal antibodies blocked cytotoxicity to different cell types examined by using sera obtained from healthy blood donors (Fig. 5A\u2013D).

[9] detected HCMV-DNA in intestinal tissue samples in 81% and 66% of patients with UC and CD, respectively, by using a nested PCR assay. Recently, Hommes et al. [34], by computer search (Medline, from 1966 to 2002; EMBASE, from 1980\u20132002) reported 33 case reports addressing the role of HCMV in IBD patients. The majority of these reports describe patients with severe attacks of UC, who had received corticosteroids for a prolonged time before HCMV was recognized. Toxic dilatation was present in 15% of patients, and colectomies were performed in 62% of patients. Mortality rates as high as 44% were observed in this group of patients, which illustrates the severity of disease in the reported cases. By computer search (Medline and EMBASE; from 2003 to 2006) we have identified 18 new case reports [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52] demonstrating HCMV infection in patients with IBD, indicating an increased observed prevalence of HCMV infection among IBD patients. Several of these investigators have reported a beneficial role of antiviral treatment in IBD patients. However, the possible pathogenic role of HCMV in IBD patients is still unclear and needs further investigation.",

These observations pose the question whether HCMV induced autoimmunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. We have previously identified the CD13 molecule to be present on most cell types that are susceptible to HCMV infection in vitro, and have also provided evidence for CD13 to be a potential cellular receptor for the virus [56]. We have also previously described that this molecule is associated with HCMV particles and that CD13 appears to be immunogenic in bone marrow transplant patients (BMT) during clinical HCMV infection. We found that CD13-specific autoantibodies were identified in BMT patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease, but exclusively in patients who had experienced either HCMV disease or HCMV viremia, and these antibodies appeared at the time of HCMV detection [17].",

[58] reported that a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). They found that the hematological findings in SARS patients may be related to (1) a direct infection of blood cells and bone marrow stromal cells via CD13 or CD66a; and/or (2) an induction of autoantibodies and immune complexes that may result in damage to these cells. Unfortunately, the authors did not investigate occurrence of autoantibodies against CD13. Perhaps coronaviruses and other unknown viruses may be involved in the induction of CD13-specific autoantibodies in certain individuals. Unfortunately, there are no data regarding other viral infections in our patient groups.",

For instance, such antibodies could through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis of opsonized cells by complement mediated cell lysis, or by complement/Fc receptor mediated leukocyte recruitment, lead to enhanced inflammation that results in release of enzymes and reactive oxygen species, leading to increased tissue injury. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of CD13 (aminopeptidase N) may also be of crucial importance for normal cell physiology. Aminopeptidases catalyze the cleavage of amino acids from the amino terminus of protein or peptide substrates. CD13 has been demonstrated to play a role in trimming of antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) [59], [60]. CD13 has also been suggested to modulate the cell cycle. Occupation of the active center of CD13 with artificial ligands such as monoclonal antibodies induces a prolongation of the cell cycle and a decrease in the rate of cell growth [61]. CD13-specific antibodies may also cause non-immunological damage of target cells, e.g. by inducing apoptosis. In addition, the CD13 molecule has been implied to mediate control of cellular differentiation [62]. We have recently found that HCMV particles that interact with the CD13 molecules on monocytes lead to an inhibition of macrophage differentiation [63]. Therefore, binding of CD13-specific antibodies to cells and structures expressing CD13 could perhaps also contribute both to tissue damage and chronic inflammation.",

Such autoantibodies have previously only been observed in HCMV-infected patients. These autoantibodies may have a pathogenic role in the intestine of IBD patients by a specific target attack of CD13 positive tissue structures and may also explain immunological phenomena not involving the bowel, e.g. manifestation in the eye, joint and skin that are observed in these patients. Further identification of the immunogens eliciting specific antibody responses could offer new clues as to the pathogenesis of IBD and may and provide new possibilities for development of specific therapies.",
