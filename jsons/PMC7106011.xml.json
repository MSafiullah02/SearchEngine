Currently, the virus has affected about 1100 individuals in 23 countries across the globe, claiming 439 (40%) lives, and thus poses a public health challenge to the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere (Figure 1\n) [2], [3]. MERS-CoV outbreak began a decade after the epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that caused a global scare in 2002-2003 affecting over 8000 people across the world killing one tenth of them [4], [5], [6]. However, unlike SARS, which disappeared within a year, the MERS-CoV epidemic continues (Table 1\n).",

MERS-CoV gains entry into target cells by binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike glycoprotein to human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), whereas SARS enters the target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [25], [33], [34]. Both ACE2 and hDPP4 are commonly expressed in some human organs such as kidneys [33]. MERS-CoV utilises host proteases to gain entry into lung cells [35]. The spike protein on the viral envelope is activated by a protease, called furin, and mediates membrane fusion which eventually supports the virus entry into a host cell [33], [36], [37]. Consequently, protease inhibitors (e.g., camostat) are found to block MERS-CoV entry into cells [35].",

Dyspnoea is a frequent complaint, and the majority of the patients develop pneumonia (70%) and ultimately require admission into an intensive care unit (ICU). Concomitant infections and hypoalbuminemia were identified as the predictors of severe infection in individuals aged >65 years [53]. Other extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction such as circulatory collapse, abnormal liver functions and hematological derangements are common in critically ill patients [61]. A second-trimester stillbirth has been reported in a pregnant woman with MERS-CoV [62].",

It has been suggested that 2F9, a clone of CD26, and YS110, a humanised monoclonal antibody against CD26, could be a potential therapeutic agent for MERS-CoV [78]. One of the antibodies, m336, neutralises the virus with exceptional potency, and therefore, has potential as a candidate drug and could be even useful in vaccine design [79]. Additionally, human MicroRNAs might be useful as antiviral therapy against MERS-CoV infection [80]. In case of hospitalised patients, the untested convalescent-phase plasma has been suggested as a supportive therapy to minimise the severity of infection [81].",
