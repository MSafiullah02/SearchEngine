Proietti et al [5] have proposed a simplified protocol for triaging patients with urinary stones during the pandemic. The authors recommend a conservative approach in managing cases of renal colic to avoid in-hospital admissions. They also recommend insertion of ureteric stents and nephrostomy tubes under local anaesthetic, if possible, to spare a ventilator. Their protocol includes a telephone consultation to screen patients for history and/or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Any patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring urgent endourological intervention would be managed in a dedicated operating room. The authors suggest a priority assessment for patients scheduled for stone surgical intervention that is based on several parameters: stone size and location; obstructive uropathy; symptom control; presence of an indwelling ureteric stent or nephrostomy tube; and other related factors such as a solitary kidney or impaired renal function. On the basis of their model, surgery for a patient with a unilateral nonobstructing renal stone and normal renal function can be postponed, whereas cases with a solitary kidney or obstructing ureteric stones should be prioritised. Patients with urinary stones represent a wide spectrum of different case scenarios that need a judicious clinical decision to prioritise management.",

The BAUS COVID-19 strategy for laparoscopic/robotic surgery published on March 30, 2020 [4] noted the arguments circulating about the safety of laparoscopic surgery in the COVID-19 era and concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to either recommend or prohibit the use of laparoscopy. Caution is required in making decisions on whether to operate in all urgent but nonemergency cases. Aerosolisation, which can occur in all types of surgery, carries a theoretical risk to staff. Laparoscopic surgery is potentially an aerosol-generating procedure (like electrocautery of any blood/tissue/fluid). The BAUS recommendation is to wear full personal protective equipment with FFP2/3 masks and visors when operating on a COVID-positive or COVID-suspected patient. In addition, minimising operating time, maximising patient safety, and promoting expedited patient recovery are key considerations to weigh against the possible risk of viral aerosolisation. Minimisation of chest complications (atelectasis/pneumonia) may be very important in reducing the overall risk to the patient from surgery [4].",
