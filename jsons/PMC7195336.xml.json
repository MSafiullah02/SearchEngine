Clinical trial results from China2 had not yet been published in peer-reviewed form at the time of writing, and data from France3 are useful but preliminary. The French study was nonrandomized, and the preliminary report included only viral RNA detection from nasopharyngeal swabs as its primary end point rather than clinical outcomes. Although limited, the data have been sufficient to prompt recommendations for treatment from national agencies in China and Italy. The overall safety of these drugs has been established over several decades of use, with good cardiovascular safety profiles in small studies. However, cases of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP) have been reported. Larger cohort studies have focused on the low risk of retinopathy associated with chronic administration. Rare cases of cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular block, and bundle branch block have been reported during both acute and chronic administration.",

Expert opinion may be helpful in determining how best to mitigate risk for patients with prolonged baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) who have COVID-19. The use of other drugs or medical conditions that may prolong the QT interval or otherwise interact with these medications may increase risk of adverse events. Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval in vulnerable patients may be exacerbated in older patients, by coexistent cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy, ischemia, heart failure, or bradycardia, and by other conditions such as diabetes, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, or renal failure. It is possible that severe cases of COVID-19 would be more vulnerable to QT interval prolongation as well. It is likely that patients at higher clinical risk of drug-induced arrhythmia would also be at higher risk for more severe infectious complications and are more likely to be treated as inpatients, in which case ECG monitoring would more likely be indicated for supportive medical care. This is reflected in the recommendations below.",

Methods to mitigate risk are warranted, but should not impose undue increased risk of infection to other patients or health care workers, or undue increase in demand on medical resources during a time of crisis with potential restrictions on access to personal protective equipment, drug therapy, and even care providers.1 If COVID-19 antimicrobial drugs reduce mortality rate by even 5%, it is likely that this would constitute a substantial net benefit compared with the risk of drug-induced sudden death, recognizing that the absolute levels of risk and benefit are unclear at present. Clinical risk scores may be useful in minimizing risk, but ultimately, the decision whether to require extra testing and monitoring will require balancing of potential individual benefit against the risk of individual and population harm. This includes the local prevalence of COVID-19 infection and associated risk of subjecting patients to important, albeit discretionary, testing such as ECG. It is recognized that assessment of the balance of risks may differ in different jurisdictions.",
