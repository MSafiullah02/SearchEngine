In this work we present results of the application of the Protein Contact Network (PCN) paradigm to the complex SARS-CoV spike -ACE2 relative to both 2003 SARS and the recent 2019 -CoV.",

This region is thus a good candidate to intervene in the allosteric regulation of the complex formation and, therefore, it is worth to investigate allosteric drugs targeting this region. A similar active region appears at the junction of the fusion peptide to the body of the spike protein, yet the active region in the SARS CoV S/ACE2 is more compact than in the nCoV2019 S/ACE2.",
