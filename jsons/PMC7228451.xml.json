Although there is paucity of high-quality evidence to guide ECMO practice in many areas, these recommendations are based on available evidence,12\u201314 existing best practice guidelines,15\u201324 experience from previous infectious disease outbreaks,25\u201329 ethical principles,30\u201335 and consensus opinion from experts.
