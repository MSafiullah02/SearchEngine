            "text": "It is well known that Escherichia coli and Cryptosporidium spp. are involved in the multiple aetiology of the scouring syndrome (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996). This syndrome is an important cause of neonatal deaths or losses pre\u2010weaning in sheep, especially in housed lambs. In the three most prominent farmer associations in the region of the study, losses are estimated to be approximately 3.14 million Euros per year (Agriculture Research Service, personal communication). These significant financial losses are attributed to the costs of treatment, the loss in production and the death of lambs, often by endotoxaemia. Endotoxaemia is defined as the presence of endotoxin in blood and is characterized by signs caused by the organic reaction against the lipopolysaccharide component of the outer leaflet of the outermembrane of Gram\u2010negative bacteria (MacKay, 2002). If serum endotoxin concentration could be used to predict the probable success of treatment, then this measurement could be used to avoid unnecessary costs associated with treating lambs with a very reduced likelihood of survival.",

This test has been used to measure endotoxaemia in humans and animals suffering from different disorders (Hodgson et al., 1999; Haussman et al., 2000; Wittek et al., 2004). It has been shown that this method is more sensitive than other available methods for the measurement of endotoxin (Fujiwara et al., 1999). The chromogenic LAL test is as much as 300 times more sensitive than the rabbit pyrogen test (Hurley, 1995). Endotoxaemia measurements obtained by chromogenic LAL assay have been used to predict non\u2010survival or a favourable outcome in horses with acute abdominal disease (Barton and Collatos, 1999). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of endotoxaemia, assessed by LAL assay, in determining the prognosis for the survival of lambs with severe diarrhoea in order to avoid unnecessary treatment expenses in lambs with a very poor chance of survival.",

Although gut wall is an efficient barrier preventing these substances from crossing, a small quantity is absorbed into the portal circulation.

The concentrations detected were 0 in the 31% of the control lambs and very low in the rest (range 0\u20130.36 ng/ml).

High concentrations of endotoxin may be attributed to the ischaemic injury caused to the digestive mucous barrier by bacterial overgrowth, decrease of intestinal pH or inflammatory intestinal disorder. In this instance, large quantities of endotoxin are absorbed from the intestine, overwhelming the detoxifying ability of the liver and increasing the concentration of endotoxin in the peripheral circulation (King and Gerring, 1988; Haussman et al., 2000).",

Halofuginone has been reported to be highly effective against Cryptosporidium spp. infection in calves (Lefay et al., 2001). Spectinomycin has been shown to be an effective treatment for E. coli infections in lambs (Hodgson et al., 1999). In the current experiment, combined spectinomycin and halofuginone treatment, together with an oral rehydration solution, was an effective treatment for scouring in lambs with a serum endotoxin concentration \u22640.30 ng/ml but not in lambs with a serum endotoxin level 0.50 ng/mL. Similarly, lambs that recovered had a significantly lower average serum endotoxin measurement compared with lambs in which treatment was unsuccessful. In addition, the deceased lambs showed gross pathological changes consistent with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection. This suggests the potential prognostic value of serum endotoxin measurement and the possibility of using serum endotoxin measurement to predict the likely success of treatment. Treatment of lambs with serum endotoxin levels above an established reference range would carry no guarantee of success.",
