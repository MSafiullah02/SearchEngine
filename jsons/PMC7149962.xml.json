Hundreds of antiviral agents have been developed since the second half of the twentieth century, and viruses can generally find evolutionary pathways to continue replication in their presence. The same is true of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The belief that bacterial diseases were in their way toward extinction was quite widespread in the middle of the twentieth century. Sir M. Burnet wrote in his 1966 textbook: \u201cAnd since bacterial infections are, with unimportant exceptions, amenable to treatment with one or other of the new drugs, our real problems are likely to be concerned with virus diseases\u201d (Burnet, 1966). In 1932, a prominent Spanish medical doctor, G. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, declared: \u201cIn the year 2000 cancer will be a historical disease. Infections will be almost entirely absent as a cause of mortality.\u201d (On a personal note, when I joined University of California Irvine in 1969 to work as postdoctoral student with R.C. Warner, I attended some biology courses in which the teachers expressed to students that infectious diseases would disappear in a few decades as a consequence of the use of antibiotics and antiviral agents.) Predictions in science tend to fail.",

Other external influences such as vaccination or immunotherapy, particularly using monoclonal antibodies, can also evoke the selection of viral subpopulations capable of replicating in the presence of those components inherent to an immune response. Thus, selective constraints intended to limit RNA virus replication meet with the broad and dynamic repertoire of variants ingrained in quasispecies dynamics. Two space-time levels of the effects of drugs or vaccines are distinguished in coming sections: (i) short-term consequences for the individual in the form of treatment or vaccination failure and (ii) long-term consequences at the population level in the field, or vaccine-driven evolution of the antigenic properties of viruses.",

            "text": "Viral diseases are an important burden for human health and agriculture (Bloom and Lambert, 2003). Virus evolution, through the basic mechanisms exposed in previous chapters, can influence the two major strategies to combat viral infections: prevention by vaccination and treatment by antiviral inhibitors. In considering the design of a new antiviral vaccine, the extent of diversity in the field of the virus to be controlled is critical. The natural evolution of the virus may result in the circulation of one major antigenic type or to the co-circulation of multiple antigenic types. The vaccine composition (independently of the type of vaccine; see Section 8.3.1) must match the antigenic composition of the virus to be controlled. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) circulates as a single serotype while foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) circulates as seven serotypes and diverse subtypes, and the antigenic types are unevenly distributed in different geographical locations. A monovalent vaccine made of the prevailing antigenic type of HAV should be sufficient to confer protection, while a multivalent vaccine composed of several types or subtypes is required to confer protection against FMDV, and the antigenic composition should be selected depending on the circulating viruses. This is why anti-FMD vaccines of different composition are used in different world areas at a given time, and vaccine composition must be periodically updated to maintain its efficacy. Thus, one effect of virus evolution relevant to vaccine design derives from the necessity to prepare a vaccine that mirrors the antigenic composition of the virus to be controlled. In the case of live-attenuated antiviral vaccines, the evolution of the vaccine virus while it replicates in the vaccinee is a risk factor to produce virulent derivatives.",

            "text": "A first basic requisite for the preparation of a vaccine against a viral agent is the understanding of the immune response evoked by the virus when it infects the organism to be protected (activation of B and T lymphocytes for antibody production, cellular responses, and generation of memory cells) and correlates of protection (Bloom and Lambert, 2003, Hagan et al., 2015). For each virus-host system experiments are necessary to try to establish the determinants of protection, which is not a simple issue. The discussions in coming paragraphs are focused on the relevance of virus evolution in vaccine efficacy, irrespective of the type of protection afforded by the vaccine. What we term \u201cprotection\u201d may mean total absence of replication of the infecting virus (termed \u201csterilizing\u201d immunity) or absence of disease manifestations despite infection and some virus replication. As a general initial statement which is widely accepted by vaccinologists, a vaccine is likely to be effective when it evokes an immune response which is similar to the response elicited by the authentic viral pathogen when it produces disease successfully overcome by the infected organism (Evans and Kaslow, 1997, Bloom and Lambert, 2003). We refer to this as the basic principle of vaccinology. When infection by an antigenically constant virus produces lifelong immunity (i.e., measles virus infection) a vaccine is likely to evoke long-lasting protection. In contrast, if a patient cured of a virus can be reinfected by the same (or a closely related) virus (i.e., hepatitis C virus infection) a vaccine\u2014at least one prepared by standard methodology\u2014is unlikely to evoke protection.",

            "text": "Some points to be considered in the design of antiviral vaccines are listed in Box 8.1\n. They are intended to minimize selection of vaccine-escape mutants and favor the success of vaccination campaigns. Some of the recommendations deserve further comment. First, a basic knowledge of virus evolutionary dynamics and how it affects virus antigenic stability (or lack of) is essential. The fact that a methodology is available (i.e., vectors that can express large amounts of antigens displaying good immunogenicity) does not guarantee vaccine efficacy, and even less if correlates of protection are not understood. The order of efficacy of different vaccine designs proposed in Box 8.1 is justified both by the basic principle of vaccinology and by the mechanisms of selection of antibody (Ab)- and cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)-escape mutants by viruses. Single amino acid substitutions at B- and T-cell epitopes in viral proteins are often sufficient to elude neutralization by the corresponding cognate-specific antibody or to escape recognition by a clonal CTL population. For many viruses, the frequency of monoclonal antibody-escape mutants has been measured in 10\u2212 4 to 10\u2212 6, even in clonal populations obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and that have undergone a limited number of replication rounds (Section 7.4.2 in Chapter 7). The generation of immune-escape variants can result in lack of vaccine efficacy, contribute to viral persistence (Pircher et al., 1990, Weidt et al., 1995, Ciurea et al., 2000, Ciurea et al., 2001, Richman et al., 2003, Pawlotsky, 2006), and provoke vaccination-induced virus evolution (Section 8.3.2). In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), antibody-escape variants are incessantly being produced in vivo to the point that virus replication continues despite the antibody response (Richman et al., 2003, Bailey et al., 2004).Box 8.1Vaccine Designs and Vaccination Strategies for Antigenically Variable Viruses\n\u2022Prior to the planning of a vaccine strategy, it is essential to review what is known about genetic and antigenic variation of the virus to be controlled (whether it is a DNA or RNA virus displaying high- or low-fidelity replication, antigenic diversity in the field, location of B- and T-cell epitopes, etc.).\u2022Carry out research to understand the correlates of protection.\u2022In keeping with the basic principle of vaccinology, from the point of view of inducing a protective response the preferred order of vaccine types is as follows: live attenuated > whole virus inactivated = empty viral particles > multiple immunogenic viral proteins > a single immunogenic viral protein > mixtures of synthetic peptides, dendrimeric scaffolds, peptide arrays > a single synthetic peptide.\u2022International vaccination programs should be carried out as quickly as possible.\u2022Programs to update the antigenic composition of vaccines should be implemented.\nBased on Domingo and Holland (1992).",

            "text": "The frequency of selection of mutants that can escape a number (n) of components in which we could hypothetically separate a global immune response is far lower than the frequency of escape to a single (a, b, c, etc.) of the i components of the response. Making a simple mathematical abstraction that is applicable also to antiviral-escape mutants (Section 8.4), the frequency of mutants that escape n components of an immune response is the product of frequencies of escape to each individual component [10\u2212 a\n \u00d7 10\u2212 b\n \u00d7 10\u2212 c\n \u00d7 \u2026 10\u2212 i\n = 10\u2212(a + b + c + \u2026 i)]. This is obviously an oversimplification because it is not realistic to dissect the selective impact of a complex immune response into discrete components. A virus generally includes multiple antigenic sites and each of them is often composed of several overlapping or nonoverlapping epitopes; in addition, a virus has several T-cell epitopes in different structural and nonstructural proteins, and each epitope displays a different degree of relative dominance. The above abstraction reflects, however, the advantage of stimulating the host immune system with a sufficiently broad array of B- and T-cell epitopes to prevent selection of vaccine-escape mutants due to a high genetic and phenotypic barrier (compare with the barrier to drug resistance described in Section 8.4.2). Therefore, selection of vaccine-escape viral mutants is more likely with synthetic peptidic vaccines, than with whole virus-attenuated or inactivated vaccines because the latter present a broad epitopic repertoire to the immune system. New prospects for attenuated vaccines have been opened with the engineering of viruses with suboptimal replication fidelity or deoptimized codon or codon pair usage (Coleman et al., 2008, Vignuzzi et al., 2008, Cheng et al., 2015). Selection of escape-mutants by peptidic vaccines that evoked partial protection of cattle was documented with FMDV (Taboga et al., 1997, Tami et al., 2003). The arguments in favor of multiepitopic presentation are also endorsed by a notorious scarcity of licensed peptidic vaccines for viral diseases despite horrendous economic investments (orders of magnitude greater than investments in quasispecies research!). Use of a complex, multiepitopic vaccine, however, need not prevent long-term selection of antigenic virus variants as a result of vaccine usage, an important still largely underexplored topic discussed in Section 8.3.2.",

Evidence of vaccination-induced DNA and RNA virus evolution is increasing, and it has been documented with bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus-1, Marek\u2019s disease virus, porcine circovirus 2, and classical swine fever virus, among others (Valarcher et al., 2000, Muylkens et al., 2006, Ji et al., 2014, Kekarainen et al., 2014, reviews in Gandon et al., 2003, Schat and Baranowski, 2007). The timing of dominance of CTL-escape mutants of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was influenced by vaccination, and the process could be analyzed by penetration into the mutant spectra of the relevant viral populations (Loh et al., 2008).",

In addition, for massive vaccinations in veterinary medicine, damage to the vaccine and improper administration are additional problems. Vaccination may occasionally promote the selection not only of antigenic variants but also of host cell tropism, host range or virulent variants (Swayne and Kapczynski, 2008, Kirkwood, 2010, Read et al., 2015). To what extent the widespread use of vaccination can contribute to antigenic variation relative to other factors (genetic drift due to genetic bottlenecks, etc.) is not known.

A mutation conferring resistance to the inhibitor will occur at the same rate in each of them, assuming that the mutation rate is independent of the presence of the inhibitor. However, after its occurrence, the proportion of viral RNAs harboring the mutation will decrease depending on the inhibitor concentration. The time at which the effect of the inhibitor will be manifested depends on the inhibitor target. In the example of Figure 8.1 we assume that the concentration of inhibitor-resistant mutants will decrease in the replication complexes, reaching resistant mutant frequencies of 10\u2212 3, 10\u2212 4, and 10\u2212 5 in compartments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The frequency of inhibitor-resistant mutants in the entire cell, tissue, or organism at that time will be given by the weighted average of mutation frequencies at the individual compartments. In the case of a virus producing viremia, assuming no bottleneck effects or differential selection for other traits, the frequency of resistant mutants calculated for the virus in blood should reflect the average frequency in all compartments that supply virus to blood.

The diversification of HCV into genotypes 1a and 1b influenced the genetic barrier to resistance to the NS3/4A protease inhibitor telaprevir [formula (20) in Figure 8.3]. One of the amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to telaprevir is R155K in NS3. In genotype 1a, the triplet encoding R155 is AGA; therefore, a single nucleotide transition G \u2192 A can yield the triplet AAA which encodes K. In genotype 2b, the triplet encoding R-155 is CGA; therefore, two nucleotide changes (transversion C \u2192 A and transition G \u2192 A) are required to reach AAA, the triplet encoding K. Reaching the alternative AAG codon for K would require the same or a larger number of mutations (see Section 4.3.1 in Chapter 4 for another example of how the synonymous codon usage can influence an evolutionary outcome). The requirement of transitions versus transversions will affect the genetic barrier to antiviral resistance. Most viral polymerases tend to produce transition mutations more readily than transversions presumably because in the course of RNA elongation it is easier to misincorporate a purine by another purine than by a pyrimidine, and the same for pyrimidine misincorporations (Chapter 2). Mutation preference is one of several factors that determine the frequency of drug-escape mutants. Thus, evolution may diversify viruses to display different genetic barriers to the same drugs. To complicate matters even more, since in many cases several independent mutations may confer resistance to the same drug, it has to be considered also that the genetic barrier to one inhibitor may be affected by the presence of other inhibitors (Beerenwinkel et al., 2005).",

When a drug-resistance mutation inflicts a high fitness cost, a likely result is reversion of the mutation when the virus replicates in the absence of the drug. An alternative outcome is that compensatory mutations are introduced in the genome so that viral fitness increases while maintaining the inhibitor-resistance mutation. The two outcomes are not mutually exclusive and may contribute to the multiple, transient selection pathways observed by the application of deep sequencing to monitor the response of a viral population to specific selective force (Tsibris et al., 2009, Fischer et al., 2010, Cale et al., 2011, Kortenhoeven et al., 2015) (see Section 6.3 in Chapter 6). A high fitness cost may prevent or delay selection of escape mutants. Sofosbuvir [formula (21) in Figure 8.3] is a very effective NS5B (viral polymerase) inhibitor of HCV. Amino acid substitution S282T in NS5B has been associated with sofosbuvir resistance, and the substitution has been detected in patients and in some natural isolates of HCV. In one of several clinical studies on sofosbuvir efficacy, the mutant spectrum composition of HCV genotype 2b in an infected patient treated with the drug was followed by NGS at baseline (prior to initiation of treatment), in the course of treatment, and posttreatment. The frequency of S282T was 0.05% at baseline, indicating preexistence of resistance mutations despite no exposure of the virus to the drug (Section 8.6). Two days after initiation of sofosbuvir treatment the level of S282T decreased to 0.03%, and viral breakthrough was detected 4 weeks later when 99.8% of the viral population included S282T. During the posttreatment period, genomes with the wild-type S282 amino acid regained dominance that was attributed to true reversion of mutant genomes rather than outgrowth of baseline wild-type genomes (Hedskog et al., 2015). This result suggests a high phenotypic barrier for sofosbuvir, but that HCV has mechanisms to overcome this barrier. The complexities of virus-host interactions render the elucidation on the pathways exploited by a virus to overcome the phenotypic barrier to a drug a highly empirical endeavor. The hope is that by combining high phenotypic barrier inhibitors, the forced reversion of the resistance mutations for survival may drive the virus to extinction (Chapter 9).",

For viruses that replicate in cell culture, it is possible to estimate the minimal viral population size needed to select a drug-resistant mutant which is generally positively correlated with the genetic barrier (Figure 8.5\n). In the hypothetical example of the figure, a viral population is composed of inhibitor-sensitive viruses (blue spheres), and a low level of inhibitor-resistant viruses (red spheres). The proportion of inhibitor-resistant viruses is given by the mutational pressure (e.g., at a frequency of 10\u2212 4, which is increased in the picture for clarity). Passage of a small amount of virus (e.g., 102 infectious virus in the small circle at the upper part of the figure) will exclude the mutant virus (red spheres) that will be maintained at the basal level dictated by mutational pressure in the course of passages (limited to two in the figure for simplicity). Selection of escape mutants is precluded by the limited population size at each transfer. In contrast, if the population size used for the successive infections is sufficiently large (> 104, larger circles at the bottom that surround both sensitive and resistant viruses), the resistant mutant can become gradually dominant and can be isolated for further studies. To give another example, a single amino acid replacement that requires two mutations (the change from CAG to AUG to attain substitution Q151M in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, associated with resistance to multiple antiretroviral nucleosides) will occur at lower frequency than replacements that require a single mutation. If each of the two mutations reach a frequency of 2 \u00d7 10\u2212 4, the expected frequency of the drug-resistant genomes (ignoring fitness effects) will be (2 \u00d7 10\u2212 4) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 10\u2212 4) = 4 \u00d7 10\u2212 8. Thus, at least 4 \u00d7 108 viral genomes must undergo one round of copying (or a lower number of genomes a proportionally higher number of rounds of copying) to approach a good probability to obtain a drug-resistant genome in that viral population. Population size limitation of a drug selection event is a specific example of how random events may intervene in a process of positive selection (compare with Section 3.2 and Figure 3.2 in Chapter 3; in that figure, the random event that excludes the positively selected population is conceptually equivalent to the insufficient population size depicted in the upper infection series of Figure 8.5).",

An adequate procedure to quantify the phenotypic barrier to resistance is to determine the fitness of the virus expressing the wild-type amino acid (the one that confers drug sensitivity) relative to the virus expressing the substitution that confers resistance; fitness is measured in the absence and presence of the drug (double assay). This is an extension of the determination of fitness vectors described in Section 5.1.1 of Chapter 5, as depicted in Figure 8.7\n; the assays are best performed in cell culture, although use of explants or in vivo assays are also feasible. Two parameters can be calculated: the fitness cost inflicted by the amino acid substitution associated with resistance in the absence of the drug, and the selective advantage conferred by the substitution in the presence of the drug. In the presence of the drug, the mutant will yield a fitness value f + DRUG > 1 relative to the wild type (necessarily if the mutation confers resistance and virus viability is preserved). In the absence of the drug, f \u2212 DRUG\n \u2264 1 relative to the wild type quantifies the fitness cost of the resistance mutation; the lower the value of f-DRUG, the higher the fitness cost. We define the selective strength of the resistance mutation as f \n+ DRUG\n /f \u2212 DRUG. For example, if we put arbitrary numbers (unrelated to values shown in ordinate) to the fitness values in the first graph of Figure 8.7, f + DRUG \n =  1.4 and f \u2212 DRUG \n =  0.8, we obtain a selective strength of 1.7. For the vectors in the second graph, if f + DRUG \n =  3.6 and f \u2212 DRUG \n =  0.1, the selective strength is 36. High selective strength means an important selective advantage conferred by the amino acid substitution for the virus replication in the presence of the drug despite a high fitness cost inflicted by the substitution (compare with Section 4.2 in Chapter 4 for the trade-off and \u201cno free lunch\u201d concepts). If the substitution does not entail any fitness cost (f \u2212 DRUG \n =  1), the fitness value in the presence of the drug equals the selective strength. Selective strength can be calculated for a mutation or group of mutations that confer resistance to a drug used at a given concentration in a defined environment. The limitations of fitness measurements (environment dependence, etc.) described in Section 5.1.2 of Chapter 5 apply here. Since viral genomic sequences may vary in the course of fitness assays, a limited number of passages and triplicate parallel assays are recommended. If a substitution entails a high fitness cost, direct reversion of the substitution or incorporation of compensatory mutations may occur. Nucleotide sequence monitoring in the course of the assay should reinforce the conclusions.",

Several possibilities can account for the pertinacious occurrence and selection of drug-resistant, viable viral mutants. One possibility, supported by some experimental and clinical observations, is that a drug-resistant phenotype may be achieved through a number of alternative genetic modifications. Even if a specific amino acid substitution\u2014that would serve as the most direct and effective determinant of drug resistance\u2014were highly detrimental or lethal for the virus, alternative mutations can often be found that lead to a similar resistance phenotype, or at least a sufficient resistance to permit finding compensatory mutations. Not only the connectivity among points of sequence space plays a role but also the fact that several points in sequence space map into the same (or similar) drug-resistance phenotype. This phenotypic redundancy applies to both standard nonmutagenic inhibitors and to mutagenic inhibitors. The cascade of mutations that confer resistance of picornaviruses to the mutagenic purine analog ribavirin illustrates how alternative amino acid substitutions in the viral polymerase (some being genuine resistance mutations and others acting as compensatory substitutions to maintain polymerase function) can lead to the ribavirin-resistance phenotype (discussed in detail in Chapter 9).",

In this view, drug resistance would have been gradually built as a consequence of coevolution (Section 4.5 of Chapter 4) between virus replicative and gene expression machineries and the \u201cspace\u201d of chemical compounds that interacted with them. Mechanisms of drug resistance might have had their roots in molecular events repeatedly experienced as viruses evolved in an interactive manner with protocellular and cellular metabolites in our biosphere. Discrimination in favor of small molecule substrates compatible with a flow of genome replication and gene expression, and avoidance of perturbing intruders that could alter catalytic activities, should have been positively selected.

This occurs with thymidine analog resistance mutation (or TAMs) that are typically selected under treatment with AZT or d4T [formulae (10) and (13) in Figure 8.3].

A well-studied example in HIV-1 is the Q151M complex in the reverse transcriptase which includes substitutions A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M.

            "text": "Because of the distance effects that can be exerted among amino acids in viral proteins, substitutions that confer resistance to inhibitors of viral enzymes may lie far from the catalytic site. The effect of drug-resistance mutations on the general catalytic efficiency of a viral enzyme is one of the determinants of the functional barrier to resistance. When an enzymological assay in vitro is available, the effects of specific drug-resistance amino acid substitutions on enzyme activity can be tested, although the observed alteration may not be the only influence on the fitness modification of the corresponding mutant virus. The reason is that most viral proteins (including viral enzymes) are multifunctional and an enzyme activity assay may not capture the range of influences exerted by the enzyme. Regarding the new directly acting antiviral (DAA) agents for HCV, the inhibitors that target the HCV polymerase (NS5B) generally display a higher functional barrier to resistance than the protease inhibitors, and manifest a broader genotype coverage. Fitness decreases entail reductions in viral load and, consequently, decreased probability of viral breakthrough (treatment failure). Nucleotide analogs that bind to conserved residues at or near the active site of the viral polymerase tend to show subtype-independent antiviral activity. Because amino acid substitutions at or near the active site of viral enzymes are likely to inflict a fitness cost, such substitutions are less likely to preexist in treatment-naive patients (Margeridon-Thermet and Shafer, 2010, Sarrazin and Zeuzem, 2010). Interestingly, in the case of HIV-1, mutations conferring resistance to RT inhibitors inflict a lower fitness cost than mutations that confer resistance to protease inhibitors (reviewed in Martinez-Picado and Martinez, 2008). Thus, enzymes that perform similar functions for different viruses may have evolved to display different tolerance to amino acid substitutions. It is not possible to generalize which types of resistance mutations will display high or low functional barriers.",

A few estimates for drug-escape mutants are listed in Table 8.1\n; several observations and characterization of escape mutants have not been accompanied with frequency measurements. A point worth emphasizing is that the quantification of viruses harboring biologically relevant mutations has been possible because an adequate biological assay is available. An antiviral agent or a neutralizing antibody measures the proportion of infectious viral particles that differ from the majority of the population in the relevant resistance trait. There is no reason to suspect that the viral amino acid residues (that are the target of an inhibitor or an antibody) that are substituted to confer the resistance phenotype are on average more prone to variation than other amino acids in viral proteins. This means that if we had additional selective agents to probe other viral sites, we would probably obtain a similar range of variant amino acids than using inhibitors or antibodies. This quite straightforward prediction is another way to state that there is general agreement in the mutation rates and frequencies for viruses being in the range of 10\u2212 3 to 10\u2212 5 substitutions per nucleotide (s/nt), calculated using a variety of biochemical and genetic methods (Chapter 2).",

The argument is parallel to the one used to justify why mutation rates and frequencies differ due to fitness effects of mutations (Chapter 2). Another prediction derived from the above considerations is that mutations conferring resistance to antiviral agents are expected to be detected in viral populations never exposed to the relevant drugs. In other words, the basal level of mutational pressure may be sufficient to provide a detectable level of escape mutants without the need of selection by the selective agent. This is an important aspect of antiviral therapy which is addressed next.",

One of the studies examined the pol gene of 60 HIV-1 genomes obtained directly from lymphocytes of infected patients. Mutation frequencies for independent viral isolates were in the range of 1.6.10\u2212 2 to 3.4.10\u2212 2\n s/nt, while for mutant spectrum components of individual isolates the values were 3.6.10\u2212 3 to 1.1.10\u2212 2\n s/nt. In the virus from these patients, mutation frequencies at the codons for amino acids involved in antiretroviral resistance were very similar to the average mutation frequency for the entire pol gene. Consistently with the mutation frequency values, several mutations that led to amino acid substitutions that conferred resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were identified in patients not subjected to therapy. At the time of the study, the number of antiretroviral agents was still limited and a considerable number of patients were not treated. The authors gave convincing epidemiological arguments that the background of mutations related to antiretroviral resistance was a consequence of high mutation rates and quasispecies dynamics, and not of transmission of resistant virus from individuals that had been subjected to therapy (primary resistance) (N\u00e1jera et al., 1995).",

Despite being the most common, the presence of specific resistance mutations is not the only mechanism of drug resistance. The cell culture system of HCV replication in human hepatoma cells (Lindenbach et al., 2005, Wakita et al., 2005, Zhong et al., 2005) permitted addressing the important issue of HCV resistance to interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1). IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin were the two components of the standard of care treatment against HCV infections until the advent of new therapies based on directly acting antiviral agents in 2014. Natural HCV isolates differ in IFN-\u03b1 sensitivity and the molecular basis of the difference is largely unknown. The study in cell culture consisted in subjecting a clonal population of HCV (termed HCVp0, prepared by electroporation of hepatoma cells with RNA encoding the viral genome, transcribed from a plasmid) to 100 serial passages (of the type described in Section 6.1 of Chapter 6) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 added to the culture medium. Several mutations scattered throughout the HCV genome were associated with IFN-\u03b1 resistance (Perales et al., 2013). The selection of multiple alternative mutations is most likely due to the fact that IFN-\u03b1 evokes a multicomponent antiviral response which is not focused toward a single viral protein (Perales et al., 2014). Unexpectedly, even the control HCV populations (those passaged 100 times in the absence of IFN-\u03b1) displayed a partial (but statistically significant) resistance to IFN-\u03b1, that could not be attributed to endogenous IFN production by the hepatoma cells (Perales et al., 2013).",

HCVp45 and HCVp100 displayed significant increased resistance to all inhibitors tested, as compared with the parental population HCVp0 (Sheldon et al., 2014) (Figure 8.8\n). Passage of HCV entailed an increase of viral fitness and a broadening of the mutant spectrum, as expected (Section 5.4 of Chapter 5). Therefore, a clear possibility was that the broadening of the mutant spectrum increased the frequency of mutations associated with drug resistance, thus explaining the behavior of the multiply passaged HCV populations. The search for the resistant mutations was easier for telaprevir, daclatasvir, and cyclosporin A than for the other drugs because amino acid substitutions in the target protein had been previously identified as responsible for drug resistance. In the case of cyclosporin A resistance, substitutions map in NS5A and NS5B, because the drug binds to cyclophilin A which in turn interacts with NS5A. Analysis of the mutant spectra of HCVp45 and HCVp100 by molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing and by NGS failed to identify specific drug-resistance mutations. Since it could not be excluded that the broadening of the mutant spectrum might have increased the frequency of resistance mutations still to be characterized, two additional tests were performed. One was to determine the kinetics of viral production over a 1000-fold range of MOI in the absence and presence of telaprevir. Both the unpassaged and multiply passaged HCV displayed parallel kinetics at the different MOIs, which excludes that drug resistance was due to the presence of resistance mutations in minority components of the mutant spectrum (Figure 8.8). To further substantiate the findings, biological clones obtained by end-point dilution of the corresponding HCVp0 and HCVp100 populations were tested regarding drug resistance. A biological clone should have eliminated minority genomes that harbored drug-resistance mutations since biological cloning is the most severe form of bottleneck event (Sections 6.2 and 6.5 in Chapter 6). The biological clones did not display any decrease in drug resistance as compared with their corresponding parental, uncloned populations (Sheldon et al., 2014).",

Both mechanisms may act conjointly during viral infections in vivo. Some studies with HCV have documented drug-resistance phenotypes in infected patients, in the absence of specific drug-resistance mutations (Sullivan et al., 2013, Sato et al., 2015). In fact, prolonged chronic HCV infections represent an adequate scenario for fitness increase due to extended rounds of infections in the same host liver. As a consequence, chronic infections may be prone to display fitness-associated multidrug-resistance phenotypes, in the absence of drug-resistance mutations. The multiple mechanisms of drug resistance related to quasispecies dynamics justify even further the need of new antiviral strategies as presented in Chapter 9.",

            "text": "High viral loads are predictors of disease progression. For HIV-1 and other lentiviruses, an efficient early control of virus replication by the host immune response is generally associated with limited disease severity. In HIV-1, the viral load that follows after the initial immune response to the virus is referred to as the \u201cset point.\u201d In the absence of early therapy, low set points in HIV-1 are generally attributed to a strong cellular immune response, likely influenced by host and viral factors. [This and other aspects of HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis have been reviewed in excellent monographs by Levy (2007)]. A low set point predicts an asymptomatic outcome, and this is generally the case for viruses that establish persistent rather than acute infections. Again, viral population numbers, derived from the virus-host interaction, play a critical role in the result of an infection. Given a host environment, an initial high viral fitness during the early stages of viral replication can promote disease manifestations. An example was provided by the progression toward disease of a cohort of individuals that were infected during blood transfusion with an HIV-1 containing a large deletion in Nef. After more than 15 years, some of the infected individuals showed clinical signs, probably as a result of accumulation of mutations in the HIV-1 genome that compensated for the lack of Nef, an adaptor protein that mediates replication and pathogenesis (reviewed in Arien and Verhasselt, 2008). More generally, fitness-decreasing (but not lethal) genetic lesions in a viral genome may be compensated by additional genomic mutations that become increasingly dominant in the course of further viral replication. The kinetics of fitness gain will depend on the nature of the lesion and the functional implications of the altered protein or genomic regulatory region (Chapter 5).",

Fitness gain will be more effective, the higher is the load of actively replicating virus in the infected organism. High replicative capacity and fitness sustain high viral loads. The reason for this basic feature of viral population dynamics is that given a basal mutation rate, a large number of replicating genomes entails a correspondingly higher probability that a required mutation for fitness gain can be produced. The events involved are a specific case of search for adaptive mutations in terms of exploration of sequence space as discussed in Section 3.7 of Chapter 3. While active viral replication, high load, and high fitness favor progression of the infection and disease manifestations, the fourth parameter included in the large arrow of Figure 8.9, mutant spectrum diversity, has an optimal range. Too low or too high intrapopulation diversity is detrimental to virus adaptability. Insufficient diversity limits adaptability to complex environments (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006), while excess diversity may force the virus to cross an extinction threshold, and this is the basis of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral therapy (Chapter 9). An additional implication of the parameters shown in Figure 8.9 for antiviral interventions is that fitness decrease is recognized as an alternative to inhibition of viral replication to control viral infections (Clementi, 2008, Clementi and Lazzarin, 2010, reviewed in Domingo et al. (2012)). Thus, key features of quasispecies dynamics have a direct implication on the management of viral infections.",

Biotechnological developments have favored the design of chemically defined vaccines (consisting of expressed immunogenic proteins, synthetic peptides, or peptide arrays), without the need to handle or administer live virus. One of the most naive manifestations of trust in biotechnology in the middle of the twentieth century was the belief that a catalog of plasmids encoding the antigenic proteins of the circulating types of a pathogenic virus would suffice to prepare the required vaccine as needed. Concerning influenza vaccines, W.I. Beveridge wrote the following: \u201cThe first objective would be to capture the full range of influenza A subtypes. Their antigens would be studied by specialists at central laboratories and made available for the preparation of particular vaccines if and when required. It might be feasible to stockpile some vaccine against all the principal hemagglutinin antigens to be used in a fire brigade type of action as soon as an incipient pandemic is spotted\u201d (Beveridge, 1977). Naivety is also perceived in current designs of universal vaccines based on conserved antigens. It is remarkable how our present perception of viral populations differs from the views expressed in the W.I. Beveridge book and in other writings at the boom of implementation of DNA recombinant techniques. With a conceptual similarity, in medical practice, monotherapy with an antiviral agent was traditionally preferred over drug mixtures. (The change of paradigm was largely a consequence of the AIDS epidemic, and it was publicly expressed by the pioneer hepatologist S. Sherlock in a summary address of an International Symposium on Viral Hepatitis held in Madrid in 1998.) The change of perspective is clear.",

It is unlikely that when used in isolation, they can be converted into useful antiviral therapies, because resistant mutants are likely to be selected. Yet, they could be part of combinations with other antiviral inhibitors to provide a larger antiviral barrier (Chapter 9). A similar fate is likely for interfering RNAs (Boden et al., 2003, Gitlin et al., 2005, Herrera-Carrillo and Berkhout, 2015, McDonagh et al., 2015). To a large extent, the failures of defined chemical entities (oligonucleotides, ribozymes, small molecule inhibitors, etc.) to control virus replication and spread are a consequence of their targeting a very defined viral genomic sequence combined with the adaptability of viral populations. Combination of multiple such elements have been envisaged and tested, but off target effects and the adaptive potential of viruses are likely to limit their efficacy. Unfortunately, biotechnological developments that have been so positive for many research areas and practical applications tend to simplify the types of agents to prevent disease or inhibit virus replication, ignoring the inherent complexity of the object to be controlled. Success is unlikely when \u201ccomplexity\u201d is combated with \u201csimplicity.\u201d An increased understanding of viral population dynamics over the last decades has changed the picture dramatically, by providing an interpretation of \u201cvirus escape\u201d as a general and largely unavoidable phenomenon. Such an awareness has pushed the development of new antiviral designs, which are fundamentally centered in two strategies: combination of multiple, independently acting elements or fitness decrease through excess mutations (Chapter 9).",

This is the case with elite controllers in the case of HIV-1 infection, and individuals infected with HCV who will not progress toward liver disease. In the cases in which such nonprogression can be anticipated by viral and host parameters, it may be justified to exclude some patients from aggressive interventions (Suthar and Harries, 2015). As a general rule, however, the potential benefits of early treatment are obvious not only to avoid disease on an individual basis, but also to diminish the chances of virus transmission (reviewed in Suthar and Harries, 2015; see also Sections 7.1 and 7.7 in Chapter 7 regarding the relevance of viral population numbers in transmission). Restricting the number of treated patients for economic reasons will result in more expensive public health interventions when the infected individuals develop disease.",

Information to the public should aim at limiting the spread of disease, that is, undertaking personal and collective actions to reduce the R\n0 value for a given virus (Chapter 7, Section 7.2). As an illustration of this key point, there was a quite extensive information campaign on HIV-1 and AIDS in developed countries during the early decades of HIV-1 spread, while the information about other potentially threatening viruses such as Ebola or the severe acute or Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS, respectively) coronaviruses was more limited.",

Yet, the evolutionary mechanisms available to viruses have successfully coped with many selective pressures, notably vaccines that do not evoke a broad immune response or treatment with antiviral agents. A common scenario with obvious commercial and sometimes even political influences is to test a new vaccine with an animal host, be it the authentic host or an animal model, and obtain full protection when the animal is challenged with a virus that matches the antigenic composition of the vaccine. Following the initial excitement, very often the vaccine displays only partial protection when tested in the natural environment. Somewhat parallel arguments can be made about clinical trials for antiviral agents, usually performed initially with selected groups of patients. This chapter has attempted to emphasize how the complexity of viral populations is a serious (often underestimated) difficulty to prevent and treat viral disease. Examination of the molecular mechanisms exploited by viruses to persist despite interventions suggests two major lines of action: first, a more judicious use of existing tools, that should consider the complexity of viral populations and their dynamics. Complexity cannot be combated with simplicity. Second, the need to design new antiviral strategies, a topic addressed in Chapter 9.",
