Although both methods reduced environmental contamination significantly compared with cleaning alone, hydrogen peroxide achieved a significantly greater reduction (91% vs 30% decrease in proportion of samples with C. difficile, p<0.005).33 A prospective cohort study provided evidence for the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide when used for terminal decontamination after standard cleaning in significantly reducing the acquisition of multi-drug-resistant organisms in patients subsequently admitted to the rooms (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.7).

A multi-variate analysis suggested that both severity of underlying illness and room assignment were independently associated with the acquisition of HCAI or colonisation. However, these findings may have been biased by poor discrimination of patients colonised on admission because of limited surveillance cultures, poor agreement in defining cases of HCAI, and incomplete adjustment for confounders in the multi-variate analysis.39 Evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies and their contribution to reductions in HCAI is therefore not currently available.",

The transient flora are made up of microorganisms acquired by touching contaminated surfaces such as the environment, patients or other people, and are readily transferred to the next person or object touched. They may include a range of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as MRSA, Acinetobacter or other multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.1 If transferred into susceptible sites such as invasive devices or wounds, these microorganisms can cause life-threatening infections. Transmission to non-vulnerable sites may leave a patient colonised with pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant organisms, which may result in an HCAI at some point in the future.",

ABHR was equivalent to no intervention (0.06 log10 cfu/mL, 95% CI \u22120.34 to 0.45 log10 cfu/mL).80 In the second study, three ABHR preparations with a minimum 60% alcohol concentration were compared with antiseptic (CHG) soap and water. Antiseptic soap and water reduced spore counts significantly compared with each of the ABHRs (CHG vs Isagel, p=0.005; CHG vs Endure, p=0.010; CHG vs Purell, p=0.005). In addition, 30% of the residual spores were readily transferred by handshake following the use of ABHR.81 Recent evidence from a laboratory study that compared the efficacy of liquid soap and water and ABHR with and without CHG against H1N1 influenza virus demonstrated that all the hand hygiene protocols were effective in reducing virus copies.82 A further study that compared the use of liquid soap and water and 65% ethanol hand sanitisers for the removal of Rhinovirus indicated that the hand sanitisers were more effective than soap and water.83\n",

This demonstrated a reduction in episodes of HCAI and a saving of $23.7 for every $1 spent on the programme when future costs were considered. Sensitivity analyses showed that the programme remained cost saving in all alternative scenarios.84 ABHR is likely to be less costly and result in greater compliance.",

Analysis also identified that the publication of the Health Act and the Department of Health improvement team visits were associated with reductions in MRSA and C.difficile. In the hospital-wide study,84 the authors demonstrated a decrease in the cumulative incidence of HCAI caused by MRSA (change in level, p=0.03; change in trend, p=0.04) and XDRAB (change in level, p=0.78; change in trend, p<0.001) during the intervention period. Hand hygiene compliance was significantly correlated with increased consumption of ABHR, and improved overall from 43.3% in 2004 to 95.6% in 2007 (p<0.001). Hand hygiene compliance was also significantly correlated with professional categories of healthcare workers (p<0.001) in both general wards and ICUs (p<0.001).",

In other circumstances, such as where the agent is transmitted via droplet rather than aerosol or where the level of aerosol exposure is low, the risk assessment may conclude that other forms of RPE (e.g. APF10/FFP2) or a physical barrier (e.g. surgical face mask) may be appropriate, such as when caring for patients with influenza.

A similar number (52%) reported fearing sharps injuries, and nearly half (45%) reported that they had not received training from their employer on safe needle use.190 The 2012 \u2018Eye of the Needle\u2019 report from the Health Protection Agency confirms that healthcare workers continue to be exposed to bloodborne virus infections, even though such exposures are largely preventable.191 The number of reported occupational exposures almost doubled from 276 in 2002 to 541 in 2011, with almost half of all exposures occurring in nurses. However, in 2011, medical and dental professions reported a similar number of occupational exposures as nursing professions, with exposures in these groups increasing by 131% between 2002 and 2011. The report draws attention to the need for healthcare providers to comply with the European Council Directive 2010/32/EU and adopt safety devices in order to prevent sharps injuries.",

A review of needlestick injuries in Scotland suggested that 56% of injuries would \u2018probably\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019 have been prevented if a safety device had been used.212 However, some studies have identified a range of barriers to the expected reduction in injuries, including staff resistance to using new devices, complexity of device operation or improper use, and poor training.2 A comprehensive report and product review conducted in the USA provides background information and guidance on the need for and use of needlestick-prevention devices, but also gives advice on establishing and evaluating a sharps injury prevention programme.205 It reported that all devices have limitations in relation to cost, applicability and/or effectiveness. Some of the devices available are more expensive than standard devices, may not be compatible with existing equipment, and may be associated with an increase in bloodstream infection rates if used incorrectly.213\n",

In general, all of these five studies suggested that antiseptic-impregnated or antimicrobial-coated short-term indwelling urethral catheters can significantly prevent or delay the onset of CAUTI compared with standard untreated urinary catheters.235, 279, 280, 281, 282 The consensus in these five reviews of evidence, however, is that the individual studies reviewed are generally of poor quality; for instance, in one case, only eight studies out of 117 met the inclusion criteria,280 and in another, of the six reports describing seven trials included, only one scored five in the quality assessment. The other five reports only scored one.282 The studies included in these reviews investigated a wide range of coated or impregnated catheters, including catheters coated or impregnated with: silver alloy,279, 280, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289 silver oxide,280 gendine,290 gentamicin,291 silver-hydrogel,292, 293, 294 minocycline,294 rifampicin,295 chlorhexidine-silver-sulfadiazine,294 chlorhexideine-sulfadiazine-triclosan,294 nitrofurazone294 and nitrofuroxone.296 Four studies compared the use of silver-coated (silver alloy or silver oxide) catheters with silicone, hydrogel or Teflon\u00ae latex.297, 298, 299, 300 A systematic review and meta-analysis of these and other studies found that silver-alloy-coated (but not silver-oxide-coated) catheters were associated with a lower incidence of bacteriuria.256, 280 Despite their unit cost, these devices may provide a cost-effective option if overall numbers of infections are reduced significantly through their use. However, the few studies that have explored the cost-benefit/cost-effectiveness of using these devices have been inconclusive.285, 287, 289, 291\n",

Although antimicrobial-impregnated catheters reduced the risk of CAUTI, the number of cases was too small to demonstrate a significant effect. The second systematic review, which included nine RCTs and three quasi-experimental studies, concluded that, compared with standard catheters, both nitrofurazone-impregnated and silver-alloy-coated catheters can prevent and delay the onset of bacteriuria during short-term use. However, there were no data on the risk of CAUTI.235\n",

The nitrofurazone-impregnated catheter, but not the silver-alloy-coated catheter, was associated with a significantly lower incidence of bacteriuria (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48\u20130.99, p=0.017). However, the nitrofurazone-impregnated catheter was associated with increased discomfort during the period the catheter was in place. A major limitation of this study was that the median duration of catheterisation was 2 days (range 1\u20133 days) and the risk of CAUTI associated with this short period is correspondingly low. Also, UTIs developing up to 6 weeks post randomisation were included in the outcome measurement, even though they may not have been directly associated with catheterisation. The economic analysis suggested that nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters, but not silver-alloy-coated catheters, may be cost-effective, but the measures of cost were associated with a large amount of uncertainty.",

One study showed that higher rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic CAUTI were associated with a 3-day urinary drainage bag change regimen compared with no routine change regimen.312 Best practice suggests that drainage bags should only be changed when necessary (i.e. according either to the manufacturer's recommendations or the patient's clinical need).258, 302 Reflux of urine is associated with infection and, consequently, drainage bags should be positioned in a way that ensures the free flow of urine and prevents back-flow.270, 302 It is also recommended that urinary drainage bags should be hung on an appropriate stand that prevents contact with the floor.269\n",

Clinical practices are addressed by a wide variety of educational strategies that do not draw upon pedagogic, theoretical or conceptual frameworks and consequently do not provide generalisable conclusions about the most effective approaches to education to improve practice.358 The second systematic review concluded first that educational interventions appear to have the most prolonged and profound effect when used in conjunction with audit and feedback, and when availability of clinical equipment is consistent with the content of the education provided. Second, that educational interventions will have a greater impact if baseline compliance with best practice is low. Third, that repeated educational sessions, fed into daily practice, using practical participation, appear to have a small, additional effect on practice change compared with education alone.228\n",

However, sub-group analysis did not identify the same benefit in terms of CR-BSI. There were no statistically significant differences in the overall rates of bloodstream infections or mortality, although these outcomes were less often assessed than CR-BSI and catheter colonisation.420 A collaborative network meta-analysis of CVC use in adults indicated that rifampicin-based impregnated CVC was the only type of impregnated/coated CVC that reduced catheter colonisation and CR-BSI compared with standard CVC.421 In a single blind non-inferiority trial, authors concluded that CVC coated with 5-fluorouracil were non-inferior to chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine coated CVCs with respect to the incidence of catheter colonisation (2.9% vs. 5.3%, respectively).422\n",

The meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in the risk of CR-BSI between the femoral, subclavian and internal jugular sites, having removed two studies that were statistical outliers. The authors concluded that a pragmatic approach to site selection for central venous access, taking into account underlying disease (e.g. renal disease), the expertise and skill of the operator and the risks associated with placement, should be used.438 Two meta-analyses439, 440 indicate that the use of real-time two-dimensional ultrasound for the placement of CVCs substantially reduced mechanical complications compared with the standard landmark placement technique. Consequently, the use of ultrasound may indirectly reduce the risk of infection by facilitating mechanically uncomplicated subclavian placement. In the UK, NICE guidelines provide recommendations for two-dimensional ultrasound placement of CVCs.441\n",

Three primary research studies, differing in design, patient population and clinical settings, that compared infection outcomes using MSB precautions with less stringent barrier techniques, concluded that the use of MSB precautions resulted in a reduction in catheter-related infections. The authors concluded that using MSB precautions appears to decrease transmission of microorganisms, delay colonisation and reduce the rate of HCAI. They also suggested that biological plausibility and the available evidence support using MSB precautions during routine insertion of a CVC to minimise the risk of infection. They recommended that, given the lack of adverse patient reactions, the relatively low cost of MSB precautions and the high cost of CR-BSI, it is probable that MSB precautions will prove to be a cost-effective, or even a cost-saving, intervention.445\n",

In this analysis, several types of CHG solution were used in the individual trials, including 0.5% or 1% CHG alcohol solution and 0.5% or 2% CHG aqueous solution. All of these solutions provided a concentration of CHG that is higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most nosocomial bacteria and yeasts. Subset analysis of aqueous and non-aqueous solutions showed similar effect sizes, but only the subset analysis of the five studies that used alcoholic CHG solution produced a significant reduction in CR-BSI. As few studies used CHG aqueous solution, the lack of a significant difference seen for this solution compared with PVI solution may be a result of inadequate statistical power. Additionally, an economic decision analysis based on available evidence from the same authors suggested that the use of CHG, rather than PVI, for skin care would result in a 1.6% decrease in the incidence of CR-BSI, a 0.23% decrease in mortality, and financial savings per catheter used.451\n",

The reviewers were unable to conclude if changing administration sets less often than every 96 h affects the incidence of infection from the studies. There were no differences between participants with central vs peripheral catheters, nor between participants who did and did not receive parenteral nutrition, or between children and adults. Administration sets that do not contain lipids, blood or blood products may be left in place for intervals of up to 96 h without increasing the incidence of infection. There is no evidence to suggest that administration sets which contain lipids should not be changed every 24 h as currently recommended.",

The most prominent of these was a study conducted in the ICU setting of 108 hospitals in the USA, which was then adopted by other countries including the UK.525, 526 The authors reported the success of five evidence-based practices combined with system and organisational support, which resulted in a 66% decrease in CR-BSI 18 months after the inception of the programme (incidence rate ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.81 to incidence rate ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.23\u20130.50) and sustained reductions thereafter.525 The intervention comprised: hand hygiene using ABHR; MSB precautions for insertion; cutaneous antisepsis of the insertion site with 2% CHG; avoiding the femoral site; and removing CVCs as soon as they are no longer clinically indicated. In addition, system changes that prompted the clinician to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 included placing all the equipment needed in a cart for ease of access; the use of a checklist; authorising staff to halt procedures if best practice was not being followed; daily rounds to ensure the timely removal of CVCs; feedback of CR-BSI cases to clinical staff; and organisational support to purchase essential equipment and solutions prior to the start of the study.",
