The ring closure of the central ring D proceeded then by Friedel\u2013Crafts cyclization as pioneered by Rapoport et al.,6, 7 the Parham-type cycloacylation8 and intramolecular aldol-type condensation.6, 9 Beyond other racemic experimental protocols10 an alternative and interesting approach based on the construction first of chiral polycyclic systems containing piperidine-2-methanol (A\u2013D) was also developed.11 These key intermediates, when involved in a ring-closing metathesis afford a way to vary the nature and the size of the cycle at the end of the targets enchainment E and are used to produce the molecular diversity.5\n",
