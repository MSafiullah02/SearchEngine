Formation of the signal transducer and activator of transcriptions 1 and 2 (STAT1\u2013STAT2) heterodimer occurs following the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) that are associated with IFNAR2 and IFNAR1, respectively (Marijanovic et al., 2007). These two kinases phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, which together form a complex with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) (Takaoka and Yanai, 2006). The interferon stimulatory factor 3 complex (ISGF3) binds to interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and activates transcription of IFN-\u03b1 inducible genes, including 2'\u20135' oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1), interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and many other IFN-response genes (IRGs) (Uddin and Platanias, 2004).",

Although IFN signaling gene upregulation during viral infection has been the subject of previous reports, there is little information regarding the host immune responses directly induced by viruses versus those that are upregulated due to secondary IFN stimulation (Chelbi-Alix and Wietzerbin, 2007, Haagmans et al., 2004, Loutfy et al., 2003, Cameron et al., 2007). Here we used our previously described ferret model (Chu et al., 2008) to identify genes that were regulated by SARS-CoV infection compared to IFN-\u03b12b stimulation in the ferret model to elucidate immune responses during viral infection. We examined the phosphorylation status of signaling molecules in IFN-\u03b12b-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also analyzed the in vivo gene expression profiles of ferret PBMCs and lung necropsies following IFN-\u03b12b injection during the time course. Evaluation of gene expression patterns in PBMCs and lung necropsies of SARS-CoV-infected ferrets led us to the identification of 7 upregulated IRGs that also were upregulated in response to IFN-\u03b12b injection. Our findings in ferrets suggested IFN-\u03b12b injection and SARS-CoV infection led to similar as well as unique gene expression signatures in a global point of view. Increased knowledge of the interaction of these gene expression signatures may improve our understanding of the immune system of ferrets as a preferred animal model of severe respiratory viral illnesses.",

The peak gene expression occurred at day 2 with a total of 512 upregulated and 550 downregulated (P\n < 0.05) genes (Table 1). Interestingly, the strongest upregulation of several IRGs, such as STAT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, IFI44, IFI44 ligand (IFI44L) and EIF2AK2, occurred on day 1 (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 1). There was a marked increase in the total number of regulated genes from lung necropsies of SARS-CoV-infected ferrets compared to lungs from IFN-\u03b12b-stimulated ferrets (Table 1). The SARS-CoV infected ferrets had a peak in gene expression at day 1 with 4222 upregulated versus 1248 downregulated genes (P\n < 0.05).

JAK1 was the only IRG that was downregulated at day 1 (Fig. 2C). The upregulation of STAT1, MX1, OAS1 and ISG15 was validated with qRT-PCR on lung necropsies of ferrets injected with IFN-\u03b12b or infected with SARS-CoV (Fig. 2D). The comparison of microarray results between the lung tissue of IFN-\u03b12b and SARS-CoV ferrets at day 1 revealed commonalities in the expression patterns of most IRGs.

IRGs are markedly increased in both blood and lung tissue, however the responses in the blood show greater breadth and magnitude as compared with the responses observed in lung tissue (Supplementary Table 2). This suggests that the administration protocol of IFN-\u03b12b used in this study is only capable of inducing a limited activation in lung tissue. Therefore, alternative protocols including direct administration of IFN-\u03b12b into the respiratory tract or subcutaneous administration at higher doses should be explored in order to achieve stronger antiviral responses at the infection sites. Gene expression during SARS-CoV infection, on the other hand, shows the presence of strong antiviral and inflammatory responses in the lungs 24 h post-infection, fading on day 2 post-infection in both blood and lung tissue.",

            "text": "As expected, IFN-\u03b12b stimulates the increased expression of a variety of IRGs that play a central role in the clearance of viral infections, including MX1, OAS1, OAS2 and ISG15. They exert their effects through different mechanisms of action, such as direct targeting of viral entry, inhibition of protein synthesis or degradation of viral RNA. MX1 is a dynamin-like large guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), which has antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses. The antiviral activity of MX1 is effective at the early stages of the viral cycle in the nucleus or cytoplasm (Haller et al., 2007). OAS is an adenylate synthetase, which uses adenosine triphosphate to synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylates. The latter activates latent RNase L that is involved in the degradation of viral RNA (Bonnevie-Nielsen et al., 2005). ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like enzyme that covalently conjugates to a large number of cellular proteins; however this does not usually lead to protein degradation. In the case of HIV-1, ISG15 inhibits the release of virions (Okumura et al., 2006).",

In contrast, several IRGs, including IFI35, IFIT1 and PSMB8, were only upregulated in the lungs during SARS-CoV infection.

In the blood of ferrets injected with IFN-\u03b12b, the upregulation of genes that participate in glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (e.g. acyl-CoA synthetases and lactate dehydrogenases) (Supplementary Table 3) are indicators of higher levels of metabolic activity. Moreover, IFN also induces the expression of genes related with apoptosis (e.g. caspases and TNFSF10) and cell cycle (e.g. cyclins and SMAD family members). It is unclear whether IFN-\u03b12b alone is capable of inducing apoptosis and/or cell replication in vivo, however, the upregulation of these genes may indicate that PBMCs are now more responsive to signals capable of triggering cell cycle events. Upregulation of chemokine receptors, such as CCR3, CCR7, CCR9 and CXCR4 may indicate that IFN-\u03b12b can increase the responsiveness of PBMCs to locally produced chemokines. Likewise, increased levels of genes that are involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration and Fc-gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Supplementary Table 3) suggest that IFN-\u03b12b enhances leukocyte responses (Corssmit et al., 1997). Interestingly, a number of genes that are part to the Wnt signaling pathway were found to be upregulated (Supplementary Table 3). This indicates that in vivo administration of IFN-\u03b12b also has effects over lymphocyte maturation and differentiation (Staal et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Previously, gene regulation has been investigated using microarray analysis with the intent on revealing molecular pathways imperative to H1N1 infection (Shapira et al., 2009). Here we investigated gene regulation of SARS-CoV infected and IFN-\u03b12b injected ferrets. Microarray analysis was conducted on RNA from lungs and blood on day 1 and day 2. The number of upregulated genes was quantified and compared to the number of downregulated genes for each sample type. The number of downregulated genes was greater than upregulated genes in the day 1 IFN-\u03b12b lungs and in the day 2 SARS-CoV infected blood samples. To expose the molecular signature of this finding we then broke down the genes from each group into their respective functional pathways: cellular process, metabolic process, intracellular signaling cascade, cell cycle, and immune response. Interestingly, we found that for every functional pathway the day 1 IFN-\u03b12b-injected lungs had more downregulated genes than upregulated genes (except the immune response) where blood samples from the same animals had the opposite trend of more upregulated genes. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-infected animals had the opposite trend where day 1 lungs had more upregulated genes and in the blood of day 2 there were more downregulated genes. These findings may be indicative of the activity of the stimulant IFN-\u03b12b compared to SARS-CoV. Moreover, the difference in the number of genes regulated shows that IFN-\u03b12b and SARS-CoV have different spatial stimulation which may be an important finding when determining the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-\u03b12b. It is possible that the increase in gene expression in the blood samples following IFN-\u03b12b injection is indicative of activation of systemic immunity where the SARS-CoV infection had an increase of lung gene expression signifying possible local inflammation.",

Whole blood or lung necropsies were collected at day 1 and day 2. mRNA was purified, converted to cRNA and ran on the Affymetrix Canine gene chip II. Hierarchal microarray EDGE analysis demonstrated a cluster of IRGs, which were significantly upregulated (red color).
