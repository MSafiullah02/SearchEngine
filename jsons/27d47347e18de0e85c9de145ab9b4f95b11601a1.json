Methods and results: Ten patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS, and virological confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection were identified. Histology in most cases showed diffuse alveolar damage, from early to late phases, and the changes corresponded to the time sequence. Other variable features include multinucleated giant cells, pneumocytes with cytomegaly and variable amounts of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. One case showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. No viral inclusions were found. Coronavirus particles were identified in pneumocytes by electron microscopy. Conclusions: The predominant pathological process of SARS is diffuse alveolar damage and, in patients who die from the disease, there is evidence of organization and fibrosis. There are apparently no histological features specific for this disease, and the aetiological diagnosis depends on virological and ultrastructural studies.",

Seven of eight cases studied serologically showed a four-fold or greater increase in serum titre for the antibody against SARS coronavirus.

For the open lung biopsy taken on day 9 (patient 1) and lung tissue from two patients who died shortly after the onset of symptoms (patients 2 and 8), the histology was represented mainly by acute (early exudative) phase DAD, with extensive hyaline membrane formation, a variable degree of alveolar haemorrhage and fibrin in alveolar spaces ( Figure 1 ). The open lung biopsy also showed alveolar space and septal oedema. Coincidental background chronic bronchiolitis was present. Three specimens (patients 6, 9 and 10) taken at 11-21 days showed both acute and organizing (proliferative) phase DAD ( Figure 2a ). In addition to air space fibrin and hyaline membrane formation, there was septal widening by loose fibroblastic tissue and air space fibromyxoid tissue plugs. Moreover, all showed squamous metaplasia (Figure 2b ) of the bronchial epithelium and alveolar lining. Three specimens (patients 4, 5 and 7) taken at 29-46 days were characterized by organizing DAD and fibrosis. In addition to interstitial and air space organization, dense septal and alveolar fibrosis became evident ( Figure 3 ). Features of the acute phase of DAD were no longer seen except for a few remnant hyaline membranes. Features of different phases could be seen in different parts of the same sample. For patient 7, there was, in addition, bronchopneumonia, with abundant neutrophils admixed with fibrin in alveolar spaces ( Figure 4 ).",

            "text": "A novel coronavirus (SARS coronavirus) has been shown to be the causative agent of SARS. 1, 9 Coronavirus is an RNA virus known to account for up to 30% of common colds in humans and rarely causes lower respiratory tract disease. 10 Instead, it can cause severe respiratory or enteric disease in livestock and poultry. 10 The SARS coronavirus is a new virus affecting the human population and is distantly related to a previously sequenced human coronavirus. 1, 9 The virus can be found in respiratory tract secretions, lung tissue, serum and stool. 1, 6, 11 The clinical presentation of the SARS patients in this series is similar to those of others. 2,6,12 All presented with fever; other common presenting features are respiratory symptoms and myalgia. While advanced age and presence of pre-existing morbidity have been reported to be associated with adverse outcomes in some series, 2,12 some patients who have succumbed to the disease have been young and otherwise previously healthy. With rare exceptions, the main lung pathology in SARS is DAD, which is basically the histological prototype of acute lung injury. The mechanism is believed to be endothelial and alveolar epithelial cell injury leading to fluid and cellular exudation and subsequent reparative fibroblastic proliferation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. 13, 14 The microscopic appearances depend on the time interval between the insult and biopsy and on the extent of injury. 15 The pathological changes go through discrete but overlapping phases-the early exudative (acute) phase, the proliferative (organizing) phase, and the fibrotic phase. 13, 15, 16 The process does not necessarily evolve through all stages, and may cease and recover at any stage. 15 The cases in this series demonstrate the full spectrum of all three phases of DAD, and the features also correspond well with the time sequence of the disease. The specimens taken within 2 weeks after onset of symptoms typically show classical acute-phase DAD, while those taken between the second to third weeks show acute and organizing features. Specimens taken in the fourth week or after show organizing DAD and the fibrotic stage of DAD, a feature which has not been reported in previous series on SARS. 1, 2, [5] [6] [7] [8] Besides the long interval from symptom onset to death, this last group also had the longest duration of mechanical ventilation and the highest concentration of supplementary oxygen of all the patients; thus these factors might also contribute to the late lung damage. So far, no histological material from SARS patients who recover from the disease has been available for com-parison; presumably the DAD resolves with or without residual scarring. Similar to previous reports, multinucleated giant cells and cytomegaly of pneumocytes can be observed in some cases. 1, 2, [5] [6] [7] [8] The significance of these cells is not known. Some postulate that the cytomegaly with amphophilic cytoplasm may be a result of viral assembly within the Golgi apparatus. 5 In contrast to a previous report, 5 we did not find foamy macrophages to be the predominant inflammatory cell component, but variable mixtures of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils were found instead. One of the patients in the late stage of DAD showed superimposed pneumonia, and electron microscopic study demonstrated coronavirus as well as bacteria, illustrating the presence of secondary infection which could be a complication of either viral pneumonia or corticosteroid treatment.",

Measles, adenovirus, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus and influenza virus are well-recognized viruses that can cause acute lung injury, with a diagnostic cytopathic effect noted in the first four. [17] [18] [19] [20] Hanta virus has also been reported to cause acute lung injury but shows no specific cytopathic effect. 21, 22 The finding of DAD in almost all cases and the persistence of viral particles on electron microscopy even at a late stage (day 46) indicate that SARS coronavirus should be added to the list of causes of acute lung injury manifesting as DAD. The absence of DAD in one patient who had fulfilled all the clinical criteria with positive confirmation test for SARS could be due to a sampling problem, since the paramortem needle biopsy consisted of a few tiny pieces of lung tissue only.",
