Viral RNA was extracted from the samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcL of the provided AVE buffer. Conventional quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) for the specific amplification of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the previously reported TaqMan system with the following sets of primers and probe: 2.4 \u03bcM forward primer, 5\u2032-AAA TTT TGG GGA CCA GGA AC-3\u2032; 3.2 \u03bcM reverse primer, 5\u2032-TGG CAG CTG TGT AGG TCA AC-3\u2032; and 0.4 \u03bcM probe, 5\u2032-FAM-ATG TCG CGC ATT GGC ATG GA-TAMRA-3\u2032 [6]. Thermal cycling was carried out under the following conditions: reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min; initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min; and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60 \u00b0C for 60 s. This study was approved by Saitama Medical University Hospital Research Ethics Committee (Approval No. 19136).

Positive amplification results were monitored by real-time measurement of turbidity with an LA-200 turbidimeter (Eiken Chemical). In this reaction, 10 \u03bcL RNA template was added to 15 \u03bcL of the provided master mix including a set of primers to make a final volume of 25 \u03bcL.

Previous studies using the same molecular diagnostic strategy reported sensitivity ranging from 2.0 \u00d7 10 1 to 1.0 \u00d7 10 2 copies/reaction, indicating that this RT-LAMP test kit has extremely high sensitivity and is also valuable for diagnosis, in terms of not only its convenience but also its detection sensitivity [7, 8] . It is highly specific because it uses a set of four primers that recognize at least six different sequences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the present study, it was considered that there was no nonspecific amplification with the RT-LAMP test kit. The results for two samples, re-collected at more than 1 week after the initial SARS-CoV-2-positive result, were inconsistent with those for RT-qPCR (RT-LAMP was positive, whereas RT-qPCR was negative). This phenomenon may depend on the concentration gradient or the aspiration rate in the RNA extracts because the amount of sample used for RT-qPCR was 5 \u03bcL, while that used for RT-LAMP was 10 \u03bcL.
