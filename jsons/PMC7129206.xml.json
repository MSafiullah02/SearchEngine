Whilst rescue shelters were not the primary source of FCoV for many relinquished cats in the United States, exposure to the shelter environment resulted in amplification of shedding and spread of infection to susceptible individuals (Pedersen et al., 2004). This is not necessarily the case in the United Kingdom.",

Establishment of an individual cat'sinfection status by RT\u2013PCR requires testing of multiple faecal samples (Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Herrewegh et al., 1997). Serological detection of anti-FCoV antibodies is an alternative to detection of virus in faeces by RT\u2013PCR. At any point in time approximately one in three seropositive cats sheds FCoV (Addie and Jarrett, 1992); the higher the antibody titre, the more likely the cat is to be shedding virus (Addie and Jarrett, 2001).",

In the current study cats were only sampled once making demonstration of seroconversion impossible; FCoV seropositivity thus reflects past exposure. Therefore documentation of increasing seropositivity in the population with increasing time spent in the shelter cannot be assumed to represent seroconversion following exposure to the shelter environment. It could also represent a trend for FCoV seropositive cats to remain in the shelter for longer. Increasing time spent in a shelter was associated with increased risk of FCoV seropositivity but this association was not linear. Model fit was significantly improved by considering time in shelter as a binary factor: 60 days or less or more than 60 days.",

            "text": "It is very unlikely that seroconversion in a shelter takes 60 days to occur. A second possibility is that seropositivity may be associated with a reason for shelter staff to retain a cat for longer before re-homing, for example because FCoV infection had induced diarrhoea. However, this population had not been previously tested for anti-FCoV antibodies, so we cannot know when seroconversion occurred. Acute FCoV infection is usually asymptomatic or associated with only mild diarrhoea or upper respiratory signs, and in this study, FCoV seropositive cats were not more likely to be sick at the time of sampling. There was no significant association between FCoV infection and serological results for other infectious diseases. Finally another risk factor for seropositivity may change with increasing time in shelters. When cats enter shelters it is recommended that they be keptisolated from other cats. However, if they remain in a shelter for a prolonged period such as 60 days they are likely to be transferred to group housing and so would transfer to a multi-cat environment which would probably include cats with which they had not previously been in contact. As already demonstrated multi-cat environments are associated with transmission of FCoV. In our opinion this is the most likely explanation for the association of FCoV seropositivity with time spent in a shelter of more than 60 days. A further study following a cohort of cats from the time of shelter entry would be required to ascertain these findings. The reasons for prolonged retention in the shelter and the timing of movement to group housing would also need to be documented.",

Shelters E and I both become associated with greater seropositivity than shelter A. The remaining shelters do not differ significantly from shelter A.

UK shelters appear to be able to successfully rescue cats for up to 60 days without significantly increasing their risk of seropositivity. Increasing risk of seropositivity in cats that remain in shelters for more than 60 days may be associated with a change in management to communal housing.",
