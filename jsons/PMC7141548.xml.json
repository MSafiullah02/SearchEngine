Current research suggests that efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected individuals (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) to uninfected contacts can result from respiratory droplets, aerosols, and direct contact. Other routes, including the fecal-oral and mother-to-child vertical transmission, have not been confirmed. The main clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (known as COVID-19) are fever, fatigue, and cough leading to pneumonia that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome [2], [3]. There are currently several documented cases of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 that had digestive findings as the first sign of disease [4]. We present a case of COVID-19 that presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of hematochezia.",

As the patient was elderly and not specifically symptomatic, follow-up observation was recommended. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed abnormal signals within the seminal vesicle, suggesting the possibility of internal hemorrhage; follow-up prostate MRI was recommended. Colonoscopy was also recommended to clarify the acute colorectal findings and to identify the source of bleeding.",

The patient denied any symptoms including chest tightness, cough, expectoration, or dyspnea. The physical examination on this day was notable for bilateral rough breath sounds and moist rales in the lower right lung. He was treated with dexamethasone injection, and the fever disappeared.",

Nine days later, he developed fever and lung inflammation with throat swabs that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. As such, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. No source of bleeding was identified by colonoscopy or abdominal CT scan and as such, we considered the possibility that hematochezia might be secondary to infection with SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Unfortunately, we did not determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in stool specimens, which may have provided further direct evidence in this case. At this writing, there are several reports of diarrhea associated with the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4], but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of hematochezia as the presenting symptom and chief complaint.",
