The subsequent appearance of high fever (>39 \u2022 C) led to a diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM) by her primary care paediatrician. The patient was treated symptomatically, but the fever remained >39 \u2022 C and the cough became more prominent. After 4 days, O 2 saturation went down to 91% and the child was admitted to hospital in Beer-Sheva, Israel, in January 2011. Upon admission, bilateral AOM was confirmed, and auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds at the base of both lungs. The patient's body temperature was 39 \u2022 C, her respiratory and heart rates were, respectively, 44/min and 132/min, and O 2 saturation was 91%. No other abnormality was found upon physical examination. A nasopharyngeal sample was collected using a flexible pernasal flocked swab and immediately placed in a mini-tube containing 1 mL of universal transport medium (UTM-RT Kit Cat. No. 360c, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) for research purposes. The sample was stored at 4 \u2022 C in the hospital laboratory until it was sent in a refrigerated package to the central laboratory (Pediatric Clinic 1, University of Milan, Italy). Other routine laboratory tests showed haemoglobin 9.9 g/dL, white blood cells (WBCs) 29,960/mm 3 (neutrophils 81.3%), platelets 610,000/mm 3 , glucose 126 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 41.3 mg/L. Blood culture was negative for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as for fungi, as were all of the other viral assays (respiratory virus panel [RVP] fast assay for influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and human bocavirus) and bacterial tests (polymerase chain reaction for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae) of respiratory secretions. Chest X-ray findings led to a diagnosis of left lobar pneumonia, and amoxicillin 80 mg/(kg day) was started. The child recovered after 48 h of hospitalisation and was discharged home with a recommendation to complete 7 days' antibiotic treatment. She experienced no recurrence and no further hospitalisation was needed in the following 12 months.",

His primary care paediatrician diagnosed AOM and the patient was treated with amoxicillin for one day before admission. On the day of admission, the diarrhoea and vomiting stopped. Upon admission, left AOM was confirmed and auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds and crackles at the base of the left lung. The patient's body temperature was 39 \u2022 C, his respiratory and heart rates were, respectively, 64/min and 136/min, and O 2 saturation was 95%. Also in this case, a nasopharyngeal sample was collected for research purposes as in the previous case, which was stored and sent to the central laboratory in the same manner. In this case, routine laboratory tests showed haemoglobin 9.9 g/dL, WBCs 21,200/mm 3 (neutrophils 78.0%), platelets 466,000/mm 3 , and CRP 48.5 mg/L. Blood culture was negative, as were all the other viral and bacterial tests of respiratory secretions (the tests for viruses and bacteria were those performed in the first case). Chest X-ray findings led to a diagnosis of left lobar pneumonia with pleural effusion, and so a chest drain was inserted. The pleural fluid culture (available 5 days after admission) was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 22F, which was sensitive to all of the tested antibiotics. The child was initially treated with cefuroxime i.v. (100 mg/(kg day)), which was changed to ceftriaxone i.v. (100 mg/(kg day)) plus amoxicillinclavulanic acid i.v. (80 mg/(kg day)) after 3 days. When the results of the pleural fluid culture became available, the antibiotic treatment was changed to ampicillin i.v. (80 mg/(kg day) i.v.). The child underwent chest drainage for a total of 14 days, and was discharged after 15 days of hospitalisation in good condition with a recommendation to continue oral amoxicillin treatment for a further week. He experienced no respiratory problems in the following 12 months.",

A partial VP1 sequence was obtained using the primers described by Nix et al. 6 The remaining sequence of the P1 capsid region of both samples was obtained using \"in-house\" amplification protocols (available upon request). The amplicons of expected sizes were gel purified and sequenced. The complete VP1 sequence of ISR-10 was submitted to the Picornaviridae Study Group (http://www.picornastudygroup.com) and designated a proposed new enterovirus type (EV-C118; accession number JQ768163). The amplified partial VP4/VP2 sequence of the EV-C collected from these two children had 67.8% nucleotide identity and 90.5% amino acid identity with EV-C109 (Fig. 1A) , whereas the amplified VP1 regions had 69.9% nucleotide identity and 77.4% amino acid identity.",

It is related to the previously reported EV-C109 and EV-C117, but differ from them in terms of nucleotide and amino acid composition by, respectively, more than 25% and 12%. It can therefore be considered a novel virus type on the basis of either the more or the less stringent classification requirements for designating new EV species. 8 AOM and CAP can be due to viruses, bacteria or both. In our cases, the WBC, neutrophil and CRP values in both children were very high and suggest a bacterial co-infection. Moreover, the pleural fluid culture of one of the children revealed S. pneumoniae, thus confirming the presence of a concomitant bacterial infection. In both children, the manifestation of the disease started with upper respiratory tract signs (associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in one case), and lower respiratory tract involvement occurred later. This suggests a possible initial role of EV-C118 and subsequent superimposed infection due to bacterial pathogens that could have been the main cause of the lower respiratory tract involvement. Further studies are needed to define the etiological and pathogenic role of this new virus but it may be similar to EV-109, which has been associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalisation. 9 Furthermore, other EVs have been found in patients with major respiratory problems. 10, 11 Starting from these cases, we can conclude that EV-C118 seems to be associated with AOM and CAP. Given the potentially negative impact of some HEVs, HEV infections should be closely monitored. First of all, it is important to know the epidemiology of the different strains and, in the case of EV-C118, whether it can be found in countries other than Israel. Moreover, the molecular characteristics of EVs should be adequately analysed as this could significantly aid the preparation of appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic measures. ",

Branch support was assessed by means of bootstrap analyses of 1000 replicates, with a bootstrap value of 70% being used as the cut-off point for cluster analysis. EV-68 and EV-70 were used as the outgroups. (C) Similarity plot of the complete EV-118 capsid-coding sequence using a sliding window of 200 nt moving in 20 nt steps.
