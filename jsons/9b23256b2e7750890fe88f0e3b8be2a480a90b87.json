            "text": "The city of Wuhan, China became the center of an outbreak of an unknown cause of pneumonia in December 2019 and raised intense global attention. Chinese scientists isolated a novel coronavirus from infected patients in Wuhan by January 7, 2020. This strain of coronavirus became formally known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and also referred to as 2019-nCoV. The infection caused by this virus is known as coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) [1] . Cases of COVID-19 are no longer restricted to Wuhan, with the growing number of cases and expanding geographic distribution raising serious questions about the outbreak's future trajectory [2, 3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) called the outbreak of COVID-19 a ''Public Health Emergency of International Concern'' (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 [4] . COVID-19 cases had been recorded around the world, including Western Pacific, European, Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Americas, and African regions. More than 220 countries registered cases of COVID-19 with 1,773,084 confirmed cases and 111,652 deaths worldwide, according to the WHO report on April 13, 2020 [5] .",

In the absence of a known effective treatment and because of the public health emergency, the world is endangered by the risk of a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. According to the WHO [6] , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [7] , and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [8] , there is currently no proven effective drug or vaccine for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Now the world is desperately searching for ways to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and find effective therapies. Drug repositioning (drug repurposing) is the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes. It is a line of scientific research aimed at developing safe and effective treatments for COVID-19 [9] . Therefore, different clinical trials have been conducted to identify possible treatment options for COVID-19. Several existing antiviral drugs, previously developed or used as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, are being investigated as treatments for COVID-19 and some have moved into clinical trials conducted around the globe [10] . According to the CDC, two licensed drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and one investigational agent (remdesivir) are currently in use in the USA [11] . However, remdesivir is not approved by the FDA for a COVID-19 indication [12] . On the other hand, the China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Health Care (CPAM) has released COVID-19 guidelines and recommended the use of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400 mg/100 mg orally twice daily) or chloroquine (500 mg orally two times daily) in critically ill older patients. Hydroxychloroquine (orally 400 mg once daily) is also recommended when chloroquine is unavailable [13] .",

However, any approvals for the use of a new drug, of course, require further clinical testing, followed by the approval of widespread use by the relevant regulatory body for medical treatment in each country. To accomplish this, there is an urgent need for global collaboration, access conditions for public funds, and upfront agreements and affordability arrangements with those involved in the development of new medical technologies. Products for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 should be global public goods. Such a measure requires action at the global level.",
