Practically, more than four billion people in Asia or about 60% of the world's population are at risk of getting rabies where an estimated 96% of documented human cases are from an infected dog bite. Canine-mediated rabies is one of the few communicable diseases that can possibly be eliminated by currently available vaccines and tools for veterinary and public health interventions. With a more comprehensive and integrated approach, it is expected that dog rabies will be eliminated in target areas, and there will be an eventual decline and disappearance of human rabies cases. The burden of rabies is primarily on human health but the disease control has to be focused on the animal source. The ultimate goal of a truly regional disease program is to control and eliminate dog-mediated rabies and protect and maintain rabies-free areas in Asia. Current regional efforts aim to strengthen the intercountry coordination, and technical and institutional capacities to manage dog rabies elimination programs. The regional and national implementation efforts provide strategic direction and cooperation to ensure successful implementation of rabies control measures and eventual elimination. The focus areas include human rabies prevention through pre-and postexposure prophylaxis, mass dog vaccination, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory diagnostic capability, public awareness and risk communication, legislation, dog population management, and establishment and protection of rabies-free zones/",

The estimated number of human deaths across Asia and Africa is approximately 59,000, with over 3.7 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 8.6 billion USD economic losses annually [1] . The vast majority of these deaths is in Asia (59.6%). India, with 35% of human rabies deaths, accounted for more deaths than any other country. Rabies is often neglected when health and agriculture (animal health) agenda and budgets are set even if the costs and economic benefits have long been described [2, 3] . It continues to be neglected and very often its public health impact is minimized by other priority infectious diseases like dengue, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. Reliable data indicating the actual incidence of human rabies and rabies risk exposures are often lacking or non-existent in many countries, leading to the global number of human deaths that is significantly underreported [3] [4] [5] . Canine rabies is not only a major burden in endemic countries where thousands of human deaths occur annually, but also in previously rabies-free areas where risks of re-emergence have been increasing over the last decade [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

The ARES was designed to complement the existing subregional frameworks developed to control and eliminate human rabies, such as those developed by the ASEAN Expert Group on Communicable Diseases (AEGCD) in 2010.

Many national and subnational programs and demonstration projects have proven that proactive mass dog vaccination is much more effective at controlling rabies and less costly than campaigns that vaccinate in response to the occurrence of cases. Control through proactive vaccination followed by two years of continuous monitoring and vaccination should be sufficient to guarantee elimination from any area not subject to repeat introductions [6] . The degree of success of national and global canine rabies elimination efforts, however, depend heavily on effective epidemiological surveillance, which should ensure that intervention impacts can be monitored through time and outbreak responses initiated where necessary. It is recommended that rabies control programs ought to be able to maintain surveillance levels that detect at least 5% (and ideally 10%) of all cases to improve their prospects of eliminating rabies, and this can be achieved through greater intersectoral collaboration [6] .",

Effective community-based approach seeks to strengthen the capacity of families, individuals, organizations, institutions, and systems to support disease programs and outbreak responses. It is expected to contribute in programming to reduce rabies risk and address community vulnerabilities, and enhance community and institutional resilience, being sensitive to the issues directly confronting communities, and desiring to support families and all sectors involved (whole-ofsociety) to take the necessary actions to reduce dog bites and rabies transmission risks. Working through the lowest unit of a community, the family or household unit, is central, as \"more resilient families are the foundation of more resilient communities.\" Individual family units should be fully aware of rabies threats and the required interventions and be the first to take action when these threats appear, such as reporting dog bite incidents to community leaders. The ability of a nation to eliminate rabies starts at household levels-with family members understanding the risks of rabies and being able to systematically mitigate spread, and therefore ensure neighborhood rabies security. Fostering private sector commitment to building and empowering communities through their corporate and human resource is another key element to effective community efforts.",

            "text": "The ASEAN Rabies Elimination Strategy gives particular importance to the organizational and One Health framework for rabies elimination [14] . As an example to understand better, the expansiveness of One Health challenges: In dealing with urban rabies threats, it is recognized that the best single approach is to attack the disease at its source, that is, to eliminate dog-mediated rabies. Eliminating dog rabies greatly reduces the need for postexposure human prophylaxis, at least at some point in time if the process is executed systematically. In this regard, the health sector has been at the forefront of rabies elimination programs. While this traditional principle of rabies elimination is proven to be one of the most well-based and sound of disease control strategies, in reality program implementations are confounded with complexities, resulting in more failures than successes (with only a few established and emerging exemptions). The failures have often been associated with the re-emergence of rabies after it had been temporarily eliminated in the dog population. Even areas (e.g., islands) once rabies-free have encountered emergence and endemic spread of urban rabies [8] [9] [10] . This has been the general situation for many decades. While the prescribed solution is sound and tested, i.e., elimination of rabies at-source, in the overall process, whole-of-society must deal with the complexities of prevailing urban rabies. Detailed scientific argument is not necessary to point out that poverty is a strong driver of rabies endemicity. For example, the massive proliferation of slum areas is directly proportional to rabies proliferation. The survival priorities of people dictate their health and wellbeing-seeking behaviors; obviously, food and shelter come first to those who are hungry and cold. In the same way, hungry stray dogs seek food and shelter, and the proliferations of garbage and market wastes drive these behaviors. Populations, whose general health and wellbeing are deteriorating, will be further drawn into the state of poverty. Where there are people who (must) eat dogs, there will be those who propagate and market dogs legally or illegally. There are a number of undesirable reasons why dogs are able to cross boundaries and islands. And there will always be bad governance that reciprocate bad community participation/cooperation. Such complexities are too numerous to mention all here but are at the heart of why programs fail. Very similar arguments also apply to the continued proliferation and emergence of other infectious diseases [28] . Most significantly, poverty dynamics clearly drive vulnerabilities to diseases [28] [29] [30] , and these include (1) lack of adequate safe food and water; (2) lack of protection from harm such as exposure to pests, inclement weather, pollution, violence, stress, and disasters; (3) extreme social marginalization and deprivation of opportunities to earn a living, to be educated, to receive healthcare; and (4) infliction of collateral harm, especially to woman and children, the disabled and the elderly. Clearly, the determinants of infectious diseases are multifaceted and increasingly complex [31] . Poverty reduction is central, as generally, Poverty Alleviation means Vulnerability Reduction. This has been documented in relation to the likelihood of infectious diseases emergence in impoverished community settings [32] .",

It should be solely focused on rabies elimination (in the meantime), and collaborate as necessary with the health, veterinary, education, environment, industry, and other sectors on clearly defined parameters and terms, with its authority maintained at all levels, i.e., national to local. The structure and mechanism for this could be legislated.
