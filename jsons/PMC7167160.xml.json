Pyrexia is a highly conserved physiological adaptive response that, in the short term, confers an evolutionary advantage, particularly when combating infectious disease (Kluger et al. 1996). The beneficial effects of pyrexia are well understood. In fact, use of antipyretics is controversial in critically ill people, in whom meta\u2010analyses have demonstrated that, at best, their use may not influence outcome, and some studies have even identified increased morbidity and mortality in patients treated with antipyretic therapy (Kluger et al. 1996, Niven et al. 2013).",

Differential diagnoses can be categorised as infectious, non\u2010infectious inflammatory (including immune\u2010mediated), neoplastic and miscellaneous disorders. Studies have previously explored ultimate diagnoses in dogs and cats presenting with pyrexia, with the aim of guiding clinical suspicion and in\u00adforming diagnostic test choices. Two previous studies have demonstrated that immune\u2010mediated disorders were the most common cause of pyrexia, identified in 22% and 34\u22198% of dogs (Dunn & Dunn 1998, Battersby et al. 2006). A third study considered non\u2010infectious inflammatory disease, including immune\u2010mediated disease, as a single category; this was also the most common diagnostic category and was identified in 48% of dogs (Chervier et al. 2012). Interestingly, a recent study in cats found a high prevalence of infectious disease as a cause for pyrexia, which was identified in 38\u22197% of cases (Spencer et al. 2017).",
