The main research bottlenecks were related to understanding pathogen biology, identification of appropriate animal models and investment in the manufacturing sciences, especially into process development. Infrastructure gaps in GMP manufacturing and fill-finish were also identified and limitations in GMO regulation and regulatory and ethical approvals, especially for outbreak pathogens required new policy initiatives.

Alongside these efforts, the UK Chief Medical Officer for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), Dame Sally Davies, raised the question to government and related stakeholders -what could the UK do to be better prepared for future outbreaks of infectious diseases? A partnership was instigated across the DHSC, the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), who then worked together to establish a 'UK Vaccine Network' (UKVN, www.gov.uk/government/groups/ uk-vaccines-network) bringing together a small number of specialists from industry, academia and relevant funding bodies to make targeted investments in specific vaccines and vaccine technology for infectious diseases with the potential to cause an epidemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "At its inaugural meeting in July 2014 the UKVN discussed potential priority areas for investment.

The group created a visual process mapping tool to better understand the potentially ratelimiting bottlenecks associated in moving a vaccine candidate from discovery through to development and early Phase clinical trials; then into clinical manufacture and Phase 3 trials. The primary purpose of the tool was to act as a visual aid for early discovery and development scientists, highlighting the major steps required to fully develop any experimental vaccine. The secondary, and crucial purpose of the tool, was to identify any generic bottlenecks that may slow down development. Identifying such strategic limitations may identify corrective actions, that may in turn help to overcome potential delays or setbacks when expediting vaccine development during epidemics. Actions could be taken by policy makers to correct for limitations in regulation, funders to identify limits in scientific knowledge that could be corrected with appropriate investment, and for government and trans-national organisations to consider local and global response. Though the genesis of this tool was considered in the context of epidemic preparedness, the tool itself is sufficiently far-reaching that it can be utilized by the wider vaccine community. Considering the global nature of vaccines, it is important to understand the interdependencies that exist between discovery, development and manufacture. This tool gives scientists vision of the considerations that will need to be made along the development process. In taking a much more holistic approach to vaccine development it is hoped that this can sup-port other international such as the Global Vaccine Action Plan [8] , which relies on the continued supply of vaccines to meet immunization targets.

Process schematics were made, and members undertook interactive discussions to add in, remove, and reorganise steps. The UKVN Secretariat led on organising a series of iterative workshops that repeated this process several times; each time a skills gap analysis was carried out to ensure appropriate expertise was representing different disease/vaccine interests, and from across the vaccine sector from academic and industry discovery, development, regulation, manufacturing and clinical trials. The repeated process of interactive mapping, refinement of core documents, and presentation of progress back to the subgroups stimulated dialogue on the map as a whole.

An additional important consideration, was that the identification of these bottleneck 'nodes' should be sufficiently generic so as to be applied to a range of vaccine types, and pathogens -thus WG3 refined the key steps to common denominators that were shared across approaches.

Clinical trials require great investment and resource to execute, and the lengthy nature of the process could itself be described as a bottleneck; for the purposes of the tool however, we highlight fives steps within clinical development. Current GMO regulations do not distinguish vaccines based on viral vectors, or live, replication incompetent vectors based on bacteria and viruses. Current regulation stipulates that use of GMO vaccines is done so under 'contained use' or 'deliberate release' protocols to prevent release into the environment.
