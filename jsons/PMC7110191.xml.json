In addition, the QIAamp method involves the use of ethanol, a known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitor that also requires storage and waste disposal management. Ease of use and the fewer steps involved in the MagaZorb protocol result in a faster turn-around time; processing of 5 samples can be completed within 50 min, compared with 70 min with the QIAamp protocol.",

The SUPERase-IN was from Ambion. Reaction mixtures were cycled in the Smart Cycler with use of the following conditions: 60\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 120 s and 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and at 60\u00b0C for 30 s with Optics ON.

It has been well established that, without the intervention of antiretroviral therapy, 20%\u201345% of HIV-1-infected women transmit HIV to their infants [11]. Maternal antibodies against HIV can cross the placenta and persist in infants for \u2a7e18 months; thus, antibody tests cannot be reliably used to identify HIV infection in infants. The most reliable detection method currently available is the nucleic acid-based assay to detect the presence of HIV nucleic acid in blood samples from infants [12]. Because most of the infected infants reside in remote areas of resource-poor countries, to make the detection service available to these infants, blood is collected on a filter paper (eg, Whatman 903 paper) by finger or toe pricking, dried at room temperature, and packaged in a humidity-proof bag with desiccants to prevent the build-up of humidity, which causes degradation of RNA and DNA in DBS specimens after prolonged storage at \u221220\u00b0C. These DBS specimens are transported to a central laboratory for processing and detection using PCRbased assays. The most frequently used PCR product in resource- limited countries in Africa and Asia is the qualitative Amplicor DNA Assay (version 1.5; Roche) [12].",
