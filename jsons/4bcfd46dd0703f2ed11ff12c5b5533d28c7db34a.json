The traditional approach of contact tracing is time consuming, manpower intensive, dangerous and prone to error due to fatigue or lack of skill. Due to this there is an emergence of mobile based applications for contact tracing. These applications primarily utilize a combination of GPS based absolute location and Bluetooth based relative location remitted from user's smartphone to infer various insights. These applications have eased the task of contact tracing; however, they also have severe implication on user's privacy, for example, mass surveillance, personal information leakage and additionally revealing the behavioral patterns of the user. This impact on user's privacy leads to trust deficit in these applications, and hence defeats their purpose.",

They further recommended that for a given disease, the social distancing should be activated without delay (considering its R 0 value) and for a relatively long period. When the virus has high mortality rate then the social distancing is implemented as a complete lockdown, which requires closing roads, restricting travel, and community-level quarantine. In case the transmission has age or gender bias or if it is a more infectious strain, Authors then more restrictive steps need to be taken, for example, offices and workplaces must also be closed down [12] . The lockdown approach is useful in limiting the spread of infectious diseases; however it also has a long-term detrimental effect on a nation's economy [14, 15] . Also, the rising unemployment and social isolation due to lockdown gravely impacts an individual's health in various ways [22, 25] . Furthermore, it is very difficult to answer 'what should be the correct duration for lockdown?' as it depends on multiple factors, for example, demography, availability and quality of health services, population density, economic condition and political will power. This implies that we require an alternate method which eases the pressure on available infrastructure and humans alike.",

Moreover, it also makes individuals aware about the situation and pushes a potentially infected person to self-quarantine [25] . This in turn effectively helps in reducing the R 0 value. Traditionally contact tracing involves manual follow up of the known patients and then interviewing them for identifying the places that they visited and the individuals with whom they had contact in last few days. These identified individuals with asymptotic or mild symptoms are then isolated for further observation and containment. The process is cumbersome, error prone and potentially dangerous for the person performing the activity [25] .

This sensitivity towards data privacy is more profound if the application also deals with user's health data [1] .
