Among humans, RNA viruses are the most frequent agent to cause the common cold, usually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract illness (Heikkinen and J\u00e4rvinen, 2003). Viruses are also frequently associated with paediatric lower respiratory tract disease (Klig and Shah, 2005, Hayden, 2004). Human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) are among the most commonly detected while human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and members of the genus Coronavirus also contribute to respiratory illness including severe disease (Hayden, 2004, Fouchier et al., 2005, van der Hoek et al., 2005, Selwyn, 1990, Hall, 2001).",

Human coronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 was first described in January 2005 following detection in a patient with pneumonia. Further studies in an HCoV-SARS-negative population identified a single case. Apart from the two cases in Hong Kong reported in 2005, only one other instance of HCoV-HKU1 has been reported (Woo et al., 2005, Allander et al., 2005). This suggested that the putative Group 2 coronavirus had a very low incidence (Woo et al., 2005). More recently, human bocavirus (HBoV) was described and tentatively classified as the first member of the family Parvoviridae, genus Bocavirus to cause disease among humans (Allander et al., 2005). HBoV occurred in 3.1% of hospitalized patients and in 17.6% of these detections, a coinciding microbe was also present.",

These values are significantly greater than those reported in the original publications describing HCoV-HKU1 in Hong Kong and HBoV in Sweden. Our detections of these two viruses provided a putative aetiologic cause for ARTI in 16 previously undiagnosed subjects. Based on these data we recommend the inclusion of HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV testing in routine laboratory screening of children and adults with suspected ARTI during the colder months. Co-detections were not common with HCoV-HKU1 infection and our data strongly suggests that apparent respiratory disease may often be the result of infection by this coronavirus. By comparison, 55.6% of all HBoV-infected patients were also infected with another virus, most frequently HRSV, which is a well-characterised cause of mild to severe ARTI. In the original description of HBoV, Allander et al. (2005) reported that 17.6% of positives were co-detected with another virus namely one incidence of HAdV and two of HRSV. However, it was unclear what other microbial targets had been screened for in that population; therefore, it is to be hoped that future studies can contribute to this issue (Allander et al., 2005). Currently neither HCoV-HKU1 nor HBoV can be associated with ARTI until more detailed, carefully controlled community and hospital-based studies are performed to elucidate the full spectrum of disease resulting from infection.",

Such conclusions will be reached more rapidly if comprehensive studies can define the annual incidence of these viruses and the prevalence of infection within the broader community. Additionally, targeted studies are needed to investigate the role of these putative pathogens among the elderly and the immunocompromised. Nonetheless, we have shown that HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV both occur in children with suspected acute respiratory tract disease and that the two viruses contribute significantly to the total microbial burden at our hospital during winter. We recommend that HCoV-HKU1 be considered in the laboratory diagnosis of ARTI during autumn and winter and that further studies are needed to define the role of HBoV in ARTI.",
