However, by the summer of 2009, there were reports of isolates with an amino acid change from histidine (H) to tyrosine (Y) at position 275 in the neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein that was linked to oseltamivir resistance (Chen et al., 2009; Harvala et al., 2010; Janies et al., 2010; Thabet et al., 2010; WHO, 2009a) . Some of these cases were identified in Alberta, Canada starting in July 2009. Although the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance in the 2009-2010 respiratory season has been low, there have been instances in the recent past of dramatic increases in oseltamivir and adamantane resistance in seasonal influenza A (IFVA) over a relatively short time frame in the absence of selective pressure by anti-viral usage (Deyde et al., 2007; Dharan et al., 2009; Hauge et al., 2009; Hurt et al., 2009; Janies et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2009; Pabbaraju et al., 2010; Sheu et al., 2008) . Resistance to oseltamivir has been reported to result from point mutations in several regions of the NA protein of the virus (e.g., D79G, S247G or S247N, and H275Y) (Sheu et al., 2008) . Phylogenetic studies have revealed that the oseltamivir-resistant seasonal IFVA (H1N1) strain evolved from a susceptible strain (clade 2B) which circulated in the 2007-2008 season by acquiring the H275Y change in the NA gene .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 190, "text": "(Dawood et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 414, "end": 433, "text": "(Chen et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 434, "end": 455, "text": "Harvala et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 456, "end": 476, "text": "Janies et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 477, "end": 497, "text": "Thabet et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 498, "end": 509, "text": "WHO, 2009a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 921, "end": 941, "text": "(Deyde et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 942, "end": 962, "text": "Dharan et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 963, "end": 982, "text": "Hauge et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 983, "end": 1001, "text": "Hurt et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1022, "text": "Janies et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1043, "text": "Nelson et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1067, "text": "Pabbaraju et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1086, "text": "Sheu et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1273, "text": "(Sheu et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Currently, the gold standard method for detection of the C823T nucleotide polymorphism that leads to the H275Y amino acid change is dideoxy Sanger sequencing of the NA gene.

The current gold standard methods for detection of resistance include phenotypic detection using the NA-Star \u00ae assay from Applied Biosystems or genetic detection of relevant mutations using Sanger sequencing. Both of these methodologies are labor intensive, time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, phenotypic methods require viral culture which may not be feasible for novel sub-type influenza viruses that are restricted to high-level biosafety environments. Other methods such as reverse-transcriptase PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (RTPCR-RFLP), pyrosequencing, microarray and multiplex RT-PCR with Luminex detection technologies have also been reported for detection of resistance but require specialized equipment and training (Bolotin et al., 2009; Carr et al., 2008; Deyde et al., 2009 Deyde et al., , 2010 Guo et al., 2009; Hindiyeh et al., 2010; Mahony et al., 2010; Operario et al., 2010; van der Vries et al., 2010) . Real-time RT-PCR using probe technology is now commonplace in molecular diagnostic laboratories; these assays are highthroughput and amenable to large scale testing of patient samples with a quick turn-around time for results. Many laboratories are currently equipped to utilize SNP hydrolysis probes for the detec-tion of oseltamivir resistance in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. This approach has been reported previously for the detection of the C823T mutation in seasonal H1N1 (Bolotin et al., 2009; Carr et al., 2008; Operario et al., 2010) and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses (Hindiyeh et al., 2010; van der Vries et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 234, "text": "(Dawood et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 235, "end": 256, "text": "Harvala et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 257, "end": 280, "text": "Pabbaraju et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 281, "end": 301, "text": "Thabet et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1095, "text": "(Bolotin et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1114, "text": "Carr et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1133, "text": "Deyde et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1154, "text": "Deyde et al., , 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1172, "text": "Guo et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1195, "text": "Hindiyeh et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1216, "text": "Mahony et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1239, "text": "Operario et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1267, "text": "van der Vries et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1769, "text": "(Bolotin et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1788, "text": "Carr et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1811, "text": "Operario et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1868, "text": "(Hindiyeh et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1896, "text": "van der Vries et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The possible caveats of using SNP probes to detect H275 and H275Y include the presence of mutations in the probe region adjacent to the SNP positions.
